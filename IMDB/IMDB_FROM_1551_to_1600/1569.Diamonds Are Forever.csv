0,MartinHafer,This film is all about self-parody and going through the motions,6,23 March 2008,"Once again, Bond is back and the film has almost nothing to do with the original Ian Fleming novel by the same name. However, what is different is that after a one film hiatus, Sean Connery is back--too bad the film, in many ways, sucked. That's because by now, the plots seemed more like comic books and the character of Bond seemed more like self-parody than anything else. While in the past Connery played his character rather straight, here he was playing a smirking and smug guy--as if he was looking at the camera and saying ""ain't I cute?"". In subsequent Roger Moore films, this also, unfortunately was the general pattern.Some of the silliness was still watchable and fun--such as the two gay assassins. They were far from subtle but provided some welcome color to the film. However, Jill St. John, though a gorgeous lady, was too whiny and ""kooky"" to be playing a serious character. Nitwit Bond girls are annoying and she was about as bad as Britt Ekland in THE MAN WITH THE GOLDEN GUN--yuck.As far as the bad guy goes, Blofeld is back but he seems nothing like the Telly Savalas or Donald Plesence versions. Supposedly he underwent plastic surgery--but could this explain how he was different in EVERY way?! Plus, having Charles Gray play Blofeld was stupid, as he was one of Bond's friends and was killed in YOU ONLY LIVE TWICE.Still, despite many shortcomings, this is a watchable adventure movie--but also, unfortunately, the worst of the original Connery Bond films. A bit less than two decades later, Connery returned to make a ""new"" Bond film (NEVER SAY NEVER AGAIN), but the less said about this awful film, the better.",Diamonds Are Forever
1,TheLittleSongbird,"Has its moments, but for a Bond film it feels rather weak",4,8 August 2010,"I thoroughly enjoy the James Bond movies, but Diamonds are Forever is not really among the best. In fact, this is not only Sean Connery's weakest film as Bond, but it is also one of the weaker Bond films. It does have its saving graces, but it is very disappointing.It has its saving graces I admit- The Las Vegas sequences were very nicely done, and Bruce Glover and Putter Smith make an interesting double act as the gay hit men. And the scenery and photography is striking, plus the main theme song sung by Shirley Bassey is wonderful.However, the plot is a bit of a mess. It seems simple certainly, but it is badly underdeveloped. I think they should have reinforced the idea of using Gert Frobe as Goldfinger's twin brother, I think that would have elevated the film if included. Then we have a tacky script that relies too much on slapstick and unfocused direction. And the acting is not great, Sean Connery is my favourite Bond mainly due to his suavity and charisma but he seems bored and uninterested here and gives an unusually flat performance in the role, while Charles Gray did nothing for me as Blofeld and Jill St John makes for an unmemorable Bond girl.Overall, rather weak but has its moments. 4/10 Bethany Cox",Diamonds Are Forever
2,bkoganbing,Not Just A Girl's Best Friend,6,16 May 2009,"For what he thought would be his farewell appearance as James Bond, Sean Connery starred in Diamonds Are Forever which takes James Bond from the Amsterdam diamond market, to the Las Vegas Strip, to the deep blue sea. What starts as an investigation into some diamond smuggling eventually turns into another of SPECTRE's schemes for world domination by their number one, Ernest Stavro Blofeld played here by Charles Gray.After George Lazenby failed to ignite much passion in the role of 007, producer Albert Broccoli paid dear for Sean Connery's services to return as Bond. A nice two million dollar paycheck, probably it would be ten million in today's dollars. Connery was probably feeling very generous because he had finally scored in commercial hit in another role with The Anderson Tapes is immediately preceding film. Jill St. John and Lana Wood earn their wings as Bond girls, especially St. John who is a diamond smuggler being ripped off by SPECTRE. Of course the charm's of 007 were never more effectively employed in turning that woman's loyalties, or at least not since Honor Blackman as Pussy Galore in Goldfinger. But Bond employs different skills to deal with Trina Parks and Lola Larson as Bambi and Thumper a pair of skilled lesbian assassins.I guess in recognition of the Stonewall Rebellion SPECTRE decided to go gay as well. And they weren't going to discriminate either, Putter Smith and Bruce Glover are a pair of gay males in the contract killing business and they're pretty good at it too. There's is the final encounter with 007 in Diamonds Are Forever.Jimmy Dean plays Willard Whyte a Howard Hughes like reclusive gazillionaire with Bruce Cabot as his chief assistant and voice to the outside world. How they figure in SPECTRE's plans you have to see the film for, but let's say that Howard Hughes's far flung empire is something to keep in mind. In fact I'm not sure why Hughes didn't sue Cubby Broccoli.Diamonds Are Forever marked the farewell movie role for Bruce Cabot. In his last years Cabot could always get work with John Wayne, Diamonds Are Forever marks one of his few non-Wayne films he was in.Like From Russia With Love and You Only Live Twice, this film also has to do with yet another scheme for SPECTRE to gain control of outer space from the super powers. It's not near as good as the first one and Goldfinger which are my two favorite Sean Connery Bond films, but the 007 cult around the world should be pleased with this film.",Diamonds Are Forever
3,Leofwine_draca,"Sure, it's cheesy - and more than a little dated - but it is fun",6,21 June 2016,"Sean Connery's return to the series - after the spectacular box-office failure of ON HER MAJESTY'S SECRET SERVICE starring nobody George Lazenby - is a stunt-filled adventure film with a tongue placed very firmly in cheek. Whereas the initial Bond adventures were always careful to keep themselves rooted in reality with only the odd fantastical element slipping in here and there, by now the serious had become pure fantasy filled with impossible gadgets, incredible situations and only a passing resemblance to realism. This is the series at a kind of comedy peak, with the familiar series components of high-speed chases, hi-tech gadgetry and gorgeous love interests, but a level of humour that makes the subsequent Roger Moore movies seem tame by comparison.The ageing Connery once again invests his role with a certain enthusiasm, even if the stunt double is becoming all-too common by this time. His enemy here is perhaps the most remembered of the series, Blofeld, this time played by Charles Gray, following in the footsteps of Donald Pleasence and Telly Savalas. Gray lends a suave menace to the role of Blofeld (in fact three characters, but two are doubles!) and seems to be savouring his lines - he's great as the old-fashioned dastardly bad guy. Jill St. John is the rather forgettable love interest although she's certainly beautiful, but Lana Wood makes a small but unforgettable appearance as 'Plenty O'Toole' in her one-scene appearance. The series regulars are on hand to trade witticisms with Bond once again, and there are some memorable supporting villains like the homosexual hit-man duo of Mr Wint and Mr Kidd (at least I think that was their names).The globe-trotting action takes in Amsterdam and Las Vegas this time around, culminating with an explosive action set-piece on an oil rig in the Atlantic. There are many varied locations used, from action in hotel rooms, circuses, gambling halls and even the desert. There are only two chase scenes in the movie but both are goodies; the first is an amusing chase through the desert (Connery in space buggy (!) and his opponents on bikes) in which the bad guys can't seem to stay upright, and the second is a late-night cruise through Las Vegas with the entire police force in hot pursuit. Here you'll see some of the dumbest cops imaginable losing out to Bond's driving skill. Finally, the action set-pieces are also rather good. The standout is a fight to the death in an old-fashioned lift, of all places, featuring Connery going fist-to-fist with boxer Joe Robinson. Near the end Bond must also take on two female fighters, Bambi and Thumper, who certainly give the broadening star a run for his money in terms of athleticism. Add in to this some hair-raising near-death experiences - including a fantastic escape from a crematorium (!) and a good finale, and what you have is a textbook example of a solid if not spectacular Bond film.",Diamonds Are Forever
4,SnoopyStyle,Sean Connery returns as Vegas Bond,6,17 December 2013,"Sean Connery returns and kills Blofeld in the first 10 minutes. Then he's put onto the case of missing South African diamonds. He assumes the identity of diamond smuggler Peter Franks. But his investigation leads him to Las Vegas and an unexpected nemesis.This is probably one of the weaker Bond movie. It is just not exotic to be stuck in Vegas for so long. It's the difference between real locations and Hollywood sets. Vegas could be fun, but it's not exotic. Although, it is interesting to see the old style Vegas before the modern built-up.The best new names have to be Bambi and Thumper. They are amazingly hot bodyguards. And then we got sexy Jill St. John firing her gun in a bikini. No matter what happens, a Bond movie will usually have great Bond girls.There is more sly humor than ever before. There are the sarcastic killer pair Mr Kidd and Mr Wint with their dead pan humor. The sexual innuendos are thicker than ever. There is a bad Roger Moore quality to this Bond movie. Only Moore knows how to do it with a nudge and a wink. The moon rover chase is one of the stupidest thing ever. And there isn't anything superior in any of the designs either. A tiny oil platform isn't that impressive for an evil hideout.",Diamonds Are Forever
5,Horst_In_Translation,"Not one of my favorite Bond films, but individual scenes make it a decent watch nonetheless",6,28 April 2020,"""Diamonds Are Forever"" is a British 2-hour movie from 1971, so next year this one will have its 50th anniversary. Hopefully Sean Connery will live to see this day too because obviously this is another movie from the long-running 007 franchise. But first things first: This film was really an expert affair because director Guy Hamilton as well as his two writers Maibaum and Mankiewicz have worked on many other Bond films as well. This movie was nominated for an Oscar for its sound, but lost out to ""Fiddler on the Roof"". I already mentioned Sean Connery here and this film was his first of two comebacks, so it also could have been titled ""Never Say Never"" without the ""Again"" at the end. Lazenby ended his Bond career after one movie and they did all they could to bring Connery back and money (not just diamonds) makes the world go round and he eventually agreed to do one more 007 film. I found it a bit interesting that when we see the character early on looking for Blofeld and ""gently"" questioning several other characters where the main antagonist could be, we don't see the face initially, at least not during the fiirst two or three interrogations. I can imagine very well that back then (without the internet spoiling everything) many people did not know that Connery would be back when they decided to watch this movie. Oh well, of course it is possible that they saw a poster, read it in the paper or heard it on the radio, but I kinda like this idea of a surprise then. The presentation of his comeback surely was nicely done. I basically liked the entire prologue here with Blofeld and his look-alikes and when he kills the real one, then the prologue is over and the opening credits roll in before the film takes us on a completely different journey. Or at least we are supposed to think it does. As for the opening credits here, Shirley Bassey delivers as always with her song that has the same title like this movie. It is certainly one of my preferred Bond songs.Let's take a look at the villains here. Eventually we find out that it is once again Blofeld who is behind all this and looking at the idea of him creating ""clones"" of himself in the opening, I maybe was more surprised than I should have been that he is alive. But I am glad he is because his scenes were still among the better moments the film had to offer. The action sequence with him trying to get away did not impress me that much honestly, but the scene when he was in control and there together with this other Blofeld did. The idea of the cat giving the right one away, but then it was the wrong cat, was really, really entertaining. One of the best moments of the film for sure. Dr. Metz was alright too. There is not too much to say about him, but the scene with him and Bond posing as a safety inspector was pretty good, especially when the real inspector enters the place and Metz's character's face expression there is priceless. He was already annoyed enough by the fake one. Metz also shows up later on briefly proving that he is not as insane as Blofeld, but there he does not really have the material to add anything else. And the two who absolutely need to be mentioned here are Mr. Kidd and Mr. Wint. There is only speculation, but taking into account both Bond's comment at the end about the aftershave as well as one of the two's heartbroken face expression when the other died, it can be said that it is very likely they were also romantically involved. They could not be too open about that half a century ago, but I'd say that Bardem's antagonist not too long ago is not the first gay villain in a Bond movie. I also liked the duo in general with their sadistic, yet professional and almost elitist approach to assassinating people. I am glad to see the two actors are alive as well. And I am also surprised to see that the one who played Mr. Kidd was only 30 years old back then, or maybe even in his late 20s depending on when they shot his scenes. He looked much older. Anyway, these two also get the final scene of the movie and that is a bit of a tradition for Bond. When the main antagonist is defeated, his biggest helper(s) get(s) their fair share of screen time by challenging Bond on their own. Nick Nack did it, the guy with the metal arm did it and so do these two. The bomb cake was of course another highlight, also with the name, and one of the two refusing to tell the Bond girl about the recipe. But the burning food scene when their covers are blown was also really spectacular. And how the second is killed by Bond certainly has a bit of comedy to it with Bond mocking them and their genitals and maybe also their sexual orientation. I mean it was not so cool that there was less tolerance back then, but I definitely like that there was less political correctness. Besides, the duo's ways of killing were also pretty spectacular. Be it the scorpion, be it the plane crash (also with the comment about God not wanting men to fly) or be it the coffin scene that involves Bond directly. I mean almost nobody got so close to killing 007. He was basically rescued (just like in ""Goldfinger"") because he had information the villains wanted. This time through fake diamonds. However, as soon as Bond realizes who these two are, they have no chance against him. They aren't trained in a way to be able to physically cope with Bond. The one who is is the guy whose identity Bond steals. The one he fights for life and death in the elevator. Pretty good scene too. So much action on such small space. Nicely filmed this one, perhaps the best achievement in terms of camera work. And finally, Bambi and Thumper are alright as well in their one scene. They are off to a headstart because Bond sees sexual partners in them (especially in Thumper) before realizing that they are very skilled fighters.One thing where this film falls really flat are the Bond girls. I would not really count Bambi and Thumper there (one of the two has never been in another film by the way, so I wonder how she got cast here), but Tiffany Case and Plenty O'Toole may have fine names, but are perhaps my personal choice for weakest Bond girl ensemble from any Bond movie. One of them dies quickly after showing up anyway and the other is simply not good enough or attractive enough to really carry the Bond girl component on her shoulders alone. I am of course talking about Jill St. John here. Her introduction with the different hair colors was still alright, but almost everything else that followed was kinda forgettable. And it means something if I say so as I normally like ginger girls. Anyway, Blofeld made a statement about what she was hiding in her pants at the very end and that was a pretty hilarious statement, even in the German dub. Maybe actually better than in the English original I don't know. And he also says something that she is pretty stunning (I mean he isn't wrong, she is not homely or anything), but pretty dumb too and I sort of agree there. I am a bit surprised she is the one who prevails here and in the end goes on a cruise with 007, so we see her as a potential partner even. He is so above her. And not just in the bedroom. It's kinda ironic that when Bond is out for revenge for what happened to Tracy in the previous movie (the one with Lazenby), the Bond girl(s) they give us here do not have 1% of Tracy's class. Anyway, it is what it is. The Bond girl actresses are also both still alive by the way. Actually, many people from this movie are. Definitely surprising looking at how old it is already. Sadly, the good guys really aren't except Connery. The actors who played Q, M, Moneypenny, Leiter and Whyte are long gone. As for Q, he does not have much screen time here, but it is still more (accurately) than in the first two Roger Moore films. As for Moneypenny, she also only has one scene when she makes a joke about how Bond should marry her when he is back from the Netherlands. Not gonna happen. There you have one country where the film is set this time. Another would be the United States, but this is no big surprise I guess with Leiter being around.I personally struggled a bit with the overall plot. It felt slightly random how it all unfolded. Why Bond was where he was in several scenes, but also what kind of action took place and why. In the last third, we get an okay revelation though. The two henchmen stealing all these diamons for Blofeld did not have a financial (or at least not the obvious financial) background, but he put them on a gigantic satellite to create a laser that could destroy entire cities. Okay, it was really absurd, but I liked it nonetheless somehow. Pretty cool idea. Also how they showed said laser at work with the exploding submarine for example, even if at the very end it became a bit too much action-centered for my taste. It's alright though. After the bad guy's hideout explodes, there are still other good scenes like the one with the two potentially gay guys on the ship I mentioned. That is the approach to Bond that I like. And by the way, even this action sequence was nice because realistically it did not try to convince us Bond was doing it all on his own, but he had governments and trained army pilots behind him. Also another thing very briefly included here is the Cold War reference. But it is really not at the center at all the way it is in later Bond films. Only a brief mention how the two global powers assured each other that it was not them who attacked each other. The space reference also reminded me a bit of Moonraker when we see the giant laser satellite. What reminded me even more of that was the scene when Bond is at that laboratory or science station and hides in a room that has them simulate a moon landing (obvious reference to what happened two years earlier). Cool stuff and also slightly funny when we see how these two in their uniforms try to catch Bond when they realize he is the intruder everybody is looking for. They are moving in such a clumsy fashion. Watch it.",Diamonds Are Forever
6,mark.waltz,The diamonds glisten but this isn't quite the genuine article.,4,4 December 2017,"With a gap of one film, Sean Connery returned to the role of James Bond for the last time (as part of the official series), and what he gets is certainly action packed, thrilling and completely entertaining, but seems to be minus the spark and the likability. He's on the case of a diamond smuggling ring run by another white cat carrying villain (Charles Gray) where there's more to the story than just diamonds. Along the way, Bond goes through a crematorium, car chases in Las Vegas and takes on two tough kicking women's gymnasts. Then, his encounters with Gray appear confusing thanks to the multiple lookalikes he has, several meeting some fascinating if gruesome demises.Gray in drag makes Gene Hackman in ""The Bird Cage"" look like Marilyn Monroe, but fortunately that's just a quick blur. I wasn't crazy about the Bond girls in this entry, with an obnoxious characterization by Jill St. John and an unmemorable performance by Lana Wood. The two fast moving gymnasts may be challenging partners for Connery but I really wanted to see them get more than they ended up getting. Gray does make a fascinating bad guy, and there are some moments where you may be biting your knuckles may be sore from biting them. But many of the twists and situations are weak and unconvincing, and that makes this less likable. Still, there's another Shirley Bassey song to get the action started, indeed one of the best themes.",Diamonds Are Forever
7,classicsoncall,"""You handle those cubes like a monkey handles coconuts.""",6,3 December 2018,"Compared to the high tech world of present day James Bonds, ""Diamonds Are Forever"" is hopelessly comical and hokey when viewed today. It's almost like a parody of the spy genre. Even though I haven't seen many of the Bond films, I always considered Sean Connery to be my favorite but this flick makes me want to reconsider. When he first showed up on screen I was taken aback by his aged appearance, looking quite much older than his forty years at the time. And the picture itself is even cheesier than ""Goldfinger"", which at least had that that uniquely creative, gold painted first victim. When Bond used that moon buggy to escape the bad guys, the picture began to feel like one of those Wile E. Coyote/Roadrunner cartoons and I couldn't help but groan at the sight. Story wise, the diamond smuggling concept started out strong but seemed to get frittered away as the film progressed. Even Jill St. John seemed miscast as Bond villain Tiffany Case. I hate to say it, but you probably don't need to watch any of the other Sean Connery Bond pictures to know that this one was the worst, a movie that couldn't be saved even by Shirley Bassey's title song.",Diamonds Are Forever

For one, we have Q as a thief. I suppose being a spy agency's gadget man gives you some leeway, but I don't think you are supposed to steal from slot machines! As far as Bond girls go, Jill St. John is probably on the top half of a list running from best to worst. Strangely enough, I know her more as a mob moll than a Bond girl.

9,jboothmillard,Diamonds Are Forever,4,13 July 2005,"The original star of the series only returned, following the one and only film from George Lazenby, when producers paid him over $1,000,000, which he donated to the Scottish International Education Trust, but it is one the less successful entries, based on the book by Ian Fleming, directed by Guy Hamilton (The Colditz Story, Goldfinger, Battle of Britain, Live and Let Die). Basically James Bond 007 (Sir Sean Connery) pursues formerly head of SPECTRE (Special Executive for Counter- intelligence, Terrorism, Revenge and Extortion), Ernst Stavro Blofeld (Charles Gray, presumably (although never mentioned) to avenge the death of his wife, Bond finds him in a facility creating Blofeld lookalikes, he drowns the ""real"" Blofeld in a pool of superheated mud. Bond is told there is a worldwide plot where South African diamonds have been stolen from mines, several of those smuggling them are being killed one-by-one by homosexual assassins Mr. Wint (Bruce Glover) and Mr. Kidd (Putter Smith). Bond travels to Amsterdam, Holland, posing as diamond smuggler and assassin Peter Franks, to meet his contact, Tiffany Case (Jill St. John), the real Peter Franks (Joe Robinson) shows up, but Bond intercepts and kills him, and switches his ID making it seem that Franks is in fact Bond. The diamonds are smuggled into Los Angeles in Franks' corpse, Bond is met by CIA agent Felix Leiter (Norman Burton) before travelling to Los Angeles, where the diamonds are passed on to Shady Tree (Leonard Barr). Bond escapes an assassination by Wint and Kidd, placing him in a coffin for cremation, Tree stops the process are finding the diamonds were fake, planted by Bond and the CIA. Bond finds that Tree is a stand-up comedian working at hotel-casino The Whyte House, owned by reclusive billionaire Willard Whyte (Jimmy Dean), Tree is murdered by Wint and Kidd, they did not realise the diamonds were fake, Bond meanwhile is there and meets opportunistic Plenty O'Toole (Lana Wood) while gambling. Gang members get rid of Plenty and leave the room, where Bond spends the rest of the night with Tiffany, he instructs her to retrieve the real diamonds at Circus Circus casino, but she goes back on this arrangement and flees. Tiffany finds Plenty O'Toole is dead in her swimming pool, the assassins mistook her for Tiffany, the real diamonds are passed on to Albert R. 'Bert' Saxby (Bruce Cabot), Bond follows him to a facility, where he finds a laser satellite being built by laser refraction specialist Professor Doctor Metz (Joseph Fürst), Bond escapes when his cover is blown in a moon buggy and reunites with Tiffany. After evading arrest from the police, Bond leaves Tiffany to scale The Whyte House to confront Willard Whyte, he instead greeted by two identical Blofelds, they are using an electronic device to sound like Whyte, Bond kills one of the Blofelds, but finds it is his lookalike, he is then knocked out and left for dead by Wint and Kidd in a pipeline. Bond escapes and calls Blofeld, using a similar electronic device to sound like Saxby, to find out where the real Whyte is being held, Bond and the CIA infiltrate the location, find and rescue him, the real Saxby attempting an assassination is killed in the process. Bond and Whyte work out that a laser satellite has been built, the diamonds are being used to retract light and create a powerful blast, it is already in orbit, Blofeld destroys nuclear weapons in China, the Soviet Union and the United States, an international auction for global nuclear supremacy is proposed by Blofeld. Whyte identifies an oil platform off the coast of Baja California, not being part of his empire, as being Blofeld's base of operations, Bond fails in an attempt to change the cassette tape needed to control the satellite, with a mistake by Toiffany, but he does signal Leiter and the CIA to attack the rig. Blofeld attempts to escape in a midget submarine, but Bond uses it launch crane to crash it into the control room and destroy it, the end sees Bond and Tiffany on a cruise ship heading to Britain, Wint and Kidd pose as room service to attempt to kill them with a hidden bomb, but Bond kills them instead. Also starring Bernard Lee as M, Desmond Llewelyn as Q, Lois Maxwell as Moneypenny, Margaret Lacey as Mrs. Whistler, Lola Larson as Bambi, Trina Parks as Thumper, Laurence Naismith as Sir Donald Munger, David Bauer as Mr. Slumber, Ed Bishop as Klaus Hergersheimer, Shane Rimmer as Tom and Captain Scarlet's David Healy as Vandenburg Launch Director. Connery does alright but is not highly convincing as he was before being the suave and cool super spy, Gray as the only Blofeld with hair is good, and the gay hit men couple get their witty moments, this film is let down by a dull script, there are some good chase sequences and fight scenes, but accompanied by pathetic special effects it has many weak points, overall it is a naff but reasonably watchable spy adventure. It was nominated the Oscar for Best Sound. James Bond was number 3 on 100 Years, 100 Heroes & Villains, he was number 21 on The 100 Greatest Sex Symbols, and he was number 21 on The 100 Greatest Pop Culture Icons, Sir Sean Connery was number 8 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars, and he was number 3 on The 50 Greatest British Actors, and the film was number 2 on James Bond's Greatest Hits for the title song by Dame Shirley Bassey.

10,ccthemovieman-1,A Bond Movie That Fit The Sleazy Time Period,4,29 August 2007,"There is something unappealing about this James Bond movie. I think I've seen all of them and there are but a handful of them I would never watch twice. This is one of them. Some - like Goldfinger, The Spy Who Loved Me and others - I would happily watch many times.Despite having the normal amount of gadgets, pretty women, funny wise cracks, etc., this film seemed to drag in parts. Some of the earlier Bond movies are a bit slower than the ones in the past two decades, but not all. Maybe it's the time period this was made. I have found very few films in the first half of the 1970s that didn't look and sound sleazy to me. This felt that way, too.Jill St. John looked pretty hot in her day, but looking at her now as he looked then, I can't say that. Now she looks cheap with too much eye makeup, something actresses did a lot in the 1960s and early '70s.. I did like her name: ""Tiffany Case."" There wasn't much else to like.",Diamonds Are Forever
11,Tweekums,Connery is back!,7,28 August 2011,"After George Lazenby's single outing as James Bond Sean Connery is back again. Some people think this is one of the worst Bond films; I wouldn't go that far but it is certainly a lot more frivolous then previous instalments; there was always the occasional one liner but here they come thick and fast. In the pre-credit sequence. Bond tracks down and apparently kills Blofeld, who is now played by Charles Gray. With that case wrapped up he is set to work investigating diamonds being smuggled out of South Africa. His sent to Amsterdam where he poses as a known smuggler to get the diamonds of one Tiffany Chase. In order to find out who is organising the smuggling he then takes them to Los Angeles where he is met and taken to Las Vegas. Here he learns that they aren't being smuggled for financial reasons but to be used in a satellite based weapon will he be able to prevent it being used against Washington DC? As said before this is less serious then the previous films; I don't think it is bad though; in fact I've always rather enjoyed it. Charles Gray does a good job as arch-villain Blofeld but Putter Smith and Bruce Glover steal the show as Mr. Kidd and Mr. Wint; a pair of creepy killers who have a 'witty' line for every occasion. Jill St John does a fine job as Tiffany Case but the other 'Bond Girl' in this film, Lana Wood, who plays the appropriately named Plenty O'Toole, is rather under-used. The story is good enough although there are one or two plot holes for example Tiffany checks fingerprints to identify Bond as the smuggler but has no photograph of the real smuggler. As one would expect from a Bond film there are plenty of stunts, action and explosions. Over all I'd recommend this to other Bond fans even though it isn't a classic.",Diamonds Are Forever

The interesting screenplay based on Ian Fleming's novel is written by Richard Maibaum and the recently deceased Tom Mankiewicz. The action is very good , the cinematography by Ted Moore is magnificent , the sets decent , but the real clincher is the fact that Bond is once more performed by a hero with the right stuff .

The picture is produced by habituals Harry Saltzman and Albert R. Broccoli filmed on location in Amsterdam , Netherland , Los Angeles ,Nevada and Pinewood Studios ,London,England. The atmosphere is faithful to the actual location but the interiors on a set at Pinewood Studios.

13,BA_Harrison,Connery does camp.,7,13 October 2012,"Following George Lazenby's only performance as Bond in 1969's On Her Majesty's Secret Service, Sean Connery was lured back for one final (official) 007 caper, Diamonds Are Forever, in which he helped to establish the camp tone that Roger Moore would continue for his entire reign as Britain's best loved secret agent.However, although Connery's raw, no-nonsense style had long ago fallen by the wayside in favour of a more frivolous approach, seeing the series' original star tackle his character in such a light-hearted, self-mocking, comic-book manner is still very hard to take.The film's weak plot and mundane locations (most of the action takes place in the good old US of A) don't help matters much either, with the film lacklustre finale taking place not inside an extinct volcano, on a tropical island, under the sea, or in space, but on a rusty old oil platform off the coast of California. Booooring!Thankfully, Diamonds does benefit from a great collection of memorable villains, one particularly cool driving stunt, and some smashing Bond one-liners (my favourite: That's a nice little nothing you're almost wearing), all of which go to help make the film a reasonably acceptable romp overall (even though one can't help but think throughout that this outing would have been far better suited to Moore).6.5 out of 10, rounded up to 7 for the magnificent cleavage of Plenty O'Toole (Lana Wood).",Diamonds Are Forever
14,moonspinner55,"""I'm Plenty--Plenty O'Toole."" ... ""Named after your father, perhaps?""",8,9 October 2011,"Lusty, exciting, ingenious 007 yarn--one of the best in the James Bond franchise. After a one-picture absence, Sean Connery eases back into action as super-agent Bond with the gait of a hip lion in this dazzling adventure set mostly in Las Vegas, featuring great locations circa 1971 and a myriad of colorful villains. Blofeld returns (this time played by a somewhat more cavalier Charles Gray); he's after some diamonds to complete a space laser beam which can be used to decimate nuclear weaponry on Earth. Connery is older but no less in command, and he's paired very smartly with Jill St. John as Tiffany Case (in a lively performance) and Lana Wood as Plenty O'Toole (delicious eye candy who is unfortunately left expendable by the editing). A wonderfully sharp screenplay, several hair-raising fights (look out for Bambi and Thumper!), and a very tight direction by Guy Hamilton make this Bond hard to top. ***1/2 from ****",Diamonds Are Forever
15,edwagreen,Diamonds Are A Disaster *,2,15 February 2006,"Miserable James Bond thriller.What has happened to the cast? Sean Connery had really aged by 1971 when this film came out. Lois Maxwell, as Moneypenny, looked like she was ready to collect social security benefits and Bernard Lee,(M) looked as though he were in very poor health.The plot was confusing. There was diamond smuggling going on from the Union of South Africa to Holland. Along the way, a dentist, and a spinster teacher are bludgeoned to death. They belonged to the gang. The murder and mayhem is being done by 2 homosexuals who are openly gay. I didn't know that author Ian Fleming attended ""Brokeback Mountain"" way back.Jill St. John portrays a stupid redhead who is in with the smugglers but changes sides when she meets and falls for the dashing Bond. Of course, there are the usual car chases, explosions and a memorable fight scene in an elevator along the way.The ending might very well rile Conservatives. One of the homosexuals literally gets done in at his rear end and seems to enjoy it before the bomb goes off.Speaking of bombs, this is exactly what this film is.The main villain, Blofeld, comes in 3-there are 2 clones of him. 1 would have been more than sufficient in this failure of a picture.",Diamonds Are Forever
16,Coventry,Bond Vega$ Bond!,6,8 January 2016,"I wrote it before and I'll write it again, even the more lackluster James Bond movies are still definitely worth checking out! When the overall plot isn't particularly great or perhaps too far-fetched, like for example the case in ""Diamonds are Forever"", there are still various other reasons that make any particular 007 installment must- see material! Apart from the wonderful fact that Sean Connery returned one final time to play cinema's most legendary secret agent – officially at least – there are plenty of other fantastic elements in ""Diamonds are Forever"". The proficient Las Vegas filming locations, for starters, but even more so the uniquely tense & original sequences at the mortuary and a handful of truly offbeat but marvelous supportive characters; most notably a couple of queer but nefarious homosexuals killers, a strong female lead and a sexy duo of bikini-bodyguards named after cute Disney animals. And, come to think of it, the actual plot is more than thrilling and competent enough as well, it's just too bad about that clumsy and almost ridicule climax. After finally having settled an old score with his nemesis Blofeld, 007 is assigned to unravel a diamond smuggling network that stretches itself from South Africa over Holland and all the way to fabulous Las Vegas! Bond takes over the identity of a notorious runner after killing him and travels to the USA with the sexy female crook Tiffany Case. In Vegas, Bond gradually discovers that the contraband-diamonds serve a very peculiar purpose and that the recluse tycoon high up in his Vegas hotel is perhaps not that unknown The plot derails entirely in the last half hour, but at least until then ""Diamonds are Forever"" has been a very exhilarating and cool 007-adventure. It's particularly entertaining to witness how Bond's opponents insist to try and annihilate him via bizarre and convoluted tricks If they would just shoot a few bullets in head from close range, the franchise would have been finished since ""Dr. No"" already! I also don't want to blindly follow popular opinions, but Sean Connery truly is and forever will remain the greatest James Bond. He provides the character with a kind of self- parody that none of the other protagonists ever could accomplish. In this film, Connery also receives excellent support from a handful of multi-talented fellow cast members, like the stunningly beautiful ladies Jill St. John and Lana Wood (although the latter's role is sadly underdeveloped) and eccentric sidekick villains Putter Smith and Bruce Glover as the frolic duo Mr. Kidd and Mr. Wint. Even though I'm a big admirer of Charles Gray, he is most definitely a much weaker Blofeld than both Donald Pleasance and Telly Savalas. Horror and cult fanatics will also recognize the fantastic Sid Haig (""Spider Baby"", ""House of 1.000 Corpses"") in a small but memorable role as mortuary attendant.",Diamonds Are Forever

19,hitchcockthelegend,"Such a pity. All that time and energy wasted, simply to provide you with one mock, heroic moment.",6,17 May 2012,"Diamonds Are Forever is directed by Guy Hamilton and adapted to screenplay by Richard Maibaum and Tom Mankiewicz from the novel of the same name written by Ian Fleming. It stars Sean Connery, Jill St John, Charles Gray, Bruce Glover, Putter Smith, Joseph Furst, Norman Burton and Jimmy Dean. Music is scored by John Barry and cinematography by Ted Moore.Bond 7 and 007 is assigned to find out who is stock piling all the black market diamonds. This leads him to a sinister weapon being manufactured in space that can destroy major cities, the architect of such vileness? SPECTRE chief Ernst Stavro Blofeld, the man who murdered Bond's wife and someone Bond thought he had already located and killed.With George Lazenby withdrawing from the franchise after just the one film, off to massage his ego and take further bad advice from those around him, Albert R. Broccoli & Harry Saltzman set about making Bond sustainable box office in the 1970s. American actor John Gavin (Psycho/Spartacus) had signed on to fill the tuxedo, but armed with wads of cash the producers managed to entice Connery back to the role he had previously fell out of love with. Helped, too, that Connery's post Bond movies, his last outing had been You Only Live Twice in 1967, had hardly set the box office alight. It seemed a long shot, but Connery stunned the movie world by agreeing to once again play the role that many would come to know him for.Back came Connery, back came director Guy Hamilton and back came Shirley Bassey to sing the title song (a true Bond classic it proved to be as well), these were reassuring signs, as was having Blofeld remain on villain duties. However, stung by the criticism of Lazenby's humanesque On Her Majesty's Secret Service, and the drop in box office profits compared to Connery's latter Bond films, the makers decided to play this Bond as fantastique, something that would define Bond until Timothy Dalton tried something different at the end of the 1980s. Roger Moore would replace Connery as Bond two years later and it's widely thought that his arrival as 007 ushered in the ""ridiculous"" era of overt humour, preposterous sight gags and cartoonish escapades, not so, it began with Connery's Diamonds Are Forever. The moment Bond drives a Ford Mustang on two wheels, all bets were off in the franchise.Artistically ""Diamonds"" is a disappointing movie, fun for sure, but the screenplay refuses to let the film take itself seriously. It's often camp and the picture lacks dramatic thrust and spectacular action, with the finale a rather tepid affair. Connery's presence gives the film some warmth, but his charisma and vocal delivery can't detract from the fact he looks to be doing it purely for the money. His weight, like his hair colour, fluctuates, and much of the vibrancy of his 60s Bond portrayals had disappeared. Charles Gray turns in the worst Blofeld of them all, saddled with a screenplay that has him cloning and cross dressing, Gray has Blofeld as charming and wry, gone is the menace and machismo so wonderfully portrayed by Pleasence and Savalas respectively in the previous two Bond movies. Felix Leiter in Norman Burton's hands has been reduced to being a bit of a doofus, the baddies are either too fey or over the top, while Jill St John's main Bond girl, Tiffany Case, descends from being a steely femme at the beginning, to a voluptuous caricature.On the plus side. Barry's score and Ken Adam's sets are still franchise joys, the byplay between Bond and M (Bernard Lee again) reminds us of once great characterisations, while Desmond Llewelyn's Q is nicely sent out in the field for a change. Action wise there's some fine moments. The pre-credits sequence as Bond chases down Blofeld starts things off excitingly, a fight in a lift is up with the best of the Bond movie dust-ups and the dirt bike and Mustang chase sequences are well put together by Hamilton. Good gadgets, too, if you like that side of Bond? There was enough good parts here, and the return of Connery, to ensure Diamonds Are Forever was a monster success at the box office, where it grossed over $115 million worldwide. It proved that Bond had longevity, but with a new actor to come to the Bond role in two years time and the big shift to comedy action over tough guy missions, would Bond turn off the movie loving public? 6/10",Diamonds Are Forever
20,Theo Robertson,Connery`s Worst Bond Outing,5,29 January 2003,"For many people James Bond is Sean Connery but that doesn`t mean a Bond film is an instant classic because Connery is in it . DIAMONDS ARE FOREVER is barely watchable enough , just think how bad it could have been without Big Sean
***** SPOILERS ******What I hate about this film is there is no internal continuity with OHMSS . Blofeld killed Bond`s wife in the previous movie and it starts with Bond on the revenge trail where Bond apparently kills Blofeld in the pre title sequence , but as the film continues and it`s revealed Blofeld isn`t really dead all that`s gone before is quickly forgotten about as if it never happened in the first place . If they were going to ignore all this then why couldn`t the producers just kill off Blofeld  and introduce another meglomanaic villain . Like wise Charles Gray`s performance is totally unconvincing , can you imagine Donald Plesance from YOU ONLY LIVE TWICE appearing in drag smoking a cigarette from a holder in an entirely camp manner ?The production values are also very poor . The script resembles one of the latter Moore films where lots of things may happen but serves to disguise the fact that there is nothing happening plot wise . Are Blofeld`s henchman SPECTRE ? If so it`s never mentioned on screen and I found their garish uniforms of pale blue jumpsuits and red helmets both irritating and laughable . Jill St John plays one of the most forgettable Bond girls and director Guy Hamilton has a real bad off day especially during the action climax featuring the superimposed explosions of helicoptersThere are a couple of good points about DIAMONDS ARE FOREVER which stop it from being a contender for worst Bond film . There is the welcome return of Connery in the lead and I couldn`t help but enjoy the inclusion of a couple of gay hitmen , the scene where one of them is dispatched with a bomb between his legs still brings a wry smile to my face though Bond`s wise crack after this causes me to groan out loud",Diamonds Are Forever

24,zardoz-13,Sean Connery Returns Officially as 007,9,8 March 2009,"The seventh James Bond movie, director Guy Hamilton's ""Diamonds Are Forever,"" doesn't top Hamilton's earlier 007 outing ""Goldfinger."" Nevertheless, it easily surpasses ""Live and Let Die"" and ""The Man with the Golden Gun."" This time Bond discovers Ernst Stavro Blofeld has almost as many lives as his white cat. Blofeld's global criminal syndicate has been stockpiling diamonds and the Prime Minister wants British Intelligence to investigate. Of course, 007 has no idea Blofeld is behind the diamond smuggling ring because he iced the arch-villain in the entertaining pre-credit sequence which marked the return of Sean Connery after the debacle of ""On Her Majesty's Secret Service"" and one-time only Bond George Lazenby.United Artists had given Lazenby the boot, while Saltzman & Broccoli induced a paunchy Sean Connery to assay the role once more after he'd quit the series following ""You Only Live Twice."" Indeed, everybody was concerned that the serious-minded but perhaps best Bond of all time—""On Her Majesty's Secret Service"" had failed to attract audiences. They feared meant 007 might have lost his license to entertain. ""Diamonds Are Forever"" proved the cynics wrong as the franchise rebounded, but Connery didn't bounce back for ""Live and Let Die."" Connery abandoned Bondage again, later to return in ""Never Say Never Again"" in 1983. Speaking of returns, actor Charles Gray who had appeared in ""You Only Live Twice"" as a British contact returned, but this time he played a foppish Blofeld in a khaki-type uniform jacket, smoking a cigarette in a holder.Indeed, many things about ""Diamonds Are Forever"" resemble Guy Hamilton's ""Goldfinger."" The laser that nearly emasculated 007 turns into a larger laser with enough power to destroy submarines, missile silos, and above-ground missile launchers. ""Diamonds"" departs from the formula by having Bond and M discuss 007's latest mission with Sir Donald at the diamond ministry. This single scene after the title credits dovetails what might have been two scenes, the usual one in M's office and later in Sir Donald's office, into one scene. Hamilton had two scenes in ""Goldfinger"" where Bond received his assignment and then met with M and the Treasury people about gold. In ""Goldfinger,"" the villains held Bond hostage for most of the picture, but in ""Diamonds"" he spends most of his time undercover as a member of Blofeld's syndicate, helping smuggle the diamonds into America. Unlike ""Goldfinger,"" Q Branch provided Bond with no gadgets, but Q shows up briefly in the Las Vegas scene to equip Bond with a voice altering device like Blofeld had that enables him to masquerade as the world's richest hermit, Willard Whyte.Briefly, the British are worried somebody is stockpiling diamonds either to depress prices or perhaps blackmail the British. British Intelligence has traced a suspect, Peter Franks (Joe Robinson), who is going to a rendezvous in Amsterdam with Ms. Tiffany Case (Jill St. John of ""Tony Rome"") who may have more clues about the case. British Intelligence arrests Franks and Bond impersonates him, meets with Ms. Case, learns he is about to earn his $50-thousand by smuggling a chandelier of diamonds into America. Meanwhile, Blofeld has dispatched two homosexual hit men, Mr. Kidd (Putter Smith) and Mr. Wint (Bruce Glover of ""Walking Tall""), to tidy up things by eliminating the people in the pipeline so nobody can trace them back to Blofeld. Franks escapes from his captors, reaches Amsterdam, and dies in a savage elevator slugfest with Bond who then swaps wallets with Franks. Tiffany searches Franks, covered in foam from a fire extinguisher, and looks shocked when she glimpses his Playboy membership card. Appropriately shocked, Tiffany exclaims, ""My God, you've just killed James Bond!"" Bond chuckles, ""It just proves no one's indestructible."" ""You don't kill James Bond,"" Tiffany reprimands him, ""and sit around waiting for the cops to arrive."" 007 conceals the diamonds in Franks' body and Ms. Case and he fly into Los Angeles with Mr. Kidd and Mr. Wint on the same airplane shadowing their every move. Felix Leiter, posing as a customs official, meets Bond at LAX and watches while some mobsters load Franks' casket with the diamonds into a hearse. Bond rides with them to Las Vegas where the body is to be cremated. The funeral home removes the diamonds and puts them in an urn for 007 to leave for the next member of the pipeline. Wint and Kidd bash 007 over the head, stick him in a casket and send him off to be incinerated. Comedian Shady Tree and the funeral home director rescue Bond moments before being immolated and curse him for leaving them with phony diamonds. Bond goes to Las Vegas, soaks in a tub at a casino motel, and awaits the arrival of Q and the diamonds.After the diamonds reach America and go to Willard Whyte's research labs, ""Diamonds"" seems more like an adaptation of ""Dr. No"" and ""You Only Live Twice."" Bond receives the surprise of his life when he discovers that not only is Blofeld alive but also that the criminal mastermind has doubles everywhere with duplicate cats. Eventually, Bond rescues the real Willard Whyte (country and western crooner Jimmy Dean) who Blofeld has held hostage. Blofeld used an ingenious device that makes his voice sound precisely like Whyte's voice. Blofeld has taken over Whyte's global network and holds the man hostage. Since nobody has seen Whyte for five years—the character resembles Howard Hughes—he makes the perfect kidnap hostage. Eventually, Blofeld is able to launch a satellite with a laser and threatens to destroy an American city if Washington, D.C., doesn't cough up bucks galore. As for the serious tone of the previous Bond, the writers decided to make ""Diamonds"" much more tongue-in-cheek, almost to point of parody. Bond destroys Blofeld's newest base on an oil drilling platform and disables the laser satellite. But does he really kill Blofeld? You'll have to watch ""For Your Eyes Only"" to know.",Diamonds Are Forever

The movie uses all the typical Bond ingredients but is still original enough and has a couple of memorable scene's and some great characters. Especially Mr. Wint (Bruce Glover) and Mr. Kidd (Putter Smith) are very memorable as both assassins as well as lovers. They are a great screen couple and even the fact that Putter Smith can't act doesn't ruin that.Funny thing about ""Diamonds Are Forever"" is that it's a typical Roger Moore Bond even though Sean Connery plays Bond in this one. The humor is very similar to the later Roger Moore Bonds and Sean Connery certainly portrays the most fun Bond out of his career.Then the most important thing: The Bond girl.

One would have wonder exactly WHICH ""fulsome friend"" Ms. St. John is lamenting. Two of the likely candidates are ""Marie"" and ""Plenty."" Neither character is on-screen long enough to even qualify for MLB's proverbial ""cup of coffee."" Bond rips off Marie's bikini top and garrotes her with it. Since the uncredited Denise Perrier, who played Marie, was not as famous as Ms. St. John, her chest points are clearly visible during this violent episode (1:44) and NOT modestly covered by pasties, as is the case when Bond beds Tiffany (1:08:30). This psychopathic sex-killing set-up (even if not carried to an ultimate conclusion) clearly inspired director Alfred Hitchcock's only topless scene the following year in FRENZY. (As a fellow Brit, Hitchcock was insanely jealous of Bond's glory and box office, churning out pale imitations such as TOPAZ and TORN CURTAIN in his declining years.) On the other hand, actress Lana Wood, as DIAMONDS' ""Plenty O'Toole,"" suffers from benign neglect. Miss O'Toole spends plenty of her brief on-screen time during this film in swimming pools, being ""doubled"" by stunt-women and\or dummies. While ""Plenty"" may be more ""fulsome"" than ""Marie,"" neither woman is likely to keep ""Tiffany"" awake at night.

We also have a couple of devious nerds called Mr. Wint and Mr. Kidd who are involved in a defeat so stupid that it warrants ridicule.

Here Bond is nearly killed several times including cremation and buried alive in a pipe line but he makes a getaway in a moon buggy. Jill St. John is easily the worst and most annoying Bond girl at this point.

This one's entertaining throughout, but it introduced a silly, cartoonish element more glaring than anything up to this point. Then there's the fact that the storyline is almost impossible to follow unlike the previous installments which were easy to grasp, like ""Dr. No,"" ""Goldfinger,"" ""Thunderball"" and ""On Her Majesty's Secret Service."" You just have to kick back and enjoy the madness of it all.Beautiful Lana Wood stands out on the female front, but her role is too brief (her apparel too, lol). Meanwhile Jill St. John is lots of fun, not to mention alluring.Needless to say, Vegas makes for a great setting for a James Bond flick. There are neon lights, highrise hotels, casinos, swimming pools, deserts, circuses, showgirls, tourists and thrills galore.The film runs 2 hours and was shot in Las Vegas & the Nevada desert; Netherlands; Pinewood Studios near London; Palm Springs, Ca (Willard Whyte's Desert House); French Riviera, France (pre-credits sequence); and the Pacific Ocean.GRADE: B-",Diamonds Are Forever

34,deloudelouvain,Not that good.,5,8 July 2021,"I've been watching (sometiimes rewatching) the James Bond movies in chronological order. After a one time appearance of George Lazenby as James Bond it's back to Sean Connery. Sean Connery has more charisma to play double O seven but to be fair this wasn't his best James Bond movie. There are a lot of mediocre actors in Diamonds Are Forever, the story should be easy to follow but it actually isn't. Where are the diamonds? , who took them? , why did they take them? , it's all little things that make almost no sense and that bring down the movie. The action scenes are most of the time boring, even for 1971. To me it's one of the weaker movies in the James Bond saga. In the hope the next one will be better. Next: To Live And Let Die.",Diamonds Are Forever
35,SimonJack,A slower Connery and screenplay for the Bond series,6,8 April 2018,"""Diamonds are Forever"" is the seventh in the James Bond series of films, and the sixth for Sean Connery in the lead role. Connery was brought back two years after the producers tried an unsuccessful replacement with George Lazenby in 1969. The public didn't take to Lazenby. ""On Her Majesty's Secret Service"" did okay at the box office, but well below the expected showing for a James Bond film. So, the studio heads hoped to revive the series with Connery's return. This film two years later fared just a little better. But, it also showed that Connery's Bond had changed. Connery was 31 when the series premiered in 1962 with ""Dr. No."" Nine years later, he clearly shows his age. For a dashing James Bond, Connery has slowed way down. A number of telltale things in his film point to the need for a younger replacement. Bond doesn't have near the normal physical challenges in this film. He's just so-so in a brawling scene, and he has a scene in which two martial arts girls utterly do him in. Thumper and Marie have some acrobatic skill but they are very slow and amateurish with their martial arts. And, Bond is even slower to react. This clearly is not the James Bond that everyone knew and enjoyed from the 1960s. There is some good gadgetry in this film, but little introduction to it by Q. The plot doesn't seem as beguiling either. The character of Willard Whyte is clearly based on Howard Hughes, and the location of much of the film around Las Vegas doesn't do anything to life this film. The variety of exotic locations is absent here. The Netherlands, London, Los Angeles and the Nevada scenes hardly add to the allure of the Bond legend. Finally, Connery seems tired in his role. The script is missing the zip and witty quips that pepper most Bond films. About the only real satisfying part of the film is the justice in the demise of the two unsavory characters who are supposed to be Bond's nemesis. Mr. Kidd and Mr. Wint meet their end in typically strange and unusual ways. It's a strain to rate this film six stars, but the usual superb job of showing highly technical wares deserves the credit for this. That, and the overall production qualities of the film, which speak well for the series continuing in the future.The best line in the movie is from Jill St. John as Tiffany Case. After she and Bond are put under guard by Felix Leiter of the CIA, she says, ""Well, that's a switch."" Bond says, ""What's that,"" and Case replies, ""The wolf being guarded by the three little pigs.""",Diamonds Are Forever

37,ShadeGrenade,"Welcome to the 70's, Mr.Bond!",8,9 May 2012,"One of the most frequently quoted statistics concerning 'Diamonds Are Forever' is that it was outperformed in the U.K. in 1971 by the feature film version of 'On The Buses'. This is in fact untrue. 'Forever' premiered in London on 30 December; it did not go on general release until the following day when it went on to outperform every other film in Britain in 1972. But I digress; the seventh 007 epic saw a brief return to the role for Sean Connery, who'd vacated Bond's shoes for 'On Her Majesty's Secret Service' ( 1969 ), now ( rightly ) regarded as one of the all-time great Bond films, but at the time it was deemed to have been a failure. David Picker, head of United Artists, lured the recalcitrant actor back with the offer of a huge pay cheque and the promise of funding for three movies of his choice. The new decade saw a change in style for the Bond movies. The 60's ones were tongue-in-cheek but mock-serious. The only one to adopt a lighter tone was 'Goldfinger' ( 1964 ). It was to recapture that tone that producers Cubby Broccoli and Harry Saltzman brought back director Guy Hamilton. This is no more apparent than in the scene in Slumber's Funeral Parlour - 'Morton Slumber' ( the late David Bauer ) could have wandered out of an episode of 'The Avengers'. The Fleming novel had Bond going undercover ( impersonating one 'Peter Franks', whom British Intelligence have captured ) to infiltrate a gang of diamond smugglers, one of whom is the beautiful 'Tiffany Case'. Much action is centred around Las Vegas. Tom Mankiewicz and Richard Maibaum's script retained the early part of the novel, but then deviated from it with 'Ernst Stavro Blofeld' ( Charles Gray ) yet again planning to hold the world to ransom, this time with a laser-satellite ( full of diamonds ) orbiting the Earth.Connery gives one of his best performances as Bond, certainly better than the one he gave in 'You Only Live Twice' in which he was virtually on auto-pilot throughout. No wonder audiences cheered when he once again said that famous line "" My name is Bond...James Bond!"". Charles Gray makes for an elegantly caddish 'Blofeld', delivering wry quips through cigarette smoke like an evil Noel Coward. Before anyone says 'Blofeld should not be British!', look at it this way - would not a man on the run from the intelligence services try to throw them off the scent in some imaginative way? Pretending to be another nationality makes perfect sense. The pre-credits sequence has Bond hunting the world for Blofeld ( presumably to get revenge for wife Tracy's death, its never made clear ). In South America, he finds him experimenting with clones. After a fight, Blofeld is sent hurtling face-first into a mud pool, but of course, it isn't really him. Maurice Binder's title sequence kicks in to the welcome return of Shirley Bassey's vocals.'Forever' features Bond's first gay characters ( not counting 'Rosa Klebb' ) in the shape of killers 'Mr.Kidd' ( Putter Smith ) and 'Mr.Wint' ( Bruce Glover ), while 'Tiffany' ( the stunning Jill St.John ) is far more brash than previous Bond girls. Lana Wood shines briefly as the ill-fated 'Plenty O'Toole'. Those who dismiss the Roger Moore era for its wacky humour need to realise that the trend towards self parody in fact began here. The action sequences are a mixed bag; the fight in the lift between Bond and Peter Franks ( Joe Robinson ) is one of the very best to grace a 007 film, ditto the bruising encounter with 'Bambi' ( Lola Larson ) and 'Thumper' ( Trina Parks ), the moon buggy chase and Les Vegas car chase stunning ( remember Bond's car being driven on two wheels? ), but best of all is the scene where Bond ascends the Whyte House to break into reclusive millionaire Willard Whyte ( Jimmy Dean )'s sumptuous apartment. Some gorgeous sets by Ken Adam here. John Barry's score is one of his best ( my favourite track is '007 & Counting', heard as Blofeld's satellite goes about the globe causing havoc ). On the down side, the final helicopter assault on Blofeld's oil rig headquarters is flat and uninspired, like something out of a made-for-television film.'Forever' is far from being classic Bond, but manages to be watchable and has some wonderful moments; for instance, when 'Felix Leiter' ( Normann Burton ) asks Bond where on Franks' corpse the diamonds have been hidden, he gets the reply: ""Alimentary, Dr.Leiter!"". It silenced critics who had claimed that Bond was washed-up and set the standard for the Moore 007 movies to follow. Connery would play the role only one more time, in 1983's 'Never Say Never Again'.",Diamonds Are Forever
38,JamesHitchcock,Not one of the Bond classics,6,1 March 2013,"After George Lazenby left the franchise, possibly jumping before he was pushed, there was much speculation about who would play the role in the next Bond film. In the end, however, Sean Connery was persuaded to return for a sixth outing as 007, although he does not seem to have enjoyed the experience. He is alleged to have stated that he would ""never again"" play James Bond- hence the title of the unofficial Bond film from twelve years later in which he played the role for the seventh and final time. James Bond is ordered by his boss, M, to investigate a diamond smuggling ring. M suspects that stolen diamonds are being stockpiled to depress the market, but the truth is far more sinister. SPECTRE, the international terrorist organisation featured in a number of earlier Bond movies, wants to diamonds to power an enormous satellite-mounted laser weapon with which they hope to hold the world's governments to ransom. (This plot was, essentially, to be reused in a later Bond film, ""Die Another Day""). This was, in fact, the last film in the official series to feature SPECTRE, for reasons connected with the settlement of a lawsuit about the film rights to Ian Fleming's novels. As in the two previous Bonds, ""You Only Live Twice"" and ""OHMSS"", the main villain is Ernst Stavro Blofeld, the head of SPECTRE. Blofeld was played by a different actor in each film, Donald Pleasance, Telly Savalas and here Charles Gray, who had played a Bond ally in ""You Only Live Twice"". Savalas had played the character as a crude American gangster, despite his rather incongruous obsession with proving himself a European Count, but Gray's interpretation is closer to Pleasance's, suave, superficially gentlemanly and cat-loving, but sinister. Both Pleasance and Gray give Blofeld an upper-class British accent, although according to Fleming he is half-Greek, half-Polish. The main ""Bond Girl"" here is Jill St. John's Tiffany Case. (Jill was both the first American and the first red-headed Bond Girl). Like a number of Bond heroines, Tiffany is originally an associate of the villains who switches sides, possibly when she realises that Blofeld has a nasty habit of killing off his own accomplices, presumably in order to cover his tracks. I know that Jill has come in for some criticism, but Tiffany is one of my favourite Bond Girls. Tough, feisty and resourceful, she was presumably created to be as different as possible from the doomed, tragic Tracy in ""OHMSS"". A strong villain and a strong heroine are normally two important factors in the success of any Bond film. Yet despite my liking for both Gray and St. John, my view is that ""Diamonds Are Forever"" is far from the best of the series. Bringing back Connery was probably not the best idea that Harry Saltzman and Albert Broccoli ever had, because, although he is certainly an improvement on the inert Lazenby, this is his weakest performance in the series. He seems to have been more fixated on his million-and-a-quarter dollar fee than he was with playing his part, and looks bored and disillusioned. Some of the minor members of the cast are not really up to scratch; Lana Wood, sister of the more famous and more talented Natalie, shows just why she never went on to become a major star like her elder sibling. (Her character's name, Plenty O'Toole, must count as the second-most contrived moniker for a Bond Girl after Pussy Galore). Naming two ruthless female assassins ""Bambi"" and ""Thumper"" may have been intended as irony, but their names seem to be unfortunately, and doubtless unintentionally, appropriate; Lola Larson and Trina Parks come across as no more threatening than the lovable Disney cartoon characters whose names they bear. The gay hit men Mr. Wint and Mr. Kidd may have seemed amusing in 1971, but in 2013 they just seem embarrassing. (At least, they were gay in Fleming's novel; in the movie, to keep the censors happy, their homosexuality is implied but never expressly stated). The plot has some similarities with that of ""Goldfinger""- the two films also had the same director, Guy Hamilton- but is a bafflingly complex one, far more complex than it needs to be, and is often difficult to follow. Although short sequences near the beginning are set in South Africa or Amsterdam, the film's main location, Las Vegas, lacks the glamorous exoticism often associated with Bond movies. Apart from an exciting car chase through the streets of Vegas there are few thrilling action sequences, and the final scenes (set on an oil rig) are less spectacular than many Bond finales. Gray, St John and Shirley Bassey's great theme song mean that ""Diamonds Are Forever"" gets one star more than its lacklustre predecessor, but for me it will never be one of the Bond classics, certainly not in the same class as ""Goldfinger"" or ""You Only Live Twice"". 6/10",Diamonds Are Forever

40,DKosty123,Most Humor Of The Sean Connery Ones,7,15 June 2010,"This film was released after the George Lazenby's disaster ""His Majesty's Secret Service"" which seemed to prove that you needed at least a good actor to play Bond. Sean Connery got lots of extra money to come back for one more round, but less physical strain than most of the earlier efforts.With the recent death of 82 year old Jimmy Dean (Willard Whyte), we must be reminded that Sean Connery is 80, Jill St John looks plenty cheeky in this one is 70, and Lana Wood is 64 as I write this. When you watch this movie, it doesn't seem possible. Still this is a good film to watch. This is a very rare movie role for Dean, as most of his work was recording (Big Bad John) & TV's The Jimmy Dean Show. Dean's character is kind of a ruse looking to be the bad guy.This film features all the regulars from the series for Connery's last trip with them. Then there are things like a bit part for Leonard Barr, & the first apparently gay bad guys trying to do in Bond. Then besides the 2 hot main Bond women, we have Bambi & Thumper, a couple of exercises for Connery.Blofeld (Charles Gray in this one) has taken over millionaire Willard Whytes empire by kidnapping him & then using a voice mocking tool to run his empire. He sets up some new parts of the Empire involved in stealing Diamonds which he places into a satellite to put into orbit. This is where he is using solar energy to heat up the glass to create a super weapon energy beam with a purpose of destroying parts of the earth.This film has quite a bit of old Las Vegas in it, & there is a touch of nostalgia here as the good guys & bad guys seem well defined. The big clue to a lot of this has to do with cheap cologne. This film's added humor along with Connery is welcome relief after the previous film & actually paves the road well to lead into Roger Moore's more humorous Bond films to follow.",Diamonds Are Forever
41,Red-Barracuda,A very mediocre entry in the Bond series,6,1 April 2011,"Sean Connery returned to the James Bond role after a one movie hiatus. The fact that the gap was filled by On Her Majesty's Secret Service only emphasizes even more how lacking Diamond's Are Forever actually is. OHMSS is unquestionably one of the best films in the series with an ending that is incredibly bleak. It's definitely the bravest entry in the franchise. From the word go, it's follow up Diamonds Are Forever is strictly back to business as usual. We begin in an underground hideout sequence with Bond fighting Blofeld. It's silly beyond words, and from here the film alternates between being ridiculous and borderline tedious. Why is this? Well, for one thing, Connery seems to clearly just be in it for the money now. He is playing a role you know he can't be bothered with anymore and turns in a performance that is strictly by the numbers. He's not even in very good shape which adds to the over all lacking quality in his screen presence. But the film as a whole is very underwhelming. The plot line seemed to me to be all over the place; we began with diamonds and somehow ended with deadly outer-space laser weapons. And I can't say I'm sure how we got from one plot point to the other. None of this would matter of course if the film was otherwise loaded with the usual thrills and glamour. But in all honesty there are only small moments here that are memorable – the lift fight and the Vegas car-chase for example. At other times the overall whole is undermined by a definite smirking to camera approach where it's almost played as a comedy – this would go on to be a feature of the rest of the 70's films with Roger Moore in the main role. Although Moore is far better suited to comedy, so it works a bit better in his movies on the whole. While the film does have interesting characters in the gay hit men, it also has an nonthreatening Blofeld, a lightweight Bond girl and the faintly ridiculous – if admittedly memorable Bambi and Thumper.Ultimately, Diamonds Are Forever gets too much wrong, and is only a very average film. It may have been set in Vegas but it's roll of the dice hasn't produced a winner.",Diamonds Are Forever
42,KineticSeoul,It's like a parody of itself,4,31 January 2016,"This is the 7th installment in the Bond franchise and it is the most campy Bond movie compared to the previous one. The whole premise and direction was just plain out silly. Of course the Bond movies in the 60's, 70 and even the 80's are iconic for having those classic campy moments. But this one was silly while also being very forgettable. It can be debatable but it's probably the most misogynistic ""007"" movie compared to the previous installment. It's like they thought the more of the previous Bond movies would equal better...Well that wasn't the case. After Sean Connery taking the lead role as James Bond again after leaving the role because of payment issue. The people involved in the filming probably thought ""Oh we have Sean Connery, that is all we need"". So they probably thought Sean Connery or one actor they wanted can save the franchise. And that shows, because there didn't seem to have cared much about carrying on the essence of the classic James Bond movies or coming up with a coherent story. The whole movie seemed like a parody of itself, instead of it being a cool 70's super spy movie. It goes from Bond's arch-nemesis gets slammed head first into hot mud while on a operating table to stealing a moon buggy to fighting off chicks called Bambi and Thumper that do acrobatic moves. To the stereotypical villains giving away their whole plan to the spy. Overall if you are a Bond fan it might be worth a watch, but it's easily a forgettable Bond movie that has Sean Connery.4.5/10",Diamonds Are Forever
43,OllieSuave-007,Pretty funny last Sean Connery entry.,8,28 October 2013,"This is a pretty funny 007 film starring Sean Connery as his last outing as James Bond in the original continuity (not counting the Thunderball remake Never Say Never Again). Bond gets involved in a diamond smuggling investigation in Las Vegas, where he uncovers an extortion plot headed by his number one enemy, Ernst Stavro Blofeld.Unlike earlier Bond films, you get to see Bond deal more one-on-one with Blofeld. There are more, if I remember, comedy in this entry than earlier films, particularly in that of Bond girl Tiffany Case (Jill St. John). I actually thought Case did a good job in her role; she was very funny and entertaining. There are also plenty of other Bond girls including that of Bambi and Thumper.Bond did his usual one-liners and Licensed to Kill action in this film, but it was evident that Connery was done with the role. While many Bond films tend to drag on the plot a little, this one was pretty fast-paced and entertaining for me and I thought it closes out the Connery saga pretty well.Grade B+",Diamonds Are Forever
44,thesar-2,In the Rough Diamond,3,3 March 2013,"When the first thing that pops in my mind when thinking of a way to construct my review of Diamonds Are Forever is: Well, thank God, we've finally hit the 70'syou know there's trouble.My continuing voyage through the Bond Galaxy reaches Bond Part VII, and boy, did it start off with a bang: Bond kills Blofeld! Easily and clumsily, as usual, but still he did in 5 minutes what he couldn't for a few movies before this. Naturally, he's getting revenge as the previous chapter ended on a ""sad"" note with Blofeld killing Bond's one and only wife.Also as usual: Bond's out for revenge – no convincing me otherwise, and of course, Sean Conner's smirking demeanor never changes. He's neither satisfied, nor happy, nor angry, nor ecstatic. He's just smirking away, like he's done floating through now six of the seven Bond franchises. In fact, the only thing that has changed is that Connery looks like he's aged a bunch since two movies back: You Only Live Twice and that was only four years prior.I digress. This movie started off promising with action, the best desert chase scene since Eegah, a decent idea and song, a rare secret identity for Bond and hell, it was even long before it's time by including an obviously gay duo, albeit evil and bumbling, but still. And the cherry on top: we got a somewhat decent Las Vegas of the early 1970s chase scene, including driving up and down the currently closed Fremont Street. (I use ""somewhat decent chase scene"" because it's few and far between that Bond movies really imagine or show an inventive chase sequence.)And then.the movie literally went to sh|t. No joke. This movie fell off the same cliffs Bond skied off of in the previous movie, On Her Majesty's Secret Service.Oh, I forgot about the main plot. Undercover Bond (mercifully not with a kilt or puffy shirt this time) is involved in diamond smuggling into Clark County, NV. That's here nor there, because they end up on an oil station on the ocean and Godzilla-type special effects are the main focus and whoathey were bad.Thankfully, that was the finale, so it really couldn't get much worse. But, from starting off good, and continuing to some interesting scenes – such as a fairly good high up, outdoor elevator scene, it really went to hell in the second half and if you feel like finishing this, you'll have a cartoonishly bad time.Oh, when will this series get cool? Become fun and adventurous? Will it, relatively soon? Yeah, I'm a modern Bond fan – the first third or so films were before I was even conceived, but come on. On the flip side, I do believe what ain't broke, don't fixand that makes me feel pity on the lowest of expectations of audiences back in the 1960s-1970s.Hopefully, the next film will let the good live and let the cheese die. Hopefully.(This is my Bondathon series leading up to 2012's James Bond Part XXIII: Skyfall. I will be including the ""odd one out"": Never Say Never Again just to get the whole experience. That said, I am skipping both the 50-minute Made-for-TV film and the original spoof, 1967's Casino Royale because...I still have some dignity.)",Diamonds Are Forever

The flaws here are too numerous to list: incoherent, illogical script (you can watch this film 100 times and still not be able to follow the story), unexciting car chases, total lack of tension and urgency, Connery in his most bored and by-the-numbers performance as 007, one of the dumbest Bond Girls ever (though she begins as smart), and so on. The redeeming virtues are few: the brutal and realistic fistfight in the elevator, the memorable (and sexy) encounter with ""Bambi"" and ""Thumper"", the sometimes-funny quips of the ""Mr. Wint-Mr. Kidd"" team, Charles Gray's amusing (if not imposing) performance as Blofeld.

47,Lejink,Viva Las Bondas,7,18 November 2010,"This was the first Bond film I ever saw, when I was about 10 or 11 and I still remember it fondly, as much for the merchandising as anything - yes I got my toy moon buggy and tri-bike, no doubt like millions of other young kids of the time.Looked at today, it palls somewhat, let down, ironically, by the franchise's growing addiction to gimmicky hardware and SFX set-pieces, which helps explain why this was effectively Connery's last hurrah in the character. Indeed, it's about the only one of his first six Bond parts you can visualise Roger ""eyebrows"" Moore in, as he gets little to do other than make smart one-liners, bed the female talent and man the afore-mentioned contraptions. He just about pulls it off, but you can see him going through the motions at times.The movie's outlook towards women too, like Bond's, is anachronistic, I'm struggling to remember a scene where a woman is fully dressed, plus some of Bond's chauvinistic quips ""I'm plenty""...""But of course you are"" seem more at home in a ""Carry On"" film. The plotting also seems too similar to say, ""You Only Live Twice"", plus I also think the Mr Kidd & Mr Wint characters would have worked better without their campish gay overtones.On the plus side though, Jill St John gives her cardboard character some presence, Charles Gray is an effective Blofeld (in triplicate), I enjoyed Jimmy Dean's take on ""Howard Hughes"" a la Willard Whyte, the Vegas locations are great, John Barry's music adds lustre (ouch!) and, I've got to confess, some of the big scenes still entertain, from the great fight in the confined space of a lift compartment, to the moon buggy escape, naturally the car park chase in downtown Las Vegas with THAT two-wheeled side-on stunt, the fight with Thumper and Bambi and the reckoning with Kidd & Wint as a postscript.I enjoyed the movie but fear that nostalgia was clouding my critical faculties throughout, however as so many have done before, perhaps best to surrender to Bond and go with the flow.",Diamonds Are Forever
48,bowmanblue,The first Roger Moore Bond film (without Roger Moore though),7,31 October 2014,"I'll start with a fact: most serious Bond fans HATE Diamonds Are Forever. I used to watch it when it was on TV in the eighties (when I was a child) and I loved it. Nowadays, I guess I can see where people are coming from. It is a bit of an odd-one-out among the franchise.Sean Connery returns as Bond (after the unsuccessful George Lazenby took over the titular role for a single outing). Now he's older. And it shows. Plus it doesn't really carry on from On Her Majesty's Secret Service; it feels like it's more a continuation of Connery's last Bond film, You Only Live Twice. Also, due to Lazenby's Bond not being financially profitable in American, Diamonds Are Forever is conveniently sent almost completely in the USA (including the first ever American Bond girl). Also, to add a few more pennies to the film's takings, we have plenty of product placement throughout. Therefore, Diamonds Are Forever seems to have its share of oddities before you even get to the plot.Bond chases diamonds to America and ends up getting tangled up with his arch enemy Blofeld (again). There's not much to the story, but that doesn't matter too much as it flows along nicely. However, one criticism that was always applied to Roger Moore's Bond films was that they couldn't be taken seriously. People seem to prefer Connery's more serious outings. However, almost every line has a - naughty - double meaning to it and some of the situations do border on the comical.Then, just when you think you're in a smutty comedy, you have two of the creepiest hit men ever seen on screen thrown in there. By today's standards, they're not too politically-correct. But whether it was then or now, they still seem to have been airdropped in from a much darker story.Diamonds Are Forever is a mixed bag. Most serious Bond fans will hate it. I only like it because I remember it from my childhood and I never really got all the plot holes and silliness that came with it.Don't hate it too much. It's not that bad, but it certainly is the 'odd Bond out' from Connery's time as the secret agent. You may only watch it once, but if you like Roger Moore's 'lighter' Bond, you may get some enjoyment out of this.",Diamonds Are Forever
49,ThomasDrufke,Nothing Lasts Forever,5,12 October 2015,"It's funny, I read reviews of Goldfinger that said that film changed the tone and course of Bond films for a long time, and I think that writer was right. Since Goldfinger, it has been average Bond movie after average Bond movie. The tongue and cheek tone that Goldfinger sort of inspired had already grown tiresome and over the top by Diamonds Are Forever.Connery is back, which is obviously a step up from Lazenby, but Blofeld once again changed actors. Apparently this reflects the chameleon like nature of Blofeld in the books, but it fails to create a sense of rhythm and consistency to the franchise. With that being said, he was one of the better Blofelds we have had and made for a decent foe. The problem is that the tone of the rest of the film is so goofy and dissimilar to what Bond and Blofeld are in. The action sequences are improved since the unorthodox editing of On Her Majesty's Secret Service without the strange settings of Thunderball and You Only Live Twice.Even the sidekick villains in the film are borderline un-watchable. By today's standards, these assumed gay characters would be seen as portrayed very offensively, but I guess that was just the time the film was released. So other than the fact that this film has the dumbest cops in film history, weird duo characters, and it's tonally inconsistent, it is a decently entertaining film. We finally get a good back and forth between Blofeld and Bond, and Connery is back (at least for one film).

The story is fine, the stunts are fun, but what really drags this movie down is the acting. I don't know how they managed to fit so many bad actors in one movie.

52,CuriosityKilledShawn,Good morning! I was out walking my rat and I seem to have lost my way.,6,31 January 2007,"Diamonds Are Forever could have been a great Bond, instead of merely an entertaining one. If Lazenby returned to face-off against Television Savalas as Blofeld once more then it would make a great double-bill with the surprisingly strong OHMSS. But instead we're stuck with Connery returning for one last film in his final appearance as 007 and Charles Gray (!!!) as Blofeld. A bit of a weird casting choice since Gray already played a completely different character in You Only Live Twice. He even has hair! The story has Bond attempt to foil Blofeld's latest evil schemes by tracking bunch of conflict diamonds from Africa to Las Vegas. It turns out that Blofeld needs them to power an orbiting death-ray or whatever and obviously Bond can't allow that.Despite this far-fetched plot, it does play down the usual eccentricities of the Bond franchise. There are no silly gadgets and no fancy cars. But their IS a very cool, red 1971 Ford Mustang. I always thought that a muscle car in a Bond movie would be an interesting edge and here Bond uses one to out-run the cops in Vegas' Fremont Street. A pretty cool scene. Another cool scene would be Bond's 'elevator trip' to Blofeld's penthouse office. A true moment of dangerous espionage indeed.I don't like a couple of elements in DAF however. The two furiously gay hit men out to whack everyone who come into contact with the diamonds really got on my nerves and I found them a bit disturbing. I believe they were intended as un-PC comic-relief, but that's not how I took it. The character of Plenty O'Toole (a stupid, stupid name unless she's a pornstar) is totally pointless and scenes cut from the film make her final fate utterly senseless. The chopper attack on the oil rig is kind of lame too and Blofeld's fate isn't disclosed.Never mind though, there's still Plenty O'Humor (sorry, I couldn't resist) and some good action to balance out its shortcomings. Trouble is, it only ends up being an above-average entry in the series. Keep a lookout for Captain Spaulding as one of the funeral home thugs.",Diamonds Are Forever

Connery looks old and bored, which is not surprising given the rehashed plot and rather dreary action sequences. The pre-credit sequence reveals that Bond has also become alarmingly misogynistic. Rather than just shoot Bond and get it over with, Blofeld concocts elaborate plans to kill the agent, allowing the latter to escape to make another sequel. St. John gallantly carries on the tradition of lovely Bond women, doing much of her acting in a bikini. The final shootout goes on much too long and ends in a whimper.",Diamonds Are Forever
55,The-Sarkologist,Classic Bond with the exception of Blofeld. Bring back Telly Sevalas,8,1 February 2013,"This is the last of the Bond films to feature SPECTRE and the second to last one to feature Blofeld as the main enemy. Connery returns for this film, because apparently they made an offer that he could not refuse, but this is the last official Bond film that he appears in, and the franchise is then taken up by Roger Moore with a multitude of new opponents. Connery does take the role better in this film than in the previous appearance, but maybe it is because he knew that it would be his last one, and that they already had some options in the winds.The film opens immediately after On Her Majesty's Secret Service, where Bond is hunting Blofeld after the murder of his wife, shortly after they were married. He finally catches up with Blofeld, but it was disappointing that the bald headed guy that had appeared in the last two movies had been replaced with a grey haired guy. The suggestion is that Blofeld has had plastic surgery to change his appearance, however it is clear that Bond does recognise him. Personally I was disappointed that they had changed Blofeld's character, and the movie definitely loses points for that.However, this is still one of my favourites, and most memorable, films. The bulk of the action takes place in Las Vegas where Bond is on the trail of a diamond smuggling cartel. It seems that Spectre has pretty much been defeated, and this is Blofeld's last attempt at world domination. However, we do not realise that Blofeld is actually involved until most of the way through the movie, as the organisation is some shadowy group that appears to be connected with the mob.Two of the main antagonists are interesting, yet they are also incredibly brutal. In the book they were the antagonists, and Blofeld seemed to have been added simply as an after thought. I guess it is good that after this film they could no longer use SPECTRE because they were then forced to look for new and other antagonists to send Bond up against.",Diamonds Are Forever

57,slightlymad22,"Connery Is Back, But It'a A Bit Too Camp To Be Taken Seriously",5,8 May 2017,"Diamonds Are Forever (1971)Plot In A Paragraph: A diamond smuggling investigation leads James Bond (Connery) to Las Vegas, where he uncovers an evil plot involving a rich business tycoon.I remember thinking this was the best James Bond ever made, when I first seen it. It clearly isn't. It does have some things going for it though, but sadly it's a sign of the series going down the campier territory that would define the Roger Moore years. It's chase scenes (one including a moon buggie) are silly, it's action is pretty bland and there is never any real danger or excitement!! No matter how many people die (and there is plenty) Bond is only ever knocked out, and when he becomes invincible, it's all kind of pointless. There was also two gay assassins, played by Bruce Glover and Putter Smith who despite being ruthless killers, were actually fun to watch until their final showdown with Bond, which despite giving me big laughs as a kid it is pretty poor to watch now!! I think a TV Producer missed a trick, in not giving them their own TV show. The highlight of the full thing for me is Lana Wood as Plenty O'Toole and the theme song, again sung by Shirley Bassey. Diamonds Are Forever grossed $43 million at the domestic box office, to end 1971 the 3rd highest grossing movie of the year (only Fiddler On The Roof and The French Connection grossed more) beating the Dirty Harry movie.

59,Rodrigo_Amaro,Nice Bond flick but far from being one of the best,6,12 May 2021,"In the meantime ""No Time to Die"" doesn't get released, to enjoy myself with James Bond movies why not look back to the old flicks? ""Diamonds are Forever""
celebrates its 50th anniversary as I write this and since it was one of those films in the franchise of which I wasn't a fan over the years I decided it to
give another shot. It was nice seeing this time, in this day and age although the film hasn't aged well with its excessive use of humor, lots of dialogue that
goes nowhere and as 007 says at some point this mission isn't for him (I mean diamond smuggling? MI-6 can do better than this). But I enjoyed it watching this
time around but it still remains as one of the weakest films in the franchise.Sean Connery returns after Lazenby's failure (probably handsomely paid for such return since he wanted to retire from the character back in ""You Only Live Twice"")
and he doesn't mess around in action. This time Bond's mission is to track down diamonds, smuggle down and discover who's behind a great scheme for those. It turns
his old enemy Blofeld (Charles Gray) isn't dead and he's the one who wants to use the diamonds to control a satellite system that can bring the world down. As
assistance Bond gets the help of Tiffany Case (Jill St. John), a mystery woman of all sorts.Highlights of this movie: Bond killing the Blofeld cover right at the opening by dropping lots of mud; the car chase in Las Vegas (even though it went
a little too long and no musical score was used, it made it all tiring at points); the exciting duo of girls kicking and toying with Bond - amazing sequence
that ends up quite funny); the henchmen played by Bruce Glover and Putter Smith with their original killing methods of their victims; and Q (Desmond Llewelyn) using the slot machines and winning in all of those since he has a tricky device).Why the movie struck me as a downer? The plot is too simplistic, unworthy of Bond and it takes too long to develop; this Blofeld, although filled with tricks,
didn't cause much of an impression as Donald Pleasence caused on us back in 1967, here Charles Gray plays the man in disguise and his style here didn't match
our impression of the villain; too much humor that almost makes the film look cartoonish, to not be taken seriously and also far too many words and few action
sequences. But the main idea by the writers just wasn't all that good, it's polluted and contrived, doesn't make Connery look as good as he was in ""Dr. No"" or
""Goldfinger"".On a final analysis I enjoyed this entry because I'm a sucker for 007 films and this one delivered some spectacle and I was entertained. Big fan of the franchise and I still got two more to look back and see if I can give a
different perspective or if it'll remain the same as being bad films - some of the ones people claim as bad I still find enjoyable. 6/10.",Diamonds Are Forever

61,johnnyboyz,"Perhaps thankfully, Diamonds are not ""Forever"", but it does occupy the time rather nicely in what is an entry tough to hate.",6,8 August 2013,"Sean Connery's return to the role of James Bond sees him re-balance the score line of 3-to-2 to 4-to-2, in favour of the positive. Having left on some unscrupulous terms, disagreements with the production company and two mediocre films in a row, he blasts back into the fray with an entry that maintains the grounded, ""un-Bondian"" feel that had to follow the likes of ""Thunderball"" and ""You Only Live Twice"" in this: Diamonds are Forever. In a sense, this is like a combination of the aforementioned two films as well as George Lazenby's lone entry ""On Her Majesty's Secret Service""; combining a rooted sensibility with that unmistakable panache Connery brings to the role on top of its desire to tick the usual boxes in providing all the glamorous women; stunts as well as a showdown in an enemy's lair. There is an odd feeling of change littered throughout Diamonds are Forever, an odd imbalanced gear to things wherein Bond's actor is different; Blofeld's actor has changed, although the actor already appeared in one of Connery's earlier entries, on top of this very gradual sense that things are coming to an end for Blofeld's organisation SPECTRE. Preceding this entry and as the franchise grew, there is an unmistakable sense that Bond has already picked his way through the various villains associated with the organisation and now, following two duels with the man himself, the end may very well be neigh.The film begins with Connery seeking vengeance for something that happened to the same character when it was played by another man. Now seemingly immune to women after having genuinely loved one in the last entry, only to have her taken away from him, he is sceptic to the charms of a bikini-clad bimbo and instead uses the very item that accentuates her sexuality, in her clothing, to demand answers through an interrogation. One thing leads to another and Charles Gray's Blofeld is happened upon in a secret base wherein he has successfully cloned himself. Things are rounded off with Blofeld seemingly out of the picture and with the series free to crack on with fresh directions.The bulk of the piece comes to revolve around a smuggling ring, a ring specialising in the transporting of diamonds from South Africa to Europe. Back in London at headquarters, Bond even asks as to why the department being brought in on such a routine operation. One imagines that, after averting the world's economy from collapsing and foiling plots to initiate a Third World War a full two times, this would seem rather droll in comparison. Those thieves, bandits and crooks in the smuggling trade don't even know how close they came to annihilation on two separate counts, had it not been for the heroism of this man. Here, he is told to impersonate a renowned diamond smuggler, who has already been caught, and infiltrate the circles abroad by first meeting with his American contact. Mission in tow, Bond is far from sent jetting off to the far flung thriving metropolis' of Tokyo, nor indeed is he sent to somewhere whereby he may garner access to Jamaica's rum bars and tropical beaches. Nor even is he sent packing to the mysterious passageways and Cold War paranoia drenched streets of Istanbul. No, for he takes a hovercraft to Holland.When he arrives, we observe a decent first hour or so in what essentially transpires to be a prelude to something like ""Charley Varrick"", or even Peckinpah's ""The Getaway"". While vastly inferior to each of those examples, the film maintains this bizarre atmospheric of chase and deception as each party tries to remain one up in the company of another; something unknown in a Bond film to this point and not again seen until 1977's ""The Spy Who Loved Me"", where the arid locale of Egypt doubled up for this scorching playground wherein varying parties would try to get their hands on some valuable data at the cost, potentially, of one another's lives. Jill St. John plays the American contact, a woman named Tiffany Case who exudes a sort of tantalising presence on the screen as business and pleasure threaten to meld together on top of the fact Bond is deceiving her in adopting a false identity. Two folks who are desperate to get their hands on the diamonds are the quite riotous Mr. Wint (Glover) and Mr. Kidd (Smith), two homosexual hit men, whose choice of lifestyle does rear up some problematic issues for the film but regardless, quite honestly steal the film.The film is synonymous with an era in the Bond franchise whereby surrounding entries saw Bond tackle class-A drugs; an elusive assassin and a form of pharmaceutical warfare inherent in On Her Majesty's Secret Service. There is a great deal of colour and exuberance to the film, perhaps surprisingly so. Here is the follow up to the film that saw Bond lose a lover, but there isn't necessarily an mite of anguish nor suffering. Moreover, there features a homosexual hit men couple; the odd sequence whereby two women seemingly beat Bond up in a luxury Nevada villa for absolutely no apparent reason; a car chase involving a moon-buggy and the shrill glamour and spectacle of seeing a place such as Las Vegas in a Bond film where, ordinarily, grot and greyed out colour schemes dominate an already oppressive espionage atmosphere. I don't suppose there's anything greatly wrong with Diamonds are Forever, it just isn't a particularly fascinating entry; worse were made earlier, better were made subsequently – this is brighter, more sparky entry which uses its MacGuffin well and pulls some neat surprises on us.",Diamonds Are Forever
62,filipemanuelneto,An American Bond?,3,31 March 2016,"Directed by Guy Hamilton, produced by Harry Saltzman and Albert Broccoli and with screenplay by Richard Maibaum and Tom Mankiewicz, this is the seventh film in 007 franchise and resumes the participation of Sean Connery in the role of the British agent for the last time. This movie will attempt to Americanize the character, an option that, for today's fans, was highly incorrect, despite the success at the box office.In this film, James Bond seeks revenge on Blofeld, who blames the death of his wife, Tracy Bond. At the same time, he investigates the disappearance of diamonds in South Africa, suspecting trafficking. During investigations in Amsterdam, Bond found suspected links with the United States, where the stolen diamonds are sent. Narrowly escapes death in a crematorium and continues to follow the clues to Las Vegas, where he will face again Blofeld, the mastermind behind the theft of diamonds, with which it plans to build a space satellite that destroy entire cities.Although Sean Connery returned to the role of 007, the film's producers know they will not be forever. On the other hand, the pressure for adapting the character to a new audience increases with the entry in the seventies. Although the plot is almost entirely passed in the United States, the film has almost no action scenes, on the contrary: some particular scenes are perfectly anecdotal, in a humorous style that did not benefit the film. On the other hand, it appears to interpret the character Connery no motivation and no concern that shown in previous films into thinking it would have been better to the paper, once and for all, to another actor. The theme of space conquest, which was fashionable during this time, it could also have been better used, as would be in future films.In this film, apart from central casting inherited from previous films, James Bond is incarnated by Sean Connery.

Producers Albert R. Broccoli and Harry Saltzman got their man, but the ""James Bond"" franchise got its first stinker. What starts out a fairly promising, grounded diamond-smuggling spy film flies off the handle as Bond descends upon Las Vegas and must stop another over-the-top villainous plot.""Diamonds"" was clearly intended to recreate the franchise's peak, like an early ""best of"" film. From Shirley Bassey's second series theme song to the return of director Guy Hamilton (""Goldfinger"") and the nefarious Blofeld (now played by Charles Gray), Broccoli and Saltzman hit the reset button after ""On Her Majesty's Secret Service,"" a move that paid financial dividends, but little else. The story, for one, just kind of perpetually rolls forward without ever any setup, suspense or stakes aside from a few ""how will Bond get out of this jam?"" moments. Bond infiltrates a diamond-smuggling ring and teams up with American Tiffany Case (Jill St. John) in Amsterdam, unaware that a trail of bodies connected to diamond-smuggling lay in his wake thanks to the shifty and odd duo of Mr. Wint (Bruce Glover) and Mr. Kidd (Putter Smith). Bond and Case arrive in L.A. and Bond rendezvous with his CIA pal Felix Leiter (Norman Burton) before bringing the diamonds to a funeral home. Then Bond ends up in Vegas at a hotel called the Whyte House  anyway, this follow-the-diamonds story is not hard to keep track of but it feels like an endless goose chase with each scene assigned the sole purpose of putting the next scene in motion.The action meant to punctuate the various plot points falls flat under Hamilton's direction in this film despite Hamilton's success in ""Goldfinger."" The car chases and the climactic oil rig scene take on an almost slapstick tone — and Bond's fight with two gymnasts flat- out does. And somehow, John Barry's score is missing the iconic ""Bond"" music at all the most opportune times. Way too much of the action is set to silence. Then there's the laughable special effects used in the end that highlight just how badly the movie has unraveled. To be fair, ""Diamonds"" has its classic ""Bond"" touches and plenty of clever moments, gadgets and one-liners. Writer Richard Maibaum, who penned nearly every previous film, is involved yet again here to ensure that continuity. The franchise doesn't lose its mojo in ""Diamonds"" (if for no other reason than Connery's involvement), but these highlights are just floating adrift, unable to make themselves useful in bolstering the story.Perhaps Connery is the greatest to ever play Bond, and the role fit him like a perfectly tailored tuxedo, but his mere presence alone and our familiarity with it doesn't carry ""Diamonds are Forever."" He's just kind of going along with it, not that the script gives him an alternative. Everyone involved in the film seems to assume the plot is simply a vehicle for Connery and the iconic parts of ""Bond"" to exist again, but they prove that not just any story is fit for 007. Unfortunately, it results in a lackluster, tacky sendoff for Connery's Bond.~Steven CThanks for reading! Visit Movie Muse Reviews for more",Diamonds Are Forever

67,Anonymous_Maxine,"While superior to several of the Bond films that precede as well as succeed it, Diamonds Are Forever still lacks in many areas.",8,9 August 2001,"One of the better things about this installment in the James Bond series is that the film gets interesting almost immediately, despite the below average opening sequence. Bond unleashes a vat of stuff on a guy who was being made into a clone, and I guess he drowned in it, or something. And what was that that he aimed at Bond, a squirt gun? Not a very good opening, and the theme song, by the way, was also one of the worst of the entire series. And of course, as is the tradition with Sean Connery's James Bond, he is drinking within the first few minutes of the film. But soon after this, Bond ends up trading identities with a man named Peter Franks, and this is where it really starts to get interesting.Diamonds Are Forever deals with a villain (Blofeld, back for more) who is smuggling huge quantities of diamonds with the ultimate goal of using them to create a super powerful `laser' with which he plans to hold the United States hostage, demanding whatever ransom he wants. I don't think that they specified a dollar amount, but it was probably around one MILLION dollars!' While it is surprisingly entertaining the way that Bond switches identities, resulting in the belief that he is dead (but that mistake has been made before, hasn't it?), some things about the premise of this film bothered me. For example, for such a physically small quantity of diamonds being transported, I'm not sure I understand the need for the tremendously elaborate methods by which it is transported. They are stuffed into a teddy bear and awarded at a rigged carnival game, they're put into a dead man's coffin, cremated, and delivered in the urn, etc. Why don't they just throw them into the trunk of a car and drive them to where they're going? I guess it's because if they did that, there would be no movie.
(spoilers) Once again, there is an abundance of ineffective day for night photography (which is seen in most of the early Bond films, and it never works), as well as plenty of bad acting and people getting killed who just should have known better. The guys in the helicopter that exploded early in the film, for example, died because of their own stupidity. Here's a lesson, if someone hands you a box and starts quickly backing away, it may be a good idea to achieve some distance from that box yourself. Also, the two inseparable thugs Mr. Kidd and Mr. Wint delivered some of the worst acting I've ever seen in a Bond film, which increased the morbid satisfaction felt during their horrible deaths. Not only could they not act, but they spoke almost exclusively in clichés  `If God had meant man to fly, he would've given him wings,' `Strange how everyone who touches the diamonds winds up dead.' Oh, and another thing - in one scene in the film, Bond is managing an escape, and he jumps into a `moonbuggy,' driving off to eventual safety. What the hell was going on there? Were they faking a moon landing? Making a movie? Or just waiting for James to come along and borrow their buggy to drive to safety? At any rate, the ensuing chase scene was entertaining enough, particularly the hilarious three wheelers. Despite all of the many shortcomings of this film, however, Diamonds Are Forever still stands as an above average Bond film. Sean Connery is just as effective as ever in the title role, and the story, while not wholly probable, was more realistic than some of the other films (see: You Only Live Twice). Also, the ever-present one liners were better than usual, and every single one was better than every one-liner that Pierce Brosnan ever delivered. While they are clearly connected to the sexual innuendos that constantly surround Bond in his films, some of them are downright funny  `Providing collar and cuffs match,' `That's a nice little nothing you're wearing. I approve!' and of course, after having been introduced to the beautiful Plenty O'Toole, `Named after your father, perhaps?'
It's good to see that there was some thought put into the story for Diamonds Are Forever, but some parts were clearly not thought out at all. For example, there is a scene where the idiotic Mr. Kidd and Mr. Wint drive out of a cave in the desert, and after they drive out, a door closes, covering the cave and making it look like just another piece of desert. Sure, the cave's opening is hidden, but there is also a road leading right up to it. Seems that the road might give something away. Also, when Bond finally gets to Willard Whyte's location, he pretty much stands still and lets a couple of scantily clad women smack him around for a little while.  And speaking of which, why are there women in bikinis all over the place? The vast majority of these costumes are completely unnecessary and only serve to lower this film to the level of the cheesy B-movie that relies on nudity to drive its bonehead plot. Luckily, the plot in this film is interesting enough to be able to overcome these things. This is also the film that made me think about starting a list of how many Bond films end with him on a boat at sea, after having obviously gotten the girl, which you know will happen from the moment you pick the film off the shelf at the video store. We know Bond's going to get the girl, but they could at least come up with a different way to end it. Overall, Diamonds Are Forever is a heavily flawed film, but it also has a great many strengths that revive interest and make it worth watching.",Diamonds Are Forever
68,jzappa,One of the Very Best Bonds,8,11 February 2007,"Diamonds Are Forever is undoubtedly one of the very best Bond films. It's one of the most tightly directed, humorous, and most intelligent of the twenty-one.The plot is very smart. It moves with elusive and detailed grace. You will be surprised when certain characters or story elements leave and then suddenly return after the streaming of the plot has seemingly established itself. Diamonds Are Forever has two of the best Bond villains of the whole series, a sadistic and ruthless gay couple that finishes each other's sentences.Sean Connery is possibly at his sexiest as Bond here in his final round in the official series, debonair as can be and with the suavest delivery of one-liners and mandatory bad puns upon beating someone up or killing them. He is without a doubt the best of all the Bonds.Jill St. John, doubtlessly one of the sexiest Bond women ever, is given the short straw however, projecting one of the film's few flaws. She begins as a surprisingly clever and resourceful early Bond woman. It is only the fault of the writing that she, a common American criminal, somehow knows of elite British Secret Service agent James Bond, as if he were a celebrity, or that she spots Blofeld by his white cat even though she had never seen either one before, nor was there any chance for Bond to describe to her Blofeld or the cat. Alas, being an early Bond woman, her strength of character just could not last. Gradually throughout the film, her character becomes ditsier, weaker, dumber, and without clarity in her character's motivation. This is typical of Bond films and the earlier the Bond film, the more prevalent that unfortunate chauvinistic element is. At least most of the earlier Bond women were better actresses than they were in the later Roger Moore and Timothy Dalton films. It was an even trade-off: In order to be a powerful female character in a James Bond movie, you had to be a bad actress. If you were a good actress, you had to be a weak little girlie.Driving the movie alone is the theme song sung by Shirley Bassey and John Barry's brilliant and pulsing score. James Bond films are known for the strength in their music, and Diamonds Are Forever is one of the brightest highlights in that area.",Diamonds Are Forever
69,GOWBTW,Diamonds are everything they say to be!,9,16 May 2009,"What are a girls' best friend? Diamonds! They stimulate, please and tease. They last more than anything else in the world. In ""Diamonds are Forever"", they prove a point there. Anyone and everyone can kill for a stone with such worth. A villainous organization called SPECTRE led by Blofeld(Charles Gray) are at it again. This time, he goes after some diamonds. And James Bond(Sean Connery), is up to his old tricks again. Wooing, pummeling, and getting the info he needs to find and stop Blofeld. He gets a little help from a simply misguided woman name Tiffany Case(Jill St.John), who runs afoul of Blofeld. The best scenes in this movie are the police chase where Bond handles the Ford Mustang, and when he tangles Bambi and Thumper. The real kicker is when Bond takes out the sadistic duo of Wint and Kidd, after his first folly in Las Vegas. This movie happens to be Connery's final Bond film. Of course, Connery went on to do other pictures as well. He happens to be my favorite Bond. This movie is a true gem to its meaning! 4.5 out of 5 stars!",Diamonds Are Forever

He should be out for blood, after the latest Bond installment. Oddly enough, Connery doesn't seem to mind the events of the past as much as a normal, feeling person would. Although the character has Stavros Blofeld foremost in his thoughts, Connery fails to transfer any emotion onto film, and comes off completely plastic.Also making a comeback (aside from prolific gadgets), is the over done opening musical number the world has come to identify with the Bond franchise.Connery seems agitated in the role, as though he is no longer comfortable within his own skin. Well, one thing is for sure, the franchise is far better off without Connery and his dialed-in performances. This should have been a grand finale for Connery's Bond, but instead, it played like a funeral dirge. So much for the first Bond movie made in the US.All in all? If you're trying to follow the overall thread of this franchise, you really can't miss this installment, but if you're just looking for a good Bond movie, I'd suggest anything except the David Niven/Peter Sellers ""Casino Royale.""

This is Connery in a film that had all the coming Moore tropes. And that doesn't work.Had Diamonds are Forever been a Roger Moore 007, it wouldn't have been that bad.

72,freemantle_uk,The return of Sean Connery,3,18 November 2012,"After On Her Majesty's Service Secret disappointed at the box-office, despite revisionist reviews and viewers considered it one best and most emotional Bond films, Sean Connery was begged to return to the series. Diamonds Are Forever is his last official Bond film and the last official Bond film to feature SPECTRE and Bond's nemesis, Ernst Stavro Blofeld (unless you count the disgraceful cameo in For Your Eyes Only).After a personal mission of vengeance for his decreed wife against Blofeld (Charles Gray), MI6's best agent, James Bond (Connery) is asked to investigate a diamond smuggling operation, leading him on a trial from South Africa, to Amsterdam and Las Vegas and taking on a funeral director, Las Vegas casinos, a billionaire tycoon and two gay hit men.As well as the return of Connery, Guy Hamilton, the director of Goldfinger and Goldfinger's singer Shirley Bassey. Diamonds Are Forever starts off really strong as Bond beats up a lot of contacts to get to Blofeld, including strangling a woman with bikini top which was surprisingly dark. The fight in the film was early one in the film as a Bond fights a man in a lift: it was a tight, close quarters affair that was well choreographed and edited.The first half of the film was the better half as it was a serious yet fun affair, featuring a decent enough plot and some down to earth gadgets. But as the film continued into Las Vegas Diamonds Are Forever becomes a more camper, light hearted affair. The setting, set design and the moon buddy chase basically become elements to be used in the first Austin Powers film. Diamonds Are Forever is a more comic, cheesy film, with emphasis on silly comedy and moments like Bond fighting two women called Bambi and Thumper and the portrayed of two flamboyant henchmen. Even the Bond girl, Tiffany Case (Jill St. John) starts off as a competent woman to becoming a ditzy idiot: it is a drastic character change. This was mainly because audiences at the time did not response well to a darker, more serious and sombre Bond that George Lazenby portrayed in On Her Majesty's Secret Service and it is only until Casino Royale that audiences have accepted a darker, grittier Bond.Besides from Connery is has always been excellent as Bond, most of the cast were bad. Gray was okay as Blofeld, but he did not have the presence of Donald Pleasance or menace of Telly Savalas. Accept for the rest of the Bond regulars the cast was bad, St. John was a very bad actress, so was Lana Wood and Norman Burton was the worst actor to play Felix Leiter.In terms of scale this Bond film is lacking; much of the action takes place in Las Vegas, limiting the scale non feel s very exotic and limiting the scope. The Las Vegas setting was basically an attempt to make the series appeal more to American audiences.As a direct follow up to On Her Majesty's Secret Service, Diamonds Are Forever is a disappointment for discarding the revenge storyline and focusing on a lighter story. But as a standalone Diamonds Are Forever is decent. It is better then other films in the series like Moonraker, The Man With the Golden Gun and Die Another Day. It's enjoyable enough, but not the most memorial film of the series.",Diamonds Are Forever

74,drqshadow-reviews,Bond Struggles with the Uncertainty of Middle Age,3,18 April 2014,"A real disaster of a flick that clearly reflects the uncertainty and disarray surrounding the franchise at the time. With George Lazenby out of the picture and a small cavalcade of fill-ins dropping off for one reason or another, EON pressed the panic button and brought Sean Connery out of mothballs for a swan song. It's a mistake from the very start. Not only does Connery look unreasonably old for the part, he badly overplays his confidence and worldliness, often coming off as desperate and smarmy. The screen is crowded with gaudy sideshow characters, including a trashy, ditsy leading lady and two villainous hit men who seem far more concerned with excessively elaborate setups than actually doing away with anybody. Even longtime nemesis Blofeld, who may have been the sole beacon of excellence in the equally-forgettable You Only Live Twice, is ruined by an awful recasting, horrendous new personality quirks and a master plan that makes no sense whatsoever. But that's par for the course, really, as the plot at large is peppered with so many dumb jokes and absurd asides that just keeping up with this swerving, goofball storyline is a challenge worthy of MI-6. There's a good car chase midway through the second act (which loses some steam thanks to a similar pursuit, just a few minutes earlier, involving a freaking moon rover) and a few of the gags are so mind-blowingly stupid that I couldn't help but laugh, but otherwise this is a completely insignificant chapter in the character's long, speckled history. Unless you're a dedicated completist, keep your distance.",Diamonds Are Forever
75,Fluke_Skywalker,Diamonds is more of a Cubic Zirconia,4,14 June 2021,"'Diamonds are Forever' may be a Connery Bond film, but it sure plays like a Roger Moore one. I suppose the goal was to lighten things up after the more serious and sophisticated 'On Her Majesty's Secret Service'. Bad call.Contrary to my memory, Connery doesn't mail it in completely here, but he seems to realize it's not up to the standards of his previous outings and performs accordingly. The supporting cast are varying degrees of okay. Jill St. John may just be the most beautiful Bond girl of all-time. She certainly has the best body. Woof. And she's actually really good when she's allowed to be the feisty character she starts out as. But for some reason she slowly degrades into this dim-witted and useless passenger for Bond. Henchman Wint and Kidd are kind of fun but this entry's Blofeld is an absolute embarrassment.The story is lame and inconsequential, it looks cheap and none of the uninspired antics and hi jinks are fun enough to spackle over its many cracks.

Connery and St. John have real chemistry and the villains are dynamite, including a kinky duo named Mr. Wint and Mr. Kidd. Both St. John and Grey have many tart tongued lines of dialog.

The movie somewhat doesn't gives a the feel of a proper bond movie.Plot of the movie is not fresh and we can see a cocktail of few of the older bond movies, screenplay is average, however it impresses in between. Action scenes are not memorable and disappoints and few can feel that the age was really catching up with Mr. Connery as he was little slow in the reflections. while doing action scenes. Acting is good in the movie and Sir Connery never disappoints with his acting and Charles Gray was equally effective in his role although few of the support cast disappoints.

Charles Gray and Jill St. John are decent as Blofeld and Tiffany, respectively. My favourites here, in truth, are actually Mr. Wint and Mr. Kidd, played by Bruce Glover and Putter Smith - I was extremely interested whenever they appeared.Away from the cast, Shirley Bassey's soundtrack is awesome.

80,JoeKarlosi,Diamonds Are Forever (1971) **1/2,6,29 November 2006,"Put this one down for me as not only the least of the Sean Connery films, but one of the more unimpressive of all the James Bond films put together. No, it's not a total disaster (none of the Bond movies are complete flops) and this has its moments for the discriminating 007 fan, but after all something's got to linger near the basement when you're dealing with a series that's now going over 20 films (as of this writing). I'd start with a brief description of the plot, but therein lies the first problem -- this movie's everywhere, and it's pretty hard to understand. Let's just say it's got something to do with diamond smuggling and James Bond gets to tangle with his arch nemesis, Ernst Stavro Blofeld -- and therein lies the second problem......one of the biggest mistakes in the Bond movie series is that the character of Blofeld has been played by so many different actors that it gets rather stupid trying to believe they're all one and the same. In earlier films the situation was handled best of all by leaving the notorious crime boss hidden in shadow, albeit for the fearsome sound of his foreign accented voice. Then we had Donald Pleasance suddenly embodying the official ""look"" of Blofeld in YOU ONLY LIVE TWICE , followed by a later drastic change into Telly Savalas (aka Kojak) in ON HER MAJESTY'S SECRET SERVICE. Now in DIAMONDS ARE FOREVER we're expected to believe that the formerly bald Blofeld has gained a full head of hair and yet another voice change as Charles Gray! Not to mention that Gray was already featured as another character a couple of films ago and is overly theatric as Blofeld here. Without going into the ending of the last film (ON HER MAJESTY'S SECRET SERVICE) we've been anxiously waiting for Bond to encounter Blofeld again, and when he does in this movie it's actually a rather friendly affair! Completely disappointing after the circumstances laid out in OHMSS, and quite a gyp.Other flaws -- the two side bad guys, Mr. Wint and Mr. Kidd, are quite silly and among the worst in the series. Bruce Glover (as Wint) isn't that bad, but musician-turned-actor Putter Smith (as Kidd) is a waste. He had no acting experience and it shows every time we're subjected to his hippy face on screen (though he does get one good moment at the end aboard a boat). There's a car chase through the streets of the glitzy Las Vegas which is among the dullest you'll ever see, and I've saved the most important for last ... Sean Connery. In case you didn't know, Connery bowed out of the series two films ago, which is why we got stuck with the ineffective George Lazenby last time... but Connery was paid a huge sum of money (for the early '70s) to come back once more for DIAMONDS, and so here he is again -- but unfortunately, now he appears somewhat disinterested and too old for his brand of James Bond. It's a pity Sean didn't star in OHMSS instead, thus allowing Roger Moore to debut for DIAMONDS, as this type of comic book film was much more suited to Moore's humorous style. The silly character of Willard Whyte as portrayed by Jimmy Dean is also more suited to the Moore era. And Lana Wood sounds like she's never recited a line of dialogue in her life before when she first introduces herself to Bond as ""Plenty... Plenty O'Toole"". You can also count the theme song ""Diamonds Are Forever"" as a series low point for me.So is anything exceptionally good in DIAMONDS ARE FOREVER? Well, the pre-credits sequence is fun, Whyte's two fighting ladies Bambi and Thumper are a kick, and I kind of like Jill St. John as the new girl, Tiffany Case. There's a fight scene inside a small elevator that's pretty cool, and we do have Sean Connery back in the series for one last time, even if it is as an actor with a price and a noticeable desire to move on. **1/2 out of ****",Diamonds Are Forever
81,slokes,Formula Stretching Time,7,19 March 2010,"It's my favorite Bond movie, but ask me to defend it objectively and I struggle. Yes, ""Diamonds Are Forever"" is weak in plot, continuity, character motivation, and overall depth. Yet it's an awful lot of fun.When we first meet Sean Connery, back as Bond after a four-year absence, he's kicking the tar out of assorted people trying to locate Blofeld (Charles Gray). Once that's out of the way, he is called upon to help infiltrate a diamond-smuggling ring. Bond may think it's the sort of job that's beneath him, but he will find strong reason for seeing it through.It was the first Bond movie not made in the 1960s, and the culture shock is there from the start and continues all the way through. Long sideburns, Peckinpah-like blood splats, an old lady who teaches children religion but keeps a hollowed-out Bible for smuggling stolen goods. Blofeld is seen walking around in drag. His two main henchmen, Wint and Kidd, are not only apparently gay, but seem to have a snarkily aloof attitude about their jobs. The ""Clubland"" atmosphere of Ian Fleming seems well behind us now.""You've just killed James Bond"", the lead female Tiffany Case (Jill St. John) cries.Not quite, but it's not the Bond you came to expect from earlier films.What works for me in this movie are three things. First is the music, particularly the wonderfully jaded title song, the best of any in the Bond series even if it was never a commercial hit; as well as the eerie flute-like theme that follows Wint and Kidd's appearances. Second, the clever off-kilter sensibility that successfully reworks the Bond model for a new age. Third, the humor, of satirical quips and the ever-reliable double-entendres we expect from 007.""Why are we staying in the bridal suite of the Whyte House?""""In order to form a more perfect union.""It's not a perfect film. At times, it's not even a very good one. Throughout the picture Bond gets into various scrapes he weasels out of with discomfiting ease. In fact, except for a harrowing elevator fight near the beginning of the film, there's not an instance where Bond is severely pressed.This is fine given Connery doesn't seem to be pressing much himself, He's just having fun and thus is in tune with the picture around him. Guy Hamilton, the director, never took his Bond movies too seriously, though he liked action-packed set-pieces, and thus a lot of goofy moments in ""Diamonds Are Forever"" skirt past with minimal fuss. I enjoy how the film sends itself up. Even Bond's way of approaching the villain's lair is played for a smile. Why sneak in when you can just parachute down inside a giant bubble?For some, maybe many, the problem with ""Diamonds Are Forever"" is the same as its virtue to me: It never takes itself seriously. The producers are stretching the formula, taking some chances, and tweaking some cherished notions of what Bond films are about. Not all of it works, but it's a fun ride I enjoy taking.",Diamonds Are Forever
82,Spondonman,End of an era,7,30 December 2012,"This last worthwhile Connery Bond film came out in the early '70's; it seemed to me even then at 12 years old that there had been a change in social attitudes – some degree of innocence had been lost in the 4 years since the previous film. Whereas You Only Live Twice was the usual daft and deft mix of humour and action in a nonsensical plot, Diamonds Are Forever had deft action in a nonsensical and messy plot with a touch of tired and camp cynicism.Bond is enrolled by the British government to find who is cornering the world's diamond-smuggling market and put a stop to it. It's an un-engaging battle for the viewer though, Stout Bond looks for the most part uninterested in putting in the actual work for the money for which he was enticed back. There's also probably the worst scene in any of his Bond films when he's escaping from Tectronics in a Moon buggy – to someone brought up on Banana Splits it's awful and almost slapstick. The portrayal of younger women purely as sex objects is even more pronounced than beforealthough I confess I personally I preferred to look at Jill St. John than Connery throughout. On the plus side Bond's punch up with the real Franks in the lift was exciting, the car chase through Las Vegas was amusing, and Bond getting hot under the collar in the funeral parlour was chilling – there's plenty to savour, although Plenty wasn't in it for long. God help us if the world's safety depended on the quality of cassette tape playback!Overall it's not as witty or memorable as we'd grown accustomed to, but watchable probably even for a non-completist. The next film in the series continued as The Saint, but to this day I still think the unshaken and unstirred Connery would have made a better Bond in the '70's, especially if he could've lost a lot of pounds and got a better wig. Never mind, there are the 6 movies of varying excellence and consistent entertainment from 1962-1971 to revel in every few years.",Diamonds Are Forever
83,davidmvining,Silly,3,29 January 2020,"This movie is silly, and it's silly in some pretty destructive ways that almost feel unintentional. It's also loosely built with a bored looking Sean Connery. It has its moments, but I really found this seventh Bond adventure one of the hardest to sit through.The movie begins with a frantic action beat as Bond breaks into Blofeld's secret layer, kills the man about to become his double and then Blofled himself. It feels like a continuation, but none of the events of On Her Majesty's Secret Service are even mentioned. The film even knowingly winks at the fact that Connery didn't play Bond in the previous film. This feels like the ending of a previous episode of television more than the beginning of a movie. And yes, of course, Bond movies always start with action beats that may or may not come back later, but Blofeld himself has too much history with Bond to merely discard early, even if it is a fake out. It's treated too glibly and too quickly, and it's too easily forgotten once it's over.The movie then struggles to justify why Bond should be investigating a diamond smuggling ring and never really makes the case. It's a similar situation as how Goldfinger started, but Bond was looking at a specific man who turned the tables on Bond and revealed his villainy early. In Diamonds are Forever, Bond zeroes in on the Bond Girl of the flick, Tiffany Case (played by Jill St. John and who may actually be my favorite Bond girl up to this point), but why Bond decides to continue with the investigation is murky at best. Yes, there are other levels to the scheme that she works, but it never feels like it deserves the attention of Bond until very late in the film, several schemes in.Once we do get to the point where Bond reaches the top of the loose organization and discovers that Blofeld is still alive, the movie has gone through a chase where Bond was in the most ridiculous looking moon rover chased by silly looking 3-wheeled motorbikes and Bond just sauntering into a highly secretive hidden base without trying. It's lazy and silly. He meets Blofeld by breaking into the penthouse of the fictional Whyte House in Las Vegas through the roof where Blofeld has a gun on him and could easily kill him. The villain then forces Bond into an elevator where gas knocks him out, Blofeld's goons drag Bond's body into the trunk of a car, drive him out to the desert, and place him in a pipe ready for laying. Bond then sleeps until the pipe gets laid in the ground when he awakens to the sound of a pipe checking robot coming up to him that he jumps on top of, breaks, and then waits to be rescued by the maintenance man. I have no idea what Blofeld wanted from this meandering and pointless exercise. I assume it was to kill Bond, but this makes the satire of over-complicated villain plans to kill heroes look like a real attempt at the exercise instead of making fun of it. And when Blofeld sees Bond again, he seems completely nonplussed that Bond escaped. Blofeld is just the worst in this movie.The movie has no real narrative drive, and it doesn't even really embrace the conventions of the Bond franchise (well established at this point). Q makes a very late appearance and just shows off a single gadget to rig slot machines. The stunts seems small like the chase through the Strip that is just a pristine red Ford Mustang swerving through traffic. Connery had gotten old and fat by this point, so he can't sell the action beats nearly as well as he could before, and he really seems bored going through the motions and making his record paycheck.I think the only saving grace of the film is Jill St. John as Tiffany Case. Her character doesn't make a whole lot of sense (like the rest of the film), but she's winning and bright and fun as the Bond Girl. The rest of it? Ugh.",Diamonds Are Forever
84,ArtVandelayImporterExporter,Diamonds Are a Snoozer,2,22 December 2020,"Are we sure this is really Sean Connery? What happened to the super stud of the first few films? He's been replaced by a Roger Moore imitator in a winking self-parody. A limp-dyck portrayal of Bond that barely rises above the level of a 70s TV show. And not a very good TV show, either.Connery walks with a noticeable limp at times. And in some action scenes he runs with the agility of a certain Pretendident Elect. For pete's sake he gets rag-dolled by two female gymnasts and then toss in a pool where they could easily have drowned him, but we're supposed to believe he's holding each of them down with one arm?And then the climax on the oil derrick. Why do the bad guys in terrible movies (and just about every 70s TV show) feel the need to explain their fiendish plots to the good guy. Or put them within arm's reach of foiling the whole setup?Frankly, watching this movie full-through for the first time 50 years after its release I'm convinced this was the inspiration for those insipid Austin Powers movies.

85,Zbigniew_Krycsiwiki,"Amusing, but also one of the most uneven Bond films ever",7,29 December 2007,"Film begins well, showing us Connery's return to the role (after bailing out after You Only Live Twice in late 1966/ early '67) as Bond tracks down and seemingly kills Blofeld. A perfectly done title sequence goes quite well with a great title song, before we get down to business: an initially literal adaptation of Fleming's novel, as Wint and Kidd smuggle diamonds out of Africa, after brutally killing the courier, and the deliverer. Bond, none too enthused about being assigned to what he calls ""a relatively simple smuggling matter,"" is sent to intercept the next link, a professional smuggler called Peter Franks, in Amsterdam. Bond, after rendezvousing with yet another smuggler (gorgeous Jill St. John) ends up beating Franks' ass in close-quarters-combat in a lift, in another highlight of this movie.Unfortunately, after the exciting and well done first forty minutes, leading this Bond fan to think I'm about to watch potentially one of the best Bonds, the screenplay degenerates into a seemingly never-ending series of gags and pratfalls and silly vignettes. Jill St. John and Lana Wood are both gorgeous, but Jill loses interest halfway through the movie and becomes a bumbling nitwit, and Lana Wood has only a cameo, played strictly for laughs. Throw in a Bullitt-inspired car chase through the Las Vegas Strip, a faked moon landing, a Howard Hughes clone Willard Whyte, and some type of diamond powered space laser(?) and that makes up the majority of the second half.Bond, after violently fending off the attacks of several armed guards in the pre-title sequence, and the aforementioned fight in the lift, basically has his ass handed to him by a pair of female gymnasts, in what will forever be remembered as one of the dumbest and most inane scenes in any Bond film.Charles Grey is a wonderful actor, and I do wish they had used more of him in the Bond series, but he was a terrible Blofeld, too nice of a guy to be an international terrorist set on killing Bond, and they've turned Blofeld into a cross dressing terrorist with a cat fetish? Connery's weight was obviously up and down during filming; as he is briefed by M., it looks like he needed a crowbar to fit into his suit. Likewise, by the poolside, with the body floating in it. Those thick, bushy grey sideburns only made Connery look older. Indeed, he turned 40 years old during filming, but he looked closer to 60.The ending is anticlimactic; the fight in the lift was more exciting.Overall, the film is enjoyable for its first third, then in a surreal way for its final two thirds, but I wish they had followed the plot of Ian Fleming's original novel more closely. That would have made the film consistently good. Or at least, not as uneven as it is now. Filming wrapped in September 1971, and it was released to cinemas in December of 1971; its rushed post production undoubtedly contributed to its randomness.",Diamonds Are Forever
86,brando647,007 Begins to Lose Momentum with Forgettable 7th Film,6,4 January 2014,"Having revisited the final canonical Sean Connery 007 film, DIAMONDS ARE FOREVER, I have to admit that I was wrong. I don't necessarily hate this movie, and I don't believe it's the worst Connery 007 movie in the series. That said, it's still an incredibly weak entry and a low note for Sean Connery's end to his official series run. After George Lazenby and ON HER MAJESTY'S SECRET SERVICE didn't perform as well as the studio had hoped (though it was still a success), their mission became to replicate the massive success of GOLDFINGER through any means necessary. All the signs are there: Sean Connery in the title role, Shirley Bassey performing the main theme, James Bond returning to America to unravel a complex bit of villainy, and a more toned down film that discards a lot (but not all) of the over-the-top elements of the previous films. The result is a tonally dull and overly complex that, while mildly entertaining at times, is pretty unmemorable. Following the events of the previous film, 007 concludes his worldwide manhunt for SPECTRE leader Ernst Stavro Blofeld when he confronts him and apparently kills him in a plastic surgery facility. From there, he is called in to investigate a diamond smuggling ring out of South Africa in which the diamonds have never resurfaced. When people in the smuggling chain start turning up dead, Bond finds a point of contact in Tiffany Case (Jill St. John) and poses as a smuggler to infiltrate the organization.In a sense, it was good to have Connery back in the title role. But any good will the movie has from that is soon dissolved once we get into the movie itself. From the very beginning, I felt we were off on the wrong foot when it's revealed that Charles Gray has stepped into the shoes of iconic villain Blofeld. I don't have anything against Gray (though the only other time I've seen him on film was as the short-lived MI6 contact Henderson in YOU ONLY LIVE TWICE) but he doesn't fit the Blofeld mold. The series had gone through a few Blofelds at this point and I'd always wished they'd chosen one actor (preferably Donald Pleasance) and run with him. So, a new Blofeld and it's Charles Gray. It didn't work for me but it could've been forgiven if the rest of the movie wasn't so flawed. Let's move on to Mr. Wint and Mr. Kidd. Bizarre as they were, my major complaint with them had to be the fact that Putter Smith (Mr. Kidd) can't act. This is because he's not an actor. It shows. His line delivery is awkward and lifeless, and it ruins any potential creepiness coming from Bruce Glover's Mr. Wint. Let's shift to some positive casting: the Bond women in this movie are some of the hottest. Jill St. John and Lana Wood are both gorgeous and, while Plenty O'Toole (Wood) is sort of annoying, Tiffany Case (St. John) could be considered one of the stronger Bond women of the earlier films. She's tough and independent, even if she doesn't know her associates well enough to know if she should truly trust them.Oh, one more bit of bad casting: Jimmy Dean, country star/sausage guru, as business mogul Willard Whyte. Yup.Now, I am happy that the movie attempted to tone down a lot of the over-the-top campiness of some of the more recent fare. No orbital space capsule hijackings, no phony rear projection bobsled chases, etc. The bulk of this movie handles itself with some class. Until the moon buggy chase. At one point, Bond is escaping from an industrial complex where they're filming some sort of moon landing and Bond commandeers the goofiest looking moon buggy you'll ever see, drives it through a wall, and goes bouncing off through the Nevada desert pursued by guards on strange little motor tricycles with balloon tires. As Bond careens around the desert a medium speeds, cars and motor tricycles go barreling out of control and launch off sand dunes by the guards who've apparently never operated a motor vehicle. I'm sorry, but this sequence (when combined with Wint and Kiddmostly Kidd) ruins any credibility the movie hoped to maintain. It doesn't do the movie any favors that the plot comes across as way more complex than necessary. Around the midpoint of the film, I totally lose track of who has the diamonds and where they're going and I don't regain my bearings until Bond busts into Whyte's top-floor penthouse.DIAMONDS ARE FORVER isn't the worst 007 film but it's far from one of the best. It's decent entertainment at times but there's nothing here (aside from the moon buggy chase) that remained with me after the final credits rolled when I first saw the movie years ago. The entire final act, with an assault on an oil rig, is a dud. I'd completely forgotten all about it until I rewatched the film again not long ago. As the seventh film in the series, it gives the impression that the series began to lose some steam and the 007 hit machine might not be as invulnerable as it once seemed.",Diamonds Are Forever

Connery downplays everything with the aura of a man collecting a big paycheck (see Trivia).  Ms.'s St. John and Wood wander around in poor-fitting underwear most of the time.

Starring Sean Connery, Jill St. John, Charles Gray, Norman Burton, Jimmy Dean, Bruce Glover, Putter Smith, Lana Wood, Bernard Lee, Joseph Furst, Desmond Llewelyn, Bruce Cabot, Lois Maxwell. (PG)After sitting the last one out, Connery is back for one more go-around as 007 (not counting the 1983 ""Thunderball"" remake, ""Never Say Never Again""); unfortunately, this swan song is the worst entry he starred in. Story involves a rather tedious diamond smuggling operation and a satellite laser that Blofeld (Gray) can use to once again hold the world for ransom. Producers assembled much of the same team that made ""Goldfinger"" a smash hit (director, screenwriter, composer, director of photography, even Shirley Bassey to sing the title tune), but falls far short on excitement and style, with Las Vegas serving as a not-especially-scenic locale, and featuring a weak villain (the worst incarnation of Blofeld, seen here with duplicates and, in one scene, in drag!) and Bond girls that look great, act helpless, and are performed terribly. Comic book-style hijinks and high camp factor would point the way towards the Roger Moore era; it's not a total bust (the opening scene, for example, with Bond out for revenge in the name of his murdered wife, is effectively pitiless), but still definitely a lesser outing in the franchise.59/100",Diamonds Are Forever

On his image alone it is clear why they axed Connery after 'You only Live Twice' to bring in George Lazenby; but after he was not given a warm reception by the fans, Connery is back for one last time; and his age is definitely showing.Other than his appearance though, he still has that special something that proved he was the best choice in the first place, and Diamonds Are Forever isn't a bad film, it's merely lacking the solidity and intrigue of the previous films.There's still plenty of good action, an interesting plot, the quite stunning Jill St. John and some wonderful scenery.7/10",Diamonds Are Forever

He delivers lines quite well in this lighter and campy film filled with outlandishness and quirkiness. The bond purists/ fans of early bond grind their teeth over this Bond entry due to its campiness, but I personally think it's an enjoyable Bond and I rather watch this than the current bond films starring that bricklayer in a suit who moves like a bobo doll. The direction of the franchise had changed from You only live twice and the humour had increased by the time this was released.It's obvious that Connery returned for a big pay check but he still is good here. The fistfight in the lift is a highlight. So is dune buggy scene and oil rig finale. The hot Jill St John and Charles gray really bolster things up, and the finale on the ship where 007 sends one of the creepy villain duo off with a tail between his legs is hilarious, makes me chuckle every time.

There wasn't enough excitement and it was dull and,and... I could go on with all of the film's flaws. But now let me give my attention to Diamonds are forever, a Bond film that deserves my attention. There is a lot to like about Diamonds are forever. It's exciting, entertaining, and fun. There are laughs also and a lot of action. I never said that it was the best Bond film, but I preferred it to some others. You get more from the Bond girl too, and the plot is easy to follow. The film is easy to follow.

93,Joxerlives,Blofeld doesn't only steal the diamonds but the entire film,7,17 March 2014,"So Connery is back but if we're honest by this stage he was just too old for the role, especially evident in the bathtub scenes. The real star here is Charles Gray who is just magnificent as Blofeld, oozing sinister charm and suave menace from every pore. Although most would name the great Donald Pleasance as the definitive Blofeld (certainly Mike Myers would think so) I think Gray is just superb in every way.As for the rest well the gay hit men are certainly a novel twist on an old fashioned set of characters (Fleming's attitude to homosexuals was never good, check out Goldfinger for evidence). We have the great Ed Bishop in a small role but its' fried gold and another popular American character actor in Britain, Shane Rimmer popping up for his second appearance in the series (I wonder if he is supposed to be the same person as he portrayed in You Only Live Twice?). The whole Willard White/Howard Hughes parallel is played extremely cleverly and I do love the line 'Ed, you're fired!'. On the bad side another appallingly bad Bond girl, hate the way she cowers in the final fight scene. Plenty O'Toole's death is also extremely nasty in a typically Ian Fleming fashion. The inclusion of the team of Las Vegas hoods who looks as though they've just walked out of a production of 'Guys and Dolls' is truly an eye-opener, one of them will later recur as the assassin whom Tic-Tac hires to entertain Scaramanga at the beginning of 'The Man with the Golden Gun'.Not a bad film at all but really Sean should have left it at this.",Diamonds Are Forever
94,Beta_Gallinger,Not a very good official Bond film for Connery to finish with,5,21 July 2008,"After Sean Connery, the first actor to play Ian Fleming's James Bond character on the silver screen, starred in the first five adaptations in the movie franchise, he was replaced by George Lazenby for 1969's ""On Her Majesty's Secret Service"". In my opinion, that sixth film in the franchise isn't very good overall, and Lazenby's version of the character is forgettable. After that one, Connery returned for one last official Bond film before Roger Moore took over, which was this one, ""Diamonds Are Forever"". While he still fit the role, this seventh official Bond adaptation, like the one before it, is somewhat disappointing.After it appears James Bond, Agent 007, has succeeded in killing Ernst Stavro Blofeld, he is soon sent on another mission. He is told about the South African diamond mines, and how diamonds from them have recently been mysteriously disappearing. It is suspected that this is a case of diamond smuggling, so Bond is sent undercover as a diamond smuggler named Peter Franks to Holland, where he meets another smuggler named Tiffany Case. He must gather information and find out who's responsible for this smuggling operation, and his investigations take him from Holland to America. Continuing the mission here, it turns out that Blofeld himself is once again the head of a sinister plot, and Bond faces a number of life-threatening situations as he once again tries to track down his foe! Like ""On Her Majesty's Secret Service"", this seventh official Bond film is somewhat tedious, and that's not its only problem. Early in the film, when Bond is told about the South African diamond mines and how they work, we are shown a bunch of clips. This part is like watching an educational documentary, and I doubt too many people watch these films to see something like that. Right after that sequence, the film introduces two new villains, Mr. Wint and Mr. Kidd, and I found these characters maybe a tad annoying, even though they're apparently supposed to be funny, and Bruce Glover and Putter Smith put on rather poor performances as them. After that, there's some occasional excitement, such as the elevator fight, but there's certainly not enough of it. There's also a bit of humour, such as Tiffany Case saying ""My G*d! You just killed James Bond!"" to the man she doesn't know is actually him, the scene with Tiffany playing the water balloon game with a bunch of kids, and what Bond says after he manages to escape from a pipe. However, this movie is still usually boring, and may seem like an abnormally long two hours.Like many times before, I'm not 100% sure about my rating for this movie. I feel I might be able to give it a 6/10 instead of a 5 (there MIGHT be enough suspense in the film for that), but no higher, and the highest I've ever given a Bond flick is 9, which I gave to ""Goldfinger"". (Speaking of ""Goldfinger"", like that film, Shirley Bassey did the theme song for ""Diamonds Are Forever"", but it's not as memorable as her first Bond theme.) However, like many other viewers, I still found this particular Bond flick disappointing, despite the return of Sean Connery. I would say most of the films in the official franchise starring Connery are decent, the best one probably being the classic ""Goldfinger"", and I can see why he was so popular in the role, but it's a shame it had to end with this film, possibly the worst of Connery's official Bond films.",Diamonds Are Forever
95,vip_ebriega,A second look: DIAMONDS ARE FOREVER.,5,29 April 2010,"Sadly, time has not been kind to 1971's DIAMONDS ARE FOREVER. I know I was rather enthusiastic with this entry before, and I actually remember loving it the first time I saw it. But this final entry for Sean Connery has aged poorly over the years of not seeing it. While there are still a number of things I liked about it, there are moments that made me cringe this time around. Connery, who accepted the role only because he was getting paid big-time, is actually the best thing about this entry. As usual, he IS James Bond, with all the charms we know and love from him. And another, Blofeld's (This time, played by Charles Gray) ridiculous plot of using theft diamonds to power a laser is typical Bond movie hokum - another over-the-top plot for world domination and extortion. Good action and chase sequences at least prevent it from being boring. The title song was pretty good too (sung by the one and only Shirley Bassey).But sadly, there are all too silly and mostly dull moments in DAF. Bond girl Tiffany Case (Jill St. John) remains one of the most annoying of the Bond girls (Lana Wood also appears as an even more thankless Plenty O'Toole). Elements such as Bond pitted against two sexy acrobatic women named Bambi and Thumper (!); an obligatory nod to a sillier and more comedic tone; and those two homosexual assassins (Putter Smith as Mr. Kidd and Bruce Glover as his sidekick Mr. Wint) are all dated now. But perhaps the biggest disappointment I had was Blofeld. Excellently portrayed in the first two movies he was in (though I should also note that he was so much more sinister in the earlier entries when his face is yet to be revealed), is reduced to an even more campy villain (he even disguises himself as a woman in one scene!). And by the way, what the heck happened to Bond's vendetta against Blofeld for the death of his wife? We were left dangling in the end of ON HER MAJESTY'S SECRET SERVICE only to get Blofeld back as that same old baddie who plots to destroy the world's deadliest weapons if his demands are not met.While I still did enjoy DIAMONDS ARE FOREVER, chiefly to see one of Connery's final performances as 007, I now think it's one of the lesser entries in the long-running series. Though it's far from the worst (because at least, unlike MAN WITH THE GOLDEN GUN, it's not boring), it's easily one of the Bonds that haven't aged well throughout the years. Watchable, but hardly Bond's finest hour.Rating: **1/2 out of 5.",Diamonds Are Forever
96,one9eighty,Replacing the dog as a girl's best friend - because Diamonds are Forever!,5,10 August 2020,"The 7th James Bond film see Connery back in action as the titular spy, as he goes undercover to find out about, and stop diamond smuggling on an epic scale. Blofeld is back in the picture, played by Charles Grey (who previously appeared as Henderson in ""You only live twice""). This film is often remembered as the one with the gay assassins in it; Wint & Kidd (Bruce Glover & Putter Smith) - and notably, the Bond film, which is a camp comic book caper, rather than a suave British adventure.After the pace of the 60's Bond films, this 70's Bond seems more laid back and calm, he's cool about everything and often seems that he's not in a rush to resolve things - he's more so just enjoying the ride. The film is mainly set in Las Vegas, but there are trips to LA and Amsterdam too. Bond gets to drive a moon-buggy and a Mustang (on two wheels through a tight alley), he wins at the Craps table, avoids being assassinated in a range of ways courtesy of Wint & Kidd, fights Karate/ kung-fu bunnies (Bambi and Thumper), he meets Plenty O'Toole (Lana Wood) and Tiffany Case (Jill St. John), he gets buried alive and escapes a blazing coffin, and prevents the world being held to hostage by a 'giant laser'. It feels at times that the camp spy escapades are more akin to ""The Avengers"" TV series, ""The Man from U.N.C.L.E."" or even the Adam West ""Batman and Robin"" series. With that in mind, when I say that the film is as tongue in cheek and at times almost comedic as it is an action film, I don't feel to harsh with my critique.Connery's return was prompted after the studio panicked about Lazenby's reviews in ""On Her Majesty's Secret Service"". They needed to react and originally planned to bring in American John Gavin, but then Connery agreed and was put into the role. This would be Connery's last film, again(!), but really it wasn't, as he would return in the unofficial Bond film ""Never say never again"" some 12 years later. It is amazing what a good pay cheque could inspire (just to be clear, it wasn't necessarily a greed thing, Connery put the money into a foundation for Scottish artists)! Another panic saw them bring back Goldfinger director Guy Hamilton, and a lot of his crew, to try and bring back some of the success that that film had. With all that panic, why not bring back Shirley Bassey too - and for the record, her return with the title song would prove to be another great success for her.I enjoyed this film as a passage of time. If I compared it to other Bond films then there is a clear difference in the approach and the pace. It is probably a sign of the times, the end of the 60's and colourful camp humour, and the start of the 70's with a more serious approach - which has this Bond film sandwiched in the middle almost commentating on a transition in cinema at the time. It is that sandwiching that almost steals the identity of the film, it isn't entirely sure what it should be. Nether the less, I like Connery as Bond, I prefer him to Moore. This wasn't really a fitting end to his official run as Bond, but that's not necessarily down to Connery, more due to sloppy scripting and an average plot, as a result of panicking and trying to mimic the success of ""Goldfinger"". Out of all the Bond films, this is one of the ones I remember greatly from my youth. Based on that I can confirm that it is family friendly (it certainly did not do any harm to me as a child watching it), and it is a great one-off Bond film if you just want to pick one up for some fun.In terms of Bond films this is a 6 out of 10.In terms of movies in the long and illustrious history of film I would give this a 5 out of 10.",Diamonds Are Forever

The result is not too good I must say. Despite the fact that it is a typical Bond story, there some key elements of the franchise get extremely messed up. Take for example the Bond girl. I do not know about you, but I didn't think she had much appeal or any real character (switching from here to there and back again). What the heck was her motivation??? Secondly I must say there were too much scenes with really bad effects (the laser scenes most of all). The fighting scene with Bambi and what's her name, was stupid as well. To top it off, the bad guys were not very convincing and therefore no real excitement was generated by the story. The only things that are mentionable about this film is Shirley Bassey's singing during the title and the fact that Bond hit a number home-runs with his one-liners, making my grade quite a bit better than it could have been. After seeing this film it is no wonder Connery replied: Never!' to the question: Will you play James Bond again?'

98,eminkl,"Unless you're a dedicated completist, keep your distance",3,22 April 2020,"A real disaster of a flick that clearly reflects the uncertainty and disarray surrounding the franchise at the time. With George Lazenby out of the picture and a small cavalcade of fill-ins dropping off for one reason or another, EON pressed the panic button and brought Sean Connery out of mothballs for a swan song. It's a mistake from the very start. Not only does Connery look unreasonably old for the part, he badly overplays his confidence and worldliness, often coming off as desperate and smarmy. The screen is crowded with gaudy sideshow characters, including a trashy, ditsy leading lady and two villainous hitmen who seem far more concerned with excessively elaborate setups than actually doing away with anybody. Even longtime nemesis Blofeld, who may have been the sole beacon of excellence in the equally-forgettable You Only Live Twice, is ruined by an awful recasting, horrendous new personality quirks and a master plan that makes no sense whatsoever. But that's par for the course, really, as the plot at large is peppered with so many dumb jokes and absurd asides that just keeping up with this swerving, goofball storyline is a challenge worthy of MI-6. There's a good car chase midway through the second act (which loses some steam thanks to a similar pursuit, just a few minutes earlier, involving a freaking moon rover) and a few of the gags are so mind-blowingly stupid that I couldn't help but laugh, but otherwise this is a completely insignificant chapter in the character's long, speckled history.",Diamonds Are Forever
99,The_Movie_Cat,"""Oh, providing the collars and cuffs match...""",7,26 July 2001,"Diamonds Are Forever is often described as a Roger Moore film starring Sean Connery, but it goes even farther than that. Whereas Moore ushered in ironic/silly codings, Diamonds contains the most overtly camp humour the series ever indulged in. The film also contains the most amount of nudity, and arguably the rudest jokes of the franchise. The title quote is Connery's quip to a girl with ever-changing wigs, while later we get the immortal ""I'm afraid you've caught me with more than my hands up.""There's the sense of the odd, or uneasy, about this one all the way through. From the theme title (and what a great song!) precipitated by a cat's cry to the homosexual henchmen Mr.Wynt and Mr. Kidd. Their unnerving air is not the result of their gay, slightly homophobic, portrayal, but in Putter Smith's performance as Kidd. Not a trained actor, but an accomplished jazz bassist, this off-kilter playing creates an unconscious, unsettling atmosphere.It's this juxtaposition which compels throughout. Like seeing Britain's top espionage agent doing the childhood ""snogging with yourself"" routine then smashing a man's head through a window just seconds later. It's a superficially lightweight film, but with a nasty, almost bitter undercurrent. Connery's obvious resistance to the role actually serves it well here, given that this is the first post-wife Bond movie. Bernard Lee plays an unusually terse M to complement this abrasive 007. Such a starch display cuts through the smug underpinnings of the character and makes the cheesy one-liners more palatable. He looks older than in any of his other Bond films - Never Say Never Again included  but this also fits his anguished, bereaved state. In line with this most misogynistic of Bond pictures, Jill St. John's character development passes from intelligent, through to devious and down into simpering bimbo.Incidental music is a bit disattached, and often feels like it belongs to another film. It works against, rather than with, the picture it's there to support. Yet although not quite the best of the series, this and the following Live and Let Die are the most distinctive in look, feel and style. They're light, pacy, poppish takes on the format, full of comicbook verve and wit. Guy Hamilton's direction is also very good; making the most of the LA location with use of expansive aerial shots.The plot seems fairly complex, though maybe that's because it's underdeveloped and submerged beneath slightly irrelevant setpieces. I had to smile at the line ""Get him off that machine, that isn't a toy"" as Sean boards the moonbuggy. I remember after the film it became one, a primary-coloured Dinky version with a spinning radar. Brings back memories, that.Blofeld, who has now taken up cloning and cross-dressing, is played here by Charles Gray. Although at the time it was four years before he would become the criminologist in The Rocky Horror Picture Show, the two are now inseparable, in my mind at least. As if this wasn't enough high camp to go round, there's also Connery being demolished by Bambi and Thumper, a couple of sadistic female gymnasts.If something about this quirky, offbeat Bond (and some sources list it as the seventh least successful in terms of gross) doesn't quite gel, then it greatly improves on repeat viewings.",Diamonds Are Forever

105,ofpsmith,For whatever reason this one doesn't sit particularly well with me.,5,2 May 2020,"I know I'm not being original when I say that Sean Connery is my favorite James Bond but there you have it. Connery defined how the character would be portrayed on screen long after his tenure in the role ended. From his suave demeanor and manly presence every Bond actor since him has incorporated a bit of his portrayal into their portrayal. As a result Connery's Bond movies are my favorites...with the exception of one. Diamonds are Forever started out all right but as it went on it just became a drag. The glamour felt gone from this one (largely with it being set in Las Vegas) but the larger problems existed with some of the characters. I didn't find Tiffany Case (Jill St. John) terribly impressive as a Bond Girl as she wasn't a particularly fun, helpful, or smart companion to Bond. Mr. Wint (Bruce Glover) and Mr. Kidd (Putter Smith) moreover were too bumbling and buffoonish to take seriously, and while it may have been intended to be funny I didn't find it so. Generally speaking I just found the film boring and (with the exception of the Mustang chase through Las Vegas) pretty forgettable.",Diamonds Are Forever

He didn't have much to work with. The plot is confusing and ridiculous. From riding around in a moon buggy to getting a '71 Mustang to travel on two wheels through an alley, it seemed like a half-baked episode of ""Get Smart"". This film just did not have the feel of a James Bond movie.It seemed very disconnected to all he previous Bond films. Too much of it was played for laughs and it lacked suspense and credibility. Simply put, it was just a lousy movie - poorly directed, poorly edited, with seemingly disconnected scenes everywhere.",Diamonds Are Forever
107,timdalton007,An Incredibly Mixed Big,3,22 November 2005,"After the rather ""dismal"" box-office returns of 1969's On Her Majesty's Secret Service, Producers Albert R. ""Cubby"" Broccoli and Harry Saltzman choose to leave the serious Fleming-esquire film and take the Goldfinger approach of action humor and an outrageous plot. They even went as far to give Sean Connery to play 007. The film promised to be one of the best, with Connery saying that the script was ""the best one we've had, certainly construction wise."" Unfortunately, the film isn't as good as Connery makes it to be.The problems with the film start right with the main character, 007. Sean Connery does very little in terms of acting in the film besides giving one liners that are mostly cringe worthy. The Bond we start off with in the teaser sequence of the film is apparently revenge minded and more like the Bond of Dr. No and From Russia With Love. But after Bond arrives in Las Vegas, Bond becomes a light hearted comedic character. Age is also an issue, as Connery changes hairstyle and color many times in the film and his scene with Plenty are unbelievable due to a very obvious large age difference.The main girl, Tiffany Case, is another character that starts off good and ends up comedic and useless. Her meeting Bond in Holland, her treatment of Bond and her getting the diamonds in the Circus, Circus casino shows her to be a tough character who puts Bond in his place more than once. But once the pursuit in the Moon Buggy is over and for the rest of the film, Tiffany becomes a complete bimbo and a Bond sufficient woman. This can't be blamed on Jill St. John who does the best that she can with this poorly written role.The role of Ernst Stavro Blofeld the role is both poorly written and terribly mis-casted. He is much more interesting as he hides behind the cover of Willard Whyte. It is only here that the character has any menace what so ever. Once it's revealed that Blofeld is only pretending to be Whyte, the character becomes rather tiresome. Also, Blofeld and Bond share no chemistry, such as in the previous film, between them, only adding a tired feel to the film. This is only hurt by one of the worst casting decisions in Bond history, and do I dare say all film history, Charles Gray. Gray, who is much better in his very short role in You Only Live Twice, is the worst of the trio of actors to portray Blofeld.The only bright spot cast wise is the supporting cast. Plenty O'Toole is the best of the supporting cast as she steals every scene she is in during her short appearance. Willard Whtye is a truly inspired character who is serious and only once used for a laugh (Whtye: ""Burt Saxby?"" Bond: ""Yes."" Whyte: ""Tell him he's fired!"") and he actually makes a very good joke. The casting of Jimmy Dean in that role was also inspired and he is surprisingly very believable. The characters of Burt Saxby, Morton Slumber, Shady Tree are all very well cast and stand out enough to make this a memorable film in terms of supporting cast.With that said, it is worth noting that the supporting cast is not perfect. The roles of Felix Lieter and the henchmen Wint and Kidd are underwritten and in the case of Lieter is mis-cast. The characters of Wint and Kidd, like their boss Blofeld, lack menace and are used entirely for comical purposes, shooting bad quips at every given opportunity. Norman Burton is totally unbelievable in the role and the badly written part doesn't help at all.The action in the film reflects the approach of humor and outrageousness. The opening fight in the teaser sequence starts off good, though it is largely tame compared to the fight that started off the previous film. The fight in the elevator stands out as the best action sequence in the film and gives the film a much-needed dose of realism. But the moon buggy chase and car chase are useless as neither one pushes the plot on and are nothing more than attempts to showcase Bond's skills at causing the police and security guards to destroy their cars. The climactic battle on the oil rig is boring, hampered down by terrible effects of exploding helicopters and a pathetic end to the film. The fight that actually ends the film, with Wint and Kidd against Bond, is totally boring and only adds to the overall boredom that is apparent in the film.If there is a bright spot in this film its John Barry's score. The score is never played for laughs and perfectly suits the films Las Vegas location and helps to add some much needed tension to the film, particularly in the climb outside the Whtye House. The score does have its moments of lacking. The music for the Moon Buggy chase is not well suited to the chase and the over use of a action theme that starts in the teaser and goes right trough to the end of the film becomes tiresome. Also, some of the score takes a lot from earlier ones (the Moon Buggy chase sounding like the Gypsy girl fight in From Russia With Love and the music accompanying the various attacks by Blofeld's satellite sounds like the space march from You Only Live Twice). But overall it remains one of the overall best Bond scores with its use of both the James Bond Theme and the 007 theme. With lackluster performances by the major cast, a overall good supporting cast, ridiculous action sequences, and a score that is one of the best in the series, Diamonds Are Forever is a very mixed bag that proves to be better in parts rather than the whole.",Diamonds Are Forever
108,Bogmeister,BOND#7: What Doesn't Stay in Vegas? Bond!,7,2 June 2007,"MASTER PLAN: steal a lot of diamonds to fashion an orbiting super-duper laser to, guess what, blackmail the world! The pre-credits teaser functions as an epilogue to ""On Her Majesty's Secret Service,"" with Bond hunting his arch-nemesis, Blofeld, in a quick series of scenes throughout the world. The filmmakers tried to recapture the best of ""Goldfinger"" in this one, using the same director and singer Bassey on the credits again. Ending up with even a pale imitation of the best Bonder is not such a bad thing, but it also points to the lack of originality besetting the series by this time. This one probably breaks the record for unusual types of killings, mostly courtesy of gay assassins Wint & Kidd, who go through a bunch of victims very quickly early on. The odd flavor and juxtaposition (detail of diamond smuggling over surreal liquidations) is an attempt to make Bond edgy & relevant now that the seventies began. The danger with all the attempts to be unusual, whether in regard to deaths or chases, is that it dips into a cutesy atmosphere a bit too far. Those fans fond of the seriousness in the previous film would probably not be amused, since it comes across as a dark parody of the usual spy stuff. That being said, Wint & Kidd, who represent the worst excesses of this film, end up as the highlights. From their very first scene in the desert, where they seem to draw inspiration from a scorpion, these two oddballs have the audience guessing on what they would do next - they are goofy, yes, but also lethal - interesting because they are somewhat original.Bond's mission, tracking an involved diamond smuggling operation, takes him briefly to Amsterdam, but he ends up in Las Vegas for most of the story. A subplot involves a missing billionaire, obviously patterned after Howard Hughes, who was still living as a recluse at this time. M and, especially Moneypenny, have less screen time in this one, though Q pops up in an amusing scene testing one of his gizmos on some one-armed bandits (Vegas is no match for Q). Though the scenes in Vegas itself are less exotic than those of most Bond films, the film also makes good use of the surrounding desert terrain and there are numerous grand sets, notably a huge futuristic lab building, complete with tests of a fake moon landing, as well as a house built into the rocks. There is a good auto chase on the streets of Vegas, which has the infamous 'two-wheely' by Bond thru an alley. The two weird assassins pop up every now and then; they even have their own theme score, an eerie yet playful little tune. One of them looks very strange (Smith, a jazz musician with no acting experience), while the other (actor Glover, father of Crispin Glover) looks more normal but has very strange inflections to his speech. Every time they show up, a strange tension surfaces for the viewer. Besides Wint & Kidd, other outrageous foes for Bond include Bambi & Thumper, two wild martial arts girls who nearly knock his teeth in. Their scene has a lot of energy and you won't soon forget them. The story is well-paced for the most part, with less of those slow spots that afflicted many of the later Bonders. However, a couple of deleted scenes with the Plenty character makes things a bit confusing for her character arc.Connery is, of course, several years older since his last Bonder, but he looks pretty much the same as he did in ""You Only Live Twice."" There may be a hint of grey around the edges and, in his scenes with M, it no longer comes across as 'the old man and the wiseguy kid' repartee, despite their best efforts. But Bond is still the ideal male here and it's still believable that femme fatale Tiffany falls for him by the end. She's a curious mixture of flaky girl and worldly woman, usually flippant in her approach, sort of reflecting the trivial nature of this Bonder, where nothing happening is really of grave import. That's why, when Blofeld's (him again) real plan is revealed, it's a bit out of left field; all of sudden, we see a super laser detonating missiles around the globe and everything has changed into matters of international import. Blofeld, as played by Gray, is more urbane and effeminate than the previous two versions, more attuned to a villain planning world domination, but he's also too civilized, too polite to Bond in the climactic sequence, diffusing his threatening presence. CIA liaison Leiter recalls the non-descript Leiter of ""Goldfinger,"" as well. The climax on that oil rig sea platform in Baja is not very well done, with Blofeld's end especially disappointing (he would not return, except in the teaser of ""For Your Eyes Only""). But, the epilogue is excellent. Bond, but not Connery, would return in ""Live and Let Die.""

In one scene, Bond gets into a van whilst the van driver is still in it, and the van driver supposedly doesn't notice Bond at all, yet you can literally see the entire van dipping from the weight of Bond getting into the van from the back... in another scene, Bond pulls his arm back so far that he hits a piece of glass and breaks it, which alerts the bad-guy... that's the stupidest thing I've ever seen... Bond is supposed to be a highly trained master of combat, and yet he pulls his arm back right into a piece of glass, like he's in some bloody slap-stick movie from the 1900s? Absolutely ridiculous and it just creates plot-holes all over the place. In another scene, they simply put Bond in a pipe at a construction site and leave him there, until the next bloody day, and he's STILL 'unconscious' in the pipe and then the construction workers bury him in the ground... that's impossible, since you have to ask yourself: ""Who attached the hooks to the piece of pipe that Bond was laying in? How didn't the construction workers see that there's a man inside the pipe, while they were hooking the pipe up to the crane?""... it's all way too unrealistic and creates another plot-hole.If they just didn't include the plot-holes in the movie, then this could easily have been a 7/10 movie, but it just results in being a pretty poor 5/10 movie.",Diamonds Are Forever

Despite Richard Maibaum's literate script (the last to truly 'follow' a Fleming novel), first-time director Peter Hunt's remarkable 'vision', and a performance by novice actor George Lazenby that wasn't nearly as bad as some reviewers at the time would claim, OHMSS was spurned by many Bond fans, and had some critics proclaiming ""Tracy Was Killed, but Bond Is Dead"".While American actor John Gavin had already signed on to make DIAMONDS ARE FOREVER (George Lazenby's inflated ego had gotten the better of him, and he'd managed to get himself 'fired'), Broccoli decided that the franchise needed a major overhaul. Gavin was dropped, Peter Hunt was dropped, and Richard Maibaum's revenge-driven Bond script was rewritten by Tom Mankiewicz into a light-hearted, witty spoof of the earlier 007 films, ignoring his wife's death, and concentrating on gadgets, sex, and superhuman heroics. Veteran director Guy Hamilton, who had guided GOLDFINGER, everyone's favorite Bond movie, was brought back to direct the project...and Broccoli, bowing to pressure from the 007 audience, approached Sean Connery to take the role, one more time.Connery, who had already made four films since his last Bond outing, YOU ONLY LIVE TWICE, hated Broccoli (feeling the producer had 'robbed' him of his share of the profits for the first two Bond films), and loved the leverage he now possessed. When asked about the size of his paycheck to resume the role, he joked, ""I always wanted to own a golf course and a bank...I already own a golf course..."" He also stipulated a hefty fee for each day the production ran over schedule (Lest he seem TOO greedy, much of his salary went to Scottish charities). As a final insult, the actor refused to get into shape for filming, appearing paunchier and grayer than ever (making Broccoli so irate that when he hired Roger Moore for the follow-up, LIVE AND LET DIE, he ordered him, immediately, to ""lose weight and get a haircut!"")Broccoli's instincts proved correct, as the comedy-oriented DIAMONDS ARE FOREVER would become one of 1971's biggest hits. Connery tossed off one-liners with ease, Jill St. John 'channeled' Lucille Ball in her performance as klutzy 'Tiffany Case', and Charles Gray would be sexually ambiguous rather than threatening as Ernst Stavro Blofeld. (His two henchmen would be gay, as well, and so caricatured that the homosexual community would protest the film). Loaded with car chases, fistfights, explosions, and gadgets, Bond 'purists' were appalled by the end product, but a successful new 'formula' had been created, one that would serve Roger Moore very well during his long tenure as 007.And Sean Connery could buy his bank...",Diamonds Are Forever
113,Rickting,The first slip up for James Bond,4,16 August 2015,"In Diamonds Are Forever, James Bond played by a returning Sean Connery who's looking visibly older and visibly fed up of the role goes after some diamond smugglers and Blofeld again. The Bond franchise had been going well until this installment. While a fair distance from some of the horrors of later bad installments, DAF is a campy and flat affair full of bad jokes, poor performances and soulless stunts. Evidently thinking Bond two wheeling through an alley, driving a moon buggy through the desert and spending most of the finale in a crane is exciting, this one lacks the sparkle of the various locations used. DAF is still an escapist movie, boasts the odd thrill and is a bit of a relief after the darkness of On Her Majesty's Secret Service, but a complete lack of any reference to Tracy is pretty annoying. The Bond girl this time is a pretty weak and annoying character. Charles Gray is by far the worst on screen Blofeld although Mr Wint and Mr Kidd are good villains, though underused ultimately.It's entertaining enough and doesn't take itself too seriously. It's hardly a disaster but it is just a bit lifeless. The plot is pleasingly straight forward although the script is a bit silly. The fatal flaw is the campy tone. Similar tonal issues would plague the Roger Moore era. It forgoes tension for not particularly funny humour. When Blofeld turns up again it's no surprise and the finale just isn't as good as it could have been. Everything in DAF is colourful and campy and the grit of Ian Fleming's novels is nowhere to be found. It isn't serious enough to work and while humour is a good thing there's too much of it here. The next installment Live and Let Die managed to reach a better tone. While not the worst in the Bond canon this is one of the weaker entries with the normally reliable Sean Connery completely going through the motions and failing to generate any excitement.

114,grendelkhan,The descent into camp.,6,27 November 2012,"On Her Majesty's Secret Service proved to be a disappointment for EON (though it's one of my favorites) so they backed a truck full of money up to Sean Connery's house and he consented to return. Unfortunately, he had been living the good life and wasn't in great shape; not to mention, his hairpiece was not issued by Q, this time. Where Bond was previously deadly, with the occasional twinkle in his eye, he was now dropping jokes left and right. Don't get me wrong, I enjoy the comic moments in the Bond films, usually, but they are better in small doses.The film teases us with a return to form, as Bond is on a violent rampage to find Bloefeld. At first, we only here him as he assaults one contact after another. Then, we get a glimpse and it takes some of the wind out of the sales. Connery is noticeably older and softer, and his hairpiece isn't very convincing. Had that been a plot point, like in Never Say Never Again, it might not have been a detriment. Unfortunately, you are asked to accept that this is still the same man who fought brutal battles with the likes of Red Grant and Oddjob. That isn't helped when we see him getting his head handed to him by Bambi and Thumper, or having trouble with Wynt and Kidd.The film is played heavily for laughs, but still manages some great stunt sequences, though they are even more outlandish than before, with the car chase through Las Vegas and the moon buggy escape. The final assault on the SPECTRE oil platform returns to the form of YOLT, minus the ninjas.The cast is a bit more odd than in the past, starting with Jill St. John. She is definitely a different love interest, with a wisecracking tongue and more self-assured manner (it was the era of women's lib). Despite that, she really doesn't have much to do, apart from sleeping with Bond and waiting for rescue. Not quite up to Tracy's standards.Charles Grey is a definite poor choice for Bloefeld. He is quite charming and menacing, but Bloefeld has been previously introduced as a cold hearted mass murderer; a calculating killer. Grey has too much of a sense of humor and would have been better suited to play a new villain. The character goes beyond recovery once he appears in drag.As for the rest of the cast, they are pretty forgettable, apart from Jimmy Dean's drawl and Lana Wood's ""presence."" Wynt and Kidd never seem that scary, just weird. It's a shame, as Bruce Glover could have been a real psycho with a better script to work from.The film is pure farce, but at least it's fun. Unfortunately, there was no going back from this formula for years. Even the more serious films, like For Your Eyes Only and Goldeneye, suffer from jokey stunts, with things at their worst under Roger Moore (at least he was at home with the comedy). This one is the one you just kind of watch if thee is nothing better, laughing once in a while, shaking your head once in a while.

His mission is to successfully smuggle diamonds into USA, unaware that Blofeld is behind the scheme.The film is mainly set in Las Vegas but also includes other stunning locations. The reason i feel the 7th 007 movie lets itself down is the weak action. Each film includes something stunning which you remember all the time. The only real memorable sequence from this film is a car chase through Las Vegas, with an unforgivable turn for a car in a narrow alley, which needs to be seen to be believed how bad it looks.Jill St.John plays a good character in Tiffany Case, but does not play Tiffany Case as a good Bond Girl. Her and Bond don't spend enough time together to create that romantic link between the two. She feels more like an allie to Bond rather than his love interest. Jimmy Dean was also perfectly cast as Willard Whyte. He really came across as a high profiled American who likes things to go his way. As the films have gone on, the great character has seemed to decrease in Ernst Blofeld. This time we have the wonderful Charles Gray portraying him, but his talent is put to waste. He should have be on screen more with a menacing tone, instead of dressing up in drag to capture the Bond girl.John Barrys greatness when it comes to soundtracks also seems to be lacking in this addition. Shirley Bassey returns to perform another great piece of theme music, although it won't be as memorable as Goldfinger.Whilst Diamonds Are Forever has many flaws, it is still an enjoyable Bond film to watch, but then again, what Bond film isn't enjoyable to watch.James Bond will return in....

118,jhaggardjr,Hilarious 007 caper,9,2 December 2001,"""Diamonds Are Forever"" is the seventh movie in the popular James Bond 007 series and one of the best. This ingenious comic thriller is lots of fun. This was Sean Connery's last 007 film with Eon Productions, the company co-founded by late producers Albert ""Cubby"" Broccoli and Harry Saltzman (Connery of course reprised the James Bond role 12 years later in ""Never Say Never Again"", which was from different producers and distributor). ""Diamonds Are Forever"" just proves that Connery was and always will be the best James Bond. This movie has the usual elements to be expected in a 007 adventure: over-the-top villains, gorgeous women, helpful sidekicks, inventive gadgets, exhilarating locations, and splendid action. This time out Bond (for the third 007 movie in a row) faces off against the evil, white cat-loving Blofeld (this time portrayed by Charles Gray, after the role was played by Donald Pleasence in ""You Only Live Twice"" and Telly Savalas in ""On Her Majesty's Secret Service"") while investigating mysterious activities in the world diamond market. 007 gets help from a nutty diamond smuggler named Tiffany Case (played in rather nutty fashion by Jill St. John), and Bond's longtime friend Felix Leiter (Normann Burton). ""Diamonds Are Forever"" takes us on a journey that begins in Amsterdam, then heads out to Las Vegas (where the middle portion of the movie is set), then climaxes on an oil rig in the Pacific Ocean. The Las Vegas setting in this movie is quite interesting since the town looked so different 30 years ago compared to today. Connery is great as always. St. John and Gray are fine but come off a bit silly as Bond's main squeeze and archrival, respectively. Lana Wood is good as the other Bond girl Plenty O'Toole, but isn't given much to do considering her very short screen time. Same can be said of current sausage king Jimmy Dean, who plays reclusive billionaire Willard Whyte (owner of the Las Vegas hotel and casino 'The Whyte House'). But Dean just about blows everybody away when he's on screen by giving the funniest, scene stealing performance in the film. Just listing to him talk made me laugh out loud. But that's O.K. It just makes ""Diamonds Are Forever"" all the more better. However, the goofiest roles in the movie go to Bruce Glover and Putter Smith who play those strange oddball assassins Mr. Wint and Mr. Kidd. The usual 007 regulars are here too (Desmond Llewelyn as Q, Bernard Lee as M, and Lois Maxwell as Miss Moneypenny). All this adds up to an exciting and funny action adventure. ""Diamonds Are Forever"" is great fun, no question about it.***1/2 (out of four)",Diamonds Are Forever

For what reason? To depress the price of them? Or to blackmail governments? Bond has to find out.Exotic locations: Holland, Las Vegas (U.S.A).This has to be one of the slenderist justifications to utilise James Bond on a mission. Of course, the decision to use Bond on this mission will be justified, eventually, but really it seems as if the producers had the theme song first and decided to make a movie having something to do with diamonds...just so that they could use the song!Annoyingly, at this point the franchise knows that this spy is a cultural phenomenon, and they really play up to that. His charisma is taken for granted...and even abused...he gets to deliver one liners on a par with that Las Vegas casino comedian he sees (in this movie). Having Bond be a celebrity spy now is a bit of a low point for the franchise...a spy whose reputation precedes them? Is that advisable in the spying business?Sadly, this movie seems to pretend that the last instalment - ""On her majesty's secret service"" - never happened. Sad because not only is it not fit to polish that movie's shoes (!), it is also a rather disappointing effort by Connery's own standards.Bond formula: Pre-title sequence: Desperately seeking Blofeld.Theme song: Shirley Bassey gives Connery a great farewell with this classic.Q: A staple in the series by now.Silly female names: Tiffany Case (get it?)...I do like Bond's comments to her on whether he prefers blondes or brunettes...he doesn't mind ""provided the collars and cuffs match""! Plenty O'Toole! Misogyny: In the pre-title sequence Bond strikes a woman...but then again this can be read as Bond being a non-discriminatory user of force on people who don't co-operate with his questioning. He also slaps another woman later on in the movie. Pretty much a staple part of the Connery years. As a flipside to this, I think that gay men might take offence to the dated representation of them...which is why I put in my review title ""Carry on up the Khyber"".Wine jibber-jabber: God yes. Bond 'exceeds' himself this time! Hint: never bring wine to Bond's house...End teaser: Yes.Things to look out for: * Bond has apparently been on ""holiday""...kind of explaining the gap since we last saw Connery in the role. This has the unfortunate side effect of making it seem like the greatest entry in the Bond franchise (""On her majesty's secret service"") never happened.* After having a very narky relationship with Q, things get really narky with M now, following on from ""On her majesty's secret service"" it seems.* Tiffany Case knowing who James Bond is...and 'Peter Franks' too...MI6 would surely be smart enough to redeploy Bond at this point, you'd think! * Are we up to three different actors who have played Blofeld by this point? He must have some plastic surgeon!* Some wooden American characters.* Moments that are just too 'cute'...like the scene with the elephant in the casino. Groan.* Bambi and Thumper are two terrific characters...wonder why they don't get mentioned more in relation to this series.* Bond is a bit of smart-arse in this movie...the producers are just getting to smug for my liking here.* Bond has trouble operating a crane...finally, SOMETHING that Bond has trouble with! * Tiffany 'shrieking' ""Ee!"" near the end of the movie. Looks like she's just seen a spider...across the room! * Mr. Wint enjoying being taken from behind by Bond at the end of the movie.",Diamonds Are Forever
120,willcundallreview,A more tame Bond,7,3 March 2014,"Rating-7/10Diamonds are Forever is in my opinion one of the best examples of what Bond is, with sophistication and some great action like moves he glides along does Bond and with Sean Connery returning slightly older, her still knows how to stop the world's worst. A fun film that is also slightly funny at times and I felt it was strongly a kind of good film and here below is why I felt that about Diamonds Are Forever.The story is fun and set mostly in the USA and when he is Las Vegas it works really well as Bond get's to show off his charm even more among the numerous bars and casino's there. I like the pace as it is slightly slower than Connery's previous outings but still churns out a good story and great villains all who make the film even more fun. I also loved the stunts as they are ridiculous but they also work with this film and make it much more fun and exciting to watch.Connery is back and his job in this is a firm one albeit he is very old I this to portray the kind of Bond he is trying to show. The Bond girl is Jill St. John and she is probably the most feisty Bond girl there is and seems to object to everything Bond does in the film. I loved the villains and not Just Blofeld(Charles Gray) but also Wint and Mr Kidd who play two of the most villainous Bond villains ever and are possibly the most calm yet sadistic movie villains in any film ever.The script and direction are average and to be fair are the same typical type of things we expect to see from Bond in his earlier showings. I loved the action sequences and well although Bond may take a slight back seat with the action he still manages to get in some great stunts and some good fight sequences that are we choreographed. One stunt you will see, I won't give it away, but it involves a car and Bond makes it do a certain thing which is well, well it must be near impossible but you will see.The movie can be slow at times and you can even feel it is becoming stale at parts but it manages to hold up enough not too. I said before he sits back on the action and he does very much so, maybe Connery didn't want as much action as he was older but he seems to get by with little action, although I did feel it did well even without the bags of action we usually see. Another criticism would be the apparent Homophobia in where the villains are seen as a Homosexual couple and it is sometimes thought that because of there sexuality they are evil, it is never confirmed and should do little to offend.Any Bond fan should like this as it show's off exactly what I feel Bond is known for, but also show's a more reserved Bond who studies the situation much better than in every other film. If you like a good crime spy adventure then this if or you too, it had gadgets, action and the fun criminals involved too, most should enjoy this as it can be very rewarding and fun.I give it a 7/10 meaning a strongly a kind of good film, I felt maybe I overrated it after but hey it is a fun film and can be thoroughly enjoyed as well. When you watch just don't think about the plot and enjoy the quick snappy humour of Connery in his last Eon produced Bond role, in the truth the end of one of the best Bond's, and many consider him the best of all of them.",Diamonds Are Forever
121,majikstl,"""They can stimulate and tease me.""",8,15 June 2006,"You don't review James Bond movies, you evaluate them, rate them according to how well they meet expectations. There are certain things one has come to expect, even demand of a Bond film and each individual effort either delivers or it doesn't. So, here are ten elements that make a Bond film a Bond film and how DIAMONDS ARE FOREVER rates on a scale of 1 to 10: Title: DIAMONDS ARE FOREVER: A slight perversion of the once popular ad line used to sell wedding rings, this title suggests romance, but certainly that is the last thing on the film's agenda. It's a wonderfully deceptive title. 10 points.Pre-Credit Teaser: Bond ""kills"" Blofeld, which supposedly seems to tie up major loose ends from ON HER MAJESTY'S SECRET SERVICE. But considering that when last we saw him, Blofeld was murdering James' new bride, such a confrontation should have immense power. An important turning point in the series slips past with no acknowledgment. Though the opening does serve to show that Sean Connery is back and George Lazenby has been released from Bondage. 2 points.Opening Credits: Maurice Binder's style of opening montage is wearing just a tad old and predictable. Pretty enough with its diamond-studded theme for 4 points, but not good enough to do justice to the: Theme Song: It is said that originally the film was to be a followup to GOLDFINGER, with his brother taking up where Goldfinger left off. That never came off, but certainly ""Diamonds are Forever"" is a perfect companion piece to the earlier theme song. It, of course, has the fabulous Shirley Bassey doing the vocals again, but it also repeats the cynicism of applying sensuous lust to material wealth. It's an anti-love song, much like ""Diamonds are a Girl's Best Friend,"" only it doesn't hide its hard-edged avarice under a bouncy tune. It is, I think, even better than ""Goldfinger,"" and may be the prefect James Bond song: amoral, stylish and seductive. 10 points ""Bond, James Bond"": Connery is back, a bit chunkier and a tad grayer, but apparently his extended vacation from the role of 007 paid off. Personally, I think this is his best Bond work as Sean strolls through the film with relaxed charm and a complete understanding that this film, if not the entire series, is a comedy. Bond purists tend to disregard DIAMONDS ARE FOREVER because of its flip attitude, but that is what makes it my favorite. 10 points.Bond Babes: Lana Wood, Natalie's sister, is on hand as the mandatory eye candy, and is all-too-disposable as Plenty O'Toole. But someone had the bright idea of making the main Bond Girl someone with a flair for comedy. Enter maturing starlet Jill St. John, the epitome of 1960's cheesy, Playboy sexuality. Whatever her limitations as an actress, St. John certainly had the knack for using her sexuality as an amusing toy and still maintain the edge that she is a lot smarter than she looks. As Tiffany Case, her intelligence seems to diminish as the film wears on (it seems the women Bond beds all end up dead or dumb), but her ability to fill a bikini remains indisputable. 9 points.Bond Villain: Ernst Stavro Blofeld is back again, though only his love of fluffy, white pussycats remains constant. The intense geek of Donald Peasence and the uncouth thug of Telly Savalas are replaced by Charles Gray, who opts to play the part with droll, bemused wit and -- radically -- a full head of hair. Gray never gained iconic stature as Blofeld (that would come later as the Blofeld-like narrator in THE ROCKY HORROR PICTURE SHOW), but for my money he is the best Blofeld, a villain of classy arrogance who is singularly unimpressed by Bond. 10 points.Bond Baddies: Ah yes, Mr. Kidd and Mr. Wint; as played by Putter Smith and Bruce Glover, they are the Chip and Dale of Bond assassins; two more gracious and well-mannered killers would be hard to find. The film has been accused of homophobia for including a pair of gay killers, but considering the sheer number of assassins to cross Bond's path, it would be more discriminatory to exclude them based on their orientation. Wint and Kidd are at once gay clichés and yet surprisingly non-stereotypical. Nonetheless, they glide (prance? skip?) through the film with cold-blooded assurance and a rather endearing affection. And if they aren't butch enough, there's always Bambi and Thumper (Lola Larson and Trina Parks) on hand to beat the tar out of James. 9 points.Plot: Blofeld hopes to corner the diamond market to use them on some sort of outer space laser with which he can -- again -- hold the nations of the world for ransom. Doesn't this guy ever learn? They even do the ""you've killed James Bond"" bit again. 5 points.Production values: Bond's globetrotting brings him to the glitz and pseudo-grandeur of Las Vegas in all of its tacky glory. It makes for a nicely surrealistic backdrop, appropriate for the film's self-mocking attitude -- though a major chase scene is marred by the large number of tourists standing along the route, watching the filming. 7 points.Bonus Points: The Bond producers' love of unorthodox casting pays off with the selection of country singer and sausage maker Jimmy Dean as the reclusive millionaire based on Howard Hughes. It is such a bizarre choice, yet Dean's country boy charm is a wonderful contrast to both Hughes' nutty behavior and to the bemused sophistication of Bond. 5 points.Summary: DIAMONDS ARE FOREVER is a turning point in the series; the gritty, pseudo-realism of the early films is gone in favor of slick comic book sci-fi gloss. Whatever the series loses in thrills it makes up for in fun. Bond-o-meter Rating: 81 points out of 100.",Diamonds Are Forever
122,michaelarmer,"Sean ""4 Shags"" Connery is Back",8,22 March 2020,"After a dispute over the last film, and then problems with the new Bond George Lazonby, Sean Connery returns, not that much had changed anyway, despite the problems Lazonby did a good job in his one film, and Connery plays his usual Bond style, so no change there.It is a well made film with plenty of good action, the moon buggy chase is good, some mistakes, particularly when the oil rig is being attacked and some scenes were missing which would have made it better, the authentic scenes of Las Vegas, other parts of the US and Amsterdam are well used and make it much better than fake locations.Of the other actors, Charles Gray (returning, he played a different character in 'You Only Live Twice') and Jill St. John are the best, Jill doing an excellent turn as a confident, brash but a bit ditzy American woman, but very sexy. Jimmy Dean as Willard Whyte is an inspiration and Bruce Cabot, who usually does a good turn, is good as Bert Saxby, the Henchmen/Women are also good, particularly Putter Smith and Bruce Glover doing their ""Gay married couple"" act to perfection. Norman Burton does a poor Felix Leiter, but he did not get many scenes. Lola Larson and Trina Parks played Bambi and Thumper OK and Peter Robinson a Wrestler and Judo expert as Peter Franks all made good fight scenes with Bond better.The usual Bond themes are all there, and some that were missing in OHMSS are back :- Live Action Start, Silhouette Titles, Theme Song, Casino Scene, M, Q and Moneypenny, Fancy Cars (well just one, a Ford Mustang, no Aston Martin), Henchmen = 4 in this one, 2 gay pals and 2 athletic women, SPECTRE and Felix Leiter. Shirley Bassey is brought back for the Title song, and what a Song, the best of all, just slightly shading her Goldfinger song, in fact all 3 of her songs are the best, Moonraker being the least best but still better than all the rest.Of the ""Bond Girls :- Only 1 in this movie (must be his age) is Tiffany Case (no.23) played by Jill St. John an American, is great, not the best looking, but not far off, and she has a great body. The other notable is Plenty O'Toole played by Lana Wood, almost as sexy as Tiffany, but Bond did not get to shag her, and she got killed after so I don't count it. Apparently Connery did shag her in real life, he had both of them whilst still married to Diane Cilento!Despite a few obvious mistakes, overall very good and one of my favourites. I only gave it 8 because of the mistakes and missing scenes, otherwise it would have got 9",Diamonds Are Forever
123,malkane316,Quick Reviews!!,6,14 February 2005,"What should have been the end of Blofeld, and therefore a satisfying film, ends up being merely entertaining, with too much emphasis on humour which does not suit Connery's style. Bond is chasing down leads for Blofeld and eventually finds him. The film flies around the globe, coming to a conclusion on a massive ship, but the film seems hollow. Diamonds, right? Jill St John's character is annoying, Grey is weak as Blofeld, and the only interesting characters are Plenty, and Mr Wint and Mr Kidd, who prove to be memorable. Those two assassins earn their place as infamous Bond villains, and the final scene involving them, Bond, and a cake is very funny. Blofeld's supposed death is dark but seems pathetic after everything he has done. There are plenty of stunts, but it is clear here that the series needed a fresh approach.6 out of 10.",Diamonds Are Forever
124,theshadow908,Kind of goofy,6,30 January 2007,"Sean Connery returns in the 7th installment to the super spy series. This film begins with James Bond killing Blofeld in revenge for the death of his wife in the last film. After that is accomplished, Bond is put on a diamond smuggling case where he meets the beautiful Tiffany Case, a woman involved with the operation. As the mission goes on, James Bond discovers that he killed a Blofeld double, and the leader of SPECTRE is planning to use the diamonds to power a weapon that can incinerate military equipment from space. Now Bond is determined to stop Blofeld once and for all. It's nice to see Sean Connery return, but he doesn't seem that into any more.On Her Majesty's Secret Service was the first bad Bond movie in my opinion, and part of why that movie was bad was George Lazenby's weak performance. You'd think that with Sean Connery returning to the role, this movie would be better. Unfortunately, since his last go as Bond in 1967, he has visibly aged. He's got graying hair, crow's feet, and he's a bit chubbier. This Bond film takes a turn away from serious espionage and tries to add more slapstick comedy and fun action scenes. One example is a terrible scene where Bond gets away from the bad guys in a moon rover, or during the climax when he uses an escape pod containing Blofeld as a wrecking ball. The terrible characters of Wint and Kidd are in here, and their annoying conversations make one want to hit the Fast Forward button. Blofeld is terrible in this movie. When he first appeared in From Russia With Love when he first appeared, he was sinister, certainly a force to be reckoned with. He lost a lot of his evil in On Her Majesty's Secret Service, and in this movie he actually dresses up in drag to trap Tiffany Case, something the original Blofeld would never do. The dialogue is cornier than any other Bond film so far, and so are the action scenes.The acting isn't very good. Charles Gray is a terrible Blofeld, and Jill St. John doesn't make a very good Bond girl. Sean Connery is okay I guess, but it seems like his heart's not in the role anymore.Overall, this is a dumbly entertaining action film, but as a Bond film, it's not that great.5.5/10",Diamonds Are Forever
125,Didier-Becu,DIAMONDS ARE FOREVER (DIDIER BECU),5,30 March 2004,"Guy Hamilton certainly is one of the most talented Bond-directors and once again this one is a watchable Bondmovie in where you forget all the dated innovations (if you see them now in 2004 they are rather laughable). But good for the last time Connery played his Bondtype (if you don't count ""Never say never again"") he did it with style and sadly enough it would be the start of a new series starring Lazenby and Moore. The plot is rather stupid...Bond is send out to find a thief (Blofeld) who steals diamonds and they're not for any present for any lady but they control some satelittes that give power over the whole world. Before all that, James Bond must witness some other adventures at where he is helped by Jill St John, perhaps one of the least attractive Bondgirls ever.It's clear that if you hate Bond you absolutely will see it as a waste of time but in case you like it, don't forget it's one of the better ones.",Diamonds Are Forever

This movie is Sean Connery at some of his funniest and coolest moments- but of course- this movie is smart enough to have fun with itself- it's really a great ride if you dig the 70s style of movies and long for those years compared to the super retarded shite that is churned out regularly by Hollywood lately.Oh, and let me APPLAUD the coffin scene- utterly superb.",Diamonds Are Forever

128,OttoVonB,"Bond 7: Diamonds Are Forever, But Connery's Goodwill is Running Out",5,11 June 2007,"After his wife is killed (see the previous film), Bond (Connery again) goes on a vendetta to find his nemesis, SPECTER head Blofield. The plot goes on to cover diamond smuggling, an oil-rig base, a fair dose of violence, and the lamest Bond girl so far.Called in after Lazenby underwhelmed audiences in On Her Majesty's Service, Connery, outfitted with a horrific toupee, reprises the role of 007 for one last film. Unlike Moore, who in A View To A KIll was undone by looking too old, Connery is still physically acceptable, but has another somewhat less forgivable flaw: he makes no effort to hide his complete lack of enjoyment or involvement. This is obviously one for the paycheck, and the fun, callous Bond of episodes 1 to 6 is replaced by a cold an cynical bastard few will recognize as 007.Diamonds also puts all its gusto into its wild prologue, while denying us any thrill for the rest of the film. Even the legendary song will try your patience.This film actually makes you yearn for the Roger Moore era, and seeing how enjoyable his first three stabs at Bond are, it might be better to skip Diamonds are Forever altogether!",Diamonds Are Forever
129,tforbes-2,"Sophisticated, stylish romp",10,26 July 2003,"Many people are apparently put off by this Bond film. Sure, Sean Connery is older, you see Blofeld (this time with a head of hair) and the series seemed a tad out of place in 1971, when the anti-war movement was running strong.This movie is not Goldfinger, despite the presence of Guy Hamilton at the helm and Shirley Bassey as the singer of the title theme. What this movie is is a stylish romp that seems to bear some nod to the Batman TV series in terms of style. In some other respects, this movie plays almost like an Anglicized version of ""The FBI,"" or like ""The Persuaders.""And that is not at all bad! The original femme fatale of the 1966 Batman series, Jill St. John, is the female lead here, and is fun to watch. She shows a lot of spirit in the role. Charles Grey is fun to watch as Blofeld, because he brings a real wit to the role. The dialogue is definitely sophisticated, and it is a very stylish production that I think holds up well. And Lana Wood does a fine job here, too! (Oh, and I met her in Detroit in May 2009; sweet lady!!)This movie is also more daring in terms of sex than any other Bond: The public display of affection the thugs Wint and Kidd show, as well as the topless scene of Lana Wood's character.Gadgets don't seem to dominate this outing. It's no 1960s Connery film (the lead actor's older), nor a 1970s Moore outing (more serious). This movie is sandwiched between the two eras, and it rightly should be taken on its own terms. Which means, I think it is one of the most enjoyable Bond films made--a sophisticated, stylish romp. It is, in my view, a most enjoyable Bond (and my personal favourite)!",Diamonds Are Forever

And Sean Connery was worth every cent. the movie picks up where On her Majesty's secret service left off. Bond is hunting Blofeld and when he finds him he murders him. His vendetta done Bond returns home and is given a assignment involving Diamond smugglers. But since this is a mission for 007 nothing is as it seems. The Diamonds are pursued by two homosexual killers Wint and Kidd who are two of the most memorable characters in the movie. When Bond tracks the diamonds down to a smuggler name Tiffany Case things heat up. Tiffany has been targeted for death and Bond saves her only to find the whole thing goes much deeper. Blofeld is back from the dead for one thing. And a mysterious billionaire named Willard whyte is involved somehow. The film while not the best written Bond benefits from it;s strengths which is mainly Connery as Bond. It's a good sound action flick which goes well with a bowl of popcorn and the lights dimmed.

131,mnpollio,The worst of the Connery offerings,2,23 March 2007,"Hands down the worst of the Connery Bonds. After the dismal efforts of George Lazenby, producers ponied up and returned Connery to the fold for one last go at the role. Almost nothing works in this dreary entry which plays more like a low-rent heist caper on an episode of Starsky & Hutch than a big screen spy caper. The majority of the action takes place in Las Vegas, which was hardly an exotic locale even in the 1970s.Bond: The good news is Connery is back and Lazenby is gone. The bad news is that Connery is on total auto-pilot in this film. He is so obviously filled with disdain for the part at this junction that one almost wishes he had not agreed to return for this entry.The villains: Charles Gray is the third actor in a row to attempt to do something with the thankless Ernst Blofeld role and (as with his predecessors) fails miserably. Thankfully this would be the last time that Blofeld would be used as the main Bond nemesis. The less said about Mr. Wint and Mr. Kidd, who play like rejected villains from a bad Batman episode, the better.The women: Jill St. John makes a strong first impression as the tough-as-nails Tiffany Case, then her character does an about-face. By the final act, she is a typical bikini-clad bimbo acting as though she does not have a brain in her head and becoming more an obstruction to Bond rather than an equal or an assistant. And I have yet to figure out what Lana Wood and her copious cleavage are supposed to be in this film. Did the majority of her role land on the cutting room floor or something? It literally makes no sense.By the time Jimmy Dean shows up with ""Bambi & Thumper"" even the most die-hard Bond fan will want to tune out.",Diamonds Are Forever

It was fun, well acted but the story/writing werent on point here",Diamonds Are Forever
133,EvanKevelson,Connery is back but begrudgingly,6,26 February 2021,"Personally when I rate a Bond Film a rate it only in the context of all Bond Films pre-Daniel Craig (being he is a reboot not a continuity Bond). These aren't deep message films they are action films based on a covert MI-6 agent whose missions are to infiltrate, gather Intel and kill when necessary. The Rating also has to be looked at From a historical perspective not only factually but sociological norms of that particular era.
So if I see a review that depicts racism(lack of black characters) or depiction of Connery or Moore as a sick misogynistic animal... I know the reviewer is ignorant of what audiences where pleased by between 1962-1977 etc... They also are just as fanatic in liberal ideology as a religious conservative fanatics. These were till 1973 ""Guy Films"" not date films.
Criticizing Bond on a ""morality"" basis is the same as criticizing looney tunes for excessive violence. It's moronic
Sean Connery didn't handle the seventies and eighties well and didn't really resurface until ""The Hunt For Red October"" Physically just not made for the role explaining the downgrade of physicality to a fight in an elevator, and a rope climb to a Willard White/Blowfeld suite.
Great start, after ""Her majesty's Secret Service"" the murder of Bond's wife... Sir Connery is on an obsessive hunt for Blowfeld. (Didn't quite convince me that he killed the real Blowfeld in the opening sequence it was just too easy).
I felt the film definitely made it clear to audiences that outside of his wit he was not the Bond of 1964-67 and this would be his final appearance in the official franchise.
The cast surrounding him allowed this film to flourish. Despite Blowfeld having been a different character in ""You Only Live Twice"" and ""Her Majesty's Secret Service"" I did not like that Blowfeld had hair... It just didn't feel right.
Of course Bond knows his burgundy barrel castings and vintages (1851 or was it cherri)?
This entire film was close to being a spoof on all his previous Bond appearances. Connery was more like a dirty sugar daddy saving the day with a cassette hidden in his daughters bikini bottom.
Plus your homosexual homicidal lunatic scenes and their dialogue was simply hysterical and very enjoyable. His age clearly scene as he takes a true whooping from two very athletic limber females.
An anti nuclear theme but not invoking Cold War paranoia.
A throwback ending to ""From Russia With Love"" with a ridiculous hotel room service last attempt.
It did change the tone for the next Bond fixture who was more slick and suave than the Alpha tough guy the franchise was built on.",Diamonds Are Forever
134,dasa108,A decline in quality in relation to previous films,5,28 August 2021,"Sean Connery looks tired and wrinkled. In this film he lost part of the spark that his character had in the early films. Not only that, it is far worse than the Lazemby film ... Guy Hamilton, the director, does not offer a careful job but gives us a regular, ordinary job that does not stand up to comparison with the exceptional sequences of previous films. The difference is dramatic. The mania to change the protagonist of the main villain remains unclear, who is very unintelligent to be someone who puts the world at risk. The story is weak and there is no dramatic content or unforgettable moments like the Lazemby film, in my humble opinion, the best of the Bond saga so far.",Diamonds Are Forever

It seems to be the first of a trio of films, in fact, with the other two being ""Live and Let Die"" and ""The Man With the Golden Gun.""  These three installments not only have the same emphasis on humor, but have conclusions that are almost interchangeable.  In ""Diamonds,"" the story is all but wrapped up when Bond and the lovely Tiffany Case (the beautiful Jill St. John) are aboard an ocean liner where they are confronted by the two stereotyped homosexual assassins for a final burst of action.  In ""Live and Let Die,"" there is a similar wrap-up on a train, and in ""Man With the Golden Gun,"" another similar scene takes place, again, on an ocean liner.  There is very little memorable about ""Diamonds Are Forever""--it represents a major decline from ""On Her Majesty's Secret Service""--yet it has Connery, another terrific John Barry score, and, like I said, the beautiful Jill St. John.

Yeah, I'm not going to be too subtle about this, I am really not a big fan of this particular entry in the series. It ranks up there with ""Die Another Day"" as one of the absolute low- points of the series. The plot is pretty boring and un-involving, Jill St. John is absolutely irritating as Tiffany Case, Charles Gray feels completely miscast as Blofeld, and the Las Vegas setting is pretty drab despite it's overload of glitter. The whole thing feels more like a big budget Saturday-morning cartoon and most of the action sequences are a complete joke. The only action sequence that is sincerely great is the elevator fight. But worst of all is Connery's completely indifferent and charmless final performance in the official 007 movie cannon. What a way to go!! Regardless, some shining spots can be found on this crappy diamond. Mr. Kidd and Mr. Wint are a great villainous pair and the actors knock it out of the park, preventing this film from completely falling flat in the villain department. There are also some sincerely funny moments of witty dialogue (Right idea Mr. Bond, but wrong pussy).

138,TheHande,A fun film...,7,11 December 2007,"Sean Connery's final Bond movie may not be his greatest, but it is certainly very entertaining. Because Connery is an actor who's improved as an actor the older he gets he still has a great deal of gravitas in his final official Bond-outing, unlike his follower Roger Moore.The film's plot is intriguing and fairly well written. The narrative moves at a nice pace. Action and dialogue are used in even intervals to make the movie flow naturally. The comedy is also not as cheesy as in most Bond films but it's really up to the viewer what sort of attitude they take to the film's comedic and gag moments. From a production side of things the film is quite excellent. Unfortunately the film has very much settled into a traditional James Bong-formula. The structure is rather predictable even if the variety of action keeps the film from becoming boring. Overall the film fails to achieve a serious tone and more or less caters to the needs of the early 70s Bond audiences which unfortunately means the plot loses any sort of serious weight.However, despite its predictability, Diamonds are Forever is a fun and even a slightly self-parodying experience and definitely an entertaining movie.",Diamonds Are Forever
139,antagonist117,Bond is British as ever among American co-stars in a solid but fraught script,5,15 July 2013,"The ""Diamonds"" script trades on British and American stereotypes to good effect. Bond survives the transition to the 1970s without abandoning his aristocratic bearing: he doubles down on the wine scenes in ""Goldfinger"" by identifying the year of a sherry. The supporting cast, on the other hand, is dominated by plain-spoken, even hick-ish Americans, and the contrasting textures work. The CIA throws around American football terms, Grand Ole Opry performer Jimmy Dean plays a thickly-accented southern millionaire, and Jill St. John is the first Bond girl to hail from the States. The Las Vegas setting doesn't click as well as the actors, lacking as it does the beauty and class of previous Bond locales like Venice, Istanbul, and the Swiss Alps. Ken Adam's wide, low, modernistic sets are in especially fine form this time around, however. There is a lot of humor in the script, yet the plot is a low-stakes rehash of the one in ""From Russia With Love,"" ""Thunderball,"" and ""You Only Live Twice."" A pair of killer gymnasts, Bambi and Thumper, are strange and amusing, but the film's other assassin duo is the more remarkable. Bruce Glover and Putter Smith are charismatic as Mr. Wint and Mr. Kidd, but unfortunately they minstrel as a gay couple, making them among the franchise's most fraught figures.",Diamonds Are Forever

I was always puzzled about the scene when Tiffany Case/Jill St. John finds Bond by the pool at her house and sees Plenty dead and anchored to a cement block in the pool. Bond tells her that Wint and Kidd must have thought that Plenty was Tiffany and murdered her by mistake (a horrific kind of death that was not filmed). The last Plenty was seen before this moment was her being tossed out the hotel window by the mobsters so how did she know who Tiffany was and how did she know where she lived? In a deleted scene, Plenty soaking wet in a towel returns to Bond's hotel room and goes through Tiffany's handbag and looks at her ID. This was a bad editing decision. I've read about another scene that has Plenty breaking into Tiffany's house and trying on her wigs when Wint and Kidd show up. This explains why Tiffany asks Bond why her wig is in the pool before she sees Plenty's body.",Diamonds Are Forever

142,rparham,"Not exactly a ""Diamond"" in the rough",6,13 November 2006,"After George Lazenby coughed up one turn in the role of James Bond, the producers managed to woo Sean Connery back to part one last time (sort of) in Diamonds are Forever. However, unfortunately Connery's send off isn't his strongest. Diamonds are Forever is, along with You Only Live Twice and On Her Majesty's Secret Service, a serviceable, but not spectacular, Bond film. It is entertaining at times, but also feels weak and worn occasionally, not really rising above the average.Diamonds are Forever finds 007 tracking down Ernst Stavro Blofeld (Charles Gray, the third, and ostensibly final, actor to play the part) to exact revenge for the death of his wife at the end of On Her Majesty's Secret Service. After taking care of that business, he is given a new assignment: crack a diamond smuggling ring that is transporting diamonds from Africa to America. Time is of the essence, as the various members of the ring are being killed off one by one, and Bond must try to infiltrate the operation before it completely shuts down. He takes the identity of one of the smugglers and meets up with Tiffany Case (Jill St. John), one of the last stops on the trail and ends up transporting the diamonds to Las Vegas, where it appears the smuggling has been orchestrated by the reclusive millionaire Willard Whyte (Jimmy Dean) who plans to use the diamonds in a orbital device that will allow him to hold the world hostage.Diamonds are Forever does benefit from the bonus of having Connery back in the role after sitting On Her Majesty's Secret Service out, and he is in decent form as Bond, with plenty of snappy one liners to deliver with his usual deft charm, but by this point the Bond series had begun a slide into a realm of self-mockery that would become disastrous in a few more films, and while Diamonds are Forever is a still serious enough to have some weight to it, you can see the start of a bad trend for the Bond films. The Bond girl here, Tiffany Case, is a bit of ditz as well, not really up to the level of some of the classics. St. John is somewhat memorable in the role, her performance isn't bad, but the character as a whole is relatively lower grade compared to Tracy or Pussy Galore.Diamonds are Forever also features relatively little in the way of standout action. Sure, there are some chases and fight scenes, but nothing to really take your breath away. It is all rather pedestrian stuff, hardly capable of quickening your pulse. Diamonds are Forever does feature some entertaining henchmen in the form of Mr. Kidd (Putter Smith) and Mr. Wynt (Bruce Glover) who prove to be amusing when on screen, although nowhere near as intimidating and Oddjob or Fiona Volpe. Villain-wise, Charles Grey is not the strongest Blofeld of the series, Pleasance was still the best, so you hardly feel much dislike for him.When James Bond is at its best, it can prove to be an enormously entertaining romp. Here, when it seems to just be going through the motions and not really hitting any high notes, it can serve as a mildly entertaining lark, but nothing too memorable. Connery's last ""official"" appearance as the character ends up just producing an ""Eh.""",Diamonds Are Forever

144,HelloTexas11,Connery's sly goodbye,7,21 January 2008,"Sean Connery's last go-round in the initial James Bond series is a quirky entry that I find one of the most enjoyable. It keeps all of the trappings and recurrent characters we had come to expect in a 007 film but adds a few novel twists which keep things from becoming stale. Connery's co-star and female lead this time is Jill St. John and forgive me while I drool on my keyboard a moment. The term 'drop dead gorgeous' must have been invented for her and maybe even specifically for this movie. Casual nudity in mainstream cinema was not yet commonplace, but some of Ms. St. John's 'costumes' come about as close as is possible. As Bond aptly puts it shortly after meeting her character, Tiffany Case, ""that's a nice little nothing you're almost wearing."" Bond has a number of great one-liners in 'Diamonds Are Forever,' and Connery delivers them in a breezy, laid-back performance. The diamonds in question are to be used on a satellite to focus a laser beam that will destroy nuclear weapons, allowing SPECTRE to blackmail various governments. Yeah, that old plot again. But it's just enough to hang a number of funny and exciting scenes on, starting in Holland and ending up in Las Vegas. Maybe the oddest aspect of 'Diamonds Are Forever' is the inclusion of two openly and sometimes outlandishly gay characters, Mr. Wint and Mr. Kidd. They are operatives/assassins in the employ of SPECTRE and appear at crucial times throughout the film... always together. The plot sometimes veers off into extreme silliness (it's hard to recall a chase scene sillier than the one with Bond in the moon-buggy) and the special effects range from believable to incredibly cheesy (the shot of Chinese missiles being destroyed and a flaming Chinese soldier crossing the screen has to be seen to be believed) which, along with the above-mentioned aspects, seem to indicate the series was heading in a more comedic direction just as Connery was making his exit. Whether this was an improvement is debatable, but Connery was, and is, the definitive Bond and 'Diamonds Are Forever' stands as one of the best 007 films.",Diamonds Are Forever
145,BumpyRide,More Pork Than A Jimmy Dean Sausage,4,19 August 2005,"Coming off the fantastic ""On Her Majesty's Secret Service"" we get an old, bloated out of shape Sean Connery just going through his familiar moves. This movie is a farce and rivals even some of Roger Moore's stinkeroonies. The opening scene lacks any kind of imagination. I will give credit for Shady Tree trying to cremate Bond in the crematory. You truly wonder how he's going to get out of this one. But the movie falls flat. Jill St. John giggles and shakes throughout and shows us why she's never been nominated for an Oscar. The car chase scene is long and boring with the director reversing the film we've already seen to build up the running time of the film. I won't even comment on the absurd moon buggy chase or the annoying characters sprinkled throughout or Blofeld dressed as a drag queen. One doesn't think of Jimmy Dean the sausage King, when one thinks of Bond. At least I don't. I guess he was a fan of the series and pulled some strings to get cast.

Mr. Connery is still great (with a different toupee, no doubt) and Charles Grey is excellent as his nemesis.  Jill St. John is gorgeous as always, although in the 1960's she was hotter.  Lana Wood in a small role as the none-too-bright Plenty O'Toole showed off her body to good advantage and was quite funny.This is still a 5 out of 10.  Best performance = Charles Grey.  Sausage King Jimmy Dean has sly humor as a Howard Hughes-type and Bambi and Thumper are fetching hit-women.

147,David_Frames,They lustre on...,5,31 July 2003,"With a title song thats basic premise is that men are bad and women therefore are better off being materialist gold diggers, Diamonds are Forever immediately forsakes all common sense for flimsy fantasy and some disturbing Disney references. With George Lazenby used to test the scene in which in Bond undergoes a living cremation, Connery was back only now looking slightly older and larger around the midriff. Not American enough for its American funding partners at United Artists, Bond was, prior to the Scots' resigning in the lead role, to be more Stateside friendly than before which at one point may have meant an American Bond in addition to US locations and supporting cast. The Vegas setting survived and with the horror of a serious and rather good adventure still repeating on Bond producers, Jokes and japery take over at the expense of any attempt at realism. Its like before only with a great deal less lustre than the titular stones. Therefore comic villains Mr.Wink and Mr.Kidd bugger about dispatching minor players, Bond gets involved in a frankly ludicrous plot involving Blofeld, dopplegangers and a world takeover plot so weak that the laser involved is controlled by what looks like a 90 minute TDK cassette which Bond shoves down Plenty's underwear. Blofeld losing his touch? You better believe it.Dull, unimaginative and packed with cut price production values (goodbye volcano, hello an old clapped out oil rig), the seventies had arrived for the Bond series and the lightness of touch evident here was to shape the Moore era that followed. Not so much the edgy thrillers of yesteryear, more Carry On James with some jokes that would have embarrassed Kenneth Williams.Poor.",Diamonds Are Forever

He seems like he created the character and his acting was impeccable.The Bond girl was weird though, but she was cute and up to the standards.The movie is funny, Sean looks amused and quite relaxed in traveling between Amsterdam and Las Vegas to investigate about a diamond illegal traffic.The film is a kind of remake of ""Goldfinger"" -there is Sean, of course; director Guy Hamilton; Shirley Bassey sings the theme; the story takes place in America; here too we have glamorous elements (diamonds instead of gold).",Diamonds Are Forever
149,MF210,"As Underwhelming as it maybe, It is still Bond",6,21 January 2004,"My Rating: **1/2 out of ****. Diamonds Are Forever is notable for a couple of things: 1) The huge salary Sean Connery received to comeback. 2) It was Sean Connery's last bond (unless you count Never Say Never Again). 3) Many fans think it is one of the worst Bond films. As a Bond Fan, I am somewhat mixed about the film. There are times when it is good. However, there are times when its annoying and bad. As a separate Bond film, this might have been a good movie. But for the last Bond film of Connery's turn, it is a letdown. It is quite ironic that this film had some of the problems that were exhibited in You Only Live Twice.
First of all, there is not a good villain in Diamonds. Donald Pleasance was no better than ok as Blofeld in YOTL. However, Charles Gray is not much better, in fact hes worse. There is nothing memorable about this Blofeld at all. Also, the scenes with the satellite blowing things up are downright bad. The special effects are horrible. If Diamonds Are Forever had been done after Star Wars, these scenes would probably have been improved. Moonraker was definitely not the best bond film, but the space special effects were quite good. Some of the action scenes were not particularly exciting. I am talking about the one with the moon vehicle(was that supposed to be funny?) and also the ending was not exciting either. The one impressive action scene (and yes it is pretty good) is the car chase around Las Vegas. It is easily the most exciting scene in the film.  Despite what some people have said about his performance, I found Sean Connery to be excellent here. In fact, he was one of the best parts about the film. However, the same cannot be said about Jill St. John. She is attractive but at times she was downright annoying as Tiffany Case. Lana Woods did not have much screentime and that is good because she was damn near annoying as St. John was. The gay assassins were irritating and pointless. One of the strangest casting choices was Jimmy Dean as Willard Whyte. Dean does not give a terrible performance, but its not exactly a good one either. He does deliver a one-liner well(""Fire him""). Despite the underwhelming conclusion to Connerys turn as Bond, it is not all bad. Diamonds is not really a bad film, it is a well-paced film but Connery deserved a better ending. Nevertheless, Diamonds is decent entertainment that could have and should have been better. I cannot fully recommend it but Bond fans should see it.",Diamonds Are Forever

151,carologletree,Definitely the Worst Bond Film up to This Point,4,7 January 2016,"Often considered to be one of the worst Bond movies, and for good reason. The whole film is just a lackluster effort. It's hard to believe that this was directed by Guy Hamilton, the director of ""Goldfinger."" By all means, after the end of ""On Her Majesty's Secret Service,"" it would have been appropriate to have a dark revenge story, but we didn't get that. We instead got basically a comedy.Sean Connery said ""never again"" after ""You Only Live Twice,"" but after George Lazenby's less-than-well-received performance in ""On Her Majesty's Secret Service,"" they had to persuade Connery to come back for a large sum of money. It pains me to say this, but he shouldn't have come back, because he just isn't at his best in this movie. He just seemed completely bored the whole time (well, that's probably because he was).Charles Gray is absolutely abominable as Blofeld. He is not Blofeld at all. Bring back Donald Pleasence or even Telly Savalas. Just thinking about Gray's Blofeld makes me want to hit something.There are way too many silly elements to this film. Yes, it's ideal for a Bond film to have silly elements, but the best Bond films combined substance with that. This film has no such substance.The action scenes lack the energy and tension of the best Bond films. Also, I find Jill St. John as Tiffany Case to be an unmemorable Bond girl.That's not to say it's completely bad. The setting in Las Vegas is really lovely. Some of the jokes here and there are kind of funny, with the best jokes coming from Mr. Wint and Mr. Kidd. I found them amusing, so sue me.Most of the Bond films have a great theme song, and this film is no exception, this time by Shirley Bassey.This is a thoroughly disappointing film, and pretty bad as far as Bond films go. This is easily the weakest Connery Bond film (excluding the unofficial Bond film, ""Never Say Never Again), and one of the worst of the series overall. This is recommended only if you are a die-hard Bond fan and want to see every single film. Otherwise, I'd say skip it.RATING: C-",Diamonds Are Forever
152,Ibuk,1971: A Bond Travesty,2,15 May 2009,"This is a Bond movie but is more like Bond's comedy debut and I am using the term comedy very loosely. DAF is just an excuse for Bond to say some corny bad jokes which don't evoke laughter but make the audience cringe in their seats. The real joke is on the Bond fans who would have gone to see this movie in the cinema expecting a great Bond movie(my heartfelt condolences to those who did). DAF was seen as Connery's comeback, after YOLT Connery decided not to do another Bond movie and the producers had to find someone else to fill his shoes and George Lazenby. In my opinion Lazenby is severely underrated as Bond. After OHMSS the producers persuaded Connery to do another Bond movie. After DAF he quit again and Moore stepped into his shoes and Connery made another debut in Never Say Never Again in 1983, which is not an official Bond movie and Octopussy was released in the same year.The producers followed up the classic OHMSS the only way the Bond producers can, with a truly despicable Bond movie that had none of the brilliance of it's predecessor movie. DAF in a way doesn't feel like a Bond movie for me because it lacks the thrills that the rest of the Bond movies had. Even the bad Bond movies had one or two thrilling sequences. For instance in Die Another Day, which is widely regarded as the worst Bond movie there was the opening sequence.In the opening sequence of DAF,which is more of a continuation from OHMSS sees Bond on the hunt for Blofeld who was responsible for the death of Bond's wife Tracy(Blofeld killed her when they were on the way to their honeymoon at the end of OHMSS). Bond eventually finds Blofeld and he thinks he has succeeded in killing him. Then Bond is sent on another mission, to investigate a smuggling operation and find out who's behind it. He does that by taking the identity of a man called Peter Franks. When he does finally find out who is behind the smuggling operation he is shocked to discover that it is no other than Bond's arch Nemesis Blofeld himself. It's hard to study a movie like DAF objectively, I can think of mostly negative points. I suppose the moon buggy sequence can count as a positive as it is easily the best thing about it. The Shirley Bassey's theme song is bearable so I think that counts as a positive. Onto the negatives, now where shall I start?. First of all there was Connery's frankly half hearted performance as Bond. Then there is the flimsy plotting, half of the time I was struggling to understand what was going on. Secondly the change of tone, from action to comedy doesn't work, particularly not in a Bond movie. Next there was a poor Bond girl in the form of Jill St John. Then there is the awful villains, there was Mr Kitt and Mr Wint who are easily some of the worst villains in the history of Bond. Then there was Charles Gray who is appalling miscast as Blofeld. This is a real shame because Blofeld is easily my favourite villain and he is given such gross misjustice here. Coincidentally Charles Gray was also in YOLT in a cameo as Henderson. Usually I find a redeeming quality in all the Bond movies, even the bad ones but I am well and truly stumped when it comes to DAF. There is the moonbuggy sequence but that is mildly entertaining and can't save the movie single handedly. I would go as far as saying DAF is a real Bond disaster and none of the bad Bond movies can even come close to topping the awfulness of it. If only I could erase the Bond travesty that is DAF from my memory and pretend there are only 21 Bond movies.",Diamonds Are Forever
153,C22Man,You just killed James Bond!...I wish,4,8 July 2015,"Bond Review. Title: Certainly sounds good and fits with the plot, but doesn't really make sense.Pre-Titles: We see Bond storming around trying to find the whereabouts of Blofeld, who he tracks to a facility that makes doppelgangers and appears to kill Blofeld in heated mud. This is a pretty silly opening, with Bond throwing henchmen around like rag dolls and lines like ''CaaaCaaaCairo!'' delivered painfully over- the-top. Bond also seems pretty content here all things considered, did he forget Blofeld killed his wife?Theme Song: Shirley Bassey returns and provides a dreamy, seductive song that is one of the better things here. It's a very atmospheric piece and Bassey has a great powerful voice. It doesn't fit the film at all but that's a good thing really.Plot: Large shipments of diamonds have been disappearing and Bond is sent to America to find it what has happened to them. He quickly learns that Blofeld is behind the smuggling and plans to use the diamonds to power a satellite that can destroy anything it targets. The plot is both boring and confusing, with most of the film being Bond moving from place to place and Blofeld's scheme being in the background most of the time. The film really lacks the excitement of Connery's earlier films too, nothing that memorable happens and it feels more like a series of moments before coming to an increasingly dull climax.James Bond: Sean Connery phones it in and all the coolness he once possessed has left him by this point. He delivers every line with the same bored expression and to be fair the material he's given is pretty weak, but he delivers it like he doesn't care which does the film no favours. Connery clearly aged badly too and this makes Bond look very haggard throughout.Bond Girls: Jill St John looks great as Tiffany Case, but that's it. Case is incredibly boring and every line she says is delivered annoyingly. She also gets stupider the longer the film goes on, which results in her being a beyond useless ally and hilariously terrible in the climax. Lana Wood is pretty weak as Plenty O'Toole, in fact her name is only used for the use of a joke. Wood is extremely inexpressive and is another dumb female here, it's impossible to believe that Bond would be attracted to her. Villains: Charles Gray is completely miscast as Blofeld. He has no menace whatsoever and takes a far too campy approach to the role. In all their scenes he treats Bond with a polite interest and you'd never guess he was a mastermind villain. The scene where he dresses in drag was downright insulting. Bruce Glover and Putter Smith as the weird homosexual assassins Wint and Kidd they are actually quite fun. They're daft villains, but they clearly know it and at least have fun with the roles.Support: Norman Burton makes a truly dreadful Leiter. He just plays him as a bumbling fool and the character is completely incompetent, Bond should hate him at this point. Jimmy Dean as the reclusive Whyte is abysmal. Luckily he has limited screen time, but his southern drawl is ear scraping and Whyte is just a rich ignorant fool for the sake of it.Action: It's all very exaggerated and campy here. Bond escapes via moon buggy in a truly stupid scene and even avoids being cremated at one point. These could be good scenes, but they are shot with no excitement. The lift fight is nicely vicious, but it looks awkward and limits the fight if anything. The climax is horrific, things blow-up unconvincingly and Bond swings Blofeld around in a pod in a climax that is beyond underwhelming. We get a decent car chase around Las Vegas that is shot well, but that is pretty much it.Score: John Barry keeps his excellent record intact with another enjoyable score. It has a bombastic sound that fits the films overblown style and it is successful in creating a sense of excitement. It's a shame that it's wasted here.Production Values: Guy Hamilton clearly tried to recapture the pure entertainment formula that worked so well with Goldfinger and he fails to do so miserably. There is a weirdly camp tone present throughout the film and it doesn't lend itself to the thrilling action we expect from Bond. In a way this film feels more like a self-parody than an actually Bond film. Visually it is very weak, there aren't any shots that standout and it just doesn't feel like a big film like the previous films were. The locations aren't any special either and having it set in the United States makes it more limited, though Las Vegas looks suitably colourful. The script is another weak spot, there are no memorable lines and there are some really terrible lines like ''You just killed James Bond!'' which don't help matters. The special effects deserve a mention because they are just awful, the explosions are some of the fakest looking I've ever seen on film.Conclusion: I'd say that Diamonds Are Forever is possibly the worst Bond film, easily in the bottom three. There are some truly terrible features here and it just feels lazy, in the end there are barely any redeeming qualities. People point the finger at Moore for campiness, but this is where the campy tone is at its very worst and it doesn't suit a Connery film at all. Almost the entire cast is awful, the action is dull, the plot is complicated for the sake of it, it's not interesting visually and Connery clearly doesn't care. The few good points are Bassey's theme and Barry's score, and that isn't enough. This is Bond at its very worse, bloated, strange and extremely lazy.",Diamonds Are Forever
154,Mikew3001,Not a diamond amongst the Bond movies,5,14 October 2002,"""Diamonds Are Forever"" (1971) is the seventh official James Bond movie and saw Sean Connery returning to the role that he left in 1967 for 4 million dollars . After George Lazenby turned down the offer for this movie after his single 007 performance in ""On Her Majesty's Secret Service"" (1969), the producers were desperately looking for a new Bond actor. As Roger Moore was bound to his ""Persuaders"" TV series at that time and another promising young actor, Timothy Dalton, considered himself too young for the role, it was Connery's turn to shave off his moustache and take his toupet and tuxedo for another mission with Martinis, girls and fights.""Diamonds Are Forever"" was the first Bond movie of the seventies and wanted to leave the sixties formula of cold-war-fiction behind - the problem was that the producers didn't know where to move. The whole plot is ridiculous, boring, lame and just another repetition of the Blofeld-wants-to-conquer-the-world-story without any new ideas. So Bond hunts Blofeld and a pack of diamonds around the world, but no one really knows whats going on.The settings - South Africa, Amsterdam and the United States - are not as well photographed as in the previous movies. While ""You Only Live Twice"" (1967) and ""On Her Majesty's Secret Service"" (1969) took much time to show the best sides of Japan and Switzerland and to introduce the local settings and culture to the audiences, the places in ""Diamonds"" are just superfluous. Images of South African gold mines and the city of Amsterdam are just short postcard views, as well as the setting of the Californian desert. You don't see as much of the fascinating city of Amsterdam (e.g. the canal streets) as in the Bond-rip-off ""Puppet On A String"", an Alistair McLean thriller adaption that was filmed at the same time.The action sequences are mainly boring, and a car chase on a parking place looks rather like a scene from an old Keystone Cops comedy. The story itself has no logical progression and no real tempo at all, but is often interrupted by senseless other scenes. There are also too many stupid slapstick and comedy elements involved, but nearly no thrills and suspense.
The worst about this movie is the acting - apart from Connery, there is just a second-class cast in this movie. Charles Gray's Blofeld is not menacing at all and can't compete with Donald Pleasence's and Telly Savalas' Blofeld performances. Jill St. John is a dreadful and stupidly acting Bond girl, and Norman Burton's Felix Leiter looks rather like a shopping clerk. There is an offending couple of gay killers and a funny, but senseless couple of wrestling amazon girls.The positive points about ""Diamonds"" are not many too mention. Connery's performance is good as ever and rescues the film from a complete disaster. There is also a brilliantly edited fighting scene between Bond and a henchman in an elevator in Amsterdam. The theme was sung by Shirley Bassey for the second time after ""Goldfinger"", but hasn't got the impact and style of that classic Bond tune. John Barry's score is fine, but has too many repetitions of the Bond and 007 themes from previous movies and also contains some dull comedy tunes that rather fits into a Disney movie.It's hard to believe that ""Goldfinger"" director Guy Hamilton was responsible for this disappointing Bond adventure that cannot reach the quality and style of the first six 007 missions. Hamilton also directed the following two parts of the series which were as bit better and went into new directions - ""Live And Let Die"" (1973) and ""The Man With The Golden Gun"" (1974) featuring Roger Moore. Fortunately he turned down the direction of ""The Spy Who Loved Me"" (1977) - the first Movie who became a true Bond classic again for a very long time.",Diamonds Are Forever
155,movieman-200,Diamonds are passé in this Bond knock off of Smoky and the Bandit,5,12 June 2005,"Instructed to update the Bond franchise for contemporary and American sensibilities, Guy Hamilton's Diamonds Are Forever (1971) is perhaps the most unglamorous and uncharacteristic of the vintage Bond films. It stars reluctant Sean Connery, agreeing to come back for one last outing after the disastrous response to George Lazenby's one picture stint in On Her Majesty's Secret Service. A South African diamond smuggling ring is cause for concern on this occasion. Not up to Bond's usual assignments, you say? Well, noif it weren't for the fact that everyone associated with these sparkling gems turns up dead. After killing the next link in the smuggling chain, Peter Franks (Joe Robinson) Bond assumes the smuggler's identity to get to the bottom of things. What he discovers is that his old arch nemesis, Blofeld (on this occasion played by Charles Gray) is running the show, this time from the bachelor pad of a reclusive Las Vegas millionaire, Willard Whyte (sausage king, Jimmy Dean).On reflection, the best thing about this film is its no nonsense Bond girl, Tiffany Case (Jill St. John). She represents a considerable shift in definition of the 'Bond girl' from sultry young plaything to fast thinking, sharp-shooting accomplice. The worst thing about the film is its inclusion of, what can only be classified as the most politically incorrect coupling; Mr. Kidd (Putter Smith) and Mr. Wynt (Bruce Glover) a pair of homosexual tongue-in-cheek assassins. The rest of the plot and staging is pretty much par for the course while transforming Bond into something of the vein of Smoky & the Bandit. Lana Wood makes a brief but memorable cameo as crap shooter, Plenty O'Toole. Trina Park and Lola Lawson briefly appear as two acrobatic assassins, Bambi and Thumper, who are easily foiled by James in a reflecting pool outside Whyte's desert home. The anamorphic widescreen transfer from MGM/UA DVD is fairly appealing. Despite several inexplicable occasions where an obtrusive amount of film grain suddenly appears in a single shot, then just as inexplicably disappears, the overall film elements of Diamonds Are Forever are smooth and free of digital or age related anomalies. Colors are somewhat dated but overall nicely balanced. Flesh tones are rarely accurate  appearing too pink or too orange and pasty. Blacks are velvety deep and solid. Whites are generally clean. The audio is Dolby surround but lacking in any bass and with a very frontal sound. Dialogue never sounds natural. Special effects are often shrill and strident.

The Beatles split up, Jim Morrison flat-lined in a bathtub and Vietnam was napalming the American dream to ashes in a controversial conflict that was fast starting to look like an epic fail.The Bond movies had been spoofed, ripped-off, imitated to near death and creatively dismissed by many critics. Lazenby had jumped ship, convinced that Bond was ""old hat"" and had no future other than a rattling decline into celluloid oblivion. This smacks of the same type of miscalculation made by the Decca A&R exec who turned down signing The Beatles because ""guitar bands are on the way out."" New American cinema was starting to turn out some of the greatest genre defining movies ever made. The world was going all glam, glitter and shock-rock - Alice Cooper, Slade, New York Dolls, Sweet, David Bowie.And the original Bond returns in a glitzy, camp, sci-fi extravaganza, that still manages to be the fourth highest grossing film in the US of it's year. Ahead of Dirty Harry, Carnal Knowledge, A Clockwork Orange, Klute, The Last Picture Show and Bedknobs and Broomsticks. No indicator of quality, but certainly of a sustained popularity.DAF is a slyer, more-knowing, self-deprecating artifact of it's time than most give it credit for. In it's sweep, it satirises the absurdity of Howard Hughes and his eccentric reclusivity, the global obsession over the lunar landings (and accompanying conspiracy theory surrounding beliefs of their fakeness), the conquest of space, and pokes fun at the mecca of arbitrary gambling-addicts and those dazzled by the air-headed neon facade of sleazy, hollow glamour.Beneath the veneer of such glamour, death lurks, dispensed by two gay contract killers in the pay of a criminal cross-dressing mastermind with a penchant for white cats and impersonating a reclusive kidnapped multi-millionaire industrialist. And making doubles of himself - for some reason. Are we beginning to grasp it's charm yet? There are so many continuity, plot and logic errors in DAF, that sooner or later one might suspect they are deliberate. Connery coasts through, nonchalant and laid-back and still irrefutably BOND. DAF, it's fair to say, lost the plot, in the tipsy haze of a high-tech Rat Pack hangover. But, as a kid I loved it unconditionally, and I still think it's a blast today. OK, it may not have aged as well as some of it's counterparts from the sixties and seventies, but at the time and in the climate it was released, the escapism it provided and the way in which it integrated/resonated with the mood and flavour of that time and climate, made it stellar entertainment. There's something about it's inherent sincerity and lack of forced, contrived, self-conscious cynicism that appeals.There are some crackling one-liners and dialogue, a ferociously brutal unarmed combat episode in a lift, an eye-melting pink tie, bizarre vehicle chases and the most unconvincing toupee a leading actor ever wore up to that point. It had a bizarre life of it's own.Oh, did I mention Connery was back as Bond? I'd pay the price of admission for that fact alone. Wouldn't you?",Diamonds Are Forever
157,martinpersson97,Bond is back on track,10,22 March 2020,"Whilst most Bond-movies are pretty good, few have met the standards of the first three movies; in particular Goldfinger, which was a masterpiece overall.This movie, however, takes the cake and gives Connery a graceful sendoff in the series.The last movie ended in a quite shocking fashion, in which Bond's wife is murdered by SPECTRE. You may think he will work his way to vengeance throughout the rest of the series - WRONG! Right off the bat, Bond slaughters his way through SPECTRE operatives until he can get to Blofeld, in a manner resembling the intro of Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker - and when he finally finds him, he's out for blood. Before even the opening sequence, Blofeld is dead and Bond is off on another mission. (He's of course later revealed to have survived, but that does not diminish the gravitas of this masterful intro).As for the rest of the movie, the plot is very cleverly written, the action scenes are fantastic, maybe even on par with the ones from Goldfinger - and watching the ever-developing rivalry between Bond and Blofeld is always fun. I will not give too much away in this review, but all that worked well in previous movies is used incredibly well here.Overall, this might be one of the best in the series, and like Goldfinger, will be one of the few movies I give a 10 out of 10.It might not be quite as good as Goldfinger, but not far behind!",Diamonds Are Forever

Jill is lovely but just provides the eye candy and the last gasps of the T & A jokes for this genre. Poor Lana Wood reaches the pinnacle of her career here only to be tossed off a balcony into a shallow pool without her top on. How any one of their careers survived this film is amazing!? Sean purposely killed Bond off in this one although one could see the blase weariness crawling over him in the previous 'You Only Live Twice'. Unfortunate for the films that follow in this series that forever more Bond becomes a parody of a spy--a cartoon man. Lazenby was too pretty, Moore too old, the others just a yawn. One went to see them only for the special effects. This particular film does not age well especially because of the boobie and fag jokes popular at the time. One can almost feel the liberation movements of later years rising in the background like a drumbeat. ""Your days are numbered.""

Producers replace him with Australian born George Lazenby, who makes ""On Her Majesty Secret Service"". This film does reasonably well at the box office, but not as well as the previous episodes... Furthermore, a big part of the audiences and many critics savage Lazenby's performance, rather pale compared to Connery's Bond portrait. ""OHMSS"" has been revalued since, but at the time of the release it's perceived like a disappointment.In '71 producers hire American actor John Gavin for ""Diamonds are forever"" (DAF), but at the very last minute Sean Connery decides to come back to the role for one time only...The film is a kind of remake of ""Goldfinger"" -there is Sean, of course; director Guy Hamilton; Shirley Bassey sings the theme; the story takes place in America; here too we have glamorous elements (diamonds instead of gold).The movie is funny, Sean looks amused and quite relaxed in traveling between Amsterdam and Las Vegas to investigate about a diamond illegal traffic.Nevertheless it's the ""worst"" of his Bonds... It's his less interesting outing as 007. When we think about him as Bond we think about the episodes of the Sixties, when the series was at its beginning. ""Diamonds"" has not the classical atmosphere of ""Goldfinger"" and ""Thunderball"" -the rhythm of DAF is not constant, there are also too many jokes, and a more American humor of the movie spoils the ""Britishness"" of 007. The first part of the film is boring, the second half has more action -although the final battle scene is not very well done.Sean is Sean, but here he looks older than his age -curiously he looks fitter and more charming in ""Never say never again"", an ""unofficial"" Bond done 12 years later!

163,TheEtherWalk,The silliest and one of the worst Bond movies (some spoilers),7,7 July 2003,"Where do I begin?

In an almost cartoonish moment, the world's stupidest guard gets his hand caught in a booby-trap in Bond's jacket. For some reason, all the guards in this scene have little lightning-bolts on their helmets. Bond manages to knock out Blofeld and push him in a pool of lava. (Why is there a big pool of lava in a plastic surgeons school? Completely nonsensical.) Roll the opening credits.The rest of the movie is how Bond must track down some smuggled diamonds, that everyone who comes into contact with gets killed by the two henchmen, Wint and Kidd, who are homosexuals.Highlights of this movie include Blofeld in drag, Bond revealing his Playboy Club Card, a giant space laser which destroys missiles in a very fake manner, a gay man getting a wedgie with his own neck tie (much to his enjoyment), an elephant playing slot machines, a car that can miraculously go from being on it's two left wheels to being on it's two right wheels, and some great shots of Jill St. John's buttocks.This movie is hilariously stupid and should only be watched for it's camp value.",Diamonds Are Forever
164,rjsf96,Connery's Final Farewell,7,28 October 2015,"Connery decided to make one last final appearance as James Bond in Diamonds Are Forever. The first entry in the series where Bond became completely ridiculous and entered its camp stages that followed through to Roger Moore's seven outings as 007.Bond has been given three years to track Blofeld down after the death of his wife in On Her Majesty's Secret Service. Blofeld plans to hold the world to ransom after he constructs a machine made out of diamonds that has the power to destroy an entire continent.Many Bond fans will notice the sudden shift in tone. Where the previous six entries in the franchise took their material fairly seriously Diamonds Are Forever is completely camp in its approach. This will either shock fans or still entertain those that have a real fondness for Bond and Sean Connery.One key example is the secondary villains Mr Wint and Mr Kidd. It is established early on that they are a homosexual couple. It's extremely bizarre and odd for a Bond film that thankfully never comes across as homophobic or insensitive. It only adds a certain strange and peculiar charm to the film that is difficult to explain. Unlike other entries however that were not affected by this problem, Diamonds Are Forever's campness comes at a cost. The girls in the film are merely damsels in distress for the sake of the plot and whenever Bond feels particularly horny. To say that they have little depth would be an understatement as by themselves they barely feel like real characters anyway.Blofeld played by Charles Gray is more laughable than intimidating at any given moment. Most likely due to the fact that Gray starred in You Only Live Twice as an ally for Bond. Therefore it's impossible to shake off this feeling of de ja vu whenever we encounter him. The plot this time around is flat out ridiculous and does not even try to be coherent. Diamonds that have the power to omit a laser by reflecting the sun's heat and thereby destroy the world? No. This is James Bond? No wonder Austin Powers found it so easy to parody the franchise from this point onwards as it had almost became a parody of itself.Though for all its flaws Diamonds Are Forever zips along at a reasonable pace and it's truly wondrous to see Sean Connery in the title role again, even if this outing is one of his weaker films. There are the various stunts to keep action fans happy and enough that is different to ensure that monotony never sets in. In all fairness to Diamonds Are Forever I was never bored or uninterested.Diamonds Are Forever is sure to keep fans of the franchise happy. But whether its outright camp approach will entertain you or leave you bewildered depends entirely on the mind-set of the viewer. After On Her Majesty's Secret Service, Diamonds Are Forever is more of a shrug than the sudden blow to the heart of the former. Still this entry should not be dismissed lightly, particularly if you are in the mood for a fun and breezy Bond adventure. You need look no further.",Diamonds Are Forever

166,Deusvolt,Bond is sent to foil a megalomaniac out to create a super weapon using diamonds.,6,31 December 2005,"The Connery Bond series started when I was a young boy and I took them seriously. Diamonds, however, came out when I was well into my late teens and somewhat more sophisticated. It dawned on me that the Bond films were not really about violence and adventure but....comedy. And it became more comic when Roger Moore took over the role.I remember Robert Vaughn saying when he was asked if he were worried that his Man from Uncle TV series, hugely popular among adolescents in the 60s, would influence them to becoming violent. Vaughn astutely replied that kids understand that the show was to be taken as seriously as Donald Duck cartoons.And that is how I remember Diamonds. Up to now I find myself amused when I recall the scene (SPOILER) near the end of the film when villain Blofeld's two bumbling goons tried to give Bond and his girl a payback for messing up their boss's plans. Bond and his lady (Jill St. John) were enjoying themselves on a cruise ship being served a luscious meal by the two goons disguised as waiters. And the piece d'resistance was Bombe' Surprise. And when Bond asked what was in the Bombe'. The waiter replied that it was a ""surprise"" (pronounced in the French fashion). There literally was a bomb in in the Bombe'.The scene brought back another rib-tickling incident about another bomb disguised as food which I read about in The Manila Times back in the early '60s. A small town provincial mayor was staying in a third rate hotel in Manila during the Christmas season. He received a gift box which seemed to him odd as nobody was supposed to know where he was. . He called the police. Inside the box was a tin globe with the markings of a popular brand of Dutch Edam cheese popularly known as ""Queso de Bola"" (ball cheese). The Manila Times reporter quipped that it turned out to be a Queso de Bomba because there really was a bomb inside the tin. The idea of Edam ball cheese as a weapon is not really novel as I remember reading about a battle between the English and the Spanish during the age of cannonballs when the English, running out of cannonballs, used baby Edams as shot. They won.",Diamonds Are Forever
167,stp43,The Weakest Of The Bond Series,6,12 August 2003,"After six films in which only minor faults can be found, I guess it was inevitable that a dip in the James Bond series would arise.  It is nonetheless disappointing that Diamonds Are Forever turned out as it did. Returning Sean Connery to the role of 007 warmed the hearts of many, but the resulting film hurt the series' reputation.The film's faults lay in several areas.  First there is consistent miscasting.  Charles Gray takes over the role of Bond archenemy Ernst Stavro Blofeld and fails to convey any real menace - at times he comes off more as a mild Burgess Meredith imitation than as a serious criminal mastermind. Gray shone as Henderson from You Only Live Twice but is miscast here, especially in his awful drag disguise.Then there is the inept Jill St. John as Tiffany Case, diamond smuggler recruited by SPECTRE who helps James defeat them.  St. John isn't as attractive as other Bond girls and is too gee-whiz wide-eyed to be taken seriously here.Then there are the film's offbeat henchmen, homo assassins Messrs Wint and Kidd.  They enjoy their work together a little too much throughout the film and are so annoying as to ruin any tension their presence conveys.  Their demise is unsatisfying as well - Wint's arms are set ablaze and he just stands there and lets the fire envelop him (haven't these bad guys heard of stop, drop, and roll?), while Kidd winds up running with his tail (or more accurately another appendage) between his legs.With all this miscasting comes the film's next signature failing, its campiness.  Cheesy one-liners pervade the dialogue (especially with Messrs Wint and Kidd) and the film's mood is totally wrong - there simply is no tension created at any time.  Sean Connery's performance is his weakest ever - he basically phones in his performance in near-complete camp style and his one-liners lack any bite.The campiness extends to the scene that cheats the audience worst of all - the sex scene that never was between Bond and Plenty O'Toole, seen from the back before bein grabbed and uncermoniously tossed into a pool by Mob henchman (veteran TV heavy Sid Haig is one of the mobsters) working for Tiffany Case.Then there is the setting.  Part of the strength of the Bond films is their setting in varied locales about which most in the audience lack any real knowledge - the West Indies settings of Dr. No and Thunderball, the Turkish-Balkan settings of From Russia With Love, Japan in You Only Live Twice, and the Swiss Alps in On Her Majesty's Secret Service add enormously to the atmosphere of the films.  In Diamonds the Las Vegas setting totally fails; there is nothing in Vegas to convey any kind of dramatic atmosphere. The film is obviously trying to recapture the magic of Goldfinger, with its setting in the US, but the complete camp and cheese atmosphere and the complete familiarity of Vegas robs any tension from the setting.The central SFX sequence and climatic air-cavalry assault on Blofeld's HQ also fail; inspired by both the space setting of You Only Live Twice and the helicopter assault at the end of Her Majesty's Secret Service, this time there is no surprise element, no real suspense, and the effects work on the film's laser cannon looks cheap and sloppy - one can live with the comparative cheapness of the rocket launches in You Only Live Twice, but the explosion effects here simply do not work.It is all of such low quality that even the film's strengths are overlooked - the surprisingly effective performance of Jimmy Dean, the swimming lesson between James and athletic guardians Bambi and Thumper, the competent performance of Normann Burton as Felix Leiter (though once again miscasting is the case), the uncredited Shane Rimmer, and the always engaging Bernard Lee, Lois Maxwell, and Desmond Llewelyn.It would take a few years before the Bond series truly returned to its entertaining plateau of the 1960s, and Diamonds has aged reasonably well, but it nonetheless is the nadir of the Bond series.",Diamonds Are Forever

Diamonds are Forever falls in the former category although I'm not totally sure why. It's like after the serious action-packed 60's they decided to just calm down and relax, this is the most chilled out and mellow Bond film there is. It has that air of coolness that only early 70's films seem to have. There is a plot of sorts but there's no rush to get there. John Barry's score is his most jazzy and laid back. You feel this was the Bond film that most inspired Tarentino. Do you think so Mr Wint, I do Mr Kidd. Connery seems to really enjoy himself playing Bond again, now surprisingly looking older than his forty years although he was still younger than Roger Moore when he played Bond for the first time the following year, the role seems to fit him even better than before.

170,glenn-aylett,A real let down,2,18 June 2011,"Another film that is frequently shown on Saturday afternoons in England but not a Bond film I would stay in for as Connery was more or less bribed to appear in it, he looks bored all the way through and the scenes with him in a pink tie make him look stupid. Basically the premise is this. Bond is called in to investigate a diamonds smuggling ring and, of course, this being Bond this is more than some two bit gangsters and the whole thing is controlled by SPECTRE, who as usual are hell bent on holding the world to ransom.Actually Diamonds starts off very well, with Bond tracking down Blofeld, who as you remember from On Her Majesty's Secret Service had Bond's wife gunned down. The teaser scene where Bond brutally extracts Blofeld's location from Blofeld's associated and where he kills off Blofeld's double and someone who is apparently Blofeld ( but isn't as the real Blofeld is in Las Vegas) is as good as anything in a Connery Bond, but then the film descends into some kitschy, camp farce where Charles Gray's Blofeld is about as threatening as Dick Emery.It is not that this is a terrible film that would be nominated for a Golden Raspberry, and certainly box office takings suggested it was popular back in the day, it's just such a letdown considering Sean Connery was first class in his previous Bond films. Apart from Connery looking hacked off and overweight and Charles Gray's camp Blofeld, Jill St John is completely useless as Tiffany Case, possibly the worst Bond girl ever, and what are we to make of the camp assassins Kidd and Wint, who are about as convincing as Laurel and Hardy? However, one unlikely scene makes up for all these useless characters, Bambi and Thumper, two female bodyguards who decide to give the overweight Bond a real beating in a penthouse. Yet even this can't save what is a lame film and it drags on to a predictable conclusion with a mass shoot out on an oil rig.",Diamonds Are Forever

This film is the worst of the two. It's a mostly dull and ridiculously improbable adventure in which we find 007 once again going after Mr. Ernst Stavro Blofeld. Along the way, he gets caught up in foiling Blofeld's latest silly plan involving diamonds used as weapons, and meets the incredibly unattractive Tiffany Case. The acting is, for the most part, terrible. It is easily Connery's worst performance as Bond. ""Tiffany"" also comes across as an incredibly ridiculous character and lacks the sass and flair, as well as the looks, of the other Bond girls. Most of this is due to a terrible acting performance. These performances are not aided by the plot, which moves in a much slower and less interesting fashion than usual, nor by the special effects, which this film seems to lack. Now, I feel I cannot be entirely negative, so I will say that it was very enjoyable to watch Mr. Wint and Mr. Kidd strutting around and killing people. They added a much needed dark humor to the film, and made very interesting villains. Still, this film is a shipwreck.

172,Katz5,Missed opportunities,6,6 April 2021,"George Lazenby decided not to return as 007 for Diamonds are Forever - he was not sacked by the producers because of the disappointing box office of his Bond debut in 1969. Perhaps he fancied himself as a ""serious"" actor and didn't want to get pigeonholed. Can you name a movie besides Kentucky Fried Movie that features George Lazenby? Didn't think so. Whether he had regrets later on, we'll never know. But the producers needed to find a new Bond quickly.....so Connery was coaxed back--""only one more time!"". The box office returns were better this time around, probably because of Connery's return. He appears to be going through the motions just to pick up that fat paycheck....although he does have a fair amount of chemistry with Bond girl Jill St. John (the first American Bond girl). With Shirley Bassey singing the lead song and a precious stone (instead of a precious metal) in the film's title, perhaps they thought they had another Goldfinger. Not quite. The appearance of Blofeld was rather ridiculous in this movie, and the sub villain Willard Whyte played by sausage king Jimmy Dean didn't seem much like a villain at all. The plot is overstuffed.

It's so strange that it makes the film very good.Jill St John who played Tiffany Case started off well as John's character was fearless who put Bond in his place but about half way through the film becomes scared of the least little thing and become's flirty.

Joe Robinson played this role well but is it just me or does he look like WWE superstar Paul 'Triple H' Levesque?

Here Gray is a colossal bore who does nothing except bark orders out and push buttons. And what sense does it make to have him without a mark on him?

Unfortunately, the script quality dropped in the process, and we have this strange movie to deal with. DAF is so 'seventies' it's painful. Moon buggys, homosexual hit men, Blofeld in drag, etcetera. There's a funny 'Warhol movie' vibe to it, and not in a good way. The plot is convoluted, the movie rambling and some of the acting (Mr Connery, I'm looking at you) is variable. In an interview extra on the DVD Connery blatantly admits to doing it for the money, and it looks like it. He wanders absently through the plot, perhaps preoccupied with how best to utilise the fruits of the great deal he just got to be Bond again.

Maybe this is due to the screenplay by the excellent Tom Mankiewicz who would later script the next two Roger Moore outings.Sean Connery returning to the role after the departing of the disastrous George Lazenby is very welcome indeed, but sadly, Sean Connery in Diamonds Are Forever is not the same as Sean Connery in From Russia With Love or Goldfinger.In fact, Connery looks about two stone overweight in this one, with a greying toupee and a tired, vacant look on his face. Its actually frightening to see how much he has aged in almost ten years and not in a good way. Not that the great man would give a stuff considering the fortune he made on this flick. Still, hes better on an off day as Bond than Lazenby firing on all cylinders.This was the 007 that also had a great pair of Homosexual killers Mr Wint and Mr Kidd. Having them murder and spout one liners all through the film is one of DAF's highlights. However, the casting of Charles Gray as Blofeld (WITH HAIR) is crap.

It is the 7th film in the James Bond series, and the sixth and final to star Sean Connery as star of Eon Productions' James Bond film series. Connery would later return as Secret Agent James Bond in the 1983 unofficial James Bond movie Never Say Never Again. Connery returned for Diamonds Are Forever after his absence from the previous Bond film, On Her Majesty's Secret Service, starring George Lazenby in the lead role.Connery would later lend his voice to the 2005 video game adaptation of From Russia with Love. In the film, Bond impersonates a diamond smuggler to infiltrate a smuggling ring. He soon uncovers a plot by his old nemesis Blofeld to use the diamonds to build a giant laser satellite that he will use to hold the world ransom.Loosely based on the Ian Fleming novel of the same name, it was produced by Harry Saltzman and Albert R. Broccoli and released in 1971. It was the second of four films to be directed by Guy Hamilton.",Diamonds Are Forever
178,cordaro9418,Back for one night only!,6,10 September 2008,"Definitely a Vegas story.Retire, come out of retirement, just to say it's over and do it again a decade later. Sean Connery's swan song to 007 hit mid-stride in this mediocre effort.Bad hair piece, slightly out of shape and just barely wanting to be there, Connery accepted the return role for the astronomical contract (which he used to start his children's charitable foundation) and not just to make George Lazenby forgettable.Lazenby starred in Connery's desired role of 'OHMSS', which a tired and fed-up Sean passed up. The Aussie newcomer worked, but imploded himself out of the role. Connery was brought back 'the original and the still the best', but not in a better film. Sean would have been far better off using 'OHMSS' as his exit vehicle and dumping 'Diamonds', instead of vice-versa.Short on good plot theories and long on yet another Blofeld, the story loosely uses the aloof Howard Hughes as it's back-story, the aviator still a mystery and monopoly in Vegas at the time.Utilizing Bond's first 'car chase' (Steve McQueen's 'Bullit', impacting cinema history) up and down Fremont Street, the film winds it's way across the globe and 007's distracted revenge as he saves the world.Connery's unofficial effort in 'Never Say Never Again' for Warners a decade later, saves his 007 reputation where this film, otherwise, would have damaged it.Bring the popcorn, but a bathroom break is allowed.",Diamonds Are Forever

Then again, it can be enjoyed",5,17 April 2010,"Diamonds Are Forever is one of the Bond films that has lived on as one of the most famous, I hope just because of the theme music. It's just to silly, too...not suave, not clever and definitely not witty. Maybe it was because Sean Connery was on his last legs or because the producers just went over the top. The story is only loosely based on the novel and is confusing and very strange. The return of Blofeld is so unnecessary. The film contrasts horribly with the previous film's emotional ending. Yet somehow it still, just, hangs together. It can be enjoyable, providing you don't take it too seriously. For me though, it just isn't what Bond should be.",Diamonds Are Forever
180,charlessmith702210,"One of my favorite vintage Bond flicks since ""Live and Let Die""",7,1 January 2007,"This movie, ""Diamonds Are Forever"" was probably a great prelude to the latest flick involving diamonds used in countries in war---""Blood Diamond.""The scene involving two evil dancers who fight against 007 looks like something out of a few of the fight scenes in ""Goldeneye"" too---the idea of ""dancing and fighting"" by the anti-Bond ladies.The space weapon in ""Diamonds"" that goes haywire and beams a heat-emitting laser ray that burns anything in its vicinity was almost similar to that space weapon used in ""Goldeneye"". Especially when the ray heats up---and blows up--an entire anti-aircraft missile emplacement. Well, instead of electromagnetic pulse like ""Goldeneye""---it is heat in ""Diamonds Are Forever"" that is used in the weapon's destructive force.All of that leads into the final battle at an oil rig which masks as a main computer base, housing the main control area for that haywire space weapon. Well, Bond stops the main evil character by hoisting up his escape ship and slamming it into the main control area, knocking the computer out of commission. The laser weapon was supposed to attack Washington D.C. but the failure of the master control put the whole evil contraption out of commission. I especially like the mini-fight scene involving two accomplices of the main evil character that were about to kill Bond and his lady companion with a dynamite bomb rigged on a timer. Of course, when Bond fights back by putting that bomb on the back of one of the bad men and throwing him overboard just in time (the bomb blows just before he hits the water)---you know that Bond is going to live another day.",Diamonds Are Forever
181,98nurdinm-1,"What'shh that, you shhay? Another Connery film?",4,12 April 2005,"""Diamonds Are Forever"" can truly be considered to be the first really great BAD Bond film in the franchise. This film has been slated many, many times - and I'm afraid it's not going to get off easily from your friendly resident neighbourhood Bond fanatic, either!After supposedly killing Ernst Stavro Blofeld (Charles Grey - why isn't he bald?) Bond returns to normal service. He is assigned to investigate a series of drug smuggling operations that spreads the world over. In Amsterdam he meets Tiffany Case (Jill St John), one of the members of this pipeline, and together they travel to Las Vegas. Bond learns that the culprit is one Willard Whyte, a Las Vegas tycoon who hasn't been seen for years. After climbing up into Whyte's personal suite, Bond discovers that Whyte is in fact Blofeld - or at least, one of Blofeld's clones. He plans to use the diamonds in a laser up in space that magnifies the sun's rays towards fields of nuclear weapons, and demanding a ransom for the surviving weapons from the other countries. Bond stops Blofeld aboard his Oil Rig of Terror - when has an oil rig been terrible? Oh God, where do I start?It's not that film is meant to be bad - far from it - it just is so very, very BAD! Connery should not have returned to the Bond franchise, it just confuses everything utterly with the matter of the previous film. The fact that his dead wife is never mentioned is one major loophole - but see the Message Board for this movie and you will see an interesting interpretation from yours truly.EYE-CANDY: Jill St John is where the Bond girls started to have bigger bra sizes than IQs. She starts off really well, though, and you get the feeling that this tough woman is let down by a really bad script! Lana Wood steps in for what in essence becomes a meaningless role as Plenty O'Toole - ""Named after your father, perhaps?"" asks Bond dryly. Because of the edits of this film, the importance of this character is seriously diminished, and she just becomes another piece of eye candy. (Though WHAT a piece of eye candy!)BADDIES: Cahrles Grey as Blofeld is an interesting idea, and with hindsight could have been very successful. But in the end, along with Jill St John, this fine actor is let down by a bad script, and his end is not particularly dramatic or amusing to watch. However, one positive from this movie comes from Mr Wint and Mr Kidd, (Putter Smith & Bruce Glover), a pair of odd assassins who are well suited to the Bond universe of strange characters. They are very funny in some scenes - it's just a pity that the humour used for the was used for everybody else.OVERALL: There is no disguising that this is a very disappointing film to watch, and a times is almost dreadful. But perhaps we must keep this in mind. Connery did not, at the end of the day, keep his pay packet. All the money he was paid went towards his new charity for Scottish children. Interpret that how you will.4/10",Diamonds Are Forever
182,freewillyfan,Diamonds are Forever,6,1 November 2019,"Diamonds are Forever is the sixth and final official Sean Connery Bond film. This film is mix bag for me. After the way the previous movie ended, this one should have been darker. Also what they did with the villain with the multiple Blofeld's a little ridiculous. The henchmen were pretty good. Sean Connery's Return was welcomed. This film is a little more campy then the previous ones. There are some fun action scenes, I really enjoyed the car chase in Vegas.6.5/10",Diamonds Are Forever
183,TimBoHannon,An Highly Inadequate Finale to the Sean Connery era.,2,26 May 2008,"Sean Connery made it clear during the filming of ""You Only Live Twice"" that he was sick of playing James Bond. After four years, 1.25 million dollars, an agreement to receive one-eighth of the film's gross profit, and a commitment to finance two additional projects of his choice, Connery returned for another spin as the world's deadliest government agent. Sadly, the man who electrified the world for six years returned for a problematic movie that at best is a disappointment and at worst a large black stain on his legacy.Many of the problems that drown ""Diamonds Are Forever"" show up in the opening minutes. It begins where ""On Her Majesty's Secret Service"" ends. Bond is on the revenge trail following the murder of his wife. Connery's face remains hidden to raise anticipation, but when it finally appears, my reaction is shock.At one time he looked like the handsome, debonair ladies man he is supposed to be, but at 41, Connery has outlived the part. He has more wrinkles, his eyes have darkened with age, he is getting fatter, and his hair is grayer. I once watched a clip online of a scene where he is standing next to Q, played by Desmond Llewelyn, who was 56 years old with white hair. I initially mistook him for one of Q's assistants.""From Russia with Love"" displayed Connery at his best. In every possible way, he made the part his own with an authority neither he nor the five actors following him have since been able to equal. This time he was just doing it for the money, and it shows. In ""Goldfinger,"" he said ""Bond, James Bond"" with focus and cool. Here, it is delivered with unexpressive staccato. When he is ordered to put up his hands, he moves them to the side like a man bored with being bored.Diamond smuggling out of South Africa has risen over the past two years. Since no smuggled stones have reached the market, the British government fears somebody may be accumulating them in preparation for a market dump. A string of recent murders in South Africa leads them to fear that operations are being shut down, leaving them little time to bust the smugglers. James Bond is sent undercover as smuggler Peter Franks. His mission takes him to the casinos of Las Vegas, where he discovers the involvement of his old enemy, Ernst Stavro Blofeld (Charles Gray).Gray is another problem evident from the beginning. Blofeld is supposed to be bald, but even if Gray was bald he would not remotely look or sound the part. In ""From Russia with Love,"" Blofeld seemed like a god. Gray is not imposing, and seeing the mighty Blofeld dressing as a transvestite is the worst insult in the series. For the ignominious title of worst Bond villain, Gray loses to Stephen Berkoff from ""Octopussy,"" but barely.When Bond finally discovers Blofeld, how does he react? He indulges in polite conversation. The movie forgets that Bond is speaking to the man who callously murdered his wife, and that Blofeld is addressing the man who broke his neck.Another huge minus is the general lack of excitement. It has a good start with an intense elevator fight between Bond and the real Peter Franks. If you see this film, which I strongly discourage, savor that fight, because ""Diamonds"" becomes pretty anemic afterwards. The remainder lacks intrinsic interest or excitement. Aside from a slick nighttime street chase, the little action that is left looks fake and slow. When Bond is faced with trouble, what does he do? He runs, preferably in a phony moon machine. From start to finish, he does not fire a single bullet. Adding insult is the cheap climax. Six years earlier, this franchise won a visual effects Oscar. Now they are reduced to creating nuclear explosions that look like puffs of smoke. Connery's salary supposedly slashed the special effects budget even though the franchise made over a 400 million dollar profit since ""Goldfinger."" Two musicians are cast in supporting roles. Imagine ""Quantum of Solace"" casting Garth Brooks and Wynton Marsalis. Ironically, it is country singer Jimmy Dean who brings the most convincing act to the table. Jill St. John and Lana Wood are wasted as the bimbo and harlot, respectively. Mr. Wint (Bruce Glover) and Mr. Kidd (Putter Smith) are the gay hit men who don't know each other's first names, and the best I can say about them is that they die entertainingly.""Diamonds Are Forever"" marked the beginning of sad decade for Agent 007. Were it not for ""The Spy Who Loved Me,"" the series likely would have died. A movie with shoddy writing, substandard acting, misplaced atmosphere and bad characters cannot succeed. Diamonds slowly decay into other forms of carbon, so they are not truly forever. Neither is Sean Connery.",Diamonds Are Forever

Sumptuous cinematography, both studio and on the Las Vegas locations. A well paced script and good storyline make this Bond a treat.This was Bond, how Ian Fleming intended. Notably, Bond displays some rope techniques (when escaping underneath the rig) that would surely of been true to the character's naval training. On another note, I'd love to know where the 'summerhouse' was, that Willard White was held captive in. A very fine example of mid century modern architecture!",Diamonds Are Forever
185,Magenta_Bob,"Not the best Bond film,but still lots of fun",7,19 February 2010,"Diamonds Are Forever may not be the most memorable or all around best entry of the series – indeed, the general consensus seems to be that it is one of the worst – but it does deliver most of the things I look for in a Bond film; good fights and car chases, witty dialogue, attractive women, and, most of all, a couple of hours of sheer entertainment.Things start off wonderfully with a pre-credit sequence, where James Bond hunts down the archrival Blofeld, presumably for revenge from the previous film, that really sets the tone of the film; incredibly cheesy but lots of fun. After that we get a plot about diamond smuggling and some kind of evil scheme including nuclear warfare and world domination that is as difficult to follow as it is to care for, but it does provide a good playfield for Bond. Most notably, there is a great fight scene in an elevator, and a sensational car chase through Las Vegas.This was Sean Connery's last film as James Bond (save the somewhat unofficial Never Say Never Again), which might explain why he looks a bit uninspired. Nevertheless, an uninspired Connery is still better than most actors, at least in this role. With very few gadgets and virtually no screen time for Q and Moneypenny, he has to carry the film a lot on his own, and still does a good job with that. There are still some complaints to be made about Diamonds Are Forever. It features the usual dull climax at the villain's base with lots of explosions and an alarming countdown, and the henchmen Mr. Kidd and Mr. Wint are awfully weird and misplaced. It is unsure who they are working for or what they are doing, and the homosexual subtext is strangely out of place. However, most of the weak points can easily be forgiven when you have so much fun along the way.",Diamonds Are Forever

It's especially jarring as this film seems to undo the character growth of Bond from the previous story. And yet I find the film entertaining enough to forgive that as it ultimately doesn't damper the Bond experience. Diamonds are Forever doesn't appear to cater the same esteem as earlier Bond stories. Personally I don't ascribe to the notion that a sillier approach is inherently bad, and a film like this seems to only be a natural evolution from something like Goldfinger. Connery's performance isn't much to dwell on although I've always had a soft spot for Jill St. John as one of the most entertaining and memorable Bond girls.

Blofeld is a drag queen game show host with clones of himself who wants to destroy the world with the laser. The movie is derivative and doesn't have much of a story. With the lead ""Bond girl"" Tiffany Case, the series regressed from having real characters like Aki to dumb bikini sex-object women.Connery, out of shape, disinterested and not even trying to hold back his Scottish accent gives a phoned-in performance. Connery probably didn't even watch the previous film in which Blofeld killed Bond's wife, because his performance Blofeld, in the last installment, killed Bond's wife and Connery's portrayal of the character isn't too affected.The henchmen Wint/Kidd are great and there are some funny scenes like the old lady smuggling diamonds. There's some good atmosphere, music and camp scenes in the movie, but it's a snooze overall. Diamonds Are Forever is the transitionary period between the Connery era and the Moore era. It's clear that Eon wanted to move the series in more comic direction, but Connery wasn't quite the actor that could roll with the gags like Moore eventually would.",Diamonds Are Forever

He uncovers yet another dastardly plot by S.P.E.C.T.R.E. Ringleader Blofeld.The camp in this movie is dialed up even with good direction by returning director Guy Hamilton. Clearly a showpiece for Connery, the movie is filled with pop culture reference and inside jokes , all of which keep the flow moving. The Supporting cast is highlighted by the assassination team of Mr. Wint and Mr. Kidd.Sean Connery had large control over the film team, was paid well and given the rights to star in a Bond film of his choosing at a later time.

192,Theflyace,Bond Month #7: Oh Wow this Sucks,3,11 October 2013,"After the Lazenby departed the series after one outing in On Her Majesty's Secret Service, the relieved producers and fans were gung-ho to get Sean Connery back, paying him a record sum of a million dollars. They were also concerned that Bond was falling out of touch with audiences. What to do about this? I KNOW! How about a campy, silly, over-the-top cornball of a movie that would never work in any galaxy. Brilliant!!!! This movie, Diamonds are Forever, sucks.The story involves Bond stopping a diamond smuggling ring by the now so-silly villain I want to strangle him Blofeld (played ineptly by Charles Gray)and his seemingly gay henchman Mr. Wint and Mr. Kidd. He also joins forces with initially interesting but then falls into bimbo- status Tiffany Case, ho-ho funny. (played profoundly awfully by Jill St-John) This story and how it plays out is so ungodly bland I refuse to talk about it anymore. In fact, I think this movie makes You Only Live Twice look like a bearable film.Sean Connery looks so old and slower in this film that it makes me feel uncomfortable. He plays James Bond like a parody, sort of an Adam West version of it. (""Fun"" fact: Adam West was considered to take over the role from Lazenby) The rest of the cast is downright poor too, given poor lines and situations to act in. Jimmy Dean, ""the sausage king,"" is even given a pivotal role, ugh.This movie is just way to jokey and cynical to be passable as a film. I feel bad for Tom Mankiewicz, not because he did a poor job, but because he was directed to do so by the producers. What seemed like the norm back then, didn't even make those cinema-goers laugh. Good thing he redeemed himself in the next Bond film, and he later did a fantastic job as the writer of Superman I and II: The Richard Donner Cut.There is only one thing about this movie that is awesome. The car chase in Las Vegas. Not only is the car involved a Boss 302 Mustang, but the fact that it is driven on two wheels which is amazing. That is the highlight of this awful movie.So ya, this movie is as bad as my review suggests.Well... onto the new era with Roger Moore with Live and Let Die.",Diamonds Are Forever
193,The Spectacular Spider-Man,"Overly Americanised, action-free camp-fest",5,5 October 2008,"DAF is one of the weakest, laziest movies in the franchise.For a start, where is the action? Apart from a good close quarters punch up in a lift, there is hardly any. What remains is lacking in energy and played mainly for laughs. 007 beaten up by two acrobatic women - until he just holds them underwater in a swimming pool. An awful slapstick car-trashing chase in Vegas. And the big finale is anything but. We have a few of Blofled's henchmen fighting a few helicopters. Bond does almost nothing except swing Blofeld's escape pod around with a crane.Which brings us to another point - this is without doubt the least serious Bond movie ever. It is borderline comedy throughout, clearly influenced by the likes of The Man from UNCLE and the Batman TV show. Blofeld dresses in drag at one stage. Most of the supporting characters are comic relief. The sinister henchmen, Wint and Kidd, would stand out in any other movie due to their extreme black humour, but here they are just wasted. Jill St John's Tiffany Case is amongst the worst Bond girls, silly and helpless.We even see Q - in Vegas - cheating on a slot machine.At least Connery is back right? Wrong. He's clearly on set, but equally clearly thinking about his next round of golf. Even his delivery of 'Bond, James Bond' is awful. He isn't helped by some awful costume decisions, including a brown tweed suit, and a pink (!) tie. Connery's huge payout for this film means everything else looks cheaper than before; by the climax you have embarrassing helicopter explosions, clearly animated, that would have been superbly detailed model shots in previous (and later) movies.There is virtually nothing good to say about Diamonds. The film is so lacking in energy or excitement that only the plot manages to pull it along. It's a series of weird and comedic scenes that hardly feel like a Bond movie in any way, and it's hard to believe this came after On Her Majesty's Sceret Service. The film scrimps so much on the action that you are left watching a bizarre, parallel universe version of Bond where nothing remotely Bond-ish seems to happen. It feels almost like a live-action version of a Saturday morning Bond cartoon, watered down for the kids (Bond never even uses his gun).Two plus points; Shirey Bassey's theme tune is superbly atmospheric and mysterious. Jill St John is very sexy. That's it. Connery came back, the director of Goldfinger came back, and the result was this farce.",Diamonds Are Forever

Connery is superb as Bond, the pacing is excellent, the humor is well used and the suspense is handled very well. Since Connery is my favorite Bond I remember this being one of his better outings during his 007 tenure but on repeat viewing it's really just average. The first half is actually quite good overall as the story leads up to Las Vegas. The Vegas scenes are actually very well done albeit the one goofy scene at Circus Circus, but the film really runs out of steam once Bond and his lady leave Vegas. I feel Connery could have used a stronger concluding film in the canonical Bond universe (I am not counting Never Say Never Again as his final Bond film, mind you). As it stands its watchable but Connery should have had an entry with more momentum than this one before concluding his legendary run as Bond.",Diamonds Are Forever

My favorite things about the movie would be the villains. Blofeld, Peter Franks, Mr. Wint, Mr. Kidd. Memorable. The humor - nice! For years I used to only be familiar with the version that was seen on ABC, thus heavily edited and not shown in the 2:35 format. When I finally saw the unedited version in its theatrical format, it blew me away. Especially the elevator sequence. It is unwatchable in the 1:33 format. Too bad the sequence was deleted regarding what led up to Plenty's fate. It would have made sense in the film. Enjoyable anytime!",Diamonds Are Forever

I didn't think it would be very good because everyone says it's one of the worst in the series and also because the book, in my opinion, is the second worst of Ian Fleming's James Bond novels (The Spy Who Loved Me is slightly worse). The movie is pretty fun. The plot and action were good. And Jill St. John is, in my opinion, the most beautiful of all the Bond girls. I didn't think her acting was so good but I didn't really care.I was kind of disappointed by the climax, though. The movie just turned into a more subdued Thunderball, with Blofeld blackmailing the world with the threat of destroying it. (It is a bit more interesting than the book, though - plain diamond smuggling just isn't all that exciting.) And the special effects in the climax are among the worst in the series, if not the worst. When Blofeld destroys missiles and submarines with his laser and when the helicopters attacking Blofeld's oil rig lair, it all looks pretty fake.So Diamonds Are Forever is definitely not the best in the series, but it's also not the absolute worst.",Diamonds Are Forever
198,theskylabadventure,A disaster from beginning to end,3,6 January 2008,"There's not a great deal to be said about this film that hasn't been said on these boards before. With the blood, sweat and tears pour out in OHMSS, we were introduced to a new, grittier kind of Bond. I don't know who decided that it didn't work, but clearly someone did. 'Diamonds Are Forver' was the follow up, and is cemented at the very bottom of most Bond lists.Sean Connery looks like he couldn't care less what's going on in this film. It seemed to be a case of take the money and.. stroll. The plot is all but non-existent but still manages to confuse and bore. The action is timid and dull, the locations are far from inspired and Charles Gray is nothing short of pathetic in the role of Bond's nemesis, Blofeld, who seems to have gone from uber-villain to uber-camp cabaret act. Seriously, he's about as fearsome as my grandmother.It is important to bear in mind that Blofeld murdered Bond's wife at the end of the last film. In spite of this, Bond seems to consider him a mere annoyance in this movie, rather than the object of blind rage, as you might expect. Their confrontation is more akin to Austin Powers vs Dr Evil than it is to Bond vs Blofeld from the previous films. The performances of Connery and Gray in these scenes may as well have been shot on different days, there is that little tension between them.Thinking about it, there is really nothing at all memorable about this tripe. Even John Barry's score felt mediocre after OHMSS. This film is a disgrace to the franchise and to Connery's career. The only small redemption is that Connery's used the whopping fee he earned for this to make 'The Offence' with Sidney Lumet. Ignore 'Diamonds' and watch that. You'll thank me later.",Diamonds Are Forever
199,Dock-Ock,This Christmas its Diamonds. Because Diamonds are Forever,10,11 December 2001,"With Diamonds are Forever as its starting point, the Bond series takes its first steps towards a revolution. Although Cubby Broccoli had yet to introduce the  style , technique and humour that the Bond movies employed to define the 70's Action/Adventure movies,didn't untill The Spy Who Loved me [1977], the blueprints to all the greatest 70's Bond movies are very evident and apparent with Diamonds are Forever. From the very start of the fantastic pre-credits sequence in wich Bond hunts down Blofeld, presumably to avenge his wifes death [On Her Majesty's Secret Service, 1969], the claim is made that this is going to be lighter and more fun than anything  on a Bond movie since Goldfinger [1964]. This is thanks to three important factors,  Guy Hamilton who directed Goldfinger is back to direct his first Bond movie since the 1964 classic. With him Hamilton brings along alot of comic book orientated ideas and a wondefuly imaginative and humourous writer in Tom Manciewicz. Manciewicz is youthful and more American in his ways of writing and this gives Diamonds a fresh and polished feel to characters and action sequences. Sadly the script for Diamonds is one of the less involving and suspenseful of the series but no less enjoyable. The third factor in Diamonds success is the return of Sean Connery. Relaxed and re-energised after his hiatus from On Her Majesty's Secret Service, Connery looks to be enjoying himself, and this seems to be an inspiration to the rest of the cast and the overall look of the movie. In truth, Diamonds Are Forever is one of the most enjoyable and original of the entire Bond series.It would have been nice perhaps that in the wake of On Her Majesty's Secret Service, George Lazenby and OHMSS's Director Peter Hunt had returned to do a follow up revenge story in wich Bond avenges Tersa [Diana Rigg] who was shot in the final moments of OHMSS. Sadly this wasn't to be. In its place we have the next best thing. Connery is back, the action is more fast and lighter, the sets are bigger and the characters are larger than life. Central to the success of the well written characters is the way in wich they are played, and Diamonds comes up with a killer cast. Charles Gray who was fantastic as a support in You Only Live Twice turns on the charm as a very subdued and eerie Blofeld. Perhaps working against Gray is the fact that the ghost of Telly Savalas, the best of the Blofelds echoes through the movie. Gray however is very comanding and humourous in the movie and it is refreshing to see a different look and style to the character. Equally impressive is Jill St John as Tiffany Case. St John comes over like Lucy from Charles Schultz Peanuts cartoons and in most movies this would seem out of place but gives Diamonds the humourous edge it needs. As efficient as St John is Lana Wood as Plenty O Toole. Wood is beautiful for the part and has a very apealing charm. Manciewicz provides Connery with one of the all time great Bond one-liners in conversation with Wood ""Hi Im Plenty, Plenty O Toole"" exclaims wood ""After your father Perhaps"" inquires Connery. Were as most Bonds give us one hench men, Diamonds gives us two, and homesexual ones at that. Mr Wint and Mr Kidd as portrayed by Bruce Glover and Putter Smith respectively are two of the most original creations of the action movie genre. The come across as some sort of Stoned Laurel and Hardy and again add to the humour and are vicious and nasty creations underneath the fun. Finally there is Jimmy Dean the Country music superstar who turns up here as the Howard Hughes clone Willard Whyte. Dean seems at first out of place in a Bond movie but eventually grows upon you as the humour escelates. Like most Bond movies there is at least one performance that doesn't work : Norman Burton as Felix Leiter. Burton has none of the style and charm Rick Van Nutter had in the role or the appeal that David Hedison would go on to have in future Bond movies. Burton is with out a doubt the worst of all the Leiters.Add to all this the wondeful backdrop of Las Vegas. Vegas contains one of the most flashy glamorous settings for a Bond movie, and it is easy to believe what is going on there. Ken Adams sets are again a joy to marvel at, particularly Blofelds fortress at the movies climax and individual creations like the Moonbuggy, an ugly creation intentionally so. Guy Hamilton gets the direction right with the action sequences, and Connery once again in control of things throws himself enthusiastically into  the role of Bond, more humour from Connery than we have ever seen before, and the action sequences once agin pack the punch. Diamonds however contains quite a few mistakes wich at times is distracting, the one obvious mistake is the sequence in the car chase in Vegas wich see's Bond and Plenty in a red sports car through a narrow alley, in order to fit in the car tilts to one side on its left wheels and an insert shot shows it tilting to its right side. Anyone who has ever tried that knows it is impossible! Mistakes come and go but with the pace so energetic you hardly notice. To support the energetic pace is John Barry's whirling and absorbing themes, a few notches down from them of OHMSS, But still efficient and mesmerising, and there is the traditional theme song, another classic sung with amazing skill by Shirley Bassey {Goldfinger].Diamonds are Forever isn't all plain sailing. The plot of the movie is quite difficult at first to get stuck into, and as the characters a quite fresh and original it is difficult to appreciate them at first but they grow on you with time. The script as with You Only Live Twice has Bond struggling to grasp a space weapon from the hands of Blofeld, wich seems like an old song sung over. Thanks to Tom Manciewicz's fresh and enjoyable screenplay nothing seems tired, and Guy Hamilton milks everything he can from Comic Book/Pop Art humour and action. Manciewicz would later employ as simmilar writing style into Live and Let Die [1973] Superman:The Movie [1978] and Superman II [1980], but it is with Diamonds that he learned his trade. It is quite sad to see Sean Connery in his last official and EON Bond movie. But at least he went out with a bang and not a whimper. Over the years he BECAME Jmaes Bond and if it wasn't for the likes of Roger Moore and Pierce Brosnan the series may have ended with him. Connery is fantastic in Diamonds are Forever, wich is a very enjoyable and well made movie, and a great start for Bond in the 1970's.You know what they say Sean, Never Say Never Again.",Diamonds Are Forever
200,jubilee77,In Old Las Vegas,7,20 October 2009,"Diamonds are Forever was Connery's assignment to reprise the role of James Bond after turning down the earlier starring role of Our Majestry's Secret Service and this was left to George Lazonby. OOMSS may have received mixed reviews but it was clear that Lazonby as Bond was completely lacklustre and it wasn't surprising that he only made one appearance as the super spy while Blofield may been played by different actors such as Donald Pleasance, Telly Savalas and this time, Charles Gray in this 1971 release. Diamonds are Forever is a highly watchable film because there are some excellent choice of locations and my favourite is Las Vegas and the Neveda desert and there is generally good levels of action and the car chases along with the humour and dialogue that adds up. But the film is not without its drawbacks by being a bit dated and it is sometimes lacking the qualities of earlier Connery-era Bond films, being more violent and also a little bit dreary and has also been hampered by production problems. Finally, compared to today's Las Vegas, its hard to imagine what it was like back in 1971 with all those frequent changes that have taken place over the years making it virtually unrecognisable.",Diamonds Are Forever

204,DMP-2,"Not the best, But a very good Bond film that deserves more credit",8,24 December 2000,"This film is excellent. The comedy (which has been the culprit for its discredit) is excellent. This is the first Bond to be uncensored totally. This came out 3 years after the MPAA created the rating system which allow for greater creative control to films.Diamonds Are Forever was the first Bond Film to take it seriously (On Her Majesty's Secret Service, did do this, although few films did in the late 1960's, Planet Of The Apes was Rated G, the sequels went up to PG, which was M at the time).The only thing I don't like about this film is that it should be a revenge film (See my comment on On Her Majesty's Secret Service (1969)and watch it). The end of On Her Majesty's Secret Service clearly shows that Bond should want vengeance, I would if I were in that situation. I think that may have also helped it gain more success, although its did make $44,000,000 upon release, at todays standard thats $180,000,000. It went on to make $116,000,000 worldwide, today thats $480,000,000. Of all the films thats the 4th most profitable.Its evident although a great film, sort of a cult classic, On Her Majesty's Secret Service (1969) jinxed this production. Its evident they wanted to avoid failure, by removing all evidence of it. By forgetting its finale. Also the return of Sean Connery, not only a  addition that would help people for OHMSS, to this film, but also an insult to George Lazenby, who wasn't fired. Lazenby was certainly not better than Connery, but his departure was mistake and a failure. Diamonds Are Forever although to many a failure, is a very good film. But it also helped to make the forgotten Bond film On Her Majesty's Secret Service (1969). In my mind if Diamonds Are Forever failed OHMSS will be remembered, final failure standout. I don't think anyone will forgot how awful BATMAN & ROBIN (1998) was. Although of course now OHMSS wouldn't be a failure. But this film also represented change a change that started after You Only Live Twice and would stop after Live And Let Die (1973) and wouldn't occur again until The Living Daylights (1987), although technically happen early in Sean Connery's second comeback Never Say Never Again (1983).

The man who is behind the plan is Blofeld (Charles Gray), who Bond tries to stop, and also deals with Tiffany Case (Jill St. John) who may be a double agent undercover.It was sad to see this as Sean Connery's last Bond film, but nonetheless, it was still pretty darn good. The story was very interesting as part of it delt with an outer space ordeal and I loved how the film toom place in Las Vegas, seeing as how James Bond likes to gamble at casinos.The acting was again perfect. Once again, Sean Connery was fantastic as Bond, and I wasn't a fan of the new Bond girl, Tiffany. I felt her character was idiotic and amateur. She was the only character that I didn't care for, and was my least favorite Bond girl so far. All the other actors did a pretty smooth job.The action in this one wasn't as awesome as the other Connery ones, but still manages to be pretty entertaining to say the least.All in all, Diamonds are Forever is once more a great James Bond film and a great last one for Mr. Connery.",Diamonds Are Forever
209,tonynworah,Licensed not to thrill,3,28 February 2011,"Diamonds Are Forever is no doubt Sean Connery's worst Bond outing. In Dr. No, Connery was charting in untested waters. It made him tight and wound up. In From Russia With Love, Connery had grown more comfortable in his role and appeared more relaxed than in the movie than its predecessor. With the solid performance of the two movies, Connery had every right to be confident about the Bond franchise and the confidence showed in Goldfinger and Thunderball. That confidence metamorphosed into a slight arrogance in You Only Lie Twice when he announced his intention to resign from the Bond movies.In Diamonds Are Forever, the arrogance became over bloated and Connery's performance was the nonchalance of a sleepwalker who knew that no matter where he walked, he was not going to fall off the cliff. His nonchalance could be understandable. George Lazenby and announced that he will no longer revive the role of 007. The James Bond owners were desperate. They needed someone to reaffirm the Bond fans that Bond was still alive. So they licked their wounds, went back to Connery and paid him US$1.7million which made him the highest paid actor of the year and earned him a spot in Guiness Book of Records as the highest paid actor. Connery also managed to convince them to bankroll two or three movies of his choice.With all this drama, it was no wonder that Connery's performance bordered on conceit. He hardly put in an effort. The energy that drove him in the previous movies was missing. And the plot itself was(shudder!) Diamonds are being smuggled out of the British Mines in South Africa (the apartheid policy is conveniently ignored) at an alarming rate. Bond is sent to discover who is responsible and poses as a diamond smuggler to infiltrate the organization. While doing that, he has to contend with such flamboyant characters like the homosexual hit duo called Mr. Wint and Mr. Kidd, his beautiful handler-Tiffany Case, and a host of other unsavoury characters. Of course, it turns out that his old nemesis, Blofeld is behind the diamond smuggling intending to use the diamonds as a brilliant weapon that will hold nations to ransom.Of course, most Bond plots are completely ridiculous, and DAF falls into that category. But it was not just ridiculous, it was like a parody or spoof of Bond films. And the actors were just behaving like incompetent clowns trying hard to make us laugh.Charles Gray gives a witless performance as Blofeld. Jill St. John was the hapless female is distress who was working for the bad guys until she met Bond and started working for the good guys.All the other regulars were present, Bernard Lee as M, Lois Maxwell as Moneypenny, and always the scene stealer Desmond Llewywn as Q.The film still was a money maker, mainly based on fans excited to see Connery back in the role again.

210,fidelio74,'If at first you don't succeed...',6,2 January 2011,"'Diamonds are Forever' marked the return of Sean Connery as British superspy James Bond for one film. The plot involves diamond smuggling and takes Bond to Las Vegas. His love interest here is Tiffany Case (Jill St. John), and there is terrific support from a pair of homosexual (very risqué for the time - 1971) hit men named Mr. Kidd (Putter Smith) and Mr. Wint (Bruce Glover), and also from Charles Gray as the villain Ernst Stavro Blofeld.As usual, there are plenty of action set pieces on display: a close-quarters fight betwixt Bond and an adversary in an elevator, a splendidly shot car chase through the glittering streets of Vegas, and a helicopter raid upon an oil rig at the film's denouement. This helicopter raid recalls the one on Piz Gloria - where Blofeld had based his headquarters - in 'On Her Majesty's Secret Service'.Sean Connery is in fine form. He is, and always will be, the best Bond and, as a valediction, 'Diamonds are Forever' is pretty good. It is no 'From Russia With Love' but it certainly entertains.

Obviously, the James Bond that Sean portrays is carrying on from where he left off with his portrayal in 'You Only Live Twice' in 1967 and he isn't as melodramatic as would be expected from the events of the previous Bond movie, 'OHMSS'. We are treated to a great car chase in Las Vegas with James getting on the wrong side of American law and order, if you can call it that.Charles Gray turns in a slightly comic portrayal as Blofeld, but is still quite believable as a modern day villain who doesn't care about the disaster he has caused in the life of James Bond, he certainly wants to create more havoc with his attempts at world domination. Jill St. John and Lana Wood are as sexy as ever with the addition of two 'heavy' Bond girls-'Bambi' and 'Thumper'.

213,Reef-Shark,"Campy and dumb, but oh so much fun",5,1 April 2009,"The Seventh entry in the Bond franchise, Diamonds Are Forever follows up On Her Majesty's Secret Service with Sean Connery being pushed back into the role as Agent 007. This would be the last official James Bond film to star Sean Connery, and would be the sixth time the film featured Connery as the title character. It is somewhat a bittersweet ending to Connery's legacy since the film's campy elements seem like they would be more at home in Roger Moore's series of Bond films and not the semi-serious realm of the Connery film. I wouldn't have suspected the director of the classic Goldfinger to come back with such a campy entry in the series.The film is very fun to watch and probably has some of Connery's best comic one-liners (""It seems you've caught me with more than my hands up"") and is amusing to watch, but it suffers in so many other aspects. It really does usher in the 70s Bond before Moore even enters the picture and whether that's good or bad is up to the viewer to decide. If you are a fan of the Roger Moore Bond films you will probably like Diamonds Are Forever, but if you're expecting a more serious, Connery Bond film on the level of Thunderball or Goldfinger you'll most certainly be disappointed. Even though Connery stars this really is essentially the first ""Moore"" Bond film.That being said I found this movie very entertaining, if not up to the standards of Connery's other five films. Diamonds Are Forever may be a dopey film in premise, but it's an incredibly amusing film that you should just go along with.If you don't want campy Bond just avoid this movie, but if you're like me and enjoy most of the Bond films you will probably enjoy the lunacy that is Diamonds Are Forever.",Diamonds Are Forever
214,jonny_mcclatch,Weirdest film for Connery to have gone out on...,7,4 February 2020,"Ok so the studio were apparently quite desperate to have Connery back for this one and he does seem rather well aged and reluctant in this one. On top of that it seems to introduce Roger Moore's style of sillier humour to the franchise which isn't a bad thing but it certainly wasn't Sean Connery's Bond. Another weird choice was changing Blofeld's character yet again and not only that they cast the same actor who played Mr Henderson just two films ago.With all of that considered the film is still a lot of fun, it's a bit quirky and a lot less serious than any of the previous films. But there's a lot to like about it, it has a memorable cast of henchmen and Las Vegas is simply gorgeous to look at especially the scenes at night. The action is entertaining, even the moon buggy sequence was good fun. The plot is quite basic, smuggling diamonds for a satellite which is used to hold the world at ransom. It still maintains the same style and swagger any Bond film should have, i'm not a huge Jill St. John fan but she plays the role quite well. Lana Wood was sold a little short, she makes a short but memorable appearance before it skips an important bit of her story and she ends up in a pool for the second time in the film. Having seen some outtakes and heard a little more about what original script contained it's a shame they didn't keep more of her story, it would have added a little extra.",Diamonds Are Forever
215,tomasg-69814,Sean's been bought back.,5,25 January 2016,"After the flaws with George Lazenby, and his unwilling mood to sign for more 007 jobs, the team bought back one Sean Connery for record money.Well, his work here feels a little bit uninspired - sometimes he seems to get in a light mood, and play it for laughs. Maybe I had done that myself, knowing that the 007-stage door was to be closed for good after this.They actually tried to buy him back once again for ""Live And Let Die"". (Connery this time demanded way out fantasy money, and was never considered.)This is not as much a legendary classic as his 60's flicks, but good entertainment on the way, with the Vegas environment and so. But the ""avenging his murdered wife"" thing could have been developed, and stretched out for a while. That part is treated very shallow, almost just skin-deep, I think. The vicious planning of blackmailing the world (via a laser-gun satellite) from Blofeld is wearisome - feels like a flimsy development of the Virus Omega in OHMSS, and the hijacking of spaceships in YOLT - and Charles Gray's portrait of him isn't that memorable at all. The whole movie seems to me pretty flashy and airy compared to it's forerunners, but hey, the 70's just begun....the decade when sideburns and flares was to rule the world for a while. Red super-car (Ford Mustang Mach I) and red head girl (Jill St. John) adorns the movie good, but feels a little second grade still, to what we could have been presented if they had used some more skill in the script plans.I place this Bond movie somewhere in the lower-middle ranking among all the others, but can very well bear to revisiting it when it somehow comes in my way from time to time.

After the artistic peak of OHMSS, this film seems like it belongs to another franchise altogether--maybe Shaft?The script is terrible, the jokes fall flat, the lighting is horrid, Connery looks 65, and the film has lost all the polish and grit of the 60s film series. Its clear that the story is just scaffolding for the action. Connery breaks into a set for a moon landing and then steals a moon car thing and spends the next 15 minutes being chased by goons. Why exactly?

217,gerard-21,"""Definitely Distinctive""",9,21 January 2003,"This is the strangest Bond film of all, and as such, probably has the most polarized reviews. People either hate or love this one. Personally, I've always liked it. I think detractors get caught up on too many superficial things, like the few moments of juvenile humor, and don't appreciate this film for what it is: a very stylish, moody and weird romp. They also incorrectly assume that, because Sean Connery was coming back one time only for a fantastic sum of money, that his heart wasn't in it. In fact, as real critics have often said, he gives his best and most relaxed performance as Bond since Goldfinger. Logic would tell you that he wanted to go out in style, especially since he was so wooden his last time out in You Only Live Twice. It's not his fault the lines written didn't conjure up the seriousness of From Russia With Love. This film is vastly different from what preceded it, so some didn't like the change. But they're the ones missing out, because there are many memorable scenes and characters. This movie is not about action and gadgets, but about the surreal interaction between the characters. One has to go no further than the opening pipeline sequence to see that. Furthermore, the dialogue is terrific, and one has to watch the movie over and over to grasp all the ingenious lines. ""Providing the collars and cuffs match"" and I'm afraid you caught me with more than my hands up"" are some of the best phrases ever uttered in a bond film. The characters themselves were equally fascinating. Wint & Kidd set the pace for the strange goings-on and are a refreshing break from all the strong-armed assassins (Jaws, Odd-Job) that seem to appear in the majority of bond films. Anyway, you don't see Mike Myers lampooning them in his Austin Powers series. And if you want realism, the fight with Peter Franks ranks right up there. A chunky and older Jill St. John is much more believable as a worldly feme-fatale than the parade of twenty-somethings we're typically presented with (Denise Richards, Tonya Roberts, etc...). And where is it written that the main Bond villain has to be someone as two-fisted as Bond? Charles Grey's Blofeld fits right in with the craziness, and at least he seems intellectually capable of taking on Bond and the world, as opposed to Donald Pleasance's spoiled-brat and Telly Savalas' New York gangster Blofelds. And for once, we can see where the protagonist's resources came from! (I won't go into details, because it would have to contain spoilers). Sure the action on the oil rig at the end is somewhat disappointing, but that's not what this film is about. The scene aboard the QEII at the very end (""Mouton Rothschild is a claret"")is more emblematic of the mood the film makers were trying to convey. In conclusion, if you don't watch this movie expecting a Bond action extravaganza, but concentrate on the characters and dialogue, you'll thoroughly enjoy it.",Diamonds Are Forever
218,d-apergis,curiously short on action,6,23 December 2009,"A Bond outing that is curiously short on action and one which is often criticized by Bond-enthusiasts as being responsible for the lighter tone that has been subsequently prevalent in the series. It is not without its merits: It does have some of the wittiest exchanges in the series, Hamilton's direction and Adam's production design ensure some definitive Bond moments, Barry's score is top-notch, and Connery exudes his usual authority. But the film has only a couple of cursory car chases and an anticlimactic climax to complement it, which is a pretty humble deal in comparison to the extravagance of its predecessor. Additionally, the Las Vegas setting feels rather dull, failing to offer much scope for adventure. In all, though not bad, the film somewhat compulsively refuses to elevate itself into a higher plane. Strange.",Diamonds Are Forever
219,spinin,"The return of Sean Connery, a change in direction, and the first in an odd trilogy",7,12 July 2021,"Sean Connery returns as James Bond to investigate a mysterious diamond smuggling operation. Along the way he teams up with Tiffany Case (Jill St. John) as the trail leads him to Las Vegas and once again to his ultimate nemesis, Ernst Stavro Blofeld (Charles Gray).With On Her Majesty's Secret Service, the glory days of the 60s era James Bond came to an end. The previous film was a box-office failure and the underwhelming George Lazenby left after just one movie. The producers scrambled and got Sean Connery to return thanks to a big paycheck. Though Connery returned, the series took on a decidedly new look and direction.With a screenplay written by Tom Mankiewicz, Diamonds is more of an outright comedy than any other Bond film in the official series. At times it feels as cheap as the Vegas setting, but it works quite well for a number of reasons. It's a funny movie, almost a spoof, with very strong and witty dialogue. Connery is better here than in You Only Live Twice, has a lot of fun with the ridiculous plot, and is able to adjust to the lighthearted tone of the film without making James Bond too serious this time around. And his performance is appropriate for the slightly more aged Bond.The Bond girls, including Tiffany Case and Plenty O'Toole (Lana Wood) are funny as well, as is Charles Gray's version of Blofeld. I happen to like Gray's performance here, even though he is frequently ranked as the worst of all the Blofelds. He is pompous, but intelligent, and fits very well within the satirical tone of the film. And of course, the film features the oddest duo of homosexual henchmen assassins, Mr. Wint (Bruce Glover) and Mr. Kidd (Putter Smith). Though the film may have gone a bit too far with the somewhat buffoon-like Vegas tycoon Willard Whyte (Jimmy Dean).The film doesn't feature any truly memorable action, but it moves quickly and focuses on clever dialogue, which is probably the sharpest in the series. It has a Goldfinger-like feel, without the expansiveness. There is a great elevator fight scene and a cool stunt featuring a Ford Mustang, and a lot of chuckles along the way. As cheap entertainment, it under-promises and overdelivers.This was the first of three films in a row written by Mankiewicz, with Live and Let Die and The Man With the Golden Gun being the other two. It ushered in a lower budget Bond era. All three feature bizarre characters, more focus on dark and sometimes slapstick humor, somewhat more competent Bond girls, and odd, at times almost surreal plots. They aren't the strongest films in the series, and in fact almost brought it to an end. However, I consider them middle-tier Bond and in moments they can be more interesting and fun than the more traditional, and somewhat more predictable Bond films. Connery gives a fine final performance helping take the series in this new, uneven, and strange direction and pave the way for his replacement, Roger Moore.",Diamonds Are Forever
220,jackhamel1987,Hmmm?,6,7 April 2013,"I think that Diamonds are Forever is an example of a production team who had all the gear and no idea, in that they had a big budget, Connery back as Bond and any number of plots to pick. Instead of picking one plot and sticking to it, this film turns into a bit of a camp mess. It's saving grace is that it's fun. There isn't much else to it than that!James Bond is hot on the trail of Blofeld, who murdered his wife. I have often wondered what would have been made of this film had George Lazenby stayed with the franchise. It could have been a far more personal mission of revenge. As it, this film gets lost in trying to do too many things. Is it about the revenge of his wife? Not entirely. Is it about Blofeld? A bit. Diamond smuggling? Here and there? Space? Yep, but just at the end. It even has the classic scientist who wants 'world peace', and yet another side story about a missing Howard Hughes type tycoon and two of the most bizarre henchmen in any film, let alone a Bond film. In a nutshell, this is about Blofeld smuggling diamonds to make a space laser beam to destroy military establishments. But there is so much going on, with so many characters, that it simply never works. The lost and far-reaching plot, mixed with the overly camp humour, poor Bond girls and the feeling that Connery just didn't care make this a bit of a mess, that just happens to somehow entertain on some level. There are some great action scenes here and there, but in my mind, this is one of the poorer Bond films, with the exception of the great signature tune by Shirley Bassey. This could have and should have been so much more than it was. The producers needed to either focus on the diamond smuggling, or (as I think), they needed to make this a more personal Bond where Bond avenges the death of his wife. Had Lazenby stayed, I think it would have been different. He didn't, Connery came back, and it just didn't work out because they made it for the wrong reasons. I'm glad for everyone's sake that Bond moved on from Connery at this stage. Good for an afternoon with beer and crisps and a laugh, but not for anything else. 6/10.",Diamonds Are Forever
221,BrohmaBull007,Connery Is Back,5,13 March 2006,In this thriller of a James Bond movie we get the return of Sean Connery after skipping a movie. This movie was action packed to an extreme. Usually Bond movies slow down a bit to build up the tension but we get none of that here. Bond is in Las Vegas and the location is used to its every advantage. The redhead that is Tiffany Case plays a good tough girl with that high maintenance touch. Connery delivers twice as many one-liners as before giving this movie a comedic touch. Blofed is a very powerful villain and he is one of the best Bond villains to date. This movie also gives us the somewhat legendary henchmen of Mr. Wynt and Mr. Kidd. They provide some classic moments when they face Bond and when they finish each others puns and old sayings. They truly made this film the comedic masterpiece that it is. This movie took a different turn with more comedy and more action while still keeping the plot together. That is what I find fun about this movie. Bambi and Thumper are 2 vixens who know how to put up a great action sequence. Connery sadly looks older in this movie than I expected. He looks like he is 45 and I was shocked to find out he was only 40. I also think Connery might have soiled his reputation by returning for an huge sum of money. Plenty O'Toole was a pointless character that didn't even deserve ANY screen time. Overall if you've always wanted to see Bond with a little more action then I think this is the Bond movie for you. 7/10,Diamonds Are Forever
222,trekfan2001,One of the better Bonds,8,14 June 2003,"Sure it isn't as serious as some of the other Bond films, but I found it very enjoyable. If you take Bond films so seriously that you can't enjoy Diamonds Are Forever, then maybe you should stop watching the Bond films and find a realistic espionage drama.DAF features some of the best one liners in the series and it has some of the strangest characters. However, I think one of the main problems with DAF is the over-use of Blofeld in the Bond films. After three films in a row with him as the main villan, he was getting way beyond his use by date and the character was just becoming stale. I also think the special effects were very ordinary and easily the worst in any Bond film.Anyway, I would rate it at 8/10. Highly enjoyable, but not the best Bond.",Diamonds Are Forever
223,roland-sinn,The first Bond film where JB really started to have fun.,8,19 August 2003,"I don't think it's any surprise why Diamonds is a favourite Bond film of so many people (it's certainly achieved considerable cult status in Australia). The first entry for 007 in the 70s was very different from all of the 60s Bond films. It had to be. The 60s were dead and the Bond franchise had to update fast to remain in step with society.In all of the 60s Bond flicks there's a distinct element of darkness below the surface of quip dialogue, fast cars, gadgets and pretty bikinied bodies. Diamonds set out to entertain in a light and fluffy yet more risque manner than any of the previous Bond films. Sean Connery left the Bond franchise behind in 1967 to pursue a serious acting career. But when Australia's own George Lasenbury decided not to do another Bond film after On Her Majesty's Secret Service' (big, big mistake on George's part) Sean had to be brought back in to save the production of Diamonds.Throughout the film, Sean wears a sardonic smile. His whole demeanor says: Look, I'm only back because I'm being paid a million dollars'. Frankly, this works on screen very well. Sean looks older, rougher, more world weary and ready to take the role with a good pinch of salt.Jill St John makes for a fantastic heroin. She plays a vastly different leading lady role to the Bond chicks of the 60s. She's a smart alec, wise cracking, hard nosed so and so. Her relationship with Sean is great  more brother/sister than romantic. It's great to see a woman busy with her own strong agenda; she's more interested in getting what she wants rather than submitting to Bond's incomparable charm'.As for the hired killers  they rank as the best villainous henchmen of the entire franchise on par with Odd Job' from Gold Finger. They are a seriously camp and disturbed pair.The producers of Diamonds were either extremely intelligent or just damned lucky that they decided to use and abuse dozens of cars in a variety of smash'em'up chases and stunts. The Moon buggy chase through the desert and the police chase through Downtown Las Vegas are two of the funnest ever filmed and certainly inspired numerous copies throughout the 70s.On a final note, if you are a person who hasn't ever seen a Bond film before (and I've met first hand a couple of these unfortunate souls), Diamonds is probably the best of the 20 to start with.8/10",Diamonds Are Forever
224,A_Friend_of_Sarah_Connor,Too comedic to take seriously (SPOILERS),4,15 October 2004,"By the early 1970's, some people thought that James Bond was destined to be stuck in the previous decade. George Lazenby certainly thought so, and after one film, ""On Her Majesty's Secret Service"", he bailed the franchise on the advice of his agent. The public, apparently, also agreed with Lazenby, because while OHMSS was definitely successful (every Bond film has been), it didn't do as well as Sean Connery's previous outings. This probably had to do with Connery himself not being involved with the film, so with this in his mind, producer Cubby Broccoli sought to it that his star come back.Long story short, Connery eventually agreed to star in ""Diamonds Are Forever"". The film itself, to be blunt, is terrible, and the first real indication that Eon was getting sloppy with their execution. I won't go much into the plot because, well, there really isn't one. The film loosely follows the superior and much too maligned novel of the same name, except it adds doubles for Blofeld (played far too passively by Charles Gray, who at one point lets Bond go so he can put him in another pointless death trap when he can just shoot him right then and there!), misplaced satellites in space, diamond double-crosses that serve no purpose beyond leading Bond to Vegas, stupid characters, etc. And when we do (kind of) figure out the plan, it comes as a huge disappointment.Done right, all of this might have made for some kind of entertainment, but it all piles on until the end, when the audience it left scratching their heads and trying to make some kind of sense of the whole affair, which is of course pointless because even the filmmakers don't seem to have an idea of what's going on. So if the story is a let-down, the action must make up for it, right? Unfortunately, all the action scenes in DAF are all similar and dull. They're played mostly for laughs, too, which kills any tension that was possible. This is most obvious in the Las Vegas car chase. Of all the films, ""Diamonds Are Forever"" is surely one of the most boring and cheap-looking, with even the Ken Adam sets not matching those of the past or the future. I blame it on director Guy Hamilton, whose chases and general style didn't even come close to most other directors in the Bond canon.What's left, then? The special effects are humiliating and way too distracting. Are you telling me every explosion creates a puff of dust and then quickly disappears like an over-heated oven? Even with Connery's large pay-check taking away a large sum of the budget, these effects are embarrassing. The locations are pretty lifeless, especially the main one of Las Vegas. As I mentioned, the characters are not only boring and artificial, but the actors themselves don't bring their all, even the ""all-mighty"" Connery, who looks much, MUCH older than in ""You Only Live Twice"" and is suitably bored with the proceedings,only rarely showing the flair that he did in the previous entries.Take the ending, for example, where he strolls onto the oil rig looking like he can stop Blofeld's evil plot in no time (not that Bond even understands what's going on anyway.) Continuing with characters, two deserve singling out. Jimmy Dean as Willard Whyte, while having a blast, is completely out of place while Tiffany Case starts out as intelligent, but turns into a bumbling fool by the end who is unbelievable as an expert diamond smuggler. Probably the only characters in the film that are remotely interesting are Mister Wint and Mister Kidd, played by Bruce Glover and Putter Smith. The two make a great killer duo, and play off of each other well. Not to mention they look like they're having the time of their lives and give a believable performance at the same time. The movie has very little going for it except a haunting and memorable score from John Barry, some of the best lines in the series, and a unique fight in an elevator that seems to be one of the only things that Connery really gets into! If you're looking for a serious, grand adventure, this one isn't for you. It'll provide a few cheap laughs, but by the end you'll wonder why you bothered sitting through 2 hours of this mess. Just because it's the 7th film, doesn't mean that it's lucky. 3.5/10",Diamonds Are Forever
225,asdodge,"Connery Goes Out, with a Splash",7,12 December 2008,"This is not the most favored Bond flick, however, it is not a bad film at all. Bond is asked to investigate a diamond operation and eventually uncovers a supervillain plot to blackmail the world by Spectre. The plot is fine, except for the use and portrayal of lasers (ahh, to have had the internet and research back then). Connery, however, has aged... the stress and hassles of being Bond once more and aging make him a little less impressive, and the script seems more suited to a Lazenby or Moore than to Connery. Supposedly to regain the American audiences lost when ""OHMSS"" did not do as well in US box offices, the film is based entirely in the USA and many famous American bit actors appear. (oddly enough, ""Live and let Die"" - the first Moore film, is also heavy in US locations). The movie follows the standard formula begun with 'Goldfinger"" and could even be called a re-make of it- just substitute the lust for gold with the need for diamonds.Connery gives a fine performance as Bond... dialoguing as well as he ever has- he just looks tired and out of shape (which, considering the movie begins with his seeking revenge for the loss of his one and only wife- Tracy, who was gunned down in the previous movie works in the plot at first.)The movie has taken undo criticism for homophobia in the portrayal of two assassins- actually, it was rather brave to even suggest it, as homosexuality was not a truly open topic for the movie audience this was aimed at (even ""Midnight Cowboy"" got the ""X"" rating for its subtle yet frank depiction of male and gay prostitution). The two characters are humorous, but claims they play to stereotypes are misfounded. Neither plays the more familiar campy queen hair-stylist/interior decorator homosexual often mocked in comedy. Both are efficient killers. Bond movies had already hinted at homosexuality twice before (Col. Kleb in ""From Russia With Love"" makes extremely subtle advances on Tanya and Pussy Galore and her troupe were all supposed to be lesbians, as in the novel), but it was forced to be subtler or implied. In DAF, they push the envelope and make no doubts as to the orientation. Again, the criticism is unjust.Anyhow, in this story, Bond is asked to investigate an apparent diamond smuggling operation that is leaving a trail of corpses from South Africa to las Vegas. Bond comes across one Tiffany Case who seems to be a ringleader for the smuggling operation and slowly gets her to start helping him. As Bond delves into this mystery further, however, he uncovers a plot to use a diamond-based laser gun in orbit to blackmail the world into paying a ransom. All this circles around the industries of a recluse billionaire, Willard Whyte. Bond eventually discovers that it is Blofeld and SPECTRE up to their tricks again and must stop them and save Willard Whyte.The weakest point is the Jill St. John character, Tiffany Case. Set up at the start of the film as a key cog in a smuggling operation, self-assured and intelligent, by the end of the picture she has become another bouncing Bond bikini-clad bimbo, clumsy and silly. Had she been a more consistent portrayal, the movie would have been even better. Country singer and sausage king Jimmy Dean plays ""Willard Whyte""- a casino owner and billionaire based on Howard Hughes. He comes off a bit of a country bumpkin; he's is okay, but he could have been better.The usual special effects, innovative chases, wonderful camera work is all here. A fine effort with a couple of weak spots that might make one cringe here or there, but Connery hangs up his license to kill very well.",Diamonds Are Forever
226,theonewithallthecontacts,My pic for the worst Bond movie ever...,4,5 December 2012,"After the ""box office disappointment"" of On Her Majesty's Secret Service compared to the earlier Bond films, and Lazenby leaving the role of James Bond after just one movie, the producers were yet to decide where to take the next Bond flick! The answer was simple: to make another movie just like Goldfinger!Guy Hamilton, the director of Goldfinger, were brought back to direct ""Diamonds Are Forever"" the eighth Bond movie overall, and the seventh EON Bond film to be made. The movie was based on Ian Fleming's fourth James Bond novel of the same name. After Lazenby had bowed out of the series, the producers went to Sean Connery waving with a huge paycheck, and Connery eventually agreed to return as James Bond! So we had Guy Hamilton and Sean Connery back in action! What could possibly go wrong? The movie itself is the answer to that question...The movie starts out with Bond hot on the trail of Blofeld... like in the previous movie. Bond is eager to get revenge on Blofeld, in return for Bond's dead wife. We are just thrown into the plot with no explanation. The pre-credit sequence isn't exiting at all... it's just a rushed little revenge story, that doesn't really work very well. The rest of the movie centers around an international diamond smuggling ring, that Bond is meant to infiltrate and in the end... follow the trail of the diamonds. It's not a bad plot. But the movie quickly pulls you away from all of that and begins to concentrate about random stuff like James Bond in a circus and Blofeld dressing in drag. It's just so dumb and lame that I don't even want to comment more on that. In the end the plot is decent, but the execution is lame and dumb.Sean Connery returns for his sixth and last appearance as James Bond, and even he is lacking! He just seems bored like never before, and he was really to old to play the part at that age! But I don't blame him. Connery had clearly moved on from the role of James Bond, and while it was a shame, it's also fair. Connery had already given us 5 remarkable and fantastic performances as James Bond, and he created probably the most beloved character in cinema history! It's a shame that he finished his Bond era with this piece of crap! But Sean Connery is Sean Connery, and the stars I have given this movie is most to his glory! Jill St. John plays Tiffany Case and she has got to be one of the worst Bond girls ever. She can't act, and her chemistry with Connery just seems awkwardly out of place. At least she is very beautiful! Charles Gray (who also played Dikko Henderson in You Only Live Twice) is our main villain, Ernst Stavro Blofeld. And he sucks! Don't get me wrong, Gray is a good actor but he should have been remembered for his supporting role in You Only Live Twice, and not for this! This movie is the absolute low point for the character of Blofeld. Gray's Blofeld is just some jerk, with a big and cheesy cowboy smile on his face, who clones himself. Hell, he even wears drag in this movie! This is not the epic Blofeld we were introduced to in the previous James Bond- outings! Lana Wood plays Plenty O'Toole, and boy is she sexy and also weak. Her acting is non-existent and so is her chemistry with Connery! Bruce Glover and Putter Smith is the homosexual henchmen of the film. Their portrayals are a bit homophobic, but as villains they're creepy enough, I suppose. They're OK. Norman Burton is fourth and the worst Felix Leiter ever to have been portrayed. Burton basically created a comedic character that wasn't funny. We do have the awesome trio Bernard Lee, Desmond Llewelyn and Lois Maxwell returning, respectively.Diamonds Are Forever is one of those movies, that I don't have anything particular nice to say about. It's just so dumb. And while some movies are dumb but kind of entertaining (Moonraker and Die Another Day) this one isn't even the slightest entertaining. So it's both dumb, bland and boring. There isn't even a single character in the movie that I like, except for James Bond and all of the other recurring characters! Guy Hamilton seems to have completely forgotten how to make a good Bond movie! Goldfinger is probably my favorite Bond movie, while this is definitely my least favorite! There's a big difference considering they both come from the same director! How this movie has a higher rating on IMDb than License To Kill is beyond my imagination! But it is a Bond movie, and I have a very strong ""bond"" to the movies, so I always kind of enjoy watching it even though I still hate it. The movie has aged well, you could say. I just love the Bond universe that much. So if you're a hardcore fan then check it out (some actually do love it), but if you're a casual viewer, then you should by all means skip it!4/10",Diamonds Are Forever

The producers should've been ashamed of themselves to tarnish the name of this series with this miserable dreck of a Bond movie. This is a sub par Bond movie and is about as terrible as the Pierce Brosnan Bond movies after Goldeneye, Octopussy, A View To A Kill and the other routine garbage that unfortunately comprised much of the period between 1971 and 2002. If you're a fan of the Bond movies of the 60s or of the Daniel Craig movies, I strongly suggest skipping this trainwreck.",Diamonds Are Forever
228,ianbrown65,"Right idea, Mr Bond. Wrong pussy...",7,1 May 2012,"A greying Connery returns for an enjoyable but only occasionally 18-carat entry, his last for the Eon Bonds. Jill St John makes a gutsy heroine and Charles Gray the iciest and best of the Blofelds. But the gags are overdone (and would be from now on) and the ending weak.The producers also brought back director Guy Hamilton but the untidy screenplay doesn't allow for the polish of his earlier 'Goldfinger'. A tight shooting schedule, a contractual condition by Connery, explains the somewhat hurried look of 'Diamonds are Forever' (the drainpipe sequence, for instance, is so shoddily cut it seems assembled from discarded outtakes).And yet all the elements of a great Bond thriller are here. A mysterious hi-tech desert installation, a hidden jungle surgery complete with bubbling sulphur-pit, a car-chase along the Las Vegas Strip (that admittedly seemed more daring then than now), a world-threatening plot, a wonderfully tense confrontation between 007 and two Blofelds in a stainless steel penthouse. Unfortunately, that's really the last interesting sequence in the film.Despite the introduction of the laser-satellite, it loses what narrative verve it has and the subsequent events aren't charged with enough urgency. The final set-piece battle is a disappointment; a converted oil rig of the Californian coast hardly provides for a very spectacular climax or a memorable interior set to focus the action on. In fact, the satellite control-room must be about the least inspired set that designer Ken Adams has ever come up with. And some of the explosion effects are glaringly poor.What a pity. Because John Barry comes up with yet another distinctively superb score, memorably the harsh discordant sax for the desert sequences that also acts as the recurring musical leit motif for the murderous gay couple Mr Wint and Mr Kidd, as well as that clamorous, piercing piece with piccolos that accompanies the fight scenes. And cinematographer Ted Moore well captures the neon-hard local colour and the arid starkness of the hinterland, noticeably in the very high angle shot of Bond's red Ford trailing Metz' minibus out of Las Vegas into the desert.The real pleasure of the film is Connery, though. If the trim figure that began nine years earlier has gone, along with the muscle-tone, he's more relaxed and assured than ever in in a role that by now fits him like a glove, despite a five-year absence.The role is his, absolutely, and he knows it.",Diamonds Are Forever
229,wmennisny-617-254276,A True CLASSIC.,8,27 November 2015,"I love Diamonds Are Forever. It's the best sort of time-capsule and thoroughly entertaining. I've always been a fan of the more understated Bond films, meaning I tend towards the earlier ones with fewer extraneous explosions and more locations. Here we are taken to Amsterdam and especially Las Vegas. I love the scenes shot in the casino! The era of wood paneling is long gone but I love revisiting! Can anyone imagine a performer like ""Shady Tree"" today? One of my favorite puns is in the name of ""Plenty O'Toole"" - it's a riot! The direction is really spot-on as well. The scenes in the crematorium are amazing and eerie. The plot IS a bit off balance but that doesn't distract from the fun. The ending, as with most Bond films, if predictable but at least it doesn't linger too long. Jill St. John is a bit wooden at times but in the end just manages to pull it off and is very nice to look at. Sean is in fine form throughout. The score (aside from the title song with neither I nor Harry Saltzman liked) is very good. One of the most entertaining films you'll ever see and in the end it's about being well entertained.",Diamonds Are Forever
230,mcfische,The biggest flop in the series yet,5,14 August 2003,"May contain spoilersWatching the 007 films in order, I found that ""Diamonds are Forever"" is the lowest point in the series at this time. The film wasn't completely terrible; it had it's good points. However, after OHMSS, my favorite of the Bond films, this film fails to live up to ""Majesty's"" high standards.Of course, one must keep in mind that at it's initial release, OHMSS was the second-lowest grossing Bond film, although not a box-office failure. Audiences didn't bother giving the film a chance, instead complaining of the absence of Sean Connery. The press didn't help, as they gave a false image of George Lazenby who, after bad advice from his agent and supervisor, backed out of the role of 007. Sean Connery was lured back into this film with his salary higher than the budget of ""Dr. No,"" but this couldn't have been a worse farewell performance for him. His age isn't as obvious as some have said; for the most part, he looks the same as in ""You Only Live Twice."" But his performance isn't right. At the beginning of the film, he is hunting down Blofeld, beating up everyone who has a lead on him until he gets information. He finds his nemesis changing his appearance yet again and creating a double of himself through plastic surgery. Bond stops the procedure and supposedly kills his nemesis. But WHY is he hunting Blofeld? The logical answer is the murder of his wife in the last film; there are several indications. Bond is dead-set on finding Blofeld, M states that 007 has been focusing on nothing else, and when Moneypenny asks for a wedding ring, rather than smiling and immediately replying, Bond looks rather disturbed by the comment. But it is never stated why Bond is after Blofeld.After Bond kills Blofeld, he goes to Vegas to stop a diamond smuggling operation. The people who handle the diamonds are killed off by homosexual killers Mr. Wint and Mr. Kidd. I had no problems with them being homosexual as it is not the most obvious thing in the movie. But when Bond kills Peter Franks and Tiffany Case, the new Bond girl, thinks Franks is James Bond, why is she so surprised. Bond is a SECRET agent from BRITIAN! So far the only people who know Bond is a 00 agent are those who have secret links and friends in high places (the only ones like that are SPECTRE and Draco, Tracy's father.) I don't think Felix Lieter would leak information like that into the public of a country like America. And speaking of Felix, he is totally out of character in this film. Rather than being the understanding friend of James that he was in the other films, he now is too serious and business-like. Tiffany Case, and indeed, every other woman in this film, have no personality and are just appendages to the story line. After a woman like Tracy in OHMSS, you'd think they would come up with women at least a LITTLE like the closest Bond girl to Tracy, Pussy Galore (I say Pussy because Bond said he'd never find another girl like Tracy.)And finally, Blofeld. He had three doubles, and the opening of the film has Bond kill two. He kills the other, and the real one is left alive. This Blofeld is much more of a whiner and more talkative then the calm, ruthless Blofeld of YOLT, or the charming, tough Blofeld of OHMSS. His plan will be copied twice in future Bond films, with a minor difference. Blofeld's satellite, encrusted with diamonds, is a laser that he uses to hold the U.S. for ransom, at what price I don't remember. The film's plot is rather dull and lacks the same kind of excitement and lavish feel of previous Bond outings. The opening teaser should've been M, Q, and Moneypenny looking over 007's work since Tracy's death and finding a lead on Blofeld, and THEN they could mix in the diamond smuggling with Bond's search for Blofeld. Donald Pleasance or Telly Savalas should've played Blofeld, and George Lazenby should've played 007. Q's hair went too white from OHMSS and DAF, when not even a year seems to have passed. And at the end, before the action starts, Tiffany sounds like she'll propose marriage, and Bond is in no way looking glum, uncomfortable, or with a look that says ""no,"" and there should be one on his face.The film does have it's good points, however. I did enjoy Willard Whyte. He's a good comedic character. So is Plenty O' Toole, even if she is annoying. And Sean Connery doesn't play the part right for a man after the one who killed his wife, but the way he plays it is good.This film was supposed to mark a turning point in the OO7 films. Rather than the ruthless, dark agent of Connery, the Roger Moore era of a light-hearted, witty Bond was coming, and this film was supposed to launch it. Instead, it isolates itself from the series and turns out dull. They should've done it in the style of OHMSS, and THEN let ""Live and Let Die"" introduce Moore and his era. This film gets a 3 1/2 out of 10.",Diamonds Are Forever
231,vgamerdc,Diamonds Are Forever (1971) Review,7,21 December 2013,"The first Bond movie of the 70's and you can already tell a difference in the picture as well as color. In this film we have the return of Sean Connery for one last film, which is because of hatred the viewers gave to On Her Majesty's Secret Service, staring George Lazenby. It is also because of that film that this review may get a better score than it might deserve, being the follow-up to that catastrophe. Please click the link above to read my raging review.Anyways, I found this film to be actually pretty good, especially compared to its predecessor (I'm going to try to not keep bashing On Her Majesty's Secret Service, but I might just not be able to help myself.) I most of it, but there were still some goofy elements added to it. For example — oh, and if you haven't seen this 42 year old movie, then sorry for spoilers — when Bond steals the space/moon driving machine and the bad guys send 3 cars (who fail to catch Bond) and 3 motorcycles (who also fail) and the scene goes on for a good 5-7 minutes, it's hard to keep a straight face.Anyways, I didn't like how the actors playing Blowfelt — I finally figured out his name but referred to him as Dr. Evil in my previous reviews — kept changing. This guy wasn't the same as the Blowfelt in You Only Live Twice but hey AT LEAST HE WAS BETTER THAN THE GUY IN ON HER MAJESTY'S SECRET SERVICE!Anyway, his performance was good and I enjoyed how he created a double of himself.Another part of this movie that I loved was Mr. Wint and Mr. Kid. They played really good roles and I enjoyed their performance. I feel like Mr. Wint was one of those guys who would be saying something like, ""Boy, this building is quite high up. It would be a shame if someone were to fall off.""I give Diamonds Are Forever a 7.5 out of 10 for having the return of Sean Connery, characters like Mr. Wint and Kid, and just being a fun film. Some of the lines and chases are silly, but hey, AT LEAST IT'S NOT AS BAD AS. Well, you already know what I'm going to say.",Diamonds Are Forever

This film has a darker tone with Bond going after Blofeld for vengeance of his wife being murdered on their wedding day, the characters Mr. Wint and Mr. Kidd who are ruthless assassins who never fail.

234,Orpington,Weak and tacky official farewell for Connery,4,31 July 2003,"After the relative commercial failure of On Her Majesty's Secret Service, and the subsequent departure of the unlamented George Lazenby, the Bond producers were desperate to lure Sean Connery back for just one more outing as James Bond. Connery was reluctant, but the huge sum he was offered to come back was too good to resist, and Diamonds are Forever thus became his last official Bond film. Sadly it is a thoroughly unworthy exit, for DAF is an inane, flabby film that suffers from lazy scripting and an excess of camp humour, reducing Bond to the level of self-parody.It seems that the aim of this film was to rekindle the spirit of Goldfinger, after audiences did not take kindly to the relatively serious OHMSS. Not only did Connery return, but so did Goldfinger director Guy Hamilton and other crew members who had worked on that film; even Shirley Bassey was back to sing the theme tune, which is one of the few good things about DAF. However, it lacks either the wit or elegance of Goldfinger, relying instead on a succession of bad puns and tedious chase sequences, including a particularly stupid one which sees Bond being pursued across the desert while driving a moon buggy. The decision to set most of the film in Las Vegas does not help matters, for it is a very un-Bond like place which just serves to make the film feel even more cheap and tacky.The casting is a mixed bag. Connery never gave a bad performance as OO7, but he is at his most detached and uninterested here, going through the motions but never looking as if he is doing it for anything other than the money. Even though he was only 40 when he made it, he also looks rather old in this film, which does not help credibility. Charles Gray is OK as Blofeld, but plays it far too camp and never seems the slightest bit menacing, which is not a good idea if you are playing Bond's arch-enemy. Jill St John's Tiffany Case is a spirited Bond girl, but unaccountably she becomes more and more stupid as the film goes on, and never becomes as strong a character as she should have been. Wint and Kidd, Blofeld's homosexual henchmen, provide quite good comic value, even though they are outrageous gay stereotypes; nevertheless, their antics seem very out of place in a Bond film, being more suited to Are You Being Served. As for Jimmy Dean's Willard Whyte, I found him to be one of the most irritating characters in any Bond film, though thankfully he does not get much screen time.There are some good points in the film, including an effective fight between Bond and Peter Franks in Amsterdam, and a memorable scene in which OO7 has to grapple with two striking young women called Bambi and Thumper. In general, however, DAF feels tired, trying to compensate for the lack of a decent script with its childish humour and endless stunts. It is all a long way away from the classic Connery Bonds of the early 60s, and indeed DAF is much closer in tone to the jokey Roger Moore films that would follow it during the rest of the 70s, although most of those have more going for them than this film. All in all, DAF is more of a feeble exercise in camp comedy than a stylish spy thriller, a sad way for Connery to leave the part that had made him a star. Of all the Bond films, probably only Moonraker is worse.",Diamonds Are Forever
235,Bel Ludovic,Oh dear. It's the Seventies.,4,2 December 2002,"This is undoubtedly the Bond film I enjoy least. Although the film boasts some cracking lines, Connery is simply going through the motions and picking up a paycheck at the end. Four years after his last one and his age is showing, too. (Spoilers ahead.) The whole screenplay is completely uninvolving, and no explanation is given for why Blofeld suddenly has hair and is not in a wheelchair. The film's kitch, camp quality can be put down to the prevailing flavour of the era, the beginning of the Seventies, and to its credit there's some wonderfully periodic interior design to be witnessed, but a Las Vegas setting cheapens just about any film, including this one. When I was younger I found Mr Wint and Mr Kidd rather creepy, I think due to the appalling hairstyle and moustache on Mr Kidd. Their portrayal is more than a little homophobic, too; I don't know any gays who go around in public spraying themselves extravagantly with perfume like Mr Wint did, and the way he seemed to enjoy having his arms rammed up his groin before being chucked into the sea by Bond speaks volumes of the prejudices of the time. Better by far are Bambi and Thumper and the scene with them in it is probably my favourite, together with the wonderful fight scene with the real Mr Franks in the Amsterdam lift. Otherwise, Diamonds Are Forever is a dated, grainy, messy stinker of a film, and by the time the climax on the oil rig takes place the film has lost me, as I sit with glazed-eyes in front of the screen deciding what to have for dinner.",Diamonds Are Forever
236,chriswright1969,A fun non-political correct ride and time capsule.,7,11 March 2018,"The 7th official James Bond film Diamonds Are Forever does not have the reputation of being one of the better Bond epics. But I must admit for having a soft spot for Diamonds Are Forever despite the fact that in hindsight the film has missed some great opportunities.It was decided to ignore the events of the previous Bond film On Her Majesty's Secret Service (1969) which ended with the murder of the wife of James Bond by his nemesis Ernst Stavro Blofeld. It could have been a great revenge movie, but it's not.Diamonds Are Forever starts with a very short fight scene in a Japanese decor, telling us that it's starting where the 5th Bondfilm You Only Live Twice (1967) left off. At the time On Her Majesty's Secret Service was considered a failure (it wasn't) and the rumor was that the new James Bond actor George Lazenby got fired (he wasn't, he decided not to go on, much to his regret later). Ever since then, the reputation of On Her Majesty's Secret Service has surpassed Diamonds Are Forever.But on the plus side Diamonds Are Forever is one of most efficient Bond films made. The tone is (a little too) lightweight, it has that smoothly early seventies style and shows what Las Vegas looked like in 1970/1971. The greatest asset of course is that Sean Connery returned to the franchise after being absent in the previous film. Older and a little too out of shape, Connery is at his most relaxed in this one and even here he is still the best cinematic interpretation of the character. A James Bond who has seen and done it all. The only time Bond is really surprised in this film is when he meets Blofeld again, whom he thought he had killed in the prologue. Diamonds Are Forever may have discarded the revenge plot but It was a financial successful revenge for Sean Connery on the Bond producers. Connery always felt short changed by the producers but was lured back by United Artists for one more film for an enormous salary (which he donated) and benefits (including a two movie deal).Diamonds Are Forever is also a guilty pleasure nowadays because Bond gets to do things which today's cinematic heroes can no longer get away with: he hits women, kicks Blofeld's cat and disposes easily of two stereotypical gay men (including finishing it off with a one liner). So, unless you're easily offended, Diamonds Are Forever can also be recommended as a terrific time capsule.",Diamonds Are Forever
237,SpotMonkee,Mediocre Finale to the Sean Connery Era,6,25 November 2015,"Sean Connery should have quit while he was on top. After You Only Live Twice, he should have stuck to his guns and not returned to the role, let other actors handle. But alas, here we are. What should have been a dark revenge tale of Bond seeking vengeance on the man who killed his wife becomes a campy, painfully average romp through a single casino and car chases that are more at home in an episode of The Dukes of Hazzard. The plot follows Bond (played for the last time in the official series by Sean Connery) killing and impersonating a diamond smuggler (Joe Armstrong) in order to track the flow of stolen diamonds alongside a fellow smuggler (Jill St. John) who remains unaware of his true identity. The flow leads him from Amsterdam to the Whyte House casino in Las Vegas, home to an eccentric billionaire (Jimmy Dean, the sausage guy) who hasn't left his penthouse in years (gee, I wonder if this is in anyway a reference to Howard Hughes, oh well, probably not) and eventually, his old nemesis (Charles Gray).

He's looking veryold for Bond, which is somewhat ironic, considering thatRoger Moore, who replaced him the next outing, is threeyears older than Connery yet looks younger in his earlyoutings. And aside from this... this movie is just silly and campy. Practically a comedy.  It isn't unwatchable, but it is moreakin to Austin Powers than Connery's Bond, who once wasa dark, brutal agent under orders.

Unfortunately, Jill St John plays a rather flat Bond girl after Diana Rigg's superb performance in the previous movie, and the special effects look terribly outdated today. Highlights include John Barry's excellent score, the pre- credits sequence, Bond mountaineering up a Las Vegas casino, Blofeld's henchmen Wint and Kidd, and the Moonbuggy chase.

Connery looks very unsuited as Bond. He has gained weight and looks old and tired.The humor is way over the top, the storyline too stupid and complicated and the larger than life characters can't be taken seriously at all. Especially Blofeld, who turns into a drag queen.It seems Connery has more fun playing Bond than in his last one, but fun can't disguise how weak this film actually is.I wonder if Lazenby could have made this one better...",Diamonds Are Forever
241,jim_skreech,The 'interim' Bond,5,11 January 2016,"Following the previous On Her Majesty's Secret Service, the Bond series was in a state of flux, having lost both it's key star, and it's new successor. George Lazenby famously turned his back on the Bond franchise, looking at the brave new counter culture films like Easy Rider as the way forward, and Bond as a rapidly moulding relic of the 60s. We know now that Bond has continued to pack out cinemas on each release, but following Lazenby's departure, the question was a troubled 'what now?'.Bond traditionalists are still crying out 'bring back Connery!'. And for DAF, they did. Connery was tempted back with a record-breaking 1.25 million, which he did donate in full to the Scottish International Education Trust, but this is rather the only positive that can be said about this involvement here. Connery was tired with the Bond franchise, and it's clear from his performance that he did not have his heart in the film, and gives a rather cynical performance. He had also visibly aged and put on weight. Ironically, he looked far fresher in his return in Never Say Never Again some 12 years later.Just like the decade itself, DAF is much more violent than it's predecessors, with some pretty grisly deaths (immolation, drowning, and a scorpion dropped down the back of the neck), however, the brutal fight in the elevator with Peter Franks is superbly choreographed, and in an era where Bond appeared to stroll through his fights with ease, this scene showed Bond meeting a true equal, fighting with a real sense of grit and intensity not seen elsewhere.One of the real weak points of DAF are the locations. Whilst other films in the series were set in places that the audience dreamed of going to (or sometimes didn't dare to go to), 1970s Las Vegas looks naff and lacks any kind of glitz, giving the film rather a cheap wood-panelled 'made for TV' veneer. However, what I really found unforgivable about DAF was it's continuity following OHMSS, something that has given some Bond fans cause to rather consider DAF to be a sequel to You Only Live Twice, and OHMSS to follow on from DAF. Following the murder of his wife, Theresa, on his wedding night, Bond should be explosive with anguish and rage. Although the opening scene shows Bond roughing up a few suspects, he seems to regard Blofeld, now a camp caricature better suited to a 1970s sitcom, little more than an old rogue, seemingly no more angry with him for murdering his wife, than he would be for keying his car. This was such an opportunity missed, and leaves me wondering how it would have been if Lazenby stayed and DAF intentionally scripted as a direct follow- up.DAF for me is the 'interim Bond, lost between the optimistic pop- Bond of the 60s, and the escapist romps of the later 70s. Fortunately the follow up, Live And Let Die, tapped into a new fun, playful Bond, and gave the franchise a lifeline, one that was later cemented with The Spy Who Loved Me. Connery on the other hand was finally allowed to act his age, and followed up DAF with 1973's The Offence, in my opinion the most intense and outstanding performance of his career.",Diamonds Are Forever
242,thomas-williamson-ga,Sean Connery returns and goes back out with a bang,8,26 February 2011,"After the release of On Her Majesty's Secret Service, most people probably assumed that George Lazenby was officially the new James Bond... they were wrong. Connery returned supposedly one last time to reprise Bond in 'Diamonds Are Forever' which completed the Ernest Blofeld trilogy of the series for those who know what I'm talking about. The film picks up loosely following the events of OHMSS. What are those events one might ask? Watch it and see for yourself. Overall, I really liked Diamonds are Forever. It is on of the first Bond films I saw as a teenager so I guess it holds somewhat of a special place for me. That being said, I may fail to point out possible legit criticisms so for anyone who wonders what those criticisms could be, watch the movie or look for another review. Regardless of what ""could"" be wrong with Diamonds Are Forever, it definitely holds up well and is very entertaining. The movie on one or two occasions tends to make fun of itself but that really takes nothing away from it. As with the previous installments before and after Thunderball, I recommend this Bond title.",Diamonds Are Forever

Instead, we get a mindless, shrill, completely unreal parody of Ian Fleming's brilliant master spy.Sean Connery returns after a sabbatical, older, tubbier and less interested in his legendary role than ever. He is joined by a plethora of over-acting actors playing moronic characters: chief amongst them are Jill St John, who easily wins the medal of most annoying Bond girl of all time; Jimmy Dean, who's boneheaded Texan drawl adds more than a few eye-rolls to the movie.The film is also burdened with one of the most convoluted plots of all Bond films, which is very odd considering how cartoonish the whole setup is. Some good special effects just cannot compensate for all the inane hijacks that accompany them.I have to say this right now, and that is I love James Bond and everything about him, but this film is so embarrassingly bad, I don;t even consider it Bond canon.

The only foreign scenery Bond visits is the Netherlands, but he quickly ends up bogging down in Las Vegas and environs for nearly the entire film. Early 1970's Vegas looks dreary rather than glitzy, and the Nevada desert is not exactly a glamor spot either.Jill St. John certainly has the bod for a Bond girl, but she somehow misses to have any charm or mystery about her. She seems way too ordinary most of the time.Worst of all, Sean Connery looks as if he is going through the motions in this one. He rarely looks as dangerous or menacing as he did in his early films, and generally comes across as an action figure without much personality or charm.The Wint and Kidd henchmen duo seem especially goofy, and just plain weird rather than fascinating.On the good side, the Willard Whyte parody of Howard Hughes is clever, and the Bambi and Thumper scene works quite well.This is worth seeing if you simply must see all the Bond films, but it is probably not one that you would pick from all the rest.",Diamonds Are Forever

The film manages to be both witty and boring. The screenplay provides many great oneliners but the action sequences are dull. There's quite a few dumb scenes, which I blame on director Guy Hamilton, who introduced the silliness into the Bond films in the otherwise classic Goldfinger. Things would only get worse from here. The film also contains the worst version of Blofeld and the Bond Girl, Tiffany Chase, is somewhat annoying. Felix Leiter is given more to do in this film and Norman Burton is good in the role.

253,kylezeb,Worst Bond Film Yet,4,20 January 2002,"DIAMONDS ARE FOREVERWithout a doubt in my mind this is by far and above the worst James Bond Film yet made.  Nearly every aspect of the film is uniformly bad.  Coming off the superb On Her Majesty's Secret Service, which is in my mind the best Bond film yet, Diamonds Are Forever is an immense disapointment.Story-wise the film is perhaps the worst part.  After Bond's wife Tracy died in the previous movie, we should've had a revenge-minded Bond going after Blofeld in a tense, realistic espionage story.  Instead we get a light-hearted, humor-filled a story in which Tracy is not mentioned once. While there is some trace of revenge in the pre-credit sequence with Bond going after Blofeld, it appears to me he is merely going after Blofed because it is his job not because of his memory for Tracy.  Instead of realism, we get a campy film with absolutely no trace of tension or adventure.  Nearly every part of the film is unbelieveable, and the charcters are 1-dimenionsal at best.  The ending is completely uninvolving and the usual huge set is cheap looking.  The worst travesty of the ending though, is the fact that Bond doesn't even take revenge on Blofeld!
While many people said bringing Sean Connery back is an automatic plus, I strongly dissagree.  Now don't get me wrong I am a big Connery fan and in the early Bond films he was really quite good, but his performance in the film is a complete bore. Obviously he was unexcited about doing another Bond film and was doing it only for the huge amounts of money the producers paid him. After seeing this perfomance I was even missing George Lazenby, even though he isnh't as good an actor as Connery at least he was energetic in his portrayal as Bond.Other actors in the film are poor to say the best.  Jill St. John as the companion is satisfactory at the beginning of the film as the strength and resolve of her charcter are definate strong points.  However, by the end of the film she turns into a complete idiot whom Bond constantly puts down. Charles Gray as Blofeld is perhaps the worst Bond villian yet. Non-threating to Bond, he is simply there to make suposedly funny comments. Even the MI6 regulars, usually unflapple in their diginity, manage to embarass themselves in this mess.Most Bond fans say that The Man With the Golden Gun or A View To a Kill are the worst Bond films, but at least those films are enjoyable.  Diamonds Are Forever is a complete mess and if you want to see a good Bond Film rent For Your Eyes Only or On Her Majesty's Secret Service Avoid this piece of junk at all costs!",Diamonds Are Forever
254,megunticook,"Not good, even for Connery",3,17 August 2005,"No Bond film is completely worthless (Moonraker is worth the trip for the yucks alone, but it helps to be high when you watch it), but many are not worth their source material and this is one of them. It's unfortunate that the producers felt they had to constantly outdo themselves with each successive movie, straying further and further from their source. The book ""Diamonds are Forever"" is a taught, gritty thriller that would have made a swell noir in its day. The films always struggled with fidelity when it came to adaptation. Only ""Goldfinger"" and, largely, ""On Her Majesty's Secret Service"" were faithful to (and, in the case of ""Goldfinger"", actually improved upon) their source. ""Dr. No"" and ""From Russia With Love"" suffered by their inclusion of SPECTRE. ""Thunderball"" needlessly complicated its plot. And ""You Only Live Twice"" began the unfortunate trend of picking only basic elements from the source and throwing them into a whole new fabrication. ""Diamonds are Forever"" suffers this fate, and not to its benefit. It starts with a diamond smuggling pipeline and brings Bond to America to face a cadre of colorful thugs, as the novel did, but departs wildly by replacing the mob with SPECTRE as the chief villain. From there it follows the standard formula the Bonds have more or less continued since. But it suffers for more reasons than that. The script lacks wit, the performances lack conviction, the stunts are dry, the picture is flat. And everybody seems to be sweating. Connery is heavier and relaxed, but he's completely charmless. Charles Gray is simply wrong for Blofeld (they've never really gotten this character right on screen). I suppose Jill St. John is okay as Tiffany Case. She could have been a little tougher. She started out right, but descended into hapless damsel. Wint and Kidd, ruthless killers in the novel, are played for laughs. Even John Barry's score feels listless. It even regurgitates some cues from ""From Russia with Love"" (which would later reappear in ""Moonraker""). Perhaps he was becoming as bored with the franchise as Connery had. The series would continue to bloat throughout the seventies before tightening up again in the eighties.If you're a completist it's worth watching, but probably not worth having on your shelf. Of course, when there's nothing else on TV a Bond film always fills the hole.",Diamonds Are Forever

Once there, he gets in the usual sort of trouble with all sort of baddies.By then in his early 40s, Connery looks (from my view) aged. Though his return as Bond, after Lazenby quitted, was the obvious choice (however much money he was paid), I think they should have picked someone else. He manages, but... I don't know... he has the charm to play Bond, but he is by now not physically, I'm inclined to say The film is fine up to a certain degree.

260,bobsie-1,My Least Favourite,7,26 July 2010,"So Diamonds are forever was fair but i didn't feel the Bond. 1. The Bond Girls. First off they were so annoying. they made me laugh because they were so stupid. Plenty O'Toole could get away with not being so bad because she is barely in the story. Tiffany made me mad. Seriously she fell off the oil rig with a machine gun by shooting it, the was pretty funny but stupid. Bond girls total rating: 4/10. 2. Villain. Still the Ernst Stavro Blofeld I know. Just not evil and sinister in my opinion. Henchmen some were OK while others weren't that good. Bambi and Thumper, Funny, dumb names, but good fight.Mr Wint and Dr Kidd. Not so great. Total 7/10 3.James Bond himself. Sean Connery so obviously good. I have not much to say. He wasn't as good as others in this. So the total:7/10 That was my review, bye.",Diamonds Are Forever
261,earbyc,Inane,5,12 October 2009,"I watched this yesterday, ITV are running some Bonds right now and I had ""enjoyed"" those shown like Thunderball & You Only Live Twice, strange though in this one Charles Gray was Henderson, on the screen for about 10 seconds before getting a knife in him. Now he turns up in this as Blofeld or is it Blofield, who cares.The whole thing was a shambolic effort just to prove Bond films had run out of gas way back then.This should have been the last one.Not enough lines again, how many lines does one need to say the film was a waste of time and money, shall I write more lines, and keep writing lines, why do you need ten lines, is this ten lines now?",Diamonds Are Forever
262,bumologist,You never know what the future will bring.,8,26 November 2016,"I thought this one was a lot of fun when I saw it when I was 15 years old, and it still amuses me. Of all the Connery Bond movies, Never Say Never is the worst, and Thunderball is close behind. Is it great? No. But it's not bad, and IMHO, is a lot better than some of the later ones with Roger Moore who was too old at the end of his run. I thought Mr Kidd and Mr. Wint were very amusing, Bruce Glover resembled a neighbor of mine at the time, which would have mortified the neighbor, a nutty guy that tried to stab my dog with a pitchfork once. Jimmy Dean was fine, as was most of the cast. I never had a clue I would move to Las Vegas 1n '75, and in 1979 start working in a Hotel (Nevada Hotel, 235 S. Main, closed now, and it appears to have been bought by the Golden Nugget for some future project) built where the car chase was filmed! And then a year or so later, I was driving on the opposite side of town from where I lived and saw the ""Slumber Inc"" building! I thought it was just a building with a fake front on it in the movie, but it was the real thing, a funeral home, with a different name, of course. I can't remember if it was ""Bunker Brothers"" or something else now, But I went inside and it appeared the inside of the building was used for at least some of the scenes that took place in it.",Diamonds Are Forever
263,big_man_andy,An average Bond,9,26 May 2005,WHAT Happened!!!!! Connery returning should have been the greatest thing in all of Bond but instead it was a very Roger Moore style movie. This is one of the poorest Bond films due to all the comedy and the lack actually being British secret agent. Great title song!!! Jill St.John was awful possibly the worst Bond girl. This film was camped up to high heaven with its very colourful American environments an not forgetting ms Case's hair. Mr Wint and Mr Kidd are the only reason this film doesn't deserve a 3/10 they salvage whats left of a sunken ship. Great lines and very ruthless for a pair of puffs. A very big let down after a good film OHMSS.,Diamonds Are Forever

I watched it and other Bond film again because I could see them in HD. I'm sort of amazed at how weak and lazy this film was, just a fraction of the creativity of the first four Bond films (Dr. No, Goldfinger, From Russia With Love and Thunderball). When I say ""fraction,"" I mean about a tenth as good. In those earlier films, you could have some success jumping into fantasy land and imagining being part of the action and suspense, so to speak. In this film, you'd fall asleep even trying! Connery had gain so much weight and looked so old that he is unbelievable as a carrier of ""00"" designation.All I can say is, gee, I wish I could have make as much money in my life as Connery did here and give almost nothing to customer to earn it.Finally, I liked seeing Jill St. John in high def, actually my main reason to watch this. She is extremely attractive here. She's about 68 years now. I wonder if she is still a ""10"" for that age category.",Diamonds Are Forever

267,david_espesset,Surrealism in the James Bond movies.,8,4 December 2018,"The James Bond movies have always displayed surrealistic aspects: Dr. No, Goldfinger, You Only Live Twice, The Man With The Golden Gun, The Spy Who Loved Me, Moonraker and Die Another Day are certainly the most surrealistic Bond films.However, I consider Diamonds Are Forever to beat them all. It is definitely not the best James Bond movie, but, to me, it appears as the most surrealistic one. Each and every situation, each and every scene contains numerous surrealistic elements. Many instances:
Blofeld creating look-alikes of himself;The killing of the doctor by droping a scorpion into his shirt;""If God had wanted man to fly, he would have given him wings.""Mr Wint & Mr Kidd as ruthless killers;The digger with all his teeth replaced by diamonds;The way Tiffany Case receives Bond in her Amsterdam flat;""Well, as long as the collar and cuffs match.""Bond pretending he just killed... James Bond;""Alimentary, Doctor Leiter"";""I got a brudder""; ""Small world"";Having to cremate a dead body to retreive the diamonds;Attempting to kill Bond by putting him in a coffin to be cremated;Plenty O'Toole;""You handle those cubes like a monkey handles coconuts!""""Well, I'm afraid you've caught me with more than my hands up.""Throwing Plenty out of the window in an attempt to kill her;""I didn't know there was a pool down there!"";The scenes at the Circus Circus Las Vegas casino;Bond waiting for Tiffany in her house;Plenty dead in the swimming pool;Whyte's laboratory outside Las Vegas, complete with astronauts and the moon buggy;Bond posing as a scientist to investigate the lab;Bond's escape riding the moon buggy;The water bed in Bond and Tiffany's suite;Bond stepping on the top of the lift to get to the roof of The Whyte House;Bond meeting two identical Blofelds at the same time;""Good idea, Mr Bond!""; ""But wrong pussy..."";Bond buried underground in a pipeline in order to kill him;The rat scene, especially: ""Well, one of us smells like a tart's handkerchief. I'm afraid it's me. Sorry, old boy.""""I was just out walking my rat and seem to have lost my way.""Bambi and Thumper as bodyguards;Blofeld escaping The Whyte House disguised as a woman;The entire plot revolving around making a satellite by using large amounts of diamonds, and the way it is subsequently used;Bond's arrival at the oil rig (most surrealistic moment of the entire film?);Tiffany taking a sunbath on the oil rig;Blofeld's attempt to escape in his mini-sub;The cake bomb;Bond recognizing the scent of Mr Wint's aftershave;The way Bond gets rid of Mr Wint;And finally : ""How the hell do we get those diamonds down again?""And there are many others!Perhaps the next time you will watch Diamonds you will enjoy it all the more!",Diamonds Are Forever
268,Chelios24,Sleepy....yet good.,6,12 February 2007,"This movie is....odd, to say the least. After taking a break from Bond for a movie, Connery returns. But from the very beginning, this movie is a little....off. In the opening teaser, Bond has some really terrible lines, and the first impression of Connery's return is ""Man! He's looking old!"" The plot is a little scatterbrained. Unless I missed something, there are a few points where you are just left wondering things like how Bond knows where to go. The evil plan isn't really as....coherently outlined as in other Bond movies. The director, Hamilton, claims this was meant to be the funniest of the Bond movies, and while some humor is good, and Mr. Wint and Mr. Kidd are good, entertaining villains, some points are just...surreal. Is that a good word for it? The movie isn't boring, but it's very....sleepy. The music is played down, overly simplistic (a disappointing and ill-fitting score), and the characters all walk around very slowly, and speak slowly, and the whole experience is just sleepy.But, naturally, it's an extremely entertaining movie, as all the Bond films are (with the exception of Die Another Day), so understand that for these criticisms, it's still a valued entry in my DVD collection.",Diamonds Are Forever
269,LaGatta,At the risk of sounding like the snobby goats munching celluloid from the studio dumpster....,2,25 June 1999,"Comparing Fleming's books to the ""Bond movies"" is always a bit like comparing apples and oranges.  Going in with this understanding, only an imbecile tries to draw too direct a comparison, and thus the films are generally enjoyable.  In this case, however, I have to say the book is SO MUCH BETTER that the movie should be viewed only in a study in how NOT to make movies.  The book was enjoyable, the movie so over-the-top silly it nearly parodies itself (e.g. bikini-clad Tiffany and the automatic rifle). The plot blasts off into that Cold-War-comic-book techno""terror"" stratosphere that dances on the brink of incredibly bad science fiction -- i.e. laser death rays and world domination. The worst trouble with this turkey is that it doesn't seem to know it should take itself lightly.  The Roger Moore era had its share of plots cooked up according to the same cheesier-than-macaroni recipe, but there was an overall ambience of escapist fun, and frankly Roger Moore's looks as well as his on-screen manner better suited that sort of light-hearted womanizing superman-gone-inspector-gadget Bond had already been made into in Diamonds Are Forever.  Connery, who could have been light-hearted and funny, was unfortunately directed to be the old ""Connery-style Bond"" and try to play this ludicrous mess seriously -- a grave mistake.None of Fleming's books got so silly, though taken as a complete series would stretch realism (Bond kept ticking through more lickings than a news-anchor pitchman's wristwatch.)  In this case, though, the novel has a particular authenticity even in the diamond smuggling and the rigged casinos, perhaps in part because of Fleming's real-world study of ""The Diamond Smugglers"" (not an exciting book, but a worthwhile read) and in large part because it had elements of the mundane and of the true human misbehavior that would not fit the feel-good commercial action/adventure genre.  (In the book,Tiffany has good reason to be a case -- and is a much more interesting one -- and is much less of a puff-ball bouncing about in a bikini for no better reason than the cheap titillation of the male audience.)If you want a good evening's entertainment, pick up the book and leave this turkey on the shelf.",Diamonds Are Forever
270,stuartbillinge,"""It's a lot smoother ride in the back.""",10,9 June 2020,"A quick review. This is a very easy bond to like. It oozes charm, camp and cheeky in all the right places and never pretends to be something it isn't. Featuring the guy from ""Rocky Horror Show,"" really sums it up. The classic Bond villain, Blofield, two gay henchmen, extensive shows of Las Vegas, Amsterdam and even South Africa. The makers took Flemings book and had some real fun with it. John Barry's score is brilliant throughout and Shirley Bassey sings the timeless main theme of the same name. It encourages the viewer to see the lighter side, but still contains really some dark set pieces too. I've seen the costume worn by the almost unbelievable named ""Plenty O'toole"" it's minute, evening gown an anorexic would find snug. Lots of glamour, the film has a Triumph Stag in mustard yellow (so 70's""). You get to see the amazing Hovercraft from Dover, that was a real treat to go over to France on. The one liners are witty by Connery, supported strongly by the female lead. It feature homosexuality, the first time I've ever seen that in a bond. The promo art is top notch, Adams is on the sets and Connery give Roger Moore the best spot to launch his success as Bond. It's in my top 3 because it's clever, funny, dark and exciting. Getting a scorpion down the back as a death is exactly the sort of creativity that makes Bonds great. Enjoy, and enjoy again.",Diamonds Are Forever

273,will-boyd,Funny and entertaining.,8,26 August 2010,"This was the Bond film that introduced irony and real wit to the series, thanks to the recently deceased Tom Mankeiwicz. Connery bluffly handled the role, and never telegraphed the jokes. He had aged since his appearance in You Only Live Twice, but his no-nonsense confidence worked very well with a terrific, fast-moving story that constantly surprised and entertained. Critics, notably Pauline Kael, enjoyed the witty, sardonic script that deftly referenced the modern takes on subjects like the Funeral business and Howard Hughes's disconcerting reclusiveness. Like the best Bond movies, it took you on a tour of an exotic location, and Mankiewicz' Las Vegas was one of the best uses of a location in the Bond oeuvre. Mankiewicz kept the movie moving, while inserting memorable and funny bits of business along the way. Morton Slumber, Shady Tree, Plenty O'Toole, among others, are perfectly realized minor characters, and cast perfectly. Not to mention Jimmy Dean as Willard Whyte, who brings cornball gusto to the role. This film was a balance of humor and credibility that the series never again equaled, and after this the irony quickly curdled. Diamonds Are Forever is a great example of creative storytelling, and maybe the most fun of the Bond films.",Diamonds Are Forever

This Blofeld was not like the others. He wasn't ruthless, evil or creepy like the others. And wasn't didn't this actor play another character in You Only Live Twice?

Tiffany Case is an unforgettable charismatic beauty with girl power. Mr. Kidd and Mr. Wint are dangerous motherf-ckers but a great laugh too with lots of in-film gay jokes. Plenty O'Toole had a fantastic name and figure and the way she is thrown out of the hotel window by those dumb goons was pure dark humour. Blofeld has his cats and twin brother.

281,rayray-rh,Terrible Finale for Connery,3,8 December 2015,"Firstly, I would like to start by saying that this is my first review. I've never been compelled before, but thought I'd register my disgust with this Bond title.I am a huge Bond fan. Grew up watching them and always find time to re-watch, especially when the latest flick hits the theatres. When I judge a Bond film, there are certain criteria I use to assess. Vehicles, gadgets, villains, girls, comedy, locations, plot, Bond himself and the direction to name a few.Diamonds Are Forever fails on almost everyone of these. The lack of vehicles and gadgets gets to me, but the casting for Blofeld was terrible. For starters, he's not bald, he's not menacing and he's just weak all round. When Sean Connery quit the role after You Only Live Twice, who would have thought we would have seen him back? I, personally liked George Lazenby's performance as Bond and enjoyed OHMSS. But this film was just one too many for Connery, and for me, ruined his legacy somewhat. It only cost the producers a whopping $1.25m for his services. He failed to live up to expectations.Guy Hamilton took the directors chair following; possibly the best Bond film ever in Goldfinger, his work here was awful. The fight scenes looked lazy and the acting was bad. How can Bond, looking for revenge for his wife's murder be so civil with Blofeld following OHMSS? The film started like a revenge mission but then things got friendly.The henchmen Mr Kidd & Mr Wint are by far the worse villains ever on a Bond film and again, the acting is appalling.The plot isn't even interesting. How many more times can Blofeld hold the world ransom? This time, he's doing it with the aid of a diamond-encrusted laser satellite. Considering this is the last time we see Blofeld, there was no explanation or closure to this character. We even get to see the super-villain and mysterious SPECTRE leader in drag. (Shocking) The whole film skimps on action.There are a few saving graces to this film. The locations of Amsterdam and Las Vegas gets the thumb up. The performance of Jimmy Dean as reclusive billionaire Willard Whyte was surprisingly a good casting job. (The only one) The pre-credit scene was good and should have continued in this vein. I score this movie 3 out of 10. It's the worse Bond film by far. Connery should have never come back. Maybe on my next re-watch, I'll skip straight to the Roger Moore legacy.",Diamonds Are Forever
282,war_eagle27,One of the best bond films,7,17 December 2007,"This comment contains possible spoiler. This if one of my favorite bond movies. First off it has the best bond, Connery. Second, Jill St. John is the sexiest bond girl in any of the films. The reason for this is that she is not only beautiful but, unlike many of the early bond girls she is smart, funny and an equal to James. This was not done again till much later in the series. The plot is not the greatest of the bond movies nor is the worst. The only other bond movie I liked better is Goldfinger. The movie centers around stolen diamonds and Las Vegas. If u are familiar with Las Vegas u will probably recognize the sequence in Circus Circus. This movie also has one of the best title songs. If u enjoyed this one, Moonraker is a similar movie. 7/10",Diamonds Are Forever

My immediate reaction was that it is abundantly clear that everyone involved with making it just did not care anymore (which carried over into several Roger Moore era films).But as I found out later, it's a sloppy mess from start to finish due to the budget not being large enough to meet what the plot required. Consequently, the special effects and stunts suffered and any of the plausibility required to enjoy a 007 film was compromised. The lack in attention to detail throughout is DAF's downfall.This is one movie that actually deserves to be remade with a proper budget.",Diamonds Are Forever

Noticed the scene where Bond takes the Mustang down the alley, and tilts it up on two wheels; when the car starts back down on 4 wheels, it is on the wrong side. Maybe I missed something, or an intervening scene was cut. By the way, which hotel was cast as ""The Whyte House"" in Vegas? Also, is it true that the two goofy thugs who worked for Blofeld and followed Bond around, were supposed to be gay? If so, what did that add to the story? Was it just something I missed, or were there obvious indications to this? Also, the dumb-acting female (""...you stupid twit..."") really detracted from the experience for me.",Diamonds Are Forever
