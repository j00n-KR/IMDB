0,claudio_carvalho,Deceptive Sophisticated Porn,4,27 August 2006,"The structure of my reviews in IMDb usually begins with a summary of the plot in the first paragraph and my personal opinion in the next one. However, how to summarize ""9 Songs"" using more than the storyline? A man and a woman meet each other in a rock concert, and along the days they have sex, use drugs and go to rock and roll concerts. Michael Winterbottom, the director of the sensitive ""Jude""; the powerful ""Welcome to Sarajevo""; the original ""I Want You""; the dramatic ""Wonderland""; the intelligent ""Code 46"", among others good movies, seems to have decided to shoot porn. Using and abusing of the unknown actress Margo Stilley, who practices fellatio, masturbation, bondage and explicit sex in front of the camera, the story makes an analogy with the solitude of the Antarctica to give an intellectual appearance to the shallow, pointless and silly screenplay. I expected much more from such a great director, who should know that what happens inside four walls of a bedroom belongs to the lovers. My vote is four.Title (Brazil): ""9 Canções"" (""9 Songs"")",9 Songs
1,rmax304823,There have been worse.,6,6 January 2006,"I have to say that I dozed off a bit during the 9 songs recorded live at a concert because, with one exception, a simple piano solo, it is just not my kind of music anymore. I don't mean that the music is poor, only that I can't tell whether it's any good or not.About half the movie is shot at a concert. The other half sketches in a brief relationship between a Londoner and a visiting American student. The episodes involving the couple are little slices of life with many fades to black, many cuts that seem arbitrary, and some visual and narrative allusions to Antarctica, the significance of which escapes me. Unless, and I hate to suggest this, the significance is unthinkably banal: humans are emotionally frigid and driven by natural forces, like icebergs.The Londoner (O'Brian) seems like a nice-enough ordinary guy. The young woman (Stilly) is drawn from the ranks of models and has features that are plainly attractive, on the cusp of really attractive, and her figure is flawless.You can't get past mentioning her figure because the viewer gets to see so much of it. That may not be unusual these days, but seeing erections, explicit oral sex, emissions, and actual intercourse in a mainstream movie is a rarity. There simply isn't that much male nudity around. That's okay with me. I don't care one way or the other, but this goes far beyond a glimpse of O'Brian's schlong and reaches a point at which we can tell that O'Brian is definitely not Jewish.The couple don't do much in their episodes except make love and talk about it in street language. (There is some exchange involving her taking pills too early in the morning but it does not amount to an argument.) Sex isn't so much explored as it is displayed. She puts off committee meetings so they can get it on. He performs cunnilingus, seeming to plunge into her from above, like a diver in search of abalone. He blindfolds her and ties her willing hands to the bed while he goes down on her. She ties HIM to the bed and steps on his chest with high-heeled boots.Stilly may be acting. You can never tell with women! But O'Brian, although he obviously must know he's on camera, must have studied with Stanislavski. The two of them together constitute a sexual dynamo. When Stilly is not on or under O'Brian she is using a little buzzing toy. O'Brian seems to have a nervous system whose neurons lack any refractory period. She may be voracious but he is a medical miracle.Although nothing much happens, I didn't find the movie either particularly dull or at all pornographic. The romantic interludes were erotic but might have been more so if we'd known more about the two people we're spying on. Okay. She's a student. But what is she studying? And where? And what drew her to her subject? He seems to work in a geological research lab, but does he like his work? Does he have a family? How do they feel about leaving each other? Anyone's guess is as good as anyone else's, and that's a kind of weakness because if you want to do nothing more than watch two strangers copulate for money you can get that in any skin flick. And ultimately, in every way, this movie is an improvement over that.",9 Songs
2,BA_Harrison,Sex and Drugs and Rock 'n' Roll.,6,18 December 2014,"In 'the most sexually explicit film in the history of British cinema', as the hype reads, Lisa (Margo Stilley) and Matt (Kieran O'Brien) spend their free time snorting coke, looking rather bored at rock gigs, and boning each other.Needless to say, there are plenty of moments of graphic nookie between stars Stilley (a little too young and inexperienced to be taking on such a daring film role, maybe) and O'Brien (who, judging by his DVD commentary, seems to have had a whale of a time), lots of rough and ready music footage shot at various London gigs, and some pretentious bilge about life in the Antarctic, all accompanied by a monotonous voice-over.Is 9 Songs a bona fide work of art, voyeuristic porn masquerading as art, a realistic study of an intimate relationship, an exploitative piece of trash, or a risqué promo for up and coming rock bands? I have no idea: it really is very hard to fathom out what Winterbottom and Co.'s intentions were for making this film, although I'm guessing the real answer is, 'it's whatever you want it to be'.Viewers will watch 9 Songs for their own personal reasons (to become aroused; for intellectual discussion at dinner parties; as ammunition for attacking liberal types; or just to see what the fuss is about) and enjoy it accordingly. I thought it passed 66 minutes quite painlessly—the action was hot and the music was cool—but for me, perhaps the most interesting thing about 9 Songs is seeing how the film will affect the stars' careers in the long term, and guessing where this whole 'real sex in cinema' trend will end (Brad and Angelina going at it on Screen 1 at the local multiplex?!?!).",9 Songs
3,Bunuel1976,"9 SONGS (Michael Winterbottom, 2004) BOMB",1,21 August 2006,"So the British can make an art-house porn flick just as much as the French, the Scandinavians and the Japanese - big deal! This film is living proof of the inertia which afflicts today's cinema, when pretentious trash like this draws so much attention to itself - merely for daring to be sexually explicit!; besides, being shot on digital, it looks like crap and also features poor sound recording (which isn't helped by impenetrable British accents)! There's no plot to speak of, just the young couple (the girl is appealing enough, but the boy is a listless bore) alternating between attending rock concerts (performed by a plethora of anonymous modern bands) - hence the title - and engaging in intimate relations bordering on sado-masochism! Actually, a third thread/setting comes into play on occasion - presumably taking place after their separation - with the boy doing research work in the Antarctic (with pompous narration to match), but the point behind this - or any of it, for that matter - is impossible to fathom... Indeed, why anyone should want to see it (apart for reasons of titillation or merely as a curiosity) - let alone invest in it - is even more bewildering!",9 Songs
4,grantss,The shock value degrades this movie,6,26 September 2014,"A movie that history will remember for only one thing: the explicit sex scenes. However, look beyond that and you have a semi-decent story of the history of a relationship, from start to finish. Moreover, you have some superb live music. Acts shown include Elbow, The Dandy Warhols, Black Rebel Motorcycle Club, Franz Ferdinand and Primal Scream.Ultimately, I think Michael Winterbottom made this movie, and included the scenes he did, just for shock value. If he had cut down on the sex scenes, and looked more at the lead characters' relationship - its reasons for existence, its highs and lows, etc - he would have had a movie that is taken seriously, and highly regarded, not one that is regarded in some quarters as merely porn.",9 Songs
5,Boba_Fett1138,About as flat as Margo Stilley's chest.,4,26 January 2008,"Really not too sure what to think about this one. OK so all this movie does is show a relationship between two people, that is mostly based on purely the sex. But the movie just never goes deep into things (no pun intended). It's not a movie that raises or answers any questions regarding relationships or even the fact why these two are attracted to each other and what the exact status of the relationship and feelings toward each other is. You can call this movie a realistic observation if you will but that doesn't make the movie also interesting or appealing to watch.The movie gets back and forth between conversations between the two main characters, rock concerts (also not my taste of music obviously) and explicit sex sequences. The movie knows to include scenes of Antartica are included throughout, with the main character Matt flying over it and providing and providing a voice over, with wisdoms and fact about Antartica (yeah whatever!). Oh and also a Michael Nyman piano concert...The constant cutting back and forth between those sequences makes this a fairly disjointed and also definitely shallow movie to watch. Thank goodness that the movie only lasts for just over an hour because it all starts to become pretty tiresome to watch after a while, since the movie just isn't heading anywhere. The sex sequences and nudity within this movie is really explicit. Really some stuff you would normally expect to see in some porn flick, although it is obviously done with more class and style in this case.The movie definitely doesn't get uplifted by its actors. Kieran O'Brien was OK but Margo Stilley is horrible. Almost really toe cringing bad. The way she delivers her lines is awful and very amateur like and I really mean amateur like in a non-realistic way. It of course also doesn't help that the movie has (deliberatly) no character development, which makes the movie all the more shallow.But this is certainly no horrible movie. I mean, it's a definitely professionally made movie and director Michael Winterbottom is definitely not an untalented person. The movie obviously also had noble intentions. It's at least not like they wanted to make a explicit porn-flick or anything like that. That I can say for sure. It's the sort of movie that makes you say and think; Whatever! It's professionally made all but also feels pointless, since its not controversial enough for todays standards and doesn't raise any discussions or questions. So what exactly was the point of this movie, if there even was any?4/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",9 Songs
6,evanston_dad,Has It Been 9 Songs Yet?,1,22 December 2005,"This is the question you may find yourself asking repeatedly throughout this dismal movie. It takes talent to make even graphic sex scenes dull, so I guess in that regard Michael Winterbottom is a talented film maker.This movie sucks, plain and simple. It wants to be too tasteful to be outright porn, yet the explicit sex is absolutely the only thing of interest in the movie. However, you'd do better to rent a good old-fashioned porno if that's what you have the hankering for, because the sex scenes in this are so fragmentary as to be frustrating. As for the rest of the movie....wait, REST of the movie? Hah. Let's see, there are some songs performed live..yippee. The male character, called ""Brian"" for want of anything better to call him, wanders around Antartica doing his job (whatever that may be), and ruminating about how icebergs are like relationships, or people, or something. I'm sure Winterbottom thinks there's a point to this movie, but if that's the case, he's either delusional or incredibly pretentious. As for the girl, ""Lisa,"" she opens her mouth every so often to deliver a line that proves nothing but how gratingly annoying her character is. If you filmed my life for a week, you'd have a movie about as boring as this.No, I take that back. My life is more interesting than what's shown here. At least I go to work, eat, go to the gym, leave the house, walk the dog, sleep. There's some variety to my routine. These two people grow to dislike each other, but if all I did was have sex, go to a concert, then come back and have more sex, ad infinitum, I'd probably hate the person I was with too.And to top it all off, the whole movie is filmed in digital video and looks like crap. Strike three.Grade: F",9 Songs
7,christopher-underwood,like passing a room and suddenly noticing a couple,8,11 June 2007,"Bit of a surprise this because I really wasn't expecting much. What Winterbottom succeeds to do here is make a mainstream feature film without narrative structure and with explicit sex scenes. In particular, one remarkable thing he manages is to depict two people having sex and not 'take sides'. It seems that the couple are 'directing' the action and the director capturing it (and later of course editing it). With regular porn there is always a definite angle to the action and usually we see the everything from the point of view of the guy. We are drawn into the action and forced to participate or withdraw. In Winterbottom's film it is more like passing a room and suddenly noticing a couple, and pausing to watch, simply enjoying the inherent eroticism in watching two people cavorting, sexually. Tempted to mention the shortness in length, I'll simply mention that I felt the ending came to quick.",9 Songs
8,cherold,"Bad concert movie, bad porn, bad everything",2,20 August 2013,"This is not a movie. This is blandly shot concert footage interspersed with scenes of two actors having sex. The sex isn't really very good as porn, but it's not really good as anything else either; it makes naked people having unsimulated sex about as boring as possible, neither meaningful no hot. It doesn't portray a relationship, just sex. There is more story in the typical porn movie than there is in this thing.The music is horrible. If you don't hate the music that will definitely help in enjoying this movie, but even if you like it, this is not interesting concert footage.My girlfriend told me she could only make it through the first 10 minutes of this movie. That was my limit too.",9 Songs
9,MOscarbradley,Mercifully short,2,2 July 2006,"There are two good things about ""9 Songs""; the first are the songs themselves, mostly performed at Brixton Academy and interrupting the almost perpetual shagging of the film's only 2 real characters. The other is the film's length. It clocks in at a mercifully short 70 minutes, though you could be forgiven for thinking that it is much longer.Michael Winterbottom is no stranger to controversy, but this almost hard-core bonk fest is his most explicit film to date. It is also his most boring. A couple meet, have lots of sex and part. When they are not having sex, (and there is no reason to doubt that the sex isn't real), they go to the Brixton Academy and they bicker. It's like eavesdropping on a couple of not very likable individual's private lives; like 'Big Brother' where we do get to see the shagging.Winterbottom is perhaps the most eclectic of all British film-makers; he's even made a western of sorts, (a version of ""The Mayor of Casterbridge"" set in the Yukon), and at his best he gives us challenging, demanding and provocative entertainments. But this is a waste of time. It may only last an hour but if you want to see and hear the bands I am sure there are better dvds available and if you want cum-shots then buy some real porn, not this drivel.",9 Songs
10,Bored_Dragon,Do not watch even if you are bored to death,2,9 October 2016,"Porn movies have shitty story line and bunch of explicit sex, mainstream film avoids explicit sex but goes for good story. This movie is 70% explicit sex but not porn, yet it has story line at average porn movie level. That little bit of movie that is not sex is their visits to concerts with terrible music. To cut long story short - boring sex scenes, even more boring story line and music that can easily bore you to death. Screw ""artistic"" movies of this sort. It lasted 67 minutes but I yawn like I did not sleep for 67 days...If you are bored to death, better count stains on your walls than watch this movie.",9 Songs
11,kenjha,Pointless,2,19 April 2010,"The point of the title becomes obvious very quickly. The viewer is subjected to filmed concert performances of nine loud songs in their entirety by generic rock bands. The point of the film never becomes obvious. One can be thankful the film is not called ""16 Songs."" Between the songs, there is footage of a couple having sex. The couple is not particularly attractive. She's plain and boyish looking. He's shorter than her but is apparently not a midget where it counts in a film such as this. It seems the presence of the concert footage somehow gets this film classified as something other than porn. This is not a feature film. It's an extended music video. The one positive is that it's mercifully short.",9 Songs
12,sol-,True Romance,6,26 August 2017,"Having met at a rock concert and shared an intimate night together, two youths decide to continue having sexual encounters after concerts in this Michael Winterbottom movie. The film sparked controversy upon release due to its graphic depictions of sexual activity, and with little occurring in between the rock and copulation scenes, the film has been called everything from 'boring' to 'pornography' over the years. And yet, while it is true that the unconventional structure of the movie makes it hard to get immersed in the characters and story at first, the film eventually takes some interesting turns as we learn that the lovers actually share a deep love and emotional connection beyond what we have otherwise been shown. This in turn renders '9 Songs' a refreshingly different take on a romantic relationship, with only the guy's most striking memories (the sex and the music) played before our eyes. His philosophical quips about Anarctica are of interest too - ""Antarctica is the planet's memory before there was people"" - and it resonates strongly as he comments ""5000 people in a room and you can still feel alone"" after attending a concert without his lover. Sure, Winterbottom's approach here is frustrating in that we hardly get to know the characters as individuals, but with all that considered, it is pretty remarkable how strongly Winterbottom captures their emotional connection.",9 Songs
13,tomgillespie2002,The idea is more interesting than the execution,3,8 October 2017,"Michael Winterbottom is one of the most important and challenging filmmakers around. Over the past couple of decades, he has directed a prolific stream of interesting features across a variety of genres, refusing to settle on a particular style and seemingly always working on a minuscule budget. But no filmmaker is immune to producing a stinker, and after a successful 2002 which saw the release of the excellent double-header of 24 Hour Party People and In This World, Winterbottom hit a grey patch with Code 46 and 9 Songs. He would push the boundaries of what could be tolerated in terms of cinematic violence in 2010 with the divisive The Killer Inside Me, but 6 years earlier he would test the BBFC's waters with 9 Songs, a film that may still be the most sexually explicit film ever to be released in British theatres.It tells the story of two lovers: Matt (Kieran O'Brien), a British scientist, and Lisa (Margo Stilley), an American exchange student. As the film opens, the couple have broken up and Matt is heading to Antarctica to conduct research and reflect on their doomed relationship. He remembers their time together through the sex they had, and they had a lot of it. 9 Songs quickly falls into a pattern: Sex scene, concert scene, and then a trip back to desolate mountains of Antarctica. They met at Brixton Academy and share a love of live music, so between the sex we get to experience the various gigs they go to - the 9 songs of the title - shot guerrilla-style from afar over the heads of the audience, which is pretty much how most of us experience a concert. The sex is passionate, spontaneous and exciting, but love is much harder. As it becomes clear to both of them that they won't be together forever, they employ blindfolds and handcuffs to spice things up, but nothing can mask the distance opening between them.Winterbottom doesn't shy away from explicitness. We get to see full penetration, oral sex and even a money shot - pretty much everything you would expect from a cheeky browse on Pornhub. But what separates 9 Songs from pornography is the complete lack of sensationalism. There is absolutely nothing arousing about the sex, despite the attractiveness of the two leads, and this is likely what convinced the BBFC to pass it uncut (it's 'art'). The problem with 9 Songs is that the idea is infinitely more interesting than the execution. This is an incredibly dull and repetitive film, made all the more of a chore to sit through by the two thinly-realised and rather annoying characters at the forefront. Winterbottom seems to be trying to say something profound by occasionally switching the action to the South Pole, but it comes across as allegory on the level of a student-film. The concert footage is filmed with the same grungy energy as 24 Hour Party People - one of my favourite Winterbottom films - so there's some relief to be found in performances by the likes of Primal Scream, Franz Ferdinand and Black Rebel Motorcycle Club, if you're into that sort of thing.",9 Songs
14,videorama-759-859391,"Nine songs, and overly generous amounts of sex, but where did the movie go?",6,9 April 2014,"I do love this movie. When seeing it again in 2008, after a three year absence, I loved it more, so much, I watched it again, as having bought the DVD, while I was in Sydney. It was taken off the shelves in Adelaide, within about two weeks. Yes the film is very daring, and explicit, and sexy Stilley, a former model, is hot as an American student. Her acting's not. It's more done, if for naturalism. You would of seen her in that M and M's add in a green sweater, where here, she's naked for most of it. The English boyfriend, who's interesting occupation, takes him to the Antarctic, he loves so much, was a job angle I loved. Original. Stilley has struck up a hot relationship with him, where Kieren O'Brien is incredibly dull to watch, though likable, delivering an utterly terrible performance almost of void, but again too, it's done for naturalism, which is the feel I've got from the film. I don't know if these actors hailed from the same acting school as the leads from Open Water. This adult feature, that does border on porn, one scene, that pushed the envelope, which I imagine, was removed from the shelves, after a complaint, is really a love story strung together by an abundance of sex scenes, one after the other that involves a lot of lovemaking, where a beautiful thing is going on there, punctuated by rock concert scenes, featuring songs and music I loved. There's one small argument, that Stilley, with her character of vitality and looseness sparks up, which I wish had eventuated into more. At times her character is obnoxious. She does have her moods. Thank god we have her, to bring life into the relationship, in contrast to the distrait O'Brien. It does pain and sadden us, when the two part, at the end, after all the sex and love they've been through, where it is affecting, a too fitting titled, if punishing song attached to it. In fairness the 69 minute movie has the look of a half finished project, or it is, as if the other half of the movie went missing, where they're are only a couple of things that hold it together, but their things the audience love, that compensates for the notion, that may'be it's not really meant to be taken for a movie, but a very explicit and sexy experience, where those easily offended by raw sex, nudity, should steer clear. Dialogue too is scarce, of minimum number, one line has Stilley looking in the mirror, asking O'Brien, ""Do I look like a boy"". Check out her bare body, while she says that, you'll pick up on something that will have you answering ""Yes"", but I don't want to get too personal. Definitely for art house lovers, or people, who want to get their rocks off.",9 Songs
15,Chris_Docker,"Beautiful, intimate, responsible. A minor triumph.",8,20 March 2005,"This is a love-it-or-hate-it film, as reflected by the deep divisions in critical response. It is a serious piece of film-making but there are two major components that you may love or hate - extreme sexual explicitness and modern rock music.The rock music is mostly from live concerts. If the music that people pogue and stage dive to is not for you, you probably won't want to sit through an hour of it (check the soundtrack listings - Black Rebel Motorcycle Club, Von Bondies, Salif Keita, Franz Ferdinand, Primal Scream, Dandy Warhols, Goldfrapp, Super Furry Animals, Elbow - do you recognise/like a few of them?) The sexual explicitness is a matter of personal taste - and tastes in sexuality vary a lot. If you can identify or empathise to some extent to this 20-some young couple and feel comfortable seeing how their relationship develops through sex and rock music you may, as I did, find it beautiful and intimate. The lovemaking is so natural that it is in sharp contrast to the fictionalised and very artificial sex scenes in mainstream films. There's also some wonderful symbolism in contrasting shots and details of Antarctica (connected to the daytime work of the main character). It's also a triumph British cinema that the Censors have allowed it to reach mainstream cinemas uncut.",9 Songs
16,noralee,How You can be Inside a Person without Getting Inside a Person,5,3 August 2005,"""9 Songs"" asks the rhetorical question: ""If a guy is stuck in Antarctica, what will he be thinking about that he misses?"" Answer: ""1. Sex. 2. Rock 'n' roll. 3. Food 4. Getting high. 5. Pre and post-coital cuddling."" His stream of consciousness is set off by musing something like ""in Antarctica you feel both claustrophobic and agoraphobic--like when two people are in bed."" The film is in effect a young British scientist's visual mix tape of memories of an affair he had with a ""crazy"" American woman.Framed by mostly rock performances they saw together, whose lyrics may have some narrative resonance, at least the second one by Black Rebel Motorcycle Club does, we only see the relationship from his point of view, where it didn't much matter if they went on holiday to the seashore or celebrated his birthday at a hotel, as he remembers they pretty much only shared sex-- active, thumping, experimental, mutually pleasurable, no inch neglected exploratory, safe sex.There's hints that she has a life beyond him - phone calls with work and friends and an apartment she only has him over to once. But does he ever ask about her secrets, or as long as they're making love that's what he defines as love? He is supportive further on as she mysteriously cries and he questions her taking of prescription drugs, and even does try to get her to eat, but does he even remember any other conversations with her about her problems? Her issues, of course, only stay in his consciousness as it affects his having sex, she is the one who mostly directs their sexual activities, such as her concerns that her thin body looks like a boy's and her sexual fantasies of voluptuous women that leave him out a couple of times, regardless of how many times he demonstrates that her body turns him on. They had enough of a conversation for her to know to get him a relevant birthday present, so I think their dialog just doesn't register in his recall, in what we see and hear.So I would like to see writer/director Michael Winterbottom add a ""she said"" version, of her perceptions of the same relationship -- heck maybe she left because she knew he'd be going off to do research. Because what more did he want? What else did she need? We aren't shown through his eyes.The film visually demonstrates that you can be inside a person without getting inside a person. In Antarctica at least a man is an island. This film may be an ironic commentary that 90% of sex is really mental.Suggestion to those seeing this film in a movie theater: eat your popcorn during the loud music, as everyone gets very silent during the many scenes of explicit sex, which gives equal time to aroused and climaxing genitalia of both genders.The live performances by BRMC, the Von Bondies, Elbow, Primal Scream, the Dandy Warhols, Super Furry Animals and Franz Ferdinand effectively capture a club gig, grungy acoustics with the crush of waving bodies and all, plus there's a brief, surprising view of a formal Michael Nyman concert to show us that the two characters do own nice clothes.",9 Songs
17,fertilecelluloid,"For mine, Winterbottom's only total failure",2,10 August 2005,"I nearly fell off my seat when I read just below the IMDb entry for this film: ""If you like this title -- 9 SONGS -- we also recommend TEENY EXZESSE 60 - LUSTGESCHREI IN INTERNAT"". I know the TEENY EXZESSE series well and Ep. 60 is no better or worse than the other entries as hardcore schoolgirl action goes, but master pornmeister Harry S. Morgan must be mighty chuffed to see his fine X-rated work equated with the latest entry in Michael Winterbottom's oeuvre.I'm unhappy to report that TEENY EXZESSE 60 is a far more entertaining work than 9 SONGS. It is, at least, erotic and features performers with some sexual chemistry.There is a focus on songs in Winterbottom's film, but the coverage on them is uninspired and usually shot from the perspective of the punter with the worst seat in the house.The leads, Margot Stilley and Kieran O'Brien, meet at the first concert, go back to Kieran's pad, and have sex. This first sex scene is the best because it feels new, fresh and tentative. The sex scenes that follow are simply dull. There isn't even much passion between these two. They're two actors performing for the camera who convey no internal desire.The film's marketing focused on the fact that the sex is real and shown to be real. Big deal! You can't hang a premise on a gimmick and succeed. Winterbottom fails because he relies on the sex to convey the emotional journeys of the characters. Since the sex lacks passion, the characters' journeys come across as vapid.If the film was softcore with the same nine songs, it would probably not have gotten made at all.For mine, Winterbottom's only total failure.Hire the entire TEENY EXZESSE series instead, turn the sound down, play the 9 SONGS soundtrack, and enjoy! Or better, track down some of David Frazer's gorgeous X-rated work such as PINK LAGOON, SURRENDER IN PARADISE or HANKY PANKY.",9 Songs

Two people, a man and a woman, are having all sorts of penetration and so, oral and vaginal, then some orgasm, and all is surrounded with 9 excellent rock songs. Anybody understood anything? Me not. I am not a fan of so-called ""smart porn"". That is, still porn, but this time with some plot (ooo, does anyone here watch a plot if there are hard core porn scenes?)

19,jromanbaker,What frontiers ?,1,24 July 2021,"' Real ' sex could be seen especially between men and women way before 2004, even in films like ' Empire of the Sexes ' ( a much better film ) way far back in countries like France in the 1970's. Plus again there were ' real ' films depicting homosexuals. In cinemas for both forms of natural sexuality. So what frontiers did this film make ?Painfully I watched the long hour and if memory serves me right eleven minutes of a boring relationship interspersed with music that I had absolutely no interest in. The acting seemed null and void, and there was one factor that I found lacking; that sense of real eroticism that makes ' real ' sex a truly celebratory and joyful sight, and where you can forget the ' real ' world of exploding devices and other deadly forms, mainly due to the heteronormative desire to kill. The sexual bondage scenes, the drug taking and the lack of what to me appeared true chemistry between the two leads depressed me. That others have an opposite view of this film is their right, and it does not please me to give a cinematic experience one point above zero.",9 Songs
20,Philby-3,Deep meaningless sex,5,27 February 2007,"This film is yet another example of Michael Winterbottom's versatility. One peculiar aspect of it is that the scenes of lovemaking are divided by songs (hence the title). The film is only a little over 60 minutes so we get 30 minutes of music and 30 minutes of sex. It's fairly gentle, loving sex, with a short foray into mild bondage at the end, but it is indisputably real sex. There is a rather wistful atmosphere because with the opening scenes of a light plane flying low over the Antarctic wastes it is clear that Matt (Kieran O'Brien) is reflecting on the past, on his short affair with Lisa, a younger American woman in London. Matt is a glaciologist who spends his time uncovering the secrets of the earth's past. Lisa's background is not sketched in. In fact we learn little about her except that she does rather like sex and doesn't have to fall hopelessly in love with someone to enjoy their body. Matt is left only with a few warm memories.The 9 songs are mostly noisy rock numbers from bands playing in the cavernous Brixton Academy, though there is at least one decent Michael Nyman number. It seems Matt and Lisa both like the stuff (they first meet there) and the songs kind of punctuate the relationship, but again, there is not a great deal of meaning.Matt is played by Kieran O'Brien, previously seen as Fitz's difficult teenage son in ""Cracker"", and he certainly meets the physical demands his role requires. Margo Stilley as Lisa plays her in an uncomplicated fashion. I thought they were both pretty brave to do this and I hope it doesn't hurt their careers. It was something of an achievement to get this film past the censors but it clearly falls into the ""Art"" rather than ""Pornography"" category. I do wonder though, as I did with ""Shortbus,"" what's coming next. I don't think, even in adult love stories I want to see all the anatomical detail. I'd much rather have some crackling dialogue or even just some nice scenery.",9 Songs
21,rainking_es,Winterbottom keeps going' down...,3,18 November 2006,"There's not much to say about ""9 songs"": images of a couple fornicating all around the place and some live performances of (hype) rock bands, those that thrill the English . The couple is in to anything: fetichism, sado, bondage the regular stuff, you know. Of course, all the scenes have been filmed in a explicit way (elegant porn, some idiot would say).As for the music, well, if you like The Dandy Warhols, Franz Ferdinand, Primal Scream go for it.

22,itamarscomix,"Not that bad, not that good",6,17 January 2012,"Reviews about 9 Songs seem to divide up between the 1's and the 10's, mostly based on the reviewer's attitude towards explicit sex scenes in a film. So let's get this out of the way: yes, the film has a lot of explicit, unsimulated sex. No, I don't find anything wrong with it. Actually, I find the uproar completely hypocritical, because I can name, off the top of my head, a dozen films that presented sex, while simulated, in a much more disturbing, violent, negative manner. The sex in 9 Songs is only between two consenting adults, with no orgies, pedophilia, bestiality, roughness or BDSM in sight - no homosexuality even! So it seems the one thing those prudes are complaining about is the fact that the sex is real - but it makes very little difference on-screen, only in those people insecure minds.In fact, the one thing 9 Songs truly excels at is portraying a very realistic sexual relationship, one based on attraction, lust and physical chemistry, which anyone who has ever been in a healthy sexual relationship can tell. The relationship between the two characters isn't idealized, nor is it presented as abhorrent or vile. The film's impressive achievement is providing a virtual window into real people with real lives, a real relationship with real feelings and real passion. The sex scenes aren't porn, nor are they the romanticized fluff of the soft-porn erotic thrillers of the 80's; while the sex itself is real, there's substantial acting talent on show in how real their feelings and lust seem on-screen.Unfortunately, that's not quite enough to make it a satisfying film. The characters feel like real people, but we get to know very little about them - we go through the film as peeping toms, seeing them in their most private moments, but we get no kind of insight, and we have no reason to care about their relationship. If, on the other hand, the film tries to make some sort of broader, more universal statement about the human condition or about sexuality, it fails at that too - the relationship between the two characters is good, it's healthy and then it ends. At the end, it's hard to see any point to the film, other than some well-directed, well made sex scenes that might have been taken from a longer, more interesting film. I'd have preferred to get twenty minutes more that would give me a hint as to what, if anything, 9 Songs is trying to say.As it is, it seems that the film's only purpose is to prove that unsimulated, explicit sex has a place in a legitimate film, and in that it's a great success; while the content may be considered by some to be pornographic, the way it's made and the way it's presented isn't, and 9 Songs is indeed a legitimate film. It's just not a very good one. Now that the point is proved, I'm waiting to see another director make it.",9 Songs
23,TheNorthernMonkee,pointless,1,6 November 2005,"SPOILERS Love, sex, rock and roll. One of the most controversial films of recent years, in 2004 Michael Winterbottom released ""9 Songs"". Intended as an artistic piece to demonstrate the love of a relationship through sex and a passion for music, the film failed on so many levels. Featuring actual sexual content, the film revolves between music gigs and sex scenes. Whilst there's no argument about the music (one of the finest soundtracks in years), the whole point of the film and it's sexuality are irrelevant.Matt (Kieran O'Brien) meets Lisa (Margo Stilley) at a gig. Lisa is an American and for a year she lives in London as the two embark upon a passionate love affair.It's of little real surprise that Stilley didn't want her name associated with this film. Spending the majority of the film naked and in various states of sexual position, she manages to do the unthinkable and remove all emotion and eroticism from a highly erotic act. The sex is more hardcore than most pornography, and yet Michael Winterbottom manages to turn it into an emotionless and benign affair. The film is voyeuristic, but without any sort of relevance to it, the sex becomes irrelevant and after ten minutes, you begin to question why you are watching this garbage.The actors are awful. Whether in bed or actually clothed (rare), they fail on so many levels to act. Stilley is a weak and aimless actress and O'Brien, whilst he obviously shows signs of standards, is woefully inadequate. This just makes the film even more irrelevant. Most flaws with the film could be easily forgiven if we could just feel any sort of connection or realism about the characters. For 70minutes plus, we watch them engage and communicate, but never once do we actually care about who they are and whether they will actually stay together or not. We know they are a fictitious couple, and through a combination of woeful acting and bad camera work, it is impossible to find any sort of reality.Of course, events probably would have been better if Michael Winterbottom could have found two actors who have a bit of sexual chemistry. Introducing them to each other only a few days prior to filming, he's found two actors with a complete lack of chemistry and who feel forced.In fact, mix the woeful actors with Michael Winterbottom's direction, and the film becomes even more dire in your eyes. Whether in the bedroom or at the concert, using a hand-held camera, Winterbottom gives you a vomit inducing image which is incapable of staying still. At the concerts, you feel like you are actually drunkenly dancing in the background to your favourite tracks. That's something really.Just so as not to be completely unfair to Michael Winterbottom's farce of a film, the soundtrack really is immense. Franz Ferdinand, Black Rebel Motorcycle Club, Elbow, and others, at least we get to listen to decent music.Seriously though, the idea of trying to show a year long British relationship is not a particularly bad idea, and the general theory behind the film is actually alright. The problem though is that his final piece is not up to the task. It is badly written, badly acted, badly planned, badly shot, and so unbelievably awful, that everyone involved should feel ashamed.A good soundtrack and an original concept cannot make a film. By using awful camera angles, minimal plot, no characterisation and a pair of woeful actors with absolutely no sexual chemistry, Michael Winterbottom has created a farce.",9 Songs

But what the hell it really looked great, all in all.I was surprised that it got such a low review grade, but it was to be expected since modern audience expects Hollywood blockbusters, but this is not that type of film. Not that I have anything against above mentioned blockbusters, but rather I enjoy these types of films very much.It is a pity that they are not available anymore to the wider public, but that is trend in the last 10 to 15 years that good film get to be shown only at the festivals.

26,CountZero313,ill-conceived outing from a director who can do better,2,1 August 2008,"Code 46, In This World, 24 Hour Party People: Mike Winterbottom has made strong, entertaining, thought-provoking films in the past. His 1999 collaboration with Michael Nyman, Wonderland, left me speechless when I saw it in the theatre. He took the everyday and mundane and made it sparkle. He made it profound.How, then, did this lazy, ill-disciplined project ever find its way to screens? Winterbottom claims he wanted to show two people making love. What you get is two actors having sex. Not two actors acting, just two actors having sex. In the interview on the DVD extras Winterbottom claims Oshima's In The Realm of the Senses as an inspiration for Nine Songs. Oshima shows explicit sex but as part of an all-consuming passion two people have for each other. He doesn't sacrifice narrative and characterisation for some immature experiment in erotica. The debate Winterbottom is trying to create has very little relevance in our multimedia internet age.Winterbottom got to film some of his favourite bands, recycle some Nyman tunes, and shoot pseudo-porn footage that he then cobbled together and labelled an experiment. I suspect that white powder the actors were sniffing may not have been a prop, and it wasn't just the actors snorting it up, either.Nine Songs is a guileless aberration from an otherwise worthy filmmaker.The debate about the sex is all smoke and mirrors to divert us from the fact that this is a boring, insipid film. One for Winterbottom to live down to.",9 Songs
27,sashank_kini-1,"Sex As It Is- Naughty, Thrilling, Pleasure-Giving and Ultimately Satisfying",5,14 December 2011,"'9 songs' is about sex- songs just act as fillers here. The music- 'Indie', not my cup of tea. The interactions other that love-making between the two protagonists- minimal and trivial. The Antarctica plot is a possible depiction of coldness, isolation. Story is said from the viewpoint of Mark, the male part here. Lisa, on the other hand, is his lover, partner and muse. There is sex- plenty of it with moaning, panting, teasing, slapping, arousing, caressing, touching and hardcore f***ing. At times with calm, entrancing music in the background. Then there's that annoying clock goof that I noticed- why are there such goofs in a short film like this? The runtime of the film is about 68 minutes, however the pace of '9 songs' dreary, partly because more could have been done with the plot and the music. When I think sex music, names like Lil Kim, Snoop Dogg, Madonna, Janet Jackson and many male rappers come in my head. Rock music too can evoke passions, but the songs here, except one or two, were disposable. But the sex is clean- difficult to believe, right? It's because it wasn't made for the viewers to jerk off nor was it made to show exploitation- as in the disturbing 'Caligula'.'9 Songs' is certainly better than 'porn' and it is not that bad a film either. The two actors should not have received so much flak- they certainly had guts to do it.My Rating: 5/10",9 Songs
28,Imdbidia,"Good music, poor script",4,25 February 2011,"A controversial daring movie that has many good elements, and a original concept, but is overall wasted by a poor script and dialogs.This is the story of the romance of a young couple,an English geologist and a student American girl, and of their short-lived relationship in London. The story is connected by the nine songs that give title to the movie.The depiction of the relationship, the home scenes of cooking, chatting or having sex are very warm, fresh, natural and realistic,with a great naivety and charm. I did not feel at all that I was watching soft core as some reviews mention. This movie goes beyond where most movies and actors would go, as most of the sex in the movie is non-simulated. However, the sex scenes are very tender, intimate and natural, and portray the reality of what a couple's every-day sex can be - unglamorous but also warm and emotional.I found the relationship real, fresh and believable, nicely portrayed by the two actors. The problem with the story is not the actors, but the poor script and dialogs, and the poor editing, too, which is is the problem of the screenwriter and the director.The downs of the movie are specially the structuring of the script, the dialogs, the overloading with sex scenes, and the fact that we barely see anything of the reality of the two characters beyond their being together. For example, the couple met in a concert, but we do not see how that meeting happened, how they connected, with whom they were when that happened, and how they ended living together and having a relationship. We barely know about their personal life outdoors and their friends. The music is the paving on which the characters walk on, so why they don't talk about the music in the concerts they attend to, why they like those bands or those songs? In that regard, there is a disconnection between the relationship and the music, even though the couple attend all those concerts in which the songs are played.However, we have all the Antarctica part, which is beautiful to watch, a sort of documentary patch in which nothing of what is said or shown serves to add depth or meaning to the movie, the male character, or the story of the couple. One wonders why, the relationship being the focus, the director shifted his focus so easily from it. The relationship is well sketched but not fully developed, and the viewer resents that.I found the music terrific, especially Nyman's pieces, but all of the nine life songs, and those others that are part of the sound track, are great and not mainstream.This is not a movie for puritans or for people with prejudices. If you are easy to scandalize, just don't watch it. If you decide to do so, at least open your mind and don't catalog it before watching it.",9 Songs
29,dragokin,"9 songs, some sex scenes and a weak plot",1,18 May 2013,"I like watching independent movies which bring forward music of bands unknown to a wider audience. This way you get to know some interesting artists, although statistically the result is the same when browsing through music channels or radio stations. With smaller bands, though, the surprise is bigger, since you source from every possible shade of music and noise and the experience is much more exciting than with commercial music.Anyhow, after watching 9 Songs there were no musical jewels and the notorious scenes of explicit sex were not exciting either. I even presume they were introduced to capture the attention of media, critics and viewers, since there was nothing else to offer.As far as plot is concerned, i'm amazed that independent movies often showcase offbeat characters that apparently represent the alternative to what should be mainstream population that obediently works, mates and consumes while waiting for retirement. These are often unstable personalities with artistic tendencies who know better what life is about.In this sense, in the meeting of main characters the universes collide, though on a micro scale. The male lead has sort of career, while the main female cast member is some kind of connoisseur of art of living. It is unclear whether this kind of romance would last.It is true that in today's global world it is possible to meet the partner of your dreams in strangest places and under most curious circumstances. However, 9 Songs didn't bring that over in an interesting way. Composing a playlist with music videos, porn and documentaries would cause the similar effect as this movie.",9 Songs
30,Angeneer,There's something about it,7,29 March 2006,"Bad marketing has hurt this movie irreversibly. Yes, 9 Songs is sexually explicit. But the presentation of the sex is not at all pornographic. It's realistic. In fact, this is one of the most realistic depictions of a couple's love life I have ever seen. And, let's face it, this is what guys are nostalgic of when they are somewhere far away from it. True, there is no actual plot line, but the film is mainly built on recollections of images, not in a plot. After all, at your early twenties, your life revolves around sex, music and drugs and there's not really any dramatic element that is movie material.And yes, the film could do with less sex, but here comes the experimental aspect of it. Winterbottom tries to see if he can get away with it. He does, because of his accomplished direction, which is what keeps 9 Songs marginally on the artsy side. Without it, it's just a porn flick. This is a director's film in every way.As a side-dish, you get to enjoy good indie rock and brit-pop from top acts (plus Michael Nyman) and also get a scent of beautiful London.",9 Songs

32,skay_baltimore,Meh...no great shakes,6,9 April 2012,"IMO, this movie has no real direction and totally lacks focus. It's half soft core porn, half music/concert video. The real issue I found is that Margo Stilley is simply not that hot. Her orgasms are lukewarm at best, as are pretty much the rest of her character's expressions. The most intense orgasm she has is when she's masturbating while her partner stands in the doorway watching her, looking totally depressed. Either Stilley herself, or the character she portrays, is a cold, uptight individual, almost incapable of letting go. (i.e. she demands that her partner go ""faster and harder"", yet when she's on top/in supposed control, she does nothing herself to speed up her body movements) So what good does it do to have this ""ground breaking"", ""real"" sexual portrayal, if the best you can present is a conflicted, uptight model? As a result, there's little if any real movement in this film (literally or figuratively). It felt stilted, stagnant, and just not that hot. At least in terms of the sexuality it presented. The music, on the other hand, at least had some genuine energy.It's possible, of course, that the real genius of the movie is that it managed to present -- intentionally or not -- the sad reality that after you try a couple of different sexual positions/techniques dozens and dozens of times, over and over again, sex tends to recede into the background (just ask any married couple). So if the intent of the film was to show how sex as an end unto itself is rather lacking, then the film succeeded. If the intent of the film was to show how great sex is and how hot these two people are, then it was a total failure.",9 Songs

It shows a hell of a lot of sex and it's all very in your face, but all of the sex is real. It's very realistic and I love that, but I wish it focused more on the couple's emotional relationship instead of their physical one. It seems like the entire point of the film is to show real sex, but then when it actually gets to the sex scenes it shows like the opening minute and then cuts to when it's over and their cuddling which really defeated the purpose for me. So it has a strong, brave purpose but it barely even investigates that purpose. Then, the concert scenes just completely rip you out of the beautiful relationship of the couple and doesn't feel like there is any purpose at all. So, while I appreciate the vision, the film is poorly done.",9 Songs
34,nobbytatoes,interesting portrayal on relationship,7,29 July 2005,"Matt is in Antarctic on account of his job. While he is there he remember the relationship he left. The rest of the movie is made up of flash backs on his relationship with Lisa. All the flash backs contain when Matt and Lisa are at the concerts they attend; 9 concerts in all, and when they are having sex.What is annoying and so interesting about 9 songs is that there is no story line. As the movie is a splice of flash backs, though they run chronologically, they don't make a story line; so the movie doesn't really go anywhere and you don't learn anything about them. But this is whats so interesting about it. If you keep in mind that it is a retrospective, Matt is remembering the best times of the relationship; and that is when he is having sex with Lisa and when they attend the concerts.9 songs has been called one of the most sexually explicit movie of our age. This can be rightly so as this does have real sex scenes. But though it does have real sex scenes, this isn't in the fashion of a pornographic movie. A lot of the time in the sex scenes, most of the time we only see extreme close ups of the faces or other part of their body. With this style of filming, the sex scenes aren't that confronting; but there is a lot of nudity. The movie was shot on high definition hand held cameras, so the quality is fuzzy and shaky, so you don't get a complete feel of the surroundings.The bands at the concerts have The Dandy Warhols, Elbow, Franz Ferdinand, Black Rebel Motorcycle Club, The Von Bondies, Primal Scream, Super Furry Animals.9 songs runs much in the vein of 'In the realm of the senses', a Japanese movie which also had a couple which we only see having sex the entire movie. Though 9 songs can be confronting at times, it lacks a lot of substance; from the lack of no story line. But this is one of the most interesting portrayal of a couples relationship. There are a lot of metaphors in here as well. The best is when Matt says that being in bed with someone can be so claustrophobic and agoraphobic at the same time.Though i would say you should see this movie, but for a better movie that uses sex as a main point on a couples relationship, the movie Intimacy is much better.",9 Songs
35,CelluloidRehab,A Failed Experiment,2,30 December 2005,"What attracted me to this movie ?? Perhaps it was the tag line : ""The sequences involving Matt and Lisa are intimate and realistic (be warned--the sex in the film is real and graphic)"".The premise of the movie is simple : Matt reminisces about his former lover, Lisa, while on a scientific expedition to Antarctica. Thats it. The rest of the movie is a series of flashbacks to their relationship. Their relationship has three main components : 1) sleeping and laying in bed 2) going to rock concerts3) lots and lots of sex There's also the occasional coke, cigarettes, drinking, cooking, eating, strip club, vibrator, and ""conversation"". It is mostly the first three, however. I give Michael Winterbottom a lot of credit for his previous efforts, especially Code 46 (which I thought was elegant and meaningful). He attempts to bridge the gap of porn and art, by including actual sex as part of the story and acting. Its too bad that he focuses on the sex but forgets about the dialog and acting. Kieran O'Brien (Matt) does a descent job considering the circumstances and that fact that he worked pro bono. Margo Stilley (Lisa) is horrible. She can't act and looks like a starving crack whore (she must have worked for peanut butter on bread, sprinkled with crack rock). Unfortunately, if porn and art was ever possible, Winterbottom has probably pushed it back to the 50's. The future of movies is away from the studio system and more to the independent creative vision. The high water mark (so far) of this is Sin City and the low water mark (the sewer) is this movie.I will not delve into a discussion of art and what is and isn't acceptable. I will simply talk about the merits of this movie. I have given this movie two stars, and that was for the music. Actually, this would have been a far better movie if he cut 40 minutes of the ""story"" and just left the music. His use of a hand-cam fails miserably. It is suppose to convey closeness and neo-realism. Instead it comes off as someone's home video or better yet a film school student trying to get into his favorite club for free by telling people he's shooting a rock-umentary (pull out your family videos or your last vacation for reference). The dialog and acting is atrocious. Everything seems improvised. This is funny because that is exactly what it is. In an interview with the director, he even mentions that he had no script. Well Mr.Bottom, in that case make sure the people you choose know how to improvise. If Ed Wood was alive he might have enjoyed the dialog in this movie. It might even have been something he would have wrote. Now to the main selling point, the sex. BORING, BORING, BORING !! This movie was so boring..... (the appropriate response would be : how boring was it ?). It was so boring that it actually made me angry. There's nothing I hate more than a movie that sells sex and then falls ""short"". I could have fallen asleep, while they were having sex on top of me. There's amateur porn that is 100x better than this. Winterbottom would have been better served if he made actual porn, with actual veteran (or even up-and-coming) porn stars instead of this. There is porn with better dialog, acting and much more satisfying sex. At this point I just want to wash myself in sulfuric acid just to get clean after watching this movie, or better yet basking in the glow of Johnny Wad. Again, this movie is boring and it goes nowhere. It feels like the failed attempt of a film student trying to make a combination rock-umentary, discovery channel, home video porn using starving and coked out actors, while satisfying his own voyeuristic fetish, to the soundtrack of his favorite bands. It is a failed movie wrapping itself in the comforting blanket of ""artsy"" and avant-garde when it needs a trash bag instead.",9 Songs
36,valis1949,Nuclear Chemistry,8,5 March 2009,"9 SONGS was the first film featuring explicit sex scenes to receive a certificate in the Republic of Ireland. Michael Winterbottom's provocative work attempts to blend two film genres: art house porn and the rock documentary. The rather thin storyline examines a few months in the sexual affair of a young couple. In between intense and explicit sexual encounters, they attend nine different concert dates. The tale is told as an erotic flashback as the man, a British glaciologist, remembers how he was left by his American-student lover. Neither one was particularly in love, but closer to 'in lust', and it was the girl who initiates the breakup which kind of adds a feminist twist. I find it refreshing that Winterbottom has made a serious attempt to introduce this kind of sexual storytelling into mainstream cinema. Why can the average teenager witness and consider all forms of murder and mayhem, and yet not have the slightest inkling of what goes on within the context of a sexual relationship? The movie does not elevate the mechanics of the sexual encounters to any degree, but employs them to demonstrate the couple's excessive desire. After viewing the film, I don't think that one comes away with any intense romantic or sexual feeling, in fact, the film is more of a mundane chronicle of a passionate affair. And, the director incorporates many of the cultural accouterments common to people in this age group; cutting edge rock'n'roll, casual drug and alcohol use, and fierce, vehement sexual couplings. If you are easily offended by graphic sexuality, this is not the film for you. But, 9 SONGS succeeds in providing an accurate and realistic portrait of a highly intense, yet rather insignificant sexual encounter in the lives of two individuals",9 Songs

Though I haven't seen enough of Michael Winterbottom's films to really judge his overall career, '9 Songs' is certainly a blemish on it, but the question is, would I have actually bothered with this movie if the controversial subject matter did not exist? I don't deplore sex in movies, but please have a reasonable plot with this sort of experimental art-house that feels the need to inundate with actual real sex on cinema! Make the plot interesting.

It's most intriguing if you sort of switch yourself off and take the role as one of the lead characters.

Basically what we have here is a series of totally graphic sex scenes featuring this couple, interspersed with nine songs, all performed at the same club, but by different musical groups (including The Dandy Warhols, Super Furry Animals, Elbow, Franz Ferdinand, Primal Scream, Black Rebel Motorcycle Club, and the Von Bondies).A few times there are brief scenes of Matt's latest expedition to Antarctica, linked to a strained metaphor in which living way down under is likened to a love relationship, or some such. The point of the film escapes me, unless it's the coup of getting graphic sex into a commercial big screen movie.There really is no story. Eventually Lisa goes back to the U.S. and seems happy about it. The sex scenes are actually pretty exciting, held back from the brink of boredom by their brevity and the punctuation of the musical interlude. I wondered if Winterbottom hired porn actors for the roles. But O'Brien has quite a list of (mostly TV) acting roles to his credit. Can't tell about Ms. Stilley: this is her first credited film acting job. The director is challenging big screen film norms but the product still leaves much to be desired. My grade: C+ 5.5/10.",9 Songs

44,bbhlthph,Why did this sensitive story of a contemporary affair raise such a storm?.,7,12 November 2010,"This is another of the numerous films which chronicle the history of a short affair. Not surprisingly such films became very popular during World War II; and for me 'Brief Encounter' remains the finest erotic film ever created, but in its style and pacing '9 Songs' owes more to '9 1/2 weeks' which provided a template that has been followed by many more recent films. In '9 Songs"" the spacing element that controls the timing of the affair is a series of nine rock concerts attended by the couple; but their relationship, although very fresh, is not as impersonal as it was in '9 1/2 weeks'. This film brings out the very real problem young people today face in building a career at the time when strong biological urges dictate that their first call should be to create a family. Whilst not taking sides in any obvious way, it is made very clear that the demands of society can often be impossible to reconcile with our instinctive urges. It features a young man who works as a research scientist in Antarctica except for brief periods of leave in London, England. A common attraction for rock music leads to friendship with a student from the U.S.A., who will only be in London for a very limited time before she has to return to the U.S.A. They can either ignore each other or respond to their mutual attraction whilst recognising that any continuing relationship appears virtually impossible, and they choose to accept the latter alternative. This award winning film provides a very sensitive and thought provoking glimpse of the type of relationship that can develop under such circumstances.Like many similar films, '9 Songs' started as a film festival project. It was featured at Sundance, the Toronto Festival and also at San Sebastian where it was an award winner. It then received a limited general circulation on the strength of its festival record, but its backers probably recognised from the start that its greatest returns should come from DVD sales, a situation which often makes it hard to decide whether the theatrical release or the Director's Cut DVD should be regarded as the definitive version. Whilst the latter is usually sexually more graphic, the greater differences in this case appear to be regionally based. The storm began when Michael Winterbottom, the Director, went on record as wishing to blur or break the distinction between softcore and hardcore sex which is currently maintained by the mainstream movie industry. I have strong reservations about this. Films are created by actors trained to simulate every kind of activity and emotion. There seems no reason why the simulation of sexual activity should necessarily be any less satisfactory for a normal audience than its actual performance.. An actor is never going to be asked to kill or wound his colleagues, we readily accept that when this appears to take place it is simulated. Today the same is true even of sequences involving the apparent death of animals, and there is no reason why it should not also be true of explicit sexual activities. However I watched the unrated Canadian version of the DVD which runs for five minutes less than at least one of the versions referred to in other IMDb user reviews, and did not include some sequences IMDb viewers in Europe have discussed. It contained nothing that I have not also seen in many other mainstream films. Those who are uncomfortable with any nudity or any simulation of sexual activity will of course choose to give this DVD a miss - others need feel no concern. The film is a serious attempt to take a realistic look at one of the problems associated with the society in which we live today, and in my view drawing attention to such problems can do nothing but good. My version of the DVD made no implicit attempt to preach to us - it simply presented an entertaining and well made story which brought out some of the problems inherent in our present day lifestyles. Basic requirements for viewer enjoyment are fully satisfied. The film-script is largely believable; the cinematography is competently done (some of the sequences featuring Antarctica are alone sufficient to justify watching the film); the acting, particularly by the young couple who carry most of the acting burden right through the entire film, was, I felt, remarkably natural; and the all important rock music sound track (which I am too deaf to assess for myself) has been commended by many others. This film is not intended to be a tearjerker, the couple concerned knew the implications of the situation in which they found themselves and got as much pleasure and satisfaction out of their brief romance as they could possibly have expected. But many older viewers who have been blessed with lifelong supportive relationships starting at a similar stage in their own lives, will probably look back over their own good fortune, and may even experience a hint of damp eyes from sympathy with the dilemma faced by the couple portrayed here. Unfortunately however, whilst remaining an enjoyable movie, '9 Songs' was too documentary in style and too short to enable its principal characters to become adequately developed, a problem that also led to unacceptably frequent and over-abrupt switches from domestic bliss to frenzied rock concerts - filmed in totally incompatible ways. I first intended to give '9 Songs' an IMDb rating of 6, but I unexpectedly found the film quite hard to forget - not because of any of the controversial sexual sequences, but because of its treatment of an affair that circumstances would never allow to become a romance. This aspect of the film has had little discussion here, but because of it I am raising my rating to 7.",9 Songs
45,Ozzy2000,For those who love Porn,4,5 July 2008,This film is amongst the very worst and most boring films I have ever seen. The production values don't even exists and most student films I have seen (that is High school students) have done better. It contains gratuitous sex of a very unattractive couple interspersed with mindless so called music performances.I usually think if a movie is really bad it can at least be entertaining this doesn't even have any pornographic significance its just plain poorly shot trashed. I am baffled it was released on the big screen let alone as a DVD rental.

Fair enough - so why was the explicit sex included?Simple, without the sex scenes the film would not have generated the slightest interest or DVD sales - just another batch of three-chord bands jumping around the stage.So, there you have it - a few minutes of hard core sex with a beautiful girl and an hour of trashy bands that you have to fast forward through.I have no objection to explicit sex but what I find objectionable in this film is the pretence; it claims to be about a relationship when it is nothing more than an exploitation movie.

I was ripped off.I think I get the origin of the title. There were nine, ear-splitting, 200-decibel rock songs (each representing something), punctuated by nine interludes (or more) of sex (often unsimulated), complemented by unrelenting TALK about sex. Sexual explicitness masquerading as art does not a good movie make (and there are more than a few examples out there to prove it). To his credit, I think director Michael Winterbottom was aiming for a profound statement about the nature of contemporary society, but it just didn't work. He went off the track somewhere.Nine Songs does have some striking scenery of endless wind-swept snowy tundra that is supposedly Antarctica (the 'hero' is a geologist). These images look more like the Northwest Territories in Canada to me, but I'm quibbling. I think these frozen landscapes are supposed to be metaphorical contrasts to the barren landscapes of our 'hot,' sexually obsessed society. Nice try.",9 Songs
49,Balthazar-5,Most people don't seem to get the subtlety.,7,5 May 2005,"I am ambiguous about Michael Winterbottom's work. 'Jude' was one of the finest literary adaptations of its era, 'The Claim' is a rich and complex work, but the 'socio-political' thread in his work seems, generally to yield, largely, dross. Maybe I wouldn't have bothered with this film had the local radio station not asked me to put the 'cinematic' point of view in a moral debate on it.I would have to say that twenty minutes in, I thought I wouldn't be defending it. We are thrown so unceremoniously into the first sexual encounter, that 'wham, bang, thank you ma'am' doesn't even come into it, and emotionless sex is no more acceptable when given the gloss of a well-known director.But, in spite of feeling decidedly uncomfortable, I stuck it out, and - a week later - it has grown in my mind (and I do not mean grown in my pants). It has grown stylistically, as I can now see Winterbottom's stylistic strategy. The first few sexual encounters are extremely fragmented and consist, largely of close-ups of various and not very easily identifiable parts of the two bodies coalescing. The editing is paced very fast, and with the fragmentation this gives the impression of furious and breathless activity, which, is surely how lovers 'perform' in the heat of desperate early coupling - where each is, in some way trying to consume the other. As the film goes on, the fragmentation decreases and sex becomes more contemplative and thoughtfully exploratory. The reduction of fragmentation continues until in the final lovemaking, it is almost continuous - suggesting the couple had 'totally' explored each other. It has grown thematically too. 'Is there a theme to a film which consists almost entirely of actual sex and pop music??' I hear someone say. Well, yes, there is. Matt is a geologist who is exploring the permafrost deep in the Antarctic. Why? He could surely have had any job - bar tender, bus conductor, orchestra conductor, film critic. But no, because what his work does is to look into the distant past and the fact is that the ONLY thing that connects modern homo sapiens (let's say 'man') to man at the time of the ice samples that he is studying is sex. Cave men and women of 100,000 years ago could have had a series of sexual experiences almost identical to those of Matt and Lisa (minus the condom!). So in his personal life, Matt is taking the same journey back in time that he does in his work. Finally, it has grown emotionally too. For the most of the film, the notion that there is emotion in this relationship seems doubtful, but it is a tribute, most of all to the fabulous 'performance' of Margot Stilley that emotion does weave its way into this film 'by the back door' so to speak (no reference to the wonderful 'Last Tango in Paris' implied). Effectively, the latter half of the film can be seen as a kind of journey into a dark and uncertain corner of her psyche. (That, of course, is exactly what Last Tango is, in relation to the Brando character.) This is most clearly seen in the scene when she fantasises while being tied up. I cannot say that I have fully worked out where everything fits in - and I am notably ignorant of the type of music that they spend their non-bonking hours listening to. What I can say is that this film is, in parts, much more erotic than conventional pornography (not that I am an expert on that!), and infinitely more emotionally engaging. And finally... thank heavens that it doesn't take a didactic stand on their sexual antics. At the end, they split up, but there are no histrionics and neither is represented as having 'suffered' any more than the tinge of regret from the time they spent together. How refreshing.",9 Songs

It's explicit, upfront, even radical in its depiction, but never speculative - a typical Winterbottom film. What I like best about it is the interplay of the intimate bed scenes with the Antarctic footage and the (rousing) recordings of the concerts. It perfectly forges links from the physical, romantic joie de vrie to spirituality and human surroundings. Not recommended to the prudes, but to everyone else who enjoys cinema at its most intimate.",9 Songs
52,Mr_PCM,A simple but beautiful story of a relationship,8,23 February 2006,"9 songs is a beautiful film about the reality of a sexual relationship between two people. Interspersed with live footage from the couple's dates at various gigs, we see the natural progression of a relationship that many people will recognise all too well. Filmed in a semi-documentary style, we see a young couple, Matt and Lisa, in the course of their relationship over a year, and we are treated to see all the intimate moments and incidental moments that make up a relationship, both good and bad.The film was groundbreaking in that it truly tested the censors; it features the most explicit sex scenes ever seen in a cinema-released film. This inevitably led to outrage and claims that it was pornographic. However, while the film does go further than any other mainstream film in its depiction of sex, including shots of penetration and ejaculation, it is done in a real and honest way, a feeling that is absent from pornography. It is not intended to be arousing or erotic but just real, and shows that sex is a natural and everyday thing – although people don't talk about it, many still do it. 9 Songs serves only to show the natural reality of a relationship, without any holding back. While many may feel the nudity is gratuitous, for the point that director Michael Winterbottom was trying to make, the nudity was necessary to achieve the almost documentary feel.Borders have slowly but continually been pushed back in terms of what can be shown on screen; films such as Romance, Intimacy, The Idiots, The Pornographer and Baise-Moi have also tested the censors. 9 Songs feels like the natural progression from these films. Obviously the question that will always be raised is 'where does art become pornography'? Or equally 'how legal is censorship?' But these are not questions that this review will even attempt to answer.The reason the film is so effective is because it is so honest in its portrayal of a relationship - the couple are perfectly at ease with each other, and this is how a film like this should come across. It's not just the explicitness of the sex scenes, but all the little things as well that make the film an effective essay on a simple relationship. For example, after sex, instead of straightaway reaching for clothes to cover themselves up, Lisa thinks nothing of just walking to the kitchen naked to make a cup of coffee or whatever. They are perfectly happy being in their flat naked together without having sex. Their conversations are the normal mundane chatter between couples. The going to gigs together is just something they share - relationships aren't just based upon being immensely attracted to each other and having sex and romantic meetings together. The relationship is also based on a friendship and shared interests, things they enjoy doing together and this is what is seen in the film.Its this realism that makes the film so effective, and sets it apart from other films - how many Hollywood films do you see where after a sex scene they both immediately feel the need to cover up from each other? How often do they talk about the most mundane everyday things, or get up and, without bothering to get dressed, go to the kitchen to make coffee? If you are easily offended by images of a sexual nature, then obviously don't even think about going to see this film. But then again, people like that would probably not even be reading this review. But the film is a fascinating essay on the simplicity and complexity of any relationship; it does not comment or judge, it just shows. The characters are not judged or given any development, they are just there.Anyone who has ever been in a relationship will recognise at least elements of Lisa and Matt's relationship in their own, and it is this recognition of familiarity and reality that make this such a simple but beautifully effective film.Oh, and the gigs are great too, if you like that sort of thing.",9 Songs
53,JRmf,For those who like to watch...,6,23 September 2006,"This movie has copped a lot of flak for being meaningless, without plot or character development. For me the test of any movie is whether I got something out of it - entertainment, inspiration, information - and whether it sustained interest throughout or did I end up clock-watching. It passed the latter test - 9 songs was not boring at all - but I'm still trying to work out what I got from the movie, which is essentially an ultra-graphic, nothing-at-all-left-to-the imagination account of the sexual intimacies of Matt (Kieran O'Brien) and Lisa (Margo Stilley), interspersed with brief rock concert segments.Despite the film's title, there are 15 songs credited. These are present, it would seem, only to provide relief from the full-on sexual encounters which are the main business of the film. ""Games couples play"" would have been a more apt title. Conversation tends to be trivial at best, and the brief glimpses into Matt's job as a glaciologist (Lisa is a student) provide only a scant background to him or to the film. So Matt and Lisa have sex, snort coke, attend a rock concert, go back to his place and have more sex, and so on through the film. The sex is varied - traditional and oral-genital (both cunnilingus and fellatio), and involves mild bondage. I don't recall seeing anything resembling sodomy. There is a progression in sex acts, beginning with the traditional missionary position (vigorously enacted) and cunnilingus following on through mild bondage, very explicit fellatio plus ejaculation and climaxing (sorry) with Lisa riding Matt with extreme penetration.Matt is clearly smitten with Lisa - he describes her as young, careless and ""very beautiful"". I'd have to differ - like almost any young girl she _is_ pretty, but not voluptuous, thin to the point of being anorexic but with a nice butt and legs - she wonders if she looks too boyish. Her breasts are small and flat but with mature, obviously adult nipples. Her genital region is well developed. Matt remembers her fondly - ""her taste, her smell"". For his part, Matt is gentle but quite willing and capable in fulfilling his role in pleasuring Lisa. One suspects his manhood would be the envy of most men and in one scene it is shown ejaculating.Lisa doesn't express any special fondness for Matt, though he is a friend and she gives him a nice book (along with more sex) on the Antartic for his birthday. She simply enjoys being f*cked - often and hard - and having orgasms, including masturbation with a vibrator. Matt provides the means, and she is after all giving him what most men crave - a willing, eager female.It's notable that 9 Songs is the first listing in Margo's filmography whereas Keiren is an experienced actor. Much, if not all of the sex appears real, not simulated (in marked contrast to the traditional justification for sex scenes), so one can form one's own conclusions as to why she undertook such a role and how she coped with this most intrusive aspect. Whatever, one hell of a way to start a career (she has several subsequent appearances listed).After some 2400 votes, the film has averaged a mere 5/10 (I gave it a 6). Voting patterns suggest women may have liked the film slightly more than men. Michael Winterbottom is an accomplished director with several significant works in the more thoughtful mold. So what was his intention? Certainly 9 Songs is well crafted, well paced & varied and not too long with (arguably) compelling subject matter. As many have pointed out (and as anyone would know who has seen a porn film), this film is not simply pornographic - it is at once too bland and carefully structured.Both parties get to dominate and lead but Lisa is clearly in control: Matt must wear a condom (despite his desire not to), the sex is always at his place (only once at the end does he visit hers), and it's she who finally terminates the relationship by leaving him and returning to America. Lisa spends a lot of the time on her back but in a final scene with Matt bare-chested, tied to the bed head and she in boots (and fully clad in a sex scene for once), the real relationship is depicted. Her spiked heel is on his chest, her foot is on his head...Some see the film simply as typical of what couples do when they first fall in love - perhaps this is also fair comment. But given Michael's track record for the off-beat, perhaps he simply made this film due to the Everest factor: Not been done before, now it has, and bugger what the world thinks. Oh yes, sex sells. Anyway watch and see...",9 Songs

If you want pornography - especially in this day and age - then why not get the real thing? The plot is nonsense, just a man who's met a woman and they're both obsessed with sex; they go to gigs at the Brixton Academy.

55,cwarne_uk,Best watched Alone In 5 Minute Bursts,3,5 September 2008,"Contrary to the rubbish spouted by many real sex has been a feature of films almost since the medium was invented. The pornography industry packages it's sex in flimsy plots and bad acting, knowing that the potential audience is little interested in them. With ""9 Songs"" Michael Winterbottom has made a film that has all of the three features of classic pornography - a plot that is so thin it constantly threatens to disappear, acting (and improvisation) of a truly laughable nature (this is not the sort of film that actors with talent or a reputation would appear in), and plenty of uns(t)imulated coupling. Does that make it pornography? Probably not since porn is made with the honest and (dis)reputable intent of getting it's male audience to exercise their right hands, whereas the intent of Winterbottom's mess is anybody's guess. The rash of supposed ""art"" films with explicit sex is well known over recent years. Filmmakers will witter on about reality and honesty but I suspect the old adage that sex sells is more applicable. Almost without exception the films have been pretty dire (a lot of uber-pretentious French twaddle comes to mind) and ""9 Songs"" is no exception. Much like violence, hardcore sex in films is done best by the exploitation industry, they at least have an honest attitude to their product.",9 Songs
56,bastard_wisher,"A stunning, if slightly limited portrait of a young couple in love",10,24 November 2005,"Generally speaking, i get the impression that this film isn't being very well-received. I can understand why that is, but i can't say that i agree with it myself. It seems that the frank depiction of sexuality in films always alienates a certain percentage of the audience, for moral reasons and also because it isn't the prevalent cultural sensibility. I for one, thought the film was great. Honestly, i don't understand how anyone who's ever been in love, or even ever wanted to be in love can't enjoy this film. This film is a depiction of being in love, no more and no less. Never before have i ever this situation portrayed in such an intimate, pure way. This is like the climactic scene of ""The Brown Bunny"" extended into an entire film. Not (only) because of the use of explicit, real sex, but because of the sense of true intimacy the film creates. Possibly more accurately, this film is like the last scene of ""Irreversible"" extended into an entire film. Or even the most romantic scenes of ""All the Real Girls"". In any case, you get my point. I've always thought that Michael Winterbottom was very good at this particular aspect in his film making, as far back as ""Wonderland"" and certainly in the otherwise mediocre ""Code 46"". Here, he finally gets the masterpiece he deserves.That said, i don't think the film is quite completely perfect. Especially considering the brief 70-minute running time, i think they could have afforded to stretch out the film a bit. I found it rather frustrating that some amazing, beautiful scenes of the couple simply being together, non-sexually, would be cut short to make way for another sex scene or more concert footage. I can appreciate Winterbottom's idea of telling a love story exclusively through sex, but i think ultimately it was somewhat limiting. The film could have easily been anywhere from 20 to 50 minutes longer, and i think it should have been, if those scenes showed the couple being together in non-sexual situations. As it stands, the film is an incredible, poetic portrait of two young people in love, but i think it could have gone even farther. The film contains such profound moments of truth (thanks in no small part to the amazing, improvised performances of the two leads), that i think it's slightly disappointing not to have shown more aspects of their relationship beyond the bedroom.",9 Songs
57,pressboard,We needed more of a climax,6,4 August 2005,"My only real complaint was Margo Stilley's character. Her performance was pretty undefined. This may have been more a result of the lack of a script than her performance. Kieran O'Brien's character is fleshed out with a voice-over narrative and scenes from his job as an arctic researcher. The only thing learned about Stilley's character is that she is 21, reckless and on prescription medications - they are both snorting cocaine. We know she is unstable because of her behavior, but there is no real chance to either like or dislike her. I blame this on Winterbottom who should have given her character more defining dialog. The sex is a cross between soft core and hardcore (not hard and fast definitions)and is just barely erotic. My wife and I both complained that Kieran goes down on her about 4 times compared to her going down on him once. This should have been more balanced. There are 9 concerts punctuating the eating and f**king and after a while we were counting to determine when the last one would happen.

58,SONNYK_USA,Possible the first pornographic 'date movie' that lacks the hardcore edge guys expect but does take mainstream ADULT movies to the next level - REAL sex!,7,25 August 2005,"How does a modern man recall his last 'love' relationship? In this case, by the songs they shared together. The man in question is a glaciologist who's airborne research over Antarctica spurs a chronological series of memories broken up by nine LIVE concert segments. To sum up the simplistic plot line of the flashbacks, the two young lovers meet at a rock concert and then each major sex scene at their Islington flat is punctuated with brief concert segments (shot guerrilla-style with the couple in attendance).Director Michael Winterbottom (""24 Hour Party People"") has actually done Hollywood (and Planned Parenthood) a service by taking out the 'fake' lovemaking scenes audiences have grown accustomed to and replaced them with REAL sex, actual condoms IN USE, and a female (or male) orgasm that hasn't been staged for dramatic effect.Seriously, the porn industry should take note if this film has any commercial success in the USA, because for my money I'd rather have my human sexuality nicely photographed, lit well, and true-to-life than filled with emotionally forced bad acting, flat lighting, and fake orgasms (with even faker breasts). Name one porn movie with fantastic helicopter shots of Antarctica's icy surface with a science lesson tossed in too. Nada.Best of all are the honest, first-rate acting performances from both Brit acting veteran Kieran O'Brian (""24 Hour Party People"") as 'Matt', the very lucky older guy (age 31), and 'Lisa' (Margo Stilley), the young American waif, who gets picked up at a rock concert one night at London's Brixton Academy.In England, where this film has already been released there was quite a brouhaha as first-time movie actress Margo Stilley (age 21) supposedly tried to have her name removed from the credits. Luckily, the scathing reviews by the British press have worn off and the film is being released in the USA with Margo credited and NO NC-17 rating.Although a first-time principle actress, Margo's performance is noteworthy in that her improvised dialogue not only rings true but it speaks to the neuroses of many young 'wild' females way beyond the Paris Hilton experience. She even creates a little comic relief when confronting her 'boyness' in the bathroom mirror.In retrospect, I don't think this film has the artistic merit of last year's ode to eroticism (Bertolucci's ""The Dreamers""), but director Michael Winterbottom does make a compelling argument for taking sex scenes to their natural conclusion. Adult audiences are gravitating more and more to NC-17 rated movies (re: ""The Brown Bunny,"" etc.) and it may be time for local cinemas (and Hollywood) to grow up. Hey, if Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt really are lovers then why couldn't they have 'condom sex' on screen for a change, and how much more of an impact would that have on college-age adults practicing 'unsafe' sex than thousands of hours of PSA's and sex-ed classes! Even if sex on the big screen isn't your thing, this film is so pure in its intentions it's practically a 'date movie' (except blind dates). Even the ladies will enjoy the sensitive approach to the material as the sexual exploits build from cunnilingus to some mild S&M, eventually progressing to the de rigeur 'cum shot'. As I said, it's an ADULTS ONLY experience, but one that might rekindle the sexual romance in your own relationships and give you a forum to converse with your partner about a sensitive subject (in America anyway).",9 Songs

This is not because I'm a prude who can't handle the prospect of viewing frank depictions of sexuality. I didn't have to endure a strict religious upbringing anymore than I hold conservative political views. But, before I get to why this production doesn't sit well with me, I should probably cover this inordinately sparse effort, by Michael Winterbottom, to at least some extent. I get what high art films are striving for. They want to capture every nuance of a character, from the seriocomic aspects, to the overly dramatic beats and down to the base carnality that holds space in most of our lives. In all honesty, the only difference between a mainstream film and an art house production is that art films seem to strive far closer to 100% authenticity with their portrayals of sexuality and physical intimacy. This being said, ""9 Songs"" is not art. It's porn. Allow me to explain.""Ken Park"", Irreversible"" and ""The Brown Bunny"" are more focused on scenes devoted to character development that, on occasion, are crowned by instances of graphic (mostly simulated, but occasionally explicit) sexuality. ""9 Songs"" goes the other route and features explicit content that, on occasion, is crowned by a threadbare plot. Over a 71 minute running time, Matt (Kieran O'Brien) and Lisa (Margo Stilley) have sex, indulge in a little recreational drug use, go to a concert and repeat. Some folks with a penchant for intellectually smug, masturbatory jargon, to explain away the bulge in their pants, may state otherwise. But, as someone who has sat through this film more than once, there really is nothing else to the proceedings. Since this was dominated by sex, let's talk about it. Nothing was filmed well enough to be titillating or disturbing. It was just there and the two actors involved were, simply put, not cut out for it. This last bit pains me, because they put everything on the line for this production. But, despite the sacrifices they made, it still isn't any good. ""9 Songs"" spends far too little time on character development and too much in the bedroom. So, if you want to see an adult film with noble aspirations, this is it. But, then again, you could save yourself the effort and just surf the adult web. Hey, it's only two or three mouse clicks away from this review.Now I'll get to why this movie disgusts me so. I imagine the two leads were told ""9 Songs"" was going to be a groundbreaking, genre redefining hit with the indie crowd that would open doors and launch their careers. Well, seven years later, that's yet to happen. Based off the info derived from IMDb, I'd say this flick only served to slam doors in their faces hard enough to knock them on their asses. And the phenomena isn't relegated to just this film. The overwhelming majority of the cast of 2002's ""Ken Park"" was never seen on screen again. The leads in 2006's ""Shortbus"" largely disappeared and one nearly lost her day job. I think it's profoundly wrong to prey on the masses of struggling, hand to mouth actors to populate a film that will most likely hurt their acting prospects and shrink their non-showbiz opportunities as well.Directors like Michael Winterbottom should stop kidding themselves and be honest about what they're doing when they set out to craft a film like this. They need to be especially honest about the damage it can wreak on their actors. Deep down they have to know this, since they will never try to snag A-list talent. This is why I say, for the next high art film, when the writer/director is looking to cast, he/she should seriously consider the adult film industry. Adult film performers are comfortable in front of a camera and, with direction, can act well enough. ""Baise Moi"" serves as a prime example of how such a film can benefit from their participation. For a mainstream example, look at Sasha Grey in ""Entourage"". She's an adult film actress, and, while nowhere near being in the same league as an Oscar contender, the lady gets the job done. What it all boils down to is the explicit sex, since this is going to be more powerful than any dialogue, comedic or action heavy scene could ever hope to be. Two struggling actors conned into having sex on screen are going to be horrendously (prom night level) awkward. Worst of all, depending on your gender, persuasion and taste, they may not be the kind of people you'd ever want to think about in a sexual context to begin with. But, with adult film actors, this wouldn't be a concern. For one, they're usually models. Also, they're used to going to these private places, on camera, and have enough confidence with their bodies to lend these scenes the kind of charisma needed when filming explicit material. Best of all, it would do nothing to harm them in the long run. If anything, it would show them to be more versatile than just randomly lamenting to the tune of ""oh yeah, oh yeah"". It would be a win-win for all parties, right? At the end of the day, I'm just a straight dude, living in the 21st century, who blogs on the net every so often. So, obviously, I'm not terribly opposed to viewing risqué, explicit or hardcore content. I just don't want to see anymore fledgling actors and actresses exploited to their detriment for films that, like ""9 Songs"", are nowhere near being worthy of their sacrifice. Because to use someone's dreams and aspirations to, ultimately, victimize them feels deeply wrong.",9 Songs
60,hjames-97822,Pornographic junk simple as that,1,5 April 2015,"There's one thing you can say for good, professional pornography. It's honest. It doesn't pretend to be art and most of the people making good porn know what they are doing and know their audience.This film is amateurish pornography parading as an art film. It succeeds at neither, but it did effectively ruin Ms. Stilley's career. (This was her first effort on film.) Basically this is one sex scene after another strung together with some very loud dated rock concert footage. The wine and cheese crowd will try and find some meaning in this thing. There just isn't any. All--every single one--of the sexual scenes is real. The film is unrated. The British censors gave it a certificate because they said it was vulgar but not obscene. I agree.There are very few sex acts you will not see and in close up with these two actors who claimed (of course) that it was all for art. They were testing themselves, they were pushing limits, they were all professionals and on and one. They are unable to simply say they had sex on film for money. O'Brien was 31 and she was 21 and a new actress. Why she let herself get conned into this role is a mystery.While the two actors claimed they really, really wanted to test their limits, it turns out they had limits after all. The director wrote a scene in which Mr. O'Brien would have graphic gay sex with another male. He admits he decided he wasn't ready to get that artistic. You will also see Mr. O'Brien have a real orgasm in some detail assisted by Ms. Stilley. She however, declined to consume his bodily fluids as was suggested.As Mr. O'Brien said in an interview, ""It's just sex."" And bad sex at that.",9 Songs

I found the film rather clumsy to be honest - the Antartica metaphor was rather too tacked on. It wasn't clear that Matt's job is something to do with Antartica, and the comment that ""in the open sea, icebergs melt"" was a rather heavy way of expressing what is now practically a cliché: that relationships flounder when they have to deal with 'real life' and it's a lot easier when you create your own intimate space. And the film lets us into the couple's space, but in a very unadventurous way, which is disappointing when compared to Wonderland or Butterfly Kiss. The woman is narrated by the man and is primarily an object of his gaze (especially in the masturbation scene). It's the woman as the white continent: unexplored, and unknowable, even if we do get the odd up the vagina shot. Freud himself could have made this film!! The soundtrack is fantastic though, and the Primals really are just fab. Bobby Gillespie is a rock god. Shame that the film doesn't go as deep as the main character's member.",9 Songs

Then you are all set for your sexual activity, which like I just described seems like you're going to kill someone. And maybe this movie is trying to say it out loud: ""sex isn't a mortal crime and you're not going to rotten in hell and having your genitals pierced and speared by sadistic demons forever"". That's how a Korean girl pictured it on YouTube (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRzFIBXIUg8) because you had sex, lost of it. But, the thing is, sex can really be a passport to heaven or hell mostly in your mind than on your body and I mean it in a not religious context. Irresponsible sex can also screw you and your partner in a non pleasant way, physically!! Let's remind people that STD like AIDS has not stopped. In addition, it is very likely that a couple, especially married couple, will have issues in their relationship if the sex life is dull. We can look at it in many angles other than just preaching about what you see. Funny that ""how you SEE it"" makes the whole difference because a blind person would never that judgmental approach!! Anyway, try to be open to what that really means even if you just watch the trailer. have your own opinion and think that sex for sex, without love, will always be just sex, and that is usually dull over time.",9 Songs

It's basically Mumblecore with sex. However, unlike your average Mumblecore film which insists on exposing us to the most boring people on the planet, doing the most boring things, at least Winterbottom had the common courtesy to give us some titillating scenes. The rock concert scenes are poorly shot, on video, with no close-ups, and if you're not familiar with the bands, they grow tiresome quite quickly. There doesn't appear to be any real message or point to the film, and if there is, it's well hidden. Without offering any spoilers, here's the movie in a nutshell. Videotaped shot of a rock band performing a song at a live venue where the camera is about 100 yards away. Cut to the couple having sex.

By contrast in 'Ai No Corrida', from which Winterbottom certainly takes inspiration, the sex scenes manage to tell a story and help us understand the desperation and doomed nature of the couple in question.

66,uroskin,9 loves,3,23 July 2007,"Rialto Channel featured a quite graphic sex film last night called 9 Songs. Ostensibly it was a concert film of some trendy (in 2004 at least) British bands playing live in a few London venues, attended by the film protagonists: a skinny waif (Margo Stilley) and hunk (Kieran O'Brien). Between songs, they make very explicit love in all sorts of scenarios to make it look less boring. The dialog is rather inane as befits a sex film (""Do I look like a boy"", she purrs while she arches her body into even greater skinniness and lack of breasts. ""Yes"" he says, but we groan: ""Oh no she doesn't, she looks like a transsexual who forgot to take her hormone pills."") Lest any feminists berate this film as sick porno, to the contrary, she treats him mostly like a piece of meat - and what a succulent piece of meat Kieran's was too. Instead, imagine or remember, if you will, one of the sex scenes: he's cooking dinner and she is pleasuring herself with a whirring vibrator. He goes into the bedroom and looks at her doing her thing. She orgasms noisily and lengthily, and he just goes back to his cooking. If the roles had been reversed there would be howls of outrage, screams of objectification, calls for bans on the film.In all, not a great riveting story, more constructed like what you would remember after a nine session affair. It's fun to construct your own story in the film because there is very little explicit going on story-wise. My theory is that the film is actually about the revelation of the phallus. Kieran's penis is the hero of the film and gradually has a more and more explicit presence in the film. Unlike a real porn movie, his penis is playing hide and seek in chiaroscuro lighting early on and only comes to prominence in the final love making scenes. With a spectacular ejaculation in the final round. There the film ended because there was literally no more to reveal or for us to discover (I'd have had a go at his hole too if I had been the director, because that is the final frontier of manhood). Kieran O'Brien has a great future in porno if he wants to avoid being an unemployed actor. He leaves those Hollywood bad boys and amateur porn stars like Colin Farrell for dead.",9 Songs
67,jack_malvern,Is it porn? Yes. Here's why.,6,2 February 2005,"It is high-concept, art-house, and even watchable, but it is still pornography.The definition of pornography (which I checked as soon as I got home, having left the cinema without looking anyone in the eye) is something along the lines of ""sexual images created for erotic rather than aesthetic pleasure"". Michael Winterbottom might argue that his intentions - to tell the story of a relationship through sex - were aesthetic, but there are three problems with this.First, the images were unquestionably titillating. (Other reviewers' protestations that there is no erotica tells you more about them than about the film.) Second, most of the sex scenes were interchangeable. Some were appropriate to the stage of relationship at which they were shown, but most were not.Third, the ""money shot"" did not enhance the story. It was baldly gratuitous, and served only to show how far Winterbottom was willing to go.I don't have a problem with pornography, but to claim 9 Songs is not, merely because it has characters and a story (of sorts) is disingenuous.",9 Songs
68,chucknorrisrules,Nine songs somehow does it!,6,7 July 2009,"Someone once told me that there are three basic elements to any storyline. 1, put a man up a tree, 2, throw rocks at him, 3, bring the man back down again. Or not because he dies. Or make him a woman who throws rocks back. Or whatever. But that storyline applies to anything, be it film, books, TV, stage, comics, etc.Nine songs doesn't do this. Nine songs focuses simply on two people, a geographical expert on the antarctic in his early 30s, and a 21 year old college student. All they seem to do is talk, have fun, go to concerts and clubs, and of course, screw like randy lapins*! In fact, the sex is what seems to make up a great deal of the relationship - indeed half the film (the other half populated by songs performed in English concerts in and near London), and the fact that the characters have sex explicitly and graphically for real with several close ups on their anatomies makes one wonder whether it's just a porn show with music and no story. Apart from one small argument, there are no angry and tearful rows, next to no drama, and nobody goes up a tree to even have the rocks thrown at them.However, the bizarre thing about 9 songs is that it pulls all of this off, and that's what makes it good! It makes the characters so simple and easy to identify with through its total honesty. Some people may find this boring, but 9 songs is probably not for everybody, but don't dodge it just because it has explicit real sex in it (if the coke-snorting in it was real, then that really WOULD be a scandal). Give the film a try, and who knows, you might quite like it! * Lapin is Latin for rabbit, for those who are not smarmy literary numpties.",9 Songs
69,kasserine,"Sex, Drugs, Rock and Roll Equals Boredom?",4,12 September 2005,"9 Songs, a film by Michael Winterbottom, the director of 24 Hour Party People, centers around a glaciologist who, while doing research in the Antarctica, reflects on a girlfriend he once had.The film is structured between rock concert footage of such bands as the Von Bondies and the Dandy Warhols, amongst others, and sexually charged scenes of the couple with the occasional voice-over of the boyfriend as he works in the Antarctic.So what could be wrong with combining some rock songs with some explicit sex scenes? I suppose nothing or everything depending on the result. Unfortunately, the result in 9 Songs is boredom. I think if the film was a rock video, it would have worked. However, the film has much higher aspirations and, to be sure, some of the scenes with the couple are interesting, and occasionally even titillating, but those moments are few and far between. The cut-aways to the boyfriend in the Antarctica are unintentionally comical. There was more then one person in the theater that chuckled out loud. The film clocks in at a mere 69 minutes, so it's a pretty big failing on its part to wear down an audience in such a short time. While the scenes with the couple are wearing, the concert footage, on the other hand if fairly compelling with decent, albeit grainy, footage and contain some pretty good song selections. I'm not familiar enough with the songs to be able to discern how the various selections fit into the film and while the footage is okay, the audio is fuzzy enough that I couldn't always make out the words. This isn't meant as a concert film though, it's a film about human relationships, this young couple in particular. And it is here where the film really breaks down.Unfortunately, nothing really happens with them. The relationship flashbacks seemingly follow a chronological order. The couple, Matt and Lisa, meet at the first song(concert) fall into bed and through the ensuing scenes, in between the back and forth with the songs, we see glimpses of arguments, mundane conversations, and lots and lots of naturalistic sex. Yep, it's true. The two actors are actually doing it. The sex gets increasingly graphic and there does appear to be a design to the encounters, however with such a vague narrative, the repetition of the encounters does little to advance any semblance of an aesthetic purpose.Oddly, as I watched 9 Songs, I kept thinking of film school. I think if the film were a final project of some sincere, albeit pretentious, film student, it would make more sense. I could appreciate a students failed attempt at making a statement on the human condition. But this isn't some twenty-something's immature opus with years ahead to grow within the learning curve, it's established filmmaker Michael Winterbottom's film and I paid $9.50 to see it. So, shelling out money to see his vague art project I find myself much less forgiving.A film must do something no matter how vague the narrative is. If its sole aim is to be entertaining, does it succeed? Is the horror movie scary? Is the action film thrilling? If it's goal is something grander, as in an art house film, does it express something about the human condition? Naturally, the same rules apply to soft-core porn and hardcore porn. Is it sensual and graphic respectively?Herein lies the problem with 9 songs. My feeling is that it pretends towards art, but since it never really says anything, for me, it shifted over to soft-core porn, but is a touch too graphic and labored for that genre. And, it just isn't graphic enough and direct to be hardcore. So, 9 songs doesn't really work. At least if it was porn, there would be something to get excited about.",9 Songs

73,shaneo632,"Brave attempt, but ultimately soulless...(MILD spoilers)",5,4 December 2007,"Shaun Munro's Reviews (ShaunMunro.co.uk):Michael Winterbottom's 9 Songs is a sexual experience from near enough its first frame. The film's premise is incredibly straightforward  Matt (Kieran O'Brien) and Lisa (Margo Stilley) meet at a concert, and 9 Songs is essentially an expression of their love story, which just so happens to rather loosely revolve around music.From the outset, we must consider where the line between glamourised pornography and artistic sexual expression is drawn, and furthermore, whether Winterbottom's film is able to transcend this line. A number of the film's sex scenes are unsimulated, which has been a high point of contention for the filmmakers actually attempting to tender a release for the film. Genitals, both male and female, are in full display, and while it is in a sense refreshing, the film is sure to alienate and embarrass the more body-conscious viewers among us.Initially, 9 Songs appears to follow the format of a presentation of seemingly sage information about Matt's expedition to Antarctica, followed by a scene of intense intimacy, followed again by a musical interlude. Given the repetition and questionable narrative structure of the film, one can understand the criticism leveled against it almost immediately.The film at points appears to settle down, yet just as an interesting or thoughtful strand of dialogue appears to emerge, it transpires into a sex session. It is difficult to know what the director is trying to say, that is, if he is trying to say anything at all.Despite my outward criticisms, I must defend the film largely against accusations of it being extremely pornographic  it rarely shows direct penetration and is mostly inferred. As such, the film may be a loosely strung together concertina of sex scenes, but porn it is not.In lieu of all of this sex and debauchery, the film at least posits the idea of safe sexual interaction, and whilst a pack of Durex are hard to come by in 9 Songs, in one instance, a condom is clearly, visibly in use.By the time the fourth song booms out and we're dropped back into the Brixton Academy once again, I was beginning to wonder  is this a music festival? Are they going to a concert every night? Are the 9 songs metaphors for something? Unfortunately, the explanation is nowhere near as interesting as the latter question, but it did make me wonder  are these people loaded? A very curious lesbian-esquire conflict is introduced in the latter stages of the film  it appears to be an attempt to inject emotion into our hedonistic characters. However, considering we feel little-to-nothing for these individuals due to their distinct lack of characterisation (in that all we ever see is them having sex), this attempt ultimately fails.The gravity of the conflict between Matt and Lisa is expressed through the symbolic meaning of the songs, or rather, the act of going to the concert. Matt, in his next visit to the Academy, attends alone  he is on a whole over wavelength, listening to an completely different song, if you will, and whether this is reflective of a culture clash or something else entirely different, is anyone's guess. We are also quickly shown a bottle of pills, but its significance is up for debate  we learn who they belong to, but nothing else. There are subtle hints as to who may be suffering from what, but they are exactly that  very subtle, and nothing more than hints.There is one portion of 9 Songs that I find incredibly difficult to defend  Lisa administers oral sex to Matt in rather unflattering close-up, which I didn't personally object to, but, in what is the most critically reviled and shocking portion of the film, Matt is shown ejaculating. It just feels unnecessary  the slurping noises are vile in particular, yet no more disturbing than the fact that we can hear children playing outside, presumably mere feet away.Only in the final sex scene is the viewer able to extricate any definitive, emotive meaning, yet once again, we are barely familiarised enough with these characters beyond their acts of chemical exchange, and so an attempt at causing us to feel anything simply appears forced. The manner in which the film ends, whilst certainly not particularly unique or interesting, was a smart move, considering the temptation that must have lingered to pile on sentiment and clichés. In this respect, in the only manner in which it can be asserted, 9 Songs is a restrained picture.The ambiguity of the fate of Matt and Lisa's relationship is an interesting point on which the film ends  the director chooses not to romanticise or force-feed his creation or his audience with even a hint of a slant in either direction, deftly reflecting the fickleness of relationships and the meticulousness with which they must be preened.9 Songs, as an experimental film, is an interesting exercise, yet it is difficult to consider it a success when everything outside of the sex scenes is either dull, pointless, emotionally corrupt or all of the above. The film should be commended for its daring attempt at capturing raw, gritty, penetrative sex onto celluloid, yet we are overexposed to these moments at the detriment of the film's effectiveness. Winterbottom shows us more than is necessary to convey the love and affection felt between these characters, and accompanies these moments with musical interludes that appear to have little significance symbolically, thematically, or otherwise. I cannot bring myself to condemn Winterbottom, because the film is not without its meritorious moments, yet at the same time, one cannot consider 9 Songs to effectively traverse the line of glorified pornography, so much as it narrowly scrapes past it.",9 Songs
74,MetalMiike,Pointless Artless Sexless,1,5 September 2006,"It is hardly necessary to describe the plot; Boy (a geologist... glaciologist... something like that...) meets girl and together they proceed to visit various concerts and have some of the dullest sex (real or otherwise) committed to film. And sometimes they talk rubbish.Actually, the sex might not be that dull, it's hard to judge; such was the hype about this film when it came out. I think what disappoints the most is that it is so downright normal. Personally, my main gripe about the film is that it has no story, no purpose, other than to dare to show real sex scenes in a mainstream context. It left the viewing public, the BBFC and the Daily Mail saying ""so what?"" It advertises itself as being shocking and controversial but it is none of these. If a film's whole existence is to trace a relationship between two people, possibly the least interesting aspect of it is what they do in bed and if the film's purpose was to show sex, why do it in such a mundane way? Some reviewers mention that it shows sex from a female perspective, but that is patronising. Certainly, all the women I know who saw it had a hard time not staying awake. Most didn't even get to the end.Ultimately, there is no point to this film whatsoever; why couldn't Winterbottom have made a film, say, about a straight character who becomes attracted to someone of the same sex, or an otherwise average person who became attracted to S+M? Then the motivation to show genuine sex scenes would have been valid, perhaps. As it is, the most daring thing we have here is... well, I can't think of anything. Guess what adjective can be used to describe a film about two boring people who are boring in bed and listen to boring music and are otherwise boring? From what Margo Stilley has said about her role in the film, she did it possibly to defy convention (she is from the bible belt). Winterbottom did it perhaps to bring a new level of reality to the screen (only it has been done before and a lot better) but only turns out a film that is... boring... and as for O'Brien, I fall asleep just looking at him.Overall, utterly pointless, completely unimpressive and why anyone bothered is beyond me. Did I mention it was boring?",9 Songs
75,jim-314,rockin' love,9,28 December 2005,"Michael Winterbottom seems incapable of making an uninteresting film. Every time I see another of his movies (Jude, The Claim, Wonderland, Welcome to Sarajevo, 24 Hour Party People) I am surprised and delighted by having been given a glimpse into human behavior that has made me look a little more closely and a little more sympathetically than I might have otherwise. This is as true for Nine Songs as for any other movie I've seen by him. In this case, however, one can hardly view the movie without responding as well to the critical turmoil which has surrounded it. The movie is sexually explicit. In bits and pieces, it's fully as explicit as a pornographic film. For this reason, many critics and viewers seem compelled to distance themselves from it, most often by declaring themselves bored. It's an interesting position, considering how few people are, in fact, bored by sexually explicit material, and how many fascinated by it (e.g., witness the health of the pornography industry). I'm tempted to believe that these people are either misrepresenting their interest for fear of how they might be judged, or so focused on the movie's sexual acts alone that they miss the role of those acts (and their sheer beauty) in the context of the rest of the film. In any event, the movie is a romance that, like most of the romances in most of our lives, includes a sexual component. In this respect, it's useful to view the film in comparison to deliberately pornographic films and to mainstream movie romances. Such a comparison would show that Nine Songs resembles neither genre. While it is as explicit in places as conventional pornographic films, it has nothing of the look or atmosphere of those films, and is completely different from them in type of script, character development, personal interactions, aesthetic attitude, and acting style. However, it also bears little resemblance to a conventional mainstream movie romance. There's little explicit conflict, no melodrama, and none of the usual road-blocks to a conventional boy-gets-girl fadeout. Here, boy gets girl, boy loses girl (or is it t'other way 'round?), and what comes in between describes the emotional arc of the relationship. That description of an evolving emotional relationship is more poetic (by which I mean, conveyed through images of varying degrees of trust and togetherness) than dramatic (conveyed through explicit conflicts and plot events). The movie is composed almost entirely of three types of scenes which roughly alternate through the movie: concert scenes attended by the couple, sex scenes, and domestic scenes (eating, dressing, or preparing meals). Together, the three alternating contexts chart the changing emotional weather of the relationship. In addition, the concert scenes provide a kind of aesthetic correlate to the sex scenes. By juxtaposing the concerts and the sex, Winterbottom makes even more explicit than usual the metaphor of music (especially rock and roll) for sex: a sweaty, rhythmic, consciousness-submerging sense-experience in both cases. At the same time, the lyrics of the songs provide a kind of Brechtian commentary on the state of the relationship. Both the major actors are immensely attractive and sexy, without looking like the gender parodies of porn films, nor like the pretty-bunnies of Hollywood romance. They're both beautiful, but they also seem real in a way that rarely occurs in either mainstream romances or in porn films. Perhaps because the characters seemed so believable to me, I for one found the end of the film seriously touching. Finally, I would advise readers not to believe those who say the sex is boring. The characters are believable, the actors are beautiful, and the sex is hot.",9 Songs
76,to_kill_better,Unpleasant couple listen to bad indie music and have sex,3,28 May 2008,"I bet that the assumption of most people reading these reviews is that if you're offended by sex, you'll hate the movie and if you're not, you'll like it. That assumption's not true in this case.I actually think that introducing realistic (or in this case, actual) sex into a mainstream love story is a pretty good idea. Why is that when we've voyeuristically watched a couple falling in love, there should still be a taboo on the sexual side of things? The problem here is that we haven't watched a couple fall in love. We've seen a pair of obnoxious metropolitan London stereotypes bump into each other at one of an increasingly irritating series of concerts by flavour-of-the-month indie bands. To be honest, I can't imagine a less lovable pair of characters and a less interesting set-up.There are a few interesting cinematic devices at work in the movie which temporarily make it interesting in an academic sense. The idea of the film as representative of the male character's fading memory of the short relationship (remembering the exciting bits - music, sex, arguments) is fairly novel and the modern updating of the classic French ""art house"" movie concepts of the 1970s (affluent couple struck by ennui meet for series of meaningless sexual encounters) is relatively astute. The main problem with all this technical, academic exercise is that there's no heart or soul to the movie and nothing to make the viewer actually want to keep watching unless they happen to be fans of the musical acts.The much publicised sex is actually quite inoffensive. There's no sexual violence or physically harmful practices which would justify the uproar surrounding this film. It's consentual sex between adults. Nothing that the majority of viewers wouldn't have tried out themselves.So you have a film that seems designed to shock or to be an exercise in experimental cinema. But the ""shocking"" sex is simply ordinary lovemaking, the music is forgettable bordering on awful and the characters aren't in any way engaging enough to carry a plot less film.Dull. 3/10",9 Songs

Instead build up to the intercourse.speaking of build up, actually establish how they met, establish some chemistry, even in a visual, subtle way. The film starts with BRMC concert footage where you barely glimpse the leads in the audience, then straight to them boinking in the next scene. Instead spend that first concert by visually showing us the steps of their meeting.record a whole song by each band, not just parts of songs. Use that time to really make artful concert segments, unique to each song and artist. And show something interesting actually happening with the characters during each one.shoot and light and pace the sex scenes in artful, meaningful ways. As they are in the film, it's basically uninteresting, badly lit shakycam porn.for the love of God, actually find two leads who are attractive and who can act.

78,maatmouse,A Michael Winterbottom curiosity,5,6 August 2005,"I came to this Michael Winterbottom film from one of his previous efforts starring Samantha Morton and Tim Robbins. I had never heard of him as a director and when Sight and Sound (the house magazine of the BFI) did an article on him I thought he was worthy of attention.Another reason for seeing this film was the promise of being able to watch a couple having actual sex and no merely faked orgasms and suggested oral sex either and no pornography. I quite wanted to be reminded of the reasons why two people can get together because of what they have in common.Winterbottom's film is not pornography at all. It is merely a study of a relationship seen through the context of real sex (what nearly all of us have experienced once we are a certain age (18+ usually) and are not bound by religious considerations ie the Catholic priesthood) and popular music. That's all. And the cast are two everyday folk. They are not artificially enhanced porn actors or glossed up dolls for the benefit of the viewer. It is a very much warts and all film, although I have much admiration for Winterbottom to persuade any actor to show the camera (and thus the audience) his real erection and later orgasm.Once the novelty of watching real adult sex wears off, however, there is little else left and that's the real disappointment of this film. Nevertheless it is an adult movie and some may enjoy it.",9 Songs

Apparently, it's the first film in British history to be released in the mainstream cinema with explicit sex. It would be nice to see the U.S. motion picture industry treat sex in a mature manner and encourage filmmakers to explore the topic in a mature and artistic manner. But that topic is for another day.Despite the controversy, this film was simply horrible. While the move had a lot of explicit sex, it had no story, plot or point. The entire film was about a man and a woman who have sex and go to 9 different rock concerts... THAT'S IT!!! No context whatsoever. Frankly, the concert footage of British bands like Franz Ferdinand and the Von Bondies was the only worthwhile and redeeming qualities of the film.",9 Songs
80,oslane,I think it would have been better without the concert footage,7,26 June 2008,"I hate to sound arty or pretentious for defending a movie that focuses so much of its time on actual, real explicit sex as many have debunked this as art house porn. But it's too easy to write this off as porn. First of all eroticism is in the eye of the beholder. If you're a Vivid addicted, Jenna Jameson watching porn person or into Cinemax soft core, this won't be your libido raiser. The girl is honestly quite pretty and criticizing her looks or, the male character's, is not only a cheap shot but echoes of what people were hoping to see in this movie.With that said, this is like many 'plot-less' movies. It's about human interaction in the moment.As a Michael Winterbottom fan, it's not my favorite by far. There's too much live rock footage linked to the drama, 9 performances to be exact, and honestly, I'm no indie rock fan. I wish Winterbottom could have extended the drama, thrown in a little more naturalistic comedy, such as in other films of his like '24 Hour Party People' or 'Tristram Shandy...', and developed his characters more.The trajectory of their relationship follows the typical excitement upon contact between two lovers, fighting, distancing, reconciliation and end pattern and it happens too quickly and mechanically.Otherwise, I thought it was a neat watch.",9 Songs

The only way this can have any depth is if you invent your own narrative out of whole cloth.Not that I'm faulting them for making it. Some scenes were kind of hot. It just failed to be anything more than music+sex, even when stretching for a meaningful existential connection to something.

82,whynot2,"Art Is Where You Find It, and Not Where You Don't Find It...",9,30 March 2006,"Recently, circumstance has resulted in (somewhat uncharacteristic) visits to a few art galleries, and I have been reminded that art can evoke a very strong response, even as it involves as static an exercise as looking at a painting or a sculpture. I would also observe forthrightly, that the reaction to any given piece, will vary in intensity and nature from one individual to another, and that there probably exist some individuals who do not experience much of a reaction at all.I finally found 9 Songs in a video sales outlet (the major rental chains near me don't carry it), and watched it one evening when I had the house to myself. I wanted to watch it because I am tend to be curious about what lies around the fringe; having watched it, I would say that it was highly effective in the same way as a resonant piece of art is. I won't be baited into a discussion as to whether it is 'art' or not; I simply state that it my experience watching this movie was similar to what I have experienced in galleries, a sort of, ""wow, what was that, why did it capture my thoughts as it did, and why did it affect my mood?"" 9 Songs certainly doesn't work like the movies that we're much more familiar with. There isn't a story per se; it doesn't attempt to charm through the use of wit or slapstick, there aren't wildly imaginative plot twists, it doesn't depend on the celebrity cache of the cast, and it's certainly doesn't depend on a plethora of unreasonably fiery explosions, caricature characters, and so on. However, my own experience is that it did an amazing job of conveying the mood, emotion, desire, and intensity of the early stages of a ultimately short term relationship between individuals at a stage of life and in a situation when all of those things are extremely important. The tension of desire and need between the two characters is palpable, I think as palpable as any portrayed anywhere.One probably can't consider 9 Songs without contemplating the question 'Is it porn?' 'Porn' is a term that has become so loaded as to cease to be useful. I am not put off by explicit depictions of sexuality, and 9 Songs certainly does depict sexuality explicitly. 9 Songs resembles what most of us commonly think of us 'porn' only to that extent. It doesn't look or sound like the broader base of porn: the bodies are refreshingly real, the settings realistic, the sounds of lovemaking muted, and the camera work all-encompassing but not acutely focused, all of which serves to differentiate 9 Songs from the vast bulk of that $2.6B to $3.9B (US) industry so many of us profess to hate.

Famous for its explicit sex scenes which are in fact hampered by the lack of any believable chemistry between the leads and the actresses' limited verbal repertoire of ""fuck me"" and ""faster, faster"".All well and good, but with no character development and scant plot, the sex is merely a freak show. Not the greatest acting, but I guess inevitable given the premise's impact on casting. This may of course account for why they try to pass off a believable motorcycle courier as an unlikely looking and ill-spoken, antarctic climatologist.

Hooray? More likely, ""Where's the beefcake.....?"" I wanted to see 9 Songs for this reason alone: real sex is almost never shown in any context whatever - fictional or documentary - outside of porn flicks, home videos and Chloe Sevigny. I wanted to see history being made - well, already made. The movements, mechanics, sounds, eyes, body language, licks, faces, rendered by lust and ecstasy can be interesting, even riveting - at least as interesting dogs humping or grasshoppers mating. And it might be, if actors who could act, with bodies that made you drool, were in such a movie. Why the Discovery Channel doesn't have a show devoted to people screwing is less a mystery now. Why a reality show hasn't made it part of its raison d-etre still puzzles me - or is that what Paula Abdul is working toward? In any case, the reason may be that films can make observed sex as boring, disappointing, exploitative, shallow, irrelevant and just plain full of expectations as 9 Songs does. It turns out real sex can look as fake as fake sex - worse. No one has figured out how to make filmed sex FEEL as good as experienced sex. Maybe it's where the power of the media stops. It turns out this film has no story, no acting, no plot, no development, no irony, no creativity, and no reason for existing other than to showcase two actors in love with their own exhibitionism and a cameraman/director who hasn't a clue as to how to show sex as anything but suggestive, who doesn't know when to liberate sex from image.

This may be a moral judgment but how can you retain any real dignity if you are having sex for money with a stranger? To be fair, I've always seen most actors as whores anyway. They trade their privacy, emotions, bodies (not necessarily sexually), physical and mental well being, basically trading their whole selves for the prurient enjoyment of those who choose to watch their work all for what? A chance at fame, fortune, applause, money, to fill an emotional hole?...(feel free to add to the list)....seems like a pretty empty trade off at the end of the day.Of course this is just an opinion but boil it all down and what does anyone really have if they don't have themselves.I'm just tilting at windmills here, I know, but I just can't get it out of my head how degrading it could be to ""act"" in a movie like this for ""arts"" sake.",9 Songs
87,cherootvendors,Badly out of tune,1,7 June 2005,"It is always pleasing to see society progress and become increasingly more liberal in its views. The cinema seems to be doing so at any rate, particularly regarding the current art-house fad for showing explicit sexual imagery. Over the past ten years or so, films like Baise-Moi, Intimacy, The Idiots and Romance have featured hardcore material with the intention of 'saying something' about human sexual relationships. Rarely do they actually say anything of interest, and 9 Songs is certainly no exception. 9 Songs tells the 'story' of an Englishman (Keiran O'Brien) who embarks on a sexual relationship with a slightly kooky American girl (Margot Stilley). And that's it. Oh, and they go to some concerts. After trudging laboriously through the usual clichés (a weekend away; some kinky experimentation; episodes of boredom; the heroine experimenting with her sexuality; jealousy, etc.), the film ends with the predictable split.If the dazzling unoriginality of the relationship itself isn't bad enough, then there is the mind-numbingly awful dialogue. Then there are the various lazy devices used to fill up the very slight (though humorous) running time of 69 minutes: the dull and pointless framing device (O'Brien recalls the relationship while on some expedition); the boring cutaways to live gigs (nine in all, hence the title) and scenes of 'crazy' behaviour (taking drugs, skinny-dipping). The film is very sloppily constructed and written, relying too much on improvisation from two incapable actors.Which brings us to the sex. 9 Songs is the most sexually explicit mainstream film to be released in Britain. It features lingering shots of fellatio, penetration, ejaculation and so on, leaving very little out. True, it has pushed the boundaries of what is acceptable in commercial cinema, but unfortunately it is all for nought. The sex is explicit, but deeply unerotic. Winterbottom's cheap-looking photography/videography looks like some grainy home movie; worse, it looks like the grainy home movie of a very stealthy pervert, making the act of watching this movie feel extraordinarily uncomfortable. The film also gives no real insights into what makes humans tick as sexual companions; for that, look to the latter part of Gaspar Noe's Irreversible (2001), in which we see a realistic portrait of a relationship. Here, the couple is dull and lifeless, even when undergoing daring sexual explorations.But surely the music saves it? Well, no it doesn't. If this film can make sex boring, then it's not going to be hard to make pop music deadening to sit through. Wobbling long shots and a muffled soundtrack reduce some good songs to the tedious plot-fillers they are.Can someone tell me what happened to the Winterbottom of Jude or 24 Hour Party People, as he seems to have left the building (or should I say bedroom?).

88,MilesPieri,In The Realm Of The Senseless.,2,25 April 2005,"Michael Winterbottom is possibly the most exciting director to emerge from the United Kingdom in the last ten years. Prolific (by U.K standards) and already responsible for an eclectic oeuvre Winterbottom seems determined not to be shoe-horned into being seen as a purveyor of any particular genre. 9 Songs follows the arc of a relationship between a young American girl and an Englishman who meet at a Black Rebel Motorcycle Club gig at the Shephards Bush Empire. At the screening I attended Winterbottom introduced the film as his attempt to tell a love story minus what he considers the superfluous elements such as storyline, character development or any real narrative structure at all. What this leaves us with are a series of vignettes devoted almost entirely to the couples lovemaking, intercut with concert footage of various bands performing at the Empire (The aforementioned B.R.M.C,Franz Ferdinand etc.) by way of suggesting the passage of time. It's an audacious conceit and the hardcore sex scenes and highly physical nature of the relationship have a clear precedent in Oshima's Ai no Corrida but Winterbottom's experiment is an almost total failure. Sadly, the problem lays less with the idea and more with the execution. The dialogue (such as it is) is clichéd to the point of banality and there is a noticeable lack of both humour or passion between the two characters. The music sequences seem awkwardly slotted in to the film in order to up the running time and give the audience a brief respite from the dull and, frankly, rather ugly sex scenes. However, even these concert scenes have a listlessness to them unlike, say, the fabulous musical sequences in the directors 24 Hour Party People. Winterbottom should be commended for constantly experimenting with what can be done with film narrative but with 9 Songs it, unfortunately, feels like he's not even trying.

91,petcrows,More true portrayals of life should be celebrated,10,12 August 2005,"Any movie which tries to show sex the way it is deserves a 10 in my book. I live in a part of the US (Utah) where many sexually repressed (& therefore abused & damaged & deranged) people live - where many people live who hate their own bodies & the sexual parts of their natures. I grew up in the culture here which fears & loathes sex & true honest naked human bodies. When I was growing up I hated & resented the sexual feelings I started to have. Now as a mature adult who's rejected the abusive repressive culture of his youth, I am very pleased and honored that Salt Lake City is as of today (12 August 05) one of the places which is showing this film in the US. I commend the film makers for trying to portray sex the way it is - in a way far better than the fakey nonsense of Hollywood, and in a better way than the fakey nonsense of the crass forms of ""porn."" I know that porn was a term created by people who didn't like the wall paintings at Pompeii, and I think that non-fakey non-coercive ""porn"" is highly useful, but fakey porn which has moans and other accouterments which are fake isn't useful. I think we need more portrayals of true human sexuality. It's not all that flashy. It's not fake & restful either. It's just plain old wonderful sex. In ""9 Songs"" one type of sex is shown - the type where the female prefers that the male leave his condom on long term. But the couple is young, and 20 something young adults rightly play the field, and that's good. Anyway, one local repressed-culture-advocating newspaper in Salt Lake referred to this film as a type of ""porn."" I would say that it's not, any more than getting up in the morning and taking a shower, or seeing yourself naked in the mirror, or even your masturbating or having sex is ""porn.""

92,poehlmann,Greatest Strengths Equal Greatest Weaknesses,8,16 December 2005,"May contain spoilers...""Nine Songs"" is one of those rare pictures where it is evident early on that it's greatest strengths are also its greatest weaknesses. More of a meditation on love and loss than a plot-driven romance, it is equal parts concert film and erotica all wrapped up in an art film package. And from within that art film point of reference, one can begin to look at the movie's strengths in various ways.Starting with the obvious, there is the graphic sex. Like other recent mainstream European films that have pushed the boundaries of acceptable visual depictions of sexuality (and to a much lesser extent American indies like the profound meditation of ""The Brown Bunny""), the inclusion of explicit sex acts automatically calls up notions of pornography. The problem here is that porn is subject to very personal definitions. To my mind, porn must be designed to appeal strictly to the most prurient sensibilities in order to fulfill that definition. For this reason, I actually lump excessively and senselessly violent movies into the definition of porn. There is a huge difference between porn and erotica, though both are designed to arouse. Erotica moves beyond being mere porn by appealing to a more multidimensional response, something that ""Nine Songs"" does quite effectively, deliberately and consistently. Even during the explicit scenes, it moves to get into the other aspects of the sex act that exist beyond merely the contact of genitalia. That said, there will be those who still find these scenes vulgar for whatever reason, and it will be hard for them to get around the dramatic arc told through these sexual encounters.Moving to next obvious on the list of alienating strengths, we come to the music. This movie has a fabulous soundtrack  if you like the sort of Brit Pop that ""Nine Songs"" revels in. Like the sex, the music also appears to have an arc that mimics the mood of the relationship, beginning all frenetic and turning blissful, etc. It plays its role well, but it is so prevalent that people who don't like the bands will find themselves disliking nearly a third of the movie that is made up of either live performances or music interludes. This helps to capture a bit of the culture and lifestyle of the characters, puts their relationship in context and otherwise brings the viewer into their world, but strongly skews its core audience young. This is a shame, as its themes are actually quite mature and the story is told with a sort of backward looking wisdom that many young people may not be able to fully appreciate.Then there is the videography. The movie is full of gorgeous imagery and a visual richness lacking in most movies shot on film much less shot on digital video. But the same hand held camera work that draws the viewer into the immediacy of the relationship also can be hard to take in long, constant doses. It is no nausea-inducing ""Blair Witch Project"" debacle, but many will still find it hard to take.With it's narrative structure, ""Nine Songs"" takes a winding road on the way to character introduction and interweaves past and present. You don't really have much insight into who these people are until well into the movie and there is never any real indication of what attracted them to one another, but perhaps that is part of the point. The story is so simple as to be virtually non-existent, yet the characters ultimately ring with their own distinctive truth.",9 Songs

I don't even know if I got it in the director's sense, but I sure got the movie as the milestone it is.First off, what is the, so far, omnipresent characteristic of sex in movies? - Sex portrays something, it speaks in the name of someone/something, it tries to evoke something, it's abused to achieve something... It's always ends and means. There are sex movies that want you to think about the flaws in moralist societies (ken Park, short bus), some want to tell you how screwed up your life is if you're promiscuous (Baise Moi) and others just show copulation to sexually arouse you (any porn movie)...So why is this movie different? - Because it doesn't preach, it doesn't appeal, it doesn't instrumentalize.Have you ever realized how there are no documentaries on relationships with actual sex in them? Sure, some really brave guys tried to insert cut some shameful shots of toned down body parts ""somehow"" humping each other.But sex, like you and me have it. Where you talk, the room is lit, there's no music, no flowers. You just get naked, laugh, touch each other, have sex, talk, laugh again?That's why this movie is a milestone and really got me. I watched it with my wife and we both agreed on ""hey, THIS is how sex really is when you fall in love. Glad somebody got the guts to put it on screen"".So why, you might ask, does this have to be in theaters? - Well, I don't know, to me it was another good step towards demystifying regular sex and telling people ""hey, look, that's perfectly normal and we shouldn't be afraid to see or show it""...Again, don't expect a porn or art-house movie, anything with story or character development.

Normally with a plot like this you would expect a cliché of a romantic comedy were the lovers connect threw something they have in common. Not here, instead of funny situations and soppy dialogue. we are thrown into the couples life of A-class drugs, rock concerts and intense sex life.Which is the films downfall. Its all very exciting watching the couple have real sex on screen but its about 20 minutes threw when i wished it would of been a bit more like all the other romantic chick flicks. The acting is acceptable, cinematography is of grade A standards and choreography of the sex scenes make it seem like a real couple having sex and not as if it was intended to be a porn film.The film isn't a major bomb it does show the lives and loves of young people in greater London well enough and the music is good if your into Indie and Rock music but after 62 minutes of intense graphic sex and little dialogue and strong plot you'll feel kind of cheated.I would of given this film a 5 for originality and footage of the concerts but I'm going to give it a 6 for a good effort by Michael Winterbottom.",9 Songs

A sense of trying to remember a love lost, or lust lost? We try to remember them and sometimes we just remember the physical side, and sometimes as time moves on this is all we have. The memories really struck home to me personally. I often think of my ex and all i can remember is what we shared intimately. because i have tried to hard to forget that she was a human. I found this film very personal, only two characters. The man and the girl. They meet and start a sexual relationship that any person can relate to. The man shares with us his memories and we see some pretty full on sexual acts. Great! Its not a porn movie! its to deep and the characters are very recognizable. Sure the there is the live bands playing at the club, this is the timeouts from the sexual element. and i know that others say the performances are dry and acted badly. but how do we act when we sense that what we thought would last for ever is going to end. over all it was an uncomfortable film with an uncomfortable story played by actors who... well lets face it playing uncomfortable parts. and doing very uncomfortable scenes.

The sex is the counterpoint to the music - Matt really only remembers the great sex and the great music that punctuated their year together. And at the end of the film, she leaves and Matt is yet to fully move on, and life seems as bleak as the Antartic.The point about the quality of the sex is that it doesn't all have to be porn star sex to be great - just being really close to the person you love can be enough to elevate it to the highest plains.",9 Songs

There are long tedious closeups of them snorting cocaine, getting giddy on wine and talking Shiite. I was pretty sure most of the dialog was improv because it was so damn dull.I can't believe this is the same filmmaker who made 'Code 42' and 'The Claim' -- both really good films with excellent plots.Another very explicit UK film, 'Intimacy', is ten times better than this.

100,phattdirty,"Controversial but also pretty dull and ""limp""",5,2 August 2005,"This is purported to be the first film with real explicit sex scenes to be given a mainstream cinema rating (18). I decided to see for myself what all the fuss is about. The film is essentially plot less - two people meet at a concert and for the rest of the film they go to a few more gigs and have lots of sex. Its not a complex film and you don't really need a PhD to work it out. I'm not a prude and extremely broad minded so the sex didn't really bother me. Having said that it wasn't particularly erotic either. The music had its moments but was pretty average and lifeless - kind of like the film. It just felt like a Channel 4 music programme with lots of explicit sex thrown in for the hell of it.I didn't feel much empathy with either of the characters and found myself watching the film all the way to the end to see if it would have some kind of profound ending - it didn't. The girl goes back to America leaving the guy to go to Antartica to do some research (!) Again this subplot is completely pointless - I believe it was Michael Winterbottom's way of getting some nicely shot ""documentary"" footage into his mediocre little art film.I have given this film 5/10 because whilst I felt it was pretty dull and lifeless and neither character did anything for me, it did have a couple of good moments and the controversial nature of the film has broken the last remaining taboos in British film classification. If this can be passed by the BBFC as an 18 because its an 'art' film by a serious British film-maker then I think it would be quite hypocritical of them to pass hardcore pornography with an R18 certificate which only allows it to be sold in sex shops.

101,luket,"9 things I would rather do that dignify this movie as interesting, provocative, intelligent, challenging....",1,30 October 2009,"I was once told that nobody liked soft porn. Porn lovers hated it because it was,... well 'soft' and porn haters hated it because it was porn. Enter Peter Winterbottom - a man who wants to make a bit of R-18 porn (the full frontal, penetrative kind) but who doesn't want people to think that he actually wanted to make porn, so he tries to convince people that one of most boring films of all time is an explicit, yet subtle exploration of a relationship. No doubt the closet, porn-loving, anti porn guys will love this movie. 'Is that porn you are watching dear...I thought you hated porn.'......'No honey, it's actually a very tender exploration of the physical act of love. I am definitely not watching it because its the only film I could rent at Blockbuster where I could see all the naughty bits.' The reality is that if someone hadn't managed to convince some idiot that they could show full sex in a film, this would have never been made. As a concept (excluding the bodily fluids) its not even a story - Two kids meet, listen to some music, have sex...not exactly Dickens! However if you add the, 'you can see them actually do it' factor into the equation its makes the film a marketable project.I must confess I watched it because it was the first film I heard of that showed real sex and tried to take itself seriously. More fool me for my curiosity. If anything the film made me feel a little uncomfortable. It was voyeuristic and I couldn't help but think that the two leads got duped into the roles in the belief that showing a couple of their orgasms might make them big stars. It seems a little immoral that no-one told them it would probably ruin their careers, which to date it seems to have done.Anyone who tries to legitimise this film is either on the right end of a paycheck or is too gutless to say that they enjoyed watching a couple of actors exploited.I can handle the fact that a Mac Donalds is Mac Donalds, but don't try and serve it to me on some fine china and tell me its fine dining.I hope the actors sue Winterbottom for even hinting that they should make this film and I hope people see this film for what it is. There's no benefit moaning about the graphic nature of the film....it literally says on the box what to expect, so if you don't wanna see sex save some of your life and money and give this a miss. It would be nice if someone noticed that this is exactly what it claims not to be. A dumb turd of a movie that shamelessly exploits the human urge to watch a bit of fornication. It's a shame the sh#@!y director didn't have the decency to be honest about his intentions...I am sure the small inde' budget would have been enough for some skint couples around the world to let him watch them have sex and film it.A patronising concept, and one flaccid sausage of a movie.

105,garvneil,"shagging, interludes...and music concerts.......",5,4 January 2006,"Upon reading some of the reviews on the comment board, i noticed something that i see a lot more prevalently on this site. Typecasting the type of person who does or does not like a certain movie. Now, i read on more than one occasion in a few reviews that anyone who did not like this movie was someone who who had not been in a meaningful relationship or could not see past the film and find the true beauty in it. All this is very lazy and very qualitative. Ones perception of a piece of art is subjective to their own perception of it and is totally unique and no less relevant than anyone else's. To brandish someone less worthy of assimilating a film just because you think they are, is total rubbish. So i begin my review of Nine Songs by saying it is one of the worst films i have ever seen.I have enjoyed Winterbottom's other films including 24 hour party people and Wonderland. He has been brave in choosing such explicit content however straight sex on screen does not impact unless it is buffered with engaging characters whom you can identify with to some degree. He has used very broad strokes here in showing the arc of the relationship. The main social interaction between the two comes in the form of the music concerts. They come across more as promo's for the bands latest album. They don't add any nuance or momentum to the relationship which is the heart of the film. Yes we can all identify with aspects of the film. Most of us have been in a relationship and most of us have been to music concerts. So what?There is nothing here to bolster the plot. The sex seemed loveless and cold just like the film. I was left feeling empty. Not empty because the relationship had run its course however, i never felt anything for the relationship in the first place. Intimacy is a film that contains real sex but has much more of a punch to it as the director weaves a narrative around them that engages the viewer. Next time Mr. Winterbottom.",9 Songs
106,p.greenwood,Unwatchable,1,26 October 2005,I rented 9 songs as I was curious to see what the fuss was about. I also enjoy the subject of censorship so was wondering what they were allowing in a relatively mainstream movie. I won't lie to you I was shocked. Not by the explicit sex on show but more by what was allowed to be shown in a non porn movie. Another thing that shocked me was to see Kieron O'Brian a face who isn't completely unfamiliar to British television. What I didn't understand was how the actors and directors seem to justify the use of such explicit scenes. I was hoping to see certain peoples view of it being necessary or being art but I didn't. All I saw was footage of live bands with sex scenes slipped in. It was like watching a live concert with subliminal sex scenes in it. Let me get this straight I have no problems whatsoever with sex in films. It just seemed to me like they were trying to shock and see how far they could go. Which judging from the film was quite a long way. By doing this they seemed to forget the story and the whole film ended up being dull. By the end of the movie I was left wondering who the film was aimed at. The porn fans won't find it explicit enough and the film fans will just find it dull and maybe a step too far. Maybe I just didn't get it and somebody reading this will love the movie. I will continue with the opinion that Kieron O'Brian has done himself no favours with this film and maybe one day he'll regret it. I certainly regret watching it.,9 Songs
107,notfunny,An interesting effort,4,7 March 2006,"I came across this film purely by accident, and then found the negative comments drawing me in. Truthfully this film is not that bad. While at best, ratings wise, it would fall somewhere in the lower middle, but if you are someone who likes to sample Independent films out there, there could be a lot worse ways of spending your rental. Basically its the story of a romance told in parts through the mind of the male side of the couple. It uses of varying concerts to cover the different stages of this relationship, thus the title of the movie. While the movie is told from the male's side, you do get her point of view on the relationship by what she says and does. He thinks long lasting, more permanent, while she is interested in just the romance of the moment.While the actors spend most of their screen time engaged in sex, the realness of it did not seem to offend me as it has others. While some condemn it as pornography, I would tend to want to use the terms honest and daring. You could only make this movie using young actors, who were not afraid to take chances. Having listened to the interviews on the DVD, it was more obvious the chances being taken here, as the dialog was mostly improvised. While the movie has a short running time, the concert pieces at times could see almost padding. From the interviews and discovering that there was not a short shooting schedule (thought they said ten weeks) I wonder what footage was left out, as going a bit deeper into the relationship would have been more helpful. If you like independent films don't avoid this, unless you have problems with nudity and sex. It just reminded me of Kevin Smith's Chasing Amy (a totally better film) in that if I had let the frequent overuse of the ""F"" word chase me away, I would hate to think of his other movies that I would have missed.",9 Songs

First of all he flies across the antarctic and tells us it's cold. Then he's at a concert jumping up and down to some rock band or other. And then he's having sex with an American lady. And then he's back in the antarctic and the whole process repeats itself. I made to turn over and watch Terry and June on UK Drama but mother held me back. She was keen to see what developed. We'd paid, she said, and anyway she's a bit of an Antonioni buff and quite used to this sort of thing. Something would happen. It did. The American lady spilt the hairy man's 'stuff' all over him and I spilt hot tea all over my legs and had to go and sit in a cold bath for the next couple of hours.

109,carloz46,"Boring, badly shot",3,26 January 2006,"Michael Winterbottom is undoubtedly a good and serious writer/director, and I have to say that if the point of this film is to push the censorship envelope then it clearly succeeds (which is why I have slightly mixed feelings about it). That it does so on a rather low budget is, sadly, apparent in the cinematography.Shot (badly) on video, the colour balance is all over the place. The lighting is mostly pretty awful, giving a sort of ugly documentary feel which doesn't quite come off because sometimes it looks like a failed attempt at sensuous and beautiful. Or perhaps that's deliberate and ironic? Frankly, I don't much care because the film, for me, had a peculiarly effective way of sapping any enthusiasm I originally felt for watching people having sex on-screen, and went on to nibble away at my enthusiasm for staying awake, breathing etc.Music I don't like, no plot whatsoever, awful dialogue and an uninspired, un-believable sex-based relationship lacking any convincing chemistry left me with the (uncharitable) impression that the casting was mostly about who was prepared to be filmed having sex for general release and that the writing was mostly about leaving the actors to make it up as they went along.In fairness, I suspect that if the protagonists had looked like they actually enjoyed having sex, the censors mightn't have passed it, which is perhaps the point of this film. My hope is that it was worthwhile and, having classified this, the BBFC must now take the position that adult British audiences are to be considered grown-up enough to watch consensual sex by way of entertainment. (However badly done, it's got to be better than being entertained by bloody violence, I think.) Perhaps worth (Brits) watching for the novelty value of uncensored sex in a movie on general release, just don't expect it to be any good. Probably an ""important"" film in the UK, and I daresay it paid handsomely. If I had to choose between this and some gangster movie or bloodthirsty thriller, I'd have to go for this, but I might take earphones and an alternative soundtrack and possibly something to read.",9 Songs
110,haz22,"It's pornographic, but is it art?",5,23 March 2006,"So some people claimed that this film is not pornographic. Really! Any film that shows explicit sex acts and has scene of male ejaculation is within the realm of pornography. Trying to split hair as to whether it is done in a ""real and honest way"" or ""it's part of real life"" is just plain silly, it only showed that the reviewers are quite ignorant of the range and diversity of porn. In fact you can argue that there are more realistic sex in some types of porn as they feature ordinary people - balding men and overweight women, not people with perfect bodies as shown in the film. The only question is whether this film can be considered art, and that, unfortunately, is entirely debatable.According to the director, ""it was about doing a film where you could genuinely try and capture the intimacy of two people being in love, the physical intimacy, and hopefully the emotional intimacy."" If that is the case, he has failed miserably. There are plenty of physical intimacy alright, but what is striking in this film is the lack of emotional intimacy between the two main characters. Certainly the two are interested in each other sexually, but it's hard to tell whether they are in love or not. Perhaps the director isn't aware of the fact portraying love convincingly is more difficult than showing two people having sex.I have no objection to a film which is explicitly pornographic, the only question is whether it works well as a film. Sadly, this film veers on the dull side, and if you are not interested in the music, it can be excruciatingly tedious. It is, I would say, an interesting experiment, and on this, and on this alone, I would applaud this effort. But when it doesn't quite hit the mark, I'm left more with concern for the actor and actress involved (well, perhaps not so much for the man, there is nothing he showed that he wants to be ashamed of, and the sexist world being as it is), whether their exposure here will come to haunt them in the future.",9 Songs

The only thing to differentiate 9 Songs is it's the most explicit film in British film history and believe me that's nothing to be proud of.Now, I love film. I want to be entertained, challenged. It should be life affirming or even, at its best, life changing. But this is dreck, drivel and dross and utterly meritless.You can see how the director's thought processes were working - 'I like indie music. I like sex. I'l make a film about both and get some schmuck to finance it.' More like an extended short with no narrative and very little dialogue the film is summed up thus: the two leads go to rock concerts, shag then do the same again. And again. And again. That's it. People don't actually do anything or say anything much except a few mumblings here and there that is supposed to pass for conversation and communication. There's some attempt at an explanatory thread going on with a bizarre metaphor about Antarctica and how relationships are claustrophobic and agoraphobic at the same time.Thinking it has something profound to say about the human condition, this film is pretentious, self indulgent and self absorbed which, like the music, is all style and no substance - a film of such epic pseudo- intellectual proportions, it disappears up its own arse (surprisngly, one of the few sexual acts not appearing in the film).God knows what the actors thought they were getting themselves into, and I'm sure everyone went into it with their eyes wide open, but the whole thing just comes across as exploitive. In fact, if titilation's what you want, there's more entertainment in your average porn film, and it's cheaper.Michael Winterbottom will be forever remembered as the man who put the first cum shot in a mainstream British film and it could also possibly be a world first.

I saw it on sale in HMV for £20 and the only recommendation I will give is that that is FAR, FAR too expensive as it can be found much cheaper at the click of a mouse.

115,mr__hyde,"Explicit, but more than that",8,27 March 2005,"I will freely admit that I saw this movie solely based on the fact that it has received so much publicity concerning the sex scenes. And for the most part, I saw exactly what I expected to see in the sex scenes. It was probably more explicit than in any other 'mainstream' film I've seen, but what separates this from pornographic is that there is definite artistic intent to the film. I am a fan of the films done recently by people such as Catherine Breillat and Bruno Dumont, and was one of the few people in the Midwestern US to think that 'The Brown Bunny' was a beautiful film, so you know where I'm coming from. But I actually see some parallels between TBB and 9 Songs. Whereas Vincent Gallo uses the road as a backdrop to his musical choices for TBB, Winterbottom uses live shows as a backdrop for his music. Just listening to the lyrics of the music, and the characters talk about Antarctica clues you in to many things about the relationship that he then doesn't have to waste screen time pursuing.I do agree with some people's comments that the sex scenes did not always seem to mirror where the couple was in the relationship, but contrary to feeling this stilted the story, I felt it made it more real. We are never told exactly how long they are together, exactly how they met, but we are told through these constantly differing encounters that it is a real relationship. It is not glamorized and turned into a fake sort of story at all by having a constant arc - what relationship has a arc that doesn't go up and down? Every romance has up and down times, and sometimes the best ups are right before the biggest down. I thought he arranged his scenes pretty masterfully to that end.Overall, I rated this film an 8, only because it wouldn't let me do 7.5. You could watch this simply to be titillated, or you could watch it to gain insight into how real relationships are and take a break from the Hollywood norm.",9 Songs
116,berylsmiaow,Actually pretty thought-provoking,7,17 March 2006,"This film has had a lot of criticism and a lot of controversy because of its explicit nature. I have to admit I was both in intrigued by it and hesitant to watch it because of that. But the idea of movie actually showing sex as it is and how it can continue in the atmosphere of a relationship as it breaks down finally won me over. And I have to say, I enjoyed this movie. To me, it's not at all pretentious, because it's charting a man's memories of a very important time in his life, and how even in a desolate and isolated environment as the Antarctic, he can visualise that time, and how he felt. We don't know when it happened, although you can guess from the music, but this could be a memory from years ago. He could be married now. They could be married now. You don't know, which is part of the beauty of the film. We all have memories, and they can hit us at the most unexpected moment. And it's not just about the sex, it's about the music too. If you think about it, he's remembering the music as much as he's remembering the sex. The impression I got from this film was that it was charting how one person's view of a relationship can be totally different from their partner's view. Think about it, how often have you've been in a relationship only to find out your so-called partner thinks you're only casually dating? There were a lot of hints to this in the movie. To Lisa, it was a very physical relationship. To Matt, it was more than that, it was love. He wanted to do all the things that boyfriends and girlfriends do. Make dinner for her, take her away for the weekend, go to gigs. He even wanted to celebrate Thanksgiving for her. For Lisa, that wasn't what she wanted, she was wanting a partner in life's events, not life itself. So when she feels it's time to leave, it isn't a big deal to her, and that's clear from how she acts when she tells him she's leaving, he's angry and hurt, but her instinct is to take him to bed. So, give it a try. Anyone who's been in a unbalanced relationship, will recognise these characters. Oh and as for the sex? Is this just porn or not? No, it definitely isn't, but it's a very highly charged erotic movie, so you probably don't want to go watching it with your parents!",9 Songs
117,DeadlyOutlawREKKA,Pointless,1,6 April 2005,"I came into this movie expecting an intimate portrayal of love and passion. What I got was something completely different.First of all, there was no storyline, any attempt to build characterisation (therefore making all sex scenes void as you did not care for them) and the one thing that really bothered me was that none of the sex scenes reached to the climax, instead Winterbottom opts to cut to either another sex scene or a live performance.That leads me to the other half of the movie, the gigs. Again they felt pointless, and seeing it on a big screen manages to nullify the performances rather then enhance them.The whole film felt like a big rip-off of Jean Luc Godard, especially A Bout De Soufflé. As for the dialogue, it was dreadful, as were the performances. But what do you expect when you have to employ people with no acting abilities just to show explicit sex?Altogether, the whole film feels like a poor excuse for art, and Winterbottom seem desperate to try and be as provocative as his Galic friends, such as Gasper Noe, yet fails miserably.How people can say this film has any merit I will never know. Watch Ai No Corrida (Realm of the Senses) instead. This film was made in 1976, is just as explicit, but actually has characterisation, good acting and is emotionally reactive rather then just trying to pass itself of as subversive cinema.",9 Songs

Despite close up shots of genitalia and scenes of drug use, the story has an air of innocence to it. The relationship is uncomplicated and so are the characters. This movie is just a up close look at a simple relationship but with a touch of deja vu and poetic enough to make the viewer sympathize with the characters.",9 Songs

The film is a thematic commentary on sexual politics and is designed to be graphic yet realistic in order to relate directly to its audiences experiences. It shows how fickle the most intensely sexual relationships can be and how easily we can mistake lust for love. It is going to be controversial due to the central theme of sex. If you can put the film into context as not a gratuitous sex film, but simply an accurate portryal of reality, it is actually quite liberating to watch. Don't get me wrong, this is not a good 'film' but it has some value attached to its unflinching realism.

The characters are not developed, the disturbances of the relation are somehow sens-able but not really reasonable. To be frank even if it was only a short movie I got really bored after a while...What I also did not understand why there was the use of cocaine in the film.Maybe I just lack the understanding of art.

121,Smkeeley,Great performances (onstage and off),10,30 September 2005,"Starting off with British guy Matt in Antartica, surveying the land, the movie is a flashback to his fling with an American girl named Lisa (Margo Stilley, who looks like a taller, learner Maggie Gyllenhaal). The two go to a great concert, have sex, go to a great concert, have sex, rinse, repeat 7 more times. Amazingly, even though you're only seeing the sex, you're seeing the reality of a relationship and able to see the emotions and feelings of both people from beginning to end. It's an interesting note to all those movies out there who try to show everything BUT the sex...maybe you're missing the real point.Of course what really makes the movie a must-watch is the performances. One of a kind concert footage from some of my personal favorite bands, Franz Ferdinand, Black Rebel Motorcycle Club, The Von Bondies, Super Fury Animals and Primal Scream. If you're a fan of these bands, its like getting a bonus DVD of footage.Be warned, the sex is real. No faking, no CGI. But it doesn't really feel like porn, least not to me. Winterbottom shots it the film on digital video, probably the best way to capture all the concerts. The film's a solid 65 minutes, just the perfect amount of time to course the relationship of two people in lust.",9 Songs
122,An_American_in_Paris,Sex and ice and rock & roll,6,14 March 2005,"Michael Winterbottom's new film will certainly raise eyebrows for its frank portrayal of a couple engaged in a wide range of sexual activities. Obvious parallels are drawn between two pursuits, taking in rock & roll at various concerts and making love. The addition of scenes of the Antarctic draws attention to an aspect of both: the potential for loneliness in the midst of what should be an orgasmic experience. Extreme closeups of bodies start to look like the icescapes of the one continent that remained unexplored until the twentieth century. I suspect that the ratings for the film are primarily reactions, positive or negative, to the explicitness of the sex scenes, but one could argue that it also should be judged for what it is trying to say about relationships and the relationship between sex and love. I'm not sure it wholly succeeds in illuminating that relationship, but it certainly makes a valiant effort. One final word of warning: if extremely graphic depiction of sexual relations leaves you uncomfortable, avoid the film altogether.",9 Songs

The music was filmed in a cheap way, the soundtrack at times very poor - but I've been to many gigs in my time where that is the way the audience sees and hears it - more realistic than Dolby 5.1 soundtrack and close ups of the lead singer (get it?). Same with the scenes around the flat and outside... real looking, not overly glossy, trendy, expensive or just plain unbelievable, but untidy, dimly lit, quaint almost... The sex to me looked loving, real and again believable - the opposite to 99% of porn. The so called money shot was the first I've seen in non-porn films... and I thought it looked in place with the atmosphere and imagery within this film. As you can see I liked it... I think the actors were brave to do it and expose themselves (no pun intended) to achieve not art, not porn, but a portrayal of the realities of life - a relationship that founded on attraction and lust, with some definite signs of love, but was there enough friendship to sustain their long term needs and wants...

I grew rather tired of watching endless sexual encounters between the same couple, and when they weren't having sex, they were usually kissing.There was little character development, and the viewer was given very subtle hints at what appeared to be a story about to develop - yet never did.

It is a brave attempt to show a couple having sex in the most natural way.This film breaks taboos in cinema. Real erection,real ejaculation,real oral sex,real penetration and real female orgasm.

But it wasn't presented to me that way. The DVD was given to me by a girl friend as ""some of the best porn"" she'd ever seen. I find it an extremely interesting film in this sense. Eventually porn will fully cross into art and find legitimacy. Sex is just too important to society for this not to happen eventually, as we shed the last of our Victorian scales and really grow in the freedom provided us by the sexual revolution of the last century. 9 Songs does a good job of taking a step in this direction. The actors really have sex. So does that make it porn? Is porn less than art by definition? The answers are subjective of course.

135,macboswell,Is this really a spoiler considering there is no plot?,1,29 May 2006,"A sorry nonsensical excuse for a porn flick. Why in the world director Michael Winterbottom has confused himself into believing that by putting footage of live gigs in between explicit sex scenes warrants the film (I say film in loose terms, more like 'footage') as 'mainstream' or 'art-house' and not 'porn' is beyond me. This truly was a waste of a cinema ticket.The films plot or lack of one, consists of footage of live rock concerts followed by sex scenes followed by more live concert footage and more sex scenes in a vicious circle of tedium. This tiresome, lazy drivel is obvious proof that Michael Winterbottom is incapable of producing a film which shows the relationship between rock n roll and sex without simply forcing poor live footage of some great bands and gratuitous sex scenes in front the viewer over and over again. Boring.On a plus note for Winterbottom, this film has has NO redeeming features: A dreadful script if there was one, terrible sound quality especially for a film called '9 Songs' and as for the acting; it cannot really be judged considering that the sex scenes were so explicit that there was 'no acting required'. The film looks as though it was shot using a web cam and then edited on a mobile phone, incoherent and flawed in every way imaginable.In short, if you want to make a honest porn flick make one and I might even buy it, but don't dress up live footage of rock bands with explicit sex scenes and expect us to be blinded into believing it's not a porn flick.

136,ruibento,"9 songs - or the boredom behind sex, rock & roll and drugs",1,7 September 2005,"Winterbottom's past works had ofter rotated around issues like social and political concerns. This time around, the director decided to pick a whole different subject, but an equally controversial one: sex. And that's what ""9 Songs"" is all about.It all begins in Atarctida, where an Englishman is doing something we know nothing about and begins to think back about a relationship he had with an American girl, in London. The flashbacks start at the Brixton Academy, at a ""Black Rebel Motorcycle Club"" concert where she met this girl. Then it quickly goes to a relatively song sex scene... then, for some reason, back to Brixton and back to sex right after. And this keeps happening over and over again (9 times, actually) throughout the movie, with a few interruptions to go back to Antarctida, where the Englishman is still doing whatever he was doing that we still don't know anything about. Ah, and they also do drugs every now and then, between sex and songs.There is not much more that can be said about this movie. It takes only 65 minutes but it's incredibly dull and utterly pointless. There's virtually no story (even if you try hard it's difficult to find something that resembles a story) and the characters have no depth at all, with the movie ending and us knowing not much more than there names, countries of origin and the fact that they have sex, go to concerts and do drugs. Actually, at some point, this movie is so raw that it resembles a cheap porno reality show rather than the artful movie it claims to be.In the end, we leave the theater with the feeling that he hadn't seen much more than two actors being paid to have sex and a few good bands that can't rescue this movie from mediocrity.

139,KeeganDeWitt,A unique experience,9,26 July 2005,"It seems strange to have such an affection for a film that is so flawed and fails in so many areas. Either way, I really really enjoyed Nine Songs, a relationship drama told strictly through sex. First, we'll list the failures. The acting of our female lead is a bit suspect and makes her, in the end, unlikable. The photography, although intimate and immediate, suffers from it's DV quality and makes you wonder how beautiful this film could have been shot with the eye of perhaps... Lars Von Trier's dogma lense. Most importantly, the movie relies on two ingredients that in the end prove a bit useless. We are reliving the story in memory via the male lead as he travels through Antarctica. Although it is an interesting metaphor and a captivating landscape, it seems almost entirely unnecessary. We hear him say ""you can be clostraphobic and agoraphobic all at the same time, much like the bedroom."" Secondly, and most important, the live music is inconsequential, although good. The actual image quality is low, the songs play for too long, the lyrics apply to the narrative not at all, and the bands all flirt with one style (Michael Nyman being the exception). I must say, there is an outstanding version of ""Jacqueline"" by Franz Ferdinand.Now let me tell you where the film succeeds. We experience two young, naive, selfish personalities infatuated with one another, and the idea of one another. This is expressed in the most immediate and intimate fashion: SEX. We see two people in the prime of a relationship, in which the most sex is had, and as much as possible, however possible, symbolizing favors, trust, forgiveness, revenge, and all the other facets of a relationship. These scenes also succeed because of their length, the total lack of music, and the director's willingness to let them exist without explanation. Although these two characters are not even particularly likable or explained to us, we end up feeling as if we've shared something very deep with them, solely based on the extent to which we are asked to hang with them throughout the long and graphic and no holds barred sex scenes.It may seem sick, but by the end, as a graphic fellatio scene ends with actual ejaculation, you have become so acclimatized to this topic, and it being our main source of communication, that there is an almost unspoken dialogue between all parties. Instead of feeling offended, we feel love for the privacy of the moment, for the trust and sharing that happens there. Instead of feeling aroused, we feel compelled by the motives, interested in the roles played and mindful of the moment shared.By asking that you step into a theater, with total strangers, and watch many graphic sexual encounters, many unexplained and without the usual Hollywood ramp-up, you have signed over a certain amount of control and comfort as an audience-member, which in the end, offers a truly unique experience of the ""love story"". When all is said and done, ""Nine Songs"" evoked a truly unique and loving response from me, in spite of the fact that as a film, it fails in many areas. I would not say that many films should be made like this, but I would say that it is flirting with a new form of love story that is raw, beautiful and in the end, no matter how many times it fails, honest by the sheer default of it's topic.",9 Songs

When a middle aged man displays intense interest in the sex lives of younger people, that's not interesting or innovative. that's masturbation.

142,7xmt-b5nd,where is the love.,1,27 June 2005,"Nine Songs is a disturbing film, I felt sad and angry for watching the damn thing. For me it is pornography, and it is from a male perspective, I believe it is meant to be. Our western culture is really bizarre, there are many experiences and connections missing from the lives we live, we have become isolated and unsure. Nine Songs captures this, why else do many of the comments here detail the lack of story or point to the shallow relationship of the two involved. There is one moment, however, where I connected with the vulnerability of the characters, when he is skinny-dipping. The sex, like our present culture, is obsessive and unfeeling, more about being entertained than sharing a spiritual moment of intimacy. We live in a pornographic culture, being bombarded with the stuff constantly. Sex has become entertainment, like music and obsessive doom and gloom documentaries about nature as if it is something totally separate from our own lives. No feelings, plastic, gratification, drugs, total avoidance of feelings, out of touch with the event, how lonely they looked in the bath together. We live in a media technological culture and this movie captures it, hence the parallel process the other comments reflect. This movie hopefully challenges us to ask ourselves when or have I ever had a truly intimate sexual experience, and why can't I, or like the two characters here, as it been about mutual shared masturbation, it might as well have been sex with a rubber doll. Definitely porn, shaved pubes, big dick and a money shot. Is this all there is left, the decades of fighting against censorship around sex in main stream cinema, when it arrives it's porn after all, what a let down.",9 Songs
143,francescoba03,"two persons, in a real story",8,19 July 2005,"This movie may not be a masterpiece, but still deserves huge credit for its incorporation of sex as an integral part of the narration and for its intentionally minimalist story. At the end we are left with many questions, from how they met (at a concert, we may assume, but how?) to why she went back to USA. We have hints of tensions and problems, but they are not analyzed and dissected. Paradoxically, all these are positive points. The camera does not offer a 'god-like' perspective: instead it present us with the same limitations experienced by real people in real life. We see this story, as any story that we can live, by fragments and allusions, having to make our own assumptions about what 'else' was there. The characters don't develop? Perhaps it is better: the fiction of the opening of the inner life to the viewer/voyeur is perhaps the greatest cheat in Western narrative, at least since the time of Romanticism. We meet each other through confusion and with mystery, not in clarity and 'development'. Sex is also part of this mystery, and the movie reproduces it with full honesty. Our texts, as well as our lives, could greatly improve by accepting more of this mystery.",9 Songs
144,tmddublin,This might be a spoiler - where's the story?,4,17 March 2005,"Director Michael Winterbottom has succeeded admirably in putting actual sex between actors up on the big screen while avoiding pornographic titillation but...so what? What's the point? That it can be done? Just because a thing can be done doesn't necessarily mean it should be done and it certainly doesn't mean it will necessarily be worthwhile or entertaining. That he's the first? Well, he's not. In The Realm Of The Senses also has actual sex between its actors but the director of that film remembered to include a dramatic story as well. Lars Von Trier's The Idiots has a brief gang bang scene with a shot of actual penetration - again Von Trier, despite his adherence to Dogma rules, managed to include something as old-fashioned and audience-pleasing/provoking as a story. 9 Songs is a nothing film - it's not erotic, it's not funny, it's not tragic, it's not philosophical, it's not life-affirming, it's not life-damning.

I found nothing artistic about the way the movie was filmed, nor did I find the relevance of the title to the movie. May be nine songs were performed by the artists who were at the concert that the main characters attended -- who knows, I certainly didn't keep track. And why the unsimulated sex? For realism? Why make those tasteless close ups of their genitalia, seemingly trying to PROVE to the audience that they weren't kidding when all the sex scenes were real?

147,alperozpinar,a visual soundtrack of images about a couple...,8,1 April 2006,"I have seen 9 songs about a week ago but still it runs in the back of my mind as a soundtrack of images. The nature of the relationship of the couple is astonishing due to its simplicity. I am talking about this simplicity as a major point for the film because it is the simple nature of men and women(especially young adults) to live their lives similar to the way of the characters. What makes the movie so powerful in the background is that,although the sex scenes seem to dominate the story, it is much more enlightening in terms of human nature to see beyond the visible. That is, the basis of their relationship is not based on sex and having good times, but contributing to each other's individual development and spiritual growth. It is not my desire to support these ideas by relating them to scenes from the movie.Instead, my will is that those who watch this movie should not only focus on the sexual side of the relationship, but also the nature of the relation. Then, as audience, you will have a true understanding of what is being tried to be conveyed.",9 Songs

I remember my young innocent jaw dropping at the sights that were meeting my eyes. As I watched '9 Songs' my old not so innocent jaw dropped in a similar fashion, though in this case it was in sheer confusion. What is this film meant to be, what does it think it is, soft porn? National Geographic?? Concert film?? It tries to be all three in quick succession and fails on all levels. If this is groundbreaking British cinema then I pity the state of British cinema. Sure you might see a wee clip of your fave band, you might learn a wee bit about frozen wastelands, you might even get mildly titillated by the naughty bits, but all in all you'd be better to hire a concert film, a National Geographic film, and if you're in the mood for something slightly racy I could always ask my mate if he still has that video tape!",9 Songs

And OK, admit it, the photography was kinda cool, but the movie had a lack of argument, sequence on narrative and also some better end.Like I said before it was for britrock fans, and I'm not one of them (but that's another story).

Despite all the very explicit sex there is no build up to it, resulting in a complete lack of any sexual tension - and the dreary repetitiveness of the sex act robs it of any eroticism. There is a limit to how long two people banging away in a room, with nothing else remotely resembling a plot going on, can hold the viewers interest. It doesn't help that the chief protagonists are not very attractive (my very subjective opinion, admittedly) and the whole pointless charade is punctuated periodically by loud bursts of awful music (although some might consider these intervals the best bits of the film).",9 Songs
151,purered,A big fuss about nothing.,1,1 August 2006,"The fuss in the media, and by word of mouth, led me to want to see this film. I have always had a deep interest in censorship, be it of film, music, art or any freedom of expression.I approached this film with the hope that it had been passed by the censors because it had some kind of beautiful message or story to tell. That the overall worth of the film had outweighed the controversy of the sexual content and it was such a well made film that to deny it a release would have been an injustice to film making.But I was deeply disappointed. If you take away the explicit content of the film, it has nothing. It says nothing. It goes nowhere.It has no particular storyline or insight to offer, the sex scenes are all it has to carry it. Without that it becomes nothing but a collection of badly filmed concert footage. As for the musical artists chosen, they are like the film..for twenty-somethings who think they are being daring and are pushing the boundaries, but are walking the safest path right down the middle of the road.The characters are not developed at all, and what you do see and learn of them makes them instantly unlikable. Neither are they particularly attractive- which makes the sexual content unpleasant to watch. It may be (slightly) graphic but those people watching only for the hope of a sexual thrill will also be very disappointed. I would much rather have seen this film without the graphic sexual content, and a more satisfying storyline exploring the relationship between the couple. As it is, it just lets you down in all areas. It is put forward as a unique insight into a couples love making, but comes across as the cold, functional sex of a one night stand. There is not the passion, or the intensity, of a genuine loving relationship.The film needed to be longer, to give time to develop the characters or some kind of story and give the viewer something to grasp. The sixty six minutes running time leaves you thinking ""is that it?"" and wanting a refund- both of the money paid for the film and the hour of your life you just wasted. It will remain notorious for its sexual content, and continue to appeal to those who have not seen it. Once seen, it loses any appeal.This film is most likely to end up being passed around schools by thirteen year old boys and skipped to the sex scenes, or more likely the sex scenes downloaded from a peer to peer network.I suppose the whole film does have one thing, an element of realism. It is like watching a very expensively filmed home video but as everyone knows other peoples lives may seem interesting at a distance, but close up they are just as boring as your own.In this case, dull is an understatement.Maybe that is the point..but if this film does have one, it is very cleverly disguised.I really wanted to like this film. I really wanted it to be the ground breaking, brave, work of artistic genius that the media promised.That this was the film that would open the gates for a more honest era of censorship.It isn't any of those things, the most interesting thing about it is the question of how it was given a certificate..the biggest question is why bother making it in the first place?",9 Songs
152,spamjewce,60 minute pretentious prelude to penetration,1,3 August 2006,"This film stinks of pretension, as do all of the positive reviews I have read about it.I'll make my points short and sweet.1. If I have to obtain external info (a synopsis, a forward, a cast and crew interview, or a commentary) to understand the film maker's intentions, the film as a medium has failed.2. If this is supposed to be a story... it is lost.3. If this a myopic of human sexuality, I can possibly except that as the reason I just wasted 67 minutes of my time. But sex is not love, and I knew where to put it before I left grade school. I didn't need two college age students to show me.This film is not about relationships- its nothing more than a human equivalent of the Wild Kingdom- the mating rituals of homo sapiens. Unlike the Wild Kingdom, and just like porn, you actually get to see the film's ""climax."" I am not a prude by any stretch. But there is no Bohemian facet to this film. It is porn plain and simple.

154,powelton,Makes adult behavior safe for grown-ups again,8,31 July 2005,"Michael Winterbottom has redeemed sex for grown-ups in the movies. He has discarded the theatrics and acrobatics of porn and, at the other end of the scale, the overbearing artistic aspirations of, for example, the sex scene in ""Don't Look Now"" (which, on a good day, I do not necessarily think was too beautiful for its own good). Winterbottom's approach looks more like what real people do when cameras are not present. There's a lot to be said for that in a world where most directors would be inclined to overdirect. And the interplay between the song sequences and the sequences when the couple is alone is right. Just as the live music performances trade the polish of studio recordings for the vitality and rough edges of life, so do the sex scenes offer the power of reality--and its imperfections--in the place of meticulous attention to lighting and makeup. Winterbottom has edited rather than choreographed and, despite his success in carrying it off, I doubt that many directors would be willing to take the risk of using that technique.",9 Songs

There's no story, you don't care about actors, because the film only brings you the possibility to see them having sex. You don't see anything else.

157,ChuckReff,Warning!!! there is no love made in this film... for a change,10,30 September 2005,"The major complaint I hear about this movie is how unromantic the sex is... A majority of sexual acts, i assume, are not out of love, but merely physical acts. Gratification of sexual impulses plus some sort of human contact and intimacy. Porno tries to physically turn you on, romances try to emotionally turn you out. 9 Songs tries to represent not the love of two people but a relationship of sex. The film opens with Matt's voice over saying that all he remembers about Margo is the sex. Not a lot of heart so why should their sex be beautiful or passionate? You may then question 'why do i need to see this'... why are people constantly in vapid sexual relationships even though they are searching for love? because that's real and sometimes all that you can get or what you're willing to try for. This film wants to show you that sometimes sex isn't romantic or ugly it just is simple and basic. The film isn't a commentary on their relationship or love or happiness, it lets you experience that little tryst you had a couple years ago that was fun for awhile and then you moved on. Why should you remember that? because it happens to all of us and cinema has failed to show it to us correctly. I think to appreciate the film you need to get past what cinema has demanded we get from films about love and sex. Realize there's something more than what the biased cinema has given us before. It's a chunk of reality without ever-present film commentary. You have to get rid of your hypocritical view that will force you to jump in the bed with someone but then think it's nasty or shocking to see two people naked up on a screen. Take a chance and open yourself up to something that is so revolutionary in its unedited reality.",9 Songs

It's extremely rare that i'll see good acting and full nudity in graphic sex scenes. Compliments to the actors and staff for making a film instead of just a porn movie. This lack of story however allows me to concentrate on the characters' actions and body language more.Therefore I feel like I know the characters more than in lots of other films (especially blockbusters.)

If you are interested in movies, watch this movie once.Most of the dialogue is improv. thats cool. Unfortunately, the film is rather boring. the sex is real. thats sexy (and unique, therefore worth considering).Is it porno? perhaps...nope...but if it is, then 9 Songs is unquestionably the best porno film ever made, bar none. Seriously.But 9 Songs is not pornography. Heres why: For me, the film managed to capture something beautiful. It really showed the raw nature of a relationship based largely on sexuality and a deep physical connection. It showed what love can be, in its most primal and painful form...and through their sex, the characters were presented expressively. Moreover, pornography is made to help people get off. This film will not help much with that, unless you are very desperate for some alone time. This film may instead trigger deep personal memories of past lovers and the smell of their hair and the way they felt under silk sheets.This film hit me hard. It is so easy to lose all control over love, especially when its so physical and so intense, like a drug more addictive then crack, and with no comedown...until your system adapts to the drug, and it wares off. but even then, it will have changed your system forever...kinda...? they caught that. it was beautiful.Then again, maybe its just really really good porno.",9 Songs
162,roburado-1,I have been waiting for a film like this.,8,12 November 2007,"I have been waiting for a movie like this. I have wondered why romance movies are often romantic comedies. Why not a movie about a love affair without plot twists? Why not a movie with just love and lust as they happen in real life with all their little successes and failures? I enjoyed this movie for giving me those things. There is an honesty about this film. It is not stylized. It is not over-dramatized. It is the story of a love affair as real love affairs happen. The movie felt very real to me.I think it was interesting to tell the story of the love affair mainly through the actions of the characters rather than through their dialogue. Often, as I have remembered the events of my own relationships, snippets of dialogue, actions, pivotal moments where I should have seen the structure of the relationship crumbling, etc., they play like this movie. I remember the places we ate, cooking and eating the meals we made, trips we took, things the women said, and I looked at those relationships noting the great memories and the points of failure. I remember warning signs that I ignored much like the warning signs ignored by the male protagonist. This movie is constructed like those memories and reminiscences. My memories have no strong narrative. Neither does this movie. To me, it was fascinating to structure a movie this way. Michael Winterbottom did a great job of editing together his footage to create this movie. I thought it was great that the male character was nearly oblivious to the warning signs--some subtle, some not so subtle. I thought the movie was beautifully crafted.I like that there was no script. I like that dialogue was largely improvised. I like that the dialogue was mundane. Often, relationships are like that. Real relationships don't have exposition. Real relationships are full of banality. Sometimes, the mundane details of people's days are all that are discussed. I appreciated that the dialogue just sounded like two real people. Much has been made of the explicit depiction of the couple's sex. I found it refreshingly honest. I thank the actors and the filmmakers for that.The only parts I didn't enjoy were most of the concert footage. For me, that's a matter of taste. Most of the music in the movie is not really my kind of music. It doesn't have to be. After all, it's about the two characters and what they like. I found myself fast-forwarding through the music, but I watched the characters' interaction. If they weren't on screen, I fast-forwarded quickly. If they were on screen I slowed down--sometimes to regular speed. If they were on screen dancing, enjoying the music, I fast-forwarded slowly. For me, the concert footage did not add appreciably to the love story. So, I didn't bother paying much attention to it. To me, the important part was the relationship.Overall, I enjoyed this movie. I will probably own it at some point.",9 Songs
163,odetolalexis,A tender private little film that speaks about love through their dynamic domestic life,7,20 December 2010,"Yes the sex scenes were ""all over the place"" in this film but there was a sense of tenderness and honesty in them. And there were also those wonderful rock'n'roll concerts and Antarctica scene (something about a nightmare to people who are claustrophobic or its polar opposite agoraphobic which I think also symbolic of those indoor concerts and their domestic life). Snippets from the movie touched me to some extent, I guess, as if I've got the know them so much within merely some sixty-seven minutes.All in all, the story progressed smoothly and people would either be drawn to its atmosphere/vibe and the male lead's take on their relationship or turned off and confused by those ubiquitous sex activity and a seemingly simplistic plot.Not sure if the movie would be better with or without the real sex scenes though. Without them we couldn't see the gentleness from the British boyfriend during their most private activities. Interestingly, we saw the reversal of gender norm/dynamics that we usually see in porn in that it was the woman demanding the way she'd like and the man followed her demand.In fact, I think the boyfriend had done everything a woman can ask from a man, like he cooked for her twice and yet she none, and when she was so deeply down he remained patient with her instead of walking away. The only time he walked away was when the woman getting a strip dance, obviously aroused by the dancer in the club.OTHO, I'm surprised to see some posters would rather talk about peripheral mechanical technicalities, outliers, or speculation than the way the man and woman interacted and how they departed.",9 Songs

It cannot be a porn movie as it is not intended to be one. Nonetheless, it shows enough to be one. The music is very good throughout the whole film, which is actually a succession of sexual scenes and gigs (some the best Brit pop around now), but not good enough, though, to make the film a masterpiece. In a word, it's a good movie about what a relationship can be (in its sexual dimension and beyond)- or even should be ? It's all about life, and that's what cinema is all about.",9 Songs
165,floated,Excellent Portrayal of a Bad Relationship,8,11 June 2005,"9 Songs follows a year of time in a couple's lives. You'd never know it was a year though, because their relationship feels like something that's only been occurring for a few months. I would know, I've been in the exact relationship depicted in the movie, with the notable absence of constant trips to live concerts of awesome bands.This movie follows a basic pattern: 1.) Brief clip of couple doing something together, that usually never involves conversation or any sort of actual mutual bonding. 2.) Longer, yet still brief, clip of couple having explicit sex, and when I say explicit, you actually see penetration, oral sex, etc. 3.) At least half a song performed live by a band in concert. 3.) More footage of couple having sex. 4.) The male lead talks some nonsense about Antarctica being cold and desolate. 5.) Return to step 1 and repeat indefinitely until end of film.Honestly, the more I think about the movie, the more I realize it achieved probably exactly what it set out to do, which is an immense achievement that would be unfair of me to play down in anyway. Especially considering that you're dealing with two actors who apparently have no chemistry, but maybe that's the point.What 9 Songs accurate portrays is a relationship that shouldn't exist, but unfortunately seems to be the most common. The two leads, Matt and Lisa, are a couple who's lives revolve mostly around sensuous pleasure. It would be wrong to say the film effectively neuters all potential character development, because the characters can't develop in the situation they're in.They are in a relationship that strictly revolves around sex and good times, and they don't even realize it. This is easily shown by the fact that every time they are shown having a good time together, neither of them are speaking, and when one of them finally does speak, it's about something entirely inconsequential that the other isn't interested in at all. When they finally do mutually converse, it ends up in a pseudo-fight where Lisa ends up yelling at a nonchalant Matt who just shuts down because he doesn't care enough.Matt is the center of the film, as all the introspection, what little of it there is, comes from him. He speaks of Lisa as if she was just a typical girl, walking in and out of his life, just using him, even before we know it ourselves. He seems to know that it's true through the whole relationship, but still gets tied up in it. In fact, the only time she shows any actual selfless sexual attention to Matt is the last time they're together before she leaves him to fly to America for a year.Aside from that one isolated incident, it's always Matt who gives himself up in the sexual situations, and there are many of them. Generally they involve Matt doing various things to Lisa, who is a willing receiver. Often they open up with him going down on her, or tying her up and going down on her, or caressing her body. Rarely, except for the one occasion, is she ever doing anything to him. ""Fuck me,"" she says. ""Fuck me, now."" Something everyone is probably familiar with, but in the context of the film it speaks volumes about their relationship.I hate to get all psycho-analytical on a film that I actually didn't think was very good, but honestly the fact is that 9 Songs is probably the best sexual explicit ""mainstream"" movie ever made, and will probably be the only one. 9 Songs actually uses full exposure sex to accurately portray a relationship. The sex never feels like it's just for show, because it's not attractive enough to be considered superfluous. The sex is realistic, usually unattractive in its realism, and shows what their relationship is like. It works beautifully within the context of the movie and you have to applaud the creative forces behind the movie for having the courage to make it, and to do it so well.But, would I recommend the film to others? I don't know. I would say no, but technically the film is only an hour long, and it's worth it just to see an accurate portrayal of a shitty relationship, if not only as a curiosity. 9 Songs isn't a good movie, but it such an excellently composed bad movie that it's pretty much worth seeing.",9 Songs
166,phalonia,"Not pornography, though hardly a film either",4,15 July 2007,"9 Songs takes what has appeared increasingly in films for the last twenty years and pushed it one step farther. It is not unusual to find a film with some sort of sex scene in it, in fact for some romance films in the modern climate it is very nearly a requirement. 9 Songs has taken this trend and put it in the fast lane by filming real sex in a believable way.The story itself is basic, charting the relationship of a young couple over the course of a year. Unfortunately the ""story"" basically consists of them visiting various musical concerts, some very banal conversation that is obviously improvised and prolific scenes of explicit sex. Be under no mistake, the films takes great care to leave no doubt in your mind that any of it could have been faked, however those who would draw comparisons to pornography are quite mistaken.Whilst the similarities are obvious, as porn does seek to show on film explicit sexual activity, that is where the similarity ends. Pornography often uses over-perfect women and men with bodies like Greek gods, featuring positions and performances that are male-orientated and designed to emphasise male sexual dominance. 9 Songs uses a female lead who is very thin to the point of being quite scrawny, a far cry from the voluptuous figures seek on mainstream pornography, whilst the male lead is hardly laden with muscles. The sex too is meant to be more representational of a real couples sex life. Do not expect sex scenes where the couple is on an unrealistically large bed, changing positions every two minutes before finishing with the trademark ""facial"". Rather the sex can be seen to be what a couple would really do, sex enjoyable for both parties and showing that it is not just an act to satisfy the man.That aside there is very little else to the film.

In short, it tells the story of two of the dullest, most shallow characters cinema has ever seen, who meet at a rock concert and have sex. That's it. In actual fact, nothing else happens. The dialog is scant. What manages to get said between the two characters is pretty crap. I will admit, maybe I missed something. Maybe there is some deeper underlying meaning to the whole film.

168,jonlawrence99,"Really though, why?",1,15 March 2005,"OK, unfortunately I've got nothing to add of particular consequence but I'd like to echo the opinion that this film is truly awful. The idea of something a bit different, with a good soundtrack alerted me to go and see this. I ignored all the press of 'controversial' and 'explicit' and gave it a chance. I cannot believe I bothered. Three people walked out during the film, as would I if i hadn't had to sit in close proximity to an old guy who had been flicking through porn magazines before it started wasn't 'spread out' blocking my aisle.Firstly, there's no storyline. Two people who appear to meet at a BRMC show (I can only assume) in London (poorly recorded thus making the track almost unlistenable) do very little but have sex continuously, segued with token indie fodder between bouts. I felt pretty nauseous after 45 mins, it was just the same thing over and over again. It's no more 'credible' than an amateur porn flick, and to try and add depth with the whole Antarctic sequences was just trying to differentiate something that was long lost. Winterbottom could have gone for the porn film, or lumped the rarely seen live footage as part of a cheap 'indier than thou' DVD, but throwing them together so haphazardly (the live shows are almost laughable...we occasionally see the couple bopping along to the song) is pure tedium. There's nothing to clinch from this film at all, a totally wasted afternoon sat near to frankly, old perverts, has taught me a lesson.",9 Songs
169,EBGB,I've seen porn with more substance.,1,16 March 2005,"Worst film I've ever seen. Truly, truly dire. Best performance goes to the Antarctic, as does most attractive cast member. He's hopeless, she's worse. Redeeming features: the length (69 minutes, tells you everything you need to know), and there was quite a nice little short preceding it at my local cinema. Plus I've got a season ticket, so didn't actively throw away the price of a ticket.WHY are these people together? WHAT is the point? To be fair, Kieran O'Brien seems to be trying to put in a performance, but he's unbelievable as a geologist, and is completely hobbled by a script which seems to have been an afterthought. There's so little focus on their lives outside music & shagging that it would have made more sense to leave it out altogether & make the film totally claustrophobic. I ought to try to give Margot Stilley the benefit of the doubt as a newcomer, but hell, she's so lacking in charm, I don't see why I should bother. The only sexual chemistry to sidle onto the screen is when she's watching the lap dancer, and even then it's pretty limited.For all those who think I'm underwhelmed because I don't get it enough, think again. Yup, of course there was an element of prurience that made me want to see it; the same goes for everyone who's seen or is considering seeing this film. But believe me, the sex is disappointing because it's DULL.Maybe it's my own fault for not taking the review I saw listing the bands as a warning; the music's not much to my taste at all. But as someone else pointed out, maybe it's because I was expecting too much in the way of story / script / acting.OK, so some relationships are utterly closed in and pointless. But I can watch TV to get a fix of that. This was supposed to be a quality bit of film-making by a decent director, or so I thought. This ain't art, it's pretentious would-be titillating drivel.You want over the top rumpo? See ""In the Realm of the Senses"". Quality male nudity? Ewan MacGregor in ""The Pillow Book"", or Vincent Perez in ""La Reine Margot"". A relationship based on sex? ""Betty Blue"".

172,theb-girl,It fails as a porn film and it fails as an art film.,1,25 May 2005,"Well, I allowed myself to be persuaded to see Nine Songs last night. It's difficult to express how truly boring and crappy it is, but I'll try. If condoms and coloured lights were the signature items in Tropfest, this thing wouldn't make it past the first round.I could tell it was an art film, rather than a porn film, because the sex scenes were horribly boring and unimaginatively shot. Most of the film is appallingly dark, so perhaps there are more exciting thing happening in the shadows, but who would know? Since I haven't seen Paris Hilton's sex video, I asked the guy I was with to compare it and he reported that Hilton's effort was better lit and better framed. Oh, and most porn flicks seem to have at least some semblance of a plot. As a porn film, it fails.The idea for Nine Songs is an interesting one. To reflect on a relationship by examining only a couple of aspects of it. Namely, the sex and the concerts the people go to but with absolutely no character development, it fails miserably as an art film. In fact, I'm not sure I could even go as far as saying the two people actually had personalities at all. The only way I knew they were characters was that the actors had different names from them according to the closing credits.The concert scenes looked as thought they had been shot from the cheapest seats in the house on some fan's mobile phone camera and I think Winterbottom needs to seriously consider investing in a tripod. If I was in one of the bands filmed and then saw the results of them filming my live performance, I'd seriously consider withdrawing my permission to use the footage. Every concert these people went to looked exactly the same as every other one.The scenes in the Antarctic looked like they had been liberated from the stock footage vault at the BBC. And frankly, if all I could remember of a relationship while I was in the Antarctic was sex as mediocre as it is in this film, I'd consider myself well out of there.I cannot sum up this film better than my companion from last night who said that this is the film you'd get if you gave Ed Wood some home video footage of some concerts and a second year film student's cheap attempt at an arty porn flick and told him to make a feature length film from it. And then he found some leftover reels from a documentary on the Antarctic in his basement tie it all together with.If you want to see a porn film with a plot, see Debbie Does Dallas.

173,simon1111479,9 Songs - should have been 3,1,15 April 2005,"9 Songs begins on the polar icecaps with Matt gazing out of the window of an aircraft. Down below the barren landscape seems to reflect his own inner thoughts and emotions as he begins to tell us about Lisa, the girl with whom he has been sharing his life. She is an American studying in London. He is a glaciologist spending his time digging up plugs of ice on Antarctica.All too suddenly the film cuts to Matt's grimy flat in Brixton, and a moderately graphic scene of seemingly loving sex between him and Lisa. Then, the couple is standing in the Brixton Academy, being entertained by a band on stage. Then Matt is back on Antarctica then shagging again, and then back in the Academy watching another guitar band peddle their wares.Unfortunately, by the time this sequence played out for the fifth time, and other than the sex becoming, rather benignly, sado-mashochistic and the bands sounding increasingly alike, the storyline had progressed no further and the harsh chair got the better of me. Along with my boredom I gathered my coat and left the cinema.It is interesting that Michael Winterbottom (a filmmaker I respect) makes the comment in interview that he is less bothered with the notion of the arc of storytelling than he is with the idea that each scene of a film should be somehow correct. That eventually, in the climax of the film, all scenes should add up and make for something that is both entertaining and dramatically valid. After the dismal failure of 9 Songs to do either, this may be one view the filmmaker would consider revising.A film that relies on little more than the monotony of crosscutting performances of bands at the Brixton Academy with scenes of moderately graphic sex in ever differing places is not really a film at all. And essentially this is all, 9 Songs does. At best, it is a licentious, bland historical record of the south-east London Zone 2 zeitgeist, and may find its way into the DVD collections of those who hanker after the sort of music that Winterbottom seems best at home with. At worst it is a cheap skin flick, poorly filmed, better served in 3 songs.It is impossible to empathise with the doomed lovers as the inevitable conflict enters their lives. Theirs are characters wholly unexplored and therefore left bereft of our sympathy. The filmmaker's defence on this count might be his obvious and seeming desire to repudiate characterisation. Or the renouncing of conventional storytelling, whatever conventional storytelling may be in favour of a new form that somehow invents fresh genres, an art-house statement perhaps, one that explores like its protagonist, uninhabited territory.The problem with 9 Songs, however, is not its interrogation of genre it is its reluctance to explore its own story and character's lives.We are left thinking, ""So what?"" cold and empty as fossils frozen in the polar icecaps as Matt's proclamation of love is unrequited. ""Who cares?"" when Lisa ridicules his sunglasses. ""Give me a break"" when she clasps his erect penis between her toes whilst the two soak in the bath. Of course, there is a philosophical argument that says this very well may be what the director wants us to think: sex, rock and roll and burrowing in the ice caps leads to a place where the landscape is harsh and all emotions are bleak and empty. But without the delicate perspective that has made other films of a similar nature substantial, authoritative and even great, is it correct that the public, paying to stick bums on seats should do so only to be reminded of what life, at its most base and unchallenged, is really like?Powerful stories work because they say what they need to without speaking. It is written in the subtext. 9 Songs sets itself up as an interesting prospect but quickly descends into a dull, unenthusiastic excursion, that turns lethargically between bland sex and, sometimes, blander music. If Michael Winterbottom can be credited with anything it is fooling the British Board of Film Censors into agreeing that 9 Songs is art and that the two differing genres, porn and music, conspire to make it so. Nevertheless, the filmmaker still must deal with this conundrum; a piece of work which leaves one philosophising on its why and wherefore, in an attempt to justify its existence, skates on thin ice. It may be fare to pitch 9 Songs as art and it is true to say that art does not and indeed, should not conform. But art does have a remit; like narcotics it should work.There are films that have broached the duality of graphic sexuality with that of emotion in an atmosphere that was both fleeting and mundane; ""Last Tango in Paris"" is to name but one. Last Tango in Paris succeeded because Bernardo Bertolucci, in his grace, was considerate enough to reel out just enough information about Paul and Jeanne's exterior lives in order for us to bridge the gap between our own perspective and that of their passionate, yet fundamentally abusive time together. With this knowledge we are able to not only empathise with their plight but measure it in feeling too. Therefore, what on the outset seems a terribly simple and sometimes vulgar story becomes, by virtue of the depth of its characters, a complex and beautifully woven exposition of the human condition. It is bleak, nihilistic and doomed but what Last Tango in Paris lacks in outlook it more than makes up for in spirit. By contrast, 9 Songs is a stark reminder of the rocky road the clever concoction of genre without the manufacture of classical story must travel. Perhaps it is an academic view, but with only the sex and rock and roll, minus the drugs, 9 Songs has nowhere left to go.",9 Songs
174,m-gsl,Excellent and beautiful.,9,17 May 2005,"Do you occasionally expose yourself to contemporary art? Such an experience touches me at a deeper level if I put aside questions like ""What's the artists intention?"" or ""What was the cultural or political motivation for his/her work?"" Approaching contemporary art from a more intuitive point of view, paying less attention to the analytical side of my brain and more to how a piece of art makes me feel is usually a rewarding strategy.With ""Nine Songs"", I follow a similar approach. I don't care where and why the two main characters met, and why their relationship didn't last, neither do I want to know about all the aspects of their personalities the movie doesn't reveal to us. The film shows us very real, snapshot-like scenes of a relationship.Contrary to other reviewers I believe the character development was excellent. It was not Winterbottom's intention to create an analytical piece of work that illustrates in detail every part of its characters' psyches. What we get to see is the dynamics between two young, sexually very much attracted people, and as such, the play is dense and convincing. It is my opinion that especially Margo Stilley achieves a very authentic performance in her portray of a girl whose emotional state sways between crazy excitement, lightheartedness, sadness, and destructiveness. Confirmation for this unstable aspect of her personality I see in the fact that she is supposed to ""take one little pill a day"".I would like to respond to philconcannon's statement. Quote: >> ""The two actors are unconvincing and the heavily-improvised dialogue is utterly dismal (sample conversation: ""Those glasses look stupid"" ""I'm trying to look stupid"", ""They look ugly"" ""I'm trying to look ugly""). << Well, I don't know about philconcannon's experiences with relationships, but I consider it likely that a couple in their early twenties doesn't constantly reflect the seriousness of life in their verbal communication. It's the kind of mundane exchange probably most of us have repeatedly experienced, for example (as it is the case in the movie) during a long and boring drive. A similar dialog takes place later in the movie, when Margo Stilley again provokes Kieran O'Brien by telling him that he looks stupid. Maybe the women is going through a PMS cycle, maybe she is sad and tries to escape her inner self by getting into an argument with her boyfriend. Whatever reasons there might be for this exchange, I believe that it quite well reflects the reality of their relationship and their characters, and therefore the dialog adds to the authenticity of the movie.In regard to the explicit sexuality shown in this movie: When was, for the first time in movie history, French kissing shown on screen? I'm sure that caused a minor uproar at the time, considering that people were used to seeing very sterile, unreal ""lips firmly pressed on lips"" kisses. Sexuality is a big part of our lives and I give Winterbottom a lot of credit for the fact that he portrayed it as what it is. He didn't try to design the actual encounters as shocking or unusual as possible. Frankly, I think many of the scenes were in spite of their explicit depiction wonderful to watch and even romantic. A definite advancement compared to the high gloss, fake sexuality we are presented with in Hollywood blockbusters like ""Basic Instinct"".One last thought in response to cedric owl's comment, who quotes Winterbottom saying: ""I wanted to make a film with ****ing in it."" Well, here is a more accurate description of what Winterbottom really said: I asked myself, why is it not possible to show sex in cinema? What is wrong with it? Not only do people want to have sex in their own lives  it is also an openly presented subject in art. No question it is not a taboo. There is a very free depiction of sexuality in contemporary literature, the newspapers are full of it, and so is TV.  So, why not (in cinema)?  Many people considered it a bad idea right from the beginning. With explicit sex, it has to result in a porn movie. I asked myself: Actually, why? How can we avoid turning it into pornography? And the other way round: How is it possible at all to tell a true love story if something as essential as sex is kept out? So we started by trying to find a frame, to develop a story that is interesting, but at the same time as simple as possible.""",9 Songs
175,foxandhisfriends-1,Sappy and Overtly poetic piece of dull Sex cinema,4,29 July 2005,"The main problem with Winterbottom's film is that it's SO DAMN PRESCIOUS! Naked lovers screwing, reading Michel Houellebecq's Platform to contemplative piano score. Also, unlike CineSex peers Breillat or Patrice Chereau, Winterbottom stays exclusively heterosexual male in approaching his lovers, exposing (and cinematographically flattering) the female lead but keeping us completely ignorant to the male, except, of course, to illustrate his giant penis (and thus his masculinity). Eating her out in poetically forensic closeups and squeezing her nipples are the meat here (excuse the pun) certainly not the dialog, which introduces a few interesting discussions, only to forfeit them but moments later for another ""sex fest."" (apparently on IMDb I am not allowed to use the F word. God Forbid!) Most of the time, the vocal interjections are just to make the female lead look ""cute"" or ""wild,"" but it just makes her look stupid. In addition, you get the impression that Winterbottom is just a little too old for the subject matter. Worshipping 5 minute bands that have already all but disappeared in the amount of time that it took for the film to get United States distribution. He gazes at our couple with the affection of a jealous third wheel. He brings up little in the film, try as he may by introducing (in what may be one of the most appallingly blatant metaphoric voice over this year) the parallel of Antarctica to his girl. Because when our male is not f***ing his female every five seconds without ever stopping to ask, 'how was your day, sweetie,' he is analyzing ice core samples from Antarctica (or at least he does at one point. And you can feel that that point was chosen in the editing bay, as Winterbottom said to himself, ""Gee, maybe the audience will get sick of them f***ing."") We do. But dialog like this does not make it any better. Now I am not reacting to the sex, mind you. Most films that use real sexual encounters start off on a good foot in my mind, simply because they have the nerve to do so. The video quality is, at times, rapturous. Again, only when it is flattering our female. One also gets the impression that Winterbottom does not fully know what he is talking about. A S&M scene is dull enough to make Sascher Masoch yawn. Add in very blatant references (like Michel Houellebecq) and it feels like Winterbottom said, ""Gee, maybe I'll make a sex movie now.""",9 Songs

However is it OK to ask actors to have rather than fake sex for a film? The consequences of this becoming the 'norm' would be that actors would be expected to have sex to make movies. Is this too much to ask? What about possibility of contracting STDs, personal standards of morality, actors real life partners thoughts on this? Does this movie reflect loosening of sexual morality in society (i.e. normal for people to sleep casually with others who they are not in relationships with (the actors not the characters))?When does acting stop being acting and start being reality?

When directors integrate bands into a film in a seamless way, such as with Nick Cave in Wings of Desire, the result can be glorious for those of us who enjoy music. The director of this film though couldn't seem to decide if the movie was to be either a video of band footage or a porno--unfortunately it was good at neither.

This movie portrayed sex like many people have in their own homes; raw, un-coached sex.

I think that's what makes the movie fail as entertainment: everybody watching the movie is forced to deal with whether they're comfortable with seeing explicit, real sex on screen, and isn't thinking about whether they like the movie or not. It makes for an interesting discussion, but not a worthwhile cinematic experience.Oh well. I got one good thing out of it: I'd never heard ""C'mon C'mon"" by the Von Bondies before, and I discovered that I like that song. For me, that meant that my $4 was not a waste of money.",9 Songs
189,karenrothman,Being a fly on the wall while two people explore the youthful extremes of love,10,20 February 2006,"I didn't know a thing about 9 songs when I rented it. It was so brilliantly acted, I thought the only way this could have been done was if the two leads were lovers and they directed the film. But no, this is real ....sex that is....the actors portray first love in the most truthful light I've ever seen. The fact that there was no script adds to the realism of the film. Both actors give their hearts and souls to this film. Director Michael Winterbottom's idea is genius. In an industry where everything is becoming increasingly ""false"" Winterbottom brings the epitome of realism back to the camera. Anyone who has a problem with this film is probably just upset that they never felt the way these two people felt. My only question is, is this considered pornography? I haven't looked up the definition lately, and frankly I don't care if it were but the film definitely pushed the envelope in a society that is increasingly right wing.",9 Songs
190,fyhyrio,This is porn.,1,6 March 2006,"The only thing that separates this movie from a xxx rated porn movie is the camera/film quality. There are two things in this movie...#1 being 9 songs. #2 blatant sex scenes showing everything in close detail, including ejaculations.How the reviewer could ever call this art, is a myth to me. How could this be determined to be art? -because it shows bits of poorly shot songs in a live setting? -because in some scenes it shows more people than the actual partakers of the sex scenes? I knew nothing of the film before seeing it. Completely random viewing. And it goes like this...Scenes: music - sex - music - sex - music - sex - music - sex - music - sex - music - sex - music - sex - music - sex - music = The End. All of about 15 minutes of the entire film includes before/after sex talk, arguing or doing drugs.My advice: If you like to see blatant sex in films... visit your local porn shop, as you'll be spared the 9 songs and 15 minutes of nonsense.. If however, you like artsy films with some sort of a plot or at least messages hidden about... try a David Lynch film or something of the like.",9 Songs
191,evilrockbass,Excellent movie for the fully formed adult viewer,10,14 March 2006,"An awful lot of reviews of this movie state that there is no story, just sex and music.Seriously, just because a story is low-key, not spelled out for you, and contains no explosions or last minute twist endings, does not make it less of a story. Just one for adults with more than 5 minutes of attention span (or an appreciation of subtlety). I have had relationships like this. Friendly, warm and sensual to start. More intense and a bit unpredictable as it develops. And then the sudden ending as someone loses interest (or finds a greater interest in work or life somewhere else). If your a music fan who has ever fallen in love with another music lover, this is the film for you.",9 Songs
