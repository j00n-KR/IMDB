0,TheLittleSongbird,Home of fear,7,1 January 2019,"Having been on a roll watching and reviewing gradually over time films belonging in horror film franchises, the Chucky/'Child's Play' films were the most recent to get this treatment. Part of my want to see them was my fascination to see if killer doll Chucky deserved his horror icon status. My conclusion seeing the films is that he does deserve it and a hugely entertaining and creepy character, that is quite a bit better than the films.The 'Child's Play'/Chucky films vary in quality, some decent to good, others not so good. Don't consider any of them unwatchable though. 'Curse of Chucky' is one of the good ones despite its faults, not a film that blew me away and will never be a favourite but it both scared and entertained me, as the main objective for the franchise that is a very good thing. As far as the 'Child's Play'/Chucky films go, the best will always be the first one. 'Curse of Chucky', for me and quite a number of others, is though one of the best of the series. Would go as far to say that it beats 'Bride of Chucky' as the best since the first and it vastly improves on the disappointing 'Seed of Chucky' which along with 'Child's Play 3' is my least favourite.Really appreciated that 'Curse of Chucky' returned to its roots and the closest of the sequels to capture the tone of the first film. Although there may not be an awful lot of surprises in the surprises, this return gave the sense that the franchise had been revived and been brought new overdue life. There is far more of a reliance on horror, and genuinely scary and suspenseful horror film, than the comedic approach adopted by most of the sequels, which varied greatly. The opening sequence is truly foreboding and the kills are imaginative, gloriously gory and freaky, without veering on being too tasteless.Yet 'Curse of Chucky' doesn't take itself too seriously as a result, the wickedly funny one-liners and dialogue remain still. Chucky is as frightening and entertaining as ever, plus used much more and better than he was in 'Seed of Chucky' and Nica is a likeable protagonist that one roots for. Brad Dourif continues to voice Chucky with relish and his daughter Fiona is both cute and spirited. The film looks great, very stylish and haunting with terrific effects, even in the lesser films the production values were always among the good things. The music is suitably eerie and the direction is skilful.Not that 'Curse of Chucky' is perfect, but the good things far outweigh the cons. The rest of the cast are on the bland side. There are pacing issues here and there, momentum does sag.The ending felt anti-climactic and rushed.Otherwise, pretty good and one of the best in the series. 7/10 Bethany Cox",Curse of Chucky
1,Leofwine_draca,Seen it all before,4,25 February 2018,"I saw CURSE OF CHUCKY getting positive reviews on here but I have no idea why. I appreciate that the series went back to its serious horror roots after the inanity of SEED OF CHUCKY, but instead this just plays out as a typical slow-paced horror flick set in one of those gloomy old mansions. Fiona Dourif, daughter of Brad, plays the wheelchair-bound lead, but the plot quickly descends into tedium after the well-written opening sequence. An unlikeable cast of characters are eventually bumped off in cheap gruesome ways while Chucky is his usual wisecracking killer self. The whole thing feels like a pale imitation of the original trilogy but there really is nothing new to see here.",Curse of Chucky
2,SnoopyStyle,much better than expected,7,30 October 2017,"Nica is disabled since birth living with her overbearing mother. They are surprised with a delivery of a Chucky doll. The mother dies mysteriously and is ruled a suicide. Nica's sister Barb arrives to care for her. She brings along her husband Ian, daughter Alice, and au pair Jill. With money trouble, Barb wants to sell the house for her half of the inheritance. Alice finds Chucky and immediately takes to him. Father Frank joins them for dinner and gets poisoned by Chucky. The poison kicks in and he's decapitated in a car crash. Officer Stanton investigates.This is straight to VOD. It has a stripped down horror house aspect and it's surprisingly good. It's more cinematic than it deserves to be. The house has a nice creepy look. The camera takes interesting shots with good creepy closeups especially with Chucky. Chucky alumni Don Mancini gets most of the credit. He's not only writing but also directing this one. There isn't much exposition and there isn't much need for it. It's a bunch of people in a house with the killer doll and they don't know it. There are nice little twists. It's simple and it works. It's almost classic in its execution.",Curse of Chucky
3,claudio_carvalho,Play with This!,7,14 October 2013,"The depressed Sarah (Chantal Quesnelle) lives with her disabled daughter Nica (Fiona Dourif), who is stuck in a wheelchair since she was born, in an isolated old house. Sarah receives a package with the creepy red- haired doll Chucky and she throws it in the garbage. But during the night she is found dead and Chucky is sat on a chair in the living room. Nica's sister Barb (Danielle Bisutti) attends the funeral with her estranged husband Ian (Brennan Elliott); their little daughter Alice (Summer Howell); the nanny Jill (Maitland McConnell) and her friend Father Frank (A Martinez). Along the night, there are mysterious deaths and Nica discovers that the package was sent from the evidence depositary. She also researches the Internet and suspects that Chucky might be behind the murders. ""Curse of Chucky"" is a great return of the franchise with a sinister history of Chucky. The cinematography and the camera work are top-notch and the plot is well developed. Wait until the end of the credits since the movie continues with a long scene; in the end, ""play with this""! My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): ""A Maldição de Chucky"" (""The Curse of Chucky"")",Curse of Chucky
4,nogodnomasters,Friend to the end,10,23 March 2018,"Nica (Fiona Dourif) who is bound to a wheelchair gets a Chucky Doll in the mail. After her mother is gone, her controlling sister Barb (Danielle Bisutti) comes with her family to comfort Nica. This includes the Nanny (Maitland McConnell) a Denise Richards looking nymph you pray doesn't die before she can take a shower. The film adds some nice touches by starring Fiona Dourif, the daughter of Brad Dourif who is Chucky's voice. The throw back to Jennifer Tilly was a bonus.In case you forgot the Chucky story, he rehashes it. This is a straight forward Chucky film which includes blood squirts, puns, and of course a doll with a knife.Must see for fans of the franchise, a fitting sequel.Parental Guide: F-bombs. No sex or nudity. Maitland in red bra and panties.",Curse of Chucky
5,kosmasp,I can't hide it,8,27 October 2013,"I am really excited, especially because this is a major improvement to the recent output of Chucky movies. This really hits the spot or mark or whatever you want to call it. Unrated version should be the one to watch obviously. The movie might not have many surprises plot wise (you know the drill, no pun intended), but it has one very funny revealing that ignited a lot of hooting in the cinema. And deservedly so! It might be gender based hollering though.Whatever the case, the lead actress is the daughter of ... the voice of Chucky! Which is a very strange thing to do and play as you can imagine. Something she revealed in the Q&A after the movie was presented too. Very convincing, as is everyone else in the movie. There was not a moment where I felt not entertained. So I might have given the movie a point to much (a 7 would be more appropriate), but that is what happens, when a movie defies expectations and is actually exactly what it should be",Curse of Chucky
6,jboothmillard,Curse of Chucky,6,5 November 2014,"The Child's Play series has had its up and downs over the last twenty five years, this sixth entry in the series may not have been released in the cinemas, and I was perhaps skeptical, but I was still going to watch, directed by creator of the killer doll, Don Mancini (Seed of Chucky). Basically it has been four years since the events of the last film, at the Pierce family home, where paraplegic Nica (Fiona Dourif, Brad's daughter) lives with her mother Sarah (Chantal Quesnelle), Good Guy doll Chucky (Brad Dourif) arrives in the mail, later that night Sarah is found dead after a stab wound, her death is assumed to be suicide. The next day Nica's sister Barbie 'Barb' (Danielle Bisutti), accompanied by her husband Ian (Brennan Elliott) and their daughter Alice (Summer H. Howell), live-in nanny Jill (Maitland McConnell) and priest Father Frank (A Martinez) arrive, Alice finds Chucky and keeps him. Chili is cooked for dinner by Alice and Nica, rat poison is secretly poured into one of the bowls by Chucky, Father Frank is the one who eats the poison, after leaving the house he is decapitated in a car crash, before he left he mentioned recognising the doll, possibly from news reports, Nica curious searches the Internet, and she finds articles about unsolved Chucky murders, and a link to serial killer Charles Lee Ray, aka The Lakeshore Strangler. During the night Chucky sneaks out of Alice's bed and electrocutes Jill to death using a bucket of dripping rain water and ground power outlets, this causes a blackout, and next Barb goes to check on Alice, seeing Chucky on the stairs she assumes Alice is in the attic, up there Barb finds Chucky again, she notices a dent on his face, slowly she peels fake plastic to reveal his facial scars, then he comes to life to killed her with a kitchen knife. Nica realises the danger and with the elevator out of orders attempts to crawl upstairs, Barb is already dead and Chucky reveals himself to Nica, she wakes Ian who who takes her to the garage before going back to find Alice, but Chucky is there to start the car and attempt to kill her with monoxide poisoning. Ian returns and accuses Nica of the murders, he looks back at footage he recorded with a secret camera placed on Chucky, he was trying to catch Barb's affair with Jill, he realises Chucky is alive, but before he can do anything he is killed with a hatchet, she breaks out from her restraints and detaches Chucky's head with the hatchet, but he is still alive and reattaches his head, pushing Nica over the balcony she falls to the ground floor. She asks Chucky why he is doing this, through flashbacks Chucky explains that a long time ago he was a friend of the family and in love with Sarah, while she was heavily pregnant he kidnapped her and killed Nica's father, Sarah betrayed Chucky and called the police, he stabbed her in stomach, meaning baby Nica was born paraplegic, the run from the police led to his death as a human, setting off the events that have happened since, Chucky came back to Sarah for revenge. Nica and Chucky have a scuffle after she taunts him and he tries to finish killing her, the power is restored and a police officer soon arrives at the house, he sees Barb's body upstairs and Nica holding a bloody knife, Chucky remains still, she is seen on trial, found of guilty of the murders, and sent to an insane asylum, Chucky is there as an exhibit in the case, he taunts him again. Chucky is taken in a plastic bag by the arresting officer to be delivered to an unknown person, it is Tiffany (Jennifer Tilly), who slits his throat, she is the one who mails Chucky to his next victim, Alice, who is some time later living with her grandmother, he persuades her to play the game ""Hide the Soul"", chanting to try and transfer his soul into her body, and at that moment the grandmother appears with a plastic bag over her head, Chucky tried to asphyxiate her. The last scene, after the credits have rolled, sees adult Andy Barclay (Child Play's Alex Vincent) receiving a package delivery, he turns his head to answer the phone to his mother, Chucky cuts his way out of the package with a knife, but Andy anticipated his arrival, he holds a shotgun and says ""Play with this"", before pulling the trigger. Bride of... and Seed of... brought to the series a fun horror spoof aspect, this one returns to the series routes, being eerie, with Dourif still remaining the great nasty possessed toy with the one-liners, and the bloody deaths are still inventive, it is a surprisingly satisfactory horror film. Good!",Curse of Chucky
7,BA_Harrison,A change in style for Chucky.,8,9 April 2014,"I reckon I enjoyed the previous Child's Play movie, Seed of Chucky, more than most, largely thanks to the completely bats**t bonkers approach, and I would loved to have seen the series continue in this vein; however, those behind the franchise clearly felt that a change was in order, because Curse of Chucky, the latest in the series, sees a return to basics, the film going for suspense and scares rather than outrageous OTT silliness.In some ways, this entry works as something of a reboot for the franchise, at least in terms of style. Not only is this one far more sober in tone than the last couple of movies, but it is also much nastier in terms of realistic violence, with some truly gut-churning scenes of gore. While I still would have loved to have seen another seriously nutso Chucky movie, as a gorehound, I couldn't help but appreciate this film's vicious streak. A juicy severed head gag, a barf-worthy knife-in-the-eye, and a really nauseating axe blow to the jaw are the film's sickening highlights.Curse of Chucky also benefits from a neat unexpected twist involving an adulterous affair, a convincing performance from first-time child actress Summer H. Howell, a memorable turn from grown-up actress Maitland McConnell (hubba, hubba!), and the welcome return of a familiar face in the film's closing moments.7.5 out of 10, rounded up to 8 for the excellent splatter.",Curse of Chucky
8,paul_haakonsen,"Entertaining, but nothing jaw-dropping or mind-blowing to be had here...",5,8 October 2013,"Honestly, then I had no clue that they made another Chucky movie, and it wasn't really something that particularly spawned any sense of excitement in me when I stumbled upon the movie by sheer luck.""Curse of Chucky"" is a good enough movie in itself, however, it isn't a movie that will revolutionize the Chucky franchise, and at the same time it is not a movie that really left a lasting mark. Is it a movie that the franchise would have been any less interesting if they hadn't made this? No.The story is about a family receiving a Good Guy doll in the mail, from an unlisted sender. People start to die and blood runs red in the old house as the doll comes to life and starts slashing left and right.This movie didn't really bring all that much to the franchise. However, and this was actually the best part of the movie; you are introduced to the story of Charles Ray prior to what happened in the first movie.The deaths in the movie were something that you would expect from the previous movies, and they just didn't stand out or impress in any way. The effects were alright, but the death scenes were, well in lack of better words, mundane.The acting in the movie was quite alright, as it was with the prior movies as well. Nothing extraordinary, but people did good enough jobs with their given roles and characters. Brad Dourif does a great job with his voice acting, and his iconic voice is the true voice of Chucky.One of the better parts of the movie was towards the ending, because there is a nice cameo appearance here.",Curse of Chucky
9,Coventry,No more Mr. Slapstick Doll,6,29 October 2013,"Depending how you liked the previous installments in the ""Child's Play"" (Chucky) franchise, you will either consider it one of the best  or one of the worst of the series. Personally, I found ""Curse of Chucky"" the second best out of six movies. That still doesn't mean it's a great horror movie, but most definitely a step up the ladder for Don Mancini & Company and an enjoyable flick. Back in 1988, the original ""Child's Play"" was a reasonably creepy flick and it deservedly gained a modest classic status. Parts two and three were prototypic sequels, meaning more of the same in order generate quick cash. Ten years after the original, some enlightened spirits decided it would be a great idea to turn the franchise into slapstick with ""Bride of Chucky"". It was a Hollywood choice, you either love or hate hit. The series hit absolute rock-bottom in 2004 with ""Seed of Chucky"", a completely unendurable stinker with a lousy film-within-film structure and tasteless humor. Strangely enough, it was Don Mancini himself who ridiculed his own creation, but now – and again nearly a decade later – he corrects his mistake with the more traditional and old-fashioned ""Curse of Chucky"".For nearly the entire movie, the script pretends that the previous two movies never existed. Serial killer Charles Lee Ray's persona is trapped in the ginger Good Guys doll named Chucky and he arrives, in a parcel, at the doorstep of the wheelchair-bound Nica and her mother. The next morning, Nica finds her mother dead in a pool of blood and Chucky inexplicably pops up at various places around the house. While Nica's family gathers together, and her young niece Alice falls in love with the Chucky doll, we slowly discover Charles Lee Ray's connection to these people and his diabolical plan to return in human shape. ""Curse of Chucky"" is never really innovative or even surprising, but that doesn't matter because it's efficient. In spite of being a straight-to-video production, it's much more suspenseful and atmospheric than any of its predecessors. Chucky spits out a lot less comical monologues (but more often reverts to this classic Good Guys quotes like ""I like to be hugged"" and ""I'll be your friend till the end"") and the murders are more brutal and horrific than before. The script is quite incoherent near the end, but it was definitely courageous and satisfying (for the fans of the very first film) to clear up a few enigmas around Charles Lee Ray's persona. And plus, it was the ideal occasion to bring Brad Dourif back on the screen entirely rather than just his voice. Moreover, the film also stars his talented and ravishing daughter Fiona in one of her first lead roles. Chucky is a horror symbol again, so even if imperfect, I recommend this flick!",Curse of Chucky
10,michaelRokeefe,The revival of Chucky,7,27 December 2020,"It is the return of the pint-sized red headed menace, Chucky. Possessed by the devilish spirit of serial killer, the notorious doll is back to cause dread and havoc. Nica (Fiona Dourif), following the death of her mother, has become very suspicious of the doll her visiting niece is playing with. New life to the franchise that began in 1988.The cast also features: Chantal Quesnelle, Danielle Biscutti, Maitland McConnell, Jennifer Tilly and Brad Douriff as the voice of Chucky.",Curse of Chucky
11,Hey_Sweden,Works somewhat better than expected.,6,13 October 2014,"""Child's Play"" series creator Don Mancini and his longtime producer David Kirschner take the series back to its serious roots with this watchable movie. While not exactly inspired, it does put one fresh spin on the formula. Chucky, voiced once again by the reliable Brad Dourif, is still the profane, sadistic little force of nature that he's always been. Mancini does go out of his way to tie events in this story to events in previous sequels, which may please some fans. (It *is* cool to see how Charles Lee Ray ended up being pursued by the police in the opening to the 1988 movie.) Characters and the script are sometimes silly, but Mancini largely forgoes lots of intentional comedy.His heroine this time already has one strike against her: Nica, played by Dourifs' sexy daughter Fiona, is a paraplegic. She receives the mystery gift of the Chucky doll at her door. Her niece Alice (Summer Howell) takes to the doll, naturally, while all around Alice there's drama going on between Nica, her sister Barb (Danielle Bisutti), Barbs' husband Ian (Brennan Elliott), and Jill the nanny (Maitland McConnell).Things start to fall apart towards the end as Mancini goes overboard in tying his movies together. The cameo appearance by a certain character is fun, but doesn't do much to alleviate matters. There's sufficient atmosphere as the murders start taking place over the course of one stormy night. Mancini quotes past movies in visual ways, such as Chucky quickly darting by in the background, and puts off showing the doll talking and moving as long as he can. In the uncut version, there is some very enjoyable splatter, especially a gag involving a severed head. Other than Fiona D., acting is adequate at best, although it's nice to see another veteran, A. Martinez, in the role of Father Frank. Brad D. is once again a hoot as the savage little psychopath, also getting to play the pre-Good Guy Charles Lee Ray in extended flashback footage. The special effects are on a par with the prior work in the franchise.Helping to end the movie on a satisfying note is the hilarious post-end credits sequence featuring another beloved veteran of these movies.Six out of 10.",Curse of Chucky
12,kannibalcorpsegrinder,Incredible addition to the series,9,24 February 2014,"Gathered together at her house, a paralyzed woman and her family attending a memorial service find themselves slowly killed off one-by-one by a strange killer, not realizing the killer's true identity or connection to the family.This here turned out to be quite an enjoyable and exciting entry. One of the biggest issues for that is the rather gloomy atmosphere present here, as the house here is kept dark, moody and bathed in sporadic light from the continuous thunderstorm outside which results in a pronounced Gothic flavor that is quite adept in building a fantastic atmosphere throughout. This in turn manages to keep the tension up throughout as well, aided along by some wonderfully creepy suspense-filled stalking scenes and the decision to keep Chucky's life hidden from the almost everyone until their moment of death are great calls to make the creepy air to this one quite overwhelming. These then make the action-packed scenes in the later half all the more impressive as the build-up has given them a rather strong platform and greater impact when they do occur, as the final half is practically one long series of chases throughout the house, where the bedroom encounter, the garage trap and the final brawl in the living room are able to make the most of themselves. There's a few problems areas here, mainly the constant series of false endings that keep going long past their usefulness and drag out the film needlessly when one of the earlier endings worked well enough. As well, too many of the kills are done off-screen or in such darkness that it's really hard to get the full effect when there's such a low body-count that there's a missed opportunity to really make something worthwhile, but otherwise there's not a whole lot wrong with this one.Rated R: Graphic Violence, Graphic Language and children-in-jeopardy.",Curse of Chucky
13,FlashCallahan,I like to be hugged.....,7,12 October 2013,"Nica, a young woman forced to a wheelchair since birth, has to regroup her sister, Barb and her brother-in-law, Ian for a funeral after the death of her mother. While dealing with her family, along with their 5-year-old daughter, Alice, Nica receives an odd package - a creepy doll. After people start showing up dead, Nica soon suspects that the creepy doll is much more than just a doll, and sounds like her real life dad.....The thing is with Curse Of Chucky, is that for the first half of the film, it feels like a generic slasher movie, aided by the gravitas of having an iconic villain as the central character, but then Mancini throws a spanner in the works, and makes it the best movie since the first.It's because there has been some thought thrown into the mix, a bit of imagination, and a little bit of love for the franchise, and Chucky.We learn why this family has been chose, and how it connects it to the first movie, and as to why Lee Ray became what he did.The rest of the cast are good, not just nameless actors thrown in for filler, and Chucky is as good as he ever was.The makers forget the abomination that was Seed Of Chucky, and throws this somewhere between the third movie and Bride.Its a must for fans, and a really good movie for horror fans, but there are so many treats toward the end, and for once, its a horror movie that is a little intelligent, which elevates it all the more.And leave the movie on after the credits.Well worth watching.",Curse of Chucky
14,movieman_kev,Became my second fave of the series rather quickly.,7,10 October 2013,"After wheelchair-bound Nica's mother dies mysteriously after getting a certain red-headed doll in the mail, she must contend not only her money grubbing sister whom wants to sell the family house outright, but a pint-sized homicidal maniac as well.After the previous two films devolved into outright comedy, this return to form was quite welcome indeed. It's been quite some time since Chucky has been anything that could be even remotely considered frightening, the fact that this film pulls that off should be cause for kudos in and of itself. But it's also capably acted and has nice tension throughout. So don't let this being a direct to DVD sequel put you off, it's good. Really good.",Curse of Chucky
15,trashgang,a delight for the fans,7,3 December 2013,"Out of the blue this was suddenly available in our shops and I was a bit afraid to watch a straight to DVD flick because mostly they suck. But I must admit that this is a joy for newcomers but especially for fans of Chucky this will be a happy ride.Forget the last entries in the Chucky franchise, this one takes you back to Child's Play (1988). The origin of Chucky is explained ones more here so for those not common with the story it explains it all. But this Chucky takes us also back before his 'bride' period and leaves the comedy out of it and goes back to the horror of a puppet being cursed. It takes a while before it all starts but when it does it's a rather nasty flick. It do has a bit of gory moments here and there and I wouldn't watch it with children still attached to their favorite doll. Luckily Brad Dourif did the voice again of Chucky but not only that, his daughter Fiona Dourif is in it too. A great relieve to see Don Mancini back behind the director's table. He did the original one and it shows here. Be sure to keep watching until after the end credits because that's a boner for the lovers of the franchise, Andy's back played by the original Andy (Alex Vincent).Gore 1,5/5 Nudity 0/5 Effects 3/5 Story 3/5 Comedy 0/5",Curse of Chucky
16,StevePulaski,How to revitalize and breed life into a previously dormant franchise,8,10 June 2014,"After laying dormant for nine years, the Child's Play franchise finally gets a resurgence with Curse of Chucky, which now makes Child's Play one of the few horror franchises to span over four decades. Following the release and solid success of Seed of Chucky, a sixth installment was planned but quickly scrapped when writing and directing positions couldn't be secured. Following the scrapped sixth film was the extensive and exhaustive talk and news of a remake of the original Child's Play, which, at first, was going to exclude Brad Dourif as the voice of Chucky but then went on to say he was attached to the product in 2008. Despite a couple years of solid planning, in 2011, MGM denied the news that the remake was in production, and that while the idea could have some leverage later on, for now, no plans to remake the film were being executed at that time.Out of the blue, in summer of 2013, a trailer for Curse of Chucky premiered and the film was finally released in October of the same year, thankfully not being burdened by the same line of delays as the first sixth installment and the remake. This time, the story takes place a shocking twenty-five years from when young, impressionable Andy Barclay first had his encounter with the murderous, knee-high Good Guy Doll after his mother purchased it from a shady, back-alley bum. We focus on a paraplegic woman named Nica (Fiona Dourif, daughter of Brad Dourif, who voices Chucky), who lives with her mother in an old, but lavish mansion that is decorated in Gothic style. The film begins by showing Nica and her mom receiving a mysterious package in the mail; a Good Guy Doll who proclaims its name is ""Chucky."" The next morning, Nica finds her mother dead on the floor, with vicious stab wounds. The death is implied a suicide by the coroner, and to give Nica a sense of comfort, her sister Barb (Danielle Bisutti), her husband Ian (Brennan Elliot), their daughter Alice (Summer H. Howell), and their live-in nanny Jill (Maitland McConnell) pay Nica and her spacious home a visit. Little do they know that they are in the company of Chucky (voiced by Brad Dourif), the infamous doll who bears the soul of murder Charles Lee Ray inside his plastic interior, and is hellbent on finding a person to transport his soul into so he can finally take human form. Of course, the immediate target for this soul transportation is Alice, being she is young, innocent, and almost entirely oblivious to grave danger. Not to mention, when Chucky transports his soul into her, he can live throughout his entire life starting at the tender ages.For starters, the eerie element of the franchise is restored with this installment. There is no more of the horror/comedy hybrid we saw with the last three installments. Curse of Chucky takes on a Hammer Horror-style, meaning that Gothic scenery, ubiquitous decorations, slowburn pacing, and atmosphere triumph over jump scares and silliness. This is how I prefer the series; creepy, tonally dark, and without the comedy of the latter two films. While the latter two films proved amusing in some regards, the true creepy element of a child's doll coming to life in order to take his soul was shortchanged so one-liners and goofy, situational comedy could take prominence instead. The whole thing left a bitter taste in my mouth, even if the outcomes of some events were occasionally satisfying.What director Don Mancini (who also directed Seed of Chucky) has done is return to the franchise in a manner that pays careful attention to detail and revitalizes aspects so that a new direction can be taken. Mancini does to the series what should be done, after it remained idle for nearly a decade. Mancini throws new characters into the mix, expands on backstory, and provides us with alternative routes the series can go, rather than just the briefly-fulfilling elements of another sequel.Mancini's only issue is that, by the end of Curse of Chucky, he has fallen too deeply in love with the material. Mancini winds up attaching about four different endings to the film. Just when you feel the credits are about to roll, there is another scene that further obscures the ending and how the film was meant to be tied up. Mancini even goes as far as to include a post-credit scene that contradicts the pre-credit scene that precedes it by just about four minutes, as novel as the post-credit scene is. Other than an attempt to name-drop and provide long-devoted fans with cameos of some of their favorite characters of the franchise, it's difficult to see Curse of Chucky's ending (or endings) as one to try and coherently conclude an otherwise solid picture.Having said that, there's still much more to see in this film than one could've initially thought. Being so devoted to the franchise as a young child, I am kind of ashamed it took me nearly a year to finally sit down and see the latest installment. With a sequel already in the works and Mancini still invested, there's hope in a seventh and maybe eighth installment to the franchise I'm sure many of us couldn't have foreseen getting a trilogy. With the abundance of Cabin Fever, Joy Ride, and Wrong Turn sequels and talks to expand the franchise of Jeepers Creepers, let it be known that when revitalizing a series - especially in the often frowned-upon and underestimated format of direct-to-DVD, that it comes down to how much you want to expand on the mythology and the storyline rather than providing viewers with a rather unsubstantial and forgettable experience.Starring: Fiona Dourif, Danielle Bisutti, Brennan Elliott, Maitland McConnell, Chantal Quesnel, Summer H. Howell, A Martinez, and voiced by Brad Dourif. Directed by: Don Mancini.",Curse of Chucky
17,KineticSeoul,The classic style Chucky movie is back,7,8 June 2014,"It's actually nice to see Chucky back to what he is notorious for while leaning more towards the horror suspense direction. This movie corrects most of the complaints people had about ""Seed of Chucky"" which was a travesty. Although the direction is focused on the playing doll, stealth and killing direction which Chucky is known for doing. They actually did a pretty decent job of incorporating a plot that connects with the previous ""Child's Play"" and ""Chucky"" movies. Without ruining the mythology or going in a super lame direction with it while showing more of the origin story of Charles Lee Ray aka Chucky. If you are a audience member that wants to see classic Chucky at his work than this movie won't disappoint for the most part. The development is actually kinda slow, but it isn't really boring and does hold some entertainment value. This is the first Chucky movie where most of the setting and scenery takes place within a house. However that doesn't detract from the movie, but adds to the classic slasher horror elements. Also wait after the end credits, it really is a great bonus. Which actually made look forward to the next sequel, hopefully it doesn't end up like another ""Seed of Chucky"". There is certain mysteries and unanswered questions in this installment where the last one left off, but that will probably answered in the next installment.

18,Hellmant,A return to form for fans of the original!,8,11 October 2013,"'CURSE OF CHUCKY': Four Stars (Out of Five)The sixth film in the popular 'CHILD'S PLAY' slasher movie franchise. It was written and directed by Don Mancini and once again (like all the other installments in the series) stars Brad Dourif as the voice of the infamous killer doll known as Chucky (one of my favorite movie villains). Brad's daughter Fiona Dourif also stars in the film as the movie's central heroine. Mancini wrote the original movie and all of it's sequels. He also directed the last installment, 'SEED OF CHUCKY', in 2004. This film takes place four years after the end of the previous movie and picks up with Chucky being mailed to a young woman, confined to a wheelchair, and her mother. He of course terrorizes them as we learn more history about Chucky than ever before. While it was released directly to VOD (and video shortly later), rather than theaters, it's still one of the best films in the franchise and a return to form for fans of the original!The film begins with Nica (Fiona Dourif) receiving a package in the mail. She lives with her mother, Sarah (Chantal Quesnelle), and is a paraplegic in her thirties. They open the box to find a mysterious doll inside, Chucky (voiced by Brad Dourif once again), who Sarah later throws away. After that Nica finds her mother dead, apparently from self-inflicted knife wounds. Her domineering sister Barb (Danielle Bisutti) shows up, at the house, to console Nica. She brings her husband Ian (Brennan Elliott), their young daughter Alice (Summer H. Howell) and Alice's live-in nanny Jill (Maitland McConnell). She also brings a priest from her church, Father Frank (A Martinez), to help with the family's grieving. Chucky of course begins killing them off one by one after first friending Alice, who he immediately exposes his true identity to. We later learn things about Chucky's past (and Charles Lee Ray, the killer trapped inside the doll) and why he chose to stalk this family.Mancini originally envisioned the film as a reboot (or remake) due to the demand of fans (of the series) wanting to see it return to it's more serious horror roots (instead of the over-the-top comedic approach the franchise transitioned into, with the last two films). Apparently he realized he could do this with a sequel instead (and it works). The movie is scary and it's packed with cleverly crafted suspense driven scenes; some are gimicky but they're extremely well done. I'm a big fan of the Chucky character and all of the movies, including the last two (which I thought were good but not as effective as the original and it's first sequel, the third film is probably my least favorite). Dourif is classic as always as Chucky, his daughter makes a good strong but vulnerable heroine and the rest of the cast is adequate enough as well (Bisutti is great as the bitchy sister). It's not nearly as classic as the original or as good as it's first sequel but it is nice to see it return to the elements of what made the series so good to begin with and it does a good job of tying all the films together in the end (including a post-credits scene, that you won't want to miss). Mancini is a good horror film director and a great writer and Chucky is a slasher movie monster icon! I can't wait to see even more sequels from Mancini.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llO-AVcYkfI",Curse of Chucky
19,thesar-2,Curses! I Thought Chucky Forgot Horror,5,10 October 2013,"Admittedly, I had to literally watch this movie two times in a relatively short time frame to ""get it.""While, there's not much to ""get"" in (Child's Play VI:) Curse of Chucky, I actually hated it the first time. I had to learn tonot watch a movie in a bad or distracted mood. Yeah, that first viewing wasn't a good one and not the movie's fault.With the second viewing, I learned to appreciate the movie more, and happy that Chucky finally found his way back to the only second installment that could be considered ""scary,"" with the original 1988 film the only other one. Now, it's still not perfect – there are dozens of flaws, inconsistencies and annoyances, but definitely effective overall.And speaking of those ""dozens of"" problems, perhaps that was their game plan. After all, this is a total throwback to the 1980s slasher movies that I love and appreciate it. It's a 100% homage to not just 1980s horror, but of the original Child's Play. All of those 1980s horror movies had its share of ""flaws, inconsistencies and annoyances."" Fans, like myself, of those 1980s slasher films, know that's just what we got back then, since they produced them practically every quarter of the year. But, today? Eh, I get the homage, but there's no need to do it, if on purpose, in this day and age.The basic, but again nod to the 1980s, story: after a mysterious package containing a doll arrives at an old and scary house, the residing mother is murdered, and even though her murder is not investigated (??), the surviving, wheelchair-bound daughter has her family and priest visit for the night before the funeral. Subplots galore, some shocking – I did NOT see that affair coming, some blah, Chucky, that doll, apparently is alive and has the need for murder.The movie is a-b-c in the suspense and realization mode of the kills and sadly, Chucky, who's shed his previous two movie-entries ""fun, funny and pun-loaded"" side, had very little original or hilarious things to say this time. Also, some of the scenes went on way too long. The group is served just plain chili with no sides, or other courses, and while it's tense and there's something bad in one of the dishes, the boring dinner seems to take up a big chunk of the screen time. Further, there's literally five endings to this (only 97-minutes) movie, the last of which (you have to watch at the tail end of the credits for this one) completely contradicts ending #4/5.That said, about the endings, some of them I did NOT see coming, and thoroughly enjoyed the cameos, both of them. Namely the last one, but the first one was also welcomed.There's nothing groundbreaking here, and yet, it should be noted that it is the first Chucky movie that at least attempted – successfully, that is, to be scary. Recommended for die-hard Chucky fans.* * *Final thoughts: Perhaps, there'll be more, but here's my ranking now that the series is (probably) complete:1. Bride of Chucky (4/5 Stars) 2. Child's Play (3½/5 Stars)3. Curse of Chucky (3/5 Stars)4. Child's Play 3 (2½/5 Stars) 5. Seed of Chucky (2½/5 Stars) 6. Child's Play 2 (2/5 Stars)",Curse of Chucky
20,Robert_duder,Welcome back old friend to the end!,8,5 October 2013,"The Child's Play series has always been near and dear to my heart as an 80's slasher fan. So my expectations for this were huge! However, I also knew that the odds of it being decent were pretty low. I mean its been nearly ten years since its predecessor and twenty five years since the original and this one was straight to video. However, they did a lot of things right to make sure this went okay. Ensuring they brought back Brad Dourif, connecting the film so intrinsically to the first Child's Play and letting the mastermind behind the entire Chucky franchise get back to the helm. These three things made sure it was not a disaster. It wasn't perfect, in fact I felt like the pacing was way off. The first hour of the film really drags itself out but they are telling a story and setting the stage so I can't fault them for that. The atmosphere is certainly more creep than gore and it is 45 minutes before we even hear Chucky's iconic voice (but its the perfect Chucky line!!) Finally things start to take off and we get treated to what any fan of Child's Play will remember as classic Chucky. I had heard that they were going to ignore Bride and Seed but that rumour was completely unfounded and one of the most brilliant aspects of this movie is how it ties everything together. I kept thinking that they had changed Chucky's look a little bit and I was disappointed at first and then much to my amazement there was a reason behind it all. Chucky's first official kill (the one we get to see) is freakin brilliant and finally brings back to fruition the classic 80's slashers that simply don't exist anymore.People always say about 80's slashers...no one could play --insert homicidal maniac's name here---better than whomever. So far they've replaced everyone from Freddy Kreuger to Pinhead and Brad Dourif has never been much more than the voice of Chucky and yet he has done it so brilliantly that I simply wouldn't accept anyone else behind the little murderous doll. His voice is brilliant for the role and hasn't wavered for a minute in 25 years. He is as strong as ever as Chucky and the only unfortunate part is that he doesn't have as many lines as he has had in previous films. Still Dourif is awesome as always. His real life daughter Fiona Dourif stars in the film as our ""scream queen"" Nica. I wasn't sure what to expect from her but she is actually excellent in her role. Its an interesting angle to have her in a wheelchair and it really made her character fascinating. Danielle Bisutti is appropriately awful as her sister Barb. She is unlikable and nasty and you wait in anticipation for Chucky to show her what's what...and he does...oh he does in one of the best Chucky scenes and lines in years. So Bisutti does a good job of making you not like her which is the entire point in many ways. Brennan Elliott is okay as Barb's husband Ian. He doesn't really have a lot of lines and very few effective scenes so he's just sort of there as fodder for Chucky. Maitland McConnell is decent as the nanny, Jill. You know for sure she is there for fodder and I would have thought the gratuitous nudity shot (although she had none besides a brief underwear scene.) She was good but not great and there strictly to support the story. Summer Howell was very good as the young Alice who befriends Chucky first. I think one of the things that made Child's Play so brilliant was the bizarre connection between the serial killer doll and the young Andy so having her in this brought back some of that awkward chemistry.Don Mancini is an 80's horror master and I am so glad he hasn't lost his style. In fact this is the first 80's slasher sequel that I felt like it kept much of its style and flavour from the original. There are a few subtle nods to the first film and the ending had been giggling in glee as a fan of the series. The ambiguous ending was perhaps slightly unnecessary but if they are honestly leading to another one...BRING IT ON!! Why this didn't go to theatres I will never understand because I would have paid twice to see this and loved every minute of it and I know Child's Play fans would agree. Mancini's style is absolutely noticeable with long shots and high ceiling shots that give you a terrifying real look at everything. The death count perhaps wasn't as high or quite as original as they used to be and the ending did feel a little rushed, and the first part of the film dragged a little but I wasn't disappointed with the whole picture. This was a ton of fun and I thought the old school slasher genre was dead and gone for me so welcome back Chucky and do yourself a favour and add this to your Child's Play collection because its a gory, thrilling treat. 8/10",Curse of Chucky
21,CuriosityKilledShawn,Good Luck Chuck,6,29 October 2013,"From the first couple of minutes it's easy to tell that Don Mancini is treating Curse more as a horror film than the previous couple of entries in the series. The movie is shot and edited to build suspense and is a world apart from the sitcom trappings of Seed.A girl in a wheelchair (Brad Dourif's hot daughter Fiona) living in a rural home with her troubled mother receives a mysterious package one afternoon. It's Chucky, and he's somehow managed to get himself in the mail again. He's arrived to settle a score, and soon enough he has brainwashed a child into keeping his secret and is sneaking about in the shadows offing unsuspecting victims.Many people are saying that this movie is a return to form, and that it retcons Bride and Seed out of existence. Er...no, the film very much DOES acknowledge the events of Bride and Seed. Even if you paid the bare minimum of attention it would be hard to not to realize this. But I guess that expecting the movie to go in a different direction only led to further surprises when it eventually did tie in to the previous movies as well as giving us more back-story to Charles Lee Ray.I was worried that Chucky would be all CGI as Kevin Yagher has not been involved with the series since Bride, and while there IS some CGI, he's anamatronic for the most part. Instead of hogging the camera though he keeps quiet watches the humans interact for about half the movie before unleashing toy terror. Horror composer Joseph LoDuca delivers a pastiche of the Renzetti, Revell, and Donaggio's efforts without giving Curse a signature sound of its own. Not really a complaint, but more of a missed chance.It's certainly a worthy sequel and a can be viewed as a genuine horror film without any of the guilty pleasure of Seed. Keep watching to the end of the credits for a further surprise that ties the series together even more (though it does contradict the closing scene before the credits actually roll).",Curse of Chucky
22,cosmo_tiger,The next 80's series to get a sequel. The next 80's series that is ruined by a sequel. Disappointing and slow. I say C+,5,27 September 2013,"""Hi, I'm Chucky wanna play?"" Nica (Dourif) is a young woman confined to a wheelchair and living with her mother. One day a package shows up and they are surprised to see a doll inside. After Nica's mother is found dead the rest of her family shows up and little by little others are found dead. Nica has her suspicions about the little doll but no one believes her. I have to admit that I do like the Child's Play series. The original is cheesy and fun to watch. Little by little they got more and more cheesy ultimately leading to Jennifer Tilly making fun of herself. What they did realize though is the cheesier they got the more humor they added in to make it more fun to watch. That said I was looking forward to seeing this one. Since it seems like all 80's movies are getting sequels this one was next on the list. Hopefully the fact that this is straight to video will convince them to stop. While this isn't terrible this installment is just very slow movie and boring. They went more serious with this one and I think that may have hurt the enjoyment of it. It could have been just my expectations of this but I found it really hard to get into. In order to get most of the little flashbacks and some plot points in this you do have to see all the others first. On the other hand re-watching all the others will show you just how bad this one is. Overall, disappointing, very disappointing. I give it a C+.",Curse of Chucky
23,nairtejas,The Amazing Comeback Of A Beloved Character. ♦ 80%,8,26 September 2013,"There's something adorable about the central character as after its last installment in 2004, it still continues to attract audience. Too bad it didn't see the light of theater this time. A possible sequel inkling at the end works as a great idea.The most appealing thing about this film is that it inter-links itself with the first film: how it all happened & what! Though it is spoken about at the end, the horror appeal it precedes is fantastic, with all gore & violence, pure Chucky style. Since the beginning, a series of suspense-driven plot engages us and when Chucky enters the screen, the experience doubles. It maybe slightly feeble, the story, the screenplay works for the movie. CGI & VFX aren't that though=upon, but they induce repugnance.Characters are fine, but they seem to escalate quickly. Told in about 100 minutes, the second half excels with all pride of the basic idea of how the doll starts avenging his dreadful fate. Marvelous dialogs & scene-jerks makes this a great comeback.BOTTOM LINE: Highly Recommended for the franchise-follower. Others may get surprised with the content & theme. An enjoyable horror flick! All this may seem exaggerated, but trust me, it is good stuff.Can be watched with a typical Indian family?

The events takes place 25 years aft the first film n thank God it doesn't have anything to do with the horrible Bride n Seed parts. We r supposed to ignore the events of part 4 n 5 but stick with the character of Tiffany.Once again (similar to part 3) Chucky is wrapped n couriered to a new destination, an isolated house of a paraplegic girl who lives with her mother.
But this time they showed how Chucky got in the box n got mailed.
The best thing is the brutal kills n the downright sinister n creepy Chucky.
The other good stuff is this time they explained how Chucky got into the parcel box n got itself couriered.
The unrated version is brutal n has some lovely slasher moments but it has some qs unresolved.
The fate of Alice specially aft the chant.
And how come Chucky is still in the doll form.
And why Chucky preferred a female child's body n not that of a male child.

Somehow it took them that long to work out that these movies weren't supposed to be light-hearted and comedic. 'Curse of Chucky' was such a welcome relief after all that time. 'Bride of Chucky' and 'Seed of Chucky' were such a waste of an amazing character. I mean you would never put Leatherface into a light-hearted comedy would you? So why did they do it with Chucky.The kills aren't as creative as in previous installments, but that is replaced by pure intensity from Chucky. It also includes some cleverly edited twists that pay homage to the original 'Child's Play' film. Unfortunately Jennifer Tilly wasn't able to stay away from things altogether, but her cameo is brief and only kills the mood for a few minutes (better than a whole damn movie).Possibly the best Chucky film since the original, I really enjoyed this one.

The box is addressed to the controlling mother, who dumps the doll in the trash. Later that night she's found dead.The next day, Nica's family arrives- her sister Barb and husband, their daughter, a nanny, and for some reason a priest, as Barb is religious. Barb wants to sell the house, but it's Nica's home so she refuses. Nica finds the doll in the trash and gives it as a gift to the girl. And once the girl goes everywhere with the doll, Chucky's mischief starts. He poisons the priest, electrocutes the nanny, and then goes after everyone else while the little girl has gone missing. All of this of course takes place at night during a storm and when the lights have gone out. We end up learning a lot about this family and their connection to Chucky and also a bit about the origins of Chucky.Curse of Chucky does have something of an 80s feel to it. Its direction is more relaxed and overall the movie is nothing like horror movies of recent years. There's no neurotic editing, comparatively little malevolence, no obnoxious loud noises. What you do get though is a well-thought out story and plenty of dialogue, even an interesting psychological explanation. Initially it seems that the dad is having an affair with the nanny as they constantly flirt with each other, but you'll be surprised to find out who actually the girl is involved with. Casting could be much better, none of the women here are particularly attractive.

More than anything, ""Curse of Chucky"" feels like a soft reboot; it has all of the elements of the original film and really returns to it's slasher roots, but it also incorporates scraps of the sequels. As a pseudo-fan of the series, I found that I really enjoyed this approach to Chucky. While many of the sequels thus far have focused more on the comedic aspect of Chucky's character, this film begs us to take Chucky seriously again, and it works pretty well.

39,Amari-Sali,"Setting aside the issues the film has with continuity, this direct to DVD sequel redeems the series after the horrible Seed of Chucky.",7,7 October 2013,"Over the last few years, we have seen quite a few remakes of classic Horror villains. We had Rob Zombie's Halloween in 2007, and the sequel in 2009; the 2009 Friday the 13th which I don't remember what so ever; The remake of Nightmare on Elm Street in 2010; and now Chucky's return in 2013 with Curse of Chucky. Now, I've seen all of Chucky's films, even the terrible Seed of Chucky, and while this film does have issues with skipping some details about Charles Lee Ray, it takes away a lot of the bad comedy of Seed of Chucky and looks to return to Chucky's roots.With every Child's Play movie, and the later films, Chucky always found a family to terrorize. Be it the Barclays, the Kincaid, or the Tillys, Chucky was always found by a loving family. For this round, we have a family which features Nica (played by Fiona Dourif - Brad Dourif's daughter) who is a paraplegic with a heart of gold, or so it seems; her older sister Barbara (played by Danielle Bisutti) who is snobbish, and in a unsatisfactory marriage, but loves the lord; and their mother Sara (played by Chantal Quesnelle) who is a woman who has gone nuts. Rounding off the main cast is, of course, Chucky/ Charles Lee Ray (played by Brad Dourif). This go around, Chucky isn't trying to be as comical as he was in Bride of Chucky or Seed of Chucky, he returns to a more sinister being who has a sick sense of humor. Charles Lee Ray on the other hand, well let's just say they sort of ruin the killer who came before the doll in this film.Story wise, Chucky gets delivered to the house of Sara and Nica by someone who we meet at the end of the film. That aside, Chucky as usual plays the doll role as long as he can before attacking but, after his first murder, he gets to meet Barbara and her family consisting of her husband Ian (played by Brennan Elliott), nanny Jill (played by Maitland McConnell) and daughter Alice (played by Summer Howell). Naturally, being a child's toy, he ends up spending a good portion of his time with Alice, who is less than 10, and preps her to play Chucky's favorite game ""Hide the Soul."" Of course though, Chucky can't keep himself from killing so one person dies after another and eventually all that is left is him and Alice. But, Chucky seemingly has forgotten many of the rules involved with transferring his soul so an old friend has to get involved in order for him to finally get out of that damn doll's body.Now, let me first say, once again, this movie is so much better than Seed of Chucky. They took away all the random pop culture references and brought back the creep factor of a living toy. This isn't to say though Chucky doesn't throw a joke or two in there, but they are more so the jokes he did during the Child's Play days, than the later ones. Also, I love the way the animatronics team handled Chucky's movements to make him doll like again. It aided in making him a scarier figure and reminded us why he used to be something which gave people nightmares. Lastly, I must say that this is probably, minus one or two things, the best written Chucky adventure. The dialog and story is written much better than what most horror films have to offer, and while it isn't award worthy, it definitely is good enough to make Curse of Chucky seem like it had more thought put into it than the other sequels/ remakes of horror films we've seen as of late.But, the film isn't without issues. The first issue you'll notice is that it selectively acknowledges past films in terms of what goes on with Chucky's body, and how to address the 5 films which come before the movie. In some ways it does this well by Chucky noting the families he has terrorized, but then you wonder why they rewrote what led Charles Lee Ray into possessing a Good Guy's doll. Also, the inclusion of Charles Lee Ray is central to the story, and I felt his inclusion ruined the man who became the puppet. Lastly, though I am not fond of Glen/Glenda, being that this is a sequel, you sort of wonder what happened to them?Overall: RentalIf you can set aside the issues of continuity, and Charles Lee Ray being diminished as a villain, this is such a good film that it could revive the franchise. Curse of Chucky reminds you, without being a remake, what made the doll one of the horror icons. He is something you wouldn't suspect, he makes the slightest move of a curtain or pitter patter on the floorboards seem all the more creepy, and to get people to believe you is hard because he is a doll. This is why I think the film is a rental. It may not be the most scariest of films out there, but with a few jump scares and the creepiness which was found in some of the original Child's Play movies, the makers of the film seem to recognize some of what worked in the past 5 films. Thus making a film which acknowledges the past killings and people in Chucky's career, while possibly leaving us with the potential for a future for the series. Even if it may be slim.",Curse of Chucky
40,a_chinn,Direct-to-video sixth Chucky film is surprisingly good and minus the comedy,7,5 February 2018,"The first Chucky film to be released direct-to-video is surprisingly good and also takes a surprising change of tone, abandoning the black comedy of the prior two films and going back to the straight horror of the first three films. Written and directed by Don Mancini, who's written every installment since the first film, brings style and suspense to this entry, and breaths renewed life into the franchise. But to recap, the first ""Chid's Play"" is straight horror and is a classic, but Child's Play 2 and 3 were straight horror films and pretty awful. Mancini reinvigorated the franchise with ""Bride of Chucky"" and ""Seed of Chucky"" by adding overt humor and heaps of over-the-top gore. It worked for me and brought me back to the franchise, but inappropriate puppet behavior only goes so far. In this sixth entry, a wheelchair bound Fiona Dourif (daughter of Brad Dourif, who plays Charles Lee Ray / Chucky) mysteriously receiving a Good Guy Doll in the mail and also visited by her unpleasant sister and her family, including her innocent young niece who is delighted by the red-headed doll. As with the first film, Chucky is primarily shown as an inanimate doll until the end of the film when he cuts loose and it's a doozey when he does. ""Curse of Chucky"" is a decidedly low budget film, taking place almost entirely in one location, but the special effects are equal any of the bigger budgeted prior films, which was the best place for this film to spend this film's limited budget. With music by Joseph LoDuca and with (SPOILER ALERT!) a fun cameo at the end by Tiffany (Jennifer Tilley) and an adult Andy Barclay (Chucky's child foe in the original film), this was a surprisingly strong sequel and well worth watching for fans of this franchise.",Curse of Chucky

42,Reviews_of_the_Dead,Better than Expected Installment into Series,7,16 July 2021,"This was a movie that I'll be honest; I didn't have high hopes for when I took it home as a pre-street from Family Video. I grew up mostly on the third movie in the series as it was always on the movie challenges. I also liked the second one quite a bit. Outside of that, Bride of Chucky was interesting in its way, but Seed I've seen once and didn't care for it. This one worked for me though after that first viewing. The synopsis here is after her mother's mysterious death, Nica (Fiona Dourif) begins to suspect that the talking, red-haired doll her visiting niece has been playing with may be the key to recent bloodshed and chaos.We start this movie off getting to meet Sarah (Chantel Quesnelle) who is the mother to Nica. Nica is wheelchair bound and it seems to be from birth. Nica was going to college but dropped out and her mother is protecting her. She isn't very nice about it though. A package is delivered and it is addressed to Sarah. She opens it to find a Good Guy doll. That night, a scream wakes up Nica and she goes to check to find her mother murdered.To help out with the funeral, Nica's sister shows up with her family. The sister is Barb (Danielle Bisutti). She is married to Ian (Brennan Elliott), who is struggling work wise currently. There is also their live-in nanny of Jill (Maitland McConnell). Ian can't seem to keep his eyes off her. There is also their daughter of Alice (Summer H. Howell). Joining them is Father Frank (A Martinez). We learn that Sarah and Nica left the church some time ago, but Frank is there if she needs him.It is around this time that Nica notices that the Good Guy doll is missing. Alice finds it and where she does is a cause of confusion for Nica. Alice learns his name is Chucky. We soon see that Chucky is alive. He poisons one of the bowls of chili for dinner and that is just the beginning of the mayhem.That is where I'm going to leave my recap for this movie and what I find enjoyable about this movie is that it is getting back to form of the Child's Play series. What is interesting is that this plays like a reboot for a good part of it. We know this is a sequel from research that Nica does that confirms events of the past happened. This movie plays with the idea that only Nica and Alice know the doll is alive. It takes the former a bit to realize it and Alice being a kid, no one will believe her. This is taking it back more to the slasher roots as well.Something I found interesting is how many of the characters are unlikeable. The movie also plays with troupes of this as well. Nica is handicapped but doesn't want to be treated that way. Barb is convinced that her sister cannot do anything to help herself and wants her to move into an assisted living facility. This is in part that her family is struggling monetarily so she wants to sell the house. She is mean to her husband, so it makes you think that he's interested in Jill. I'll say, this young woman is attractive. There was an interesting reveal there that makes a lot of sense as well.I want to shift the focus next to Chucky. Now the last two films we saw him, he has the stitched-up face. This movie here has a more traditional look, which made me think reboot. I did like a reveal later in this movie to in fact confirm, every movie leading up to this happened. There is a shift in Chucky as well that he might not necessarily being trying to get out of the body and embracing what being inside of the doll means. Having seen the next movie in line, I know something there that I won't spoil, but we get a bit of that here. Chucky is quite brutal with some things that happen in the unrated cut here.Since I've delved into the character, I'll go next to the acting. Brad Dourif is back as the voice of Chucky. He's a great actor in general and he owns this character for me. That isn't to say the remake isn't good, but it is hard to top an actor who has taken it on for as long as he has. I liked that his real-life daughter of Fiona taking on the role of Nica here. She does a good job and it is this movie that I find her the most attractive. Bisutti, Elliott and McConnell are all solid. They are flawed. Bisutti doesn't have any redeemable qualities, but the other two show a bit. McConnell is also quite attractive. I'd say the acting on the whole is solid.Then the last thing that I wanted to go into here would be the effects. It looks to be like they did as much with Chucky as they could practically. There are a few times where there is something off about the face and I'm assuming it was because they were going to have it move in a certain way. That took me out of the movie, I'll be honest. Aside from that, I think most of the kills look good. There is a bit of CGI that didn't hold up, but not as much as I thought. There is some solid cinematography here as well.So then in conclusion, this movie surprised me the first time I saw it and I think it is still solid. I like them going back more to their roots from where the series was going. The voice acting of Dourif as Chucky is on point. Fiona Dourif is solid as our lead and the rest of the cast is solid. I'm middle of the road when it comes to the effects while the soundtrack fit for what was needed. There are some decisions made in this movie that don't make sense. Some of it can be chalked up to a slasher movie, but I want a bit more from this series. For me, this is movie is over average, but just coming up short to go higher.My Rating: 6.5 out of 10.",Curse of Chucky
43,robertemerald,Surprisingly effective chiller,8,28 June 2020,"Curse of Chucky, as well as its sequel Cult of Chucky, make for a highly charged and entertaining horror double. I was worried that horror which relied on a doll would be a bit cliche and leaning toward cheap thrills. Not at all. If you look at the special features on the dvd disks you'll see how much effort went into making the doll come to life. It's all very creepy, and a tad diabolical.",Curse of Chucky
44,vengeance20,The Franchise has lost it's buzz!,6,24 July 2014,"When I heard about this getting made I was excited! After watching the previous films of course I was wondering what this one was going to be like. Though I didn't like Bride of Chuck which wasn't so good & especially Seed of Chucky, which sucked balls of the lowest order, I still wanted to see this one! No Comedy-Horror crap or anything arsing about! It was going to be a straight up Horror film! Nothing else!Unfortunately, the film was quite disappointing. I'm really struggling to grasp what it is I didn't like about the film, I just didn't feel the ""Child's Play"" vibe I guess. Even more so, it didn't ""feel"" like a late 80s early 90s kind of setting or film for that matter. Again, not sure what it was. There are a number of possibilities I could list.The kills were OK, not really creative or gory enough for my standards! And believe me, I have quite high standards when it comes to the level of gore in a Horror Film if the film leads on to be! Something along the lines of the Evil Dead remake, which was just epic in terms of gore! But the deaths in this film weren't really as good! I miss the good old Chuck Kills which were far more intense & creative!The story-line was OK. Not much to say really. Though it was quite flat & boring. Although I did like the whole flash backs at the end & how the story connected with the rest of the series, showing us stock footage from the previous films! Liked that, that was good. But I was kind of hoping they would involve Andy Barclay or any other characters from the previous installment. (This was meant to be a direct continuation of Child's Play 3) I don't mind spin-off's too much, but I really would've liked it better if they had had Andy Barclay & some of the others in the film too! Shame.I overall think that this film could've been a whole lot better! I'm still stuck to think what! It's just difficult to say! Though I liked the effects, I still can't think what it was! I just didn't feel it to be honest! The kills the story! I don't know! I'm just going to say, that the Child's Play Franchise is just better suited to the era it was created in. (Late 80s, Early 90s)3/10",Curse of Chucky
45,vengeance20,"Better than Bride & Seed, but doesn't quite cut it...!",6,4 August 2018,"After nearly a decade, we get Curse of Chucky! But the director & creator looking at the 2 pathetic sequels after Child's Play 3, acknowledged the critics & fans plea for a serious Child's Play film & so he gets on top of it & does it! This film was in talks of making after I watched all 5 back in 2012 so to hear that another was being made was epic & excited me to say the least when they mentioned that it was going back to the way things were before Bride of Chucky!But I beg to differ that after watching, the 6th installment, Curse of Chucky, didn't really deliver in the way that Id' hoped! I mean the sequel was far better than the last 2, but lacked the late 80's early 90's horror feel the first 3 films had!Long story short, I wanted to like this film, but couldn't due to the fact that it lacked what I mentioned above! But hey compared to Bride & Seed, this film craps all over those films. But compared to the first 3 films including Child's Play 3, nope, this film sadly falls flat.The story-line wasn't bad & the kills were alright. But in terms of creativity, the filmed lacked badly. It could've been better. but I did like the prequel story-line to the film, but that in itself felt forced & put on. Overall not amazing, but hey, better than Bride & Seed, though doesn't come close to Child's Play 1 2 & (especially) 3! 6/10",Curse of Chucky
46,TedStixonAKAMaximumMadness,"A nostalgic trip down memory lane, ""Curse of Chucky"" at times seems more a loving tribute to the franchise than a proper sequel. Longtime fans should be pleased.",8,14 September 2016,"Ah, nostalgia. Those warm, fuzzy feelings when you think of years that are long since gone. That yearning for a taste of your childhood. The ooey-gooey oozing of love for the past.Nostalgia is something common to everyone. And it's also become something of a business in itself in recent years. Entire industries, media personalities and business ventures are established constantly, all revolving around that magical and vitally important term ""nostalgia."" You see it everywhere... from web personalities reviewing old movies to old-fashioned media given deluxe re-releases to retro-styled chotskies you can pick up in most modern shops. Nostalgia is everywhere these days.And why shouldn't it be? With the world in increasing measures of uncertainty and chaos, nostalgia is a healthy, accessible and uplifting escape for many.Why do I bring this up here? Because that wonderful word ""nostalgia"" seems to be at the forefront of the most recent entry in the ""Child's Play"" franchise, ""Curse of Chucky."" While technically the sixth film in the series, this one is quite old- fashioned, and seems to aim at tugging on the nostalgia of audiences who have grown up with the series. At times, it almost feels more like a loving tribute to the series than it does a full-on ""sequel""... with numerous references and call-backs to tie it all together, on top of the obvious attempts at replicating the darker tone of the original.Following the death of her mother, the family of paraplegic Nica Pierce (Fiona Dourif) begins to gather to help grieve and give their support. But not all is well with the Pierce household. Her sister Barb (Danielle Bisutti) is having relationship troubles with her husband (Brennan Elliott), which is also causing some rifts with their daughter Alice (Summer H. Howell). Barb is also pushing to have Nica sent to an assisted living home against Nica's wishes. And to top it all off, a mysterious package arrived the night before Nica's mother's death... a package with a mysterious doll named ""Chucky"", who may or may not be responsible... (Hint: He is. Obviously.)I really adored the cast. Fiona Dourif (funnily enough the daughter of Chucky's voice actor Brad Dourif) is a ton of fun and is just really, really good. Not only is she lovable, but she gives the character a great, subtle sense of strength, pathos, self-doubt and hope. She gives Nica a great deal of dimension, and emerges as one of the most likable slasher-film protagonists in quite some time. Wonderful. Danielle Bisutti is devilishly delightful as Barb- a character who enjoys being in control a little too much. Brennan Elliott brings a nice sense of balance as husband Ian. And supporting roles by the likes of A Martinez, Maitland McConnell and Summer H. Howell are all very solid.And of course Brad Dourif excels in his voice-over role as Chucky the killer doll, aka Charles Lee Ray. By this time, he's been been playing the role for well over two decades, and it's a role he can probably play while sleeping. But he still gives Chucky a good sense of diabolical personality, and relishes in the fun he has doing what he does best. Without spoiling any of the specifics, it was also nice to see Dourif in-person in a few new short flashback sequences that take place before the original.Writing and directing duties are once again taken by series creator Don Mancini. In addition to writing all six films, he also helmed the divisive fifth entry, ""Seed of Chucky."" Here, he seems keen on redeeming the series after that film, which the majority of fans seem to view as the weakest in the series. And so, he goes about crafting a darker, smaller-scoped and more claustrophobic tale with this sixth entry, attempting to re-capture the sense of dread and wonder that the original film largely succeeded at.For the most part, I'll say Mancini is successful. He's learned better use of composition and camera flow since his last outing, and also really learned how to ratchet up the thrills. It's by far one of the most stylish entries in the series. His writing also takes a big step up. Especially in giving all the major characters a clearly defined personality and arc, and grounding them more in reality than the ""cartoon characters"" in the broadly-humorous last two films were.The film also benefits from playing off on its nostalgic routes as I mentioned above. It makes sure to address aspects from virtually every single previous entry in the series, with many nice winks and nods to prior characters and story lines. There's also a lot of pondering on the past done here, with some clever use of retroactive continuity that I refuse to spoil outside of saying it sort-of ties the entire franchise together with a nice, big bow. And there's also just fan-service aplenty. It's what makes this movie feel so much more like a tribute than just another entry. It's a huge aspect of the story, and I think a lot of longtime series fans will get a kick out of it so long as they don't overthink it. (Because trust me... Chucky fans often do overthink things and seem to care more about things like continuity and consistency than even the series creator.)If there's anything negative to be said about the film, it's that it does become a tad disjointed in its final act. Especially if you are watching the unrated cut, which features a bonus scene I will not spoil. It's also a bit too meandering up-front and there's one or two minor characters who seem superfluous in the grand scheme of things. (A police officer character for example, who is carefully established but then never does anything... seems pointless.)Still, for what it is, ""Curse of Chucky"" is slasher-flick Nirvana! It's a strong 8 out of 10 for me as a Chucky fan!",Curse of Chucky
47,udar55,A surprising (and welcome) return to scary Chucky territory,7,22 November 2013,"Nearly a decade after SEED OF CHUCKY (2004) comes this new sequel that went direct-to-video. Paraplegic Nica (Fiona Dourif, daughter of Brad) and her mother Sarah (Chantal Quesnel) receive a mysterious package in the mail containing a Good Guy doll. That night, Sarah is found dead from a supposed suicide. Nica's sister Barb (Danielle Bisutti) and her family arrive for the funeral, but Barb also has ulterior motives as she wants to sell the house and put Nica in an assisted living home. Of course, pint sized doll Chucky aka Charles Lee Ray (as always, voiced by Brad Dourif) has his own plan. You have to give Universal some credit for not going a remake and you might actually be surprised at how well done this 6th entry in the franchise is. Director Don Mancini - who has scripted the series since part 1 and directed the overly comical SEED - returns to the serious tone of the original. This starts as just another ""family terrorized by Chucky"" entry but, believe it or not, Mancini finds a way to tie the characters from this one with the original film. Fans of the other films will definitely be pleased (make sure to stick around for an extra scene past the credits). The FX are pretty good and they manage to seamlessly blend the animatronic and practical work. The unrated cut is also surprisingly gory.",Curse of Chucky
48,Pumpkin_Man,A Fairly Decent Comeback for Chucky!!!,10,24 September 2013,"Ever since I was six years old, I've loved the Chucky series. I had high expectations for Chucky's 6th film, but I was pretty letdown. The first half of the movie is so slow and bland that it doesn't even feel like a Chucky movie. It felt like a spooky soap opera and Chucky was just sitting in the background, letting you remember that it's supposed to be his movie. It definitely goes back to the darker tone of the Child's Play series, but it just doesn't have the same spirit. Heck, even Seed of Chucky was more entertaining. The last half is where this movie actually starts to pick up and become interesting. There is a great flashback scene that gave me chills that explains why Chucky is attacking this family and how it leads to the opening of the original film, which I thought was EPIC! The after-credits scene was just as awesome as it finally gives us the return of Andy Barclay! When her mother supposedly kills herself, paraplegic Nica deals with her loss and the rest of her dysfunctional family. A Good-Guy doll by the name of Chucky shows up and befriends Barbara's daughter, Alice. Soon, grisly murders begin to happen and Nica links the doll to all the past murders and must fight Chucky before he gets his long-awaited revenge.

First of all, the house is so creep and beautiful with the attic and the elevator. Secondly, the characters are really intriguing: Nica is the final girl whose father didn't actually drown before she was born but he was killed by Charles Lee Ray because he wanted to be in his place. But it was actually a sequel to the first film right before Charles Lee Ray got caught dead in the toy store, he had abducted Nica's mother. Then there's Nica's horrible sister and the nanny who's her lover, the husband who's trying to prove her disloyalty with a camera on Chucky and the little girl Alice. Finally Nice found guilty of the murders and locked up in a facility for the criminally insane. And the biggest surprise is Tiffany at the very end who again took him out of the evidence bag and killed an officer and mailed him to the grandmother of Alice the little girl. They must have plans for Nica. Besides, I like how Nica explained the reason why Chucky didn't kill Andy because of his completion anxiety which is very common among men she said. And she's paraplegic because Charles Lee Ray stabbed her mother when she abducted her.The kill count and gore are satisfying and the acting is quite good. I definitely love this franchise but this film is really good even if you're not that in love.",Curse of Chucky
50,IonicBreezeMachine,Chucky returns to his horror roots in this solid DTV effort that's probably the most legitimately scary entry since the first one.,6,22 October 2021,"Nica Pierce (Fiona Dourif) is a young paraplegic woman who having dropped out of college and suffering from a heart defect lives with her mentally ill mother in a large cavernous rundown house. The two are sent a Good Guy doll through the mail for no real reason and both write off its arrival as a joke. When Nica's mother dies, this prompts the arrival of Nica's estranged sister Barb (Danielle Bisutti), Barb's husband Ian (Brennan Elliott), their daughter Alice (Summer H. Howell), and their live in nanny Jill (Maitland McConnell). Nica gives Alice the Good Guy doll as a gift. The family is rife with unspoken resentment, barely concealed secrets, and duplicitous intentions, but eventually one by one something in the house starts taken them out and Nica discovers it might be connected to the doll.Following the critical and box office disappointment of Seed of Chucky, series writer/creator Don Mancini and producer David Kirschner discussed the possibility of rebooting the franchise in accordance with the will of the fans who wanted Chucky to be ""scary"" again. Eventually the film found traction with Universals home media productions unit, Universal 1440 Entertainment, specializing in mining Universal lesser used franchise assets like Scorpion King and Beethoven. The sixth entry in the long running franchise doesn't reinvent the wheel, but is an effective back to basics take on the familiar killer doll that despite its low budget brings with it a level of style and intensity that does make the film and unsettling sit even if it does diverge into the goofier parts of the franchise.Brad Dourif's daughter, Fiona Dourif, plays the lead role of Nica and does a good job of playing this broken character who's been isolated from the world for such a long time and makes a likable sympathetic lead for whom we can root for. Don Mancini returns to the director's chair and has honed his craft since he stumbled with Seed of Chucky playing up the film's gothic almost haunted house like atmosphere with the house lovingly staged as a foreboding cavernous presence that makes for an entertaining setting. The rest of the cast are quite good all playing duplicitous rather conniving characters (save for Alice) and there's almost a locked room mystery type atmosphere especially in the earlier scenes where the Doll isn't shown that much and Brad Dourif's voice is absent. Scenes such as a dinner scene where one of the plates has been mixed with rat poison is really well done with the dinner continuing onward and no clear indication of who ate the poisoned meal until it was too late. Of course once the pretense is dropped we get the familiar Chucky antics of over the top kills and twisted jokes/one liners, but they fall more in line with the style of the first three Child's Play movies than with Bride or Seed of Chucky.Speaking of which, despite pulling a complete 180 from the self-parody the series had been known for since the mid-90s, Mancini keeps EVERYTHING in continuity. This is certainly admirable as we've seen franchises like Halloween, Friday the 13th, and Texas Chainsaw Massacre retcon, reboot, and remake themselves into continuity nightmares, so the fact Mancini has kept the plot thread going through not only 6 movies but massive tonal shifts is really impressive. Some of the additional backstory to Charles Lee Ray involving the night he was killed in Child's Play seems a little clunky, but the effort they put in to make it work for the most part was nicely done and with some real stylish touches. I also liked seeing Brad Dourif go back to being a genuinely sinister presence with a sick sense of humor as opposed to the more comedically skewed interpretation.Curse of Chucky revives the franchise with some good scares and enjoyable silliness. While the movie may have a lower budget than its theatrical counterparts, it uses its relative lack of resources to up the atmosphere and suspense and revisit the elements of the series that won the fanbase in the first place. It doesn't reach the level of Child's Play, but I'd say it more than exceeds the level of Child's Play 2-3, Bride, and definitely Seed. If you're a Chucky fan, you'll get your money's worth.",Curse of Chucky

52,ASouthernHorrorFan,"My Review Of ""Curse Of Chucky""",9,2 October 2013,"""Curse Of Chucky"" is the latest sequel in the iconic horror franchise. The film is directed by Don Mancini and stars Danielle Bisutti, Brad Dourif, Fiona Dourif, A Martinez, Maitland McConnell, Brennan Elliott, Chantal Quesnelle, Jennifer Tilly and Summer H. Howell. ""Curse Of Chucky"" offers a full circle tribute to the franchise while maintaining an original and fresh concept. This film also offers a more serious and darker story reminiscent of ""Child's Play"" 1 & 2. A story that was more chillingly horror driven than tongue-in-cheek shtick that the franchise later became known for. A mysterious package arrives with the infamous doll, with the soul of a serial killer, to a home of Sarah and Nica. Sarah is a struggling mother on meds and daughter Nica is in a wheelchair. Of course this being a return to the horror, mommy dies expectantly. After that the rest of the family gather at the house to break bread and bury the mother. Yeah that hardly gets off the ground thanks to the great little re-gift from the beginning of the film. Chucky proves still full of murderous rage and evil intent. ""Curse Of Chucky"" takes on a darker story and classic haunting atmospheric personality right from the beginning. It is a clean, strong and well thought out story to say the least. It is obvious that this sequel was not made just for the sake of twisted quick-wit banter and almost comical kill scenes from a Good Guy doll. Personally I feel satisfied in knowing that I can squeeze this sequel right into the series just after 1 & 2 and be happy or even as numero 6 considering the cool, slightly cheeky ending. The special effects, and cinematography was classic horror atmospheric thrills. Camera tricks that accent the shadows, moments of sudden shock for real reason, and creepy sound effects played well against a truly freaky setting. Location is everything in a horror film and "" Curse Of Chucky"" brings the spooky old house back to the foreground of horror. The characters are well written and offer just enough personality to connect with without becoming annoying or pretentious. Chucky himself was on screen and evil enough to be convincing and entertaining without looking completely childish or lame. That is a big part that makes the 3-5 sequels more stoned amusement than actual tales of terror. His presence is very strong and chilling on screen much like in the original and the second film which puts ""Curse Of Chucky"" as a great horror film and killer sequel. Blood and gore is limited to the absolute moments of necessity with the kill scenes sharing in the overall film rather than trying to become some overloaded spectacle. ""Curse Of Chucky"" is a awesome horror movie and one that any horror fan, especially of the ""Child's Play"" franchise will definitely enjoy.",Curse of Chucky

I easily hate this film, it has not happy ending it has so many awful crap in here.I am not giving this movie a pass just because it try's to be scary, it is not a good movie and to me it is way to over long.I will never understand any praise that this film got. It is the Curse Of F****. Because it f****** sucks. It's boring, it's cheap, and it has the worst kills of the entire franchise. And Chucky looks like he had some bad plastic surgery and he looks like a Barbie doll in this movie.This movie try's to be a prequel and the same time try's to be a sequel to Child's Play and it failed. This movie is a failure to me I can't believe people like this movie I don't and I never will!!!!! So now I just hear another sequel comes of Chucky this November Cult of Chucky (2017) Mancini I am tiered of these sequels. Stop making sequel after sequel after sequel you asshole! I am tired of this movies.I tried to root for Fiona Dourif daughter of Brad but it just didn't work out. This movie was so boring and horrible that I can't even say with words. The acting was wooden from everybody, the script and the direction was a failure.The design for Chucky was stupid! This movie stinks, I don't care about the next sequel. No one of these characters in here are likable.So we have now two dykes in this movie who tried to sell the house and make a sister poor really dumb idea.How did Tiffany (Jennifer Tilly) come back again and not as a doll anymore when she died twice in the last two Chucky films? I can't believe the cameo role from her copied the scene from Bride of Chucky! Tiffany slit a cop's throat, she already did that in Bride of Chucky can't this movie be original? Don Mancini is a joke. Ruined Charles Lee Rays character with a s***** back story making him look a pussy. They swap the doll for the cgi so much even when its not needed and the dolls just sitting there. The lesbian scenes were pointless. Dons excuse for the no blood and the ridiculous cringe head coming off scene, was, ""Its scarier"" Don I couldn't give a s***, you can't just change the plot and cause plot holes just because you feel like. It's disgusting to the fans and honestly what's the point of even trying to show continuity through story if your going to keep changing themes.Don is not talented asshole who should keep away from Chucky. Don didn't even really create Chucky, he originally wanted Chucky to not be real and Andy be psychotic and the killer but Tom Holland said voodoo would be scarier and be more better if the doll was doing it. So if it weren't for Tom we'd have probably got a one off film of horse sh** rather than the great trilogy we actually received.When Don gets too much power he makes Chucky a joke and ruins any form of horror with pathetic comedy elements. For me Chucky scared me when i was 9 and I grew up adoring the movies. The fact he's spoiled the whole image of the past movies really infuriates me. But what's more cancerous is the fact it's his own creation he's raping. F*** Don Mancini.Screw this I watch all Chucky movies, now my marathon ends. Curse of Chucky is a trash peace a s*** movie worse than Bride of Chucky. I hated Katherine Heigl in Bride of Chucky but she was at least likable and adorable in here any of the actress is not adorable they are all awful! F 1/10 avoid this movie like a plague and another thing Child's Play 3 ended the trilogy perfectly there was no need for more awful sequels. Bride of Chucky was not needed Don Mancini did not need to make more awful sequels. Child's Play 2 had such a great happy ending this movie did not! Child's Play 1,2 and 3 are the only real good Chucky movies in my opinion. The last 3 movies are horrible f***** horrible man! This movie has also awful cgi effects.",Curse of Chucky
54,natashabowiepinky,He's bbaacckk. And more p*ssed than ever.,6,31 January 2014,"In my last review, I was speculating as to what bearing this movie would take... either violent like the first three, or comical like the two that preceded it. Well as it turns out, it's far more like the former... and all the better for it. As you'll see in a couple of my future write-ups, horror comedies are a VERY tricky beast indeed... and another Chucky film along those lines risked plunging the whole franchise into self-parody. A brilliant icon like the Chuckster deserves much more than that.Strangely enough, the biggest surprise here isn't involving America's favourite murderous doll. It's who's having an affair with the nanny of the child who adopts Chucky. All signs point to the father... but out of nowhere, our expectations are dashed. Pretty slick. Of course, Chucky has his own fair share of JUMP moments, whether he's appearing in the lift with a knife or pushing people down the stairs. And with realistic eyeballs being stepped on (Ugh) and graphic electrocutions being just some of the terrors on display, sadists are sure to be contented.So, was the big comeback worth it? The answer is most certainly a resounding YES. Is there going to be an unprecedented 7th entry? Maybe... and if they can keep up this level of quality, I hope beyond that. Just start the follow up with the scene BEFORE the credits, NOT the one AFTER. Thanks. 6/10",Curse of Chucky
55,fernandoschiavi,"Back to horror and good moments, the conclusion is also one of the best in the series not only for leaving a door open to other films but also for its pessimistic tone",6,10 July 2021,"The hopes of watching again a Chucky sequel after the failure of Seeds of Chucky had practically been exhausted. The 2004 feature not only buried the assassin's image and Don Mancini's career, it also turned the entire franchise into a laughing stock. Behold, the screenwriter made the announcement that no one expected: Chucky would star in another movie. And amidst fully justifiable disbelief, The Curse of Chucky was released in the United States on September 24, 2013, 25 years after the release of the first feature-length Child's Play. This sixth part of the franchise begins in an unpretentious way, leaving the public sure that they will see more of the same. It doesn't take long for the production to show what it's for. With a suspense equivalent to what was seen only in the original work and without the comic strips of Bride of Chucky and Seeds of Chucky, the Child's Play is back in top form.This time, we are taken to a new environment and introduced to characters never brought into the plot before. Nica (Fiona Dourif) is a wheelchair user who lives with her mother, until she supposedly receives a doll in the mail. Later that day, she finds her mother dead. The cause, according to the expertise, was a suicide. As a result, Barb (Danielle Bisutti), her older sister, goes to meet Nica, along with her husband Ian (Brennan Elliott), daughter Alice (Summer H. Howell) and nanny Jill (Maitland McConnell). Unable to come to terms with her mother's death, Nica decides to investigate the family's past. The surprise comes when, while trying to locate the real destination of the package that arrived at her house in the mail, Nica understands that the link between the doll and her family is closer and more lethal than she could have imagined.Again directed by the creator of the killer puppet, Don Mancini, The Curse of Chucky rescues the atmosphere of horror present in the three original films, released between 1988 and 1991. It embraces elements of gothic horror that give an unexpected freshness to the franchise. And that's something no one expected, especially since the last two chapters, Bride of Chucky (1998) and Chucky's Son (2004), were comedy comedies. Mancini sets aside the first half of his film to establish the atmosphere of horror, and only after about 50 minutes does he release his little psychopath to do his mischief in front of the camera. Regardless of whether Chucky acts in the shadows or out in the open, the film is full of good times like dinner with a special spice, the reveal in the attic and a certain literally shocking scene involving babysitter Jill.Going back to the roots of the original 1988 film, Mancini brings back the idea that Tom Holland imprinted on its direction. The movie tries to follow the rhythm of the first Child's Play, until halfway through the movie we don't see Chucky talking or moving as if he's alive, the puppet talks to Alice the same way he talked to Andy in the original, but here there's no reason to hide that the doll is responsible for the deaths, so we see things like, its eyes moving, Chucky disappearing and appearing in different places, and changes in the doll's expression when it is taking the form of a Good Guy, between others. Finally, when Chucky appears alive, we notice that the killer's essence is the same as the original, Chucky isn't talking much, just enough to drop his sarcastic lines. Another fact is that the doll appears with a smooth face, very different from the Frankenstein appearance that Chucky exhibited in the last chapter, will leave fans of the franchise confused at first, but everything will be very well explained. And the script even goes a step further, tying up a lot of loose ends that bothered in previous films.Unlike what was seen in movies 2 and 3, where there was a repetition of the theme, Chucky seems to have another motivation this time. It doesn't take long for the bodies to show up and it's up to poor Nica to face / run away from Chucky. And if the body count isn't the highest, at least the plot makes up for it with some pretty creative kills. The script continues in a sober way, exploring the darkness of a big house, without energy, in the middle of nowhere and with a paralyzed character who cannot escape. And if the film goes on seriously, Mancini, who also signs the script, still manages to stitch this new production together with the original work quite logically. For this, actor Brad Dourif (who has voiced the puppet since the first film) is once again seen on stage as Charles Lee Ray in very well-conducted flashback scenes. Make-up team credit.Comedy is finally dropped and gives way to terror. Do not think, therefore, that when watching the film, you will be faced with a gem of the genre in conceptual and aesthetic terms. Going the other way around, Chucky's Curse reproduces as many clichés as any other horror movie you can imagine. Tension on the soundtrack, always low lighting, half-naked women, poorly constructed deaths, keys of amazement, etc. The film comes out victorious precisely with regard to the part that belongs to it in this latifundium, I say in this franchise. It is Mancini's opportunity to kill several birds with one stone. In this film, Mancini not only manages to tie up the plethora of loose ends left by his predecessors, plug (albeit roughly) the gaps in the script, rescue Chucky's long-lost popularity, return to the scene without shame.There are some very well thought out sequences. Alice quickly becomes Chucky's new 'friend'. At a certain point in the film, while Alice and Nica are making dinner, Chucky takes a moment to put poison on one of the six plates. This one undoubtedly carries the most tension-filled part of the film. Who is eating the food with poison?... At various times the script plays pranks making you suspect the wrong person. Although it was obvious who was eating the poison (mainly because of the trailer), the scene is still tense, because the audience is wondering what will happen to the person who is eating the poison.The film also tries to deepen the relationship between the characters, this fact is due to cohesive and appropriate conversations for the moment of mourning that the family is experiencing. Barb tries to convince Nica to sell the house, as she couldn't manage to fix everything herself and it was left as an inheritance for the two sisters. The constantly conflicting relationship between Barb and Ian and Jill's involvement with Barb, the latter surprising for being a bold new thing in the franchise. All these events take place in a single night, during a storm, in a relatively dark mansion, far from everything. Very fitting, isn't it? Another point to be noted is that the story does not revolve around the puppet, the story revolves around Nica running away from the puppet, Chucky loses the protagonist status he had in the previous films (except the first one) and gains the status of antagonist. The proof of this is that in this movie we don't see Chucky talking to himself or moving around in a place where nobody sees him, besides, this is the second movie in which the puppet appears less as a murderer. This contributed to the film gaining a more horror tone.The film is not a super production, nor does it bring together a talented cast. With the exception of Fiona Dourif, daughter of Brad Dourif who played Nica at her father's suggestion, the cast is deplorable. Fiona is the one who actually manages to hold the film and quite consistently shares the screen with the puppet. Brad Dourif is as good as ever, this time showing his face in the reconstitution of elementary flashbacks in understanding the plot as a whole. Besides, Chucky's Curse doesn't bring anything that hasn't been seen again. The importance of the feature film is directly connected to the audience of the Sequel Toy Killer.The conclusion is also one of the best in the series not only for leaving a door open to other films but also for its pessimistic tone. By the way, Tiffany fans will have a great surprise in the final minutes of the film. The decision to leave the character out of the main plot was correct as she is closely associated with the more comical films in the series. However, this is clearly an absence felt by the fans. With that in mind, actress Jennifer Tilly plays for the third time the role of Chucky's fiancée and her participation, although short, serves for this new film to dialogue not only with the original work, but also with the other chapters of the franchise.",Curse of Chucky
56,gregsrants,New Life For Old Franchise,7,8 October 2013,"Chucky was always my favorite of the many serial killers that sprouted from the 70's and 80's slasher films. Sure, Jason Voorhees, Michael Myers, Pinhead, Leatherface and Freddy Krueger were all instrumental in my fascination and divulgence into the horror genre - but the possessed Good Guys doll by the name of Chucky was always my favorite of the tentpole franchises.It is hard to fathom that it was 25 years ago when Chucky was first launched into our pop culture references with Child's Play. Directed to Tom Holland on a story by Don Mancini, the 1988 horror surprised most everyone with a $35 million box office gross against a paltry $9 million budget.Sequels ensued with Child's Play 2 (1990), Child's Play 3 (1991), Bride of Chucky (1998) and Seed of Chucky (2004). Through each film, the horror seemed lessened by the increasing use of black humor scattered amongst the bloodshed.This is not to suggest that the Child's Play franchise lost its way, but it did veer off the original path. This deviation was not lost of creator Don Mancini who takes charge behind the camera for Curse of Chucky now available on VOD.In this sixth edition of the evil doll's murderous exploits, Chucky is shipped from a police evidence lockup to a home of a young woman, Nica, confined to a wheelchair since birth. Chucky's first victim alienates the young woman and when other family and friends arrive at the house to comfort Nica, it allows for a higher body count and a night of mayhem. Nica is able to put the pieces together to eventually figure the doll at the centre of the bloodshed, but her limited mobility will be both a benefit and a hindrance on her ultimate survival.We've come a long way since 1988 and Mancini has more digital tricks up his sleeve to bring the doll to life. Some might balk at the idea of a CGI motioned doll, but take our word for it, the added computer detail only adds to Chucky's evil looks. There are a few scenes where our villain gets to show real emotion using his rubber face and it is the technology that a lot of horror enthusiasts despise that is at the root of the improvements.Mancini did go back to the roots with the story that focuses more on the development of the horror rather than the slapstick funduggery that overly consumed Bride and Seed of Chucky. Replacing much of the pop culture referencing in-jokes are some tense moments of horror and some valued kills that value quality over quantity.Curse of Chucky goes places unexpected for a fifth sequel and it betters any of the films that preceded it in the series. Chucky is meaner, nastier and more patient which allows for better horror. There are some good scares in Curse and Chucky's evil might never have been better punctuated on screen. A solid story – one with flashback ties that support Chucky's choice of family terrorizing and some after the credit scenes that tie in the rest of the series – compliments the action and sets the stage for what we hope is the continuation of the franchise.www.killerreviews.com",Curse of Chucky
57,swilliky,Back to its horror roots but just OK,4,30 October 2017,"Chucky (Brad Dourif) returns with a new look, a more serious tone, and back to the horror genre though it is hard to take the killer doll seriously. Nica (Fiona Dourif) receives a package in the mail, she's not sure it came from but gives it to her mother who ends up dead. Her sister Barb (Danielle Bisutti) arrives to take care of her and brings her jealous husband Ian (Brennan Elliott), her daughter Alice (Summer Howell), and her expensive nanny Jill (Maitland McConnell). Barb wants to put her sister in a home for disabled people since she believes Nica can't take care of herself. However, Nica insists that she can take care of herself and even offers to cook dinner for the family and Father Frank (A Martinez), a visiting priest.The chili that Nica cooks turns out a bit strange thanks to the strange doll sitting nearby. Father Frank excuses himself and ends up dead with all of his limbs and head severed in a brutal car accident. Nica tries to figure out where the doll came from and hears over the phone through a bad transmission that it came from an evidence locker. She does some research learning about all the unsolved murders. Alice and Chucky have grown close as the doll whispers terrible things in the little girl's ear, finally coming alive in front of her and scaring her. Chucky takes out Jill next by pushing over a pale of water into an electrical cord shocking the nanny to death just as she was flirting with Barb over video chat. Barb goes to investigate the strange sight and power outage only to find the Chucky doll. Despite Nica's protest, Barb takes the doll up into the addict where she reveals its scared face underneath before he comes alive and stabs her in the eye.Check out more of this review and others at swilliky.com",Curse of Chucky

I really have to pay a tribute to them for trying to make something out of an ordinary horror movie plot. I thought so many times how many times I saw similar movie plots about Chucky or some other doll. Oh common, AD 2013 will be known for the movies which were either a good or bad tryouts in horror from Conjuring on to downhill.I would advise you to skip this one, unless you are so much into horror films that you have to see each and every single one of them. What a waste of time!",Curse of Chucky
60,DarthVoorhees,Oh Chuck!,7,4 October 2013,"I've had a sort of on-off again relationship with the 'Child's Play' films. I'm a horror fan and I've never considered them good horror. If 'The Exorcist' was a prime cut than Chucky would be McDonalds. And yet I can't help but get a kick out of the decent entries in the series. They are junk food horror and go for silly jump scares but when Chucky works it works well. 'Curse of Chucky' is an effective little thing. Mancini has more or less taken a look at the strengths of his previous entries and concentrated them into a goofy but creepy Halloween fun.The one glaring problem with the 'Child's Play' series is that it has never fully understood whether or not it wants to make Chucky the protagonist of it's films. The first film was about Andy and his family and it worked because they were genuinely likable heroes who we empathized with. It was satisfying seeing that little S.O.B Chucky get his just deserts. Mancini for some reason decided that Chucky should become an anti-hero of his series. 'Child's Play 2' and '3' are genuinely uncomfortable films to watch because Dourif is playing this material straight and Chucky says some genuinely hateful and disgusting things. I wonder if Mancini thought what he was writing was funny. 'Curse of Chucky' goes back to the roots and finds the right balance in the characterization of Chucky and his targets. Mancini has written a character in Nica who is more developed than one would ever expect to see in this film. We feel for her and more importantly fear for her. It doesn't hurt that Mancini has an extremely talented lead actress in Fiona Dourif. I can't tell you how much this helps the film work. Mancini isn't just going for cheap titillation with knifing like he did in '2' or '3'. there is genuine empathy to be had here. Dourif,like her father Brad, doesn't go for the tongue in cheekiness. The result is one of the strongest heroines in a recent slasher film. Good job Fiona!I have the feeling that some fans of the franchise might not appreciate this entry as much as it does not exploit the animated presence of the doll or Brad Dourif. Mancini builds the film in a slow methodical fashion and I think this is to his credit. I thought I knew how one of these things worked and yet it doesn't just play the same old notes again In many ways this could be a remake of the first film to a point and like in the first one we all want to find out what is with that doll. When Chucky does come to life it is kind of spooky. You don't often say that about the sixth film in a franchise. Perhaps this could be because the film is DTV but honestly I think it looked better than a lot of horror films in recent years. Mancini's choice to go back to basics and build suspense over the lifeless doll is kind of agonizing because we all know Chucky so well. It just makes the payoff all the more entertaining.I gave Mancini a great deal of criticism of his screen writing and directing before but here he deserves a great deal of credit for both. This was by no means an easy sell, a sixth film with a concept that is not all that amusing once it sinks in. Despite all he had going against Mancini has taken this old character and made him scary again and more importantly given him a worthy nemesis to fight.'Child's Play' fans will be rewarded here. I'm a casual fan and even I got a sense of satisfaction in seeing Chucky done right.(Stay for the end credits, if this is how Mancini intends to kill the little bugger than it is fine by me)",Curse of Chucky
61,ersinkdotcom,"""Curse of Chucky"" does a great job revitalizing the series and reminding genre fans why they fell in love with the maniacal character in the first place",8,4 October 2013,"It's been almost a decade, but Chucky's back! Universal Home Entertainment gives fright fans ""Curse of Chucky"" just in time for Halloween. There's no doubt that decades down the road, the image of the deranged Good Guys doll will be immortalized right next to the Universal Classic Monsters like Frankenstein's creation, Dracula, the Wolf Man, the Mummy, and the Creature from the Black Lagoon. Right or wrong, the ""Child's Play"" movies and their sequels have made that big of an impact on pop culture.Wheelchair-bound Nica (Fiona Dourif) and her mother (Chantal Quesnelle) live alone in a secluded mansion. When a mysterious package holding a vintage Good Guys doll named Chucky (voiced by Brad Dourif) is delivered to their doorstep, they think it's just a mistake. After being tossed in the trash, Chucky is found sitting near the bloody corpse of Nica's mother. As the house fills up with guests for the funeral, the body count rises. The malevolent soul inside Chucky needs a body to inhabit, and Nica's niece (Summer H. Howell) meets his deranged requirements. Director/Writer Don Mancini brings the ""Child's Play"" movies full circle with ""Curse of Chucky."" After two entries in the series many would call more camp and humor than horror, he re-injects this entry with a healthy dose of suspense and thrills. His choice of an old dark mansion also helps by giving the film a classic Gothic atmosphere. I would say this is the perfect balance between the original and its lighter-hearted sequels.The special effects team is hard at work in ""Curse of Chucky."" This is not the sanitized PG-13 or R-rated slasher films we saw in the late 1980s, 1990s, and 2000s. It's graphic and the gore is here for everyone to enjoy. Whether running, smiling, turning his head around, or slashing away at someone, Chucky looks fabulous.Brad Dourif is every bit as humorous as we've come to expect when he voices Chucky. You can't help but giggle every time you hear the childhood toy utter foul language and say inappropriate things. He really is perfect in the role.""Curse of Chucky"" is full of skepticism towards religion and Christianity. Chucky tells the little girl he terrorizes that there is no God several times. Nica and her mother both left the church after an obvious period of disillusionment. The priest (A Martinez) also seems rather judgmental and Nica's sister presents herself as a Christian but definitely doesn't live that way. You can take all this as an attack against Christianity or as a general example of how Director/Writer Mancini sees hypocritical ""followers"" of the faith. The Unrated version of ""Curse of Chucky"" didn't strike me as any worse than what would be considered an R-rated movie these days. There's plenty of graphic violence, foul language, and sexual situations. However, there's no nudity to be found.I'm actually quite surprised that ""Curse of Chucky"" didn't get a theatrical release. I know it boils down to Universal wanting to test the waters for their upcoming reboot of the franchise without investing too much in promotion. The film really does a great job revitalizing the series and reminding genre fans why they fell in love with the maniacal character in the first place.",Curse of Chucky
62,acidburn-10,Chucky has his edge again,7,5 November 2013,"It has been 9 years since the last Chucky movie came out, and despite being one of the few who enjoyed ""Seed Of Chucky"" which had almost no horror elements to it and instead opted for comedy, but in this one I am glad that they have gone back to basics and brought back the horror to this franchise.Despite being a straight to DVD sequel that doesn't mean a cheaply badly made movie. In fact this is one of the few straight to DVD horror movies that is actually quite decent and I was glad to see that the original creator Don Mancini was back on writing duties and I am actually glad that this movie wasn't just another soulless remake but another extension to the franchise.The storyline this time is a young wheelchair bound girl named Nica who lives in an old creepy looking mansion with her mother, then one day a package gets sent to the house and it turns out to be Chucky, and after he dispatches the mother, the sister and her family turn up and begin to drop like files.Well I have to say that firstly I loved the large Gothic house setting, which reminds me of old school horror movies, and the fact that Chucky is back to being mysterious again, just adds tension and gives him an edge again. Okay this sequel isn't without its flaws, firstly some of the acting is rather ropey at times mainly from the supporting cast, and the death scenes could have used more imagination and it also drags towards the end, but other than that this movie was pretty good and I did like the flashback scenes and the twists were well executed.The acting, firstly glad to see Brad Douriff providing the voice of Chucky again, although somewhat layed back but stole the show towards the end and Fiona Douriff was awesome as the female lead, simply a standout character and great addition to the series. Also loved the scene stealing cameos from Jennifer Tilly and Andy Barclay.All in all despite being away for 9 years Chucky is back and as cool as ever.",Curse of Chucky
63,Darkside-Reviewer,Play with this!,6,20 May 2020,"The original Child's Play movies are some of the best horror movies ever made and when they were released in the late 80s and early 90s the idea of a child's creepy ginger doll coming to life and sneaking around the house, chasing and killing people made for a seriously scary movie and even when the first two sequels added a dark comedy element into the franchise Chucky was still scary and menacing even when he's cracking jokes and spouting one liners after a kill.The later movies focused more on the dark comedy side of the series and while Bride of Chucky the forth movie in the Child's Play franchise was still pretty damn good and very funny still had Chucky be scary aswell as funny sadly the fifth movie in the franchise Seed of Chucky wasn't all that great while still having some memorable moments, funny jokes and a few good kills the movie was just too silly and over the top to ever be taken seriously and in it Chucky had become more a Parody of himself and after poor reviews by fans and critics it was nine years before we got a new Chucky movie in Curse of Chucky.I absolutely loved this movie Curse of Chucky took the series back to it's roots and made Chucky scary and menacing again while still keeping some of the much loved dark comedy aspects of the franchise mixed in. The movie does take a little while to get going and for Chucky to start killing but the lead up to it is very effective much like the original we see Chucky in the shadows messing with his victims before he reveals himself to be alive what made the original so scary was the quiet and slow build up to something we all knew was coming but still scared us half to death when seeing Chucky come to life for the first time something this movie does very well in it's own unique way.There are a couple of good kills in the movie that have plenty of blood in them my only complaint is they weren't very original and the injury detail could of been better but really it's Chucky we all wanna see and the movie more than delivers on Chucky so for the return of the classic killer doll Chucky it's well worth watching and is better than the Friday the 13th remake and the Nightmare on Street remake put together.I highly recommend watching this movie if your a horror movie fan or if your just looking for a decent scary movie to watch that's worth your time.",Curse of Chucky

Don Mancini has managed to write and direct another Chucky film and has screwed up once again with such horrible writing and direction he does here, in this one he wants to try to be ""aristic"" as it feels out of place for a Chucky film and he wants to be like Argento but he fails miserably. That chili dinner scene i totally despised as it almost went on to make people guess who is eating the poisoned chili, yet what is so artistic about people eating chili? it's a pointless scene. The acting is quite poor except for Fiona Douriff whom is quite decent for an actress who is the daughter of Brad and the child actress is poor too unlike Alex Vincent who back in 1988 was a better kid actor than her. Some of the puppetry is OK by Tony Garner but Chucky looks the worst here and looks like a Bratz doll than Chucky then reveals the scars which are fake looking with the CGI even that horrible looking low budget CGI chucky is terrible as hell. The pacing is poor and the writing is just god-awful as hell like this horrible line ""Women...can't live with them period""! i blame both Mancini's direction and writing even his bad use of camera angles. The flashbacks of Chucky's past featuring current Brad in poor make up to make him young which is painful to watch complete with some clips from the original movie thrown in.The kills are quite lame even the phony looking chin slicing which looks quite poor. In the unrated cut you get to see a cameo by Andy whom is played by 31 (back in 2013) year old Alex Vincent and was a total cop out ending which should had been the movie, it should had been a 25 years later style Halloween H2O kind of movie but Mancini screwed things up.This movie deserves zero stars.",Curse of Chucky
67,raybennetthays,Very good,8,4 May 2021,"Probably because Don Mancini knows how to direct, and it's gothic look jives with the creepiness of the Chucky doll, and Nica Pierce is one of the best characters of the series, even if the reveal doesn't jive with what we already know.",Curse of Chucky
68,RevRonster,Not a bad addition to the franchise...,6,3 October 2013,"I've always been a bigger fan of the character of Chucky than a fan of the ""Child's Play"" movies. While the character is fun, I just could never take him seriously as a horror/slasher movie antagonist. That is until ""Bride of Chucky"" came along and realized the films needed more dark comedy added to it and the formula proved to work.This one is a Direct-to-DVD sequel and, to be honest, you would know it by looking at it. It's not necessarily cheap, it just looks like how a Direct-to-DVD movie usually looks. The biggest difference (other than being the first film in the franchise to not hit the theaters), is the fact they went back to being straight horror (albeit, Chucky still delivers his killer wit). This actually was one of the things I enjoyed the least about the movie because I enjoy any movie with Chucky MORE when it's a dark comedy, like ""Bride"" or, to a lesser extent, ""Seed of Chucky."" When it first starts, the movie's story is a little sloppy and feels like it's going nowhere other than just being a generic sequel but, as the film enters its climax, the story gets great as we get to see Chucky's backstory expanded on (not to mention, it has a killer ending--no pun intended).Besides Brad Dourif as the voice of Chucky and his daughter (Fiona Dourif) playing the protagonist, much of the acting is passable but never outright terrible. Finally, the movie has a lot scenes that feel padded out in order to get the film to a feature running length and the story waits WAY WAY WAY too long before we get to hear Chucky's trademark voice.Other than a few minor complaints, ""Curse of Chucky"" is a decent addition to the franchise. It's not ground-breaking or as amazing as ""Bride"" but the film does its job of giving horror fans their Chucky fix.If you wanna hear more thoughts I have on this movie and others, you can check out my blog at http://revronmovies.blogspot.com/",Curse of Chucky
69,destroyerwod,Almost perfect Chucky movie ...almost.,8,13 October 2020,"The movie is extremely well shot, the location (an old slitghly gothic mansion) is perfect and a thunderstorm rage on during most of the movie. It fit so well. Chucky is scary again ! Gone is the goofyness of Seeds, wich is a fun (but stupid) movie, don't get me wrong, but not the direction i wanted Chucky to keep forever.That said, sadly at some point very late in the movie, it screwed up a bit. I don't want to spoil anything so i won't elaborate more, but i think that part just didn't fit with the rest of the movie wich was very dark and horror in tone. But overall i had a blast with the movie in general, the actors all did a great performance as well. I watched it at 2h30am so i could have some peace and no noise, with hearphones, and i really got into it.I totally recommand it for old school Chucky fans, and for fans of horror movies in general.",Curse of Chucky
70,richieandsam,A lot better than Seed of Chucky.,7,28 September 2013,"THE CURSE OF CHUCKYOh no another Child's Play movie. Sometimes it feels like they don't know when to let a franchise go. I like the original Child's Play movie I thought it was a dark classic 80s horror film. Child's Play 2 & 3 were both OK, but nowhere near as good as the original. Then out of nowhere after 7 years, just when we thought Chucky was gone they bring him back in the more comedic Bride of Chucky. I have to say, I loved that one. Even though there was a lot more comedy in it, it was just a great movie. And Tiffany was a nice add. Then came Seed of Chucky. Very disappointing. There were some bits in it that were good, but in general, the story and the movie is bad. There should never have been a baby doll! All of a sudden the rumours start coming through that Child's Play will be remade. I was gutted. If you read my reviews, you will know that I am not a fan of movies always getting remade. But the remake never happened instead, 9 years after Seed we got another sequel/prequel. Curse of Chucky is set after Child's Play 3 and before Bride of Chucky and it has gone back to its original roots by getting rid of most of the comedy. The film makers wanted to make this a horror film, and that is what they did.The movie has a slow start there were a lot of moments where not a lot happened and you didn't even see Chucky moving. They went for the suspense, but unfortunately we have all seen Chucky moving around and talking before so the suspense seemed wasted. The story was quite good, but there were a few questions left unanswered at the end of the movie. I wish they could have explained a couple of bits better especially the ending. It made no sense to me at all. There are a few things we could pick apart about this film, but to be honest it is a cheesy horror film about a killer doll there will be no Oscars expected here.Brad Dourif returns as the voice of Chucky Brad has been the voice in every one of the movies it just would not be the same without his famous laugh. Fiona Dourif plays Nica Nica is disabled and in a wheelchair and it is her family that Chucky attacks. Fiona does a good job. I thought she was convincing in her role and was a lot better than I was expecting. I thought she only got the role because her Dad does the voice of Chucky, but it was a wise choice. Maybe she did earn it. Other cast members were Danielle Bisutti, A. Martinez, Chantal Quesnelle & Brennan Elliott. I was very surprised by a couple of cameos too, but they were very welcome and a great touch to the movie. Jennifer Tilly makes a small appearance as Tiffany and also Alex Vincent makes a small appearance as Andy from the original movie.The main problem I have with this film was Chucky himself They changed him. I was very disappointed with his look. I loved the way the Good Guy dolls looked in the original movies, but for some reason they felt like they had to change him. It makes absolutely no sense. If you watch these movies in chronological order, it will just look weird. The main changes I noticed were Chucky's hair is longer in this movie, His lips are fuller and look huge compared to the original and they have given him eye lashes! No, no, no, no, no, no! He looked so bad. Now, there is an answer for this. I won't say what it is as I don't want to add any spoilers, but if the reason I am thinking is the real reason I don't buy it. It sucks!Apart from that, this movie is really good. The story is good, the acting is better than expected and the horror is back to its originality. It is still not scary, but the killings are great.I will give this film 7 out of 10.""Women, can't live with them Period!""For more reviews please like my Facebook page:https://www.facebook.com/pages/Ordinary-Person-Movie- Reviews/456572047728204?ref=hl",Curse of Chucky
71,baileycrawly,It's OK,6,26 October 2019,"After talk of a remake for many years, Don finally rolls out Curse of Chucky, a film that really takes advantage of the time-gap between films as an opportunity to reset the storyline, to scale back on the comedy and focus instead on horror.
The problem is that, save for those not yet desensitized to horror films, it's just not scary. We have some clever scenes here that are entertaining enough to watch, but at the end of the movie, it felt very much like a separate story that existed merely for the simple fact of making another Chucky movie. Even the ties to the other films in the series felt rushed and weak.
Overall, it was nice to get another Chucky movie at the time, but it wasn't what we were all expecting.",Curse of Chucky
72,akshatmahajan,A solid comeback,9,1 July 2021,"Curse of Chucky (Child's Play 6) is solid comeback. After back to back disappointing sequels, this part revived the franchise. It is totally dark, horror, slasher movie for which this franchise is known. This movie didn't contain unnecessary humour like last three parts.Movie is properly made. The old concept is revived beautifully. There are plenty of shocks and scares, pretty good acting and lots of violence. The direction and editing work is done beautifully. The pacing is so much good that you might not know when the movie is over.Overall, this movie is treat for horror and Child's Play fans. You are gonna love it, for sure.",Curse of Chucky
73,Donatien3,Back to Basics,9,30 October 2020,"Continuing the ""Child's Play"" franchise after nearly 10 years off, ""Cult of Chucky"" successfully brings the series back to its simpler, scarier roots.The previous two films (""Bride of Chucky""/""Seed of Chucky""), were silly, meta horror-comedies. While they were entertaining, you can only mine the self-aware gags for so long before it becomes boring.""Curse..."" is a slow-burner, but it's worth it. Chucky is barely seen (and Brad Dourif is barely heard) in the first hour, as the time is devoted to setting up the protagonist, wheelchair-bound Nica (Fiona Dourif, Brad's daughter) as she mourns the sudden death of her mother, as well as sister Barb (Danielle Bisutti), Barb's unhappy husband Ian (Brennan Elliot), their daughter Alice (Summer H. Howell) - who bonds with the Chucky doll, and their live-in nanny Jill (Maitland McConnell) - who Barb is secretly having an affair with. It's a far cry from typical slashers, where some characters are killed off as quickly as they're introduced.The pace picks up in the last half-hour, when Chucky finally comes to life and the body count rises. There's also a cameo from Tiffany (Jennifer Tilly): while she's still helping Chucky, she's a bit more restrained than the last two movies.That's not to say this movie is bleak: Chucky has a few good one-liners, and there's plenty of callbacks to the original trilogy, especially when Chucky's motives for going after Nica are revealed. It's also funny to see Fiona swear at her real-life father when Nica fights Chucky. To top it off, there's a satisfying post-credits scene with Andy Barclay, the kid from the first movie, now all grown up (Alex Vincent).""Curse..."" will please fans who wanted more scares and less meta humour from the ""Child's Play"" series.",Curse of Chucky
74,projectsgamer,Really good return to the series,8,8 September 2021,Curse of Chucky so this is a very different movie than I expected heard it was the goriest so I was seeing how the pacing would be and OMG this movie was pretty awesome this feels like the first movie Chucky does not even start to really go crazy until 45 minutes in which I believe could be the exact same time as the original child's play I do like Don Mancini direction in this I think the only thing he should have fixed was the doll in some scenes what is with the girly faces and the hair also what is with that I hate when I see that and the ending drags a little bit where you see camos they should of that did camos I do get the whole story in this I think what this movie did right was the story right about the ending when Nica is almost gonna die Chucky explains the whole story behind the original movie which I thought they weren't going to do that it worked so well made sense also you know how the rob zombie Halloween did a backstory Michael did not need a back story this one kinda need or did not it is how you look at the movie but I like the story they went for very interesting oh yeah the kills holy sh**t the kills where the best ever the eye kill the jaw kill wow they did on the suspense and the kills I was really surprised how good this was for a return to one of my beloved series it works the story works the characters are entertaining on screen and to watch it feels like the original the score is a nice return the ending does drag because of the camos they did but all after that this movie is a movie I will defiantly watch again I give Curse of Chucky an B.,Curse of Chucky
75,zac-04879,"Fun and Gory, But Nothing Too New or Noticeable",6,29 October 2021,"Don Mancini is finally moving his screenwriting and direction back towards the extensively serious horror-genre Chucky. There's no more bride, no more moments of crazy silliness, and thankfully Seed of Chucky's Glen isn't back to prevent moving ideas. Curse of Chucky is more related to the first few Child's Play films; violent slashings and intense mysteries, but it still has its flaws.The performances are the biggest weakness. The characters just aren't appealing or fascinating, resulting in a difficulty to place some care into their situation. However, the real reason behind being such dull characters is mainly left to the bland writing that was set quite poorly for them. Brad Dourif is back as our memorable Chucky, but they've really changed the horror villain's appearance in an unfortunately poor manner.You need fascinating characters to form an engaging story. The main design, following a possessed doll brutally murdering people before a hero supposedly comes along and saves the day, usually after pretty much everyone has died, gets a little tiresome. We've seen it all before. But it's reasonably entertaining and sets well where it is. Hopefully the next Chucky instalment continues without moving back towards complete stupidity.If you liked this review, check out the full review and other reviews at aussieboyreviews.",Curse of Chucky
76,MikesIDhasbeentaken,Good to see Chucky going back to basics,7,9 October 2013,"Loved the first 3 films, not so much the bride or seed of chucky... This film definitely goes back to the basics of the first, the first half of the film is pretty much the same, close ups of a motionless but creepy (and unscarred) Chucky face, who disappears and reappears but without actually seeing him move too much, the suggestion of him talking but without yet hearing his real voice, Then as soon as you hear his opening line, all that changes, and a fully mobile Chucky starts killing people off in the house. The background story is pretty basic, and the majority of the film is set over one night in the house, I liked the fact it went back to basics and will appeal to anyone that like the originals. the tying together of the story near the end was a bit silly and needless, but will also appeal if you've seen the originals, also means we get to see the scarred face of Chucky most people my age had nightmares about a couple of decades ago.",Curse of Chucky
77,kingofdanerds,"The line ""Chucky says their is no god"" cracked me up",7,7 November 2021,"2004's Seed of Chucky was a disappoint to many people. So much so that the series seemed to be dead. But, in 2013, we got the first Chucky film in nine years and the first to be direct to video, Curse of Chucky. Curse of Chucky would be written and directed by Don Mancini (writer of the previous Child's Play films) and stars Fiona Dourif (True Blood). Not many people were really anticipating this film before it's release but upon release it received widely positive reviews from critics and audiences alike and did a decent job with DVD sales. So much so that the next film would be released in 2017.Nica (Fiona Dourif) is wheelchair bound and has been so for all of her life. When she receives a package that has the Chucky doll inside, her mother is killed and her sister's family comes to visit. But what happens when you have people in a scary house with a killer doll inside of it? I think we all know......Curse of Chucky sees a return to form for the Child's Play series. Bringing the series back to it's dark and creepy roots. No meta jokes or jokes in general. Which is funny because Don Mancini wrote and directed Seed of Chucky and so it is really nice to see how Mancini has grown as a director here. What makes Curse of Chucky interesting is that it does not ignore the previous films events (in a sense). This is a sequel in the same continuity as all of the previous films, including Seed of Chucky. Yet, sadly no Glen/Glenda in this film. That is not to say that some of the lore get's meddled with. Without going into to much detail, all I can say is that it is very apparent and viewers who are well versed in Chucky movies will notice right away that some of the lore is meddled with here. It's a little annoying. Like in the first film, Chucky is mostly kept in the shadows until about half way through the film. Brad Dourif returns to voice Chucky and he does not disappoint. Now, I cannot say this is his best performance, it is still really nice to have him in the film. Now, the Chucky doll is what just makes me scratch my head the most. Most of the time when the doll is still, it has this silly opened mouth look to it that I cannot simply take seriously. There are a few moments when the doll looks creepy while staying still, of course, minus the silly opened mouth look. The Child's Play series has been known to use animatronic work on the Chucky doll but another bizarre thing about this film is that there are instances where CGI is used. Like, I know this film's budget is not much but come on. It just takes you out of the film for a short instance. With that being said, there are some rather good jump scares throughout the film. Up to this point in the series, this has to be the goriest one in the series and some pretty good effects along with it. The setting of the film really benefits from the tone and gives us this closed in environment that has the characters no where to run and hide. The acting is probably this film's biggest weakness. Having taken acting classes myself, I feel like I am sitting in said class and watching people perform in a horror movie. Do not get me wrong, Brad Dourif and his daughter Fiona Dourif are the best in the film and I think Fiona Dourif's character Nica is a good character. But I could frankly care less about the other characters. While the crappy sister character was probably intentional, we get far too many scenes with just her.Fans of the original Child's Play trilogy, more specifically fans of the first movie, will most certainly be pleased for the most part with this film. Just don't expect it to be any better than the original.",Curse of Chucky
78,DustinRahksi,What a piece of....Trash,5,2 October 2013,"When I first heard this was coming out, I got a little excited. I love Chucky, and the more Chucky, the more better. These films have always been bad, mostly on purpose. But this film is just plain bad. It tries to actually be a horror film straight up, but that also is the down fall of the whole film. Bride and seed were the height of the character, you wanted him to succeed. But here, I actually didn't like him, wow these writers ****ed up hard. Chucky is my favourite horror character, but I hate him here. He's is not funny, he is certainly not scary. It's a travesty.The plot sets up a big house with a lot of people in it. You'd think it would have a cozy Friday the 13ish feeling, but no, the characters are all seem to hate each other, and there is little development or interaction. They are lifeless, and don't say they are like that because of the dead mother, she never comes up again after the opening, no one seems to care. The film for the most part is relatively boring, and when Chucky finally does come out to play, he is never likable. The kills are few and far between, they are never worth the wait. Considering I bought the unrated version, I thought it was going to be pretty violent, but no. I don't know, maybe it was for the better, considering horror films these days going over board with the violence. This felt tame like the first three films.The plot twist, this was another huge gripe with the film. I know Charles Lee Ray was a psychopath, but him wanting to be a family man, what? What about Tiffany, considering how much she liked him, why would he be going after some random middle class family. These flashback scenes really disturb me for some reason, I don't approve of them at all.The dual endings. The ending for Nica was idiotic. The police believe that a woman in a wheelchair could possible do the things she was charged with, is just stretching the BS to unbelievable lengths. What about Alice, she could vouch for Nika. The fact that they even have the same Chucky doll that has caused so much carnage over the years sitting in the courtroom, and nobody, not one person believes Nika, yeah okay. Then there is the after credits ending for Andy. More of a fan service considering it doesn't make any sense. Before the credits rolled Chucky was transferring his soul into Alice, without the pendant I may add. So did he transfer or not, why was he still a doll when Andy took care of him with a shotgun. Why is Tiffany still working with him, where is Glen during all of this, why doesn't Chucky bleed when he gets hurt. Why? WHY? WHYYY? It's a very bitter disappointment to the franchise. I still recommend viewing it for yourself, to form your own opinion.",Curse of Chucky
79,FKDZ,Attempts at being scary but failed at every other aspect.,3,1 October 2020,"So after watching the last four movies I found myself also wanting an actual scary movie with chucky. And this movie starts off promising, great main actress (Fiona Dourif), scary house out in the woods. The actress is bound to a wheelchair. So these elements could all be fantastic to make a really suspenseful and scary movie (as scary as a good guy doll can get..).And yeah, it does succeed at it a few times, and it definitely focuses on building some characters and has a ton of fake-outs and suspenseful moments. But I guess I'm going to be one of ''those'' people as well because the moment the animated chucky was revealed I was out of it. His face changes completely from his static model. He has some god awful eyeliner and weird lips. Just none of it works for me. In some shots he looked oddly fat and in others he was skinny again. Just really sloppy.Now the facial animations and animatronics are definitely better. No doubt, but they also use some really questionable CGI. And it's not so much the lighting of the CGI Doll, but the way it moves is very unrealistic. The most memorable scene of bad CGI was where Chucky was walking down the attic staircase, ruined the scene for me.Second, Chucky has a real lack of lines, and most importantly funny / vulgar lines. I couldn't come up with anything memorable he's said in this movie. Just the way in general they presented him and the scenes he had are mediocre at best. I'm not one that is extremely picky and into details but in the previous movie they specifically mentioned the dolls couldn't drive cars due to their size but apparently in this movie Chucky could rev the engine whilst sitting behind the wheel..The reveal of the new backstory of okay-ish, but kind of overwrites the events of the first movie where Charles Lee Ray wasn't running away for the reason the first movie stated.Oh and I can't forget the kills, well. they're there I guess, some cool practical effects for the husband but mostly just kinda meh, Chucky is not as menacing/cruel in this. (like the school teacher scene in chucky 2)3/10 definitely wouldn't watch again, no humor, no fun, awful looking chucky, mediocre scary elements, bland kills.",Curse of Chucky
80,krycek19,Best one since the original,10,29 September 2013,"This is totally different from every sequel made so far. It has Brad Dourif in it as a human, where he is far scarier than as a doll. It has Alex Vincent as an adult (he played Andy as a boy) it has a meaner Chucky who speaks more than he kills people. And who is looking for revenge. The director and the producer of the original is back in board and it tells by the high quality of this movie. It deserved to be shown in cinemas but I guess the quantity of all the sequels including number two and three didn't did this pretty good horror flick any favours. Al though it is made by Universal Studios.",Curse of Chucky
81,utahman1971,No Continuation After This,9,27 September 2013,"I don't get why people don't keep the movie going until the very end. Spoil to alert those who think that there is a sequel after this. It is the last, unless you think Barclay with a shotgun at chuckys face and blown off, will bring him back.Like I said if you watch past the credits and seen it say ""Six Months Later"", you would of known this without speculations of a sequel. The next one is a remake of the original. You would known this too, if you read the internet about these movies, and was a fan of these movies.Why em I the one that has to explain these things when people in these reviews cannot do research first before saying anything? Apparently they are not true fans of the series or just lack of really trying to be a fan. Anyways great continuation and ending to the series.I would be surprised if there was a sequel, but for what I just explained. It makes no sense in a sequel. I would like to see the remake when it is released. Hope its no PG-13, because they are the lamest remakes for horror genre as you can get. Ruins the whole horror aspect of things.How can someone actually say a horror movie is evil with PG-13 rating, when there is no language, no nudity, and no gore? Easy compared to a TV-14 rating and no commercials. The only thing different is commercials. Lame like I said. Not worth the so called money to see it in a theater or cable or rent.This one should of been in the theater for Halloween. Too bad great movies are straight to DVD or Blu-Ray rent.

82,tequila101,Chucky's Back with a big Slash!,7,23 January 2014,"When I first saw the trailer for this straight-to-DVD release, I did not even think to believe that this film was to be any better than the previous which had come. I thought this film was going to be cheesy and just not exciting. Again, I anticipated what was not...""Curse of Chucky"" may have had it's flaws (which it has some), but for me it was a kill-joy ride into seeing the crazy, sadistic doll we know and love since 1988. Now 25 years later, he's come back with a big slash to a victim's backside! Before I properly start writing what I liked/disliked about the film, I would first like to say that Don Mancini, the cast and crew did an excellent job of bringing Chucky back to his horror roots, and attempting to make the concepts and elements of the story and doll creepy/suspenseful. I would say this it's an improvement over both ""Bride and Seed of Chucky"", though I still didn't find this film too scary for the most part. I also knew that this film was not going to match up to the ambient suspense of the original 1988 horror flick which I still cherish today. I also didn't find this one to be better than ""Child's Play 2"" or ""3"".So firstly the bad sides of this film (I'd rather get this done first):1: The aspect I noticed most is that Chucky is not remotely scary or frightening. He sometimes appears as a game model while at other times his head's the size of a turnip. His clean look doesn't look to great, where its too plush and playful. His clean look needs to play off the themes that he can be a frightening vision. The stitched look was a slight improvement. Brad Dourif's excellent voice talents for the doll are the only thing that keep Chucky going.2: The only other small problem I would have to state about the film, was that when the filmmakers were working on production, there was note that the film was to be set after ""Child's Play 3"" and to be a prequel to Bride. And then there was info flying around that it was just set after Seed. So the film at times made it a little unclear whether it was set in the mid 90's or if it was the 2000's but then again, when I saw cell phones and laptops it quickly striked me that it was set in 2013. Weird hey....On to the positives for this film: 1: Firstly, the film's soundtrack score now composed by Joseph LoDoca is just magically listen-able. It's one of the best soundtrack scores I've heard in a while and especially for a Chucky lover like myself, I was having high expectations on the soundtrack score. The last Chucky film to have good to decent music was probably the 3rd one, then again the last really good time was the 2nd one. He does an excellent job of creating a creepy atmosphere with the soundtrack score, whilst adding various elements I found which include; ambiance, circus, creepy, bouncy kind of stuff, and even a bit of funky rock with chimes. There were many elements of the music which made it a joy to listen to. My favorite parts of the music especially are the 9th and 19th tracks of the album. I found it to be very Danny Elfman like.2: The actors were a well-rounded cast and did good at what they did. Their death scenes were also funny (not so scary) to watch as Chucky seemed to have pick up a thing for hurting people's eyes. But overall I just think that Mancini worked well around the characters to develop them to the full extent that they needed to be at, in order for us to do the typical thing that many horror fans do. Love or hate certain personalities and root for certain characters to do hideous and horrifying things to our conscious expectations. I especially loved Fiona Dourif's character as I felt I was able to connect closely with the way she was feeling about her mother's death, as well as what she thought about Chucky and her well out of whack sister.3: The location was a well picked choice and quite a wise one at that. Very spooky and creepy house, just standing on it's own where elevators, attics, bedrooms, wide hallways and open spaces is all the necessities of a building a suspenseful atmosphere and putting the victims in danger. It was great to see this because there also hadn't been a great location for a Chucky film in a while since ""Child's Play 2"". They just kept it simple which I found nice this time.Overall, that is all I can say about this well made, and quite rich sequel which unexpectedly hit audiences with many surprises. I once read an article that someone had stated ""that it was the best direct-to-DVD film they had seen, and it was saying a lot"". I tend to agree with the person who wrote that very much because it's also the best of straight-to-DVD horrors I have seen. For example, the ""Wrong Turn"" films (3-5) all sucked hard. I also find it hard to believe that ""Curse of Chucky"" would not get a cinema release, but instead ""TCM 3D"" would hit the cinemas??? That film was terrible where it had no depth at all.But anyways, ""Curse of Chucky"" deserves a 7/10. It's not an award-winning flick and certainly isn't the best or the brightest of the bunch of horror films (as well as in it's own franchise), but it is a step up from most recent horrors I've seen. Give it a try... You may be surprised what pops out of the box.",Curse of Chucky
83,Simon_Says_Movies,A Shockingly Efficient Franchise Revival,7,14 October 2013,"Often pushed to a second tier among other iconic horror franchises like Friday the 13th, Halloween and Nightmare on Elm Street, the murderous misadventures of Charles Lee ""Chucky"" Ray have been just as persistent and influential as those other game changing series. But Chucky, so too like Jason, Freddy and Michael, these characters have had their fare share of missteps in terms of quality, and in many cases saw their franchises descend into unintentional self parody. The Child's Play saga has seen a similar trajectory, with the 1988 original still standing as a horror classic, it's immediate predecessor coming off as passable but more or less a carbon copy and the third as a junky, bland mess. After a seven year hiatus, the surprisingly satirical Bride of Chucky arrived along with a perfect Jennifer Tilly as Chucky's partner in slaughter. Things again took a turn for the worse in Seed of Chucky which aimed to amp up the camp of Bride but it came off as a grating and, ironically, childish. Almost 25 years on we now get Curse of Chucky, a direct to home video instalment – a rather unceremonious release which certainly did not instil confidence in this horror fan. Well, you can consider my mouth shut as this is not only a strong, well crafted fright flick, it's easily among the franchise's best entries. Curse of Chucky takes the more gruesome elements that worked so well early on, some of the parodic flare of Bride and then even goes on to subvert horror norms and cliché. This is a film that knows firmly where it stands and the expectations of its audience and uses those preconceived notions to surprise in a number of ways. The biggest and most pleasant realization I made from the onset is how well crafted Curse of Chucky is, from the art direction that brings life to your typical isolated home (at which our bloody events can transpire) the composition of shots which expertly use every angle in the book to bring complexity to the carnage and its generally polished look. It certainly doesn't bare any resemblance to most home video fare that looks as if it were shot in somebody's basement. But the accomplished aesthetics only serve as the launching point for some clever prods at the genre, some fun kills and a thorough grasp on its own franchise roots. One of the things Curse of Chucky is finally able to figure out is how to present an adult protagonist that would believably be in peril when facing off with a pint sized doll. Our heroine comes in the form of Fiona Dourif, daughter of Chucky's voice, the iconic Brad Dourif (whose cackling laugh still brings a weird smile to my face after all these years). Daughter Dourif's Nica you see is confined to a wheelchair, putting her quite literally on even ground when the climax rolls around. There is a young girl about, who serves as the vessel through which Chucky's evil rumblings are heard, but this is more about Nica, and it all works rather well. In the end, it really comes as no surprise that this entry is penned and directed by Don Mancini who has written every entry in the Child's Play franchise. Even though he is so close to the series and its central character, he has clearly taken the time to step back and re-approach his baby in new ways. It's not something you see too often from someone who has been involved with something for so long. Then we get the funny, subversive elements to the story which plays against our expectations, such as the role of a promiscuous nanny, who gets the knife and when and fake-out scares and potential deaths. Constructed in the way it is, Curse of Chucky should easily please fans of the franchise but also win over general fans of horror who are tired of seeing cookie cutter productions. There are certainly conventional elements at play, but it's all pulled off with a great deal of flare. As for Dourif's Chucky, he's as vulgar, funny and creepy as ever, and even when delivering more simplistic lines reminds us why the character has persisted. There will certainly be some who will overlook the more clever elements of Curse of Chucky and hone in on what remains ordinary, but for me it was time well spent and easily introduces a new spark to the franchise and shows there is life yet in everyone's favourite killer doll.",Curse of Chucky
84,WatchedAllMovies,No better than previous ones,4,22 January 2014,"If you've seen the previous Chucky movies you know what to expect from this one. There is basically no plot. Well, OK there is a little plot, created to give Chucky a reason to kill people.I was hoping that despite having no good plot, it would at least have some good special effects, but disappointingly, this is a low budget production, possibly because the producer knew he wasn't going to make a lot of money from this movie.There is no CGI special effects. Chucky is mostly a puppet in this movie. When he talks his lips don't sync with his dialog. There is one scene where I think he was played by an actor in a costume. The scene was shot from the top down to hide the actor's true height but it still looks very strange.I kept hoping the sequel would be better because it's hard to get worse. But this one didn't get better. It's more or less the same. Come-on, how hard is it to hire a writer to create a more interesting plot?",Curse of Chucky
85,Minus_The_Beer,Curse is a Blessing,7,13 October 2013,"Curse Of Chucky (2013), directed by Don Mancini. 95 minutes (unrated cut: 97 minutes) Plot: Proving that you just can't keep a Good Guy down, everyone's favorite homicidal maniac-trapped-inside-of-a-doll, Chucky (voiced by the indispensable Brad Dourif), has returned for more shenanigans in ""Curse Of Chucky."" This time he's landed in the lap of wheelchair-bound Nica (Fiona Dourif), herself hosting a houseful of grief-stricken family members. In an all-too-familiar fashion, members of her family start mysteriously dying in a variety of grisly ways, casting suspicion on the little red-headed chunk of plastic in the corner with a vacant stare and an inexplicable grin splashed across his face. As the clock winds down and the body count rises, Nica is in for a number of surprises, as are fans of the ""Child's Play"" franchise. Friends 'til the end indeed.Writing and Directing:In the wake of 2004's ultra-meta ""Seed Of Chucky,"" writer/director Don Mancini keeps the plot clean and clutter-free with ""Curse,"" letting the tension and bloodshed do most of the speaking. To that end, the film is more horror than comedy, calling back to the Tom Holland-helmed cult-classic that made us all so paranoid of Cabbage Patch Kids and their ilk 25 years ago (!). Mancini, who has written every single on of these films to date (and directed ""Seed""), has his finger firmly on the pulse of what his fanbase wants and delivers in spades. You want a more stripped-down flick where Chucky returns to his patented brand of sneaky slaughter? You got it. Do you want references and call-backs to film's past that will put a smile on your face? You get that too. Just make sure you watch the WHOLE feature. Franchise politics aside, Mancini does an excellent job of squeezing as much atmosphere out of his set-pieces as possible with a limited budget. The film looks and feels like a theatrical release, when it was clearly intended as a direct-to-video affair from the get-go.Cast: Fiona Dourif is a revelation as Nica. A regular chip off the old block, Fiona resembles her dad not only on the surface, but also in her ability to effortlessly pull off a complex character with limited means. Hopefully we will be seeing more of her in the future. The man himself, Brad Dourif, gets a significant amount of screen-time not as Chucky (who barely utters a line until half-way through the movie) but as Charles Lee Ray, the notorious Lakeshore Strangler from way-back. We are treated to a great deal of flashbacks that wrap around nicely with the franchise's origins, and not only does Dourif still look the part, he gleefully embodies the role with all the necessary venom and vigor. The rest of the cast is serviceable if forgettable by comparison, barring a few 11th hour cameos that will have any fanboy (or girl) clamoring for more.Music: Joseph LoDuca's score works well for the most part, but can get a bit cumbersome in its final act. It's a far cry from the Graeme Revell and Pino Dinaggio works of yesteryear (or even the heavy metal assault of ""Bride Of Chucky""), but it gets the job done.The Bottom Line(s): ""Curse Of Chucky"" is, in many ways, everything a fan could want from a sixth ""Child's Play"" flick. Mancini knows this franchise better than anyone else, so trust that you are in good hands. Relax, close your blinds and put your toys away. Chucky's back.Lesson Learned: Never accept large parcels with no return-address, lest you be supplied with a shotgun and plenty of ammunition.",Curse of Chucky
86,Michael-Hallows-Eve,"A very worthy sequel, and it ties the story together.",8,17 October 2013,"This film I actually liked a lot. It is a sequel in ways and it has the original actors from the original films in it too, which is a total bonus. The movie links all the other Chucky movies together in its plot. I was watching this and found myself flashing back to when I saw the original movie, I had fun watching it, and I was quite surprised to how good it actually was. There are some great cameo roles in it too (not telling you who they are though). Like I said though, how it ties the other movies together is very well done. If you are a fan of the first movies, then you should like this movie just as much, I did. It has some great bloody moments, and some cringe worthy moments also. Also, keep watching after the credits, there is more to the story there. I give this film an 8 out of 10.",Curse of Chucky
87,CowherPowerForever,Chucky Is Back!,6,24 September 2013,"This review will have some major spoilers so be warned before continuing.I'm a huge fan of the Child's Play/Chucky franchise and in my opinion the only movie in the franchise not even worth a watch is Seed of Chucky. Thankfully we get a film here that is not on that level but sadly is not on the level of some of the other good films in the franchise. If I had to rank the films after this movie the best is still the original, then part 2, then Bride of Chucky, then Curse of Chucky, then part 3 and finally Seed of Chucky. So good addition but nothing fantastic here.Director and creator of Child's Play/Chucky Don Mancini returns after making the awful Seed of Chucky but I do give him a lot of credit this time around for making a much better film when compared to the last movie. As well he is the writer of the film and he does deserve some blame for having a pretty bland script that can get very boring at times. For example we don't see Chucky make his first kill until about the 50 minutes mark. The film itself is only 96 minutes(92 minutes without credits). Some thought we would get that feel from the original film and while the feeling is much better we don't get that feeling of the original film at all. Instead we get a lot of present day horror with jump scares. Another problem was bringing back Jennifer Tilly as Tiffany. The idea while shocking and a nice twist didn't fit the film at all and felt like they threw it together at the last minute.Before the release there were concerns of the look of Chucky when he was moving around. You can tell for sure the budget is much less here as Chucky just looks more fake than in the past. But in my opinion it doesn't take much away from the film at all. Chucky still looks amazing and hardcore fans of his like myself will still love seeing him again.Overall the film is in no way perfect but it feels so much better than Seed of Chucky. Hardcore fans of the series will enjoy the tone a lot especially after having to wait about 15 years since the last time we saw a good Chucky movie.",Curse of Chucky

90,rarepeperonis,meh,4,19 September 2019,"As for the modern sequels loved Bride and Seed but this one did not do it for me.The kills were boring (The sister stabbed in the eye really? i wanted her to get an horrific death this was very anticlimactic, Chucky trying to suffocate her in the garage instead of just??? killing her quick he had the uphand on her) , the cgi obvious and horrendous especially when he comes down the stairs in the latter part of the movie, i prefer when chucky is operated by puppeters. Gone is the humor they establised in the 2 last installments now it's a generic doll horror movie, anyone couldve directed this it's nothing spectacular in the screeplay or script.This movie is missing Jennifer Tilly so bad, you see her for 15 seconds at the very end and that's it.Chucky seem to transfer his soul to the little girl but in the end credit scene he's back in his doll body at Andy's place.... very confusing.Did not enjoy it very much 4/10",Curse of Chucky
91,alexcomputerkid,This film will end up being one the biggest surprises of 2013 and maybe even in horror movie history.,7,6 December 2013,"To say in 1988 that we were going to have a horror film about a doll as a killer that later spawned a successful series would seem unreal. No doubt it would be interesting but very silly regardless and also a risk film due to the possible bad reactions to it. Still as history showed, Child's Play was a hit and it made it's mark on the horror world. It was the first movie in a popular series that still has nothing close to it in the horror genre.That said, now in 2013 after nine years, we get a new Chucky film. The whole idea is again forced, questionable and asking for trouble. The series already faced it's fate if it wanted to be a black comedy film like the last sequels or edgy horror like first two movies in the late 80's and early 90's.Curse of Chucky uses only one set and obviously was made with a smaller budget. A small package has been sent to the home of wheelchair-bound mother Sarah Pierce (Chantal Quesnel) and her daughter Nica (Fiona Dourif). The package containing good doll Chucky, which of course always leads to trouble.We have seen this type of plot before with a house in the middle of nowhere but with the Chucky films, you can say that it's a little different. The movie uses it's budget here, introducing more characters than usual with ""Clue"" vibes and these characters all bring something unique to the table and that's something different with this series.Obviously, the main reason why these films are successful are the main attraction, the doll Chucky who is the center of attention and he leads all ships to these films. In this installment, Chucky is not as funny as previous and he seems to show up when he wants to but he is still the same Chucky. He does bring fresh and new kill scenes which I liked. Brad Dourif does his usual good voice work for Chucky and Chucky does have a new look which gives him a little different vibe than before.Once the third act is about to come to a close and the DVD player is about to turned off, we see that the ending is ambitious and wants to do a lot of things. It takes you in many directions so you need to follow it all but still though, this is a very different ending for the series. The ending is smart and an example of how a movie can go against the grain in a direct-to-DVD film. It also gets bonus points for a cool cameo that pays homage with characters from earlier films in the series.Like most sequels, this really is an unnecessary film and for a series that returns after almost ten years, this should not have been very good especially considering that it is a direct-to-DVD film, but it was good. I think this film will end up being one the biggest surprises of 2013 and maybe even in horror movie history.",Curse of Chucky
92,med77_99,Chucky goes downhill,2,4 November 2013,"I had very high expectations for this movie, especially being a fan of the original Child's Play movies. I was let down with this one for several reasons, first, it does not explain a lot of some of the events that happened in previous films, total disregard to the previous films.the direction and script were awful, and i was surprised that it was made by the same people behind the earlier movies. total amateur work here, direction of the movie was below standards, cheap and boring camera movements.the script and elements of thrills and intrigue were laughable, at a certain point, Chucky poisons a single plate of the dinner food of the family, and the director rotates the camera between each person as if to make us guess who was poisoned. very lame and old school stuff. the dialog was terrible as well.special effects were also pretty lame, as some already mentioned here, the Chucky doll keeps changing in the way it looks, at points it had long hair other times a bit shorter. when the toy comes alive, it was lame as well. as a movie made in 2013, it is terrible.acting was decent, the lead actress was pretty good.plot elements were mesh mashed, they tried to add some background story to Charles Lee Ray the criminal who is trapped inside of Chucky, it was boring and uninteresting.MINOR SPOILER ahead Chucky wants to transfer into a human body, this time a girl's body, which was odd, why would Charles want to move into a female body ? END SPOILERA very very weak entry into the series, and probably one that would put it to rest permanently "" maybe a good thing ? "" , the Chucky films truly goes downhill with this one, one of the worst in the series and probably one of the worst films of 2013. I really i cannot fathom the positive reviews here.Avoid",Curse of Chucky
93,moviesmaniax,The best Chucky film in the series since Child's Play! // instagram: moviesmaniax,9,8 September 2014,"The best Chucky film in the series since Child's Play! With director Don Mancini who directed Seed of Chucky which turned the genre into more of a comedy than horror and pretty much is the most disappointing film in the series for most fans. Now he is back again with a more straight-forward to horror version of Chucky and he did an excellent job than expected. The GORES here are pretty intense and bloody that still lives up to Chucky's legacy even though some of them did look pretty fake due to a lower budgeting I guess. The SCARES here was surprisingly spooky with a old school haunted house style thanks to the great cinematography and lighting which really raised the quality bar of this film. Don Mancini did a great job in fulfilling the expectation the fans had when they first saw the trailer and here's how:(SPOILER ALERT BELOW!!) First when we saw the trailer there had been many arguments about the non-stitches and stitches Chucky whether which one is better but as we saw the film, Don did put both versions up and satisfied both fans on both sides which I think was a very smart move to do, plus both versions look badass and has its own likable point. Also we got to see the first time since Child's Play that Brad Dourif actually appeared as the human role of Charles Lee Ray since and as a huge Chucky fan, I'm really pleased about that. If that's not enough, we also got ourselves a badass cameo scene from Jennifer Tilly at the end, PLUS a grown-up Andy Barclay cameo at the very end credit exceeding fan's expectation even more. Chucky's plan on Nica character here is also probably the meanest one in the series as being the reason for her disability for over 20 years. (That's not a very nice thing to do, you know) (SPOILER ENDS)The only thing that might be disappointing about this film is probably the CGI Chucky but I understand since it's a straight-to-DVD budget movie so if this was to be released in theaters, I'm sure this problem will be solved. Overall as a huge fan of Chucky, it's a great FUN to see Chucky back again in a scarier and more badass version that is brutally violent with gleefully surprises proving that Don Mancini has the talent and guts to direct the Chucky films once again. >>A-<<",Curse of Chucky
94,CrisMovieCorner,Chucky is BACK!!!,7,12 October 2014,"Yes, there was another instalment in the ""Child's Play"" franchise after that horrific ""Seed Of Chucky"", I mean come on? That film was absolutely appalling it was neither a Comedy nor a Horror even Don Mancini said it wasn't Horror he actually believed it to be a Comedy. Boy was he wrong! Curse Of Chucky takes places pretty much completely over the space of one rainy night in a manor that is filled with family members going through a tough time. Nica's (Fiona Dourif) Mother has just passed not long after the household received a Good Guy's doll in the post. Her sister Barb (Bisutti) and brother-in-law Ian (Brennan Elliott) come to visit with their daughter and live-in nanny Jill. All these people under one roof, resulting in Chucky coming back to reek some havoc as he has done many a time before.I as originally worried about the film, it felt like another milking of Horror franchise, straight to VOD, Mancini signed on to direct again after his directorial debut when he destroyed this franchise with ""Seed Of Chucky"" so having reservations in an understatement. Putting those problems aside Mancini brought us a film that went back to the beauty of the early stages of the franchise and focused on the Horror and not the Comedy however there is still a few giggles given to us by Dourif as always.The film does so many things right, even with its couple of flaws, the film is incredibly paced with writing to match that with some beautifully blood-soaked fun and little quips that will satisfy any true Horror fan out there. The kills are impressive and the film has a very much 80s/90s vibe that saved a franchise after ""Bride"" and ""Seed"".Overall, the film has a great vibe about it, I recommend you do NOT underestimate this film, even though it is a direct-to-DVD/VOD release it doesn't lose its charm we are given with early instalments in the franchise. Full of gore, twists and jumps, the film will leave you wanting more which is being given to us. Mancini has expressed his desire to make some more ""scary Chucky films"" with the seventh instalment not far away from entering production.",Curse of Chucky
95,alucardvenom,"Has lot of flaws, but it's somehow entertaining.",4,26 September 2013,"After years of silence, new Chucky sequel came out? So was it worth the wait?Well, kinda. Honestly I wasn't all that looking for it, because I was never fan of the series and consider even original not to be that great, but just entertaining flick. And this one is no different.It wasn't all that great, some parts of it very kinda dull if you think about them, and some scenes seem to drag a bit too long (dinner scene) with no real payoff. Some dialogue was bad, and most of the characters very unlikable, but on the movie's defense, it had good actors to pull it off. I must say that I was rather impressed with Fiona Dourif's acting. She goes into many emotions here and it's clear that she picked up some of her father's acting genes (Brad Dourif, who plays Chucky, sadly the awesome actor who never had misfortune of starring into some of the worst movies out there). Hilariously, I couldn't stop laughing at the thoughts of ""Brad with boobs"" every time she showed up on screen, because her face looks exactly like Brad's, only bit prettier (naturally). Now when it comes to the story, it stars off fine, but it becomes mess as the movie progress. It's filled with some of the genre clichés, but luckily, they will probably not bother you that much - you are after all, watching XYZ sequel to Child's Play movie, which probably means you're either horror fan or fan of the series, so you're use to those typical clichés like lightning strikes, jump scares (which aren't many), one of the character (or characters) being complete idiots and oblivious to what's happening.Characters aren't very likable, not even Nica (played by Fiona). I am sorry but I couldn't relate to her and honestly, I didn't care what was gonna happen to her. On the other hand, this roll allowed Fiona to show her acting skills. Her sister Barb is played by Danielle Bisutti, who was excellent, but her character is so horrible (complete B) and annoying that I couldn't wait for her to die (if that was Don Mancini's intention, then he did a fine job, but I prefer characters in the movie that I watch to be likable and not wanting them to be just cannon fodder for high body count).The only likable character was Jill, played by beautiful Maitland McConnell who I haven't seen since that hilariously bad ""Ninja Cheerleaders"". It's always nice to see her, because she's both talented and beautiful and definitively needs more rolls.Now, when it comes to movie logic, it's all over the place. It's basic concept is that one of the original, but movie falls apart in this regard in one totally forced flashback which tries too hard to tie in original movie with this one, and if you just think about it a bit, you'll see how idiotic and nonsense that is (it also ruins character of Charles Lee Ray - he was suppose to be cruel and sadistic, not psychotic and delusional). Worst thing about this unnecessary flashback is fact that it completely stops the movie for about five minutes. It also annoyed me that one of the characters becomes Exposition Guy, which again turns into a problem because movie tries to connect to original.Dialogue is bit clunky, especially when it comes to unnecessary Chucky's one liners which aren't funny at all. They are just annoying. There's only one that made me smile, and it wasn't even typical one liner. There's a cute cameo by Jennifer Tilly, which again, doesn't make any sense if you think about it (unless movie pretends that other sequels never happen and completely fallows the original) but I thought she was hilarious, so I forgive that one.Brad Dourif is excellent as always in both regular acting and his voice acting. Little girl was also good. I usually hate little children in movies because they are mostly annoying, both in character and acting, but she was fine. Music was good, I liked the theme song and some other songs played. Movie never became too loud and rely on loud noises to jump-scare you, which is excellent - your ears won't bleed. Effects are descent with mix of practical effects and some CGI (fortunately, there's not whole lot of them, maybe two or three times that it happens).Also, note that tone of this movie is more like back to the roots, it's darker and more serious then it's latest few sequels (mainly Bride and Seed). With exception of few Chucky's one lines, there's wasn't any humor in it.",Curse of Chucky
96,cornflakeboy20,"Return to formula, in the best sense",6,27 September 2013,"Curse of Chucky is better than most horror movies that get a theatrical run. The staging is rather small, with a small unknown cast and a limited location, but they make the absolute best of everything they have. Brad Dourif, the original director, and another important cast member from parts 4 and 5 appear; and this movie actually seems like a return to the formula of the original movies, using some of the surprise and humor of the last two. A woman caring for a disabled daughter, and living in a lovely Gothic mansion, receives the Chucky doll anonymously. After being quickly dispatched, the rest of the family arrives to take over the estate from the daughter. Among them is a little girl, who adopts the Chucky doll. The parents of the girl seem to have ulterior motives and a strange relationship with their babysitter, which is later revealed as a pleasant and humorous twist. Chucky begins killing off the victims, using the creepy mansion as a great backdrop. The camera work is great. The suspense is good. There are some great kills. This movie does not look cheap. Its only VOD concession seems to be that it sticks to the same location over the same night, and changes settings only rarely. The last entry seems to largely avoid parts 4 and 5, although it does not erase them completely. Often, horror movies that deviate from formula come out disastrous, but Chucky reinvented itself as a series with Bride and Seed of. Fans of those movies may be disappointed this doesn't pick right up where they left off. Still, it's a nice surprise to go back to the pure cheesy formula horror of the first three movies. The ending, of course, leaves room for a sequel that could play off the theme of the movie, and revisit dangling threads from the earlier series. Well worth renting, streaming, buying.",Curse of Chucky
97,JontheLobsterLover,The best of both worlds,7,25 September 2013,"Being afraid of Child's Play as a child, I grew up loving and being a big fan of the franchise. This movie feels like it's played in two different parts.The first half is for the people who love the original three films. You get the non scarred Chucky. Always hiding behind corners and running across doorways. The face isn't of the doll isn't exactly what remembered but it all makes sense later in the movie. The suspense is good. The kills are nice. It really makes you feel like you're watching the originals. When Alice is first under the sheets with Chucky and he speaks, I had to go back and watch it again I love it so much. The second half of the movie feels like it's playing more for the Bride and Seed fans. It reveals that Chucky had a mask over his scarred face (which makes sense why the face looks different in the beginning the other other films). I have to agree with everyone else that when he walks down the stairs in that first scene as scarred it looked pretty bad. But with a straight to DVD release you have to look past stuff like that. It has a few one liners, nothing near like Bride or Seed. I loved the flashbacks and connecting the original with this film. I love when they give you a little more information on something you already know. The flashbacks alone made me a happy Chucky fan. The music also played a huge part in why I enjoyed this film. The opening music as it circles Chucky on the chair, amazing. If you listen closely you can even catch glimpses of the original Child's Play music in there. Jennifer Tilly's cameo is more on the Bride and Seed vibe, but that makes sense because that's the two she was in. You definitely get homages to Bride in these last scenes. The last scene with Alice kind of leaves things up for your own speculation which I like. I have my own thoughts of what actually happened. The acting was great except for Danielle Bisutti. I understand you're supposed to hate the character, but I was hating the actress playing the character. I thought she was horrible. Fiona Dourif was great. Like father like daughter. Some of the shots were a bit over acted, and some of the dialogue have you rolling your eyes a little. But over all great acting on everybody's part.Finally the very very last scene, post credits. I found that to be the ultimate nod to the fans. Besides the flashback this is the only other thing that really connects the first and last film. Yes Alex Vincent isn't amazing, but who cares. It's the fact that he's playing Andy. Plus you have his mom on the phone and he asks about Mike. Pictures of Kyle, and the original picture of him and his mom. The line he delivers to Chucky wasn't the best, but who cares. A good Chucky film for true Chucky fans. Great job Don.",Curse of Chucky

99,jpasols,No More Comedy! The TERROR is back!!,10,25 April 2019,"Curse of Chucky is the 6th movie of the Child's Play franchise and after the series' comedic phase with Bride and Seed of Chucky, Curse of Chucky brings back what the original 3 films had! It brought back the HORROR elements! The slow burn terror of the original, the twisted and creepy comedy like Childs Play 2 and 3 and even makes BIG connections with the original two Childs Play films. Half way through this film there is a flashback scene to the toy store shoot out from the original movie! The main girl in this 6th Chucky movie is actually connected to Chucky as well as her family! You'll have to watch the movie for a clearer understanding of that, but seriously this movie is amazing! Chucky is back and really IS better than ever! I cant believe this sequel got a lot of harsh negative reviews! It did everything right that the original had going and this film actually felt a lot like original too. Andy Barclay even makes an appearance in this film at the very end. Chucky himself is more menacing in this film and creepier looking, he definitely got a new paint job to cover up those scars in this one and he looked terrifying!. Pretty much all of the cast members did a great job too with acceptable acting but an OUTSTANDING performance by Fiona Dourif (Brad Dourif's daughter). Not surprised there since she IS Chuckys REAL daughter!!. Which is ridiculously cool!. Some scenes in this film relied too much on CGI so sadly that did irritate me throughout the movie. There were also several parts where Chucky looked like a cartoon character because he was overly CGIed or you could tell he was being played by A REAL person. So those things really annoyed me the most about this film. Other than that this is a pretty solid well done Childs Play sequel. 10 out of 10 for me I highly recommend to horror fans and Chucky fans.",Curse of Chucky
100,cstover-28468,A Welcome Return to Form,8,19 June 2019,"After getting a couple of, for lack of a better term, silly entries in the Child's Play franchise with the ridiculous yet hilarious Bride of Chucky, and then the somehow even more ridiculous Seed of Chucky, the series finally decided to head back to its horror roots in Curse of Chucky. The film is set in a large, seemingly somewhat secluded house with a main female character, Nica, who is confined to a wheelchair and lives in this giant home with just her mother. One day, they receive a package in the mail seemingly out of nowhere, containing a strange ""Good Guy"" doll. After the sudden ""passing"" of her mother, her sister, along with her sister's husband, daughter, and live-in nanny, all come to stay with Nica for the time being as she mourns for her mother and tries to figure out where her life goes from here. What ensues is nothing short of classic suspense and horror from the one and only iconic killer doll, Chucky. While some of it may come off as just more cliche ways to see Chucky do what he does best, most of it works. The suspense is decent and the kills are as creative and brutal as ever. All in all, this is an excellent entry into a long-loved franchise and a refreshing return for the series back to its horror roots. If you're a fan of the Chucky series or just a fan of the horror/slasher genre, give this movie a shot and I'm confident that you won't regret it",Curse of Chucky
101,guillermobosque,"Curse Of Chucky delivers a compelling story, quality performances, and a memorable post-credits scene.",8,5 July 2015,"Summary: Curse Of Chucky delivers a compelling story, quality performances, and a memorable post-credits scene. 81/100 (B+)After the events of Seed of Chucky, Nica, a young woman forced to a wheelchair since birth, has to regroup her sister, Barb and her brother-in-law, Ian for a funeral after the death of her mother. While dealing with Barb, Ian, along with their 5-year-old daughter, Alice; Nica receives an odd package - a creepy doll. After people start showing up dead, the fearless Nica soon suspects that the creepy doll is much more than just a doll. Curse Of Chucky was a fun movie that surprisingly exceeded my expectations, it left me very impressed. The star of the film was Fiona Dourif, she did an excellent job with her character, the rest of the cast was generally good. Brennan Elliott and Danielle Bisutti were the only ones who did not give a solid performance.If you are a fan of the Child's Play saga, you must see it. Curse of Chucky is a fun, violent and bloody ride. Even though it was flawed, stupid, and manages some clichés of the genre, it is still an enjoyable flick. It uses some CGI effects, but I really don't care, the doll looked realistic enough. The new design of the doll was remarkable, Chucky looks scary again! Moving on, the first act was a bit slow for some people, because the doll does not speak. He said his first words until the second half of the film. During the first half we can see him walking through the rooms, moving his arms, frowning, etc. This could be boring for some people, but it was effective and suspenseful to me. I loved how the movie built up the tension.I liked the setting of the film, the house was creepy. The score was great too, it increased the suspense at times. The movie kept the tension all the time. I was so interested in the plot and characters. Don Mancini's direction is imaginatively clever, the movie made me feel intrigued and amused. On the plus side, we have an impressive return from the cast of the previous installments; also, the performances were pretty good. Fiona Dourif gave an awesome performance as ""Nica"". Brad Dourif did Chucky's voice, he was excellent as always. I also want to add that I spent my whole childhood watching the Child's Play franchise. I am a huge fan of these movies, and I absolutely loved this one because it knows what fans want.Even though it has some silly moments, Curse Of Chucky surprisingly delivers more tension and seriousness in comparison to its predecessors; Chucky is creepy, strong and revengeful again. I will not spoil it, but there is a great post-credits scene that you don't want to miss, it was completely unexpected for me. If you're a huge fan of the Child's Play saga, you will love this movie. Also, in the second half of the film there were so many surprises, and some questions about Charles Lee Ray (the spirit who lives inside of Chucky), will be finally answered. On the negative side, the movie has lots of silly and stupid moments, and some of the characters were so dumb. I still enjoyed it though. (B+)",Curse of Chucky
102,oldman007,Everything I wanted in a Chucky Movie...is all in this movie.,10,31 October 2013,"I have always been a fan of Chucky. I loved all of the Child's Play series. The weakest one for me was Seed Of Chucky, but it wasn't terrible.Here we have Chucky's whole family introduced. Not only do we have his family introduced, but we have more of his past revealed as well. All the Chucky movies have all been so different and Unique in their own way. It's different because in ""Curse Of Chucky"" Chucky kills people in so many bizarre, different ways than what he did in all the other ones. And he didn't speak much, which, in my opinion gave it a bit more of a thrill. And we get to see Chucky run around from head to toe, which was never done in any of the other ones. And the fact that everybody from all the other films have been included in this movie.This Chucky movie is definitely my Best Chucky movie since number 1. I doubt any other future Chucky movies will get better than this. I'm giving this a 10/10! Chucky's Baxk and he's ready to play! By the way, watch until after the credits, Chucky comes face to face with an old friend.",Curse of Chucky
103,HorrorFreak1997,"6/10, very enjoyable entry in the Chucky franchise.",6,20 April 2014,"The last Chucky movie was released in 2004. It was an alright movie but went to overboard on the comedy and left fans of the series, for the most part fairly upset. So 2013 rolls around and to our surprise we're treated to a direct to DVD child's play movie. This time Don Mancini gets things back on track. He treats us to a much darker and more serious child's play entry. Also as a cherry on top he ties the film in with the first three child's play movies and bride and seed of chucky. This movie is a real treat for all the chucky fans out there.The movie itself is certainly not a masterwork but for a child's play film its one of the best for sure. As i have already mentioned the tone is much darker and the story is taken much more seriously. This is a refreshing change for the series and feels like it's the right direction for the franchise to move in. The characters in the film are all fairly unlikeable except for the main character Nica, but hey! I think we're all really rooting for chucky at this point in the series, so it doesn't really affect the film in a major way. And it really is fun to watch chucky get to work in this movie. As well for the most part the acting is good enough to not distract the viewer, so i don't have a complaint there. Of course the acting could have been much better but it's a slasher script. it's not supposed to be an Oscar worthy movie so we don't exactly need Oscar worthy performances. The score is good for a child's play movie but i felt it could have been a little more suspenseful in some scenes. We also get some good gore, and fun deaths.I have a feeling this movie is going to set the child's play franchise back on track. Gets a solid 6.5/10 from me.",Curse of Chucky
104,sucraf,WTF with spoilers,1,3 October 2013,"is this the same universe as all the other child's play movies? i thought chucky can get hurt? that is why he has scars. in the last movie if anyone remembers he got really ""hurt"". haha. also there were only 2 good scenes of death and one was caused by the after effect of chucky. also, when chucky ""about a size of a 2 year old"" attacks no one tried to defend or fight him except the female lead? Also when u get poisoned, make sure u leave eruptly and drive away? also poison only makes u sweat? only the priest remembers old chucky stories? really? a doll maybe involved in killings and a lot of people died. also there was a laptop with video of chucky alive? i guess the police who collected all the evidence missed the laptop? and what is with the little girl and chucky? he tried to possess her? and then nothing. also the girl wasn't that young, so when a doll talks, u don't have a problem with that? and the very end after the credits was really stupid. chucky was delivered to andy. then chucky started to cut himself out of the box. how did chuck know andy wasn't looking at the box? also andy could of opened the package right away? chucky could risk all that? stupid. why didn't chucky just attack andy at night when he was sleeping?",Curse of Chucky

106,jwtrox08706,"Flawed, but definitely breathes new life into the franchise.",7,20 January 2014,"After being extremely let down by buying Seed of Chucky almost ten years ago, I went into this direct to DVD/Blu-Ray installment with more caution than I did with its predecessor.Curse of Chucky surprised the hell out of me. It is well cast, cleverly written considering the source material, and the editing is pretty good, too.Fiona Dourif carries the lead role extremely well—like father like daughter. And how poetic that she is the movie's heroine opposite Chucky/Charles Lee Ray, played and voiced by her father Brad. Brad Dourif, of course, was brilliant. Brad is Brad, really. The man is an actor who clearly enjoys his craft. It shows that he totally immerses himself in his roles.The writing left some things to be desired, but it shows strong effort. Certain aspects of the story I will not reveal in this part of the review, in case anyone reading this has an intention of seeing this movie and would like to know if it is worth taking a chance. The way I watched it first was renting it on YouTube for $2.99, and if anyone is wary of any movie possibly being bad, I highly recommend that method. However, I got way more than my money's worth, I think. The ending is sort of where the movie stalls out, but it's still worth the time and a few dollars if you want to rent. I'm actually considering buying it on DVD or Blu-Ray, though.*****SPOILERS BEYOND THIS POINT***** The movie contains interesting twists to it. I could tell the main filmmakers, most of which have been part of this franchise from the very beginning, were serious about breathing new life into this franchise. In this age of disappointing remakes, reboots, and sequels coming long after their predecessors, this one is a pleasant surprise, for lack of a better term.Where the movie falls apart somewhat is the ending. After all the chaos, Nika is left on the floor in the house holding the knife in a rather incriminating situation when a police officer goes to the house to question the family on the death of a priest who had been at the house before he crashed his vehicle as the result of being poisoned and was killed in the crash.Where things don't really add up is the fact that Nica is implicated, arrested, and found mentally incompetent to stand trial. She is subsequently placed in a facility for the criminally insane. Now, the issue is she was charged with the murders based on all sorts of evidence minus video footage from a nanny cam placed on Chucky by Ian. That footage implicates Chucky in the murders. We see Ian, who initially thought Nica was killing everyone, go through all the footage of it, and finally see that Chucky was the culprit. Of course, he finds out too late. Certainly that evidence would have been found, and if Ian could figure it out from watching that video footage, so could an investigator.Aside from that part, the backstory as to why Chucky is killing people in the family is pretty well done. We see how he knows them, and why he's come back to kill them.Also, the ending plays very similarly to the beginning of Bride of Chucky—it's even quoted. Jennifer Tilly (as Tiffany) pops up in the back seat of the car with the crooked cop carrying the evidence (Chucky) he was being bribed to give to her.Still, despite these flaws, I say give it a watch. If you're a Chucky fan, definitely go for it.###",Curse of Chucky
107,Mileskolehmainen,"Decent, but suffers from Large scale syndrome.",10,12 October 2014,"What I meant by the ""Large scale syndrome"" is a problem I see in lots of modern horror sequels, and regular horror films too. It is basically when a film promises a big-stage, action-filled show, and gives us a small-scale, darker film, with minimal kills. So don't expect those things, and this film is an effectively scary and stylish horror flick. I do prefer an inner-city family home for a scary Chucky movie, but the old, isolated, slightly dilapidated house in this film was decent. The effects are very good for the most part. I don't know for sure, but it looks like Chucky has CGI enhancements in some scenes, and I do think the puppetry and animatronics in this film work much better. Chucky looks okay too. His design is still quite scary, but he looks too plastic. The plot takes a little while to start, but once it gets going it's quite compelling. Curse of Chucky is also quite scary. It finds a way to be just vicious enough to scare you, but not enough to be distasteful. The plots twists are also very disturbing and really add to the Chucky mythology. So in all, Curse of Chucky is a decent film. Not as good as a few of the old CP movies, but better than lots of the crap horror that comes out today. P.S. My real rating would be a 6.6/10, but this movie needs to move up a star. It's underrated here (on Rotten Tomatoes it's rated 80%)",Curse of Chucky
108,noway234-1,Chucky got Lucky,9,22 October 2013,"Childs Play 1 Terrified me and made me uneasy around dolls for a week. Childs play 2 entertained me but didn't make me scared about dolls. Childs play 3 bored me cos they just lost it. Bride of Chucky delighted me with it's dark humor and great scares. Seed of Chucky made me laugh for hours with it's meta humor.I say this at the start so you know a mild version of my history with this series. I've seen every single one, I love every one (Except for the 3rd) and I think it's one of the cleverest horror franchises around because it keeps evolving and changing. They're not the same style, they go along different story lines, they break new boundaries and try new things.And this is the one that I believe to be the best of the bunch. In terms of scares, this one beats every other one. They use Chucky only when they need too, they don't have him speak until almost halfway through. Even though we're 5 movies in, even though he's on the DVD cover, even though you will go into this movie knowing full well that it's Chucky... somehow it maintains tension and the doll never becomes a cheap joke. And yes this is a sequel, they do a simple and brilliant reveal to confirm that it's set after the other films. Brad Dourif is in top form, his vocal performance always sell's Chucky but this time it's like he went to an even darker place to make the voice even creepier. He refuses to hold back and creates a performance that's completely terrifying.His daughter Fiona is a perfect foil to him, playing terrified in ways I didn't imagine possible. She sells her role, owns every second of it and genuinely makes you believe that the doll is real.If you want to see a truly scary Chucky movie that fires on all cylinders and doesn't hold back for even a minute, this is the one for you",Curse of Chucky

A new family receives chucky by post like how it was done in child's play 3 there isn't any explanation to how chucky is back this time though. It's good to see they went back to chuckys horror roots with this entry rather than the comedy thrown in with the last 2 movies.Feels more like a reboot than a sequel with how much footage is shown of chucky being alive and trying to take over a kids body again. The kills are pretty nice though and it's not a boring watch. They did change the design of chucky a bit in this for some reason instead of going with the bride/seed of chucky one, but how he moves is really well done.

That said, of course the filmmakers use stereotypical element from horror and especially puppet horror movies (I always wonder why kids seem to like horrible looking monster puppets and not the nice looking ones). But there are some nice camera shots and killings in this kind of a reboot since everything is told again, even Chuckys birth (in a flashback). Curse of Chucky is part a introduction to a new generation of Chucky ""fans"" (if there are any) and part a revision of the elements for which the series is most known.

112,xodanielcasterox,Decent comeback but disappointing payoff,5,1 October 2013,"When Chucky first appeared on the big screen two kinds of people had very different reactions; some people are scared of him, some people have seen this kind of concept before; the whole killer doll thing. I personally was SCARRED by him. Then the sequels spawned and I have to say as bland as some of them get he still creeps me out. Until he did Seed, the most non-scary and unfunny sequel ever! Now we have Curse. I like it okay. It was nice that they gave us back the old Chuck-ster we know and love. They actually tried to make it creepy again and the first half actually was pretty damn creepy even though we've seen it. Doll appears, doesn't do much for awhile, suspense suspense suspense, the whole cliché. But it still has some problems that I really need to address. First of all, the acting isn't all that spectacular. The only person who was trying their hardest is Fiona Dourif, Brad's daughter. Don't get me wrong, he tried his hardest as well. As always, for that matter. Anyway, the character's are not that interesting, they use the same scenes from the original film like tucking the child in bed with the doll. They use CGI for the whole puppet to move in one or two scenes instead of using a midget in a chucky outfit like they did in the original. One of his victims gets killed when chucky spills water on the floor and electrocutes her. Now, here's the problem: the water on the floor electrocuted her because it spilled on an outlet where her laptop is plugged in. Who the f#ck puts an outlet on the floor? Did they not think that if they did that it would be a terrible idea if it rained and they had a leak on the ceiling? or if they spilled their drink on the floor? Is there a real good reason for placing an outlet on the f#cking floor? If so, please explain it to me. They never explained why Chucky chose to be a killer in the first place. They never dive into the psychology of his behavior, that would be nice for a change. But make his back story unpredictable. And of course, the ""Im gonna get you"" line. It's dated as hell! Stop it! After the end credits, they gave us a surprising returning actor. Alex Vincent, the kid who played Andy Barkley from the first two films is back as Andy once more. Cool. It was cool to see him again and he does finally get to keep in touch with his mom. But the payoff in that epilogue is a little goofy. It's not strong and it's very comic bookish. I wish he carried the leading role again, that would've been better.All in all, it wasn't good nor bad. Just okay.Oh, I almost forgot. The doll still looks f#cking creepy!",Curse of Chucky
113,worthythorn24,"Believe it or not, Chucky is scary again",7,9 October 2013,"I must commend everyone involved in the making of Curse of Chucky. After seeing the series slowly evolve into satirical horror I never thought it would be possible to turn Chucky into a true horror villain once more. After the failed attempt to do the same for Freddy Kruger in the NOES remake I had very little hope for this film. That slight glimmer of hope quickly changed when I pressed the play button on my remote. For those of you who have not seen the movie yet it opens with Nica (played by the rather lovely daughter of Brad Douriff himself, Fiona Dourif of True Blood fame) receiving a rather mysterious package in the form of everyone's favorite pint-sized serial killer (sorry Leprechaun). Nica, who happens to be a paraplegic, lives with her mother Sarah. Before long, Sarah ends up dead from an apparent suicide while Chucky quietly watches Nica sobbing from a chair.Soon thereafter Nica's family shows up at the home to pay respects and settle her mother's affairs. The family consists of Nica's older sister Barb, her husband, Ian, their daughter Alice and their live-in nanny Jill. Slowly but surely the family members disappear or die leaving only Nica to face Chucky and figure out why he decided to terrorize their family. A lot of people seem to be disappointed by the big reveal, but I feel like despite being somewhat trite it added a layer to the legend of Charles Lee Ray that had not been explored before. The movie ignores certain aspects of the previous 2 films, but stays true enough to the original story along with keeping bits and pieces (pun intended) from Bride and Seed of Chucky. The death scenes are nothing new, but brutal and effective enough to be worthy of the Child's Play series. At times the CGI is a little suspect, but the film only had a $5 million dollar budget. After viewing the film, which by the way is alarmingly good for a direct to DVD sequel, you will wonder why this was not given a theatrical release. I have a feeling that if it turns a profit this may reignite the Child's Play franchise. Chucky is the creation of writer/director Don Mancini and it's good to see that he still knows how to stir up the scares after the disappointing Seed of Chucky. Curse of Chucky is a slow, atmospheric horror film and that is a rarity in the post-Saw days of the genre. Make sure to keep watching after the credits for an awesome Easter egg which may play a pivotal role if they decide to continue the franchise. Curse of Chucky is definitely worth owning and I give it an enthusiastic 7/10.",Curse of Chucky

Watched it again the other night, and I have to say, it's my 2nd favorite out of all the ""Chucky/Child's Play"" movies (the first one being my favorite). I like all the movies in the series, but, like ""A Nightmare on Elm Street"", after the first movie, which was really pretty scary with only a little humor, they decide to progress with the humor and gore for each new entry, but cut back on the scare factor. This entry really gets it back to its roots --- gothic, creepy horror........and, in the ""unrated"" version, some fantastic gore effects. The cinematography is tremendous, giving the overall look a sense of dark, foreboding things to come.......and boy, do they! The acting by everyone involved is wonderful, with Fiona Dourif really shining through.....wow, is she ever good! But they all are, even Summer H. Howell as the little girl is amazing.....and for such a young actress, that's quite an achievement. And, LOL, my partner and I loved all these movies, and watched this one many times, but never all the way through until all the credits were over, and you get the ""Six Months Later"" scene (I think it's only on the unrated version).......what a surprise! Sadly my partner passed away from cancer this year, so he never got to see that segment, but would have absolutely loved it and probably would have applauded.

A mysterious large parcel is delivered with Chucky inside, unimpressed with the gift, Sarah dumps the doll in the trash bin (something that Chucky experiences quite a lot over the years). Suddenly Sarah is found dead and the grief stricken Nica gathers the rest of the family together, her condescending and obnoxious Sister Barb (Danielle Bisutti), Ian the Cuckold Husband (Brennan Elliot), Jill the Attractive Nanny (Maitland McConnell) Innocent Alice (Summer Howell in her debut movie) and Father Frank (marvelously​ played by A Martinez). They share all the memories and stories and had Dinner until Father Frank leaves to go back to St Paul's Church in a hurry in strange circumstances, after he is gone the family caught sight of an unknown stranger who is actually the Human ""Chucky"" Charles Lee Ray the Lakeshore Strangler in Ray Ban sunglasses in their old tape reels, when Barb and Nica's Father mysteriously drowns like Vivienne van Pelt who's body is found in the river (Chucky mentions her in Bride of Chucky) as possible offerings to Damballah who is the west African and Haitian Serpent God of rain and water surroundings. As Nica has hunches and notions that led her to play detective as she explores deep into the realms of urban legend and scary camp fire ghost myth about a particular doll possessed by the angry and vengeful spirit of a Voodoo practising Serial Killer, she makes more gruesome discoveries as the film continues as she finds out Charles Lee Ray took an unhealthy interest to her heavily pregnant mother, Sarah, back in the Eighties as flashbacks.Don Mancini can make masterpieces which is why Chucky flicks are a movie goer's most watched saga in every country as the most enjoyed entertainment. This is a brilliant, apologetically​ brutal, and dazzling sequel that is better than Bride and Seed, you can get away with watching Child's play 3 and go straight to watching this and you can still catch up on the story. Good music score and lighting, I love the setting of the haunted house feeling and pan angle shots, the best is the Dinner scene like a Russian roulette, and you see artsy shots of chomping mouths guzzling the gazpacho wondering who is going to die and the cast is teasing the audience, the death scenes are creative and well thought through with effort put in to create the film. Chucky displayed clever premeditated revenge as he continues to keep his promise since the original movie and still wants to claim a human body to transport his soul. Fiona Dourif puts on an incredible performance and is emulating her Father in this movie, her beauty and heroine role resembles him in looks and intensity in one flew over the cuckoo's nest. Watch out for the surprise ending after the credits roll which will lead us to ""Cult of Chucky"" as the next sequel",Curse of Chucky

122,utslitt,Not bad,7,9 July 2019,"It was nice to see a new spin on Chucky after so long, as well as have a little more story revealed to why he was running from the police all those years ago. The movie takes itself way more seriously than it had in the last two films prior (Bride and Seed) and I'm beyond grateful for that as it brings a more dire, tense tone to the movie that is much needed. The story picks up where any other Child's Play film would have, Chucky is out for revenge, as always - but it's the new characters and the delicate approach to re-establishing everything that make this film truly shine. Curse doesn't acknowledge the previous movies in a ""breaking the fourth wall"" kind of way as Bride did, but rather in a manner that helps the new story we're witnessing develop, making things much more serious for our new victi-...er, characters. :p This fantastic movie brings life to an older franchise in quite a favorable way, and I absolutely suggest you see it if you're a fan of the original Child's Play film.",Curse of Chucky
123,rocky_lifter69,This Is More Like It,6,4 October 2015,"I've always had a soft spot for the Child's Play series. Living doll stories can be very creepy and there was a decent amount of these moments in the early movies. The concept may be rather stupid but I loved that the first two movies played it straight. The third one drifted a little more towards humor but still had it's moments. Then the two ""...Of Chucky"" movies threw all that out the window and went completely for comedy. 'Bride' and 'Seed' were as misguided as they were bad. Curse of Chucky brings the series back to it's horror roots and delivers a fairly effective little film.Chucky is mysteriously delivered to the home of a paraplegic young woman and her mother. After the mother is murdered, her sister and family come to mourn and the woman's niece becomes attached to Chucky. As the night rolls on, she becomes more suspicious about where the doll came from as it creepily seems to appear and disappear around the house. She begins to unearth the history of Charles Lee Ray and soon the body count starts adding up. I'm not saying this movie is an all time horror classic nor will it likely convert anyone that hates the Chucky series. But this is head and shoulders above the last three movies. There are some nice nods to past films without going too overboard or obvious (a big sin of modern horror remakes/reboots/sequels) and even a nice tieback that explains Chucky being delivered to these women. They even found a clever enough way to explain Chucky's lack of scars from the previous movies. There's just the right amount of blood and gore and the acting is pretty solid for a direct-to-video horror movie. I was pleasantly surprised by Fiona Dourif, daughter of Chucky's voice actor Brad Dourif. And Brad himself once again brings the right amount of murderous glee and menace to the evil little doll.I often rant about modern horror movies, with the overabundance of PG-13 slop aimed at tweens and the lazy cash-in remakes/reboots trend. It's refreshing to see an old character without any ""re-imagining"" or other crap going on. Throw this one on if you need something to watch this Halloween. You could certainly do much, much worse.",Curse of Chucky

And you won't be disappointed if you want to see Chucky's attitude shine through.It isn't the continuation of the previous movie some might be expecting but it's an excellent yarn that will satisfy both fans and newcomers.I would even say skip the first movie completely.

127,imdb-783-507847,Chucky's back... and yes it IS something to be happy about,6,30 September 2013,"The Review (Contains Mild Spoiler):It's been almost 10 years since the last Child's Play film graced our screens and it's fair to say a lot has changed since then. Freddy, Leatherface & Jason have all returned, only to fall foul of a fate much worse than their teenage prey- the box office Goliath's of the Saw and Paranormal Activity franchises. In fact in this world of cheep scares and found footage jump shocks, Child's Play seems very... 90's. So can the now 25 year old little demonic doll franchise compete with the shaky cam shocks of modern horror? Well yes. Just.The Story: After her mother's mysterious death, Nica begins to suspect that the talking, red- haired doll her visiting niece has been playing with may be the key to recent bloodshed and chaos.Director Don Mancini has been responsible for all the Child's Play films to date, from writing the 1988 original and the heavily publicised Child's Play 3 directing the less well received Seed Of Chucky (2004) so it's only right that he should bring the devil doll back once again to cause chaos. For the most part he does a bang up job. The film's tense at times, and builds a good level of suspense working as both a sequel to the earlier Child's Play films and a reboot to kick off a whole new franchise. Okay so it does feel a little long and the kills are a little too long in arriving but for a second time director Mancini does a good job. It's also fun seeing (and hearing through the voice of the returning Brad Dourif) Chucky back in action, be it rat poison or the usual carving knife. The film is also expertly shot, with some glorious cinematography for what is a very modestly budgeted a DTV sequel. The story is simple but effective and throws in some nice curve balls near the end, which sets the franchise off in a promising new direction. However for all the good and fun this film delivers, the biggest issue is the film just isn't bloody enough. You don't expect more than a few cheap jump scares (which even those are few and when they do arrive signposted a mile off) but an early beheading sets a grisly tone that the film doesn't quite pay off from, leaving it feeling like it needed a little something more. The film just feels a little safe at times.But just as you start to wonder if bringing Chucky back was a good idea, the knife comes out and the blood flows once more and you remember how much fun it is seeing a 3 foot high doll stalking adults to their inevitable and grisly death. In conclusion: it's good to see Chucky back in action but you cant help but ask the question, is this a film 10 years out of place? Is this an old school late 90's early 00's horror movie that doesn't quite fit with the world how it is now? But then you find yourself asking, what would I rather watch? Someone throwing a camera around, inducing motion sickness for a half arsed jump scare 80 mins into a 90 min film OR a psychotic, possessed demon doll pushing a woman in a wheel chair off a landing or electrocuting a baby sitter? And with that in mind... I can;t wait for the next one.",Curse of Chucky

129,white_fire4,"MUCH better than the last two, a very good return to what made Chucky great",8,24 September 2013,"Curse of Chucky is by no means a literary masterpiece, even by horror standards, but what it does, it does well.The story focuses on Nica (by no coincidence, I'm sure, played by Brad Dourif's real life daughter) and her harrowing experience. One day, out of the blue, a fairly large package is delivered containing Chucky. He looks just a tad different from his original form, but still very much the same.Moving on...Nica's mother dies, prompting her sister, sisters hubby, child and nanny to come over and console her. And general mayhem ensues from there. There are some neat little twists with the characters, and Chucky himself is genuinely creepy once again, thank god.Sadly, the one thing this movie suffers from is it takes a good long while for Chucky to be Chucky. Yes, we see him a lot, we see very small signs he's alive, but he doesn't say anything until the 45 minute mark, and we don't see his face animated at all until then either. We don't see him actually up and about until about 5 minutes after that. Once he does, he's great, but the movie takes just a bit too long to bring him in.There are, of course, plot issues with the movie and extremely convenient plot holes (ie phones don't work, cell phones can't get a signal, yet somehow they can connect to the internet to do research on Charles Lee Ray and the Chucky murders involving Andy, convenient wheelchair in the closet, characters run to the garage and could escape, but don't to go back and find the little girl) The lighting and atmosphere in the movie is superb. The music as well is incredibly good at setting mood and keeping tension in the movie, and for intensifying the scares.The connection with the first movie is fairly well done too, if extremely subtle with some details.Sadly, this movie does not ignore bride or seed of chucky, and despite the fact that the movie is all around good, it feels the need to remind us about the last two piles of crap with the ending and jennifer tilly doing a small cameo, of course being the one who mailed Chucky to begin with.The very final scene is...odd, to say the least, and brings doubts to Chucky continuing in any way, shape or form past this movie.",Curse of Chucky

Only let down by a desperate need to tie into previous films in the series resulting in occurrences that don't make much sense. In particular is the inclusion of Jennifer Tilly. When she first appears its in a reenactment of the opening scene from 'Bride'. So that begs the question as to when this film takes place. We clearly see Nica use a smart phone near the beginning of the film so its not the late 90s when 'Bride' took place. And is Tilly playing herself or Tiffany? Its all unnecessarily confusing and drops the ball for an otherwise well made and tense little movie. Well shot, well acted, great design (the house is a Gothic wonder) just a bit of excess baggage.",Curse of Chucky
131,janvl0412,Chucky's back for some action... or not.,2,25 September 2013,"Personally, my favorite movie from this series is ""Bride of Chucky"". The campy humor horror made me wish for a sequel about every two months. I'm not sure it'll be easy to get another sequel after this one though I dread the thought. The dialog and acting in curse of Chucky is somewhat soapy if you get my drift, and a little slow-paced. The doll looks duller, most of the effects were better executed more than twenty years ago, and the lighting and make-up give the film a telenovella look. I mean, the kid has a single piece of glitter stuck on her face for half a scene, and the skin problems and surgeries are too apparent. Though Brad Dourif was somehow convinced to play the character again, his wig looks about as real as Barbs lips. In one scene the lead actress even seems to be having something stuck in her nose. I'm just saying, a viewer shouldn't be aware of these things. The film does pick up the pace somewhat but only after 45 minutes. Don't get your hopes up though, it never gets close to any of the other movies. Please bring back the style of movies like Halloween H2O, Bride of Chucky, Scream 1 and 2,... I think there's room for a revival of the genre. It could replace torture porn as far as I'm concerned. I was really looking forward to this movie. Sigh.

After the past few movies, I was growing skeptical, and worried that they might not have something redeeming. I have to say, the movie, despite the somewhat poor acting, it was more or less satisfying. During the course of this movie, my attention was grabbed, and thrown back into the greater days of old.

134,fire-lizard,A big improvement over past instalments,9,9 October 2013,"I have always been a huge fan of the child's play films with the exception of Seed. This film however brings back the franchise by going back to it's roots and also adding some twists that makes this film stand out.For a direct to DVD film, it was a very well made film. Brad Dourif returns as Chucky in fine form both as doll and human form. Along with many other members of the cast including his daughter Fiona. All of the main characters are very well written so the film becomes more than a typical slasher film where you are just waiting for these people to be killed.It's hard to make a horror icon scary again when so many people are familiar with them but this film does not fail with that when they redesigned him and left out much of the overuse of camp that made Seed so unbearable. The kills can be a little over the top but that shouldn't put any horror fan off watching it.The story is the best thing about this film. The first half of the film makes itself seem like it was just following the story of the first one but the second half gives out some extreme twists, suspense and a surprising after credits scene as well.The one problem I had was the connection between the ending and the post credits.

I still enjoy it very much when I re-watch it from time to time. Bride of Chucky was alright (too comedic for me) but Seed of Chucky was horrible.Just when I thought there couldn't be anymore horrible Chucky series, this movie comes along. When I read the news about the release of new Chucky, I was absolutely happy that I could see Chucky again on the big screen, but when I read that it is going straight to DVD I was skeptical of the quality of the film. My skepticism was correct, the movie is so horrible. It doesn't link up to the previous Chucky movies (just that he still has the stitched face from Bridge of Chucky) and the plot is completely re-written.The setting of the movie is too typical cliché much like the other gore movies that is released today (that usually goes straight to DVD). An old house hidden in the woods, disgusting gore scenes, random lesbian scene, etc etc. This is a mock to the setting of the original series itself. The addition of the lesbian scenes and the half naked girls in the film is clearly used to gain the attention of the male audience... that's it.The make up of the doll is sooooo horrible. Chucky looks like a demented female doll. It's face keeps changing from scene to scene to the extend where I question whether it is the same doll that is being used...This movie is horrible.

137,Rstein926,'Scariest' Childs Play film since the original,10,27 October 2015,"I have seen this film, the original Childs Play & Childs Play 2 & 3. I have not seen the other two Bride of Chucky & Seed of Chucky chiefly because they are more or less horror comedies something which Childs Play in my in opinion is not supposed to be. But the second film had it's moments of comedy such as Chucky burying another doll called 'Tommy' and his sarcasm in that film. Anyway this film is arguably the second best Child's Play film after the original. Simple reason is because Chucky is back to his murderous ways and the film's setting in an eerie and grim looking Goth like house sets the tone for the film followed by the music.Set 25 years after the original film Chucky is delivered to a young woman named Nica who is paraplegic. Her mother Sarah is killed by Chucky off-scene and is the first of a list of victims to be killed off in the film. Later in the film Nica's relatives, Father Frank & the nanny Jill visit and Nica's niece finds Chucky and decides to keep him. During the film Father Frank, Jill, Nica's sister Barbie and Nica's brother in law Ian are killed off one by one. Chucky attempts to kill Nica too but explains he is doing this for revenge after Sarah 25 years ago alerted the police when he killed her late husband Daniel and after kidnapping her stabs her while she is pregnant causing Nica to be disabled. Chucky then manages to get Nica framed and she is sent to prison for 'her crimes'. Finally Chucky is reunited with both his old girlfriend Tiffany and his ex-owner Andy Barclay. The latter then shoots Chucky but whenever he got killed or not is open to debate.Why the film was direct-DVD/Blu-ray is beyond me but it was still a great film overall. I also think this film was similar to the 1982 horror film 'Poltergeist' especially Alice as like Carol-Anne she was an innocent and gullible young girl who made 'friends' with the film's main villain who want the girls in both films respectively. I think the girl who played Alice should have been in the 2015 remake of 'Poltergiest'.All in all the film was very scary and Brad Dourif again did another great job as Chucky.",Curse of Chucky

141,guddu-1387,One of the best slasher film of 2013,8,18 December 2013,"This movie had 100 million dollar plus box office potential , i wonder why universal didn't merit this film for theatrical release. The movie is not just any other revenge slasher ,what we see normally with each direct to video release. It's a story blended with as much horror and emotions for the fans. There are flaws but these are just minor nerve chuckles , for e.g why does the character has vested interest in selling the house or the au pair (nanny) is so sweet and hot . The plot centers around one night stand of the family which is followed by Chucky who recently came by mail, invoking carnage on each one of them. To add twist to the film we see a wild relationship between the family members, and it doesn't stops there, towards the end we see the climax getting philosophical and hard to digest and this is solved in the post credit. Until now i had only seen post credit used for signaling possible sequels. There is also a flashback sequence where it is established why Chucky is rampaging the family. Of course the gem of this film is ""Fiona Dourif"" as Nica with her excellent performance of a paraplegic girl, exhibiting both vulnerability and physicality . The supporting cast does a commendable job and i must say ""Brennan Elliott"" and ""Maitland McConnell"" were perfect cast for Barb and Jill . The gory scenes are quite disturbing but thanks to the director ""Don Mancini"" ,he doesn't makes it a mess .He has definitely made a horror worth watching , i strong recommend this film for horror fans .

144,DreamOWD,This redeemed the series,9,1 September 2016,"Mancini has shown us he's still got it! This movie has the right balance of just about everything you could want in a Chucky film, it's why I own it. And I don't even own any of the other films. Comparing this with Seed of Chucky is like day and night. While Seed of Chucky upset me because of its direction and focus on mainly Tiffany, the gross out black comedy and virtually no scares. I at least appreciated the look of the film, and the soundtrack. It was mostly a parody. But with Curse of Chucky, all is forgiven.Sales were up, reviews were up. Promotions were up. It has the thrill factor again. The Chucky franchise is back on track.Curse of Chucky is almost as good as the first entries but it's not perfect. I'm going to give this movie a ding on the animatronics. The puppetry in this film just isn't on par with the earlier films. This has been the case starting with Seed of Chucky, when they switched the companies that did the puppetry. Chucky is scarier when he isn't moving in this film. The puppetry is very rigid, stilted, robotic, not in a good way. There were some bad shots revealing the limitations of the puppet, which takes you out of it. Imagine a little girl playing make-believe with her Barbie toy and how when the girl is making Barbie talk, she'll bob the doll up and down. That's how the puppetry is at times in this film. Especially in the last two entries. When Chucky talks, the body shakes like a machine or a robot—letting you know it's an animatronic. It's really evident in Seed of Chucky, but less evident in this film. I really hope they can improve that in the coming films so as to make the character more believable like in the first entries. Because that's one of the scariest things about Chucky, is when it comes alive.I love Chucky's redesigned look that's excellent. They tried to be innovative too by a few new techniques in certain scenes. Allowing Chucky to do things he hasn't been seen doing before. There could've even been a little bit of CGI, but no one can be sure because it's very, very succinct. I don't even know if it's CGI or not.The only other problem I had with this film is the ending. It nearly drops the ball. Because it doesn't make much sense what is happening in the numerous ending scenes. I believe this may have been done purposely to please audiences and to let them draw their own conclusions. So; altogether this is a very enjoyable film worth my money.

145,williamel1986,And when you though it couldn't get worse,3,30 September 2013,"First of let me start by saying i was really looking forward to this movie.... The promise of going back the the original formula of the Child's Play movies got me pretty excited..... Man was i disappointed. There is but two positives i can take from this movie. The first is the performance by Fiona Dourif as Nica, who all in all delivery a performance that was somewhat believable in a totally unconvincing movie. The second is that this movie was SO bad it may have put the franchise to bed for good. The directing and cinematography was atrocious... at the early stages of the movie we have a orchestral build whilst the camera slowly zooms in on the house for 10 seconds then there is a scream and we are taken to shot of Nica in bed. It is almost as if Mancini (director) had read a book on horror clichés and tried to pack as many into this movie as he could.The movies ""plot"" was full of holes and seem to be built more on the deaths scenes than a story line. For example the priest, I am still wondering why the hell he was in the movie apart from one more body on the death count. Yes Nica does make a comment they gives the impression that her and her mother were religious and may have turned there back on the church but that is it, no more mention of the church or the Priest after he is killed.The effects on this Movie were horrible.... and not in the good horror way, In the way that left me wondering if the SyFy had bought out the franchise. When Chucky finally talked it his true voice (45mins in) the doll looked nothing like it had in previous scene but looked quite similar to Chloe Moretz in clips i've seen from Carrie.Last off i though i would mention that i was seriously struggling to keep my attention focused on this movie it was that bad.To conclude, i would not recommend that you watch this movie....

""Chucky doesn't believe in God,"" she says. ""He says life's a bitch, and then you die like a stuck pig."" I got a laugh there, and maybe a few other times.

That was my first Child's Play movie. Now going into the movie. C.O.C. is a straight to DVD movie that didn't make it to theaters due to the reception of Seed of Chucky. But does this mean that its not a movie worth watching? No. This movie is a great horror and Child's Play movie. Chucky is treated with dignity and functions as both a (semi) comedic and scary killer. Opposite to the Nightmare on Elm Street remake where they relied more on jump scares, C.O.C. realizes more on suspense which gets you to the edge of your seat constantly. And I know I'll probably get criticized for not saying this: yes, Brad Dourif's (voice of Chucky) daughter (Fiona Dourif) plays the main character in this movie. Now for the bad... The stage 2 Chucky doll of course looks weird (the doll in the trailer that everyone had questionable about), and its also your indicator that Chucky is about to do something. Another gripe of the film is the continuity connection. *** SPOILERS: Jennifer Tilly is back, but as Tiff not as herself; this questionable because Chucky lists the families he's messed with and he says ""... the Tillys."" And Chucky isn't killed by his head being knocked off, but functions like if you knock a regular doll's head off. *** So on conclusion, C.O.C. is a good horror film and Chucky film but needs work on its continuity. P.S.: Buy the Blu-Ray, you'll see an old familiar face that you haven't see in years.",Curse of Chucky
148,croat-hr,Awesome horror,8,13 September 2019,"I like this one better than the original, actually. And I know I'm in a vast minority here.
I like this sequel so much, that I even like it's sequel ""Cult of Chucky"", which goes into camp and B grade comedy again, but since it's a direct sequel of this one, including its main character Nica, I like that one too.
""Curse"" is my favourity Chucky movie, ""Cult"" is on the fourth place (behind first twoo and Curse, but before all others, including 3).So my ratings go like this1 Curse of Chucky

150,griffjohnjr,A Return to form,10,23 May 2020,Curse of Chucky is a great entry in the franchise. It is a definite improvement over Seed of Chucky which simply plays for laughs. Chucky returns to horror and Don Mancini does a great job setting up the gloomy atmosphere of this film. The film ties well with the rest of the franchise and only seems to ignore Seed. I wasn't sure what to expect when this film was announced but was pleasantly surprised. An instant classic in my opinion.,Curse of Chucky

152,LennonBlake,An excellent surprise for the fans of the killer doll himself,10,20 October 2013,"If you are a fan of this series then you are sure to be charmed to the bone by this installment. Despite a slight departure in Child's Play 3, this one picks up the ball. Or knife rather. Having David Kirschner and Don Mancini on board is a winning formula as displayed in Curse of Chucky. I have only just finished watching the film and felt the need to post a review of my approval. The mood of the movie blends both Child's Play 1 and 2 and therefore sets a wide open stage for Chucky. I can't divulge too much lest I spoil any bit of the movie but suffice to say that all the ""surprises"" are utterly and completely awesome. Curse of Chucky made me smile at the methods of Chucky and his thinking. It's what's made this character so charming and entertaining however violent and evil he may get. Curse of Chucky, as most previous Child's Play films, finds what can only be described as a very difficult balance between a lovable character and a psychopathic murderer. Big fan of the cast, the animation is solid, not to mention that the story was solid. An outsider probably wouldn't understand but for all the other Chucky fans out there, dig into this one as it is a fitting installment into the Child's Play franchise.10/10, absolutely loved it!!",Curse of Chucky
153,cajete,No more comedy. Back to Chucky's roots.,6,24 September 2013,"I don't write many movie reviews on here. That being said, this is one of those movies I just had to share my thoughts on. Firstly, everyone who is saying this is the worse of the series is completely mental. The last two Chucky movies were atrocious. They took the essence of the originals and convoluted them into some sort of dark comedy. In my opinion, that's not what Chucky's about. Chucky's about a sinister doll that possess the soul of a serial killer. It works as a horror movie more than it does a comedy. Curse of Chucky accomplished what the last three movies didn't. It stayed true to what Chucky is. It respected the fundamentals of the first two movies. Yeah, of course you'll have your cliché moments, and some those cornish one liners, but hell, what horror movie nowadays DOESN'T have them. The writing, the acting, it was decent. It wasn't SPECTACULAR, or AMAZING, but it was EFFECTIVE and good enough for what it is and for what it's worth. I give this a 7/10, and recommend giving it a chance.",Curse of Chucky
154,dhstorch123,As Good As The First,8,28 September 2013,"Being a straight to DVD release combined with the ridiculousness of Bride and Seed of Chucky, I did not expect much from this movie. Sure enough it started off a little slow, as the film takes the time to build a story and introduce characters. When the action starts, you'll be on the edge of your seat and in awe when the film ties itself back to the Original Chucky movie. This movie brings the Child's Play series back to it's roots and redeems itself as a serious slasher-horror franchise. The ending leaves you knowing that this is not the last Child's Play movie we'll see, but wondering if it's the last time we'll see the red-headed killer doll. This is arguably the best Child's Play movie to date. There are a few inconsistencies, for example why Chucky didn't bleed when stabbed, but they are easy to overlook.",Curse of Chucky

156,d-wyatt25,"It does a job, but it won't blow you away.",5,5 January 2014,"It you're a fan of the Chucky franchise you would be forgiven for overrating this title based on the last two laughable films you were treated to, but against it's modern day horror partners it is relatively poor. With cold, stiff dialogue and one dimensional characters that are neither likable or convincing. I really wanted to like this film as a Gothic throwback to a little bit of 80's revival. However for me it was all too predictable, the scares were very rare and very cheap. The murders were grotesque without needing to be, it lacked atmosphere and the only decent narrative was right at the end with the flashback sequence for the origins of the story and the Chucky doll. It was a good attempt to bring it back and to a point it did that. Like I said it did it's job, it gave you a scare or two, it made you cringe at moments and seeing a doll acting on its own will always be a little creepy, but anything more than that and you'll be left disappointed with the overall product. It's 90 minutes of light entertainment but don't expect to see a masterclass in the horror genre.",Curse of Chucky
157,johndough07,Very Well Done!!!,8,9 October 2013,"Let me start off by saying that I have been a fan of these films since I can remember. Seed of Chucky started to lose the spark when the comedy started to take the wheel, but this film went back to the roots. It takes Chucky and makes him something to fear again, which holds its own comedy in itself, considering it's a killer doll. But overall this film brings back the true character from the original film and capitalizes on his true nature of a psychopathic killer, while paying homage to the originals and giving fans a feeling of nostalgia ((which after 15 years since we have gotten a true Chucky movie) Bride of Chucky will just have to qualify). Fans should love this entry and even newbies can enjoy it. Definitely Recommended!!!!!!",Curse of Chucky

Watch after the credits and your see what i mean. It was cool but still. Moving on.....i don't want to give away the movie but if you are a fan of horror movies of the 80's then this is for you. If you are a HUGE fan of horror movies of the 80's (Jason, Freddy, Michael, Chucky, the list goes on) like i am then this is not just for you, its a must see. Everything comes full circle with this one and revitalizes the child's play genre. My hats off to you guys behind the franchise. Can't wait for the next one to come out.

That being said, I have to admit I didn't think much going into this film (it did go straight to DVD); a good part of me watched it just because of it's predecessors. I was so pleasantly surprised. This wasn't just another bloody sequel with little to no plot. The story line (to me anyway) was well thought out and fit in nicely with the entire Chucky concept. The acting was great. And of course- I love Brad Dourif and I'm so grateful he continues to portray his signature role instead of allowing Hollywood to distort and re-do everything into garbage.I also must say that the ending was far from predictable.

161,m-haan11,Worst movie of the franchise,1,3 October 2013,"This latest installment in the series is the worst of them all. Basically this is a movie that is just unnecessary. The story is pretty bad, boring and lame. Also the pace is very slow, making for a unpleasant viewing experience. Chucky behaves downright idiotic and gone are the moments of humor. The kills are not very original and CGI is obvious. We even see Chucky running and walking, all thanks to the help of some bad CGI. The plot is full of holes. Chucky has his sights set on a little girl, but at some point in the movie she just disappears. He has her hidden somewhere we are left to wonder, but hey there she is at the end all of a sudden, but in a totally different location. Chucky takes over her body, but a scene after the credits shows him, in his doll body, trying to kill Andy. So I guess he didn't take over her body.....I'm confused. I wish I didn't watch this movie, one and a half hours of my life I can't get back. Avoid this and watch one of the older movies.",Curse of Chucky
162,headbanger_leet,WHO in the right mind would produce this film....,1,2 November 2014,Chucky is an iconic figure in the horror genre it's as if someone just wanted money and had never seen a chucky movie made this. I agree the film before this was not all that great either to be honest childs play is the best and my personal favorite is the Bride of Chucky because you really got to see chuckys side way more. That's one reason this movie I believe failed is because of the fact the doll looks terrible only time it looks good is when its talking the old first film had a better doll than this movie. Chucky didn't really get much screen time at least as a talking psychopathic doll. This film was below a 1 to me I felt for its time it should have been 100x better.,Curse of Chucky
163,Robborg2003,Don Mancini needs to stop changing MAJOR plot lines.,6,24 September 2013,"I am a huge fan of Chucky, ever since the first film. I have loved all the sequels (except maybe part 3) and the inclusion of Jennifer Tilly in Part 4 and 5 was true genius.After watching ""Curse"" last night, which was, don't get me wrong, very enjoyable, I have to say Don Mancini needs to stop changing major plot lines. Cant he remember his own scripts? Does he really think the fans are idiots?? A major plot line of Part 5 was that Chucky was ""Made in Japan"", even though in part 2 we visited the doll factory - clearly set in Chicago.Part 6 has even worse plot holes. If this film is set between part 3 and 4, which we are lead to believe, Chucky should still be ripped up from the blades at the end of part 3. In Curse of Chucky, he already has his scars that Tiffany sews into his face. Much Later in the film, the beginning of Part 4 happens. So Chucky has his scars before he is given to Tiffany... Huh?? The continuity is just an absolute mess.Am I the only one to know the scripts well enough to know the order of events? There are some great moments, but really, Don Mancini should know the Chucky anthology better than anyone - but he dosn't.Another really annoying thing about ""Curse"" is Chucky's look. When he is a doll, he looks almost feminine, his hair is ridiculously long and his mouth just seems wrong. Then when he comes alive, his hair is actually shorter and he has a completely different look. I blame Tony Gardner for this. Even though he did the effects for ""Seed"", ""Curse"" has a completely different look to the doll.No where near as creative as Bride or Seed, this film promised to take Chucky back to his darker roots, however but the last quarter its just a comedy again.The best part is easily the Jennifer Tilly cameo, its a shame it was just so short.",Curse of Chucky
164,caitlynkeefer,"""I'll be back. I ALWAYS come back!""",10,7 October 2013,"Well, just like Chucky said . . . He ALWAYS comes back! And this time, he's back and better than ever! Although I've only been a fan of the ""Child's Play"" franchise for a short amount of time (since Seed came out) I still consider myself a hardcore fan. I love all of the movies equally, yes, even Seed. But after 9 long years without our favorite killer doll, I had almost given up hope that there would ever be another movie. But, low and behold, I just so happened to stumble upon a Chucky fan page on Facebook last year, that reported the news I've been longing to hear: A new Chucky movie would be coming out in 2013. Well, here I am, a week after its released date, and I really just have to say, this movie is . . . AWESOME!! No, really! Even after the cheesiness Seed of Chucky left behind, Curse goes back to its horror roots, just as Mancini promised us. The cast was amazing, especially Fiona Dourif, who plays the wheelchair bound Nica. Nica, to me, is such a great heroine character, and I'm not just saying that because I relate to her on a more personal level than most (I'm in a wheelchair too) but because she's actually a character you want to root for, and a character you feel sorry towards the end. But of course, and I've said this before in another Chucky movie review, Brad Dourif steals the spotlight as none other than Chucky himself. This movie has a lot of great twist and turns, which I don't wanna reveal to you for the sake of ruining it. You'll just have to watch it for yourself. But trust me, if you're a Chucky fan like I am, you are bound to love it! (Just be sure to stay tuned after the credits, for a special surprise scene!) The only thing that bugs me is that, why are some people giving this movie so much hate? Yes, I understand this movie has a few plot holes here and there, but what movie doesn't? And for those of you who call this movie drawn out and 'boring', I highly suggest you go watch the first ""Child's Play"" again! Anyways, like I said, if you're a fan like I am, young or old, you will defiantly enjoy this film! I bet Universal is kicking themselves in the ass for not putting this movie in theaters. And Don Mancini, if you're reading this . . . We want more Chucky!!!! Overall, I give this movie a 10/10! Chucky's back bitches!",Curse of Chucky
165,cpking7,Up With My Favorite Chuckys,9,28 September 2013,"Just got a chance to see this, and on the one hand, I'd read a few negative user reviews, but then I'd also seen very positive media reviews and that it had won a bunch of awards on the horror festival circuit, so I was curious where I'd come down. Just so you Chucky fans can know my taste, I really liked the original, but I LOVED both Bride of Chucky and Seed of Chucky. Bride added a lot more whimsy and comedy to the franchise, along with great visual style. I think Seed surprised a lot of fans because it mostly left horror behind: it's a campy, shockingly obscene, hilarious comedy, really one of the funniest movies of the last decade. The Bowie-like Glen/Glenda is a completely inspired character, part Oliver Twist, part Charles Manson. Jennifer Tilly is amazing. Love it. So I wasn't sure I'd really be into what was billed as a return to pure horror tone of the original. What I found was a much more stylish and intelligent movie than Child's Play 1. The set-up is fairly conventional, but the plot twists and character choices were inspired. For horror fans, the ""kills"" were really creative. The acting is mostly quite good, but the main character, Fiona Dourif, is fantastic. A lot less comedy in this than the two previous entries, but I think that was the intention, to return to the roots, and it worked for me: creepy, scary, and fun. Seed is still my favorite, but of the 'scary"" Chuckys, this one is the best. The only thing wrong with this movie is for some reason, it isn't being shown in theaters.",Curse of Chucky

167,devonsterling10,Curse of Chucky Review,4,19 October 2016,"For any horror fans, there are plenty of well known slasher villains we all know and love. Freddy Krueger, Jason Voorhees, Leatherface, Ghostface, Michael Myers, and everyone's favorite killer doll Chucky. I have been a fan of the Child's Play movies for years. I love the first one, I like Child's Play 2 and 3, I actually really enjoy Bride of Chucky, and Seed of Chucky? Uh...yeah. Now we have this film. I was excited that there was going to be another Child's Play movie and it was going to go back to the darker tone of the first one. But, the big question is: what do I think about it?First off all, the acting is very good. All the actors do a very good job in their roles. Brad Dourif as always shines in his role of Chucky and is great. The death scenes are awesome. Chucky as always comes up with great ways to kill his victims. There are a couple very good scenes in this movie. Including a flashback scene that shows how Chucky got into the position he was and it's very well done. I did also like how this went back to the darker tone of the first movie...but unfortunately the good stuff stops there. The rest? Not so good...My first problem with Curse of Chucky, are the characters. Now the Child's Play movies have had unlikable characters before. Like Detective Mike Norris from Child's Play, Phil from Child's Play 2, and John Ritter's character from Bride of Chucky. But in this film? All the characters except for The Main Character, Chucky, and the little girl. Are ALL unlikable. I hated the majority of the characters in this movie and I was happy to see them get killed by Chucky, and that is not good. It's not good. We should like the characters not hate them! Now that I brought up Chucky this brings me to my next problem.The Effects done on Chucky are horrendous. There are so many times where you can tell that Chucky is CGI and it's noticeable. Sometimes his mouth doesn't match up to what he's saying. Also, there are scenes where you can tell that a child or dwarf is playing him. Like when he's walking down stairs or when they do an overhead shot and from that overhead shot you can tell it's a dwarf or child. Speaking of the CGI there is a scene where the CG chucky is walking down stairs and not only is the CG very noticeable you hear Chucky laughing and his mouth isn't moving. I don't want to hear from people ""It's a low budget film back off"" that still doesn't give the excuse to give your audience poor and noticeably bad effects. My Next problem is the after credits scene. Now, I did like how it wrapped up the series and it gave us closure to Andy Barkley. I liked it. There are a lot of nice nods to the originals like seeing a graduation certificate from Kent Military Academy from Child's Play 3, we saw a picture of Kyle from Child's Play 2, and...we found out that Andy's mom married detective Mike Norris....she married the asshole that sent her to a mental hospital...I think the only reason they did that was to tie up the series and it did kinda work.Also, the movie isn't creepy or scary at all. There is some tension and some build up here and there but however: we have jump scares. Which I hate. Also, the ending is pretty anti climatic if you don't count the after credits scene. Our main character is sent off to a mental hospital and Chucky tracks down the little girl and plans on possessing her. She asks where Grandmother is and he says she's in the basement then Chucky begins to play hide the soul and JUMPSCARE the grandmother pops up...and that's it. Pretty anti-climatic.Overall guys, I had hope for this movie. I wanted it to be very dark and creepy just like the fist movie. While it was dark, it wasn't creepy. I was disappointed in this film. Very disappointed. While it is better than Seed of Chucky, it's still mediocre. As much as I thought the killers were good, the acting was good, Chucky was awesome, and there were a few good scenes scattered throughout. This is not a good entry in this series. It has unlikable characters, no scares, the after credits scene was kinda frustrating, and the effects on Chucky were God awful. I do respect that this movie has a fan base and I understand why people like it. I just personally don't like it and thought it was mediocre. If you're a fan of this series and you want something to wash the bad taste of Seed of Chucky out of your mouth than this movie's for you. Rating: 2/5=Mediocre",Curse of Chucky
168,xxitalianbabezxx,He's Back!!!! Better Then Ever,10,26 September 2013,The tag is just in case something is considered a spoiler in my review.When i was little Chucky use to scare me half to death. I remember my cousin had one of those My Buddy Dolls i would want to throw it out the window. Because i swore it looked like Chucky. But after i got older and my love for Horror movies increased so did my love for Chucky. Child's Play has been one of the best horror movies to come out of the 80s. The two movies that followed Child's Play 3 were Bride of Chucky and Seed of Chucky. Bride of Chucky was a decent movie it introduced us to Tiffany the love of Charles Lee Ray. Seed of Chucky that movie was just awful really i hated that movie so much.Many straight to DVDs seem to be rushed and turn out awful. But thankfully this did not. It was not rushed they took time. I just wish it would of been out in theater. Fiona Dourif who plays Nica is a great edition to the cast of Chucky movies. Now at first i was worried about how Chucky looked i thought it was awful. But when Nica's sister Barbra peeled away some plastic on his face to show he was back to how he was created in Bride of Chucky i was happy.Many people who are picky will say it doesn't have enough blood blah blah. Like i always say you don't need a lot of blood to have a good horror movie. You need a great story to it and Curse of Chucky has a good story. There is so man twists and turns you don't see coming. It also helps play into the beginning of Childs Play. The ending leaves more questions really hopefully it plays into another Chucky movie.There is a last scene after credits so don't miss it! It answers the question that everyone has been wondering since Child's Play 3 ended. Anyways all and all this movie was great i find myself watching it over and over. Hope to see more because you just can't keep a good guy down! So go watch it now! You won't regret it really! Just in time for Halloween!,Curse of Chucky

Not much more to add that what I said above, mainly because Charles Lee Ray has stopped fooling around and returned to his roots . In what was always a sociopath , a serial murderer , a madman cold and ruthless . The film serves as a sequel to the other five , and places us in the life of Nica , a young girl paralyzed girl , and her mother , which one afternoon I received by mail a box with the infamous doll inside. Oh , surprise, that night Nica 's mother dies in what appears to be a suicide attempt . What causes a curious family reunion, which reveals why Chucky went to that house and its real and brutal intent. Fiona 's performance Douriff ( Nica and yes, Brad 's daughter , the famous actor who provides the voice of Chucky ) is remarkable because at times plunges us into despair and anguish that his character lives in the situation that live. The rest are passable, since much not inquire either in what is said character depth , but definitely the star here is Chucky . The doll is now really Charles Lee Ray . Of the previous five sequels, even though this is the least time on screen has the doll in question, is the most brutal . Chucky causes a real butcher in 90 minutes and is , I believe for the first time since the original, taken as a serious and dangerous antagonist more measuring fifty centimeters. It's nice to see that Mancini made ​​this film with the simple intention to give it to the fans, to those who saw the other five and took him affection that one takes for a character like Chuck in 25 years , here definitely closes a bow , Chucky 's story is told , and not much more to add to what is said in the 95 -minute film ( Wait till you see the scene after the credits and you'll see what I mean ) . One detail deserves , and to close this review , the ambiance of the venue of the conflict. It is good idea to have chosen a stormy night, in a huge house and sinister aspect , because the film strives to provoke tension and the occasional scare , and at some point it gets . Without further ado , is the worthy sequel , after 25 years of comings , goings and missteps , the most famous doll murderer film history",Curse of Chucky

How wrong I was! I can only guess that Don Mancini is pretty bored with the Chucky character by now - understandable after so many years, but then just move on and don't bother boring audiences with uninspired drivel like this!While the first three Chucky movies featured great scripts, directing and acting, this time it is just on par with generic soap opera. While the first movies did a great job bringing the doll to live, here Chucky looks like a retarded plastic girly doll. While the voice acting and dialog of Chucky was superbly scary and funny in the first movies, I would not be surprised if Brad Dourif recorded everything in less than an hour this time (according to the trivia he spent ""less than a day"").

Chucky is now back with the same psychopathic thrill and without those repugnant elements from previous parts (bride and seed of chucky)! The movie tried to pursue the class of chucky as it had in first 3 parts, i.e a homicidal doll in a house slaughtering bunch of people! The acting in movie was just OK or below average! And some elements in movies were dubious (eg. when chucky got hurt there was no BLEEDING!) To sum up, it was a really well try to bring the form back of chucky!",Curse of Chucky
173,michellovesimone,The worst CHucky ever!,3,7 July 2014,"I always loved all these movies but this one stinks. The acting is not bad but the stuns are just terrible, very amateurish! Any time someone dies the movie skips. It's not gory and the only part that is sexy shows very little. Very predictable and the plot is terrible. Chucky seems to go back many years he's so terrible! Seems the director wanted to rewrite the whole Chucky story. For die hard fans this movie is a flop - DO NOT WATCH or you may never love Chucky again! SPOILER ALERT The stories tries to go back in history and do a full circle - sooo stupid! It finishes that the main actress is sent to a mentally insane hospital but what happens to the little girl??

The movie characters are also seriously stupid and they go accordingly such that it lets the doll win. In addition to the gore and the kissing scenes, I'd say that this film was done pretty badly considering I actually predicted the course of the film and the ending. The only thing that probably got me going ""UGH! Holy crap that scared me lol"" were probably just the jump scares. Would NOT suggest anyone watching this with a kid<12 years because the gore and violence and the stupid ass jumpscares would probably still give them nightmares. Other than that, it's good for a netflix film. Just try not to fall asleep amidst the film, like i almost did.",Curse of Chucky

176,RadioactiveZombieWerewolf,Chucky's Brilliant return with actual reasons why.,8,13 October 2013,"<< Contains Spoilers >>CURSE OF CHUCKY (2013) If you read my last review on SEED OF CHUCKY you know I pretty much hated that thing. BRIDE OF CHUCKY was not much better. CURSE OF CHUCKY (which you can actually REDBOX right now) however has just come out and it's freaking sensational. Everything about this movie brings back the actual horror feeling we had in the first 2 or 3 installments (apparently I wasn't the only one feeling they had mailed it in on this series). In this one Chucky has been mailed from the ""Evidence Department"" (the Tilly's house from SEED OF CHUCKY) to a new house that is creepy as hell. It doesn't take long before Chucky is back to his old tricks to a much darker and creeper tone than we have really ever seen him. Instead of a well known cast almost everyone in this aside from Jennifer Tilly, (the original Chucky voice and actual Charles Lee Ray and the original Andy) are mostly unknowns. Lead actress Fiona Dourif (actual real life daughter of Brad Dourif the dude who voices Chucky) does an incredible job along with the rest of the cast. I can't say enough about how I enjoyed this series finally getting back to its roots. One of the huge challenges with this film was that it had to find a way to get back to the horror levels of the originals but still tie in the entire series. Bring back the original Andy (wait for the credits to roll) and Jennifer Tilly was the icing on the cake that fans of both directions in previous films would love. Aside from Chucky going freakin berserk at the end of CHILDS PLAY 2, this newest installment (yeah and actual part VI, NOT A REBOOT), is the second best film in the entire series by hundreds of miles. Like nothing else in the series even comes close. If you find yourself asking how the cops showed up when no one had a phone or anything like that. There is a deleted scene called ""burn"" that covers this, but for some odd reason it was left out of both cuts of the film. For the superb casting, darker telling of the story, background provided and just sheer thought that went into this I have to give CURSE OF CHUCKY a solid 6 out of 7. Rating Definition - AMAZINGLY GOOD. This movie is more than a pleasant surprise. You will buy it. You will cry when you think about how awesome it is. If it comes on TV you will suddenly zombify and not be able to turn the channel.",Curse of Chucky

And extremely un-scary.,2,11 October 2020,"Where do I even start?Being someone who has seen every Child's Play / Chucky movie out there, I'm disappointed- no, EXTREMELY disappointed!The movie is fairly boring, barely anything actually happens. The movie is VERY slow and takes quite a while to actually kick into anything. Skipping ahead, each murder that occurs either are really dumb and had plenty of time to MOVE or FIGHT back or, they were just really anti-climatic.Most movies usually have a point throughout it where the climax is. Throughout the WHOLE movie, not once was there anything climatic. I had the exact same facial look the whole movie.Another thought I had was WHY didn't Nika show the court the camera which Ian hid in Chucky's overalls?? That LITERALLY proved Nika's point and would show exactly what happened! Literally makes NO sense!FINAL THOUGHTS: Overall, I really found it quite boring and uninteresting. In the original movies, Chucky had many lines and had somewhat of a comedic tone throughout the original movies. Chucky barely said ANYTHING throughout the movie and had no personality whatsoever. VERY disappointed!~ Satan's Daughter.",Curse of Chucky

The introduction of the lead character Sarah was again rather unique and seemed to hold a very interesting story in herself, beautiful wheel chair bound woman looking for love. Where you would assume the story would some how involve this concept and build upon it falls short and nothing develops; OK, no loss, this is Chucky right, he is the star. Then again where Chucky had always brought me back for more with his sly and raunchy humour there was very little of this. Maybe a snicker once or twice but I wanted more.Without any spoilers overall there was one good death scene and a couple OK ones. I didn't get that ""wow"" factor I was expecting, perhaps I was expecting to much. Solid attempt but missing the true soul of Chucky in my opinion.",Curse of Chucky

Accepting the film for what it is will make the film more enjoyable then trying to pick flaws in it as it probably is possible. There where also nice links to the previous films which should keep fans of the franchise happy. Overall the film was well executed in production and the acting was solid throughout in comparison to other budget horror films like the Night of the Demons remake, that is a film to watch for bad acting. Fiona Dourif who plays Nica and Brennan Elliott who plays Ian both deliver arguably the best acting performances in the film and makes me want to see them both get more roles in the future. The film itself left me feeling if another Chucky film was made I wouldn't be disappointed.",Curse of Chucky

He's going through the process to transfer to the little girl's body, but a bit into the credits they show him arrive at the place where Andy (from a previous Chucky movie) lives and he is still as the Chucky doll with the same scars from the main ending, not as the human girl they were previously showing him voodooing himself to transfer to the body of. Did I miss something? Is he gonna still be the doll in the next movie, or is he supposed to be in this girls body?

183,DetectJohnKimble,The 2nd Best of the Child's Play Films,7,10 October 2013,"Since direct to video movies became a viable market somewhere in '80s, the term has been associated with movies not good enough to make it to cinemas or cheesy cash-ins on existing franchises. Curse of Chucky, however, is a rare breed. It isn't just ""good for something that went straight-to-video"". It's a cut above all previous Child Play sequels and the horror remakes and reboots of today. Don Mancini didn't phone this in just because he wasn't getting on the big screen. It seems like he made this movie for the purpose of showing Universal Studios that a two foot tall, psychotic, killer doll can still be terrifying in 2013. In my eyes, he's succeeded.Returning to the darker roots of Child's Play & Child's Play 2, while obviously a key player, Chucky isn't the only frightening part of this film. Joseph LoDuca scores the film, and to put it mildly, the music is unsettling and adds tremendously to the overall creepiness. The sets may not look like much at first, but it becomes all the more menacing as events unfold. Also, Nica's circumstances are what really keep you on the edge of your seat. Unable to just run away at a whim, Nica is basically subject to Chucky's torture. It's very intense. Curse of Chucky shows us how horror franchises should continue. Not with a remake or a reboot - but a damn fine sequel. Even if you've never seen a Chucky movie in your life, you can pick up Curse of Chucky and immediately know what's going on. Everything is explained in due time. Hopefully, Chucky 7 will get the theatrical release this film deserved - and I hope it's just as good.",Curse of Chucky
184,ctsang-664-141163,Truly Bad,1,5 October 2013,"Curse of Chucky is a movie which makes me angry due to the illogical ways the movie plays out. Okay, I played along with the idea of a murderous doll. Even got a little scared at the start of the movie before the killing started. Then when it did as I mentioned at the start I actually got angry.Anger due to real world physics being ignored, maybe more of a fault with the directing than the writing. As a result it made the sequence of events seem very unbelievable to me.Anger is a stronger emotion than fear and once you feel anger especially for a horror movie your immersion into that movie ends. It actually got to the stage while watching the movie I was rooting for Chucky to dispatch the characters. Then I thought that was rather cruel as it was not really their fault and instead hoped that Chucky would kill the Director / Writer.You know a movie is bad when during the movie you can switch out and make up your own story and ignore what is happening on the screen.",Curse of Chucky

I think they're alright films the first couple were actually pretty good. Curse of chucky I thought was surprisingly good I think it is definitely better than the last two. I think going back to the dark tone helped the movie a lot. The acting was pretty decent it didn't bother me at all. The effects on the doll were a bit bad at times but it didn't detract from the movie that much. Brad Dourif does an excellent job as chucky. The kills were really good and creative. The movie starts kind of slow but it picks up pretty nicely the last half was extremely well done the way they made it connect back to the first movie and the cameos were nice to see also. I thought the main character being handicapped helped the movie because its something different and it makes chucky an even bigger threat. Some of the one liners from chucky were a bit cheesy but come on its a chucky movie. I almost gave this movie a six but decided that it deserved a seven. This movie was actually a bit creepy at times and there are quite a few good jump scares. overall I thought it was a pretty good addition to the chucky series. make sure to stay until the end of the credits.",Curse of Chucky
186,creedfanjeremy,Curse of Chucky Delivers!,9,1 October 2013,"""Hi I'm Chucky and I'm your friend till the end."" Well I guess this is true since the first installment was released 25 years ago. I was a little nervous about this film especially after the devastating Seed of Chucky. I loved this film. Curse of Chucky brings the franchise back to its horror roots. The best thing about these films was the moments we got with Chucky. When Chucky appeared on screen he stole the scene with his one liners and his ""killer"" personally. When Bride of Chucky came out the creator decided to give us a whole film full of these moments. While I enjoyed Bride, it was slightly over the top. With Seed of Chucky the franchise died for me. Seed was too cheesy and way over the top. Curse of Chucky redeems all of Chucky's qualities and brings him back from the dead better than ever. For most of the film it plays out like the first film, which I loved. Toward the end the film switches gears slightly more toward the ""of Chucky"" films, but not to much it loses its appeal. Whether your a old school Chucky fan or a fan of the ""of Chucky"" films, there's something for everyone. There's twists and surprises that will please any Chucky fan. I'm sad this film did'nt go to theaters because it's that GOOD. If you've been a fan of Chucky in the past I highly recommend this film. "" Hi I'm Chucky, wanna play?"" Yes Chucky. This time we do.",Curse of Chucky
187,jdhill2263,"A slightly surprisingly successful ""Chucky"" sequel!!",10,8 October 2013,"When I first saw the trailer for this movie, part of me was excited to see that Chucky was being revived again. The other part of me was extremely skeptical of it. I thought, at first, that this was an attempt at a ""remake"" of the original, which is not the case. So, don't be fooled by the fact that, in the trailer, the infamous ""Good Guy Doll"" is brand new and not all cut up and sewn back together as we last saw Chucky. You'll understand once you've seen the movie. Anyway, after realizing it was a sequel, not a remake, I was skeptical for new reasons. First and foremost, I was skeptical because of Seed of Chucky being such a failure. Both Bride and Seed of Chucky really took the series out of the horror genre and put it more into the comedy genre, as admitted by various crew members of those films and this new one. It's quite obvious that fans of this series hated Bride and Seed. As a huge fan of this series, I will admit that I didn't find Bride of Chucky to be all that horrible. Anyway, it was blatantly obvious that, if a new film was to be made, it would have to be taken back to its roots as a true horror movie. That's exactly what was done.This was a somewhat surprisingly great movie. It was truly taken back to its roots as a dark and twisted movie. This is, in my opinion, the first successful sequel since Child's Play 3. It finally brought back to life the ""creepy killer doll"" that scared me to death as a child. I really enjoyed it all the way through from beginning to end all the way up to the (Spoiler Alert) additional scene at the end of the credits. This film also, as an added bonus, (Another slight Spoiler Alert) gives additional back story information on Charles Lee Ray and has cameos by characters from previous films. All in all, this is a great sequel and it's well worth a watch. If you're a true horror movie fan and a true fan of the Child's Play or ""Chucky"" series, you will like this movie. Although I feel that this movie would've done really well in theaters, I, unlike some, completely understand and agree with the decision to bypass theaters and have the film go straight to DVD.",Curse of Chucky
188,bdcotton,"Sorry, Jack...Chucky's back...",7,18 November 2013,"After the worst entry in the series, Seed of Chucky, came out nine years ago, I thought that one of my favorite horror series had finally hit bottom. This sixth installment, Curse of Chucky is a great improvement over SEED. Chucky is back to his nasty, evil self as he was in the first 3 movies, without all the over-the-top satire and black comedy that ruined the last movie. I was also impressed with the quality of the movie as it was a direct-to-video release. I think this movie sets a new standard for quality in the home video market. Although, the ending with the now adult Andy Barclay could potentially lead to a great seventh film where characters from the first movie return. It would be awesome to see those characters come back. I also love the twists/flashbacks that reveal Charles Lee Ray before he transfered his evil soul into the Good Guy Doll, and his connection to the main characters. Tiffany's appearance at the end was no surprise but still welcomed. It is satisfying that creator, Don Mancini kept in continuity with the other films (whether good or bad), while starting fresh with a new story. There is still a little life left in this franchise. I see potential for a couple more movies. I recommend this film to all my fellow movie-geeks out there. It's a solid effort to bring back the scary Chucky and move the franchise forward. 7 out of 10.",Curse of Chucky
189,kirkwoodacekzx,Curse of Chucky....Meph....,5,18 November 2013,"Now let me start off by saying...Curse of Chucky was an OKAY movie a bit of plot holes and this definitely could be renewed for another movie. The ending of the film may be upsetting to those who wanted the Chucky movie to be ORIGINAL as it could be. And I was kinda upset about that also at first. But the fact that we know more about the man behind Chucky (Charles Lee Ray) makes the story a lot more interesting then what we expected. The Fate of the main character is REALLY upsetting and the scares were cheap scares and ""Chucky"" themed scares. Except then ending when the lady jumps at the camera. I recall everyone in the room screaming like someone had exploded into millions of pieces. Please believe me- if you are new to the Chucky series or even a Chucky fan it explains everything from the first Chucky film. The after the credits scene is pretty interesting as Andy Barclay returns to finish off Chucky. So there's a reason why a Sequel could NOT happen. Makes Sense Right?

I kind of wish I'd waited until night since this movie actually had some real tension to it. The Rat Poison Roulette scene was kind of fun to watch. It could have been anyone and guessing who got the bad bowl was sadistically entertaining.There were some slightly cheesy moments and some of the acting left a lot to be desired but that's just part of the franchise from the beginning.

But needs another sequel!,9,25 September 2013,"So at this point a lot of fans have seen The Curse of Chucky and I can say that is a better film that the last two (I like ""Bride"" but I really hate the ""Scream"" approach). ""Curse"" is near to be the real sequel of the 1988 classic because they share a lot of elements that have been lost in CP2, CP3 and well... we didn't talk of ""Bride"" and ""Seed"", they follow a very different row.The inclusion of Charles Lee Ray in flashbacks are really good, but it didn't help us to follow the line to the begin of Child's Play... a sequel maybe can do this. The story of Nica Pierce can continue and at one point I imagine that she track Andy Barclay to tell him that Chucky is still alive, that thing could explain that he was ready to face Chucky.Hopefully a sequel would be near and have Andy, Karen Barclay, Mike Norris, Kyle and Nica Pierce as the ones that are determined to destroy Chucky and Tiffany once for all....

They ruined the whole sense of Chucky and how he's alive person inside of a doll. A huge screw up by the so-called director was that yes his face was mangled with cuts of real flesh but when his head was chopped off there was no blood there was no guts he did not die and yet in the last movie he was chopped to pieces by his son arms legs and head and he died. Also the matter of which nobody was capable of attempting to fight Chucky was horrible.

It shied away from the slapstick goofiness of the last two Chucky titles. It doesn't take itself too seriously either though. There are a few good laughs but nothing that takes away from the horror aspect of the film. I rated it a 10/10 because I think a 5.9 rating is a little low and I'd like to see this film get the recognition it deserves because I for one would love to see at least one more Chucky film like this one. It was refreshing and the best one since the first two. If I have anything to complain over it might have been to have Chucky speak a little more speaking parts in it. But I still really enjoyed how they did it. Long live Chucky! Long live 80's horror flicks.,Curse of Chucky
196,patrichi_mihai,Decent enough to be entertaining,6,24 September 2013,"The Spoiler tag is there just for some details that in my opinion don't give away the plot nor damage a first time watch if you read this review. This movie is a straight to DVD/BR but don't let that fool you because thanks to the team behind it, it doesn't look cheap nor rushed, in fact the balanced usage of the money at hand is one of this movie's highlights (It relies heavily on practical effects and the little CGI used looks pretty good).Story-wise, it's a mixed bag as what initially proved to be the saving grace turns into the bag of stones that drag it to the bottom towards the end: the movie takes place after the initial trilogy and right before the awful Bride and Seed so it's enjoyable to try and guess how it ties to the first three movies (even if it's a long shot, it's still plausible) right until the end when (for the love of God i wonder why) they can't help themselves and link it to the rest of the sequels. Apart from this inconvenience it's still a decent sequel, closer to the original in mood, kills and overall atmosphere. Gore-hounds will be disappointed, even the Unrated version is mild in comparison to other titles (even compared to the sequels) but like i said, the movie is closer to ""Child's Play"" not to ""X of Chucky"". The movie looks good and there are a few instances of very smart usage of camera angles and lightning that put this one above the usual ""straight to DVD"" offerings. Unfortunately even if as a whole the movie stays away from over-used slasher film shenanigans there are a few inconsistencies that might pull you out of the movie making you wonder ""why the hell did you had to use that when you kept it anchored in reality so far?"" Acting-wise Fiona Dourif is great and has a very likable screen presence making her character believable all the way till the end and the few scenes Brad Dourif appears in are played in tune with the Charles Lee Ray we know from the original. The rest of the cast, while not bad, are just decently played cannon fodder bordering on stereotypical characters.As a conclusion, while the intention is applaudable, honestly i think it's a shame that they tried to satisfy both the older and the new fans. Fans of the original ""Child's Play"" trilogy will like this one right up until the end when they'll realize it actually links to the dreaded campy sequels and fans of the ""of Chucky"" sequels will find it dragging, boring, lacking gore, anticlimactic and i don't think the ending segment that ties it to the newer movies will be enough for them.Still, and enjoyable watch and a good effort considering how much it feels like the older movies.PS: there is a scene after the credits so make sure you don't miss it. The good part? it's well executed and it's hilarious. The bad part? it kind of negates the ending prior to the credits.",Curse of Chucky

Before their arrival, their mother received a package that contained a brand new Good Guy doll. Now, her five year old niece is playing with this doll, and more deaths are happening in the house. Could the doll be the resurrected Chucky?One of the things that Mancini did in writing this installment is bring back the scary Chucky. The setting of the old Gothic house plays a big part in what makes this work -- Chucky can be anywhere in the house, and you don't know where he's going to pop out from. (I actually jumped a few times) And what I like is that he also didn't ignore the continuity of the series -- without giving anything away, characters from previous movies come back (if you watch the unrated version, he even pays a visit to an ""old friend"" after the end credits), and they're also mentioned over the course of the film.There are a few story issues -- things that get explained that in reality would not make sense, for example.

It kept me on the edge of my seat (people with short attention spans won't appreciate this), it had me invested on new protagonist Nica, and most importantly redeemed the franchise after the misstep that was Seed of Chucky. To make it clear, this movie is a sequel to Seed not a reboot as rumored.My favorite scenes were those involving Nica (Brad Dourif's real life daughter). She was truly sympathetic and interesting to watch. Her interactions with Chucky were equally entertaining and at times unnerving. Her background with Chucky was woven in so well it made her seem like she had been part of this series all along.Nica's struggles with her sister Barbie and interactions with little niece Alice were a feast to behold; quite literally since there was tasty veggie chilly involved.For the misguided, proof this was a sequel to Seed: 1) Chucky is already stitched up, but spends the first 40 minutes with his face covered with a latex mask.2) Tiffany in Jennifer Tilly's body appears after the climax and is missing the tattoo over her right bosom, indicating this is not her original body.3) Tiffany kills a cop from the back of his car for snooping with the evidence bag containing the INTACT Chucky doll, then she giggles ""They never learn."" 4) Chucky mentions some of the families he has met over the past 25 years: the Barclays, the Kincaids, the Tillys.We also got some interesting and creepy flashbacks with Charles Lee Ray, although the stand-in for Brad Dourif looked nothing like him which made it distracting when they did use archive footage from the first film. These scenes may have compromised the continuity of the first film due to the absence of Eddie Caputo, which suggested Charles was running from a different crime.The continuity of Bride of Chucky may also be messed with, due to dialog in said movie suggesting Charles did something different from what was shown in these flashbacks prior to the police chase. For example: the diamond ring he stole from Vivian Vanpelt though this may have occurred at any time prior to holding Sarah hostage in the basement.Other peeves I had concerned the confusing ending (made that way by the after credits scene), the painfully bad acting from returning series veteran Jennifer Tilly, and the Chucky doll's design. The latter was most distracting; the transmogrification of the doll being poorly executed compared to the original Child's Play trilogy.With the use of CGI, I was expecting the moments the doll came alive to be more organic and not as fake looking. Don't get me started on those eye lids! However, I will give this a pass. Having worked in film productions before and given the budget for this film was $8,000,000 (less than the original Child's Play $9,000,000 budget), it's no wonder they had such problems! The design of the doll on the other hand created notable technical and continuity errors between shots. For example, the eyes had bloody veins one take and none the next, the doll had no eyebrows one take and suddenly bushy red hairs the next, the hairline receded one take then was back to a normal.Most noticeable, the gaping mouth had no tongue, no mouth hole, and just a pair of buck teeth one take but the next he had two rows filled with teeth, a tongue and hole; then back to how it was before (happens at least three times during the film).Besides these flaws, the story did as promised and re-captured the feel of an era long gone, while salvaging the franchise from being unwatchable and garnering excitement for future projects. It certainly made me jump couple of times!",Curse of Chucky
204,bphussar-773-53986,He is Back and is Coming for YOU!,10,24 August 2013,"Do NOT underestimate this movie. Just because it's going straight-to-DVD does not mean it will be ""another terrible sequel"". This movie contains twists, gore, and so much scare, you will most likely jump out of your seat more than once. AND not only will this movie have you begging for another, this movie will PROMISE you another. Chucky has been around since the 80's but now it's time for a revamp. And while some of the Chucky models especially in this movie might look a tad awkward, this doll will eventually evolve into one of the most horrifying icons that has startled people for decades. Chucky is back, better than ever, and one hell of a killer doll!",Curse of Chucky
205,mellow_guy00,Not really what I had expected...so far from it!,4,24 September 2013,"Okay. Just seen Curse of Chucky. Gruesome? Yes. Lot of murders? Yes. Jennifer Tilly? Yes. But NOT even remotely scary. I was doubly disappointed with this film. It did return to its horror roots but it just wasn't as scary like its predecessors (CP1-2). Just because it has to be direct-to-DVD, doesn't he has to lose his touch. I mean, you can clearly see the partial animation, which REALLY disappointed me a lot. It did explain what happened before the cops chased Charles Lee Ray down to that toy store (CP1) It didn't made sense that he was all in stitches again. Not really in sync with CP3 and Bride. But it did have some surprise ending ""6 months later"" Let's just say there's a lot of cameo appearances there. I say Child's Play 1 REBOOT.",Curse of Chucky
206,brettdonofrio,perfect,10,25 September 2013,"They did everything right this time. I am a long time fan of this series, child's play 3 was my favorite one before this. Seed of chucky was a disaster. Now you know where I am coming from here.To see someone finally make a sequel to something these days is refreshing. It's all remakes and reboots and garbage. They nailed the pacing and tone. The quick funny moments were spot on. To the people complaining about the story, it's a horror movie you dopes! It doesn't need a real story. The ""story"" is told through the characters interactions with chucky and it doesn't disappoint at all.The entire time I was watching it I enjoyed myself, it kept getting better and better. If you are the kind of person that intensely picks apart movies then this movie isn't for you in the first place. This was made to entertain fans of the series and to give chucky a fitting end, instead of the complete trash that was seed of chucky.If you liked the first 3 child's play movies, you will LOVE this! That's all there is to say about that.",Curse of Chucky
207,koensysmans,why did i even hope that this was gonna be a decent sequel?,2,26 September 2013,"no words are good enough to describe how bad this 6th part of the series is, if you thought seed of chucky was bad, don't come near this one... I hate these kind of modern horror movies where you can predict how the movie is going to go, all characters have a common IQ of 90, so every one of those dumb asses is gonna do what any rationally thinking human would not do... Also i miss the dark humor in this chapter, even in the first chapter there were signs of it, but here it's just awful...it could've been a much better movie if there was the same effort put in the script as in camera, lighting and special effects...sad to say this chapter only gets a 2 out of 10....",Curse of Chucky
208,sullengirl365,Chuuckkyy did it,6,27 September 2013,"I enjoyed the movie. I feel some type of way about the ending but I love how everything ties together. The movie starts with a box being delivered to the home of Nica and her mother. They don't know who the box is from but takes the box anyway. Then murders happen. The first death is the death of Nica and Barb(Nica sister) mother. Then Barb and her family comes to be by Nica side along with the local Prist and then he dies. Next the Nanny, Barbs lover and then Barb. Nica discovers that the doll is more than just a doll and the only people alive are Nice, Ian, Barb husband and Alice. Alice is locked in the closet and Ian is waken by Nica cry for help. Ian and Nica try to leave the house but Ian goes back to look for Alice. Ian then thinks that Nica killed Barb and the nanny. Ian ties Nica up to question her about the murders and then Chucky walks in and kills Ian. Nica and Chucky have the tea time and then we see Nica is being arrested for murder. Like all of Chucky films no one thinks the doll did it. There are surprise visits by Jennifer Tilly and a much older Andy. The only thing that the Curse of Chucky disappoints is the ending. I don't know if Chucky trade bodies with the little girl and tricked her into getting into the box to be delivered to Andy's home or if he never traded bodies with the little girl(Alice). All in all the Curse of Chucky gave me everything and I'm happy I saw it.",Curse of Chucky
209,conan-kudo81,Curse of Chucky was trying to fill up plot holes from the other films,8,27 September 2013,"Lets just say that the movie is not for people who truly wanted to see this movie fail by making excuses to why this movie was bad. the plot was OK and it had a nice flow to who was to die next. the movie gave a decent reason why the family was his target. the personalities of Nica's family gives us the need to see those people die, besides the little girl, they are all horrible people. the revealing of Chucky stitches was actually a sign of relief when i realized it wasn't a prequel or a start from scratch reboot. it patched a few plot holes (though not all of them) Jennifer Tilly's body was still had Tiffany soul in her so of course she was going to help him(their children didn't matter in the story so don't ask)and the story came full circle when it showed the events that led back to the first movie. And the end credits scene answers the Question of what happened to Andy at the end of CP3. Bitch all you want if you want to make illogical sense over a movie you didn't make. The creator did his best to bring HIS character back to the roots of being a horror film. finally for those who found this film not as scary as the first, remember, everything was terrifying 25 years ago.",Curse of Chucky

But always enjoying the films for what THEY WERE. I am here to tell all you chucky fans that THIS NEW MOVIE IS BRILLIANT!!! it ties up so many loose ends, uncovers more backstory, AND brings Chucky BACK to his Horror Roots. I watched the movie twice full through and thought a lot about the film. Its great..delivers on everything that made Childs Play a Cult Classic WIth a MASSIVE following!! and comes complete with some good old Scares and BIG surprises for the Faithful fan base.

But this.. really.. THIS movie is such a pain in the *** to watch if you watched previous Chucky - Child's Play movies before. It's the same awful thing they did with Nightmare on Elm Street - turn a masterpiece of horror into a ROFL-DE-bop movie. OMG! You really deserve a kick into a magic circle for this one. Stop wasting our time! Stop doing sequels that nobody likes!And because I have to fill this 10 lines of text I just wanted to suggest: Don't watch it if you're a fan or familiar with the previous Chucky movies.",Curse of Chucky
212,paperlyon,A fantastic return to the original formula.,10,20 October 2013,"Initially I believed I was sitting down to watch a Child's Play reboot. What I got however was a film showcasing just how talented Don Mancini truly is as a film maker. I'll keep this short and spoiler-free. This movie did something a lot of horror films with iconic villains fail to do after the first movie: establish a truly suspenseful atmosphere. If you've followed the Child's Play movies over the years you probably never experienced shock on the level that you did when he first started talking in the first film. However, that shock is easily captured again with great atmosphere, fantastic characters, and of course the bewildering vulgarity the title character traditionally employs through it all. Oh and the actual Chucky doll looks damn creepy. I'm not sure what it is, but he is a lot more unsettling without the scars, and the changing faces of the doll throughout the movie left me biting my fingernails.Is this movie perfect? Perhaps not in the sense that it's not some epic film on the level of The Lord of The Rings or something of the sort. But a film like this that truly surpasses the limitations set upon it by sequel after sequel is rare. Especially considering it was a straight-to-DVD release. So I'm gonna give credit where credit is due, as I haven't seen such a startlingly strong return to the original themes as this movie portrayed.",Curse of Chucky
213,malinji,the worst movie ever ! please delete it,1,21 October 2013,"the budget was $5.000.000 ..but should be $5 !!!! the worst movie of all time ! please...do not buy ! do not watch ! simply the worst ! Worst movie of all times! I was surprised to see this title again, but the lack of creativity in this film made the experience a little uncomfortable. I tried to hold on in the couch to finish it...Maybe some people can like it, but for me, as a horror fan, no way! The acting was poor, not so bad, but the script doesn't helped in any way. I don't know what was in the director's mind.I can't even describe it in ten lines! First thing, lacks originality, creativity, and the x-factor, surprise. The begin was sort of nice, but in the middle to the end, the quality just falls. The animations with Chucky are really bad and the story line is just a copy of a lot of other films...1 of 10.",Curse of Chucky
214,patrickcgrind,Chucky is finally dead...,4,22 October 2013,"Starts off real slow, with mediocre acting, and bad dialogue. There is no connection between the plot of ""Curse of Chucky"" and any of its prequels until the end, which is a pathetic attempt to incorporate the plot of the whole franchise in 15 minutes. If it weren't for some ridiculous, comedic deaths, i would give it the lowest rating possible. The film does that thing where there are constant suspense scenes with eerie music, and 90% of the time nothing happens. The lack of a plot causes anxiety and disappointment throughout. Also the effects are worse than ever, but what can you expect with lowest budget? Chucky hastily performs a possession on a little girl, at the end; which is really his only consistent mission throughout the movies. It is for this reason, and all of the others above, that I truly believe this movie was the end of the ""Childs Play"" franchise.",Curse of Chucky
215,orangecali92,Chucky reborn !,8,22 December 2013,"I'm really surprised that this movie is so underrated on IMDb. It's very well written and played, great, believable performance by all the characters and finally the series takes it on a more serious note and really brings back memories from the first two movies... On a negative note, i really disliked the cheesy scene with the priest's head at the car accident. As well, the story looked a bit rushed at certain times.Overall, a very good movie and well above my expectations ( considering the last movies from the series). Would strongly recommend it to all who liked the first 3 ones.8/10",Curse of Chucky
216,stephaleigh101,A good scare but lots of plot holes.,7,4 January 2014,"For anyone who has watched the Chucky franchise since the release of Child's Play in the 1980s, it has been a good 25 to 30 years for the story to finally come to a close. The films have taken impressive turns, gone through plenty of plot changes, character development and even shifted in genres. The latest, and what I'm assuming is the final instalment, is called Curse of Chucky, which follows the fifth sequel Seed of Chucky that came out in 2004.The story follows a young paraplegic girl, Nica. She lives with her mother in a creepy looking house and tries to live a normal life and take care of herself. Chucky makes his debut within the first five minutes when he's delivered to Nica's house by an unknown person as he is in all the Chucky movies. Nica's mother is killed right off the bat, making Nica's sister and family come to the house to talk her into selling, using the reason that she has a disability and can't take care of herself.Unlike its predecessors, Bride of Chucky and Seed of Chucky, the sixth film has gone back to its Child's Play roots, focusing on horror rather than comedy. The Chucky doll has a new design that is sinister and is even scarier than the original doll from the first Child's Play film. Much like the Child's Play movies, the camera loves to do close up shots on the doll's face and one of the creepiest moments is when the doll's pupils dilate almost completely, leaving a tiny ring of blue. The most suspenseful and heart racing scenes often involve the doll sneaking around, appearing from nowhere and not saying a word.However, the doll's appearance was confusing in the beginning. Since Bride of Chucky, the doll has had stitching on his face and hands from when his wife Tiffany sewed his doll body together, but in this latest movie, the stitching is gone and he looks like a modernized, more terrifying version of what he looked like in Child's Play. It's not until later in the film that it's revealed Chucky does have the stitching on his face and he actually appears less scary than before.In terms of casting, it was pretty well done. Brad Dourif returns as the voice of Chucky/Charles Lee Ray and his daughter Fiona Dourif takes the role of the protagonist Nica. Jennifer Tilly comes back as Tiffany and even Alex Vincent makes a cameo appearance as Andy Barclay. The acting was well done and as always Brad Dourif does a wonderful performance as Chucky.The only real complaint I have about the movie is all the plot holes. In Seed of Chucky, the two dolls Chucky and Tiffany have kids and the movie ends on a cliffhanger. The viewer never finds out what happens to them but Tiffany is still alive and helping Chucky commit his murders. It is vaguely mentioned that he killed his family, but if that were true then why is Tiffany alive and why would she help him out if he murdered their kids? It makes no sense.As well, the ending shows Chucky performing his voodoo spell on Nica's young niece, making it seem like he's taking over her body (which is Chucky's main goal throughout the franchise) but then he shows up after the end credits as a doll at Andy Barclay's house.Also, in the last film, Chucky revealed that he was content being in a doll's body because he wouldn't get sick, old and eventually die; yet his main objective is to take over the niece's body. It's almost as if the writer only took small bits and pieces of the previous movies and ignored the rest. The story was still good and explained quite a bit about Chucky's back story but it also left far too much out.Overall, I would recommend the movie to any fans of the killer doll but I would also say be prepared for plot holes and some confusion. It has good scares, a decent story and overall it's a good movie.",Curse of Chucky
217,htrackstereo,"5 perfect movies, and then this...",1,11 July 2014,"I've been a fan of the Child's Play franchise more or less since birth, and why people are praising this installment baffles me. People keep saying it went ""back to its roots"". How? First off it completely bastardized the sociopath serial killer we've all grown to love as being a obsessive home-wrecker with an admiration for ..flowers. Watching this movie completely takes away from the previous films - if you chose to consider it (I won't). Also this is the first movie in the franchise to show any on screen nudity (that wasn't a doll) - how is that ""back to its roots""? Honestly, I think it's safe to guess that anybody praising this film hasn't watched a Chucky movie in a good decade, or care that much, but as a life long fan, this was sickening. The scene after the credits is proof enough that Mancini just wanted to give the fans what they've been asking for. Unfortunately fans don't write good movies, and this is proof. I am a true fan pleading, PLEASE GO BACK TO YOUR ROOTS (making fun unique movies). I'm sorry, but Curse Of Chucky is a pointless installment in the franchise and I am glad that it was straight to DVD because hopefully that will make it that much more forgettable.",Curse of Chucky
218,jaynetelfer,Terrible,1,19 October 2014,"While I enjoyed the original Chucky films, I found this one to be in poor taste. The whole thing is just terrible. Firstly, it does not tie in to any of the original films at all, it's like they are just trying to remake the films, secondly, the doll doesn't even look anything like Chucky as you can see from the films posters, and thirdly...CHUCKY NEVER LOOKED CUTE! This film has made Chucky look cute, in the original films, he never looked cute, he looked a bit odd, but not cute. I gave this a 1 star rating, and that was being generous, I found this particular version of Chucky, to be absolutely dreadful. Even the Bride of Chucky, which people count as the worst of the franchise, was better than this film, at least the bride of Chucky actually fit into the story, along with the seed of Chucky (fair enough that one was a bit weird. Even Child's Play were better films than this, even though they got a bit far fetched, I mean, there are only so many times your soul can die before its actually just poof, you are now permanently dead. This was just such a dreadful film, my partner and I never even watched the end of it, thats how bad it is, the least they could have done with this film is made it tie in somehow, or still had Chucky, looking like Chucky! I just absolutely hated this film, and I don't think they should even attempt to make another.",Curse of Chucky
219,shescountry-29181,Not old fashion,4,5 December 2015,First of all why would you want two girls making out I am disgusted because why would you want that and in the old movie they didn't have that lesbian scene in the old movie. Wasn't scary like the old Chucky and for God sakes if you are going to make a second make it scarier cause at the end their was a jump and I didn't even flinch. Hope you will make the second one MUCH better.I will give them props though it was a good story but everything happened too fast. Ever since I was 5 I watched Chucky and I thought that they would follow the story line and change it up a little. PLEASE make it much better and I'm surprised they didn't re-make Jaws that would be awesome but have Steven Spielberg direct it.,Curse of Chucky
220,marcgv-81393,The curse gets me angry,4,10 September 2020,"I don't usually write reviews. Only if I extremely enjoy a movie or it feels so wrong that I want to warn possible viewers.In this case it's for the second reason. This title made me ANGRY. For many reasons. Primarily and most of all, because it ignores the rules set by previous films. Chucky is less human, physically and mentally. He no longer bleeds. Why? I loved to see the doll hurt! And he has no deep real motivations. In the plot they try and fail to explain why he's murdering the characters. It's not believable or touching.There's the second problem I find. The plot doesn't get any deep until the end of the movie, and it still feels empty and disconnected from all child's play franchise settings. Any explanation for what is happening is shown briefly, used more like an excuse for slaughtering. The only thing that seems to matter to the director is getting a permanent eerie-gothic environment and some blood from time to time. Any story to support it will be secondary.Last thing that made me angry was the feeling of ""Hey! I am a horror movie! Do you feel it! Are you scared! I am a horror movie! Watch me!"". It is what I thought since the first shots. Come on! No one would live in such a manor in that state! That felt so unreal that I would not believe anything else following. But to keep up with the horror clichés, there's not only the manor, but all the dumb decisions from the characters, their plain personalities until the end, the dark filter from Instagram in every scene, underdeveloped conversations, a few hot scenes, loud jump scares, and more.Bad CGI is also an honorable mention.There were also a few good things, like the so original murders. But not much more.This movie is good for spending the afternoon if you have nothing to do, but I would recommend searching for other better titles unless you really want to watch all of the Child's Play saga.",Curse of Chucky
