0,MartinHafer,Destroyed by the camera-work.,3,19 August 2014,"When ""Coherence"" debuted this summer, it earned very, very little money. So far, since its release in June, this independent film has earned less than $69,000. So it's very, very likely a film you haven't yet seen. As for me, I am actually very thankful I didn't see it in the theater-- and it's for a reason you might not anticipate. It's not because the plot is bad (it's kind of interesting actually) but because the film has horrendous camera-work. I assume that the camera-work is supposed to be hip or exciting--but to me it is nausea-evoking and if I'd seen it on the big screen, I probably would have gotten a headache or begun vomiting. This is because the entire movie has a hand-held camera look and the picture almost never stays still. It almost always bounces around and won't stay on any one object. Now this might work for a very limited number of films--such as a 'found footage' film like The Blair Witch Project. So why, then, does the camera keep moving with a film like Coherence? And, why are some of the edits (particularly early in the film) so seemingly random and some shots out of focus? If you see it, you might just want to take a few Dramamine in order to cope with the camera's movement--which I expect with home movies but not with a film lasting nearly 90 minutes. Can the movie itself manage to overcome this annoying camera-work and make it all worthwhile?""Coherence"" is set during a dinner party where lots of disparate friends have come together for a nice evening of food and conversation. This occurs during a time when a comet has come very close to the Earth. Inexplicably, it seems to be causing some strange phenomena--such as cell phones which shatter and an internet which no longer functions during the course of their evening. However, the weird happenings get far weirder and the film begins to look a lot like The Twilight Zone-- especially like one of my very favorite episodes, The Monsters Are Due on Maple Street. Not surprisingly, the guests all begin to freak out and paranoia and fear begin to grip them. What, exactly, do they experience? See the movie if you want to know.The film turns out to have some positive things going for it. The story is quite creepy and its creepiness is heightened by the music and mood-- and it gets creepier as the film progresses. With better camera-work, it really would have had a lot more chance to work. Now this isn't saying that the script is perfect. A few of the friends at the party are a bit broadly written and annoying--and you question why the other people would associate with them (such as the lady who is into mysticism and the 'funny guy'). But the story is a good example of making the most of a simple idea and setting.For me, the camera-work was unfortunately a deal-breaker. In other words, it was so bad that it really ruined the film. However, I should point out that if you read the reviews on IMDb, you'll find the film has two extreme reactions for the viewers--they either really liked it a lot and didn't seem bothered by the awful technical aspects of the film or they hated it. There really aren't too many reviewers with neutral views on the film--it has a truly bi-modal distribution for all you statistics freaks out there. You'll apparently love it or hate it. With better and more professional looking camera-work, I might have been in the former group. But, as it is, I just cannot recommend it. I should point out, however, that there are parts of the film that show the filmmakers have promise and I would like to see more of their work in the future provided they do something about the film technique they use---please, no more camera-work that looks like it was done by attaching a mini-cam to a dog or cat!",Coherence
1,SnoopyStyle,an extended Twilight Zone episode,5,26 June 2015,"A group of acquaintances have a dinner party in L.A. A comet is passing through and things start going wrong. Cell phones break. Power goes out. Hugh and Amir go to a neighbor who still has power. They return with a box that contains ping pong paddles and pictures of everybody. Hugh tells them that there's a very similar dinner party at the other house. Mike, Laurie, Em, and Kevin go over to see for themselves. They encounter four similar people except they're holding red glow sticks instead of blue glow sticks. The group surmises that this is Schrödinger's cat where two possible outcomes both exist.For a no-budget, no-special effects, sci-fi movie, this works as much as can be expected. The idea belongs more to a hour long Twilight Zone episode. The scene, where the characters are first trying to figure out the situation, has a bit too much gobadigoop. They're pulling in things like the Tunguska event that doesn't add to their situation. The writing needs a little sharpening. The acting is perfectly good. There are a few recognizable faces but they're mostly second tier actors. It would probably help to make Emily Baldoni the single lead actress. Then the movie follows her POV which would make finding people from other realities more shocking. At one point, the characters from different realities get mixed up and I don't much care. Also with so many mash-ups, there should be a few doubles or triples. It's a cute Twilight Zone episode that is not that compelling, not mysterious and not scary at all. It has no thrills and muddied rooting interest.",Coherence
2,kosmasp,Talk a lot,9,31 December 2014,"It's the talk a lot movie. Something that might be distracting and annoying to some, but does feel real. Which is a major ingredient in a ""far out"" story/movie such as this one is. It gets very tricky from one point on, but I do believe it's still easy to follow and understand. We have a group of people, whom we ""dine"" with (not sure you could say we really learn much about them, but it's sufficient to get the story going and the tension flowing).Since this is low budget it does have to rely on acting and settings and it does a pretty good job on harnessing both those things (milking them?). It must have been a bit weird for the actors to get all the twists and turns and stay on path as the story moves along (as it is for the viewer), but it's a ride that is unique and worthwhile",Coherence
3,grantss,"Good, but could have been brilliant",7,28 September 2019,"Eight friends get together for dinner while a comet is passing overhead. After a power blackout across the neighbourhood strange events start occurring.A clever drama, with an interesting anchoring in scientific theory. Very intriguing, as the events unfold, especially as you don't know where this could or will lead. Due to the originality of the concept and plot, the options are almost endless.Unfortunately, that's where the movie falls short of greatness. Having presented this wonderfully original idea and developed the plot quite well around it, writer-director James Ward Byrkit doesn't quite know where to go with it. The ending is very disappointing, especially after all the potential the movie had for something profound or impactful.",Coherence
4,view_and_review,Wow Wow Wow,8,25 January 2016,"Wow. Just wow. That movie was insane! And I mean that in the most praiseworthy manner. It's been a while since I've seen a movie and was totally stupefied by it.A brief synopsis. ""Coherence"" is about alternate universes or alternate realities converging onto one single space or time or plane. That's the broader issue, but the more precise and singular issue is what would you do if you came to that realization? And more importantly, what would you do to ensure that you didn't end up in the wrong plane of reality? This movie is done so well for a few reasons. Firstly, the story is magnificent. The concept of alternate or parallel universes is an old one and it's always a fascinating one. And the concept is even more fascinating when done right as this movie did.Secondly, they don't overdo it. It's not a big budget sci-fi with all of the latest gadgets and bells and whistles. It's a party of regular folks that approach this phenomenon in a very regular and common sense fashion. You don't have to deal with the evil one with evil intentions, or the conniving one, or the one that does something dumb and illogical just to create drama for the movie, or the outrageously brave one that does something unnaturally dumb in the name of courage. I absolutely loved that. The characters, for the most part, were normal. You didn't hate any of them nor did you particularly love any of them. They were the kind of people you'd regularly meet in your regular neighborhood.Thirdly, the way the movie unfolded was very natural and organic so the wow factor was ten-fold. You were led down the path and given all of the necessary information but still there was more to be known and it was revealed awesomely.This movie was very brilliant. If I could nit pick--it would be the POV shots at times. For a moment I thought they were going the found footage route, but it turns out they would use that occasionally for a more intimate shot. It was effective and more enjoyable since I knew this wasn't a full found footage film. But FF style aside, this movie was masterful.",Coherence
5,evanston_dad,Losing One's Sense of Self,7,13 August 2020,"A group of intolerable privileged white people gather for a dinner party on a night when a comet is hurtling past Earth. Over the course of the evening, these people, who have very poor coping mechanisms, realize that there are infinite versions of themselves having infinite versions of the same dinner party, and things go awry when these versions of themselves get all mixed up and they lose track of who they started the evening with versus those that came to the party later. I never really understood why it mattered that much, since they're all still the same people, just different from each other by a couple of hours or so, and how much really happens to someone in a couple of hours? But I thought it best not to think too much about any of it.At first it was hilarious watching these people freak out over something as mundane as the power going out. They instantly go into panic mode and act like there's an alien invasion afoot. And then it was hilarious watching their problem solving skills kick into action when they realize that there are multiple selves wandering around all over the place (information which they pretty readily absorb, by the way). Their suggestions range from reading a physics book (just any physics book, mind you) to going out and murdering their other selves, a proposal that the others seem somewhat alarmed by but not as alarmed as you'd think people would be. The whole thing was apparently mostly improvised, and it shows. It's like they filmed the dress rehearsal and then decided to just release that as the actual movie. It's all pretty goofy, but I had a good time with it. It is fairly clever and kept me guessing, and the ending delivers a satisfying pay off.The only actor I recognized was Nicholas Brendon, though I couldn't begin to tell you from where. He's just one of those dudes you know you've seen before. But the best performance comes from Emily Baldoni, who's the closest thing to a lead this ensemble picture has.Grade: B+",Coherence
6,morrison-dylan-fan,Coherent coherence.,9,18 September 2016,"Talking to a fellow IMDber on the Horror board about the pretty good, taking place entirely in one location, Thriller-Horror The Invitation,I got recommended a similar film. Believing that I would have to buy the title on DVD,I was pleased to spot the flick on Netflix UK,which led to me finding out how coherent coherence could be.The plot:Talking to her boyfriend Kevin on the phone whilst driving to have dinner at Mike and Lee's place,Em's phone shuts down and the screen inexplicably cracks. Meeting the couple and their pal Beth,Em mentions that she has read that with a comet passing close to earth later tonight,that ""side effects"" can take place. Sitting round the dinner table with Beth,Mike and Lee being joined by fellow guests Kevin,Hugh and new couple Amir and Laurie. During their discussion about the comet,all the lights go out on the street-apart from the ones at their house and another nearby. Going to the nearby house on their own, Hugh and Amir discover that the residence in the other house are themselves.View on the film:Filmed over 5 days in the house he shared with his pregnant wife, (who gave birth in the house as scenes were shot by the front gate!) co-writer/(along with Alex Manugian) director James Ward Byrkit & cinematographer Nic Sadler corkscrew an incredibly unsettling,off- beat atmosphere,shaking the foundations of ""reality"" with jagged camera moves moving the ground under everyone's feet. Keeping the budget very low, Byrkit displays a pristine vision for using shimming effects to shatter the various realities,and earthy filters to glaze the film in a mesmerising, peculiar mood.Spending a year writing the screenplay, Byrkit and Manugian unveil a modern day Twilight Zone tale,which beams across the sky in tense Sci-Fi mystery and anxiety drenched unease. Unafraid to delve into complex subjects such as Quantum Physics,the writers cleverly use the friction from the alt realities to turn the dinner room into an (un)safe house,where Em and the other guests attempt to get a grip on the superbly-held time flux that the writers unleash on them.Giving the screenplay as a ""guide"" Byrkit brilliantly makes the Sci-Fi stand by tugging at the fragile strings between the group,with the meeting with themselves leading to questions of trusting the ""real"" version of themselves,as Em spots a path for her to start ""living her life.""Jokingly nodding towards his Buffy past, Nicholas Brendon gives a great performance as Mike,whose every-man charm Brendon starts to wear down,as the un-reality of the situation begins to hit. Desperately trying to figure out the reality they are in, Emily Baldoni gives a terrific performance as Em,as Em's initially collective manner gets wonderfully scrambled by Baldoni,as Em struggles to find coherence.",Coherence
7,FlashCallahan,I'm gonna collapse on them.....,9,21 February 2015,"Emily and her boyfriend Kevin are attending a dinner party at Mike's house. Kevin's ex- girlfriend Laurie will be there, making things somewhat tense for both Kevin and Emily. The dinner party goes well until the power shorts out following a comet sighting. They discover that a house down the road still has power and a few of them decide to investigate, only to find that something bizarre is occurring. Several strange and bizarre occurrences follow, leading them to the conclusion that the comet may have opened a doorway to a parallel universe.Bizarre, mind-bending, bonkers, awe-inspiring, jaw dropping science fiction movies are like buses. You wait for ages for one to come along and two come almost at once. Predestination is one, this, wonderful piece of work, is the other.And the reason that its so wonderful is because you cannot explain the film to somebody. If someone said 'go on, spoil it for me', you just couldn't. Not because it would ruin the ending, because its almost impossible to define the film in words. It has to be seen.The majority of the film is improvised by the cast, and for the first twenty minutes, it's all build up,getting to know the characters and how they interact with each other. It's pretty plodding stuff, but then the lights go off, and things go from bonkers, to genius, and finally the film leaves you with a big smile.But it's the concept that's so brilliant, knowing that there are not just parallel dinner parties, that would be a little too trite. It's the fact that there are not just several parallel dinner parties, but they are at different times too. A few hours behind, and a few hours in front etc, etc.And when these parties mingle in more ways than one, it becomes a more tense experience, knowing that they have gone from house to house, in different groups, will they ever get back to the same dinner party they first attended?Its a mind melting movie, with brilliant performances, and one hell of an ending.Seek it out, it's a perfect companion piece with Predestination.",Coherence
8,trashgang,blah blah,5,27 February 2015,"Okay, I saw positive reviews in the papers so I gave it a go but what i just saw wasn't my thing. I don't have any problems with films that make you think or weird arty flicks but this here was just blah blah and nothing really happening. Am I missing something, I guess because a lot of people liked it.The story is rather simple, a bunch of friends are having a dinner and when smartphones are breaking down no-one is thinking about what is going on. Sure, they all agree, a comet is near earth, is it that or are aliens among us? So finally they all meet themselves. looks great but again not really anything is happening except one making it out with another. It happened to me twice this month with different mags pushing me to watch what they think looks great. But from now on I will only follow my intuition.

9,deloudelouvain,Nice concept,6,11 February 2015,"Don't watch this movie if you are not really concentrated and focused because you will be doing a lot of thinking in this one. You can't miss a second or you won't get the story at all anymore. It's all a bit strange but in a good way. Normally I don't go for movies where I have to pain my braincells during the whole movie but with this one it was fine. The actors are good, the story is a bit far-fetched but intriguing. The only thing I didn't really like is that so many people talk at the same time. All in all it was worth a watch. I always read the critics before I start watching a movie so I was expecting a really good movie but to me it's just an OK movie, nothing more or nothing less.",Coherence
10,christopher-underwood,has you thinking and worrying all the time,9,3 December 2020,"Absolutely loved this. Now I can't pretend that I followed all the science here but it is possible that with as little understanding as I of Quantum Mechanics and the theory of Schrodinger's Cat, actually helps. It was certainly goosebumps and shivers down the spine for me throughout this as a seemingly ordinary set of well off folks try to settle into a dinner party, as a comet passes by. No major stars here and apparently much improvised dialogue within what is essentially a single set and yet this is so involving and scary. Hard to say too much without it spoiling the experience for others but, as far as I am concerned, something really different and stimulating that has you thinking and worrying all the time.",Coherence
11,siderite,Very interesting situational sci-fi,8,12 October 2014,"I have to admit most of the time I was smirking thinking all people there were idiots and that is why they should teach science in schools. But then you get to meet with that social idiocy that apparently appears in crisis situation when all the scared monkeys get together and all they can think about is flight or fight.The film is wonderfully original, feeling more like a play than a movie. The budget is tiny, it was not meant to be a special effects action, instead it is purely situational, with people just talking and reacting to changes in their environment. The subject... I don't know if I should talk about it. It is not a twist, but it is slowly revealed about a quarter in and I think I will leave you discover it for yourselves.The only problem I had was with the reactions of the people. Are they all crazy? Is it some American thing? I think you should watch it and make your own opinion. But do watch it.",Coherence
12,lasttimeisaw,"Coherence manages to spread out a cerebral sea-changing revelation, or at the very least, a very ghost of it",7,17 October 2016,"Filmmaker James Ward Byrkit's light flyweight feature debut fits intelligently in the low-budget indie Sci-Fi scene on the US soil after the millennium, with prominent precedents like works of Shane Carruth (PRIMER 2004, UPSTREAM COLOR 2013) and Richard Schenkman's THE MAN FROM EARTH, 2007).Shot sequentially in 5 days, almost exclusively in Byrkit's own house, COHERENCE has an ensemble of eight (all Byrkit's friends), who was separately given their own notes to indicate what they would do in the subsequent scenes, then they would just improvise their dialogues and actions without really knowing neither what exactly was happening, nor what their co-stars would react, barring the co-writer Alex Mangian (plays Amir), as the mole among them. This unconventional tack effectively enlivens an organic ferment crackling with confusion, confrontation, frustration, delusion and red-herrings (a granola empath also believes in chemical medicines, lol!), they are not brainiac geeks, but ordinary folks enwrapped in the bizarre parallel realities caused by quantum decoherence owing to a comet buzzing around close to the earth surface.Thankfully, Byrkit doesn't dwells on the aberrant phenomenon's theoretical nitty-gritty, as the more rarefied and esoteric PRIMER has done, instead he precipitates the hapless characters to make more decisions to further complicate and multiply their different universes (through variant dices and random items they choose to single their house out among numerous identical others), while past secrets, concealed affections are timely teased out to keep messing with their scrape, until one of them, Emily (Baldoni) steps up as a decisive force, who is disillusioned by her current reality - the strained relationship with her boyfriend Kevin (Sterling), the career setback as a dancer, and surreptitiously sneaks out to find an alternative universe where things haven't been influenced by their mind-boggling discovery, wishes for a refresh start.It is eyebrow-raising to see that as soon as they realize the existence of their doppelgängers, the knee-jerking reaction of Mike (Brendon), a former TV actor and alcoholic, is to kill the other self, as if wanton killing is the solution for everything. Why not just talk to another you and try to get a bigger picture of the whole idea? Where is one's natural curiosity? Nope, its $50,000 budget cannot afford to pull off that kind of special effect, thus, as a default choice, such a self-loathing inclination actually has been carried out in the final act, wound up with a suggestive twist in the next morning, when the comet has gone outbound to afar, there are two Emily stuck in this universe, which means there will be a distressed Mike futilely wandering around to look for his Emily in another reality. The curious thing is what happens next then? A sequel on the drawing board?COHERENCE's economical structure (not the cheap lightning or its sometimes vertiginous camera-work) precedes Paolo Genovese's acclaimed drama PERFECT STRANGERS (2016), both take place where a group of close-friends are enjoying their dinner while something usual is happening in the sky. Only the latter is a killjoy moral lesson sparked by a seemingly harmless game, which they all wish it had never happened; whereas the former, inventively juggles with the abstruse concept and trivial melodrama, manages to spread out a cerebral sea-changing revelation, or at the very least, a very ghost of it.",Coherence
13,Red-Barracuda,Complex concepts and lots of laughs - Coherence covers a lot of ground,7,29 June 2014,"A group of friends gather for a house party the night a comet passes very close to the Earth. Very strange events follow.Coherence is a very original movie. While it's a science fiction film, much of its attraction is the interplay between its talented ensemble of actors. The performances are all very good and naturalistic. I was curious to learn that this was achieved with a slightly experimental approach. The director only provided the actors with bare essentials when shooting scenes, there seemingly was no fully realised script. Consequently there was a great deal of improvisation and I think this has gone a long way to explaining why it came over so fresh and amusing so much of the time. There was a sort of Curb Your Enthusiasm vibe to proceedings, which of course was a TV show that adopted a similar approach to its shooting process. Whatever the case there is very good dialogue here in Coherence. It wouldn't have worked so well had the actors not been so good but these guys have done their homework and worked at this to the point that they have created a group of properly three-dimensional characters. Aside from these aspects, the sci-fi side of things deals with ideas of quantum coherence, which is a rather high-brow concept for a movie to be based on – and one that I can't pretend to fully understand - but in a nutshell it boils down to characters encountering different outcomes in their life and coming face to face with their doppelgangers – this all being set into motion by the close encounter with the comet. It all gets quite complex and would no doubt benefit from repeat viewings but the central idea is pleasingly distinctive. Overall, it's a very commendable effort that deserves to receive a proper release, as it is certainly set up so that it will appeal well beyond the sci-fi community. Coherence turns out to be a real find.",Coherence

15,Pjtaylor-96-138044,Infinite improv.,7,29 May 2020,"'Coherence (2013)' is surprisingly coherent considering its potentially incoherent premise and low-budget, experimental execution. See, the piece is almost entirely improvised by its actors, who were each given specific and sometimes contradictory 'goals' instead of actual lines or, even, a vague idea of the overall plot. Because of this, the thing has a distinctly 'realistic' feel, with its characters almost always talking over each other and stumbling through awkward observations about their current situation. This does, at times, lead to a somewhat intangible sense of chaos that both helps and hurts the experience. There is undeniably a unique atmosphere to the affair and it feels grounded in the best of ways, but it also often feels slightly clumsy and unsure of itself. Still, its core experiment certainly succeeds; it tells a compelling and, even, clever tale without the use of traditional Holywood techniques. The movie's low-budget is even more impressive due to its sci-fi slant, which calls for some complex concepts to be shown visually as well as discussed aurally. Without any real special-effects, the picture convincingly portrays such events with style. It's impressive, really. The same can be said for the experience at large. Even though it's always close to tripping over itself and it sometimes seems to move in circles, it's consistently engaging and intriguing. It's also truly unique. Just when you think you have it figured out, you remember all those cuts to black. 7/10",Coherence
16,bowmanblue,Only just coherent,6,19 February 2018,"If you're like me, you may well cynically see today's crop of sci-fi films as nothing more than the same story involving superheroes flying around New York fighting aliens repeated over and over again. Therefore, I do try to check out slightly lower-budget offerings which rely on story over effects and characters over star-power. Therefore, I thought I'd give 'Coherence' a go as I stumbled across it on a popular internet streaming service.Six friends (who are only just slightly different from Joey, Ross, Phoebe and co!) are having a dinner party when their night of social small-talk and cheese and biscuits is interrupted by a comet hurtling over their heads. And, as pretty as it looks in the background of one of their selfies, it proves to split reality creating an alternate version of reality before they've had a chance to down their second glass of wine.Now, whenever a film presents the audience with 'countless realities' or time travel, or some other concept which requires careful attention to details when it comes to plot, really does need to keep things clear for viewers without confusing them. 'Coherence' just about managed that. It's certainly not a film you can go into too much details about when it comes to plot, as most of what I say may give away spoilers. The main thing I'd say is that you really do need to pay attention, so don't you dare risk a toilet break without pausing the film as you may end up returning to a completely different set of characters compared with who you left!The cast do their best with what they're given in terms of script - mainly it involves looking confused and/or scared while trying to offer theories as to what's become of their evening. There's certainly no big name stars (unless you count 'Xander' from the 'Buffy' TV show!), but they do enough to make you believe that they're a close-knit bunch of friends who have known each other for a long time.If you're desperate for a science fiction film that does its best to offer a concept that is completely 'special effects and explosions-free' then you'll certainly find one here. I did find it a little hard going in places and it feels more like a straight-to-DVD film than anything you'd actually pay to watch in the cinema.",Coherence
17,gbill-74877,Decent low budget science fiction flick,7,4 January 2020,"Interesting idea, and there's an organic feeling to the low-budget production. I'm not sure the development of the story around Schrödinger's superposition theory translated as well as it could have with the passing comet and people in different realities wearing different colored glowsticks, but the film has tension, and it's entertaining to guess what's going on.

18,secondtake,Doppleganger heaven--the script not quite convincing but very natural acting--fun!,6,1 March 2015,"Coherence (2013)A twisty, semi-sci-fi improbable movie with enough fun antics and mind bending ideas to make it work. The basic idea has been visited often lately—there are more than one of us out there. The closest parallel is ""The One I Love"" which has the different versions of people encounter each other in oblique ways, but it occurs differently in ""Sliding Doors"" which is even mentioned in this film.Which is to say: not quite original.But the ensemble acting is so solid and natural all along, it makes the improbable slightly believable. If you don't buy the wobbly science (they confuse a comet with a meteor, it seems, when talking about Finland, and the whole coherence idea which is apparently only true for subatomic physics) you can at least see yourself in these rather ordinary people. Well, upper middle class educated people. Eight of them have gathered in a suburban house for dinner. A phone screen cracks mysteriously. The comet is mentioned. And then the lights go out. Fine so far, armed with candles and glow sticks. Then one guy sees a house two blocks away that has its lights one.And the credibility is strained even on non-cosmic aspects. Because, for example, this lighted up house scares them, even after they realize it might have a generator (and even after their own generator turns on). And then they are scared to walk outside and ask the house to use their phone—in the sweet warm suburbs? Hmph.These little things matter—like hinting at dangers that we don't really feel are dangers, but now that they are hints we come to suspect some foul play or weird effects ahead. Still, there is the creepy sensation of sensing you might have a second—or third— version out there. And that you might meet, and then? Exactly—then what? It gets startling and spooky and fun. It resolves slightly by the end, with a final cliffhanging phone call.Nothing brilliant here despite the underlying strains of intellectualism. But it's natural and a good lightweight game.",Coherence
19,A_Different_Drummer,Beyond clever ... an astonishing accomplishment,10,3 March 2017,"This is a belated review, I missed the film on first release but am overjoyed a friend tipped me to it.This review done in 2017. The reason that is important is because I recently did a review of ARRIVAL in which I reviewed the history of the so-called ""smart"" sci-fi arcs (essentially, movies that make you really really THINK to enjoy them) and concluded that, of the bunch, ARRIVAL was the best.Had I seen coherence, however, my vote would have been different. It is hands down the ""smartest"" of the ""smart arcs"" I have ever seen and likely may ever see.Extraordinary.First, this film was produced on a shoestring, with an ensemble cast, and a lot of ad-libbed dialog. Extraordinary.Second, the editing is as tight as anything I have ever seen. The more attention you pay to what is happening, the more nervous you get. Extraordinary.Third (and pardon me for bringing in this topic) the science is far from crazy. The so-called ""Mandela Effect"" phenomenon happened in 2015 to 2016 (dozens of Youtube videos) and the attempts to explain it using quantum physics are very close to the explanations in this film. (In some of the Youtube videos, sufferers of the ME are crying into their webcams because their world has been turned upside down and they do not know why.) Finally, the acting is excellent, especially the lead, Emily Baldoni, who shows that she can carry an entire film with facial expressions and empathy ... and deserves much stronger roles than she has been getting.Extraordinary in every sense.",Coherence
20,westsideschl,Dumb,1,19 January 2015,SPOILER: A near copy of a movie made a couple of years ago in which a group of people at a party see duplicate copies of themselves and are trapped in this suddenly appearing parallel dimension.Besides being so low budget that 99% of the movie is people in a room (a few times venturing outside but mostly not shown - that's real low budget) and talking or for excitement they might argue. A lot of high school drama class acting (stand and stare and limit dialogue to 10 small words or less). Script consists of usual party chit chat with usual infidelity to spice it up. Clichéd. Another middle school science level intelligent treatment of the myth about comets somehow connected to Schrödinger's Cat paradox which if you really want to understand it then study your math and physics - don't watch dumbed down interpretations even below Popular Science.

In the same cinematic reality, direct video presentation as The Blair Witch Project (1999), Coherence offers a stark, deeply colored, hued and gritty feel of Lars von Trier's Melancholia (2011). In a more serious, less comical series of parallelisms like Frequently Asked Questions About Time Travel (2010) or Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind (2004), Coherence is surprising in its simplicity and eventual frightening discovery into the darkness of the fantastic unknown from the lighted save environs of a residential home. Besides a rather abrupt ending which isn't quite as satisfying as Another Earth (2011) and sometimes a rather chaotic, though perhaps necessary hard to keep track of puzzling weirdness, Coherence is significantly different, well acted, and intriguing in its varied similarities. The overall emotional tone eventually is much darker than an entertaining night in bed with a cozy sci fi adventure book.",Coherence
22,sol-,And Soon the Darkness,8,26 November 2016,"Dinner party plans turn awry for a group of friends during a power blackout in this mind-bending science fiction film in the style of 'Primer', best entered into with as few expectations as possible. Without revealing too much, it can be mentioned that the characters gradually come to the conclusion that a parallel universe exists in the darkness, which leads to debate and heated discussion about what to do. Tensions soon flare as the phenomenon causes characters to reveal secrets and hatch plans that eerily backfire and the film solemnly ends up reinforcing the idea that we are always our own worst enemy. Little else can be said without ruining a fresh experience, but suffice it to say that the film also provides food for thought in terms of trust, discomfort, paranoia and guilt; the open-ended conclusion is pitch-perfect too. Not everything about the script is airtight. The characters warm to the notion of parallel universes a little too easily without any real skepticism; they all also seem to have an incredibly good grasp of quantum physics notions for laymen. Never to mind, the film prods sharply enough where it counts to deliver an unnerving experience not easily forgotten and lead actress Emma Baldoni (nee Foxler) undergoes some incredible turns towards the end. This is also one of those films for which the more one thinks about it afterwards, the more important seemingly throwaway early dialogue is. The dinner story of a woman claiming to have killed her husband after a comet passed overhead resonates particularly strongly when the movie is over.",Coherence
23,filipemanuelneto,"A regular independent film, which seems to have neglected the most technical aspects.",2,30 March 2020,"Low-budget independent films are boxes of surprises. You never know if they are excellent or crap. This film seemed like a good bet, with a plot based on a group of friends who get together for dinner during the passage of a comet that, in a somewhat mysterious way, causes a series of problems such as the Internet and electricity failing, broken cell phones and , stranger still, a juxtaposition of parallel realities.I thought it would be more of a psychological horror film, and I believe there are scenes where some inroads are made in this field, but the suspense and the clever mystery created end up standing out. However, the characters are poor and very cliché, and the whole story becomes so strange that it quickly loses credibility. At one point, it all sounds so surreal that it doesn't really matter what really happened there. Another annoying thing was having so many characters talking on top of each other during the film. If it happens on time it makes things more authentic, but if it is always happening it is too much. None of the actors are known, the bet was on unknown names, but with experience in indie films and sporadic participation in TV series (Emily Baldoni, Maury Sterling, Nicholas Brendon etc.).The film uses sound effects and music quite well to increase suspense and become more tense. Being a low budget film it is not surprising that there is only one filming location and that it is a relatively poor film. What is more difficult to forgive is the rather amateur work of filming, with most scenes so shaky that it seems that the cameraman was nervous. Another thing that is not easily forgiven is the deficient editing and post-production work. These are details that may seem of less relevance but that can lose the chances of a serious film career.",Coherence

25,jtindahouse,Just lacking some polish,7,7 December 2016,"From what I read 'Coherence' was filmed in a very strange and interesting way. Usually we associate improvisation with comedies, so to see it used in a film that is attempting to be very complex is something entirely new. There are going to major positives and major negatives with using such a style. The positives are that you are going to get some very genuine interactions between characters who will be genuinely baffled as to what is going on. On the other hand your story isn't going to be as polished as you may like. Things that you would like to give extra impotence to aren't going to be as easy. However, it has to be said that they did a fantastic job in the editing room to cover up any flaws. I didn't know as I watched it that it had been improvised, and I would never have guessed that was the case.It's a fun film with infinite possibilities that could have been explored. I wasn't sure watching it how exactly they were going to go about ending it. They went down a route that I wouldn't call perfect, but did lead to an interesting little scenario that allowed them to end it on a mysterious cliffhanger. For a film maker that was in debut film I thought writer/director James Ward Byrkit did an excellent job with an ambitious project. It's not a perfect film, but it certainly is a fun ride.",Coherence

27,estebangonzalez10,An entertaining sci-fi film exploring our singularity,7,28 February 2015,"""There is another theory: that two states continue to exist separate and decoherent from each other, each creating a new branch of reality based on the two outcomes.""James Ward Byrkit's debut film is without a doubt one that will have you talking and discussing with your friends no matter how you feel about it. It's a low budget sci-fi film that seems taken out of a Twilight Zone episode and it is consistent with what we have seen in other films this year exploring the doppelgänger effect (The Double, Enemy, and The One I Love). The screenplay is well thought out and the story is brilliantly put together, and despite not being a fan of surreal films I actually enjoyed this quite a bit. The dialogue in this film is very casual (Byrkit claims that the characters were allowed to improvise their lines) and it gives the movie a sense of authenticity. The sci-fi elements of the film are enhanced by the eerie score. Many people seemed to have enjoyed this much more than I did and I can understand why. The film's short running time will garner many re-watches and there are already several interesting theories online about the film's ending and the clues that Byrkit leaves behind.The film focuses on a group of eight friends who get together for a dinner party. There is a comet that is going to pass over during the night and some electrical disturbances are expected. During the dinner they begin to experience some problems with their cellphones and there is a power cut in the entire neighborhood. Only one house about two blocks away seems to have energy so two people from the group decide to check the place out and see if they can figure out what is going on. Some surreal events ensue after that and the less you know about them going into the film the better off you are.Byrkit does a great job of building the tension through the conversations these friends have with each other. The performances from the relatively unknown cast are all solid and in order to give the film an even stronger sense of authenticity it is filmed in documentary style with shaky cameras and several in and out of focus images, which I thought were a bit too distracting. Coherence also suffers from being too talky at times since there is a lot of exposition and explanation of theories in order for us to understand what is going on. I still want to give the film credit for exploring a familiar subject matter in a quite inventive and original way. Byrkit does a lot with the few resources he had to work with and he should have no trouble in getting his next project financed after this. Coherence is a film you just have to sit back and enjoy for what it is: an entertaining sci-fi film exploring our singularity and how far we would go to defend our individuality. http://estebueno10.blogspot.com/",Coherence

The microbudget style grows on you.,7,13 November 2014,"Initially the premise reminded me of last year's brilliant and hilarious It's A Disaster but the approach couldn't be more different. This is what Shane Curruth's Primer might've been like if he had shot it 10 years later. Coherence says a lot about what can be done with zero budget these days. It makes no attempt to be cinematic, having a home video aesthetic that's close to found footage, but you get used to its rushed intimate photography and quick cutting. There's a great energy about it. It helps that its sound mixing is crisp and densely layered with all the improvising. It covers more ground in the dialogue than anything. It may not be realistic, but it feels authentic. It makes believing its premise a lot easier too, which on its initial revelation is brilliant. The film does get quite goofy with it, but it's always engaging. It's a little overcrowded with its characters but Emily Baldoni is terrific as the film's lead. The way the film plays her ultimate moral dilemma is great. Coherence isn't a consistent film, and it particularly suffers from major contrivances near the end of its second act, but I can see why it's become one of the most talked about under the radar movies of the year.7/10",Coherence

The characters were interesting, and it was also nice to see them together in a room. A good storyteller knows how to make a movie with just people sitting in a room and talking. That's, in my opinion, how you know a storyteller is great. This movie also goes beyond that and introduces an external conflict outside the setting of the home. And yet, it's basically the same place.Coherence is about a group of friends getting together for a dinner party. Mysterious things begin to happen, and they discover that there is a parallel universe that is communicating with them. Crazy things start to happen, and they begin to see themselves walking around, unsure of who they are.It's a really great movie. It explores other dimensions, space, and things like that.

They received a box with their pictures with seemingly random numbers in their back and a ping pong paddle. They were constantly going out and coming back and they thought they should throw a dice to give numbers to their own pictures and put them in a box so that they can make sure they're real them. When Em compared the ones they received and their numbers, they asked them the numbers they had in the box they received and everyone was not real oneself except for Beth and lee. Beth never left the house and lee was sleeping on the drug mixture that Beth gave to her. The actor wanted I scare the other group so that they won't go out to find the book that made them learn about the schrodinger phenomenon. He said it'd be a shocking secret for himself to prevent him to go out. Because the persons exchanged, somebody left a note from underneath the door saying Beth and him and a book club which means Beth cheated on Hugh with him years ago. He tried to explain that they're not actually them but they started to argue and things escalated further and Em then left the house and wandered through the widow of alternate realities of her. At one of them her hands was covered with blood and she probably beat Laurie because she was trying to seduce his husband who's also her ex boyfriend. When she found the seemingly good alternative, she killed herself when the group came out when the windshield of Hugh was broken and put her in the truck of her own car and took the ring. But she was back at the house trying to reach the bathroom, she again hit herself in the head and put the body in the bathtub and she passed out in the living room. When she woke up in the morning Beth had taken a shower and lee was preparing the breakfast and her husband was out there and he found the other ring which is identical to her and she ended up having the same ring twice and she herself was calling her husband. It was amazing and the book detail and some dialogues between Beth and Laurie and everything was so amazing to coherently see who's from where and who's actually oneself.

It starts as a normal dinner party among 8 friends (50/50 men/women, some couples, some single). We see a few peculiar events serving as a warming up, like cracked phone displays happening to two people independent of each other, both without any logical cause. The dinner party starts and progresses as usual, visualized with a series of clearly delineated shots, nothing out of the ordinary.Then suddenly the lights go out. Luckily, there are candles and boxes with portable torches to the rescue. There is one house further in the street that is not dark, and some want to go there in the hopes of a working landline phone or an Internet connection. From that moment on, one confusing event follows another, steadily building up the tension until everyone gets lost in the confusion, and (I regret to say) the latter includes the viewer.It is nice that all eight participants have an active role in the proceedings, unlike many other movies where some alpha males take the lead and the rest follows obediently. This is particularly not the case here, in fact a compliment for the script writers.Later on in the running time, we wind up all confused by the multitude of parallel worlds that seem to exist. Not only that, they also interfere with each other. It is not easy for us to keep them all apart, in spite of the film makers trying to help us by means of torches with different colors. Still more out of the ordinary is that no other people than our eight main characters appear in the street, not even when they go out of the house and don't meet a single person beyond their own company of eight. This defies my logic. It looks like these eight people are the only ones on earth left. That cannot be true since there is no destructive impact of any sort in sight.How to distinguish between different parallel universes, and making sure to have returned in the ""correct"" company? The idea with the photos and the dice plus a random object, and to wrap that into a package to create something unique, is a very good one. The fact that all the separate universes we see arrive at a similar idea is remarkable, but it can be explained out of the fact that the same characters with the same backgrounds are involved. Though a bit ""logical"" when thinking hard about it, yet it stretches our imagination more than necessary. All in all, the story develops evenly paced and there were no boring moments.

As the event gets closer and closer strange things start to happen and what at first looks like coincidences soon becomes something altogether more sinister.Now this was shot over five nights with dialogue that was mostly improvised. Some of the camera work is a bit shaky but is done to affect immediacy and also give that 'fly on the wall' feeling that does add to the intimacy of the film. Those who are fond of theoretical physics will be pleased at the references to Schrödinger's cat. Those that like a good ghost story should be pleased also.This is one of those films that will annoy some, bewilder a few and hopefully reward the many that stick with it.

All the more regrettable is that one of the reasons is the movie's putting me in mind of the 2009 British-Australian film ""Triangle"" which bears some resemblance in having a hot Melissa George wandering around a ship (and then back on land) with an axe, in a skimpy T-shirt, chasing herself; whereas here with ""Coherence"" we have a hot Emily Baldonu wandering around in a skimpy T-shirt with no axe, chasing herself... Admittedly, anomalous events in ""Triangle"" seem to be a time loop in which realities continually spring into existence and overlap, whereas in ""Coherence"" we seem to have repeat divergence into separate universes generated by a comet whose presence allows the realities to go on interacting with each other as they normally would not.But while ""Coherence"" focuses in on a suburban dinner party at night (and is staffed by not-very-well-known actors), ""Triangle"" has a pretty-deserted ship, with sun, sea and - significantly - seagulls. So maybe ""Coherence"" has better dialogue and is a bit more anchored in normality, but ""Triangle"" is more visually interesting and exciting and scary ... and (in my case, as in ""reality"" ... hopefully???) it CAME FIRST. All of that means that I'm being a bit unfair in comparing films, and that those with more limited sci-fi experience may indeed find ""Coherence"" a satisfying and novel watch; and it does OK with its premise, even if it is likely to lose most watchers on the detail, no matter how they try.

But the story must be about the characters, and be a single story, not toying with the many ways the premise can be interpreted.It's a mistake for two reasons. First, it takes the story away from people. Good stories are about people, not a science lecture. It just doesn't make sense that the characters are so logical and getting out dice, when there could be emotional points to make. Too many scientific themes are explored and not enough personal ones. For example, it's not clear which of the characters this story is ""about"", the protagonist we're supposed to identify with.Also, and this is not a spoiler (it's in the movie poster) for a film about doubles...

Far too many to list here, that's for sure, and it's no more nonsensical than people who believe in astrology, thinking their lives are mapped out my the planets & stars.

51,phenomynouss,Schrödinger's Mindfk,10,20 May 2018,"Suddenly springing out at the top of AmazonPrime's recommended films, this one had an interesting enough synopsis for me to give it a chance. I was almost starting to regret it at the beginning, when suddenly the protagonist's cell phone shatters in her hand out of nowhere.
This may seem like a rather cheap shock and something of a red herring, but it was just the right sort of hook to get me through the initial 20 or so minutes in which we are essentially sitting in on a mundane house party among adult friends. I was put slightly in the frame of mind of another movie, ""The Invitation"" which starts similarly and which I rather enjoyed for its atmosphere of perpetual paranoia and anxiety. With this film, it takes a similar path, though decidedly less subtle, as ""Stuff Goes Wrong"" occurs rather upfront with a power outage and some odd noises outside.I desperately do not want to spoil this film except to say that it is basically influenced by Quantum Coherence/Decoherence and this dictates how the entirety of the movie flows. The second act revelations begin with comparisons to the Schrödinger's Cat thought experiment, but it is very much focused thereon out with quantum decoherence. Out of necessity, some plot convenience occurs in this regard, as they begin to figure out and hypothesize openly about quantum decoherence as it applies to their situation, while casting all blame on the cause of it being the comet overhead.
Despite this seemingly un-toppable sci-fi anomaly revealed and somewhat explained, rather than turn into a boring ""how do we fix this"" adventure plot, it continues to heighten the mystery while also remaining grounded in reality; the members of the party are well aware of the insanity going on, yet still get into fights with one another when intricate plots go wrong and compromising personal information and secrets end up revealed.
Yet these interpersonal issues never supersede the overall tension, managing to only heighten it further, and in some cases intertwine with it, as in the example of Mike, who is afraid that the anomalous events will lead to violent reactions from him and ""others"". New elements keep getting added to further exacerbate the tension and anxiety (most especially the ""Box"" with the numbers and the items inside)
The human element is never separated from the quantum mechanics at play, and arguably the end result is the logical outcome of the colossal stress, anxiety, and perpetual ""Capgras-esque"" paranoia afflicting the protagonists all throughout.
This film is astonishingly low budget, and never manages to look, sound, or feel low budget. I would never have realized if not for seeing in the IMDB trivia that much of the dialogue and interactions were improvised. The style and the complex science (rendered relatively simple in this film) draws a favorable comparison to ""Primer"" (2004), but this is definitely its own film.",Coherence

They spend a lot of time trying to figure out what's going on and if they're in the right house etc. Problem is they were wrong and there's actually an infinite amount of versions of themselves. There's one scene in it where the blonde realizes her boyfriend isn't actually her boyfriend that is eerie and great. Basically she winds up figuring out a different versions of herself has a better life so she kills different versions of her and to try and take her life.

Oh, the movie itself, about a group of friends? that get together for diner and a comet viewing that seems to knock them into a multidimensional rift and the struggle to keep hold of the real? reality. I'll get the actors out of they way. They were not very good at all. That doesn't distract from a decent somewhat story though so just deal with their bland portrayals. Expect a movie that will take every chance it can to confuse you. No matter how you look at it, the end will make you wonder what just happened. That is assuming you bother following the whole movie from beginning to end and realistically a lot of people will lose interest for two reasons, the acting and the confusing nature. I read a bunch of reviews trying to peg the whole story and my take is far more simple. A great deal of ideas of the theory of multiverses were used in a very simplistic way and the writers just mashed them together. I don't think this movie is set out to actually ever answer a single question at all (hence the ironic title of ""Coherence"") The makers of the film are poking fun at the word alone and allowing the audience to make of it what they will. If you overthink the color of the sky long enough, it will become whatever you come up with and that is what all the messages about this movie seem to say. So kudos for making people think, but I don't think even the writers had an end just like this movie may not have even had a beginning. Here is one persons take so take it with a grain of salt.

Low budget, shaky cam, canned atmosphere, no stellar cast and the absence of a screenplay per se are visible in each frame of the movie and the only thing actually moving it forward and making you stay until the ending is a desire to find out something you haven't seen before but ""mystery resolved"" is not about this movie.

68,ghost_dog86,"A film only a fan of ""The Big Bang Theory"" could love.",8,2 September 2014,"""Coherence"" is a low budget sci-fi film, full of tight camera shots (in an obvious attempt to avoid spending money on extras and production design) and was only at my local theater for a grand total of one week.Also, it's quietly one of the best films of the summer. Writer/director James Ward Byrkit puts his unique twist on the sci-fi genre with his 89 minute feature film surrounding a dinner party where an oddly paranoid yuppie group of acquaintances consisting of friends, an ex-girlfriend and the guy from ""Roswell"" (or is it?) have conversations about Schrodinger's Cat (fans of ""The Big Bang Theory"" will know what I'm talking about) and a mysterious comet passing overhead, right before all hell breaks loose in a multi-dimensional kind of way. I can't reveal much more than that, nor would I want to. In fact, the less one knows about what happens next, the more fascinating ""Coherence"" becomes. And more importantly, the more forgiving audiences will be of its budgetary flaws (the casting, the multitude of poorly lit sequences, the lack of stunt coordination and did I mention, the casting?). Though ""Coherence"" does take more than a few minutes to get acclimated to, with all of its abrupt cuts (which makes more sense as the film moves forward) and the annoyance of having to listen to a naturalistic mishmash of voices which stems from multiple conversations happening at once (an aspect with an actual dinner party would contain) as this film pressed forward with the perfect amount of lean-forward-in-your-seat tension and twists, it became much more than I expected. Resulting in (as far as the story is concerned) yet another sci-fi film better than ""Snowpiercer"" and maybe the most impressively outside of the box, low budget sci-fi film I've seen since ""Primer"" or ""The Man from Earth"". Final Thought: Every once in a while an indie horror/sci-fi filmmaker comes forth with an initial feature that will serve as a calling card as he/she cements their name within the genre (e.g. James Wan with ""Saw"" or Ti West and ""The House of the Devil"", or Shane Carruth and ""Primer"") . In the case of ""Coherence"", even though the story is far better than the restless direction, which I suspect has a lot to do with budget constraints; it is undeniable that Byrkit will be a director to watch out for in the near future. ""Coherence"" is definitely worth checking out during these late August/early September months when the theater is filled with mediocre big-budget films that production companies have dumped on us like so many buckets of ice water during a drought.",Coherence

71,d_m_s,Nah,4,13 October 2015,"A bunch of characters at a dinner party experience a lot of weird goings on, seemingly induced by a comet passing overhead. Asside from some annoying acting and inexplicable and frustrating character actions and sub plots, the film starts out quite good. It builds up a lot of little mysteries and gets very confusing as the characters learn that not only is there a separate group of themselves in another house up the road experiencing the same weird goings on, but in actual fact there are many parallel universe situations all going on for this group of people and they have all crossed over at this point in time, seemingly caused by the comet. What's good is the little mysteries that build up and how it keeps you thinking about what could be going on. I liked the fact the film tricked me into thinking there were only 2 parallel universes we were dealing with when in fact it was many. However, the bad points, which let me to give a score of 4 for this film, are the inexplicable character actions and dialogue that doesn't make a lot of sense. An example of this is that the characters several times bump into themselves from one of the parallel universes. However, instead of doing what I feel would be more natural and interesting - which would be to try to interact with my other self because that would be weird and amazing and surely naturally what you would want to do - they either just run away or back off slowly without speaking. This felt wrong to me and as if the writer did not know how to deal with the situation so had the characters running away. What let it down most of all was the ending, which felt like a rushed conclusion and, to be honest, not very convincing. On top of that, it left open aaaaaaaall the mysteries it had built up along which, to me, is a sign of a very poor writer - i.e. someone who can throw in loads of mysterious subplots but then is not able to develop them or bring them to a satisfying conclusion. It was like the writer had thrown in as many inexplicable points as possible and then just ended the film abruptly in order to not have to explain any of it. While some people may argue sometimes things are better left open to interpretation I would say that I agree this technique works when character actions are open to interpretation and little mysteries are left open so that there is room for imagination. However, in the case of Coherence, it just isn't done in such a clever way so rather than feeling like some things have been left open so that they can be discussed, it instead feels like random subplots and character actions were thrown in as discussion points but they don't work as there are too many inexplicable points and they don't go anywhere.

The writers (director James Ward Byrkit and Alex Manugian who also played the role of Amir) had only written just story and established rules while most of the witty dialogue were improvised by actors themselves, thus proving that the film doesn't need some superstars, but rather talented ensemble cast. Although the hand-held camera-work might seem to take viewer out of the story, it was just another way to give more room to the improvisation. Despite all of that the film manages to keep an eerie atmosphere, and the story movies on one continuous flow without getting sidetracked. The story also doesn't crumble into pieces under it's own ambitions. The twists hold together and actually makes sense.

If a movie succeeds then it must have done something right.Unfortunately, some films just take that recipe too literally. Instead of feeding you some premise, character complexity and development, plot twists or any other stuff that we would call ""deep"", so that you digest it and produce the high-grade refined emotions you could really enjoy and relish, they try to inject some raw emotions into you directly, either by showing some messed up freaky stuff or using the scary music or employing the shaky cam, jump scares etc. That would also be emotional, but those emotions would be fake, easy to experience but fast to wither away. A drama on steroids, so to speak.Coherence if a film of a latter type, taking the cheap route to your attention. Could it take the hard and honest way? Probably not, because it didn't have much to offer to begin with. Several friends, some with a previous history, not necessarily pleasant, gather in a country house in the middle of the night when a comet is passing by the Earth. Alone by itself, it's not much to build upon. So let's introduce a completely nonsensical aspect of comets being able to affect people's minds and even ""enhance"" it with an utterly pseudoscientific mumbo jumbo so that it allows introducing some dramatic and intense consequences.There are movies that actually pull off the same trick but do it with enough dignity and skill to remain consistent and enthralling. The One I Love is a great example of that. A similar premise - a troubled couple goes to a secluded place to face some unexplainable and mysterious things and the inner demons of their own relationship - but played on with so much more maturity and wit that it makes an eerily sharp impression and leaves a long, although somewhat troubling, aftertaste.Coherence, however, just starts a storm in a teacup by throwing lots of random stuff in the same pile. Instead of exploring the character unfolding possibilities, it concentrates on the primordial things like the fear of dark and dumbs down the more advanced aspects of the characters' behavior to keep the fuss going. And that desperate attempt to keep the audience confused conceals nothing but a complete lack of logic or essence of the things that happen.There's one redeeming trait about Coherence that makes it enjoyable. And, quite paradoxically, it's the sincerity of all that goofing around. It's easy to be a smart@ss in front of the screen and ridicule the silly people making the silly decisions. However, most of us would be running around screaming madly after even a half of batsh!t crazy stuff that happens in this film.

The film begins with the simple premise of a dinner party gone wrong, and uses the concept of alternate realities to expose the flaws in its characters, and that is what truly makes this film great: it has mind-bending sci-fi concepts, but these concepts are simply tools used to create more tension between the characters. Alfred Hitchcock famously described suspense as this: ""A bomb is underneath the table and the public knows it, probably because they have seen the anarchist place it there. The public is aware that the bomb is going to explode at one o'clock and there is a clock in the decor. The public can see that it is quarter to one"". In ""Coherence"", the ""bomb"" would be the instability of the characters and their relationships. Each one clearly has a dark side that is just beneath the surface, and the strange events that occur with the meteor make them more paranoid and less trustworthy of each other and themselves, driving them each to the brink of insanity and slowly causing their relationships with each other to crumble. The film is heavily reliant on its main actors, since it almost all takes place in one location, and there are no fancy special effects to distract you from them. There are many clever moments in which a character is acting just slightly off, and while I won't spoil why, there is a very smart explanation for this. While the very end of the film didn't quite make sense to me and felt a bit unnecessary, the rest of the film will keep you guessing about if any of the characters are truly who they say you are, and the sci-fi elements give a genuine sense of unpredictability to each moment.",Coherence

82,dougmacdonaldburr,Interesting,7,25 February 2018,"A bit slow at the beginning, but, I ended up really liking this film. The characters are actually quite bland, but, the premise is so strong that doesn't really matter. Without spoilers it is basically about a group of people at a dinner party during comet. The comet triggers an intersection between parallel universes. If you like science fiction you will be hooked. It was a great film and really cool to think about. I also assume there will be a lot to discover in rewatching it.",Coherence

A few things about it were interesting, but nothing that blew my mind, which is really what I expect from this type of movie if I'm going to rave about. I have to be knocked on my ass and that just didn't happen. The characterizations were good but sometimes flat and pretentious. The scripting was the big issue for me. Not the content, but the pace. It seems for half the movie, everyone is talking at once and/or talking over each other. It was annoying quite honestly. Overall though, it's worth a watch.",Coherence

I saw this movie at the LIFF (Louisiana International Film Festival) a month ago and out of all the Indy movies I've seen, this one is still playing in my head. Now, it wasn't straight up perfect, but it was very good. The cinematography was amateurish but the riveting moments and the genius of the movie more than made up for that. Now, when the plot of the movie was just starting to unfold I pretty much had an idea of what was going to happen and what the movie was about, but that didn't keep me from enjoying the movie, in fact it made me want to see how the writers and director would play the whole thing out, they did a superb job. The actors in this film did their thing as well. Whenever this movie gets to Redbox, Netflix, or however you do your movie rentals, get it. You won't be disappointed.",Coherence
85,Laight,Pretty amazing,9,23 August 2014,"It seems as if all the interesting ideas coming out of Hollywood are either on TV or they're low- budget efforts. This particular movie, made on a very limited budget with no special effects and no big name stars, is a case in point. It's original, fresh, interesting, and those of us who've seen it can discuss it for a long time because unlike most big budget dreck, there's no absolute interpretation to the storyline. As all the reviews point out, the movie is about what happens when a comet passes over earth and somehow creates alternate realities that befuddle eight people at a dinner party. These eight people become the only eight people in their new, multiple realities, and they slowly realize there may be an infinite number of them. The movie slowly builds to a finale that could either mean that the one woman who decides to change to a better reality has either successfully done it, or not -- there are many ways to view the ending - - in fact, you could say there are an infinite number of realities at the end. All in all, a totally enjoyable, well acted small film. (And the bit about Nicholas Brendon's character explaining to one of his friend's friends that he looks familiar because he was an actor on Roswell is mystifyingly satisfying.)",Coherence
86,LiamBlackburn,It's good because it makes you wonder,7,12 August 2014,"It's good because it makes you wonder about that alternate pathway that exists every time you make a decision in life. You take an action and it forever cannot be taken back. The arrow of time shoots forward, the egg breaks and will never be un-broken. It's the law of entropy, everything in the stream of consciousness moves towards a state of disorder. This, paradoxically, means that everything that is further and further into the past, was more and more ordered. Order is just a perception of the observer though....and the observer observes only its reality at any given moment in time. So the observer creates its observation at that moment in time. Each moment passes, never to exist again in the same state, yet collapsed at that moment. All of these moments and realities are happening at once, yet the observer cannot perceive all such realities at once.",Coherence
87,Lucabrasisleeps,Interesting,7,16 May 2015,"I expected a movie that was a little better though. Maybe a movie which would be totally original and would have a terrific ending. I am not so sure I got that. The point is that the basic structure of the movie is something that we have seen in countless other movies and TV shows. Even though clearly time travel and parallel universes are separate concepts, the structure as far as film making is concerned is often almost the same. They deal with the same old ""guy meeting his parallel/past self"" and so on which leads to various problems. The only difference being that there are multiple people who have to deal with this situation now. I was reminded of various Twilight zone episodes (The Parallel, Mirror image in particular), Timecrimes, Primer, Sliding doors and so on. This makes the movie a little predictable since we know how the movie is going to progress. But still there are some neat twists which are interesting.One thing I did like is that they do discuss scientific concepts (in very small doses of course) and incidents. They did leave me thinking even after the movie ended. I like movies which make me curious about the themes and make me want to explore more about them. That is a sure sign that the movie has worked even if it isn't terribly original. So full marks to the filmmakers for that. They don't really dwell on it in depth like say, Primer but then they would be in trouble in losing their audience. I even started reading a little bit about the Tunguska event. It is actually incredibly scary to think that such an event actually even happened.Emily Baldoni is gorgeous but her character always seems creepy and reserved as if she has a secret to hide. You could say it might even be a sort of a red herring. The rest are fine but I have a complaint regarding the character Mike. Is it really necessary that there has to be an idiot in every horror movie? In every horror/thriller movie there is always THAT guy who wants to create problems and acts like an idiot.So what about the ending? I did expect better but still the ending has moved in the only way it can move honestly. It is like poetic justice. You can't let somebody get away so easily for doing something like that. But in another angle, no crime has been committed because such a person never actually existed. At least as far as the current universe is concerned. Maybe that was the evil version and it is necessary for the good version to take down the evil version to make things right. Who knows? In any case, the ending is fine but still maybe I expected a little bit more.Altogether it is not as good as I thought it would be. But I was still entertained by its twists and turns, its scientific discussions and the numerous questions that crop up as the movie goes on. It made me think about the actions of the characters and its consequences. I give it a 7/10",Coherence

89,Sci-FiHorrorFan,This Film is very Clever and thought provoking.,10,10 November 2014,"This is a Mind Bender of a film!.I Have seen the film twice now and it holds up very well. Coherence is a low budget science fiction thriller that I thought had a Great story. The film may start slow and may even be too talky for some people but once the story started I got very engrossed in the film.Coherence is a thinking Film and it requires patience to watch. The acting was good from everyone and I found the story original and intriguing it was something I had never seen before. I don't want to give away too much about the film but I will say strange things begin to happen one night when a group of friends gather together for a dinner party,during the night a comet passes. At the start of the film a few peoples phones crack without explanation which I found creepy,and that's what I like about this film it keeps you thinking as to what is going on.The Viewer is just as confused as the characters are,and you have to solve the mystery.This is definitely a thinking Film,and The film has a good mystery and a very Dark Moody atmosphere and you can really feel the tension of the film.I have to say for a low budget film this was very impressive and interesting. I was entertained by this film from beginning to end and I was constantly wondering what was going on,and when the twist is revealed and I found out what was happening I was very surprised in a good way. Some people have complained about the film and said its too weird,but what do you expect from a science fiction film? Do you expect realism in a film like this?.The film is Not supposed to be realistic that's the whole point.films like this are weird and surreal and mind bending and I'm glad it was like that because that made it more interesting. If people want to see a realistic film then do NOT watch this film,however if your like me and you like films with crazy mind bending stories then you should definitely watch this film. The film has a crazy science fiction story that I loved and there was good character development and I also liked a lot of the characters.the film really sucked me in and I felt like I was part of the story.In my opinion figuring things out is part of the fun.if we knew what was going on right from the start there would be no mystery and no suspense but because I did not know what was happening,that made the film more interesting for me and made it more suspenseful. The story was fascinating and the film made me think carefully about things. Without a doubt Coherence is one of the best science Fiction films I've ever seen and I would watch it again!.Its Definitely recommended for people who like science Fiction films I thought the film was Very good and I Loved It.",Coherence

Both movies make same rough cuts in between scenes, start with a party and have a great way to build up the creepy tension without any action going on. Think, think, think!

Some character drama comes off as unnecessary or forced
Movie looks visually worse in the daytime, the budget becomes much more apparentBest part: Em walking around and looking at a bunch of different universes, definitely something I'll remember when I think about this movie

The cinematography is terrible but that can easily be forgiven due to the low budget. There's some questionable actions from some of the characters in the first half but these actions serve their purpose in the second. The performances have a certain realism to them and the story is so unique, the cheap look and amateur camera work become easier to bare as the film moves forward. There's a hint of Lars von Trier's Melancholia but this film goes in a completely different direction.The less you know the better the experience will be. This is one of the best dramatic thrillers of the last decade and one of the best indie science-fiction films to-date. What the film lacks in it's look it more than makes up for in story.",Coherence

96,chris330r,The concept is great,2,17 January 2021,"This premise would make a really good movie with a big budget and competent actors. Hopefully it gets remade the way it should be because there's so much potential with it.
What bothered me throughout the whole film was why they were all afraid of their other selves? Natural curiosity would have most people going over to the other houses to interact with their other selves and maybe try to figure everything out together.
The budget was probably too small to show that since it would been expensive special effects, but I was hoping at least one of them would be like ""Oh cool, we're all in an alternate reality 2 blocks away. Let's go visit ourselves and party!""Maybe i'm weird, but that's what i'd want to do. And when they did accidentally encounter themselves in the street they scurried away in utter fear of their doppelgangers. With a premise like this, I think the audience WANTS to see how they'd react to each other.And one of them does this at the very end and that's the only time it started getting good....and then it quickly ends. And it not only ended, but it left things hanging like a Friday afternoon soap, only there's no Monday coming to continue where we left off with this!! You can't do that with movies!!

It had an interesting and unexpected twist around the middle of the film with the first two guys who left having been the guys from the other house. One part that really annoyed me was at about 31:21 into the film, when Em is talking and there's a close up, you can see very clearly a strip of make up - foundation I guess - going straight down her nose bridge. It's hilarious and distracting at the same time.Elizabeth Gracen - about 52 yrs old at this time - looked damn good. She looked like she just stepped off The Highlander set. She looked 20 years younger than she is.The end didn't make much sense to me. I thought Em killed...herself, sort of. But then I guess her double is calling that guy at the end? I think the director messed up the end, which sort of ruined the movie in a way.I gave this a 6-star rating because it was very original, and even though it was low-budget, they squeezed out a very good and entertaining movie.

98,MattBirk,Pay Close Attention!!,8,28 January 2015,"'Coherence' is one of those movies that you won't soon forget, whether you hated it or loved it, the movie is something special (especially since it's a directing debut). Rather than being a 'basic' time traveling movie, the movie focuses on the Schrodinger's Cat Paradox (I'm not going to elaborate on the subject for potential spoiler reasons), which is sure to make things far more complicated. I loved how it wasn't your straight forward time travel flair, it was more intricate and original than that, though it isn't till later in the movie that you realize this (which might be too late). And while the second half of the movie features the more complex aspects of the narrative, I have to admit the first third of the movie or so, was a bit of a struggle. None of the characters are particularly interesting, I guess you could call them an 'average family', which is more or less a good thing. But the cardinal sin the movie makes is without question the faulty camera work, it really showed the film was amateurish, not quality wise, but inexperience. They struggle to focus the camera at times (probably on purpose, but why?), the framing was terrible, and of course it was hand-held at times and shaky. Outside of that, Coherence was pretty dang interesting, not many movies tackle these types of narratives and can pull it off. If you are into the whole 'mind bending' experience a la 'Timecrimes', 'Triangle', and 'Primer', this is more than worthy of consideration.www.simplefilmreviews.com",Coherence

This thought-provoking concept leading to so many questions and possibilities keeps me hooked. However, the ending betrays this thought-provoking quality of the movie and you just feel cheated. If the characters are so concerned the whole time about making sure they are with the ""correct"" version of their partner, then why not just call their partner's cell phone and ask them where they are exactly? Does each alternate reality have its own alternate cell tower?

Great Sci-fi,9,26 April 2015,"What starts out as a normal dinner party among long time friends ends up as a mind-blowing, alternative universe flick which is slowly revealed to the audience (and the actors) as the story progresses. I have always enjoyed time travel scenarios where it is possible to influence events by changing one factor or action. And while this is not a time travel movie, it has that feel.The fascinating thing is that the viewer starts figuring out what is going on at the same time as the actors. This movie was shot on an incredibly low budget ($50K) over 5 nights of shooting with one set. The actors had a variety of options as to what they were saying and doing during the movie - no set script, evidently. This gives the movie a reality and freshness that is captivating.I admit, I did not ""get"" a lot of the movie, until I read more about it on blogs, interviews, etc. But I was captivated by it and intrigued throughout. This one will be added to a very short list of movies (Titanic and 30 days of Night, to be exact) where I watched the movie multiple times in a very short period. This is the kind of movie which, I am sure will be better revealed the second (or third time around). So if this Sci-fi, deep thought type of movie is your thing, go for it.

A writer can very well choose the passing of a comet as a source of strange events, but a geek won't resist showing off that he read, and thought he understood, about quantum physics and Schrodinger's cats. A writer would have concentrated on the human story, and left the pseudo-science to our discretion.The second flaw is that the thing is filmed like a US TV sitcom, from the selection of camera to the flow of dialogue and the direction of actors. If you're addicted to TV, you may ignore this comment, but to me Coherence offers the same soulless feeling than the post 1980s programs. I don't believe budget restrictions are a cause for such atmospheric platitude.The movie does get better towards the end, although that's too late. It gets better when a character finally realises what's happening and decides to act. So far, a bunch of idiots were talking and behaving randomly and uninterestingly. Finally, someone gets us interested in finding out her purpose and her personality. The story would have greatly benefited had that understanding been shared early, with more characters fleshing out from there. Less of the so-called mystery and more of the human motives.Small spoiler: The simple fact that none of the (more than) many people involved try to meet their match is an aberration and a missed opportunity.",Coherence

Not a single false note there. It looks like a million bucks. Kudos to the crew.Script-wise however, are things where things go south a little bit. There aren't any 'plot holes' per say, but some plot devices are a bit too ham-fisted in a movie that prides itself in looking 100% real. I felt they probably knew that too, but couldn't re-shoot after the fact.As a whole, the story feels a bit unfinished. That's the issue when you create a situation where the number of problems for your character increases exponentially by the second - there's no real good way to end it I guess, outside a deus-ex-machina.

107,Tanay_LKO,Losing Reality in the Gripping 'Coherence',7,13 January 2017,"A psychedelic, sci-fi, suspense-drama based around the strange events happening as a mysterious comet passes Earth almost qualifies as a natural choice for this 'Friday, the 13th'. It surely sounded simple enough, especially with the backdrop of what started as a pleasant dinner-night amongst a group of friends, twisting into intersecting parallel realities (a.k.a. ""coherence"" in Quantum Physics), with people losing their 'coherent' selves as they walked panic-stricken between those countless universes, each time encountering an unoriginal version of themselves – albeit with not as passive intentions as themselves.By the moment we step into its ACT II amidst getting hold of that literal 'identity-crisis', that unsettling feeling crept into bafflement. Their maddening out-of-place altering accounts pushed the troubled characters and viewers alike while skeptically attempting to keep tabs with notes and paraphernalia about which ""reality"" they exist in especially when dark-secrets of their pasts are unceremoniously revealed. Nothing stayed the same in that astronomical anomaly, and the long wait for that ominous comet and the night to pass continued. However, quite unsurprisingly when the morning arrived, it was hardly a relief to some.Earlier popularised in an episode of the sitcom ""The Big Bang Theory"" – the paradoxical thought-experiment ""Schoredinger's Cat"" proposed that ""a cat trapped within a box with a vile of poison could both be dead and alive, until the box is opened to discover one of the results. Just as in Maths, the possibility of all probabilities co-existing till an event occurs and a result is found.Based on such mind-boggling Physical theories it certainly came as a surprise from the writer of the Oscar-winning animated-comedy feature ""Rango"" - James Ward Byrkit. Though, thankfully the creepiness of such a theme doesn't come along with gore, but instead through a fairly engaging character-based multi- narrative.It was a bit of a lag to be over-indulgent in sub-plots, nevertheless, the film's a solid-catch for those hungry, non-mainstream cinema viewers looking out for a unique plot, and what better than an appreciable attempt to make that innocuous seeming theory into a freaking account of multiple-realities.Rating – 7.5/10.",Coherence

This film is a good example of how a good initial idea fails because of its own internal logic. Some systems only work within themselves, are physically impossible to produce. So it goes with the comparison to Schroedinger's cat, which explicitly becomes the basis of this cinematic experiment of a film. And it quickly becomes clear that what director Byrkit has come up with here cannot work.

Their experiences throughout one evening get stranger and more frightening as time passes, as they discover an alternative version of themselves, and combat reason with paranoia and emotion.What takes awhile to develop is a well designed plot, similar to other movies that make the audience think. Most rewarding here is the affirmation that a low budget film can be great, with a solid script.",Coherence
111,niyantha,Inventive ingenious smart,7,29 December 2020,"""That's weird. It's you calling me.""#coherence is a remarkable, complicated SciFi bizarre which takes place entirely at a suburban dinner party. It' is a proof that inventive filmmakers can do a lot with a little.When you provide a good budget and with the help of great idea people can create wonders?
Absolutely we can see World Full of #nolan #villeneuve but if you haven't got much budget for your idea? Then film's like #timecrimes #coherence will happens. It's An ingenious micro-budget science-fiction nerve-jangler and not only a smart SciFi but Also a testament to the power of smart ideas and strong ensemble acting over expensive visual pyrotechnics.The crazy part was it shot over only five nights in a single location with dialogue that was largely improvised.The story took a year to write to byrkit and he wanted to use his own house as the setting of the movie. The set only had 10 members including cast.There were only two cameras used throughout the filming of the movie except 2 or 3 scenes.Once you started sticking or curious about the movie, it becomes slightly too much like an unfolding mathematical puzzle, although an ingenious one that reaches a chilling conclusion.Director #jameswardbyrkit told an interviewer, ""For about a year, all I did was make charts and maps and drew diagrams of houses, arrows pointing where everyone was going, trying to keep track of different iterations. Months and months of tracking fractured realities, looking up what actual scientists believe about the nature of reality-Schrödinger's cat and all that. It was research, but despite all the graphs and charts, I think our whole idea was that it has to be character-based. We want the logic of our internal rules to be sound, and we wanted it to be something people could watch 12 times and still discover a new layer.The movie cuts to black at 0:02, 0:03, 0:05, 0:05, 0:07, 0:09, 0:19, 0:27, 0:32, 0:34, 1:06, 1:18, 1:22, and 1:23. The movie's director has said those cuts signify something, but hasn't said what they signify. There was no cut to black around 0:16, which was the point of divergence between realities.although the house was plunged into darkness due to an electricity cut. There was no cut to black at 0:17, when the characters all switched from a house without a broken glass to a house with a broken glass, and there was no cut to black at 0:46, when only Mike switched to a different reality.He intensionally wanted to make a film that contains less budget and crew. I come from theater where I was trained to really just concentrate on story and character on a stage with actors and so I was craving getting rid of everything, getting rid of the crew; getting rid of script, no special effects, no support, no money, no nothing, and just getting back to the purity of that, of a camera in your hand and some actress (actors?) that you trust and an idea.""",Coherence

113,MovieSonic,Good but a missed opportunity to be great,7,19 March 2015,"I enjoyed watching this and I highly recommend it to others. In terms of 'weirdness', I would compare Coherence with Triangle (2009), another fantastic time-bending, paradox-type film. I don't mind low budget films because they often surprise you with interesting concepts and thought-provoking scripts which big budget films lack these days. Take Interstellar (2014) for example; an epic film with a huge budget yet its script doesn't come close to being as engaging as Coherence.The story takes place during a dinner party across an evening while a comet passes overhead. We get a bit of foreshadowing when ""Em"" describes some spooky things that happened the last time a comet passed over the Earth so we're given an idea of how interesting things are going to get. This is possibly to avoid people getting bored as for the first 20 minutes or so, we are essentially just watching a regular dinner party that any one of us could have attended. This includes bits of interesting conversations and some nice cut aways and then finally, just as things start to meander, the weirdness begins.There were only two plot developments that I didn't like (plus the ending). The first one happened fairly early on in the film: I didn't like the justification given for leaving the house. It was never explained, it didn't make sense and was never mentioned again or used later in the film i.e. it was just a throw-away, convenient plot point but it was quite a small development so it didn't affect my enjoyment; it was just a bit lazy. The second would potentially be a spoiler so I have to be vague: The film meandered a bit too much before the next twist kicked in and I would have preferred that it happened much sooner and that everybody came to the same conclusion about what needed to be done. That would have created a much more interesting third act and would have generated larger audience investment in the characters, as we'd be interested in seeing who would make it and who wouldn't. Related to this, I didn't understand why Em ultimately made the decision that she did. What prompted this? I can think of something she could have overheard that would have motivated her (related to being a ballerina), but as it stands, unless I missed something, her decision was quite random and could have put her in a worse situation than before.Finally, I did not like the ending at all. The film had done a good job up until then of not becoming convoluted but suddenly, events became a bit messy and I did not like the very final scene. I don't understand how it is possible for a film to have a bad ending. Did the story writers not show their work to anyone? I can think of a handful of better endings just off the top of my head. Luckily the ending happens very quickly, so you don't really have time to be annoyed by it or let it ruin the overall experience so although I usually don't recommend films with bad endings, I can still recommend Coherence based on its overall merits.Those are my main gripes with the film. I thought that with a few tweaks this could have been really great but as the film is extremely enjoyable, I want to end on a positive note: I loved the ideas presented, the originality and the fact that we're watching normal people doing normal things as opposed to perfectly preened and never-ageing film stars. It's always more interesting to watch. I absolutely loved ""Mike's"" reaction to the situation (that would definitely be me because I've seen far too many films!) and everybody's acting was great. Much like Time Lapse (2014), Coherence gets more and more interesting with every scene which is another bonus.I think everybody involved should be very proud. I hovered between 6 and 7 because overall, the film easily deserves a 7 but the ending really did let it down. I'd give it 6.7 if I could so I've rounded up to 7/10.",Coherence

Indeed, if there is someone like me (parallel universe and physics enthusiast) just try it without waiting for much. Because sometimes the high expectation changes the perspective of the film. But if it coincides with the right audience, it is considered a great movie.It is as if the events are really happening and you are there. They reflected the movie beautifully.

Giving away the ending would be an actual spoiler and I will not do that.They reveal the borderline spoiler halfway into the movie and make a big deal out of it. But until that point, I found the characters irritating. Afterward their previous actions made sense and I enjoyed re-watching the movie to look for the clues that I missed the first time. Anyway you have been warned ....This has the same premise as 'Parallel 2018' which I liked better but they are quite different. In Parallel, they figure out the multiverse angle in the first 10 minutes and then they develop how those characters change by exploring it. Parallel was a negative version of 'Groundhog Day'.This movie spends most of its time showing the confusion inflicted on this circle of friends as different subsets of them get mixed up together. This was a clever idea. There are some things I did not like but will keep to myself because that would detract from viewing the movie for yourself.I can see how people could prefer either Coherence or Parallel over the other but both are good.",Coherence

I watched it knowing nothing about it, just that I was in the mood for a thriller movie and I happened to stumble across it on Amazon Video. This is certainly a movie where I'm glad I had no idea what the premise would be. From the trailer, it just looked like a bunch of people going crazy, but I'm glad it was way more creative than that.I'm impressed it was shot in an apparently improvised style, with very natural sounding dialogue, like it's just a bunch of real people talking, with a natural flow to the conversation, instead of reading lines that had been written for them. It certainly makes the characters feel real. There's even people trying to be funny by inserting lame improvised jokes into the conversation, just like in real life. These actors certainly deserve bigger roles, for sure, in particular the lead actress Emily Foxler (or Emily Baldoni, as she's now credited).And as a side note, this movie is proof that it's entirely possible to make a very good movie for a relatively very small budget, shot almost entirely in someone's house. I see so many critics bragging like they'd be so good at making movies, like they know all the tricks to movie making, yet they're never willing to actually prove that they make any movies, despite having the nerve to act like experts on how to do it.

Also, the ending is pretty great but the build up to it with Em and Em was pretty dumb not gonna lie.I have so much respect for everyone that likes this movie that I sat through these terrible people portrayed by very terrible actors and the headache they gave me because the story was pretty compelling.I would love to see the director remake this with capable actors and equipment.",Coherence
130,ConsistentlyFalconer,Brains Beats Budget - excellent micro-budget thriller.,8,24 July 2015,"Coherence (2013)Micro-budget, sci-fi, edge-of-the-seat head-scratcher.Micro-budget films are nothing new, but have had something of a resurgence and are now numerous enough to be noted as a proper movement. There are micro-budget horrors, sci-fi films, dramas, comedies... and where the budget issue usually shows, for me, is in the acting. A lot of these films will have great ideas, decent scripts, and with the sort of technology available to anybody with a laptop the production values are usually pretty damn impressive. But if you can't afford to pay decent actors, you've got a problem. Of course, you know you're watching a micro-budget film, so you let it go. That said, there are a few that really get everything right, and this is one of them.Believable ""everyman"" performances from the whole cast; a really interesting and well- devised plot... some great twists and turns, and it always keeps you guessing. The final couple of scenes are a particularly nice touch. The only problem I had was that two of the male characters look quite similar, and I'm hopeless with keeping track of who's who anyway, so did have to pause about ten minutes in and consult Wikipedia! You should have seen me trying to deal with Gosford Park, for goodness' sake...Anyway, yeah - check it out. Nifty little thriller. I read an interview with the filmmakers that mentioned they were not so much inspired by that other micro-budget sensation Primer as they were by films like Carnage (2011, Roman Polanski), and that definitely shows. In terms of character development and atmosphere, it felt to me more like a cross between Carnage and the superb Spanish thriller (with an awful title) Timecrimes (2007), or Triangle (2009), which are all definitely worth your time.

Characters were descent, most of them acted like people would in extraordinary situation that happens in the movie (with few instances where I thought it went into overacting territory). Confused, dazed and paranoid, yet characters always seem to find a way to keep things going.Camera work is the movie's biggest problem. I am not sure if it's a trend for new filmmakers, but why they keep using dancing stadycam when movie clearly doesn't need one. It should have been shot as traditional movie. I've seen this in lot of new movies. It kinda adds to intimacy of the movie, but it felt distracting. Still camera didn't go berserk like in most stadycam movies, at least they tried to keep it ""tame"".If you're not easily bothered by ""dancing"" camera, then this movie might be for you.

141,davejones,"Inventive, Suspenseful Film spoiled by Baffling Character Behavior",6,7 April 2016,"There's a lot to like about Coherence. It has an original premise. It's well acted and the dialogue has a nice naturalistic feel.Unfortunately, the conflict and paranoid atmosphere felt forced to me. It's all well and good to have one character, Mike, who has a drinking problem and such hostility toward himself that he assumes that his Doppelganger will try to kill him. But why are all the other characters in this film so paranoid and on edge from the beginning? They're a bunch of self-absorbed yuppies, not escaped murderers from a maximum-security prison.You're at a dinner party, there's a power outage so the lights go out, and then there's a knock at the door so. . . you startle as if they threw a rock through your window? And then grab a baseball bat before answering? This seems odd, especially when two members of your party have just left to go investigate the house up the street with the intention of asking to use the phone. If it were me, I'd just assume that someone was probably coming to my door to ask the very same thing.And once these characters figure out that reality has fractured and that there are duplicates of themselves from another reality running around--I still don't understand what they're so afraid of. I mean, obviously that would be a freaky and unsettling situation. But once your doppelganger has demonstrated, by leaving exactly the same note that you wrote on your front door, that he behaves exactly as you do, wouldn't you at least be somewhat curious to meet him or her? Most of these characters seemed reasonably intelligent and rational. Why should they be so automatically fearful of these alternative selves--even after they've accidentally spent time with them and found them to be benign. I think the writer needed a stronger trigger for all the fear and hostility.And as several commenters here have mentioned, the camera work is bad. I understand that hand-held is used to add energy and tension to a scene, but there's no excuse for things like that interminable opening shot in which no part of the frame is in focus.

142,jcbinok,A Breath of Fresh Air,8,23 April 2016,"It was nice to watch a movie with adult actors and no guns.

After accepting the premise, it was fun to watch the excellent actors slowly progress deeper and deeper toward raw emotion.The length of the movie easily could have been extended to allow for more clarity (or attempts at clarity). Once the viewer loses confidence in whether the characters they're watching are the original ones they started the movie with, it all starts to get jumbled. As with similar sci-fi flicks (like Another Earth), the premise itself is the star, but an ending is difficult to pull off. Like in Another Earth, Coherence opts for the open ending. Can't say I blame the writers. I will fault them for drawing out the ending a little too long, though: ""Original/blue team"" Em finds a reality that looks agreeable to her, so she kills that reality's Em. OK, I understand so far. But, then the next morning, that other Em (corpse) is gone from the bathtub. Where did she go? Was she not really killed? Em's boyfriend gets a call from one Em while he's looking at ""Original/blue team"" Em. Confusing.

I was wondering while watching it- does the writer/director need to draw up diagrams in order to assemble the plot and achieve the right balance between order and disorder?

149,Marthian80,Good mystery movie with some tense moments,7,10 April 2017,"Coherence is a movie about eight friends who haven't seen each other for a while and finally getting together for a diner. On the night of the diner, disturbing things start happening like cellphones not working and power failing. Some of the friends think it is all related to a comet that passes close to earth that night, but how far does the comet effects go?I went to see this movie without knowing anything about it. The movie start's slow, with a bunch of thirty-something people getting together and talking about relationships. But soon weird things start happening to these people and it gets weirder as more information is revealed. They keep a good pace and it's easy to follow the story as long as you keep paying attention. It's great to see how much can be achieved with just eight actors, a house and hardly any special effects. As long as you have a descent script and talented people, good films can be made without huge budgets. That said, there were a few moments in the movie that were a bit dull though and I wished they focused more on the thriller aspect. The characters are going through some very weird stuff and some of them stay a bit to calm. The ending is very good though and could keep you pondering for a bit about what happened. So do check this movie out if you like mysterious movies with a light touch of Science Fiction thrown in.",Coherence

The atmosphere generated in the film is excellent and the story is carried forward almost immaculately. Despite this the film screams low-budget on two points that make it fall short of its aspirations.My complaints with the film start from the camera-work. It is horrendous. If you had handed me a camera I would have done a better job. Throughout the runtime of this movie the camera loses focus of the subject and jitters about every now and then. This effectively ruins the impact of a scene. I'd go on to say that the camera-work is way below amateurish even. Its like the whole film is shot with a DSLR on autofocus.Another problem with this movie is the editing, specifically at the start, where the scenes are cut without any sort of continuity. One moment the group is discussing something else then there is a black-screen for a couple of seconds and the topic of discussion is completely different.All in all, it is a genuinely creative story let down by amateur photography and editing.",Coherence

It always come to an amusing and puzzling mind game, 'cause in practically (and simply) put infinite number of realities (i.e. multiverse) everything is possible and is happening. AND when somebody (like Schrödinger with a cat in a box) shows a theoretical experiment where they (quantum and macro realities) are connected in given setup, it becomes lovingly amusing. This movie does exactly so. And personally reminds me of my friends' Prof Dr Milan Cirkovic's papers with ""funny"" titles like: ""Is Quantum Suicide Painless? (On an apparent violation of Principal principle)"", ""The Anthropic Argument Against Cosmologies With Infinite Past"" and others alike!I hope that even an outsider/layman can get this.

155,anthony-burton4,An extremely interesting if somewhat contrived movie,8,10 January 2020,"If you like SciFi that makes you think then this is really worth a watch.The basic idea is VERY interesting and I like the pace at which they present it. There's some reasonable performances and the characters for the most part are very believable. I understand the film was mostly improvised which makes it all the more remarkable, although it also explains some of the short-comings.I'm not sure you can fully grasp this movie in a single viewing - as it progresses your understanding of what it going on increases - your brain will probably head down multiple cul-de-sacs, right up to and perhaps including the end. However, all of the stuff that you were paying attention to towards the end, was actually happening from the very beginning of the movie. Is ANYTHING, including the ending what it seems? Enough unanswered questions are left in the viewers mind to leave you uncertain as to whether the discrepancy is a flaw in the movie, or whether your understanding is lacking something! This means it's brilliant for post-movie discussion!My first thought after watching the movie was that there were too many unbelievable situations - the behaviour of the characters didn't really stack up at times, but I now see that THAT is taken care of with one explanation of events.I'll leave you with the thought that in a multiverse, every POSSIBLE scenario is accounted for - that includes a great number of highly unlikely scenarios. Like tossing a coin, there's a very low but finite possibility that it may land on its edge. It's possible in a multiverse, that one reality exists in which I manage that 8 times on the trot. You won't understand why I've written this until after you've watched the movie at least once, but then hopefully it may shed light on a few things - in particular the ""extreme"" behaviour of some of the characters.",Coherence

158,tokanac,An incoherent movie,2,21 September 2019,"I found this title on Netflix's 'trending now' list and, upon finding that it had Nicholas Brendon (Buffy's Xander) in it, I was willing to give it a go. As I started to view it, I looked it up on IMDB, and was surprised to see it have such a high rating with a lot of great reviews; it, to me, didn't match what I was seeing. I didn't go in with such high hopes, but I did hope that it would be better than it was. I would call this worse than a B-grade movie! I have never seen James Ward Byrkit's other movies, but I sure do hope that they're much better than this one!The premise had promise, but the acting, script, directing and camera work let it down significantly. The acting was wooden, the script was weak and didn't allow these actors to shine, the directing didn't do it any justice and the camera work was shocking - the camera operators just couldn't keep the camera still and focused on irrelevant objects, leaving the important or interesting elements out of focus. The camera was out of focus and then slowly focused on a glass that one character had put down to dry. What was the purpose of this? This style is usually done when revealing something new and surprising to the audience. What was the reveal? We had seen the character washing the glass before setting it down to dry.The camera work can work if done well, especially if it's a POV shot, and it can add to the tension arising in the story, but it just didn't work here.Some other things that didn't make sense:
If, after some of the guys left to check out the house up the road, why would the other characters be scared and grab a baseball bat with which to protect themselves when they hear a knock on the door? Wouldn't it be logical that it'd be their friends returning?Why would one of the characters go to the other house, drug her alternate self and then knock her out with the toilet bowl cover? That doesn't make sense.All in all, I give it 2/10 stars, as this movie was all over the place, not making sense and leaving the audience confused, therefore rendering it incoherent. Maybe that's why James Ward Byrkit named it 'Incoherent', as it's just that.",Coherence

The story tries to remain centered around the hot suburban blonde, who soon discovers that things are creepier than everyone realizes. If you can survive this maze of nonsense and annoying, shallow suburban characters long enough to make it to the end, the creep factor is substantial enough to be worth the effort. At the very least, the brief shots of the comet are sort of breathtaking.

I did not like that the characters were all just a little too accepting of the situation. I did not like that some reactions and/or emotions conveyed were inappropriate for some situations (laughing over pictures in the thick of it all?! come on!)

164,azcoppen,Attempting to be too clever for its own good.,6,5 January 2015,"You have to praise the balls of anyone who wants to try and explain quantum mechanics via dialogue and/or objects, particularly over a dinner party of mediocre middle-class LA denizens that specifically uses dialogue designed to sound ""ordinary"". It immediately reminds you of ""The Man From Earth"" - a fine, excellent film - with the only difference being that the latter has the wisdom of deliberately leaving it ambiguous as to whether the whole thing is an elaborate yarn. There's an old saying that if you think you understand Quantum physics, you don't; nobody does. But most importantly, artistically, nobody cares - it's an entirely theoretical game that's not emotionally affective to the human experience.The sad thing is the film is so interested in explaining the physics that it neglects the whole idea of a film: to tell a story. There is no real story or plot going on here at all, other than a group of people freaking out that there are lots of copies of them around and nobody knows which copy they are (aside from a later jealousy subplot). That's an interesting idea, but it's not a story.The first thing to bear in mind is that Schrodinger was trying to point out that larger objects could not possibly exist in simultaneous states; the cat is alive or dead, and the whole thing is arguably absurd. The writer has taken the opposite of the point, i.e. what seems like a cool idea (a perpetual quantum superposition triggered by a comet - wtf?) and extended it into metaphysics - minus any of the interesting human stuff. I would suspect this is a branch of quantum ""mysticism"" at worst. The problem is quantum phenomena occurs in an entirely different context, and extrapolating it onto the larger world is next to impossible, unless you're misguidedly hoping to co-opt it like a lame ""higher consciousness"" trope in true brainless Angeleno style.The truly interesting stuff isn't the cleverness of the idea itself (and explaining it), but our reaction to it - the most curious parts are Em's: she suggests they have a unique opportunity to interrogate a copy of themselves in real life; later, she murders her own copy. These are the fascinating questions: what happens to us *humanly* when there are 8 different versions with differing timelines and outcomes? Humans being humans, we're going to start doing some very disturbing and illogical things, which play out crazily on the screen - IF you can get the premise set up properly at the beginning, and not use the whole film to elaborate, springboard, and explain the premise itself. There are some fantastically dark scenarios to be explored in the ""many worlds"" core concept: what if one of the characters went on a spree to murder all their copies? What about a narcissist who fell in love or made love to/with themselves? What would the copies say to each other as ""therapy"", and what would the consequences to them be? What would they force each other to do in front of each other if they know they could use another version of themselves to do the things they couldn't/wouldn't? Could they use their weaknesses against themselves?At that point, who gives a damn which glowsticks they use, what the textbook said, or whether there are 2,3, or 15 competing realities? If the writing weren't so infatuated with its own smartness, a trip down those rabbit holes would make it an unstoppable cinematic force.There is, of course, the problem with the camera-work: it's tough to watch. The hand-held stuff isn't done too elegantly, and at some points is more like frantic tremors than exciting unease. The low-budget means the outside lighting is potentially too dark to see what's happening.All in all, it's a cracking idea to strip things down and do something interesting on the metaphysical level with science, on a cheap budget - aiming in the right direction to make film smarter for an audience that doesn't need hand-holding. The trouble is always balance: don't be too involved in being smart to forget what makes us human in the first place; our depravity.",Coherence
165,screenotes,Watered down ketamine is not a social lubricant,7,20 September 2019,"Between the years 2011 and 2013, an astral phenomenon occurred which caused several different Screenwriters to have the same idea. The product of that idea was the following films:Melancholia (2011) - Two sisters find their already strained relationship challenged as a mysterious new planet threatens to collide with Earth.Another Earth (2011) - On the night of the discovery of a duplicate Earth in the Solar system, an ambitious young student and an accomplished composer cross paths in a tragic accident.Coherence (2013) - Strange things begin to happen when a group of friends gather for a dinner party on an evening when a comet is passing overhead.This phenomena was the reason I had never seen Another Earth nor Coherence, for though I am an avid consumer of science fiction, I remain a staunch sceptic when it comes to both astrology and appropriation. I was destined to see Lars Von Trier's Melancholia at the approximate time of its release but based on a hunch I assumed the other efforts would be derivative.Though I am yet to see indy darling Brit Marling's Another Earth, I recently caught no-one-in-particular's Coherence*. And lo, I am ashamed to admit I was a fool to make the assumption that this film would be derivative. In fact far from being so, Coherence is original in both idea and execution.A science fiction film which leans into its zero-budget** milieu through naturalistic dialogue and hand held cinematography, the true genius of Coherence crept up on me well into and long after its 90 minute runtime. It's a thought experiment which essentially asks, what would you do if you came across multiple versions of yourself?It's not a perfect film, at least not on first viewing. There are seemingly needless references to unrelated thought experiments which arise as the film's cast of dinner party guests attempt to understand their predicament***. And yet I am of the suspicion that the film's seemingly glaring plot holes are little more than challenges to the viewer to watch it all again.Whether or not one does attempt a repeat viewing, Coherence is well worth its 90 minute**** runtime. An enjoyable ride and a definite conversation starter***** over a post-watch beverage******.Though the jury's still out on Astrology, I now hold out hope that there are parallel universes, alternate timelines and realities in which I were not so closed-minded as to have missed out on an enriching experience.
*James Ward Byrkit may be a household name in an alternate reality**The budget was actually $50,000 which is one fiftieth the budget of Time Crimes (2007), one hundredth the budget of Moon (2009) and seven times the budget of Primer (2004) - though Shane Carruth's film itself should have an asterisk beside it as Shane Carruth is not of this world

179,cmantafounis,Coherence,9,22 September 2021,"Second watch, and *wow*. Can easily say this would be among my favourite films released in 2013, making it the fourth sci-fi movie in the top five (alongside Her, Under the Skin, and Upstream Colour - the exception being Inside Llewyn Davis). Its greatest trick is fooling the audience into believing that there are only two houses for at least an hour, until Hugh shows up with a different plaster and we realise all previous assumptions made were false. (At around 45 minutes, the first hint is made when Beth asks Lee where she got the vase in the kitchen from, seemingly for the second time that night - Emily's reaction shows she picks up on this, formulating the ""roulette wheel"" theory.) As such, the Schrödinger explanation felt less pandering and expository this time around, once you realise that the proposition is wrong (or, at least, not all-encompassing): the decoherence has not resulted in just two states, dead or alive, but a whole multiverse of infinite possibilities. Like the attempt to explain the events as a drug-induced mass hallucination, this is just a theory - which is what makes this so entertaining on first watch, as we are more or less on the same level of understanding as the characters throughout; on subsequent viewings, these theories can be dismissed and one can instead marvel at the ingenuity of the script, which allows three or four different versions of our protagonists to be on screen before we even realise there are any more than two.Primarily a parable of choice: the multitude of possible outcomes in life is paramount to the story, as we try to distinguish the different realities by whether Hugh has a ""regular band-aid"" or a cloth one, if the glowsticks are red, blue, or green; which of those three colours the marker is, what die roll each person got, whether the glass we later see being cleaned is cracked or not, whether Hugh's phone screen is likewise broken or not, whether the supposedly unique box contains a ping pong paddle, oven mitt, coaster, stapler, napkin, or monkey; et cetera. These countless decisions and random chances which we face in life make lasting impacts upon us - in one reality, Kevin is a caring boyfriend who gets sentimental when shown Em's ring; in another, he has no reaction to seeing it and cheats on her with Laurie. (In another, he is still together with Laurie, and Emily appears to be the subject of discussion as the ""crazy one"".) Mike is a fully recovered alcoholic in the first instance we see him, but later is far more erratic and drinks heavily.Above all, the thesis of the film is that these choices are final and cannot be overturned - Emily, our hero (being the one character who we follow without changing into a slightly altered-reality version of his/herself), can never go back and accept the understudy role, or undo her hesitation at joining Kevin in Vietnam, even after window shopping for seemingly the perfect outcome; the key takeaway from the ambiguous conclusion is that Em does not get away with her attempted reset, that no matter how hard she tries, choices are irreversible. That ending is the only part I still struggle to make sense of, and this is intentional - the alt-Emily disappearing from the bathtub calls back her earlier story about the comet over Finland, where the evidence of a murder completely disappeared. But the ring doesn't vanish, and some other Emily calls Kevin, meaning coherence has not been wholly achieved. Again, a purposeful decision on the director's part to leave out a definitive answer, which I can accept as probably the right move.Incredible to read that the dialogue is almost entirely improvised, as all the interactions feel so natural, and often quite funny: ""We have wine, cheese, ketamine."" ""Thanks, coach."" ""If there are a million different realities, I have slept with your wife in every one of them."" (This last one is another example of a character assuming something later implied to be false; in the final house, mention of Emily's understudy suggests her dancing career was a success in this reality, meaning that pre-comet events can also be different in separate dimensions. This may explain why, in the first house, Mike hadn't heard of Laurie, and Laurie didn't recognise Mike, despite claiming to be a fan of the show he supposedly starred in - everyone may have entered the ""dark zone"" when driving to the venue, resulting in separate realities from the very start.) Beyond the sci-fi and drama working simultaneously, there is a definite horror element too. The loud knock genuinely made me jump the first time I saw this, and the moment where they meet the doppelgängers is chilling. The existential finale rivals most psychological-horrors out there.Obviously not without its flaws, many of which come with the ultra-low-budget territory: a couple instances of distracting ADR (especially Lee saying ""Can we keep two guys here"" around 30 minutes in), some mediocre camerawork which took me out of the experience for a few seconds, and the actor playing Laurie is occasionally not up to the standard of the others. My main issue is the music, which is too leaned upon to create tension when the strength of the material would carry it alone - the loudness of the score (when e.g. The group run away from their doubles, or when Em is hiding the body in the bathroom) feels counterproductive to what is already exciting action without the forced intensity. Not to mention it often sounds like a stock track; while I can now say for certain that I prefer this over (the borderline-masterpiece) Primer, it excites me just to think of how amazing Coherence would be with the composing talents of Shane Carruth. Latter is superior to the former though, both due to its emotional weight and unexpected accessibility - even when we aren't sure what exactly is happening, the film is easy to follow, as the characters are all uncertain too (cf. Carruth's film, where the viewer is always behind the protagonists and trying to piece together an exceedingly complex puzzle); this is what made me (falsely) assume that I had understood it just fine the first go around, and I'm sure that when I watch it again I'll realise how much I missed this time. Just a brilliant idea executed almost perfectly, and somehow so tight, with a runtime under 90 minutes. I love this movie.",Coherence

181,Vlad_the_Reviewer,"Interesting Project, Rare Mindbending Flick, Full of Flaws Though",5,3 January 2015,"A group of friends hang out at home. A comet flies by and causes a parallel universe portal. They split up, turning this movie into a who-is-who flick. Because when, say, Hugh leaves, then if a Hugh returns, it's a person from a different reality. The charm of the movie, and its intention, is that the viewer should observe details to notice changes.The movie was shot in five evenings and one day on a beer budget. It showed. The movie was absolutely riddled with continuity errors. I'm going to make a big deal out of it, but only because of interviews with the director: he said that there were a hundred of small changes to indicate a new reality. So, as he said, it could be interesting to watch the movie six times, or even more. I did, because I'm a fanatic, but so many stuff is out-of-place, one may not know whether it's on purpose or accidental.The acting was not good. They had to improvise, I get it. But Emily Baldoni, our main character is quite bland throughout to the point that it bothered me. Nicholas Brendon did a decent job. The rest of the cast acted mediocre at best. They were all couples but no chemistry at all.The music was an original score and it was quite good actually. Often it stayed on the very background - don't worry, that's way it should be for this movie, and when it was noticeable it was really good and needed. The lighting was mediocre. The shadows, the contrasts, it all was a bit off.The character development wasn't bad at all I must say. None were convincing, but that's because the acting wasn't optimal. Yet I felt I had enough material to connect with anyone if I chose to do so.A section about continuity errors deserves an encyclopedia. Let's not go there.Now let's talk logical errors. There are quite a few and that's very important as logic and deduction is key for this movie. We get the gist though, but if you are good at logic for some reason, you're going to notice a lot of errors. I mean a lot. I won't say the details though. Watch it. If you don't notice then that's fine too.So I rated the movie a 5/10. The mediocre acting (and bland Emily) didn't set me off, though it did bother me now and then. Because the rarity of mind-bending movies and the low budget I'm willing to overlook a lot. And the good original sound deserves a plus for sure. I'm also willing to overlook the mediocre lighting, even though visual cues are very important in this movie. But then again, the satisfactory character development was a plus. Nor did the armada of continuity errors set me off.What did set me off heavily were the logical and deduction errors. Even at the end, where things accumulated, the main logic they were using (Emily, she's the smart one) was seriously flawed. Hence the 5/10. Should you watch it? Sure, if you like mind-bending stuff. If you can stand shaky-cam and extreme low budget movies. It's not for everyone, that's for sure.",Coherence
182,Vikingbyheart,It's a real gem!,9,1 July 2016,"There is an expression in English that is often used to describe people or situations out of the ordinary: ""it's a real gem"". This is exactly how we classify the movie Coherence. But not for its millionaire budget, on the contrary, with an extremely limited budget it develops a complex and challenging narrative that can overshadow several blockbusters. Science fiction from the director James Ward Byrkit, with suspense and terror pinches, the film features four couples, Emily and Kevin (Emily Baldoni and Maury Sterling), Beth and Hugh (Elizabeth Gracen and Hugo Armstrong), Lee and Mike (Lorena Scafaria and Nicholas Brendon) and Laurie and Amir (Lauren Maher and Alex Manugian) that come together to make a dinner party at the home of one of them. The same night, a comet called Miller passes very close to Earth. Strange events are triggered, such as cellphones breaking, blackouts and people acting differently from how they usually do, turning the quiet dinner on a busy night of curious events.The director (Byrkit) did a superb job since the film was recorded in just five nights, practically in one set (a house). The actors did not know what was going to be made​​, which contributed greatly to the suspense of the film. To them were given the characters and reported some personality traits and mood for the day of recording, then putting the triggers for what would pass and shooting what resulted. Here we must also highlight the cast. Although the movie does not have any known name, the actors do not disappoint and deliver excellent performances. The 8 characters have their importance well shared, with Emily (Emily Baldoni) being the protagonist.The screenplay, also written by Byrkit, is bright and complex, exploiting to the full all its nuances. Developed with intelligence, everything that appears throughout the film is no accident: speeches, contextualization and objects. The smallest of details provides information that changes the understanding of the movie. Thus, the characters are part of a puzzle, making us constantly think about how each of its parts fits into the overall context of the film. Even the theory of Schrödinger's cat (a paradox of quantum physics) was used to make the film even more exciting. To make everything clear to the viewer, the characters themselves make notes to establish some things, being the protagonist a key part in monitoring and understanding the facts.The photography, although simple, is so effective that makes it darker and more intimate. Filmed entirely with a hand-held camera and with some dark scenes, little can be seen in some scenes. These moments of pure darkness do not interfere at all at the understanding of the movie, but convey the right amount of tension and suspense to the viewer. The soundtrack complements the dark and suspenseful environment desired by the director. Alternating between quieter moments, with a discreet pace, and others more agitated, conveying a more frantic or dark beat.Coherence is a movie full of twists that will leave you thinking about its many possibilities. Some people may want to watch it again, not only to understand it better, but mainly to capture several details that go unnoticed.Originally posted in: http://vikingbyheart.blogspot.com.br",Coherence

Don't overcompensate for your budget. A movie like this is ALL about confidence. This movie was a long episode of; The Monsters Are Due on Maple Street...but not done as well.

Do your homework Mr Film-maker...if you're going to copy the 50 year old idea, make it MUCH better. The acting was good, but the idea needed more depth over improv dialogue. Too much rambling like a modern 30-Something episode which is OK for TV on cable.Imagine how different this would be if it was set in the south with truckers or farmers? This is too cliché for the yuppie crowd that has never mowed his lawn and lives in the business world, left helpless without a gardener, auto mechanic, or accountant.Overall, boring movie and wonder what the director and writer and producer were thinking.

189,sepial,"Great story, mostly wasted",5,17 September 2014,"This is a spoiler-containing review, as it is near impossible to write anything about the film without giving something away, which in itself is remarkable enough, so this would be one for those who've already watched it. 'Coherence' is a story about very, very stupid people made film by a director who loses against his ambitions. To get my main annoyance out of the way, the choice of how to narrate a series of unwise decisions on behalf of the protagonists is unwise, and displays a preference of form of narration over narrative deciding on form, which can easily slide into pretension, and here does. Hand-held camera and smart editing are tools, a tool is there for something specific and thus does not come first. The editing here is done almost ferociously in order to serve a trend rather than the film, a hip semi-documentary style that isn't warranted by story nor setting, begins to cause exhaling after the first 5 minutes and ultimately stands in the way of letting us take part in the tension. It is done to abundance, it has been done to abundance, and this decisive idea lets a film stand where it's appropriate, fall where it becomes a nuisance. Likewise is the idea to introduce a safe-fail tool of explanation into the midst of the ongoings a bad one. I can easily suspend my belief where it comes to the overall cause of oddness, a comet passing and apparently resulting into a suspension of possibilities, and I'd rather be left with it. I'd rather be left speculating instead of being fed further suggestions along with the characters by means of a book about precisely what's going on that has been conveniently left in the car. But the filmmakers don't trust the audience getting it without it, because they don't trust their characters to get it without help. Not that I would blame them there. A table round of academics, startled from an initializing bang on the door to the extend of giving up their mental capacities, not merely making a few wrong decisions but invariably wrong decisions, had to be sought and was found. Worse, they're also an impressively un-curious bunch. I agree, the more likely scenario of a group of people discovering that this other house and its human contents is another possibility version of their own situation before collapsing into a reality, a group that would upon such a discovery go 'Wow! Let's go over and meet ourselves!' would result into an altogether different story, to give the How-Quickly-Will-It-Crumble-aspect of the small representative society a miss. But that specific possibility lingers about in one's mind. 'We can't trust those others.' And one would like to know why this has become such a premise. To be fair, besides the unnecessary effort of making the protagonists characters by flawing them into stupidity, the eventually transpiring mingling of members of the groups of same selves and the choices resulting make all the sense I'd want and provide thrilling thought- fodder. Disturbing, again, the prescribed actions of these characters, in detail (while they're tied in angst and horror they're still reliably indulging in comparably petty personal problems, or rest in nostalgia) as on the whole (quick resolution to violence, even murder, and blackmailing) – not once does this well-educated group grasp the opportunity. How fantastic and awesome the situation is, how much is revealed about Nature. And in all their over-reacting and discontent not even the fear of this event, the uncertainty of the outcome, the possibility of permanent entrapment comes over convincingly: it all, all of it, remains in the absolute private and frankly egoistic. I openly admit that part of my grudge results from the subject-matter at hand being one I'd always love to be put into a script, the more I'm being fussy and critical when the opportunity is botched. It is precisely the sort of science fiction I care for most. The story itself is brilliant, and I was, after all, entertained by it in the best way, meaning up there. The means of narration and deciding on privileged idiots spoiled it for me, though. All the stars I'm giving are for the story, the acting was good, and in the end I was entertained.",Coherence
190,WildWombatt,Interesting Sci-Fi Movie,7,26 September 2014,"When I first heard of this movie, I was quite excited to see it because of its plot and some recommendations from my family members who have already seen it. Of course, before watching any movie, I checked out the trailer only to find myself disappointed on the way the movie was filmed. I watched it anyway to give it a try, and I would have to say I am surprised how good this movie turned out. If you enjoy Sci-fi movies, or are interested in thrillers and mysteries, I would really recommend.This movie is not confusing as some people say it is, but it could be a bit hard to follow if you're not paying attention. The plot and idea of this film was entertaining; my only complaint is that I dislike the way this movie was filmed (it's shaky and moves around a lot - check out the trailer to see what I mean). If you are okay with ""found-footage"" films, this movie will be no problem for you- however, this is NOT a found-footage-type film.

191,JamesHunt18,Metaphysically Captivating,9,21 July 2020,"A film is generally best enjoyed when going in blind. Such a statement is especially true for Coherence. An ""Intelligent Indie Sci-fi"" is all I knew about this film upon viewing, as well as it definitely being worth watching. And that is exactly what it is, but way way more than that.Being an indie film it certainly has some disadvantages but never have I seen them being used to their advantage so well. The lower budget (~50,000 USD) means the scale is certainly minimal compared to more modern blockbusters. This film does not need to rely on large sfx as the single set helps the thought provoking mission of the plot. The noticeably 'sketchy' camerawork is often brought up a flaw but here it gives the audience a more point of view screening which in turn amplifies the suspense and causes your bones to shake. The horror elements don't need extravagant visuals as it utilises implications and the unknown to make the characters, alongside the viewers, uneasy and paranoid. Furthermore, it's a compact 90-mins which is always good.For a relatively unknown cast most of them certainly hold their own. Emily Baldoni is unquestionable in what is closest to the lead. Supporting actors Maury Sterling and Nicholas Brendon also fulfil their respective roles very well.Despite the rating, this movie is not perfect. Some of supportive acting isn't great and it's noticeable. The science is on and off but the film gives you what you need to know especially as many viewers, even the filmmakers, will be ill-equipped to deal with actual science, especially as the premise itself doesn't exactly align with astrophysics. I eventually did lean into this rating due to what it achieved considering the facts.This is well worth watching. Definitely not for everyone but also considered a gem by others. Fully recommend watching this twice: First just enjoy the movie and let it rattle your brain, Secondly watch it from Em's (Emily Baldoni) perspective and concentrate on her story.The concept here sells this movie and the execution exceeds expectation.

192,bseaman-20248,The movie should be called Incoherence,3,20 August 2017,"I am surprised by the number of positive reviews and ratings. As I have suggested before for other independent, low-budget movies that over-populate Netflix, I think that the people who kicked in a few dollars to produce the movie must have posted glowing reviews in order to sustain a high enough rating on IMDb to lure viewers into watching.Coherence wasn't so god-awful that I stopped watching 10 minutes in and searched for something else on Netflix. I sat through it to its incoherent end, curious to see how the movie would end and how the film-maker's evident attempt to explain quantum physics through cinema would play out. Parallel realities and universes is typically an interesting, if clichéd, concept in the science fiction genre. Properly used, the concept can make for an intriguing and thought-provoking viewing experience.However, the ending made no sense to me. And no, in spite of what I've read a few other people say about having to go back to watch the movie again, two or three times if necessary, in order to understand the ending, I am not going to do so. I can spend three hours of my life doing something else.Finally, I skimmed through an interview with the director, who offers an explanation as to what Coherence is all about.

I'm sure I'll watch it again. I appreciated all aspects of the movie, from the plot to the camera-work to the acting, but the intricately plotted story is the element that stands out the most.It won't be clear what the movie is about or what's even happening at first, but even the very first scene of the movie becomes involved in later events. So pay attention, and just wait for it.As I usually do, I read many of the ""Hated It"" reviews out of curiosity. In response to some of the criticisms I've seen:I felt that the shaky camera-work was supposed to represent the state of mind and perspective of the people at the party. It's a party. Everybody's at least drinking, in addition to other activities. This tends to make one's perspective a little shaky. I didn't even really notice it most of the time, but when I did I felt it only added to the scene.Many people have commented on bad acting, but didn't say who or why. Many times I think people accuse movies of having bad acting simply because they haven't met someone like the character, or because the characters aren't fulfilling the stereotypes they expected. I feel like that is most of what's happening here. I thought that Mike and Hugh's actors gave particularly good performances.A few have mentioned plot holes, but not what those holes might be. Considering what's happening around them, problems with continuity are appropriate. Please remember that just because a character makes a deduction about what's causing events, that doesn't mean that they're correct.As far as the ending, this is definitely one of the best ones I've seen in recent memory.

There are infinite possible realities, often separated only by minor differences, but sometimes by major ones. One character goes as far as to ""surf"" the alternate realities, eventually selecting the one she finds most desirable... but there is a catch.The flaws in this movie made more sense once I learned of its limited budget and tight shooting schedule (only 5 days). No doubt the film would have been of higher quality with a bigger budget and more time. It still comes off very well, though. It just has a sense of being rushed and unfinished.

213,dysamoria,Highly rated by an audience as (mis)informed as the characters,4,28 June 2018,"I wish people would pay more attention to what motivated Schrödinger's analogy (describing the absurdity of the contemporary theory on quantum mechanics).Okay, I can accept that the characters are not savvy enough to talk knowledgeably about quantum mechanics, and the audience is equally ill-equipped to understand actual quantum mechanics... but, it seems the filmmakers themselves are ill-equipped to use anything but bad popular metaphysics. It's all just a pile of pseudoscience nonsense. Throwing ""quantum"" into a script doesn't make it science fiction. That's just the woo-ification of the word. Promoting the story as science fiction does no service to the audience or to science.But let's talk about the characters: why all the fear, paranoia, and hostility? Myself and people I know would have been filled with curiosity and wonder, had we been in the position of the film's characters. Are we supposed to believe that these characters are representative of average people, such as those of us in the audience? If so, it feels false, at best, and insulting at worst. Scripted hostility and paranoia tends to feel false to me in many films and shows, but it's even worse here. I think that the method of filmmaking used (notes and improv, rather than scripts) is exactly the cause: Instead of giving actors a well-drawn scripted story, with sensible character motivations, a room full of improv actors was forced to come up with their own interpretations based on a few daily notes given them by the director. It's no wonder that the notion of a room full of friends feels like a room full of isolated, disparate microcosms.The budgetary constraints are probably the major driver behind the contrived character behaviors: we can't have people engage in curiosity, because then the director would have to film the results. Instead, they're instructed to be fearful, so the director can keep the visuals simple and eliminate the need for extensive difficult in-camera tricks or expensive visual effects.I want to appreciate the effort and ideas tried in this film, but the end result left me irritated by the pseudoscience and the character behavior. This was not entertainment. It was an exercise in forcing myself to sit through something actively annoying. I could not identify with these paranoid and irrational characters. I would not have willingly spent an evening with these people in real life; watching them on screen for 88 minutes was more than enough. Was the filmmaker's goal to annoy the audience?There's no objective measure or accounting for taste, but seeing this film treated to praise such as ""cerebral"" (when that's not an insult, because anti-intellectualism) and ""intelligent"" just annoys me. It reminds me just how credulous and uncritical audiences are. In fact, there's a sad irony here: the characters, with their credulous consumption and regurgitation of bad pop science articles and woo are misinterpreted as ""intelligent and aware"" by an audience composed of exactly the same type of people.",Coherence

And my brother said to call him if anything strange happened, because you know, comet. They do the darndest things, just like that famous weird meteor explosion in Russia.Crossing multiple realities and the resulting confusion of who's from where and who belongs where and what are they trying to do and why, is the one new twist here.

It's complex, intriguing and has great potential to be an amazing one, but it ultimately fails, hard. A particular thing that I think holds thrillers like this is the attention to details the audience must have in order to gain the full understanding of the film, but not here. The longer the it goes, the more you understand the small details don't matter, and while they might add up, you don't derive anything interesting or new from them.The beginning is very boring and while the tension and pace go up, the film does it too slow, to little. In trying to remedy that perhaps, the last twenty minutes are incredibly violent and horror-like when compared to the rest of the film. But the most awful thing was the camera-work, I don't think it stood still for the entire film, and made me a bit dizzy at times.

Seriously?",4,20 September 2016,"Pretty poor cinema (as a previous comment mentioned, something out of a US sitcom from the 90s, like Friends + sci-fi - comedy). Science (reference to quantum entanglement) is here more like name-dropping than anything else, with no plausible connection to the plot, no sense of any deep understanding of how the theory could apply to macro phenomena. Quantum concepts are here, basically, a pretext to set up a thought experiment in the guise of a (mostly indoors) drama piece, but fail to make any interesting inroads other than superficially treated and re-hashed stuff (possible worlds model, very lite, for dummies). Thus, hardly profound sci-fi. Neither is this in the metaphysical cinema genre with a sci-fi veneer, where invoking some facts with a superficial connection to science opens the door to philosophical explorations of modalities of reality (I have Tarkovsky's Solaris or Stalker here in mind, for instance). On the contrary, there was hardly any interesting reflection or character development to support this. Instead, rather flat personalities populated the screen, whirling around incessantly and inexplicably, often giving unintuitive responses to the bizarre developments around them.

This film relies heavily on incessant dialogue, hence its allusion to a stage play. This dialogue is beautifully handled and totally convincing. There are no awkward silences in this movie! I do wonder how many takes were done to achieve the seamless flow of chatter that flowed between the extremely talented cast. OK, much of the plot was fairly inscrutable, but did we care?

It does so brilliantly, in my opinion, and from the very beginning. (Note : I would watch this without being spoiled, which I am about to do.)The basic plot is that a comet causes ""coherence"" (i.e., the opposite of decoherence, which is a quantum mechanics phenomenon that some believe causes the world to ""branch"" into multiple different versions) which brings a large number of other worlds together. The guests at a dinner party encounter slightly different versions of themselves.A watcher knowing nothing about the film (as I was originally) would not pick up on this, but the film establishes early on that it is set in a world alternate even to the viewer's world (""our"" world). It does so by using an actor who most of us would recognize from Buffy the Vampire Slayer playing an actor who was not in Buffy, but was the lead in the show Roswell. (Roswell existed as a show in our world, but this actor was not the lead in Roswell.) As well, characters get small things wrong about each other from the jump, which in retrospect one realizes means that the worlds ""cohered"" even before the dinner guests arrived at their hosts' house. (The beginning of the coherence is depicted by the main character's phone cracking as the movie just begins, but the viewer only realizes that retrospectively, if at all.) This is ironic, because the guests ultimately realize that that there are other versions of themselves that are getting all mixed up and panic about it, even though they were mixed up from the jump and oblivious to it. It is this thoughtfulness (and playfulness) that forces me to give all the stars, even though I don't like doing that. Throughout the film, there are lots of subtle things happening and said which are easy to miss and reward repeat viewing.It's also worth pointing out that there's an underlying emotional story here, too: a woman whose calling as a dancer was missed by chance and who uses the coherence as a way of taking back control.

Filmed on a budget of $50,000 at the director's own house over just 5 days, the actors were just given cards with their backstories and what they had to convey, as well as major plot points which they would have to get to. Nobody knew anything on the others' cards. All the reactions are spontaneous - there was no script. One of the actors even said that he didn't know how the movie ended (because he wasn't in the final scene) until he saw the movie itself on screen. Even if I didn't know that about the movie, it would still be one of the best movies I have seen in my life. One of the most incredible things is how it toys with your perspective - how much you know about who's who and what's going on versus how much the characters themselves know amongst the tangled mess of relationships and who-did-what-when.I guess that aspect has something to do with the fact that the cast themselves didn't know the whole picture (apparently the director told them 'Show up at my house in a couple of days. I can't really tell you what we're doing, trust me I'm not going to kill you. It should be fun'!). It feels like you're watching the most f**ked-up, complicated party game unfold before your eyes. And the way it pieces together at the end is just magic. The twists and turns and new discoveries made by the characters and us the audience blew my mind in the same way that Mulholland Drive or Shutter Island blew my mind. But this blew my mind more.Part of me wishes I could make this film (or something like this) at my house with my friends for such a low budget, but I have to say I could never do something like this. Never in a million years. Hats off to the director and the cast especially, but also to the gorgeous music and editing.

With a small and (at first) simple plot the slow and then onrushing twists just keep coming. I loved the beginnings of character development that were interrupted by events . . . I loved the simple but brave framing from the director, with no flourishes, just relying on his actors to get the job done. And the spiral out of control in the last 30 minutes was pretty well handled too. I have to say this was a really solid little film that just sat there and kept punching. I was impressed. Is it totally successful? Probably not, but as Disney found out with John Carter, you can pour 200 million into a flick and end up with a bland, forgettable flick. This one stays with you and hats off to all involved. Think about it later and discuss it with your mates . . . the variables are just mind boggling. Well done.",Coherence

For those coming in skeptical it may first appear to be a cheesy low budget film but after the first 10 or 20 minutes the real essence of it starts to shine through. This movie does a great job at creating tense scenarios, feelings of uneasiness and lots of head scratching moments. What I really enjoy is that all these feelings are created out of paranoia and not your cliche horror/thriller moments (for me it greatly reflects a sort of Twilight Zone feeling). Without revealing anything too major people who are fans of the above mentioned as well as ""Multiple Realities"" or strange inexplicable occurrences will really enjoy this film and I feel that the not so recognizable cast does a very good job at making the whole thing feel a bit more on the realistic/believable side. They're fantastic at acting and portraying everything so naturally.In short this movie is trippy, it's going to make you think and want to rewatch it and it's going to create some great tense and paranoia induced situations which I believe most people will enjoy!",Coherence

Well, Coherence spits right into the stereotypes' faces, being one of the most unorthodox yet one of the most thrilling Sci-Fi movie ever. With only a 50k dollars budget, this movie took home several awards and thrilled Sci-Fi fans around the world. The whole movie was mostly flawless, and the most beautiful part was the cast. The cast gave it their all on this one. Their insane dedication made this movie more terrifying than the story already is. The seriousness of their fears and the little gags along and the avoidance of scientific blabbers and special effects made it more believable, which in turn, made it more horrifying.Coherence is a claustrophobic, bizzaire and down to earth creep fest that will leave you with an awe, for a long long time.

There are many shots from different angles, zooming in on faces pointing out a little bit of each character together with their lines. A bit American personalities there of course, but you can't say it's a bad movie because you don't like the characters. They are what they are and we get it clearly.It looks like the camera is hand-held but I'm not sure, it's not too irritating anyway. And there is also something I haven't seen before: Many shots starts blurry but focuses quickly, a variant of shaky camera that is very effective but maybe overused in this film.The story is also ""handheld"" in my opinion, as is the performance. In the beginning there are many cuts with a second of black screen, but we don't notice that anything important happens between those cuts, so why are they there?Important things happens instead totally inexplicable in the scenes, and you really wonder what is wrong with these people?The plot however is really intriguing. You might need to watch this twice in order to disregard from the annoying details and look at it as a study of psychology.But no matter how many times I see it, I wonder: What is the meaning of this film?

For a while, it was very entertaining and even thrilling to watch, but at a sudden point the thing that was going on invited so much randomness, so many possibilities, that I cared less and less about the fate of the supposed main character(s), until I had peace with any kind of ending for anyone. It could have been anything, and admittedly, almost anything would have been fair enough; instead, a great majority of the extravaganza seemed to be suddenly discarded in the end. It would've been much more interesting if there had been a dramatic clash of events in a big get-together kind of way, instead of just focusing on this one minor thing.

Its rare to find such an honest piece of film-making in the science fiction genre, and this one explores complex ideas of shame, fear and envy very neatly, using established psychological/analytical models such as transference and projection to illustrate its points.

The problem is... things accelerate at such a high rate, that you quickly figure out that the details don't matter. If the movie had a smaller scale, or a more claustrophobic feel, I think it would have worked better. In a mind-bending movie like this, usually noticing details is what pieces everything together. But here, most of what happens turns out to not be of any consequence.

People were acting a bit awkward (maybe because they were drunk) and it was painful to see people trying to pull the pointless conversations through. The story escalated immediately after the cracked Phone screen of Huge and the power cut. Suddenly people realized that something unusual was happening so the uneasiness spread across the crowd. None of them at the time knew that once they went out, they would pass through some dark aisle and enter a different space. The movie traces the viewpoint of Em, who only came to realize that all the people in her surrounding were not those of her original world anymore. She first struggled to make her way back, but then she realized that there were too many parallel universes out there and she could never make it back. The people with her in the original world were also scattered. Therefore, she thought of leaving and to ""invade"" a good world where she was a successful dancer and her boyfriend was in love with her. Her searching for the new world stopped after she spotted this perfect world where people didn't even know about the parallel universe. She killed ""the other her"" and passed out. In the morning, everything seemed to lay out as she wished, until she shocked herself and the audience that now there are two Em in one world. The Em who belongs to the world did not even step out of her house (her phone was working proves that she was unaffected by the comet) and contacted Kevin. Now Kevin knows that the Em standing in front of him is a freaky stranger duplicate of his girlfriend. It is appalling to think about what's going to happen to the invader Em.",Coherence

Not only is it shaky cam but the shots are out of focus in places and the framing has bits of people cut off as they speak. Just appalling.This is the result you'd get by having a 5 year old who has never shot with a camera loose.The sad thing is this was done by adults and there must have been much time spent misframing shots and getting the focus wrong.I seriously do not get this style of filming.

Every time a scripted part comes up the line delivery feels so damn forced that you can actually measure when they switch between improvising and scripted exposition. The idea it's self is really cool but I was consistently frustrated with how wasted of an idea it was. They barely do anything interesting with it. There's so many possibilities here but nothing is really showed except one house and a vague dark street. At a certain point I just stopped caring entirely about the plot. I'd never cared about the characters who were all painfully obvious. The first half hour was so incredibly boring and tedious. I wanted to see reality bend, not a long ass time of a bunch of actors mucking around improving. This would make a much better theater show. There weren't even any special effects or tricks used so you could literally just put it on a stage.

Rick and Morty handle this ""idea"" in a much more ""Coherent"" and logical way. Unfortunately, the ending left a lot to be desired and the last 15 minutes-ish, brought up much more interesting ideas, conflicts and possibilities that would have made the story quite good if explored(better than the white people problems the 2 acts force you to sit through).

297,AndreaBeaumont,movie we saw is just a single frame of the larger story,10,20 March 2017,"and so would my rating, if possible, break out the limits of 1-10 What is most funny is that we cannot be sure of absolutely anything depicted, because it is likely this movie is only limited period of a story far beyond it's frame.It is clearly shown that Laurie and Mike have no recollection of each other, as if they haven't met before. A director's clue is almost explicit in line ""I guess it must be another girl that Kevin dated and Amir is hooking up with"". Besides, it is stated the technology failures occurred during the day of the dinner party, the comet was affecting the world throughout some time.The whole ""original house"" may not even be as original, because the group goes outside to watch the comet, and when they return in, one glass on the table is broken. It seems the have changed the entire setting (the house itself) as a unit.Bonus clue for the never-ending ending debate: there are two rings after the comet falling apart. If material objects are preserved, so may be are people as well.. Especially if we consider another line told by Lee (or someone else), how the house is the box and they are the Schroedinger's cat. Therefore anyone in the house is not affected by outside turmoils. Original Emily has left her double in the bathtub, in the house. She simply.. cannot be dead or evaporated. Besides, if the strange effects started before the nighttime of previous day, why would they end with the sunrise? Another interesting phenomenon is the last house itself. It seems not to have been impacted at all, by the comet. No note, no one knocking, no interferences according to their behavior.The other interesting phenomenon are the electric blackouts, happening for unknown reason. In one interview the director clued on following Emily at all times. However these blackouts are cutting us from her, and that may also be significant.The last thing I'd like to mention is the scene by the car, where Emily and Kevin meet, and realize they're not from the same realities.

For example, after a neighborhood blackout a couple of guys return from an outing with a metal case containing pictures of everyone in the group. A real person would assume a joke is being played on them or that someone is having a little fun at their expense. Not this group of people. They immediately assume some unexplainable event must be occurring. Why? Because the plot needs them to. They make absolutely no attempt to find a logical explanation for the events that are going on. To the contrary, based on a single paragraph out of a random quantum mechanics book they all assume that what is happening must be supernatural. From there the movie continues to devolve into a series of ridiculous character actions and motivations that defy any semblance of human nature. In fact, it was beyond ridiculous, I would go so far as to say it was unwatchable.If you don't require believable explanations for character motivations then you might be able to enjoy this movie.

It takes you for a ride along a journey that keeps building and building, and never disappoints. Each scene is well scripted and as the plot grows more and more information is added, yet masterfully, they don't make it obvious how it will end.

I am included in the second group and, from this decision, you are going to give up on the trip is being proposed by the creators, or surrender to the main character's drama as much as I did. Coherence is not an easy movie if you're into Hollywood aesthetic productions and don't enjoy indie flicks easily.The photograph is yellowish, dark, and melancholic; the camera is purposefully careless, the dialogues are overlaid and tumultuous; and this mix of techniques are the final ingredients to push viewers to decide their feelings about the movie at the very beginning of the screening.

Most impressed with the acting over the rest. Still sad to see so little of Nicholas Brendon these days. He and all of them were perfect, which makes sense now that I've read here about the improvisation.There is a lot more to consider about the film after reading the Trivia section. I thought something was off about the Quantum Physics discussions! That said, my main problem is with in-movie physics and a nagging clash.Spoiler Alert! Kind of.All the little differences so very subtle (and not) between versions, that there was something jarring about Mike's line to his best friend just before the fisticuffs:There is no way that versions so different as to have different jobs/TV roles could all have done what Mike claims they all must have.And no way would they all have made identical styling choices.

Yet, we discover at the start that when one gets hurt, the same person from a different reality is hurt in the same way.Also, huge plot hole. But this character would just go find the box with the paddle, with the blue glow stick and the unopened red ones, to find her real place and then go back to where she is meant to be.The fact she thought she could 'fit' into another reality is why people kept asking her what was going on as she was acting weird. It would never have worked.It would have been easier to have drawn an image on everyone's skin, under a sleeve or something.I'll give the movie props for starting to dwell and investigate alternate realities. But there's something that they missed out on and something much more terrifying. It's when all the people that character knows start acting like complete strangers to her. And then she has to pretend that everything is normal.I don't mean adding murder and mayhem just for the conflict side of it. But if others got confused and ended up in her reality.

But, even noticing this I decided to watch the movie until the end, it was still good and can be also good for you if you don't expect so much. I think that the important thing about the Schroedinger's thought experiment isn't so much the multiple realities itself(I thinks this idea is just absurd, sorry), but the sole idea that you cannot know certain things without interfering in the event you are trying to know or make calculations. I don't think people should make so much fuss about the multiple realities idea, but it seems to be very catchy in a society that worships science sometimes in a very blind and uncritical way.How I think the movie could have been better: Maybe if the mystery of the movie was more centered in the psychological effects caused by the comet it could have been more original and less confusing. Imagine that one person started to act weird and violent because of the comet effects and the others decided to protect themselves. They would be very ambivalent about defending themselves from people that are or were their friends, at the same time they would also be insecure about what could happen next, anyone of them could also start acting weird. Anyway I think the movie could have been way better exploring possible dark psychological effects caused by the comet. Watch ""Pontypool"", which is much better than ""Coherence"" in my opinion, in ""Pontypool"" people start to act weird when infected by words, I found it was very original without being so confuse, ""Coherence"" could have followed this path. I think also that the movie ""Another Earth"" did a better job with the ""more than one reality idea"".My conclusion is that movie directors have to be very cautious when adapting scientific ideas, they could ruin things.",Coherence

The power goes out and weird things begin to happen. I don't really want to say anymore because the experience of watching events unfold is part of the fun of this movie. But I will say, from there the movie creates great suspense and intrigued me while our characters discover what exactly is happening and find clever ways of dealing with the obstacles they face.There are quite a few characters in this movie that aren't all as memorable but the performances from everyone is great with just a minor complaint, I really didn't figure out the true protagonist and antagonist characters until the conclusion of the movie and throughout the movie you can possibly assign these roles to many different characters depending on your point of view. The ending I enjoyed very much and again begs to question who is the actual protagonist and antagonist in the movie. I guess its all a mater of how you view the film and your own moral values or opinions. I would like to buy the Blu-Ray if there is commentary on the movie to get a deeper understanding of some of the things that transpire through the film. I gave the film a 9/10 as opposed to a ten as I felt there was plenty of directions the film could have went that it didn't explore as much and due to the nature of what transpires during the passing of the comet it is is difficult to keep up with who exactly is who (You'll understand when you see the movie) without a second viewing.Anyways, I highly highly recommend people see this movie!This is definitely not your typical sci fi flick, it seems more like a drama/thriller with sci-fi elements as plot devices. The best thing the movie does is putting yourself in these character's shoes and thinking about what you would do in the situation they are in and watching them try to figure out the best course of action to deal with it.

I think 7/10 is a fair rating - it's a fun, engaging movie, not a masterpiece but worth a watch.Criticisms - I agree that some of the interpersonal conflicts among the dinner party participants are rather banal and play out in predictable ways. Of course, the focus of the film is how the altered reality affects these predictable conflicts, but there were still some moments when I was like ""yeah, yeah, of course"". I think it's cool that a lot of the dialogue was improvised, but there were a couple of lines that made me roll my eyes. And while I'm not mean enough to criticize movie pseudoscience, I do have to say that in real life, no adult needs the concept of Schrodinger's cat explained to them.

I'm not really a movie person; for whatever reason, books tend to keep my attention better. My favorite movies are all very dense in one way or another - there needs to be a lot to keep track of, otherwise I tune out. And this one sure does have a lot to keep track of! I was riveted from start to finish, trying to figure out what was going on. One of the things that absorbed me was the camera work and editing! If you're the type of person who's physically nauseated by shaky cam, this movie is NOT for you, but I was very impressed by the way the odd transitions and out-of-focus shots perfectly complemented the themes of the film and gave clues as to what was going on before the scenario had been fully set up (I realized this in retrospect - very cool!). The soundscape of the movie, with people often talking over each other, also contributed to the disorienting atmosphere. The acting was good, I think, given what the actors were working with. As I said, the interpersonal conflicts weren't super interesting in themselves, but it all felt more or less natural.I didn't find the movie mindblowingly good and I'm surprised at people saying its one of the best, better than Arrival (really???), etc. But I'm also surprised at the people calling it ""boring"" or saying the editing is ""bad"".

I think there was no enough motivation to resort to violence. 2. also, if the characters found out that interfering with another reality would destabilise the balance why would they carry on interfering, why they think that it would solve the problem, besides there is no real problem or threat, everything is based on theoretical propositions. In other words, I did not see enough evidence or necessity (even in their proposed theories) for them to think about threat or violence. In the end one of the characters tries to knock/pass out herself from another reality, which was at the initial phase, so I thought she wanted to guide others not to interfere or give some clues but later she resorts to even more violence, which does not make sense to me, as they did not have any realistic theory, which would imply that somehow the other selves from another realities would cause trouble. anyway how hurting/harming themselves would solve the ""problem"", not demonstrated.3. probably most of us would freak out in these kind of conditions but at least one of them should have been interested just to make a contact with him/herself - non of them was holding a gun or knife and non of them seemed a violent person, normal intelligent people, who I am sure would have acted differently in reality as there was no immediate or visible threat to their lives. 4. maybe there were all hallucinated by that drug, also I am sure there are more clues in the film than I noticed, especially about that drug near the end but as mentioned earlier could not watch second time. furthermore, there was a strange call right at the end, which suggests that it was not a hallucination.it is good that the story is open to interpretations but for me the actions pursued by the characters require more motivation and reasoning than shown in the movie....",Coherence

Also one more thing, the phone call st the begining. Probably happened during two different timelines.

But they usually don't disappoint and live up to their reputation. Coherence is no different. To paraphrase a classic: Much ahype about nothing. Those who try to pawn this as a masterpiece of cinematography might be blinded by their strong urge to focus on brilliant plots and the makers' ability to utilize every penny in an honorable way that they simply don't see the reality of bad acting compensated by overacting compensated by needless (and misplaced) profanity and covered up by a shaky cam (because it's the norm nowadays, no?) I did not expect a perfect movie, flawless plot or spectacular acting but I did not find a fraction of my expectations. Frankly, I cannot provide any good spoilers because I turned the film off before half-way. I cannot say that I enjoyed this Blair Witch Project wannabe footage. Was this a high-school project made by 16-year-olds? I was insulted by the actors' constant attempts at redemption by squeezing emotion into tight corners. I stopped watching SNL years ago when the cast was replaced by clueless and talentless understudies whose constant failure kept calling for supplements by more understudies. Thinking so little of SNL, you can probably now start to understand what I mean when I say that this movie's cast presented a new low in my book. To sum up this flick, watch it only if you have no standards and are bored out of your mind. Be prepared for bad acting, lots of angry yelling, gasps of surprise, fear and other poorly expressed emotions. And most of all: you have been forewarned.",Coherence

This is only my second review as I just have to shout out to the people whom are involved in this film once again, coming onto IMDb under an alias to really hype up, a terrible awful, boring science documentary. To me, they have took a drama documentary from the history channels (documentary channels) blended it together with actors from poor poor very poor porn movies and this is the result. A boring awful mess. The dialogue is good if not for the actors trying so hard to act it's so noticeable, almost as if done on purpose. Look you can either act or you can't, I'm a songwriter but I don't! Have a recordable voice, I can't sing amazing, so I get superior vocalists to sing my material - are we getting it! The dialogue and editing is really messy ridiculous alongside lazy. The story has so many plot holes it should be renamed wormhole. I wish someone had the sense to place in plot summary, scientific drama- documentary as it's clearly not Sci-Fi. Boring, dull, poor acting, awful story from what could, have been so mysterious & suspenseful, this idea had the potential to have the audience on the edge of their seats, thinking what's happening, what's next. I never saw that coming etc. instead it's the worst movie I have ever seen, period. I thought 'Alter Ego's' and 'Monster's' were as bad as my eyes & ears could ever witness to bare but this comes in at, guess! No1, for the worst. You figure it all out, the story whats going to happen within 10 minute's and know how it will turn out. Combined with the laziest ending in movie history, yep. People unlike me, actually walked out on this movie at a screening in UK, wish I had done the same. Don't rent or buy. To the producers, stop coming on IMDb under an alias and hyping up ya movie I can sense a critic or movie team within one phrase, to critics, stop taking back handers to hype it up, to IMDb stop allowing anyone involved in the making if a film to give a review of their film as it's a rip off, a con, which is illegal and lawsuits can be filed against them.",Coherence

372,ChadCarsten,'Coherence' is a thrilling mind bender!,9,5 May 2014,"Re-energizing the low budget scifi genre, this mind bender centers around a single dinner party on a night where a comet is passing over Earth, causing some strange occurrences. The film keeps you at the edge of your seat from the first frame to the last, primarily a result of the experimental production process by which director James Ward Byrkit only gave the actors notes about their goals for each scene (there was no script). This allowed the actors to fully improvise the moments when and how they'd attempt to achieve their goals. The tight setting and masterful editing keeps us super close to the action, sometimes purposefully uncomfortably close. The result is that 'Coherence' becomes an instant scifi crowd pleaser...and hopefully the start of a new filmmaking trend. The twists and turns kept me thinking for days, and I can't wait to watch it again. See it with friends -- I guarantee it'll spark some really fun debates.",Coherence

When you hear about an indie movie, that was filmed in an experimental way, with no real written script, you'd expect to get something pretentious and almost unwatchable, but instead you get a riveting, fast moving and scary masterpiece. By all accounts, this shouldn't work, but the fact that none of the characters know what's going on, and the actors have to piece together what happens by themselves, create this unique situation, where you can trust nothing anyone says, while trying yourself to figure out what is happening, through this unreliable cast. Rarely has a movie been able to fill me so effectively with unease, and it does so, solely through mystery.Seeing as any exposition we ever get in the movie is unreliable, the sci-fi element is mostly reduced to the classic ""what if?"", but if you want to piece together an actual explanation, multiple re-watches of the movie is recommended, as each time you see new things. I have had many long discussions about this movie with friends, and there has been written a lot about it on the net, so if you need more than psychological studies of humans, this movie provides.An absolutely riveting movie, acted and told in a unique way. Everyone that I know who has ever seen it has loved it, and even if you dislike this genre, it is worth seeing for the storytelling alone. The cast in Alien in the scene with the chestburster was not informed that that would happen, and therefore their reactions were that much more natural. Imagine if the whole movie had been made like that. That is what Coherence is.",Coherence

375,d_h95,Low-budget sci-fi is mind bendingly entertaining,8,17 December 2017,"Coherence, a tense, cerebral sci-fi thriller is the directorial debut of James Ward Byrkit. On a night when a comet is passing unusually close to earth, a group of friends gather for a dinner party taking place in the home of married couple Mike (Nicholas Brendon) and Lee (Lorene Scafaria). However, the night quickly takes a turn for the unexpected as power goes out in the neighbourhood, all except one house. The easy-going banter doesn't take long to get tense as we start seeing the cracks in these relationships.This film is best experienced without any previous knowledge on what it's about, so I won't say any more about the plot. What I will say is that Coherence is a prime example of independent, low budget film making done right. It proves that you don't need a huge budget to create a compelling story. Whilst some may be put off by the low budget feel and the dialogue heavy film, I found the largely improvised dialogue to be refreshingly real. The ensemble cast is a vehicle for the audience, being as clueless as we are to the events as they unfold. Much like the characters, the actors themselves had no idea what was going on, as the director went into the filming process not with a screenplay, but a twelve-page treatment. Each day, the cast were provided with character notes and a brief idea of the situation, and they managed to pull off remarkable performances. 
I found the shaky camerawork, often going out of focus, to be a bit distracting, but it was less of a stylistic choice and more a matter of necessity as Byrkit wanted the actors to have a freedom of movement, allowing them to do what felt natural for their character. Although I did have questions about the logic used by characters at certain points in the film, it was remarkably easy to suspend disbelief. There really is a lot to enjoy about Byrkit's method, being able to immediately hook the audience and keep us relentlessly trying to guess the direction the story is going in until the very end.",Coherence

I was just not expecting what happened. Many twists kept me on edge! This movie is from the Point of View of the lead actress from the poster of Coherence. All other characters are variable. You will see what I mean when you watch the movie. In the beginning they just talk about random stuff and their issues surface. After that the lights go out and after that weird stuff starts happening. This is one of the movies where a lot of things happen without many things happening.

Nothing is cinematic about pitch black scenes-nor is it cinematic in the first 15 minutes of emotionally drained actors taking up half of the foreground, it might be hard to notice that due to the fact that there is 1000 jump cuts that take place.The story was only interesting after 15 minutes but then after the following 5 minutes you easily could predict the rest of the movieI will say that I can see why a simpleton could be mind numbingly occupied while watching this but for anyone that has over 3 brain cells could understand how bad this movie is.",Coherence

The director and several of the actors in the film answered audience questions after the premier - the film was shot in only five days after a year of script work.

I stopped paying attention to the story and couldn't help but focus on the strained attempt at relationship. Initially they express contempt for a woman who hadn't arrived to the gathering yet. This contempt was apparently because she flaunts her beauty with tight, skimpy clothing. When she finally arrives, she was not nearly what was described. She was attractive but not beautiful and dressed appropriately.

The acting mustn't be too over the top, nor the dialogue too energetic/dramatic.

Sorry, to me the change was too sudden and it appears made only to move you quickly into the end chapter. I don't like the ending, I think it could have been a lot better with a bit more thought.

Every possible outcome must be realized. If not here, then somewhere else. Somewhere only slightly different from here! I was shocked to discover that the story was highly improvised. Every actor knew the traits of only their character, not of anybody else's. You can imagine the kind of weird stuff gets when you've to figure out the story as you live the story(or film the story, in this case). Overall, I would say it is for those who like weird and who enjoy a little mental exercise. It got a bit scary at times, but keeps you guessing what will happen next.

It takes place in a single acre of land and yet the suspense and surprise make this film creepy but not scary.Now, this movie is not prefect. I thought the ending was a little cheesy and I saw a couple loopholes but they were very very minor. The comet causing this change in quantum physics is the driving force of the plot but it could just as easily been replaced with a 100 year recurrence tilt on the earth for example. And I think that's a problem, because the comet itself is irrelevant to what occurs in the film itself.Overall, even with this, this I would say is a masterpiece of what low-budget, small time actors can produce and make something completely original that nobody can compare to any I film (I could be wrong).",Coherence

A unique style of sci-fi that I wish there was more of (especially in lieu of the copious amount of time travel movies people make). It doesn't have, or need, special effects. That along with the story-line likely led to a low overall production cost, but didn't affect the quality; I'm sure to the delight of the producer. I also enjoyed the display of emotion from the characters. I'm giving it an extra star for it's distinctiveness.",Coherence

I have seen several f**k mind films but only this film which can touch my feeling even I have seen it many times. I always wonder if I were Em, near the end of the film, should I go and find for myself the happiest house? -_- . My self in another world, I am glad that (may be) you are happier than me.",Coherence
396,boran_boynuk,Impressive,8,5 August 2017,"First 10-15 minutes into the movie I thought to myself ""They are having a really good conversation, like a real friends and family meeting"". It was after seeing the movie that I learned that most of the talking was improvisation and I liked it a lot. I think it's clear that it adds a natural vibe into it. In some scenes, there are multiple characters speaking at the same time which creates a chaos but that's realistic. I'm not sure if I would have liked it better if they had used a stable more standard filming technique instead of a constantly moving camera but I think it went well with the single location thriller concept. Overall the movie was original, pretty interesting scenario. Not sure if it would worth watching it a second time but definitely a movie that I will recommend to my friends and family.",Coherence
397,katemattinglyart,Great surprising movie,10,24 April 2020,"I love this movie. I think I've watched it about 6 times over the years. This movie was obviously made with a tiny budget, the whole movie basically takes place in one house. No effects, nothing fancy, just great writing. Do yourself a favor, watch it. If you love sci-fi and puzzles you'll be destined to show this movie to your friends for years.",Coherence
398,larissaantusoa,I hated it!,1,3 March 2018,"Couldnt even finish this.. nothing wrong with low budget movies but that camera, the edit, image composition. Its just crap! Was it too hard to find a tripod to shoot this movie? What a waste of time.",Coherence
399,mikemorg-64835,Confusing!,3,28 March 2020,It was interesting but had a very confused story line. You have to pay super close attention to what is said and what is going on but if you do it is a pretty dang good film.,Coherence
