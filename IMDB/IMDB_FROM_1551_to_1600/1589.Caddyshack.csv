0,MartinHafer,worth seeing for just a few funny parts,5,20 April 2006,"As I sit here thinking about this movie, I am realizing that this is one of the few comedies I wouldn't mind if it were heavily edited first. In other words, if all the funny moments (i.e., all the stuff with Rodney Dangerfield) were shown and the rest of the film pitched in the trash, I DON'T think that would be so bad. That's because despite it's achieving ""cult status"", this isn't all that good a film--with sloppy direction, an annoying performance by Bill Murray (who is capable of so much better), a worthless story about some teenagers (and I HATE most teenager movies from the 70s and 80s) and a rather wooden performance by Chevy Chase. Hmmm,...now that I think about it, apart from Rodney Dangerfield and, perhaps the cute groundhog, there isn't a whole lot I loved about the film. A sub-par film saved by genuinely funny dialog between Dangerfield and Ted Knight.",Caddyshack
1,bkoganbing,Heavy duty humor,8,29 May 2018,"Golf and those who play it becomes the subject of some heavy duty humor in
Caddyshack. Some of the funniest folks in the last half of the last century are
involved with Caddyshack.With many little subplots going the main plot involves the rivalry between the
head of the club Ted Knight who is also a judge and Rodney Dangerfield who is
a filthy rich and brash visitor. Dangerfield is his usually cheerful and obnoxious character, but he presses Knight's buttons. Some of the funniest
moments of the film is Knight reacting to Dangerfield. Chevy Chase is an interesting fellow himself, a rather iconoclastic character who doesn't even keep score as he explains his philosophy of life to young
Michael O'Keefe who is one of the caddies just trying to pick up some extra
dollars and suck up to the rich who are regulars at the club.Knight reminds me of the character of the father of the prospective bride whom Auntie Mame was desperately trying to keep nephew Patrick from
marrying. Willard Waterman in Auntie Mame was not on his home ground
and Rosalind Russell capitalizes on that. You see Knight on his home turf (no pun intended) but it yields him no advantage as Dangerfield just shows him 
up over and over.We cannot forget Bill Murray who is an iconoclastic character in his own right.
He's one of the groundskeepers and has been assigned the task of ridding the
world of gopher who has taken residence at the country club and leaving inconvenient holes in the ground. It's a battle of wits and guess who comes
out on top?Henry Wilcoxon plays a Catholic bishop who likes to golf. He isn't exactly Father O'Malley moved up in the ranks. Wilcoxon is best known for all the
Cecil B. DeMille films he did and his final scene has a DeMille like quality. With the gopher character Caddyshack expertly blends animation with the live
players. Big kudos go out to the animators for the gopher.Don't expect any sophistication, but Caddyshack will give you lots of belly laughs with many to spare",Caddyshack
2,Leofwine_draca,Above average comedy of its era,7,18 March 2016,"I find the po-faced seriousness with which golfers take their sport to be rather funny, so this lampoon of the whole golf industry is a delight to watch. It's a bit of a madcap character piece with lots of offbeat stars interacting and getting involved with one another, and at some moments it's similar to the surreal highlights of AIRPLANE, although it also has that 'frat house party' style atmosphere popular from the early '80s.What I particularly enjoy about CADDYSHACK is that there's no single star. Chevy Chase pops up here and there to deliver some delightful non-sequiters, and Bill Murray steals every scene he's in playing the slow-witted groundsman. My favourite star of all, though, is Rodner Dangerfield, who ably mixes stand-up humour with acting and zings off the screen for all of his five or six moments.CADDYSHACK isn't an entirely successful production, and some elements are rather silly; that stupid gopher, for example, which looks like it belongs in a kid's film. But it's affectionate, it has plenty going on, and Harold Ramis does a very good job of holding it all together as director. The JAWS spoof is a definite highlight.",Caddyshack
3,SnoopyStyle,"Great master class of comedic legends, younger cast not so much",8,12 June 2014,Danny Noonan is putting everything he makes into his college fund even though he's not sure what he wants to do. He's a caddy at an exclusive Bushwood country club. The club is filled with wealthy eccentric members and an unbalanced greens keeper Carl Spackler (Bill Murray) out to get the gopher.The comedic power assembled in this is amazing. Harold Ramis made a pretty loose comedy. There're a lot of improvisations. Bill Murray really steals many scenes with all his ramblings and his gopher partner. Rodney Dangerfield and Ted Knight face off in a master class of comedy. Chevy Chase is playing the guy above it all. The weakness in the movie is the younger cast. They can't quite keep up and they pale in comparison. The movie works best with the elder statesmen Dangerfield and Ted Knight squaring off.,Caddyshack
4,mark.waltz,A tribute to the late Lois Kibbee (Mrs. Smalls),7,14 August 2003,"Lois Kibbee plays the relatively minor role of Mrs. Smalls, the snooty yet amusing wife of Judge Smalls (Ted Knight).  A veteran of several roles of society matrons on daytime soaps during the 70's and 80's, Kibbee had her only film role in this popular snobs vs. the slobs comedy which, second to ""National Lampoon's Animal House"", remains a testament of the style of comedy during the Jimmy Carter era.Best known as the lovable and somewhat mellowed Geraldine Whitney Saxon on ""The Edge of Night"", for which she received several Emmy Nominations, Kibbee took time off from that role to make this film, where she first appears in the restraunt scene with no dialogue, but a similar Geraldine look of shock that sets the standard for her character.  Of course, her character is reacting to the pass made to her by the obnoxious Rodney Dangerfield. Later, Kibbee has two key scenes of slapstick where her character domineeringly tries to get the caddys out of the country club pool and notices an object in the pool which sends the whole club into panic; The scene flashes forward and while Kibbee watches, SNL veteran Bill Murray comes in for one of the funniest pay-off scenes in film history and Kibbee's reaction is priceless.  If there were Oscars for cameos, Kibbee would have been a shoe-in for this role.Her next group of scenes surround the christening of a yacht where young Michael O'Keefe flirts with her over the amused objections of her hubby, Ted Knight; Once again, Kibbee gives the perfect reaction shot as her attempt to christen the yacht fails.  This is followed by Knight and Kibbee's return to their lavish home where O'Keefe and loose Cindy Morgan (as their niece) are about to perform the dirty deed.  Knight and O'Keefe get into it while Kibbee is taking a shower.  A shower-capped Kibbee peaks out as O'Keefe runs by in his underwear.  Her reaction of joyous surprise is another one of the subtle hysterical moments of the film, yet after this she only appears as an extra in the show's final scene.  ""Edge of Night"" fans who adored her as the formerly snobby Geraldine (based loosely originally on Rose Kennedy) were delighted by the comical way she was presented here, and later ""One Life to Live"" fans were gifted by her dramatic gifts as the evil matriarch Elizabeth Sanders.  The world of show business lost one of their true treasures in 1993 when Kibbee, who also wrote for ""The Edge of Night"" (and briefly ""Capitol""), passed away from a brain tumor.I suggest catching this film to see an amazing performance of an actress who could say more with her eyes than most do with words, than catching her on ""The World of Soap Themes"" website where an episode of ""One Life to Live"" features her in a different type of role.  Hopefully, SoapNet will eventually show re-runs of ""The Edge of Night"" where she played an older lady with the heart and love of life of a 20 year old who not only was beloved by every character on the show but by practically the entire audience as well.",Caddyshack
5,gavin6942,Classic Modern Comedy,7,11 May 2011,"An exclusive golf course has to deal with a brash new member and a destructive dancing gopher.At age 30, I have finally seen ""Caddyshack"". Growing up in the age of cable, I think it could be found on one channel or another almost every day. Other people my age have likely seen the film, or at least parts of it, at least a dozen times -- maybe fifty. And now I join the ranks, though I have no interest to make repeat viewings a habit.That might sound like I did not like it. On the contrary, it actually exceeded my expectations by quite a bit. I thought it would be dated and no longer great, but quite the opposite. Chevy Chase is in top form here, and looks great -- especially now that I am used to seeing him on ""Community"". Bill Murray is pretty much always great, and this is no exception. I was never a fan of Rodney Dangerfield (though my dad is) and here he impressed me. All in all, pretty great.The only part I did not understand was Danny's attraction to Maggie, the Scottish waitress. She has a mullet, is only average looking, has an odd voice... and then, when her pants come off, she has the worst granny panties. She is hiding nothing good under those clothes! I do not blame him at all for being attracted to the rich niece.",Caddyshack
6,lee_eisenberg,Play ball!,10,5 January 2006,"""Caddyshack"" is truly a comedy convention. Chevy Chase as the loopy owner, Bill Murray as the goofy grounds-keeper practically waging World War III against a gopher (or ""varmit"" as he calls it), and Rodney Dangerfield as an obnoxious millionaire. The movie is mostly an excuse for everyone to be silly - namely the Babe Ruth bar scene. Murray has some great lines, not only about the gopher but also his Dalai Lama monologue. I know that Ted Knight is best known for ""The Mary Tyler Moore Show"", but I will always remember him as the snobbish judge here (I've actually never seen ""TMTMS"").As it is, the movie mainly focuses on caddy Danny Noonan (Michael O'Keefe), but for me he almost becomes a back issue to everyone's gags. And it's hard to believe that Maggie was played by Sarah Holcomb (aka Clorette DePasto in ""Animal House""). A really funny movie.Varmit cong! Ha ha ha...",Caddyshack
7,jboothmillard,Caddyshack,5,20 November 2011,"This directorial debut from Ghostbusters writer/star Harold Ramis (Groundhog Day, Analyze This, Bedazzled) I had heard about and knew one of the stars, and I knew it involved golf, so I decided to give it a go. Basically at Bushwood Country Club is a popular exclusive golf course, and it is there that we see numerous workers and players on the course getting up to all sorts of antics. All the members who play are mostly wealthy, and many eccentric as well, it is only most of the staff, especially the younger ones, who are slightly less eccentric and obviously less well off. The characters include Judge Elihu Smails (Ted Knight) who is being constantly irritated by very rude and always chirpy millionaire Al Czervik (Rodney Dangerfield) who wants to buy Bushwood. Ty Webb (Chevy Chase), another big shot player on the course is meanwhile just pining around as a friend of Judge, and with the conflicts going on they are all giving young caddy Danny Noonan (Michael O'Keefe) ideas of where he should go in life. Carl Spackler (Bill Murray) is the near brainless psychopathic grounds keeper who has been given the task of eliminating all gophers who are digging around ruining the course, and he is going to great lengths to destroy them, such as pumping water through the holes, using a gun, and even explosives. The conflict between Judge and Al gets so bad that they decide to settle their differences once and for all with a match to win their right to own the club all together, to which, after explosions rumble, Al is the winner, and with the help of bruisers does get the deal done. Also starring Sarah Holcomb as Maggie O'Hooligan, Scott Colomby as Tony D'Annunzio, Cindy Morgan as Lacey Underall and Dan Resin as Dr. Beeper. I agree with the critics that the small teenage subplot is pointless and was probably only put in to draw that age audience, but Dangerfield creates an amusingly vulgar persona, Knight gets his time as his rival, Chase doesn't really do anything, and Murray steals the show creating a completely different character to his usual sorts, being the thick Elmer Fudd type hunter trying to catch the lovable pest gopher. The writing for most of the jokes is good enough, I did find enjoyment watching the chocolate bar in the swimming pool mistaken for excrement, and of course all the dangerous antics of Murray, and some of the golf playing is okay too, so while it is not all original, there are moments to like in this comedy. ""Cinderella story. Outta nowhere. A former greenskeeper, now, about to become the Masters champion. It looks like a mirac...It's in the hole! It's in the hole! It's in the hole!"" was number 92 on 100 Years, 100 Quotes, and the film was number 71 on 100 Years, 100 Laughs. Worth watching!",Caddyshack
8,ccthemovieman-1,"Would Like To Move On, But It Still Makes Me Laugh",7,5 April 2006,"This is 1970s (I'm one year off) irreverent, sleazy humor, the kind that I normally discard - the kind I thought was hilarious when I was younger. However, because of the many classic scenes in here, it's tough to get rid of because it always offers up a ton of laughs with each viewing, no matter how old I am or how many times I've seen it. But , to be honest, sometimes I do get tired of immoral characters being the good guys in post-'50s comedies.Bill Murray, as the sleazy grounds-keeper, and Ted Knight as the overbearing country club member, are the stars of the show or at the least the actors that give it spark. Chevy Chase is his usual smug self and the teens in here offer little except young bodies to show off.Wy do I sill watch this?Well, there's the famous chocolate bar scene in the pool; Murray and his ""Masters monologue,"" Rodney Dangerfield's twitches caustic remarks and the zaniness of the golf matches that make this film likable, even though it has absolutely no ""redeeming values."" The typical '70s cheap shot at religion was in there several times, totally uncalled for each time but necessary with the pagan slimes who make these films. They can't seem to retrain their hatred for anything ""religious."" For example, the only person in the film to yell out the Lord's name in vain is the reverend, who is portrayed, naturally, as a raving lunatic.Actually, as I write this I'm thinking, just as caddies have been replaced by golf carts, maybe it's time to finally replace this movie with something a little nicer , something with a little more class......but ....",Caddyshack
9,Tweekums,Classic Country Club Comedy,8,2 October 2019,"This classic from 1980 is set an exclusive country club where teenager Danny Noonan is working as a caddy to earn money to pay to go to college. Other key characters are the snobbish Judge Elihu Smails, coarse property developer Al Czervik, zen-like golf pro Ty Webb and Carl Spackler the groundskeeper who is waging war against a gopher! During the course of the film we are treated to comedy antics on the golf course, in the club house and at the local marina before a finale that features an explosive grudge match that goes to the eighteenth hole.While some have this films gags haven't aged too well it doesn't matter too much as they come thick and fast. The jokes are a more than a little crude at times but it is hard not to laugh. The cast includes several comedy stars of the time. Bill Murray is probably the most memorable as the unhinged Spackler, his increasingly extreme attempts to kill a gopher are hilarious; Rodney Dangerfield turns it up to eleven as the truly obnoxious Czervik; Ted Knight is impressive as the bigoted judge and Chevy Chase is solid if less memorable as Ty Webb. The rest of the cast is solid enough. Given when it was made it is no surprise that there is a bit of gratuitous nudity and the special effects certainly show their age. The gopher is so obviously fake it either adds to the comedy or is silly depending on one's opinion... I'm inclined to the latter. Overall I'd say this won't be for everybody but if you enjoy late '70s/early '80s comedy you need to watch it at least once.",Caddyshack
10,moonspinner55,Slob humor and high decibel insults...,2,24 August 2014,"Although not a major box-office draw in 1980, ""Caddyshack"" is now ranked as one of the funniest sports movies ever made via magazine polls (it also has Tiger Woods' endorsement to boot), and yet it's full of withered fratboy humor, with a loosely-hinged, character-driven plot that could be summed up as ""the slobs verses the snobs."" Cocky young caddy at the Bushwood Country Club gets in with the nouveau riche swells in hopes of gaining a college scholarship, but soon rebels against the blowhard boors once he's invited to participate in a winners-take-all team golf match. The main narrative, littered with useless supporting characters and a few naked babes, is so thin (and derivative besides, mostly from TV shows such as ""Saturday Night Live"") that it has to rely on a troublesome animatronic gopher to raise audience good will. Debuting director Harold Ramis (who also worked on the screenplay) doesn't have the snappy timing of, say, a John Landis (even as he hopes to ape ""Animal House"" and its ilk). The movie feels cramped and cheap, with pothead-slow pacing and various episodes that aren't shaped and don't fit together. Since humor is entirely personal--what one viewer groans at may make hundreds of others roar with laughter--there's nothing left to respond to except the merits of the production (which is sloppy) and the comedians who make up most of the cast. Chevy Chase, Bill Murray (as an unhinged groundskeeper), Ted Knight and Rodney Dangerfield are each disappointing; relying on shtick and blobby improvisation, they're just winging it. Chase, in particular, seems super-imposed on the action through some technological shortcut; he's smug, not self-assured, and has all the personality of a man acting in front of a mirror. As the randy caddy, Michael O'Keefe must have relished this comedic opportunity to lighten up from his role as Robert Duvall's son in 1979's ""The Great Santini""; his callow youthfulness, messy crop of blonde hair and deadpan sanity help him stand out from his hammy elders, but he's like Tim Matheson in ""Animal House"": the decent kid on the make, eager to be corrupted. We're supposed to cheer his corruption and take delight in the sight of the rube sticking it to the man, while Murray plants and sets off explosives during the golf match and nobody takes notice of him. Ramis has too many golf balls in the air--and they all come down unceremoniously. * from ****",Caddyshack
11,Quinoa1984,"""Hey everybody, were all gonna get laid!"" One of the best",9,22 November 2000,"caddyshack is an example of many things, hilarious (and quotable) lines, memorable characters and a hit for comic veteran stars Chevy Chase, Bill Murray (incredible as Carl), in his breakthrough film role Rodney Dangerfield (who gives the sidesplitting laughs) and for all around comic vet.

Then enters the owner of the country club (Ted Knight who gives more quotes than anyone ""How bout a fresca"" ""How'd you like to mow my lawn, huh?) who not only has to deal with him, but a real estate developer (Rodney) who wreaks havoc on the club.   No other comedy has come close to this for pure memorabilia and is the greatest golf-comedy ever beside Happy Gilore.  A+",Caddyshack
12,tavm,"Caddyshack was a fine showcase for Chase, Murray, Knight, and Dangerfield",9,29 June 2010,"So after watching Animal House and Meatballs again after so many years, I decided to rewatch this third consecutive movie co-written by Harold Ramis of which this time he also directed. I'm talking, of course, about Caddyshack which is also the third movie I'm reviewing in order that stars a member-or in this case two-of ""Saturday Night Live"". They are Chevy Chase and Bill Murray with the latter stealing many scenes as the groundskeeper who is constantly trying to rid the golf course of a gopher who likes to dance. He also fantasizes about being in the tournament and has dreams about old ladies. There's also a great scene with a bishop played by Henry Wilcoxon as he and Murray play while the rain falls down and music from The Ten Commandments (1956) is heard as the score. (Incidentally, that music not only links Wilcoxon to his previous role in that C. B. DeMille epic but that score's composer, Elmer Bernstein, links him to the previous movies I mentioned at the start of this review.) Anyway, Chase is himself witty whether counseling caddy Danny (Michael O'Keefe) on his golf swing, seducing Lacey Underall (Cindy Morgan), sharing grass with Murray, or subtly insulting Judge Smails (Ted Knight in an excellent slow burn role). Then there's the lovably obnoxious Rodney Dangerfield with his brash insults that light up every scene he's in. It's hard to believe this was only the second time he's appeared in a feature film as he's a delight throughout especially when pitted against Knight. And besides Ramis, his co-scripter from Animal House-Douglas Kenney, and Brian Doyle-Murray-Bill's brother-contributed many funny scenes and lines. By the way, Doyle-Murray, another SNL alum, also appears as an employer of the country club. And there's one more connection to Animal House: Sarah Holcomb, who was the 13-year-old cashier there, became the Irish-accented waitress who almost got pregnant by Danny here. Perhaps the weakest subplot but at least it got short shrift here. Anyway, while not perfect, Caddyshack is still one of the most hilarious comedies to come out from former SNL players during this era. P.S. I feel honored to mention fellow Chicago natives Harold Ramis, Brian Doyle-Murray and Cindy Morgan, not to mention Brian's brother Bill from nearby Wilmette, in my review. And that animatronic gopher is actually credited as being played by a ""Chuck Rodent""!",Caddyshack
13,BandSAboutMovies,Perhaps the greatest movie ever.,10,11 April 2019,"I ask you this: why did they keep making movies after Caddyshack? This is as perfect as film gets, quite literally a movie that you can drop into and out of at any time with your damage to the timing or spirit of the film. It has never failed to lift my mood or make me feel better about life. It is all that movies should endeavor to be.It's based on the memories of writer and co-star Brian Doyle-Murray as he worked as a caddy at the Indian Hill Club in Winnetka, Illinois, along with his brothers Bill and John. Director Harold Ramis had also worked as a caddy and even been hit in the genitals with a golf ball once, just like the film. Even better - that Baby Ruth candy bar in the pool came directly from Murray's high school.Is there a plot? Sure, Danny Noonan is supposedly the hero and its all about how he wants to escape his huge family and go to college. But really, it's the personalities that this movie is all about, like Ty Webb (Chevy Chase), the son of one of the club's founders who has turned slack into zen. Then there's Judge Elihu Smails (Ted Knight), who is perhaps the best bad guy ever in a comedy. Or newly rich construction boss Al Czervik (Rodney Dangerfield) who is a buffoonish man out to annoy every wealthy person in the club. And of course, there's Carl Spackler, the groundskeeper who is at war with a gopher.It's also the only movie where Chase and Murray appear in a scene together. Famously brawling on the set of Saturday Night Live once, where Murray referred to Chase as ""medium talent"" before punching him - the best insult ever - they got along here and wrote a quick moment where Ty's golf ball ends up in Spackler's ramshackle hovel.Murray dialogue in the film is completely unscripted, including his Cinderella story scene. There, he was told only to act as if he were a child announcing his own imaginary golf moment. He was only on set for six days.The constant improv really bothered Knight, an actor who prided himself on knowing his lines. Dangerfield never did the same take twice, so their constant battling has its roots in reality. In fact, Rodney would never begin doing anything when Ramis yelled ""Action!"" Instead, he had to be told, ""Rodney, do your bit.""The original cut of this film was around 4 and a half hours with Bill Murray's Cinderella speech coming in at around half an hour. No one was happy with the second cut, so the gopher was added at the last minute to give the movie some structure. It was shot on a soundstage, so that's why the film stock in these scenes looks completely different.Caddyshack was a failure upon release and was hated by critics. It's gone on to show them all the error of their ways.Sadly, writer Doug Kenney would never see this movie be embraced. At the press conference for this film, he drunkenly yelled at reporters, convinced it would be the end of his Hollywood career. A trip soon after to Hawaii with Chase lifted his spirits, but only for a brief time. He either slipped on a rock or jumped while there and was dead at 33, leaving behind work with the National Lampoon and the film Animal House along with this one. You can learn more about Kenney in the movie A Futile and Stupid Gesture.",Caddyshack

15,hitchcockthelegend,"Au revoir Gopher!,",7,17 June 2012,"Caddyshack is directed by Harold Ramis who also co-writes the screenplay with Douglas Kenney and Brian Doyle-Murray. It stars Chevy Chase, Rodney Dangerfield, Bill Murray, Ted Knight and Michael O'Keefe. Music is by Johnny Mandel and cinematography by Stevan Larner.Chaos reigns at Bushwood Country Club when egos, wagers and a Gopher surface on the golf course.Harold Ramis' debut movie is a pretty plot less affair that rises above this fact to entertain royally whilst providing a stage for the likes of Murray and Dangerfield to strut their defining shtick. Suffice to say that one needs to be enamoured with said artists to fully enjoy the picture, whilst a modicum of golf interest also helps. The youthful caddies of the piece, clearly meant to be at the core of the story, struggle to make headway with such boisterousness around them, but the chaos is finely tuned by Ramis and there's something uniquely funny about watching someone like Murray trying to blow up a disco dancing Gopher! An acquired taste but also a monster hit back in the day, Caddyshack is frayed around the edges and a little too goofy at times. But when it hits its comedy peak, visually and orally, it's not hard to get wrapped up in the chaos and find the laughs lurching out from the belly. 7/10",Caddyshack

Murray is just horrible as the grounds keeper--not even remotely funny, just dull. Also the gopher he's chasing is shown by one of the stupidest puppets I've ever seen.

17,Boba_Fett1138,A comedy without a point and or even plot...what is there not to love?!,8,24 October 2006,"This is a typical silly comedy from the early '80's. The movie is basically filled with numerous humorous situations and crazy characters, without ever really making an attempt to make things click to each other in the movie or letting it make sense. Sounds like an awfully simple and lame comedy and it's its core it actually of course is. Yet the movie works perfectly thanks to the superb comedy cast, who all are in great form. Basically the movie follows three main plot lines, set on and around a golf course. First there is the caddy Danny Noonan (Michael O'Keefe) who tries to get a scholarship and deals with girl problems, among other things. Then there is Carl Spackler (Bill Murray) who has to hunt and kill a gopher that is ruining the green. And then there's the plot with Judge Elihu Smails (Ted Knight) and Al Czervik (Rodney Dangerfield), who are constantly battling each other, on and off the golf course. But in all fairness, those plot lines are just an excuse to introduce many eccentric characters and letting them do many crazy things. There actually are many subplots in the movie but this movie is all about its characters and comical situations.It's obvious that they improvised a lot during this movie, with its characters, situations and dialog. Even if there was a complete script, it was abandoned multiple times throughout the movie. It's sort of part of the charm of ""Caddyshack"". Of course as always, especially Bill Murray does great in the improvised sequences.The story often doesn't really make sense and it doesn't even try to do so. The movie is filled with totally pointless sequences that are only put in for the laughs, not for the story or the flow of it. Best example of this is the ""Jaws"" spoof sequence. The same goes for most of the characters. The movie doesn't try to make sense, so the gloves are of and there is no holding back. It provides the movie with some absolutely priceless humor and dialog at times. The humor is totally crazy. It's over-the-top and at times also quite vulgar. Guess you have to appreciate the lame mindless and pointless humor of '70's and '80's movie to fully enjoy this movie.The characters are really the reason why this comedy works as such an highly amusing and funny one. All of the characters are eccentric to put it mildly. It definitely helps that most of the characters are being played by very talented comedy actors. Normally I'm not a big Chevy Chase fan but in this movie he was just perfect. Bill Murray is crazy as always and perhaps in this movie even crazier than all of the other characters in this movie combined. Really amusing was also Rodney Dangerfield in a totally crazy and over-the-top role, with some great comical dialog from his character. He provides some of the biggest laughs of the movie.A comedy that I just never grow tired of.8/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",Caddyshack

20,Aaron1375,Great comedy that they just don't make anymore.,9,29 January 2004,"One thing surprised me when I looked up this movie is that I did not know Harold Ramis co wrote and directed this movie.  So you learn something new every day.  This movie is very funny all the way through, a rarity these days.  Usually, comedies now have to either have a stretch of being sentimental, or they just do toilet humor the whole way through, or you have to watch fifteen other movies just to get the jokes.  This one stands on its own merit and it is funny throughout.  The caddies are the central part of the movie.  They aren't really the main part, but the bulk of the story goes through them.  They are also the least funny part of the movie, not to say they don't have their moments (Bill Murray did caddy, but I look at him more as a grounds keeper).  The cast is great, but for my money the two funniest guys are Bill Murray and Rodney Dangerfield.  Bill's character is very funny as I love the scene with him and the priest and Dangerfield plays a wild guy who disrupts the everyday workings of the country club where this one is set.  Ted Knight is also good as a man who grows increasingly agitated by Dangerfield's presence.  There is somewhat of a plot there, but it does go here and there and that is all right with me.  There is also a pesky gopher, which sets up another great joke with Bill and the Scottish guy when Bill misunderstands him and this movie also made a floating Baby Ruth candy hysterical as well (another good scene with Murray).  Chevy Chase is in this one as well, and while he does okay he doesn't stand out like the others I have mentioned.",Caddyshack
21,Wuchakk,Zany carry-ons at an exclusive golf course,6,23 January 2018,"RELEASED IN 1980 and directed by Harold Ramis, ""Caddyshack"" is a comedy about a high-class golf course that has to deal with a colorful new member (Rodney Dangerfield) and a destructive dancing gopher. Ted Knight and Chevy Chase play high society golfers while Bill Murray plays the half-mad assistant greenskeeper in charge of taking out the menacing gopher. Michael O'Keefe and Scott Colomby appear as young caddies while Cindy Morgan and Sarah Holcomb are featured in the female department.This is a fun movie with a classic cast, a kinetic soundtrack (e.g. Kenny Loggins) and a can't-beat-it late 70s/early 80's ambiance. Both Dangerfield and Knight are over-the-top. They're more entertaining than funny though. Chase plays it more low-key while Murray is decidedly bizarre. Morgan shines in her most famous role, but don't expect much more on the female front. The gopher steals the show. THE FILM RUNS 98 minutes and was shot in Florida (Davie, Boca Ratan, Fort Lauderdale & Key Biscayne) and the Los Angeles area (e.g. Woodland Hills Country Club).

23,Mr-Fusion,Actually makes golf a watchable sport,8,20 July 2015,"You mention ""Caddyshack"" and you're talking about one of the great '80s comedies. Its humor ranging from sexy to scatological, this is some finely-tuned lowbrow material. And it just works. What's funny is that this is supposed to be Michael O'Keefe's story, but the movie's hijacked by the comic veterans (Chase, Dangerfield and Murray). The real brilliance of this movie is seeing the ad-lib ripcord being pulled on Bill Murray and watching him go. That stuff about the Dalai Lama is gold! The cake's icing is the lovely (and nude) Cindy Williams, not to mention the gopher. Between the one-liner factory, bawdy humor and a Kenny Loggins pop song, it's a recipe for success.8/10",Caddyshack
24,namashi_1,A Good Laugh!,7,5 February 2015,"'Caddyshack' Co-Written & Directed by none other than the Late/Great Harold Ramis, is a good laugh! Despite it being crude & also juvenile at times, this 1980 comedy hit is more a riot, than a notorious ham! 'Caddyshack' Synopsis: An exclusive golf course has to deal with a brash new member and a destructive dancing gopher. 'Caddyshack' explores many characters, under one golf course. There are all crazy & their journey together as one, is nothing but a wholesome, over-the-top, zany ride, where being offensive is just the beginning. Ramis, Douglas Kenney & Brian Doyle-Murray's Screenplay isn't hilarious all through, but for the most bits, its one joyride! Ramis's Direction is perfectly done. Cinematography & Editing are average.Performance-Wise: Ted Knight & Rodney Dangerfield, sadly both deceased now, are impeccably rude & funny. Bill Murray is a hoot! This guy could make anything funny! Michael O'Keefe is very sincere. But the show-stealer here is Chevy Chase. The Comedic Legend delivers a performance that's truly slapstick & poker-faced.On the whole, Laughter is never bad for your health & hence 'Caddyshack' needs to be watched.",Caddyshack
25,StevePulaski,Makes me tee'd off at new films,8,18 August 2011,"Golf was never as funny until the 1980's comedy classic Caddyshack was released. We always frown or roll our eyes when we see golf on one of our local channels, hogging the time for three or more hours. Then we think to this comedy and laugh. If Caddyshack can make a dull sport like golf funny, I'm waiting for Queballs or even Strikes to bring some excitement to the world of billiards or bowling.Caddyshack has an all-star comedy cast, but they seem to work best on the green rather than at dinner or out in the world. Bill Murray, Ted Knight, Chevy Chase, and Rodney Dangerfield are the funniest in this film when they are making snarky remarks at each other while trying to enjoy a game of golf, a game that is known for its calming, stress-free nature. The problem, is Caddyshack tries to concoct a love story between multiple groups and keeps trying to nudge its characters off the field. When you have a good cast that works well in a designated area why shun them away from that area? I would've been perfectly content with a movie that where more than half of it takes place on a golf course. Just as long as it featured the comedic talents of these four guys.There really is no plot either. Just well-developed characters that sustain the entire movie. There's Ty (Chase) the most laidback person in the world. Carl (Murray) the grounds-keeper of the course who spends most of the film trying to exterminate a pesky gopher who distracts other players. Al (Dangerfield) a rich real estate cad who does nothing but boast the whole film in his vulgar, yet undeniably hilarious ways. And, finally, Judge Elihu Smails (Knight) the co-founder of the course.If you take four parrots, caged them up for days without letting them out, then released them in a room with each other they would go nuts and frolic forever. That's exactly what Chase, Dangerfield, Knight, and Murray. They unleash each one of their special qualities out on the film. Which is what makes Caddyshack so funny and so memorable. It's quotable because of many comedic parties, and entertaining because their antics are unpredictable.This is one of the more subtle spoof films of all time. Caddyshack isn't marketed as a parody film, but it does bring comedic jokes about the game of golf and just makes it funny in its entirety. It doesn't go on a rampage trying to get as many references in as possible, but it winds up accomplishing more than any modern day spoof.If the Direct-to-DVD National Lampoon series now among us took time to pay closer attention to ""worthless"" things like writing, casting, and humor, they could maybe pull off something like Caddyshack. Instead, they choose the easy way out by putting some bikini girl on the DVD cover hoping people will see this as an American Pie raunch-fest, when really, it's PG-13, and if it is R rated, it has very little to offer.Caddyshack doesn't try to hard and it still succeeds. The inspiration is the four leads who each make up a small part of a very successful film. It has no limits, no regrets, no mercy, and no shame.Starring: Bill Murray, Rodney Dangerfield, Chevy Chase, and Ted Knight. Directed by: Harold Ramis.",Caddyshack
26,Smells_Like_Cheese,The most boring sport on Earth is becoming some of the funniest comedies ever,7,23 November 2007,"I saw Caddyshack on Bravo's 100 Funniest Movies, and it was really up there in the top three. But when I asked my mom if she saw it, she said it was highly over rated, then I asked my movie buddy if she saw it, she also said that she found it over rated. But I decided to go ahead and check it out myself, just see if I would like it or not. I rented it and watched the movie last night, while I do agree that it is slightly over rated, I still thought that this was a funny comedy. For me, Rodney definitely brought life to the movie, without him, I think the movie would have just been average. I know some people find him annoying, but he was just so funny in this film, I loved his out fits and crazy love for life was just so great. Also Bill Murray, I don't see too many movies where he is more funny than obnoxious, but he and the gopher was just classic. Golfing is becoming the funniest sport ever.Danny and his co-workers are caddy's, they have a blast when they're on break. But Danny wants a life outside his family and city, so he is going for a scholarship where if he's a great caddy, he could win it. So he starts getting in with the big time golfers. He's slowly getting into their good graces. But he also meets the more lively golfers, who are less snobby and actually enjoy life. But they decide that the older and more stuffy golfers need to get their butts kicked and should leave the course, they're ready to party down with the sport.Caddyshack is really funny at times, like I said, I think the story that got me most was the battle between Bill Murray and the gopher, it was so stupid that it just went from dumb to funny. The gopher did look very fake and corny, but it's all good. I would recommend Caddyshack if you are looking for a few laughs, I did enjoy it. When it comes to top comedies, I'm still debating if this should've made the top three on Bravo's top funniest movies, but it's all good, it's other people's opinions. Just check it out for yourself and try not to think of those who over blow how funny it is.7/10",Caddyshack
27,DKosty123,Classic Golf Comedy by Great Cast - A Hole in One,8,22 August 2006,"Get that critter off the course & make room for a great comedy. This film has it all- from Chevy Chase, Bill Murray, & Rodney Dangerfield all providing great performances to Ted Knight in his best movie role as a straight man to Rodney. While this film has developed some political correctness problems now due to some R rated materials which are not as acceptable today as they were in 1980, the film & it's players rise above that to a great comedy level. I only wish Ted Knight& Rodney Dangerfield could have teamed up some more in their careers. While Chase & Murray are great in this film, it is these Ted & Rodney playing off each other that puts this film over the top on entertainment value. There is plenty of verbal & visual comedy in this film which makes it great too. It plays off several themes & comes off as a great time. The reason I say Ted & Rodney are the glue is that if you watch the sequel, CADDYSHACK 2 with Jackie Mason & Robert Stack trying to do Ted & Rodney's roles & compare it with this original, you will find while the second one failed where this one succeeded. The soundtrack is good but the music is more for rock fans. The main weakness in this original is the love story between the young folks which is a throwback to this type of story distraction in MARX BROTHERS films. Luckily, this film never stops for too long on this subplot. Just remember the folks in this cast & some great classic comedy are what you watching this film for.

Blue collar rich guy Rodney Dangerfield joins the upper crust at the Bushwood County club, and the banter and ensuing adventures keep me laughing every time. Each big name was hired to do what they do best- dangerfield for his blatant, outrageous truth. Chevy Chase for the low key, clever, slightly offbeat humor. Ted Knight as the ""Judge Smails"" for the prim and proper self he just cant get over (starting with Mary Tyler Moore show, he played this part over & over... Too Close for Comfort TV show) and of course, Bill Murray is the lowly buffoon that means well, but always finds trouble. Great play between the characters... it must have been a fun movie to make. Love the boat christening scene - Great poetry!

29,Rainey-Dawn,Comedy At It's Funniest,10,27 October 2014,This is such a wonderful comedy. At the time this movie came (1980) there were some funny movies but Caddyshack may have been the King of Comedy films that year. The only other comedy film that was could have stolen the crown of comedy in the year 1980 from Caddyshack was the movie Airplane!. Both movies are superb! Caddyshack does contain some of the funniest lines and sight gags that you will ever see. I never knew that golfing could be so much fun! Yes Caddyshack is worth watching - it's an older film but it is a top-of-the-line 1980 comedy classic. If Caddyshack does not get you laughing out loud then I do not know what other film would.10/10,Caddyshack

31,sddavis63,Mark Twain's Line About Golf Works Here,2,7 January 2009,"Jon Peters - the executive producer of Caddyshack - said that ""golfers love this movie."" I can't argue that point for a moment. My father-in-law is a golfer and he loves this movie, and loaned us the DVD to watch it. Unfortunately, I am not a golfer. I lean to the Mark Twain school of thought on the game - ""golf is a nice walk ruined."" Needless to say, I did not love this movie.The best thing I can say about it is that Rodney Dangerfield is only part of an ensemble cast rather than the actual star. That meant that his typical crude, buffoonish character didn't have as much time to grate on me as in some of the movies he's actually starred in (think ""My 5 Wives."") In the time he was on screen he still grated as real estate developer Al Czervik. Three primary subplots very loosely held together what there was of a story here - groundskeeper Carl's (Bill Murray) attempts to dispose of a pesky gopher who's tearing up the greens (the fake gopher also grated on me); caddy Danny's (Michael O'Keefe) attempts to suck up to Judge Smails (Ted Knight) in order to gain a scholarship to university (maybe he should have worked harder in high school?) and the bet between Czervik and Smails. Chevy Chase was also included here as a sort of new age golf ace. The cast didn't blow me away. Dangerfield I've commented on. Murray's work was probably the best in an undemanding role and Chase wasn't bad. O'Keefe was OK. Knight seemed to keep falling into his Ted Baxter persona from the Mary Tyler Moore show. Thinking back to Mark Twain - this movie was a potentially nice 99 minutes ruined! And to think this spawned a sequel! Obviously there are a lot of golfers getting too much sun! 2/10",Caddyshack
32,g-bodyl,Mostly Funny!,8,5 February 2015,"Caddyshack for the most part is a funny screwball comedy that began the train ride of comedies that would highlight the 1980s. I am not too fond of golf so actually enjoying the film came as a surprise to me. Some jokes just tried to hard, but other jokes had me laughing through the roof. My favorites are the gopher scenes and the scene spoofing Jaws with a candy bar in the pool.Harold Ramis's film has many subplots to the story. There is Danny, a caddy for a golf course who wants to go to college so he tries to win a scholarship. There is the assistant groundskeeper named Carl who tries to eliminate a gopher. There is a new member named Al who is crazy and constantly angers one of the founders, Judge Smails. There is also this talented golfer named Ty, who Danny regularly caddies for.The acting is pretty good I think. Chevy Chase did a swell job as Ty. Laid-back, but pretty funny. Rodney Dangerfield was hilarious as Al. Michael O'Keefe was pretty good as Danny. I thought Bill Murray was the highlight as the man trying to kill the gopher without such luck.Overall, Caddyshack is actually a pretty good film. There are more funny moments than not, although not every joke works. It works as a good sports spoof and I'm just glad it's not a straight-up golf movie. This movie is heralded as a cult classic and I can see why. This film almost works as a stand-up comedy show, which is not bad at all. I rate this film 8/10.",Caddyshack

34,CuriosityKilledShawn,"If you love this film, when you die, on your deathbed, you will receive total consciousness",10,14 November 2000,"So now you've got that going for you, which is nice.Inspired by Brian Doyle-Murray's experiences as a caddy in his youth, this wild, anarchic film is about more than just golf. Without a doubt, it's my favorite comedy, and might even be one of the greatest movies of all time. There is not a single scene without comedic chaos.Director Harold Ramis is barely able to contain the insanity. There is honestly so much in Caddyshack, there's enough for ten movies, hardly surprising since the first draft of the screenplay was 199 pages long while the first cut of the film run for 310 minutes. I imagine that there's enough cut out to make whole new Caddyshack movies. There are about five different plots developing at once throughout the movie, the funniest of which is Carl Spackler's (having been licensed to kill by the 'Government of the United Nations') attempts to assassinate a rogue gopher tearing up the golf course.Each and every actor battles with each other, and it's hard to nail down exactly who runs away with the movie, but if I absolutely HAD to choose, I'd say that Rodney Dangerfield's sleazy, slobbish, overly-friendly, and gratuitously tipping character is the most wonderful thing about it. He is the perfect foil for Judge Smails (an utterly perfectly-cast Ted Knight), a pompous, bad-tempered, self-important hypocrite who wants to reserve the pretentious Bushwood Country Club for snobs and gentlemen (despite being far from a gentleman himself).If you like comedy quotes, Caddyshack is a goldmine. There are hundreds, literally hundreds, of lines worthy of repeating in real life. You could literally get by, from cradle to the grave, just quoting Caddyshack, and it would bring you nothing but pure happiness and good fortune.",Caddyshack

36,johnnyboyz,A charming little sports comedy,6,19 January 2006,"It's a shame that the genre of sport when it comes to film isn't as exploited as much as it perhaps should be. Often, the clichés can come thick and fast when it comes to narrative and the characters involved; such as 'the underdog' and the 'underdog always winning in the end', so after seeing this, it was pleasing to see a film that steered clear of this and took a completely different direction when approaching the genre.The multi-strand storyline is cute to say the least. On one side, you've got the tension building up between an elderly golfer and a new member of the club who is a lot richer and a lot louder and as a result, is seen as more of a rival than a fellow member. On the other side, you have a rather bizarre yet amusing at times sub-plot involving the unforgettable Bill Murray as an obsessed green keeper attempting to annihilate a pesky gopher terrorising the course. Throw a love story into the mix and you've got a film. The dialogue and acting really flows out of the actors, especially Bill Murray's character in a number of different scenes and on a number of different occasions. Everything from the discovery that it was only, after all, a chocolate bar in the pool to the now famous 'Cinderella Story' monologue.Rodney Dangerfield's character is another who benefits from the amusing script as he goes around breaking every single rule (not just golf rules) in particularly funny fashion. One scene during an evening dinner/party when he gives his own personal opinion about each guest in a rather outgoing manner is particularly memorable. Chevy Chase's character is also good value as the rather bland but open-minded doctor who can shoot a below par round without caring too much, he also eats off the script which springs to life at clever moments.On the down side, despite the quaint little narrative, there is never much of a plot. Although this is dominantly a golf/sporting orientated film, there is never really an atmosphere of sports nor is there much tension as the opposing sides in the form of the rich old men at the club attempts to build up. The reason behind this is that with Bill Murray's characters sub-plot inter-cutting now and again, the comic relief distinguishes any atmosphere we might previously have felt.The film also seems to hover around on young caddie 'Danny' as he deals with life at the golf club and seems forever chasing his own personal 'American Dream' which, although when compared to all the other characters' aims is a lot more long term, it just seems to weigh the film down in a rather strange way as any scene with Danny, you feel isn't particularly important as the real stories/comic interest are lying with most of the characters. This slows the film down slightly but there is enough of everything else to keep it interesting until the final match, which actually seems quite tame itself until the little twist you eventually see building up during the game.I think you'll enjoy this film in places and depending on your mood whilst you watch this, there's a high chance you'll like it overall.",Caddyshack
37,leplatypus,"A comedy about golfers, gofers & gophers (web)",7,16 October 2017,"And also one in which Murray has already problems with small, kind furry burrowers I pick this one thinking that having in the same picture, Chevy, Murray and Ramis should be great and if it's indeed the result, the previous meeting is a bit disappointing and Chevy is not that funny here! On the other hand, Murray is really good playing a bit the future groundskeeper Willie from the Simpsons! In addition, I'm amazed to see that his brother looks then like his twin, as much physically as with his attitudes! Beyond the duo, this is a fine comedy that actually makes laugh, a genre that has disappeared from today American screens and this movie is easy to understand why While America has always denied social classes, claiming that everyone is equal but some are motivated (the rich) while others are lazy (the poor), this movie clearly illustrates that there are indeed 2 different worlds: the privileged one and the one of the common people.. So here the entire movie is about a very select, elitist golf club and while the rich play or fight as hobbies, the poor are actually working as their helping hands So because there is no better sharp contrast that this one, the movie sure finds a lot of interesting characters and things to do! In addition, the movie has still the look, the coolness of the 70s and again, the difference with today is clear!

In the comedy contest between Murray, Chase, and Dangerfield, let me just say that Chase does not win.  Dangerfield is at his best, delivering his classic lines (""this meat's so tough you can see where the jockey was riding it"") with ultimate panache and actually playing his crazy character (reminiscent of Peter Sellars in ""The Party"") to the hilt.  Murray is really the show-stopper, though, muttering his lines to give them emphasis (?) and racing around the course with what appears to be real mania.

39,Anonymous_Maxine,Get drunk first.,5,13 January 2005,"There are several classic comedies that, at the time of this writing, I've never seen, like Animal House, Groundhog Day, and, until yesterday, Caddyshack. Maybe I just expected more, but I found Caddyshack to be pretty disappointing. The only funny people in the movie are Chevy Chase and Rodney Dangerfield, and the latter only sporadically. Rodney Dangerfield has this style of comedy that is brilliant in stand-up, but in a film it is not very conducive to repeat viewings. His style is too spontaneous to be funny more than once or twice, but was still funnier in this movie by leaps and bounds than Bill Murray, who turned in an astonishingly unamusing performance.A lot of times I find myself unable to sufficiently appreciate these goofball comedies, because when they reach the level of cult classic that this movie has, I really expect them to be side-splittingly hilarious, which Caddyshack simply is not. On the other hand, I think my sense of humor has matured beyond the ability to fully appreciate the crude humor for which 80s comedies are often so well known, so maybe I'm wrong (note: I'm not wrong).Structurally, the movie is very well made. When it ultimately gets around to the real conflict in the movie rather than concentrating on the stupid clash between the drunken teen caddies and the snooty rich folk that populate the curiously named Bushwood Country Club, there is some genuine tension created. Bill Murray plays a groundskeeper caricature (replacing groundskeeper Willie, who showed up in the beginning of the movie and then promptly and inexplicably disappeared completely) who is assigned by the club's owner to get rid of the gophers that have somehow made it onto the golf course and proceeded to tear huge ruts into the putting greens. Murray's role for the rest of the movie is to plot huge military vengeance against the offending gopher, who really only wants to listen to good music and get his groove on. I'm not sure whose talent is more wasted, Murray's or the gopher's.I've found recently that watching any documentaries provided with the DVDs almost invariably makes me appreciate the movie more. I liked this movie much more after I watched the cast and crew talking about their experiences in making it, much as my appreciation was lifted by similar documentaries for movies like Willard and Texas Chainsaw III, which had nowhere to go but up anyway.What I can't get over, though, is how funny Caddyshack is not. It's not that the comedy flew below my radar, so to speak, but that there is really not much effort put into making it funny. If the making-of documentary is to be believed (although I have a feeling that this was said as a joke), the screenplay was originally intended to be a drama, but not much of what was in the script ever made it into the final film. If that's true, my theory is that it was the dancing mechanical gopher that turned it from a drama into a comedy. Whatever the case, Caddyshack turned out to be one of the most famous comedies ever made, although in my opinion, not even close to one of the best.",Caddyshack

Yet this film managed to do it very well because of what the characters do on and off the course.Yeah, the film has this plotline on a underdog caddy that has big dreams of going to Law School and is trying to find a better way to get there. It's really not that important, it's a cliché plotline that by it's nature is really a closed line for the comedy. It's really what those other characters do we all pay attention to and is what the film is most concerned about.The music is great this film has some of the best songs once again from Kenny Logins whom always seemed to supply a song or too for a film in the 80's. 
The judge Elihu Smalls by Ted Knight he's a good villain that you love to dislike as he's a snobby dirtbag that despite the accumulation of his wealth can't seem to afford integrity. He's deep down is a person that has a small man complex, hence his last name. He's always trying way too hard at being at the top of everyone else, from social status to just being well liked which he really isn't despite not knowing it.However, the big three in this film are who make the film for me. 
The late great Rodney Dangerfield as Al Czervik this is my favorite role from him. What I really love about his character is the fact that despite being rich, he doesn't act like a stereotypical snob or upper-class blowhole. He's a person that just wants to be himself and have a good time as well as go against the grain, he never cares about what anyone else thinks. From how he dresses wearing a lot of loud t-shirts and not wearing the traditional suit or whatever else golfers and upper classmen wear. He has a flamboyant person where he's not afraid of expressing himself as well as doing whatever he feels like doing. His character just has a lot of the best lines and moments, my favorite is the boat scene where he has a yaut and is coming to the Judge whom has a sail boat that looks flimsy, unfortunately Al doesn't know how to drive it very well and as you can see a lot of hilarity follows.Chevy Chase is good as Ty Webb, he's dryly funny. He's sort of a calm laid back golfer though you see is a bit self-involved and in some spots, he's sort of a slacker at heart. But I like that he really is a friendly guy he's helpful to the caddy giving him some philosophy on life (ok, not always the best kind but hey whatever works) and he likes to play Golf for fun which that what I like doing to. What's really funny is how in the third half of the film when he gets into the tournament we see he's a little nervous which makes his Karma's a bit imbalanced as we see him starting to make some strange spectacular blunders in his skill like shooting a ball straight though a birds beak; on the bright side that would be considered one of the best if strangest shots in golf history.Bill Murray is great as Carl Spackler he's easily my favorite of the three, this was one of his first role and it's deffenatly one of his best. I really like how slobby, crazy and offbeat he is. He has a strange tone to his voice where it's a sounds like a combination of calm, stupidity, and lunacy; His plotline is a live action Looney Tunes where he has to hunt down and kill this rather smart Gopher. I really like that Gopher whom is the mascot of the whole film; he so cute, really like the puppeteering giving the Golfer some personality. As for Bill he just has some of the best darn lines and scenes in the film, from pretending to be a pro golfer by whacking some flowers and announcing the Cinderella Man story to himself. But just his antics in trying to kill the Gopher when he announces his plain at blowing away the golfer it's just comic gold.Caddyshack is on par with hilarity.Rating: 4 stars",Caddyshack
42,Polaris_DiB,Worth a rental and some memories,5,21 September 2008,"I finally got around to seeing this well-known comedy classic. It turns out the whole Murray-vs-animatronic-gopher thing is only a small fraction of the overall comedy, which was interesting because actually the movie skips and hops over various different comedic forms on purpose, providing a somewhat well rounded, somewhat flawed sketch comedy.Bill Murray is the foul-mouthed, creepy groundskeeper presenting some of the gross-out comedy. Rodney Dangerfield is Al Czervick, successful realty investor, mixes things up with the characters with his screwball comedy. Chevy Chase is the dry-humored zen golfer. Ted Knight is ""Caddyshack""'s attempt at making fun of The Man. Michael O'Keefe is the young kid providing the movie some character to get behind, and Cindy Morgan plays Lacey Underall (nice name, right?), the sex comedy aspect of the movie. They meet and play golf. There are fights, bets, gunfire, and explosions.I don't think ""Caddyshack"" has aged all that well over time. Sexed up raunchy comedy has just gotten dirtier over the years, leaving most of ""Caddyshack"" behind in the dust. The story doesn't flow all too well, trudging along scene by scene and often getting distracted by some other anecdote to tell. Each character seems kind of like they came out of their own comedy and were lumped together for a ""best of"" skit. However, some of the more drab and dry comedy, especially coming from Chevy Chase as Ty, but also with the attempts of young Danny to get the Judge's attentions for a future he doesn't even want, not only hold up well but give this movie legs to last a bit longer. I can't say it has all that much rewatchability, though.--PolarisDiB",Caddyshack

Rodney Dangerfield and Chevy Chase are in the zone throughout, milking their most famous traits for all they're worth, while Bill Murray is largely wasted as the brain-dead burnout on the trail of a muppet gopher. A few iconic scenes from this one still linger in the public lexicon, like the wrapper-free Baby Ruth floating in the swimming pool or Chase's zen tee-box mantra of ""nanananana."" Close examination of the plot reveals dozens of holes, an almost complete lack of risk to the main players and a misplaced focus... but that's not really the point. A joyously carefree approach to filmmaking, it was quite clearly a non-stop party that just so happened to commit 98 minutes of semi-coherent story to film. Some punchlines may have lost their edge over time, but those that haven't are surefire winners; enough to make up for the very dated general atmosphere.",Caddyshack
46,st-shot,Caddy Shack nearly breaks par.,6,11 May 2011,"After writing the enormously popular Animal House director John Ramis sat in the director's chair for the first time and wisely allowed Bill Murray and Rodney Dangerfield to do their own thing in this uneven comedy about Country Club swells and employees. There's plenty of funny in Caddy Shack but plenty of bogey making as well.The members of the club led by Ted Knight's pompous Judge Smails are predictable clichés while the frat house has been moved to the links to accommodate the animal class of 1980. Wading into a morass of diversionary minor plots and idol chatter Bill and Rodney tear the place up with their genuine brand of irreverence. Groundskeeper Murray acting and looking like he's taken a fair share of nine irons to the head delivers more than half of the films funniest moments particularly while destroying flower beds with a driver and delivering play by play. Dangerfield gathers up most of the remaining laughs by showing no respect for the snobbish members. Chevy Chase as the club pro is a smarmy waste and the rest of the cast verbose extras. Caddy Shack is clearly a two man show, everything else ends up in the sand trap.",Caddyshack
47,snoozejonc,Hasn't aged well,5,7 September 2020,"A series of comedy sketches involving a number of characters that work and play at the Bushwood Country Club.The movie plays off the Animal House theme of rebellious characters crudely sticking it to stiff shirted authority figures. Where better to do that than in a country club golf course with a series of loosely connected improvised sketches?It seemed very funny when I was a child and a young teenager, but less so now. For me Chevy Chase in this is moderately funny as the rich playboy golfer, Bill Murray is mostly wasted as the greenskeeper and Rodney Dangerfield's one liners rarely work. The only sketches I still enjoy are the chocolate bar in the swimming pool and the scene where Murray and Chase bond in the shed.I was a child of the 80s and loved a variety of comedies from the era, particularly the ones starring the Saturday Night Live alumni such as Blues Brothers, Animal House, Vacation, Three Amigos, Spies Like Us, Dragnet and many others.
I admire the performers for what they produced off the cuff, but unlike the ones mentioned above, as a feature film, I don't think Caddyshack stands the test of time.",Caddyshack
48,dworldeater,"Not the best movie, but still funny",6,28 May 2020,"I can honestly say with an adult rewatch that I didn't like this as much as I did when I was a kid. Even so, for comedy Caddy shack is an important movie with the comic toure de force of Chevy Chase, Rodney Dangerfield and Bill Murray at the beginning stages of their film careers, as well as the directorial debut of Harold Ramis. With all these major players, that is a good enough reason to be so highly regarded. I do think that as a whole the movie is funny and making this was a 3 month long constant party for the cast and crew. A lot of the jokes and humor are a bit dated, and Caddyshack is very cheesy. However, with all it's flaws, our all star ensemble comic super cast is very likeable and the natural charisma of these legends shines through. Although, I think Caddy shack is highly dated and a little overrated, for it's time it was innovative and it's nice to see these comic legends together in this wild 80's comedy.",Caddyshack
49,PredragReviews,Good Memories of 80's,6,2 May 2016,"""Caddyshack"" was Harold Ramis' first job in the director's chair, and it shows: the tension is slack, there is far too much improvisation, and there's a lack of focus both in narrative and theme. Caddyshack features fine performances from Bill Murray, Rodney Dangerfield, Chevy Chase, Ted Knight, and of course, the gopher. This motion picture is replete with sight gags and one-liners that to this day are repeated by aficionados of clever satire. As far as the improv goes, one gets the sense that Chase, Dangerfield, and even Murray just sort of steamrolled Ramis. I'm sure it was a fun set to be on perhaps too much fun.I can see that the jokes are mostly lame, the subplots are predictable and the acting rarely rises above the adequate. But I still can't help laughing like a drain whenever I watch it. You don't have to be a lowbrow to like this movie, and just because you think it's funny doesn't mean there's something wrong with you. Caddyshack and Animal House withstand the test of time as two of the funniest comedies ever made... and that stands for a lot! Overall rating: 6 out of 10.",Caddyshack
50,sme_no_densetsu,A bona-fide comedy classic,8,30 January 2008,"Following the success of ""National Lampoon's Animal House"" a couple of years earlier Harold Ramis and Doug Kenney struck comedy gold a second time with this classic that once again pitted the slobs against the snobs.The cast is dynamite. Chevy Chase was at the top of his game as zen golfer Ty Webb, Bill Murray was equally memorable as demented assistant greens-keeper Carl Spackler, the one and only Rodney Dangerfield basically played himself with predictably hilarious results and rounding it out was Ted Knight, who effortlessly oozed smarm.The storyline is rambling but that doesn't matter much. It's the jokes and the interplay between the actors that fuels the movie. It was no surprise to learn that there was a lot of improvisation going on on the set. The sole scene shared by Chevy Chase & Bill Murray is sheer genius through and through. Still, a more coherent story would have benefited the film.There is one thing I'm not crazy about, though, and that is the music. 'Songs by Kenny Loggins' doesn't have the same ring today as it did about thirty years ago. That being said, ""I'm Alright"" isn't bad. I do wish, however, that the filmmakers had gotten Elmer Bernstein to handle the music like he did for ""Animal House"".In the end, I give the all-around edge to the precursor, ""Animal House"", but this one is a worthy successor. Too bad Doug Kenney didn't live to see the end of the year or we might have seen more comedies of this caliber during the '80s.",Caddyshack
51,inspectors71,Perfect Summer Fare,9,31 May 2016,"Just a few lines about a great, funny, sunny movie that makes me laugh every single time I see it. I think Harold Ramis' Caddyshack works like a big, joyous block party. You can't help but like every single character, every moment of crude and lewd, right down to Brian Doyle-Murray telling a caddie to ""Pick up that blood!""I think Caddyshack's peer, John Landis' Animal House is a funnier movie because of the chances it takes spearing sacred cows, but Caddyshack may be the smoother-frothier?-film because it avoids lagging at the start of the third reel, something that Landis throws in to build up steam for his big, obnoxious cherry-bomb-in-the- toilet ending.Caddyshack just ambles along, all big-heart and Lacy Underalls.Animal House is, at its core, something serious. There's an edge to the humor and to the end-of-Camelot story. I wrote a long review of AH some years ago. The boys and girls at Faber College (""Knowledge is Good!"") are about to be smacked upside the head by the hideous specter of Vietnam. It's their last moments of freedom before history arrives unannounced.Both have that feel of reading something hysterically funny in National Lampoon, and danged if it doesn't feel as if everyone is working his or her butt off to come up with a really good, really funny work of renegade art.What I've noticed about Caddyshack is that the power of Bill Murray ad-libbing his way through his duties as an assistant groundskeeper has, for the better part of forty years, provided inspiration for Caddyshackers to twist their mouths into a Joe Walsh mumble and utter the victorious cry, ""It's in the hole!""It's what cultures are built on . . .I think.",Caddyshack

53,brchthethird,Has a fair amount of laugh-worthy moments despite being slightly dull and unfocused,5,29 March 2016,"CADDYSHACK is yet another movie that everyone else but me has seen until now (apparently). It's directed by Harold Ramis and features Bill Murray and Chevy Chase in their prime, along with Rodney Dangerfield. Why wouldn't it be good? Well, if 90 minutes of improvisation with little to no plot is your idea of good comedy (and considering comedies these days, there are a lot of people who feel that way), then you'll feel right at home. For me, there were a number of individually funny bits from each of the main cast members, but the unfocused, episodic nature of the story kept me from being invested too much in the goings-on at this snooty country club. The best running gag is one that everyone is probably familiar with: Bill Murray and the gopher. But it was only funny in and of itself, feeling mostly tangential to the story (or to justify Bill Murray's presence). There was the potential to do a satire on class conflict, but Rodney Dangerfield threw a wrench in that (most of his bits didn't work for me at all). Chevy Chase got to do some of his shtick as well, but overall it felt like all the cast members were just trying to show each other up instead of being a real ensemble cast. I will say that the soundtrack, heavily featuring Kenny Loggins, was quite good though. Ultimately, I did laugh a handful of times but the script and its execution left a lot to be desired.",Caddyshack
54,mattymatt4ever,Not exactly a classic,6,21 April 2001,"""Caddyshack"" is a hit-or-miss comedy that I can't exactly classify as a comedy classic, like many have.  There are undoubtedly some hilarious moments provided by the great Rodney Dangerfield.  My favorite line he says in the movie is, ""I just got head by Amelia Earhart!"" after a plane flies over his head and barely misses him.  I don't know, maybe the humor is outdated.  Maybe it would've been funnier if I saw it when it first opened in 1980.  Nevertheless, I wasn't laughing as much as I thought I would.  The cast is great, without a doubt.  With a cast of actors including Dangerfield, Chevy Chase and Bill Murray it's hard to go wrong.  I found this movie pretty harmless.  I guess after watching movies like ""There's Something About Mary"" and ""Road Trip"" it's hard to get grossed out by the gags in this one.  Because I did hear criticism about the tastelessness of the gags.  I liked the song ""I'm Alright"" and love singing along to it. 
Some call this triumphant in its genre.  I found it pretty ordinary.  I wasn't laughing as hard as I thought I would.  Maybe Rodney should've made a couple more appearances.  He was in it for an amazingly short time.  He always spices a movie up when he's in it for the majority.  ""Caddyshack"" is simply a comedy that doesn't quite rise above the barrier of comic mediocrity.  I just didn't laugh enough.  My score:  6 (out of 10)",Caddyshack
55,hall895,Be the ball,7,15 September 2011,"More than thirty years after its initial release Caddyshack is now regarded as a comedy classic. People know it, love it, quote it. But does anyone even remember what this movie is actually about? It's the story of young caddy Danny Noonan, played by Michael O'Keefe, who is trying to finagle his way into a caddy scholarship for college by kissing the proper behinds. But all these years later nobody ever mentions poor O'Keefe or his character when they talk about this movie. Because Rodney Dangerfield stole the show. Or maybe Bill Murray stole the show. And wait, there's Chevy Chase too. Poor O'Keefe never stood a chance. His character may have been at the center of the movie's story but this is not a movie about story. This is a movie about laughs. And with Dangerfield, Murray and Chase involved there are certainly plenty of laughs to go around.So when looking back on this movie you don't focus on the story. You just think of your favorite moments. For many people the majority of those moments seem to revolve around Murray's character of grounds keeper Carl Spackler, a simple man who has total consciousness awaiting him on his deathbed. There's that Dalai Lama bit. There's his wonderful ""Cinderella story"". There's his swimming pool snack. And there's the one scene Murray's Carl shares with Chase's Ty Webb, two comic geniuses in a brilliant back-and-forth. Chase's character is more or less a reserved straight man in the movie though he definitely gets his zingers in too. Not at all reserved is the outrageous Dangerfield who holds nothing back with his blustery, scenery-chewing performance. He'll do or say anything for a laugh. Dangerfield's character of Al Czervik has a lack of tact and good grace which really gets under the skin of Judge Smails, played wonderfully by Ted Knight. The stodgy judge could use a proper nemesis and in the outlandish Al Czervik he more than meets his match. All the good stuff from Murray and Chase and Dangerfield and Knight overshadows O'Keefe. Heck, poor O'Keefe even gets overshadowed by a gopher. The movie may be nominally about young Danny Noonan but it seems that director Harold Ramis knew the big laughs would come from elsewhere and just let the rest of his cast go nuts and do what they do best. And it works terrifically. Yes, some of the jokes and gags fall a little flat. The movie has some fits and starts, doesn't consistently keep up the laughs all the way through. But when it hits it hits big and all in all there are more than enough laughs to cover up a few rough spots. Maybe the movie could have done with just a little bit more attention paid to its actual story. And there are some other characters floating about we might have liked to have spent a little more time with. For instance Cindy Morgan, playing the stunning temptress Lacey Underall, could have been given more to do. In this movie where story is left on the back burner it's really all about everyone in the cast making the most of their respective moments. And everyone does. Even the gopher.",Caddyshack
56,jhclues,"""--Oh, there won't be any money, but on your deathbed, you will receive...total consciousness--""",10,7 July 2001,"`National Lampoon's Animal House' may have been one of the first comedies to evolve from the `Saturday Night Live' generation, but it could be argued that `Caddyshack,' directed by Harold Ramis-- and which features two SNL alumni, Chevy Chase and Bill Murray-- actually spawned the entire `SNL genre,' of films, because this is the one that seemed to lock in that formulaic irreverence toward all things, of which they are so indicative. The story here revolves around a young man named Danny Noonan (Michael O'Keefe), a caddy at the upscale Bushwood Country Club, who is bucking for a caddy scholarship to get him into college.  Danny figures that the best shot he has at it is to volunteer for the assignment none of the other caddies want-- to caddy for the up-tight Judge Smails (Ted Knight), one of the executive directors of Bushwood, and `kiss up' a bit.  Smails responds by letting Danny mow his lawn and attend a christening ceremony for his new yacht.  But Danny is not one to be deterred, even when the good Judge tells him `The world needs ditch diggers, too.'  He just goes on, keeping his eyes and his options open.And it isn't long before Danny gets involved with Ty Webb (Chase), an independently wealthy goof-ball with a Zen/Chaplin philosophy of life, whose father was one of Judge Smails' partners in Bushwood.  So Danny takes some advice from Ty while caddying for him; advice which just may ultimately have an effect on whether or not he gets his scholarship.  Or maybe not.  Words of wisdom like `Be the Ball,' and `A donut with no hole is a danish,' may not be what he needs to put him on the fast track to success.  But then again, you never know; it's that kind of movie.  And there's no getting around it, this is funny stuff.The humor in this movie runs the gamut from broad to subtle, with at least two sight gags thrown in that identify it as belonging to the genre it helped create.  At the time of it's theatrical release, in 1980, it was fairly on the cutting edge of comedy; by today's standards, though, it doesn't seem nearly as irreverent, especially given the digressive trend in the genre lately, which has spewed forth such fare as `Freddy Got Fingered,' and `Road Trip.'  Then again, this one had Harold Ramis behind the camera, and Ramis has an acute sense of comedic timing, he knows what works, and he made the most of the basic screenplay (by Ramis, Brian Doyle-Murray and Douglas Kenney) and the terrific cast of comedians with which he had to work, all of whom fit so well into the pattern and fabric of this particular picture.Rarely does a comedy (or any film for that matter) have so many actors who fit their characters so perfectly as in this film, beginning with Chevy Chase, who embodies the slightly skewed and off-center Ty Webb so well it's almost frightening.  Webb is a guy who veritably floats through life in a perpetual Zen-like state of distraction, and it makes you realize that there probably really are characters like this walking around in the real world. But if the existence of a Ty Webb type is only highly probable, there's no doubt whatsoever about the fact that there are guys like Al Czervik amongst us.Rodney Dangerfield plays Czervik, the obnoxious, fun-loving, high-rolling land developer with a specially made golf club and an eye on Bushwood.  In Czervik, Dangerfield creates a character who is outrageous, droll, lacks any taste whatsoever, and is entirely hilarious.  It is, without question, the best character and performance of Dangerfield's cinematic career, and -- like Chase-- it's almost scary the way he fits into the character so naturally and completely.The real heart of this movie, however, is Bill Murray, who turns in what just may be the definitive Murray performance with his character, Carl Spackler, the Assistant Greenskeeper at Bushwood.  Murray brings Carl, the socially and intellectually challenged man-with-a-plan, to life with subtle nuance and a flare of comedic genius.  A lot of what he did in this film was improvised, including much of his two most memorable and hilarious scenes, one in which he's describing his encounter with the Dalai Lama, and the other being his soliloquy of the `Cinderella Boy' on the course at Atlanta. This is truly inspired, funny stuff, and it proves what can be done without resorting to banal vulgarity or crudeness (not that this film is entirely devoid of it, but at least it's tempered here somewhat-- not so overt and in-your-face like you'll often find in some of the more recent offerings of the genre).  And there's a harmless shiftiness about Carl, who is about as deep as a pan pizza, and Murray plays it all beautifully.O'Keefe gives a solid performance, as well, but he's basically the straight man here, the set-up guy for one funny situation after another.  And he does it quite nicely.Also giving memorable performances are Ted Knight, as the rigid, conservative Judge, and Brian Doyle-Murray as Lou Loomis, who oversees the caddies at Bushwood.The supporting cast includes Sarah Holcomb (Maggie), Scott Colomby (Tony), Cindy Morgan (Lacey Underall), Dan Resin (Dr. Beeper), Henry Wilcoxon (The Bishop), Albert Salmi (Mr. Noonan), John F. Barmon Jr. (Spaulding Smails) and Lois Kibbee (Mrs. Smails).  With this film, Ramis and company honed the formula for comedy that incorporated pop culture and contemporary sensibilities into it like never before.  And `Caddyshack' is an example of it in it's purest form; you'll have to look long and hard to find anything out of this same mold today that can come close to the prototype.  It's one of those movies that gets even better with age-- and funnier, too.  It's the magic of the movies.  I rate this one 10/10.",Caddyshack

58,stephenchase-63504,The funniest golfing comedy!!!!!!,10,26 February 2021,The funniest segment is the end credits!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,Caddyshack
59,gab-14712,"Bill Murray, Where Art Thou Gopher?",8,9 November 2017,"Golf is my least favorite sport. I think it's boring, and not fun to play. So you could imagine my trepidation heading into a golf film such as 1980's Caddyshack. I was pleasantly surprised by my reaction to this movie. The movie is really not about golf, but about the zany antics of the many characters in the film. The movie is crude and juvenile, but the humor really works. Not every joke is going to work, but there was enough screwball comedy to keep me chortling throughout the film.Caddyshack is Harold Ramis's directorial debut and he also written the screenplay along with Brian Doyle-Murray and Douglas Kenney. Ramis previously wrote one of my favorite 1978 comedies, Animal House. It is natural that he would bring the same type of humor to this film. As for directing, Ramis did a rather good job in his debut. There were some issues regarding connectivity of the characters, but I think he passed his first test.When coming up with the screenplay of the film, Murray and Ramis took experiences from their personal lives and added them to story. Growing up, they worked as caddies. So I liked how there was more of a personal touch to the movie than one would expect. One of my favorite scenes, the Baby Ruth candy in the swimming pool scene, actually happened for real at Murray's high school. Once you add the Jaws theme music, you have one of the best scenes of the movie.The plot of the film barely exists. What I mean is that the film is just a rapid series of comedic actions meant to make you laugh and in a screwball comedy, that is just fine. I will give you a basic outline of the plot. Danny Noonan (Michael O'Keefe) is a caddy working at the Bushwood County Club. In order to get himself a bright future, he wants to earn a caddy scholarship from Judge Elihu Smails (Ted Knight), the owner of the club. Al Czervik (Rodney Dangerfield) is a rude millionaire who wants to purchase the club, but Judge Smails has no time for Czervik's attitude. There is Ty Webb (Chevy Chase) who is a charming golfer who helps Danny try to figure out his true life goals. Finally, we meet the groundskeeper, Carl Spackler (Bill Murray) who is hell-bent on eliminating a gopher that is ruining the golf course.Hence here is where my biggest problem with the film lays. You may have noticed there was a lot jammed into the plot, even though there is not much of a plot to begin with. These characters are very entertaining in their own segments because they bring a different personality to the table, but they really are not connected. You would think that the actions of these characters would lead to some grand outcome that would connect them, but unfortunately that is not the case. The Carl Spackler chasing the gopher segment has nothing to do with the rest of the film. Although, those scenes are where I was most consistently laughing and Bill Murray absolutely rocked it as Carl Spackler.Each character has a different persona, and the actors did a great job portraying those personas. Chevy Chase is more of a charming, laidback golfer who is great at wooing in the ladies. Rodney Dangerfield is a witty, acerbic man who delivers rapid fire lines at the speed of light! Dangerfield was previously known as a comedian, and this is his first big movie role. I was impressed how he delivered his lines. His scenery-chewing, along with his insults and one-liners make him a memorable character. Bill Murray does wonderful as the self-absorbed groundskeeper, although it does make you wonder if this character is a remnant of Animal House. Ted Knight does a solid job as the judge, but maybe he is over-reaching just a little. Michael O'Keefe, who was so good in 1979's The Great Santini, delivers another strong performance here.I liked Caddyshack. Some people make it out to be a comedy classic of the ages, but I consider it to be an above-average screwball comedy that will make you laugh. The characters, even if they don't connect to the film as a whole, are memorable and funny. There are some quotable lines (thank you, Mr. Dangerfield). This is all light fun, and it does everything a comedy should do. It gets nothing but better for Mr. Ramis here on out. By the way, even that gopher is cute in an odd way.My Grade: B",Caddyshack
60,SmileysWorld,"Underneath the raunchiness and toilet humor,an enjoyable film",7,23 November 2012,"I liked Caddyshack for it's basic comedy elements.Ted Knight often never got enough credit for his basic comedic talent.His knack for vocal and physical reactions are classic and he shines here,as always.The film is loaded with legendary comedic talent,from Bill Murray,on down to Dangerfield,who was appearing in his first film.I loved the whole ""snobs vs. slobs"" angle and the way it all came to an end.The area in which I have to start deducting points is,(and I will probably take a hit or two for this)is where all of the raunchiness and toilet humor come in.I am not a big fan of either,but there wasn't enough of it there to keep me from finding the film enjoyable overall.",Caddyshack

It got negative reviews upon release and producer Douglas Kenney, known for co founding the magazine National Lampoon in 1970, commited suicide by jumping off a cliff at the Hanapepe Lookout at Hawaii, but as time went by, it would later become a cult classic and that's a good thing.I was a teenager when I first watched this movie and it gave me some laughs. Not to mention that it had some recognizable actors including the late Rodney Dangerfield, Chevy Chase and Bill Murray. And to my surprise, it's a really really good film.The story is well written as it does establish the character of Danny Noonan and his interactions with everyone at the Bushwood Country Club. The side characters, including Ty Webb, Al Czervik, Carl Spackler, and Judge Smails, are so entertaining and provide the best subtle comedic delivery thanks to the late actors Rodney Dangerfield and Ted Knight along with Chevy Chase and Bill Murray giving some good performances. The pacing is very good and that it never has a dull moment. The music score is good too and the Kenny Loggins song ""I'm Alright"" sets up the rest of the film very well. Not to mention the scenery is gorgeous to look at especially the golfing sequences.Overall, Caddyshack is a sports comedy film done right and after 40 years of it's release, it deserves a seal of approval.",Caddyshack
62,Maziun,"Classic , but I like more sophisticated movies",8,26 May 2013,"When I think of 80's comedies I usually think about movies like "" Police academy"" , ""Trading places"" , ""Back to school "" , "" National lampoons vacation"" , ""Beverly Hills cop"" or ""Ghostbusters"" . Somehow I didn't got to see ""Caddyshack"" until last year. This movie has been called on of the greatest comedy movies of 80's and beyond. To be honest I think the movie is a little bit overrated ( probably because of the cult status it has). I didn't enjoyed it as much as I expected . I would rather watch one more time one of the movies I've mentioned above.It doesn't mean I don't like the movie at all. The problem for me is that a lot of the jokes fall flat. There is plenty of ""low"" humor , over-the-top humor and at times also quite vulgar humor. I think I like a little bit more sophisticated humor. On the other hand I like the fact that this movie is not politically correct . I laughed hard at some of the jokes that will be probably offensive to other people ( For example – Rodney Dangerfield tells his Asian friend "" This is a rather exclusive club , so don't tell anyone that you're a Jew"" ) . The parody of ""Jaws "" is priceless. Gunga Allunga. Overall , I had good time , but it's not necessarily my type of comedy.There is also a little problem with the screenplay. Danny Noonan (Michael O'Keefe) is supposed to be the main hero of the movie , yet he ends as a supporting character. He isn't even on the movie poster ! There is a love story between him and Maggie (Sarah Holcomb) that I've found rather boring and unnecessary . One could wonder wouldn't it be better for the movie to get rid of his character . Most of the jokes are otherwise provided by the so-called supporting characters that obviously and easily steal the whole show. I like the fact that the movie feels improvised , but the writers should make the story a little bit more focused.Acting is definitively a strong side of ""Caddyshack"" . Chevy Chase , Bill Murray , Rodney Dangerfield and Ted Knight – each one of these actors fits his role PERFECTLY. All those characters are very charismatic and memorable. Chase plays Ty Webb - a rich and lazy guy with a Zen philosophy of life. Dangerfield plays Al Czervik – obnoxious , rich businessman from Czech Republic who's got no taste whatsoever. Murray plays Carl Spackler – retarded gardener who's trying to kill pesky ( but cute) gopher . Oh , by the way the obviously mechanic gopher was created by George Lucas. Last but not least Knight plays Judge Smails – hysterical and arrogant owner of the golf club. Other actors also give fine performances. It was also good to see Cindy Morgan (Lacey Underall) naked.The soundtrack is great . Kenny Loggins songs are catchy , especially the main song – "" I'm alright "" . Other artists are : Eddie Cochran ""Summertime blues"" ,Earth Wind and Fire"" Boogie Wonderland"" , Hilly Michaels ""Something on your mind"" , Journey ""Any way you want it "", The Paul Collins Beat ""There she goes"" , Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky ""Waltz of the Flowers - Nutcracker Ballet"" and Bill Murray (!)""Ballad of the Green Berets"". All those songs are great as well. The original music made by Johnny Mandel is very jazzy and nice. The musical scenes are beautifully choreographed and the music is excellent.This movie is better than any movie mad by Adam Sandler or Farrelly brothers , but I like other 80's comedies better. Still , if you like this type of humor you will probably enjoy yourself. I give it 8/10.",Caddyshack
63,rebeljenn,that gopher...,2,18 October 2005,"'Caddyshack' is one of those films that many people seem to really love. Yes, it has a few funny moments and a few funny scenarios, but there really is not that much more to it. I personally found the film to be annoying. (The most memorable was the gopher incident, and this is probably a running - err, digging - joke among those who enjoy their games of golf.) I don't think this film is for everyone. I mean, I certainly did not enjoy it. Then again, I have never played golf in my life; I don't watch it on television either. If you enjoy golf, you will probably enjoy some of the jokes in this film, but it is not for everyone and the humor is not for everyone.",Caddyshack
64,Ben_Cheshire,"Uneven, see it for Chevy Chase.",4,27 June 2004,"Uneven comedy has three or four B-stories, which lead us astray from the less-interesting A-story of the young caddy Danny Noonan who wants to be a golfer. You could write four or five different plot outlines focusing on the different B-stories, but the best one probably just focuses on general ""comic goings-on at an exclusive golf club,"" (Rob Hartill, imdb Plot Outline).This is Harold Ramis's first film. He would go on to make the first National Lampoon's Vacation movie with Chevy Chase, and one of the best comedies ever made, Groundhog Day. We also have him to thank for Analyse This. For fans of Ramis, this is definitely worth a look.Bill Murray is insane and over-the-top (and pretty funny in places), Cindy Morgan is cute as Lacey Underall, the big boss's daughter, the kid Danny Noonan is funny looking and i'd be happy if I never saw Rodney Dangerfield ever again - but the gem of the piece is without a doubt Chevy Chase. He's the reason to see this. This is his first big movie role after being discovered on Saturday Night Live (his career would get its big boost with Vacation in 83 and Fletch in 85) - and its a knockout. Its one of those parts where he'll say a line completely deadpan, and you're ears will do a double-take, and you'll go: hang on, what did he say?For fans of undergraduate comedy like Animal House, this is worth a look. If anyone is particularly offended by racial humour, there are enough racial stereotypes and jokes in the beginning to end a peace conference. They're not malicious, and they peter off after the first half hour, and after this it ends up being enjoyable and pretty funny - especially Chevy Chase. 6/10.",Caddyshack

Characters start to make bad decisions and one thing leads to another and so on. You get the idea. It's not funny and the actors look bored. You'll be bored. Chase is awful and looks silly. Still, I thought this was cute and not bad. I thought that there was really good chemistry between the main characters. From an artistic standpoint, there were some plot elements and character developments I didn't think were totally needed. They do however drive the story, which seemed to be their purpose, so I can accept them.",Caddyshack

The plot is that a caddy at a golf course named Danny Noonan (Michael O'Keefe) is a doing just about anything to raise money to go to college. While Danny is trying to get a caddy scholarship from the owner Judge Elihu Smails (Ted Knight), Smails has to deal with a brash new member of the course Al Czervik (Rodney Dangerfield). When a character is played by Dangerfield it's pretty much what you would expect. Al is eccentric, and a loudmouth. He's always annoying Smails with his over the top machines, weather it be his Rolls-Royce, his boat, or even his golf bag. Anyway while all that is going on, there's a subplot about Carl Spackler (Bill Murray) the assistant greens keeper who is told to kill every gopher on the field. Carl is a lovable idiot and goes way overboard and uses sniper rifles, and plastic explosives to kill one gopher, who ends up surviving. Along the way are two golf games, hilarious one liners from Dangerfield and brilliant comedy from Knight and Murray. It was the first film of Harold Ramis who does a really great job. I certainly recommend it if you like great comedy.",Caddyshack

Through it all a caddy, Danny, struggles to get a scholarship, girlfriend and a brighter future in one shot. Salvation comes, of course, through golf.Caddyshack is a feel-good comedy for your inner golfing man-child (if you have one). Don't fight it, go with it. Nothing happens that does not work out for the better in the end. Hence the Kenny Loggins tune ""I'm Alright"" is more an overall theme for the film than merely a song in the soundtrack. Bill Murray, Rodney Dangerfield, Ted Knight, Chevy Chase, and assorted awkward teenagers combine well in respect to this feel-good vibe. The bar is set low enough anyway. I was surprised that Key Biscayne in Miami, near where I used to live, is one of the filming locations. I happily remember funny quotes, characters and scenes from when I first saw Caddyshack as a teenager, but I did not enjoy the film recently nearly as much as I did 40 years ago. This is mostly because women are treated so badly and as if they cannot think for themselves. Why else the character Lacey Underall? Really?!

68,OriginalMovieBuff21,One of the funniest movies of all-time!!!,10,18 May 2004,"Caddyshack is probably, without a doubt, one of the funniest movies ever designed and created on a film. Ted Knight was the funniest character in the film as the angry and jealous owner of Bushwood golf course. His lines are so funny. ""Spalding, how many times have I told you about your language!"" I died laughing throughout the whole movie at Ted Knight's jokes and Rodney Dangerfield's jokes who comes close in being the funniest character as the smart-ass goofy dress inventor. The entire movie is just laughing. I laughed so hard that I was about to fall off my couch while I was crying. Caddyshack might be the funniest movie along with Stripes or Dumb & Dumber.

69,Horror-yo,Late 70's uptight society going loose,5,4 October 2016,"It's understandable this would turn out to be considered a comedy classic if you look at the fact this is one of Bill Murray's firsts, a film featuring an ever-verbose Rodney Dangerfield, a beautiful young Cindy Morgan and the then very popular Chevy Chase, and when you conjugate all that to a Golf field, what with the caddy culture, a youth meaning to have fun by all means...this was all very relevant and culturally very current.But in itself, as a comedy being watched today, we're given a little bit of plot, some pretty funny moments from time to time, but overall something of a predictable, a bit flat, over-the-top and puerile 1980 effort that will go a bit all over the place in various parts.There's some fun to be had, but it's very certainly no masterpiece.",Caddyshack
70,cultfilmfreaksdotcom,Danny Noonan & The Four Legendary Horsemen,9,14 August 2018,"Originally an ANIMAL HOUSE of golf, directed by its co-writer, Harold Ramis, CADDYSHACK morphed into an eclectic comedy starring four comic actors that - had the rudimentary vision sustained - probably would have been random guest appearances amid the shack-dwelling youngsters... Although a 'teen' is still the main character - the straight-man pawn, Michael O'Keefe as Danny Noonan, with one of the best natural golf swings recorded on film (most actors have horrible swings even when playing pros). After an opening credit bicycle ride from a crowded and noisy, low class home, he passes a strip of mansions to classy Bushwood Country Club backed by Kenny Loggins' smooth party anthem I'm Alright: bridging a grainy late-70's yacht rock groove into the preppy vs anti-preppy decade to come...Then Danny winds in and out of misadventures including an attempt to appeal to Ted Knight's stuffy Judge Smails for a possible college scholarship while faithfully caddying his mentor in Chevy Chase's quirky millionaire Ty Webb, sharing the most subtle yet hilarious moments in-between butting heads with cool cat Italian bully Scott Colomby, the other ""kid"" whose role wasn't diminished to a cameo. The R-Rating is earned between our caddy and one of the hottest of underrated and underused starlets, Cindy Morgan, far more beautiful and interesting than Laurie Metcalf as Danny's knocked-up girlfriend (using a bad accent of some kind), whose bland romantic melodrama should've been left on the cutting room floor...Meanwhile, Bill Murray, despite the overall popularity of his character, isn't at his best here, chasing a stuffed gopher that, getting around cooler and funnier than CGI, seems a nod to b-movies that can't afford any better... With his bottom lip hanging to pilot a contrived manner of speech, in place of his MEATBALLS (and future STRIPES and GHOSTBUSTERS) glib confidence, Murray's assistant groundskeeper, Carl, seeming part of an SNL skit stretched too long. Leaving ultimate fan-favorite Rodney Dangerfield as a condo developer who insults anyone within verbal/audible reach - the epitome of a scene-stealer... While we see Bushwood through the vulnerable young eyes of O'Keefe's Danny Noonan, it's Dangerfield's cocky Al Czervik who provides both the Roman Chorus and an unintentional narration, from start to finish, in a perfectly timed 97-minute ride.",Caddyshack
71,lathe-of-heaven,"Funny in places; enjoyable, but in my lowly & wretched opinion way, WAY overrated... Blu-ray: Very Good (especially for it's age) A:8 V:9",6,14 December 2013,"Well, I FINALLY saw this just now (I know, you look at the date here and likely cannot believe it) I've always heard what a Comedy classic this is and I just now had the opportunity to see the Blu-ray.I will say that for a modestly budgeted film made in 1980, the Blu-ray is just about one of THE best looking I've ever seen. I was REALLY amazed that they were able to squeeze out this kind of picture quality from a film like this, especially when other, higher cost films from the same era do not look any where near this good.Now, about the film. I don't know... Just being honest, I truly do not see quite what makes this film such a TOTAL classic like people say. There is one reviewer here who states that this is one of the TOP 5 Comedy films of all time. Really...? I mean, don't get me wrong, there are a number of set pieces that are indeed pretty funny. The scene where Bill Murray and Chevy Chase are together is pretty good; and for the most part, I thought Chevy's delivery was the funniest with his low-key chic, goofy style. BUT... and it is a frigg'n HUGE BUT like Mariah Carey's... for the most part, I really thought that the humour and performances were just silly and I truly felt that if the writing had been a LOT better, THEN, MAYBE this could have been closer to a classic. But, for example, I LOVE Rodney Dangerfield, and he was his usual lovable self in his performance and bearing. BUT... again... I felt quite honestly that his lines were simply ATROCIOUS! That same reviewer who I mentioned before also said that Rodney's lines, for example like right after he farted and said, 'Who stepped on a duck', were just rolling in the aisles hilarious. Uh, okay... I mean, come on... his lines like when all the old people are dancing at the club, 'Hey, the cemetery is just around the corner' and 'I've never seen dead people smoking'... Uh... does that sound like the height of hilarity to you...?I truly do NOT mean to diss this EXTREMELY well loved film, I don't; and, all in all I enjoyed it I think mainly because it was sort of tied together with some funny parts. But like ALL of Ted Knight's lines and delivery were completely forced, plastic and stupid sounding (rest his soul...) and other things similar to this in my unworthy opinion really took away from the funniness of the film. BUT... there were some good bits and funny situations; and the gopher addition was pretty funny in a simple kind of way.In trying to understand this, I think of films that I MYSELF find far, FAR funnier, I mean, ORDERS OF MAGNITUDE funnier, and I just don't understand it. Okay, pretty much here we are talking about simple, low-brow, but not overly crude humour. To me, ALL of the 'NAKED GUN' films and Geez, MOST of Mel brooks' and the MARX Brothers' films are frigg'n LIGHT YEARS funnier than this. These films that I mention here are REALLY silly too, but in my lowly estimation the silliness is usually quite clever or the situations and characters come across a LOT funnier. Here with this film, I never really felt that ANYTHING was particularly 'clever' at all... And, to me, none of the characters, with the exception of Chevy Chase, and to SOME extent, Bill Murray, were all that likable or engaging (I DID think though that Bill Murray's ad-libbed scene about getting all horny and worked up over the old lady golfers was hilarious!) Again, an excellent example of one of the many ISOLATED bits that were indeed very funny in this film.I don't know; maybe I'm just over-thinking it and I should just sit back and enjoy it for what it is. But, to me anyway, I THINK it was just basically the writing and dialog that drastically diminished the quality of the comedy overall. Like I mentioned, IF for example, Rodney's lines had been the USUAL GREAT Rodney lines, then fine. I mean, he was bloody AWESOME in 'BACK TO SCHOOL'. But the writing and intelligence behind that film to me were of HUGELY better quality.Anyway, I just thought I would drop my honest thoughts here amongst the raving reviews. I KNOW that Comedy, like Horror, and many other art forms is HIGHLY subjective and apparently MANY people DO find this film one of the funniest ever. So, I would say that if you like your Comedy rather simple, but fun and silly, then you probably will like it. BUT... if you are like me where you really want at least some level of cleverness in the writing and the characters, then you may find this movie a little bit wanting...",Caddyshack
72,buckikris,Caddyshack Scores,9,1 September 2014,"I just watched this movie again last night. I keep forgetting this film gets better with age. It's been 34 years since it debuted in 1980. The first time I saw it I was very young, about 10. I watched it on T.V. of course it was cut; but you never forget your 1st comedy. I can't say anything negative about this film. The cast, plot, and scenery are-flawless. The movie begins on a plush golf course(Bushwood). It takes place in Nebraska, but the filming is done mostly in and around the Boca Raton area-Florida. You can tell this when we go to the yacht club in the movie. The movie begins where the viewer is introduced to this beautiful golf course in the morning. The sprinklers are on, and this gopher is tearing up the coarse. We also hear the song I'm All Right, by Kenny Loggins playing. The camera cuts and to a house in the city. The Noonan home, it is full of kids, and rowdy as ever. Danny (Micheal O'Keefe) is the oldest and is a caddy at Bushwood. His parents make sure most of his money, including his tips go into a jar, the college fund. Once he talks to his father; and eats breakfast he is off to work at Bushwood. Once at Bushwood we are introduced to the rest of the rowdy crew. Mel Loomis(Brian Doyle Murray) is the boss; and is perfect for the role. He is the straight boss that is cool; and if he likes you will let things slide. He is also one that likes to slack on the rules and you will notice that during the end of the film. Bill Murray(Carl Spackler) is a man on a mission. He is the Assistant Grounds Keeper. Carl is responsible for getting rid of this gopher. He tries everything, water down the holes, changing holes, and shooting it. Also in the movie are Ted Knight( Judge Smails), Rodney Dangerfield( Czervik), and Chevy Chase(TY), to name a few. The movie is about a Danny, who as a caddy needs a scholarship to help his parents pay for his college. Noonan tries to suck up to Judge Smails, for the caddy scholarship. We are then introduced to Rodney Dangerfield(Czervik). Who is a condo builder and his building just across from Bushwood. He is very funny and very obnoxious. As soon as he arrives, he and Smails get into it. Once the two are on the course Czervik bets him on everything when it comes to golf. Judge Smails soon realizes Czervik is his nemesis and a menace to the game of golf. Danny is a great caddy; and bonds with Ty. The two become quick friends, and Danny asks and takes Ty's advice when it comes to golf. The annual Caddy tournament is here and Danny wins first place. As the movie goes along Czervik and Smails get a bet going that gets up to 80 thousand dollars. Once the coarse hears about it, the bets are on. Ty hopes Danny will be his caddy, but draws Smails instead. As the game proceeds Ty realizes Czervik sucks at golf. It is time for a new plan, Czervik shoots his ball so the ball will come back a hit him right in the arm. Ty is down a partner and decides to draw Danny. Judge Smails looks at him for a decision, and Danny excepts Ty's offer. There goes the Caddy scholarship, but if Ty and Danny pull it off, he will not need it. As the game proceeds Ty and Danny tie it up. It comes down to the 18 hole and the pressure is on. Ty looks at Danny and says don't worry if you miss we lose. Danny shot comes up short, and Smails and the Doc. think they have it in the bag. The ball is on the very tip; and ready to drop. Just when the game should be over, but Lou keeps watching that ball. All of a sudden Carl uses the dynamite on the gopher. The ball drops into the hole, Ty and Danny get their revenge Smails. It's a party at Bushwood due to the outcome; but Carl doesn't get the gopher in the end. This movie has it all, Golf, The Murray brothers, big laughs, fun at the pool; and some hanky panky. It is a non-stop laugh-a-thon. If this movie doesn't bring a smile and laughs to you; please check your pulse. THX, Kris L. CocKayne",Caddyshack

Cindy Morgan is beautiful, Michale O'Keefe is charismatic, and neither of them were ever (well, almost never) heard from again.Fun to watch the most popular comedic actors of the 1980's do their thing, but all these years later the bad edits really stand out, the low-budget sticks up, and Harold Ramis shows he's not quite up to the task of directing a real movie.

Dangerfield is incredibly hilarious, Chase is dry and witty (sorta like David Spade), and Murray does his best ever imitation of Bluto Blutarsky (John Belushi). Oh, and let's not forget the gopher. The mere thought of it makes me laugh.So, how on earth did no one notice that the audiences would be interested in the interaction between those three? I can only think of one scene where Chase and Dangerfield appeared together, and they might have crossed one or two words. Meanwhile, we are subjected to the tediousness of stale, bad jokes made by all the caddies. Maybe I am wrong here, but if I had gathered those 3 comedic geniuses, I would have made a picture around them. Harold Ramis instead made a movie about an unknown, who nobody cared (or cares) about, and littered the film with sporadic appearances by the top notch actors.Kinda like going to a Pink Floyd concert and learning that they would sing 4 of their best songs, separated by 10-15 minutes of music by bad bands.Still, I rate this one a 7 / 10, just because the actors really push the script to the limit (that is, if there was a script to begin with).

The combination of SNL players and established comedic stars produces one of the funniest movies of that generation.

A caddy who cannot pay for college himself, O'Keefe, aligns himself with the corrupt judge, Knight, to win the Caddy Scholarship. That's pretty much the plot. In between are wonderful performances by the rest of the cast, each playing an individual character that are annoying on their own, but seem to fit in at Bushwood Country Club. There are classic scenes, especially for anyone who has ever played golf. From a Bishop being struck by lightning while playing his best ever round, to ""Na-na-na-na,"" to a misplaced Baby Ruth bar, and of course the gopher that inhabits the course.

Along the way, we meet Danny's mentor, the demented Ty Webb (Chevy Chase), a professional golfer who really doesn't give a damn about golf, if the truth be told, Judge Smalls (Ted Knight), the tightly wound president of the Country Club who finds himself in a battle of wills with one Al Czervik (Rodney Dangerfield), a rich slob who wreaks havoc at the club and makes an instant enemy out of Smails and Carl (Bill Murray), a nutty grounds keeper who finds himself in battle with one wild gopher who is digging holes all over the golf course.This movie provides non-stop laughs from start to finish and features a soundtrack that is a dream to lovers of music from the late 1970's. Dangerfield and Murray provide the lion's share of the laughs here and, if the truth be told, Ted Knight has never been seen to better advantage. A comedy classic that just gets funnier with age.",Caddyshack
81,headly66,Classic comedy,8,11 December 2009,"There are few comedies that you can truly watch over and over and not be bored. This might be the tops in that category. Is it dated, yes of course, anything that is almost 30 years old is going to look different than the quality of film today but what makes Caddyshack work is that it is unique in it's ability to be both irreverent and timeless at the same time. It does not reference topical jokes or use 80's clichés so it can be watched by any generation and still be funny. I really can't stand Chevy Chase except in a few things and here he is just mildly funny and a bit pompous, but the other actors do a great job, Cindy Morgan is delicious, Rodney offers some of the best classic one liners ever, Ted Knight is hilarious and Bill Murry is brilliant as the disgusting moronic grounds keeper and has some of the most quoted lines in movie history.

82,Benjamin_Cox,Below par - 52%,5,17 November 2011,"Here's another one of those movies I'd seen years ago and fell in love with. But now, in the cold and harsh light of adulthood, I somehow find myself wondering what the fuss was about. It has its highlights but never feels like an actual movie, more like a series of golf-themed comic vignettes from the stars of the early Eighties. Speaking of which, I can think of few movies as dated as this one - it is as resolutely Eighties as Mr T, Joan Collins' shoulder pads and Kenny Loggins who (surprise, surprise) pops up on the soundtrack.Welcome to Bushwood Country Club, an exclusive resort with a golf course and spa facilities. Owner Judge Smails (Ted Knight) likes to maintain the club's high standards and is deeply put out when obnoxious new member Al Czervik (Rodney Dangerfield) comes along for a round or two. But Smails has other concerns beside Czervik - a troublesome gopher continues to evade the best efforts of deranged grounds-keeper Carl Spackler (Bill Murray) while semi-pro Ty Webb (Chevy Chase) tries to teach young caddie Danny (Michael O'Keefe) a few lessons about life and love, possibly involving Smails' flightly niece Lacey Underall (Cindy Morgan).""Caddyshack"" is a frustrating film in many respects. The undoubted highlight is Murray's battle against the gopher which seems to be the only constant throughout the film. For example, I got the feeling from the opening that Danny the caddie would be the film's focus but as the film goes on, I got the feeling that the script lost interest in Danny and focused more on Webb and Czervik. And sadly, the film's fatal flaw lies in its pro- and antagonist - Knight is too stuck up but is nothing like as annoying as Dangerfield who you're supposed to root for, which is something I simply couldn't do. He delivers his lines way too fast and overacts as though its the only thing he knows what to do which I can believe. The true stars are Murray and Chase and personally, they aren't in it enough for me to enjoy the film any more.I have other issues with it as well - the comedy only really works in fits and starts and the main characters in the plot don't engage you in the same way that Murray and Chase's do. There isn't a real plot line in the movie which also doesn't help things and the humour is mostly childish and toilet-based. It also seems mildly sexist in its treatment of female characters and Dangerfield is a colossal waste of space - lots of people find him funny but I find him about as funny as a famine charity appeal. Maybe I enjoyed as a child because I was a child...",Caddyshack

Man and perhaps the most recognizable movie of the 80s with perhaps a funny dialogue, and scenes especially the ones with Rodney Dangerfield(may God rest his soul) I like especially the part when he wrecks the other guys boat and drops his anchor on his and says ""hey! You scratched my anchor!"" Ha ha ha ha! I love that part and not to mention the part with the candy bar, when it went into the pool, everyone went running out thinking it's crap. That is something I'll never forget. I like it also when Bill's character eats it and the rich guys lady faints. And no to mention the scene with the crazy golfer who keeps winning every game he does, until he looses one, and gets struck by lightning, and Bill just leaves him there, another memorable scene.

Some of the slapstick humor has lost kick. I remember laughing through my nose when i was younger and no i didn't laugh or i just chuckled. The funniest thing in the whole movie is the little shorts they are wearing. One thing i don't miss about the late seventies and eighties. I think that if it wasn't for Bill Murray (which i love) the movie would get a 4. And if it wasn't for Chevy Chase, i would rate this movie 3.

87,jbartelone,Has Some Funny Moments. But Hardly A Classic,5,16 January 2007,"Don't get me wrong, The film has some funny moments no question, and it is for many people a comedy classic. But for me, something appears to be missing or tainting the film from approaching symbolic comic status.It could be the predictability of the characters along with the shallow superficial jokes and situations that they are involved in, (i.e drugs, golf, and sex.) In my view, the film may be rated higher by the teenage crowd who are interested in this type of simplicity entertainment.There is also the issue that there is not enough comic plot for a full length movie. The ""big bet"" golf tournament scene wants the audience to be drawn into the ""great moment of ha-ha comedy."" The problem is that the one-liner jokes, some of the best, in the first half-hour or so, do not make up for the rest of the movie that seems to drag and isn't sure where it wants to take us. Maybe, if you like golf, this movie will do more for you.Another problem is Rodney Dangerfield. While I am not a fan of his personally, I ADORED his work in the movie ""Back to School."" where he had some GREAT one-liners. In Caddyshack, every word that comes out of Dangerfield's mouth is neither funny nor clever, it is just obscene. I have no issue with R-rated language when it serves a purpose in any movie. But here in Caddyshack, I found Rodney Dangerfield's character offensive without reason. What's the point? There are some great veteran comic actors in this film. It's just too bad that they didn't have a stronger storyline or a funnier script throughout the movie to make it better.",Caddyshack
88,simonrosenbaum,Dangerously unfunny!,5,23 October 2006,I've just watched this for the first time and thought it a bit of a mixed bag. I liked the way it starts and found Chevy Chase very funny and I like Bill Murray's unusual turn but when Rodney Dangerfield turns up it absolutely spoils it for me. I find his performance one of the unfunniest and annoying I've ever seen. Also the tone of the film is a bit confused with the occasional dramatic scenes getting in the way of the over the top slapstick as if it was originally going to be a more serious film. The film is still a fairly enjoyable if unsubtle comedy which has obviously influenced a generation notably the Farrelly brothers and the American Pie series. Just a shame about Dangerfield.

90,RMS1949,Very Over Rated,5,9 February 2007,"Okay, I'm not going to trash the movie but for so long this movie has been so ridiculously over-rated I just had to comment. To me they took what could of been a just a fun Saturday Night Live skit and stretched and stretched until they had a feature film.. Bill Murray ( of whom I'm a fan ) has been much better in other movies and so has Rodney Dangerfield for that matter. There's a few good laughs but the majority of comedy skits in it are both slow and extremely predictable. Maybe it was golfers that pushed it over the top . I don't know if its losing some of its reputation with each passing year, but for me it wasn't that great the year it was released.",Caddyshack
91,jrs-8,I know I am in the minority but......,5,30 October 2002,"I don't think ""Caddyshack"" is that good. I think it's ok. I'll say right off the top that I am not a golfer. I never have been and probably never will be. Does that have anything to do with my not seeing this film as the classic many people do? Perhaps. But being an avid golfer wouldn't have stopped me from finding holes in the script.Is it really believable that Bill Murray's character would actually be hired at such a posh golf course? That a gopher would present that many problems? Was it really necessary to include the sub-plot with the main caddy and his girlfriend who, without reason, is given an Irish accent? SPOILER WARNING!! With so much money on the line would the winning shot falling into the hole because of an explosion not be contested in the least? It was clearly shown that the ball had stopped short of the hole. The match was over. But the bad guys couldn't be allowed to win right? Give me a break.Before all the trash gets thrown at me I will point out some things I liked about the film. There are some funny moments. The Baby Ruth scene with Bill Murray is classic. Had there been more belly laughs like that I would see what everyone else sees. I also liked Murray's scene of pretending to be in the Masters as he destroys flowers with his imaginary tee shots. Rodney Dangerfield steals the movie in every scene he is in. His non-stop banter is an absolute riot. Cindy Morgan looks fantastic even if her role is unnecessary. Michael O'Keefe is totally likeable as the lead caddy.As for the other performances, Chevy Chase is amusing enough in an underwritten role. I wish his part had been bigger. But since he has such contempt for the club and its owners it makes no sense that he would be in the bar in a key scene that serves only to set up his being part of the big match at the end. And why not give him more then one major scene with Bill Murray? Two greatly talented comedians should be sharing more screen time. Ted Knight is basically playing his Ted Baxter from ""The Mary Tyler Moore Show"". And that gopher!! It was cute at first but finally became an annoying distraction. Perhaps the creators realized the material was so thin.In the end ""Caddyshack"" barely makes par. It certainly isn't on the level of ""Animal House"" which obviously influenced this film. Again I know I am in the minority on this one. But laughter is involuntary. What makes one person laugh won't necessarily make another laugh. Many people laughed throughout this film. I laughed only sporadically.",Caddyshack

93,teejayniles2345,Pop Culture anti-traditional conformity,9,5 August 2001,"This 1980 ""summer comedy"" was given the Primetime hero's treatment last night on the NBC TV network (August 3, 2001).  A weekend anchor from the TODAY SHOW even presided over a series of pompous interviews (What was great/memorable about this part of your movie career?) that made it seem like a past Oscar-contender.  Director/co-writer Harold Ramis knowlingly smirked through all the worshipful treatment his effort was getting from this media giant.  It all seemed a bit ""scratch my back, I'll scratch your back"" when Bill Murray's family (including a co-writer of this movie) was given a commercial of sorts for a St. Augustine, FL Restaurant-bar themed ""Caddyshack.""  [Where were the mini-interview with the female performers or the musical composer?]        In certain ways, I don't understand how CADDYSHACK rated such a reverent homage.  Other than a previously drastically edited-down network broadcast of this effective vignette/sketch ""cotton candy,"" it wasn't a blip on my cultural ""radar screen.""  I can't remember hearing this much tribute being paid to it from any of the original audiences singing its praises.  Now more than two decades after its theatrical release, it does seem to have marked the onset of a genre of studio product that is quite UNcommendable.  Certain captivating ""Saturday Night Live"" sketch performers are routinely given the opportunity to take their improv skills or ""fixed"" characters to the ""big screen"" and thumb their noses at the Hollywood establishment or American traditionalism in a film project of some sort.  When a creative script and a charismatic comedian's persona jel and become ""more"" appealing, then you have a breakaway hit like BEVERLY HILLS COP was for Eddie Murphy (a SNL alumnus). The uncreative scripts and uncharismatic or downright offensive comedians are a horrendous litany of movie schlock. In the case of CADDYSHACK, the script concerns a ""sport"" that is familiar to mainstream Americans and is quite effectively irreverent toward the ""Country Club"" set.  Ramis' employing several strong comedic actors who are doing fair to middling (with apparently only slight direction from him at the helm) does make for a positive result.  NBC still managed to ""cut and paste"" around some of the profanities and barely-there nudity to make this a de-fanged product.  The gopher, to me, looked barely better than a TV character from my childhood TV watching: Bunny Rabbit on the CAPTAIN KANGAROO morning schedule.  I would be a more solid admirer of this film if the entire enterprise was greater than the sum of its separately funny (often hilarious) parts; unfortunately, it's not quite the best work that this director/writer has to offer.  Young videophiles in search of good counsel should keep searching in your video store's comedy section for the same director's GROUNDHOG DAY or a more effective comedy of this era titled GHOSTBUSTERS, if seeking a ""nostalgia""-comedy from the 1980's.  I give CADDYSHACK an 8 out of 10 [but not the snipped version of the TV broadcast].",Caddyshack
94,ericjg623,A classic!,10,14 January 2002,"This movie will never get old, like ""Airplane!"", it's a comedy classic. The best part about it is it took some of America's top comic actors when they were at the prime of their careers and built a comedy that's more than just the sum of its parts. I mean, just having Bill Murray or Rodney Dangerfield in a movie, even a mediocre one, guarantees you will laugh, but this film features these two, along with Chevy Chase and Ted Knight, in what is arguably each man's funniest effort. As with most comedies, the plot is pretty much incidental to the film itself. In this case, it's centered on a young caddy who can't afford to go to college, so he is forced to suck up to the head of the country club (Ted Knight) in an effort to get his blessing for a caddy scholarship. His golf mentor is a rich heir (Chevy Chase, back when he was still funny) who's into ""Zen golf"" and gives Danny advice like ""Be the ball"" and ""A donut with no hole is a Danish"". To complicate matters, a real estate developer (Rodney Dangerfield) shows up with his entourage, looking, not to join the club but instead to buy it. This is the setup for the rest of the film. From the start, the expansive, profane, boorish Dangerfield character clashes with the anal, rigid, and tantrum-prone club president, Judge Smails. And, in the background, Bill Murray is the groundskeeper who's been ordered to kill all the gophers on the course. Of course, this order comes from his Scottish boss, a man with an accent as thick as Guinness Stout, and Murray's character Carl, replies ""But if I kill all the golfers, they'll lock me up and throw away the key!""Anyway, that's the basic premise. What makes this movie work are the lead actors, as well as first rate scriptwriting. You normally wouldn't think of a golf course as being the scene for great comedy, but with this bunch, anything goes. There's tons of great dialog; Judge Smails ""Danny, I've sentenced boys younger than you to the gas chamber. Didn't want to, but I felt I owed it to them"", Dangerfield to a woman at the club ""Last time I saw a mouth like that it had a hook in it!"", Carl to gopher ""Don't mind me, I'm just a harmless squirrel, not a plastic explosive or something"", and on and on. There's great physical comedy, especially when Rodney goes berzerk with his massive yacht, crashing into anything and everything in sight, and Ted Knight, whose eyes seem to bulge of of their sockets at least once a minute. In short, it's a comic classic that was hilarious 20 years ago, and is still funny every time I watch it now. A must see!  10 out of 10",Caddyshack
95,eddiez61,"As Far As Inane Juvenile Golf Comedies Go, It Wears The Green Jacket!",10,9 April 2011,"Critics and reviewers and people in general too often forget what is the best standard by which to judge a comedy film. In fact, it's the only standard. Is it funny? That's it. There's the whole of it, the single attribute that I took into consideration in assessing this film's cinematic value. I didn't debate it's social relevance. I didn't consider it's plot coherence. I didn't compare and contrast the individual actor's performances to previous ones of the genre. As far as I know, there had never before been a profound critique of the insidious contemporary American class structure in the guise of an absurd sports parody. And there probably still isn't, this movie just couldn't care less about making an intelligent point. It's only purpose is to be funny, and at this humble, meager task it's a soaring triumph. It is a friggin' non stop laugh riot.There are so many iconic characters in this film that occupy such grand, imposing positions in the imaginations of appreciative fans; Ted Knight's outrageously pompous Judge Elihu Smails, Chevy Chase's irresistibly charismatic Ty Webb, Rodney Dangerfield's ridiculously gauche Al Czervik, and Bill Murray's sublimely revolting but adorable assistant grounds keeper Carl Spackler. Scarcely a day passes without me encountering someone, somewhere, either in person or on TV, attempting their version of Carl's quirky, crooked mouthed mumbled slurred speech. It's as ubiquitous and as irksome as an amateur reading of Shakespeare, but somehow more permissible. Bad Shakespeare is rarely just silly. The last two generations of comedy film fans have been the beneficiaries to an incalculable degree of Caddyshack's influence. Our culture is now infused with the blithe spirit of this preposterous film. It's certainly not the most profound cinematic experience of my life, but it is one of the most purely entertaining.If the broad, slapstick nonsense isn't your cup of tea, then maybe you revel in the torrent of old-timey one liners, or admire the quick, witty dialog, especially that delivered by an enviably confident Chevy. Perhaps the refreshingly frank and genuinely sensitive relationship between Michael O'Keefe's Danny Noonan and Sarah Holcomb's Maggie O'Hooligan holds some attraction for you. Or maybe, like me, you're just an enthusiastic devotee of dancing gophers. Whatever your taste, there's got to be at least something here to take you to that special place in your heart - that secret golf course of the soul - where Fun & Games are fine and respectable endeavors.

Rodney Dangerfield's opening lines and battles with Ted Knight made me laugh out loud, as well as Bill Murray's famous battle with the gopher, and his scene with Chevy Chase smoking pot in his ""house."" While this is a funny movie, it was rather amazing to discover that many consider this a true comedy classic. Having not seen in it quite some time recently, I wanted to see if it was still the comedy classic I remembered it to be and if I agreed with the majority or if I thought it was more on the over- hyped side. Sad to say but the movie hasn't help up great 37 years later and I am leaning towards the latter side. Now I will admit Dangerfield's opening scenes, some of his other dialogue and screen time with Ted Knight is still very, very funny but looking back on it, that's only in the first half of the movie and towards the end it's a shtick that just gets tiresome and less funny. Knight on his own really doesn't bring the movie any extra momentum. His role seems more recycled from his days as Ted Baxter on the Mary Tyler Moore Show. It seems like the movie thinks it's still funny for others to put down and insult his character in the same way Ted Baxter was put down for being such an egotistical annoying pest, but it was only funny the first time, and Knight doesn't do anything different or special with his role here. Murray, who many people quote his dialogue from this movie to this present day is also really not given any opportunity to do anything special. He has a couple of funny moments with the gopher, but those really bring more of a chuckle than a genuine laugh, and his ""Cinderella Story"" scene which is put on lists of the all time greatest movie quotes is worthy of a slight chuckle but that's about it. There is nothing special about it to be on the list of the all-time greats. Murray's only laugh out loud moment was when he disinfected the pool and ate the Baby Ruth bar. And then the movie has subplots about caddy scholarships, yacht clubs, out of wedlock pregnancy and none of it seems to really quite blend well enough to do the plot any justice. Chevy Chase has one or two genuinely funny lines, but outside of that his character is really more of an underdeveloped and awkward distraction more than anything else. Michael O'Keefe who was wonderful with Robert Duvall in The Great Santini is wasted and also,sadly, an underdeveloped character. I guess he is supposed to provide support to the main comic stars, but his character is just another missed opportunity which could have made the movie funnier. I wonder if some think this is such a classic because of Dangerfield's funny bits. Were it not for him this movie would have totally sucked and been long forgotten. Because of him I am feeling nice enough to give it a modest 6. He was far better six years later in Back to School which Ramis co-wrote, that script had a far better use of his talent. Murray and Ramis fared better the following year in Stripes which holds up far better than this one does and eventually Groundhog Day over a decade later, and Chase and Ramis fared far better in National Lampoon's Vacation three years later. That's why I can't understand considering that Ramis made much funnier movies with the main stars of this one, why this one is considered the all-time classic, while the others don't come close to having the same status. This was Ramis' directorial debut and Dangerfield's first major movie so it was a good warm-up for them but they made much better movies later on. All in all Caddyshack is vaguely funny, but there is essentially no story, too many distracting, meaningless subplots, some of which are totally irrelevant to the so-called ""plot"" and only one truly funny main character (Dangerfield's). So while it definitely didn't deserve the poor reviews it got upon original release, it also shouldn't be considered the classic it is nowadays. 37 years later it's mildly amusing with a few funny moments worthy of a couple smiles and one or two genuinely laugh out loud moments. Even Happy Gilmore which some critics described as a Caddyshack wannabe is funnier and I think is more worthy of classic comedy status. So if you want to see if Caddyshack is the classic they say it is or if you want to see if it's held up to that standard 37 years later you will be disappointed. If you're just expecting a few chuckles to kill some time you won't be.",Caddyshack

114,Rick-34,yes a classic,9,21 August 2003,"Caddyshack is (a) the funniest sports comedy ever, and (b) possibly the funniest movie of the 80s.  Perhaps one had to be a teenager in the 80s to really appreciate the brilliance of this movie.  But I can recall no other movie that had four comedians at the top of their games - Dangerfield, Murray, Chase, and Knight all are excellent.  And none of them is the ""lead character""! 
The classic moments of this movie include Carl Spackler recounting his trip to Tibet caddying for the Dalai Lama (""Gunga galunga, no.., gunga gunga lagunga""), the ""Cinderella story"", the caddies shouting ""miss it Noonan, miss it"", the ""doodie"", the Havercamps, the betting on whether ""the Smails kid picks his nose"", Ty Webb's golf lessons for Danny Noonan, and the many confrontations between Al Czervik and Judge Smails...the list goes on and on.Definitely a movie that stands the test of time.

Dangerfield was the funniest to me, but honestly, this movie was just NOT funny! animal house and this are probably the 2 most overrated stupid dumb movies I've ever seen! i don't watch comedies a lot because most ""modern"" comedies are nothing but crude offensive humor. caddyshack isn't the worst in this regard but its just so....stupid. so stupid that its not funny. my dad loves this movie, he can quote it for crying out loud! but i found it just plain bad. the fact that Harold ramis wrote and directed these makes it even worse! i love that guy, especially as Egon, and i loved his other movies like groundhog day and analyze this, and vacation and stripes were pretty good too, and of course ghostbusters 1 and 2, but his ""early"" films were really just banal fare for the 12-16 year old crowd who find potty jokes funny.",Caddyshack
116,britishdominion,One Of The Funniest Comedies Of All Time!,10,6 February 2005,"Crudeness doesn't come much more, well, crude, than 1980's sublime ""Caddyshack"". In fact, this crazy quilt takes the slob groundwork laid by ""National Lampoon's Animal House"" and one-ups that collegiate comedy classic by having a carelessly mean, anarchic spirit a mile wide and a foot deep. It's little surprise that writer/director Harold Ramis and co-writer Douglas Kenney were also scribes on that 1978 John Belushi hit. As ""Caddyshack"" shows, the classic us-versus-them scat-humor template is alive and well. But this is not just a crass comedy, it's a HAPPILY crass comedy, that does just about whatever it wants as it casually wanders through it's 90-odd minutes. The DNA of ""Caddyshack"" resides somewhere in the cinematic in-between world of the aforementioned ""Animal House"" and a Three Stooges or W.C. Fields picture. There's a giddiness to its nose-thumbing, and a general pleasure in its coarse eagerness to offend.The screenplay forms a functional spine for what actually amounts to a comedy collision course of witty asides, broad physical comedy, dirty jokes, varied comedic styles and big explosions.But is there really a screenplay here? The film has such a loose and free-wheeling timbre to it that it would be hard not to fault the viewer in thinking that the film was largely improvised, or at least rewritten by committee on set, scene by scene.This film was widely *rumoured* to be ""under the influence"" during shooting, but whatever the cast and crew were ""using"" seemed to work very much in favor of movie, as the flick turned out to be editorially messy and open-structured, yet well-paced and coherent enough to embrace the variety of comedic opinions squeezed into the picture. This is what you get - a smörgåsbord of laughs. You get a Chevy Chase doing his ironic bit, you have one Bill Murray essaying a bizarre-o mental case, good old Ted Knight going into slow-burn histrionics every scene, and Rodney Dangerfield stealing every scene with large chunks of his stand-up act. This shouldn't work, this mix - but it does. Very well. Again, the looseness of the pace and tone of the film forgive some of the storytelling framework featuring young go-getter Michael O'Keefe's attempt to get a college scholarship during one crazy summer caddying for Bushwood Country Club's weirdest members. Instead, Ramis, Kenney and (Bill's brother) Brian Doyle Murray set each of these comedians up with sketch-like scenarios for some of their finest and funniest work.The movie is mean in all the right places - It's the snobs against the slobs, as the advertising says. ""Caddyshack"" takes barbed pot-shots at the class system, at sex, at religion, at bodily functions. No joke is too risqué, no candy bar too gross to eat from the bottom of a empty pool. It has lots of swearing, nudity for nudity's sake, and insults for the pompous and pathetic. Even through its R-rated mean-spiritedness, it's hard to truly be turned off of the film's antagonistic spirit - it earns it's laughs because it's breathlessly paced and damned funny. This is the thematic mold that the Farrellys and Adam Sandler rarely get right. ""Caddyshack"" is endlessly quotable, and surely if you sat around with a few friends anytime in the last 25 years, you could probably spend a good hour reciting lines and scenes that still hold all their glorious funny these many years later. The movie's best scene? My award goes to the ""Night Putting"" sequence where Chevy Chase's Ty Webb and Bill Murray Carl the Greenskeeper finally meet up when Chase fires a Titleist through the window of Murray's lean-to shed-slash-residence. This never fails to get big laughs, and it's a real meeting of the minds. A great sequence for the Comedy Hall of Fame, I'd say. Kenny Loggins' catchy songs (""I'm Alright"" anyone?) and the jazzy Johnny Mandel (!) orchestral score add a unexpectedly lovely sheen that spit-shines the crudity of subject and filmmaker's style. They're nice touches.You can put ""Caddyshack"" next to ""Casablanca"" or ""Citizen Kane"" - not just in the ""C"" section of your local video store, but as in ""Classic"". Comedies don't come much funnier than this. BTW - skip ""Caddyshack II"". Everything that this one is, that one isn't.",Caddyshack
117,sterlinrivera-2000,Truly a Classic,10,2 September 2019,"Caddyshack is without a doubt a big classic. It still holds up nearly 40 years later, has a very awesome cast, the comedy is brilliant, and has a very good working story.Caddyshack is about a teen, Danny (played by Michael O'Keefe) that works as a caddy at a country club to raise money for his college education. He decides to caddy for a club member, Judge Eilhu Smalls (played by Ted Knight) and gets advice and help from a wealthy golfer Ty (played by Chevy Chase) in order to win the upcoming Caddy Day golf tournament before a rude millionaire, Al (played by Rodney Dangerfield), wants to purchase the country club.Meanwhile, there is a pesky gopher going around the golf course and creating havoc. The club's groundskeeper, Carl (played by Bill Murray) is given the task to take out the rodent and just so happens that the gopher is smarter than he thinks.Caddyshack is a great film. The cast is top notch. You got great comedians like Bill Murray, Rodney Dangerfield, and Chevy Chase together and they were all pretty funny. Ted Knight may not of been a comedian, but he still did a great job. I think the best parts of the film were with the gopher. It just has that classic slapstick humor that many people were used to back then, and even though this film is rated R, the gopher scenes are the only scenes that both kids and adults can watch and laugh at, but the rest is all fun for adults.The story was also straight forward and basic. Not confusing at all, and the pacing went in a great pace.Overall, Caddyshack is hands down a big classic that never gets old.",Caddyshack

To the people that didn't find this movie funny, you obviously have no sense of humor at all. Everyone who likes this movie, you know what I am talking about. This is a classic and one of the best line-ups of all time. Dangerfield and Murray Stole the whole show.Chase, best line: ""My father never liked you.""Dangerfield comes out with the funniest jokes you ever heard: ""The last time I saw a mouth like that, it had a hook in it"" and so many other lines that had tears in my eyes.To the folks on here who criticize the movie as being low-brow and not as sophisticated as other movies: please, spare me your high-brow condescension. I enjoy those films as much as the next guy, same with the Mel Brooks films, which are also brilliant. There are all different types of humor, different types of funny characters.

Bill can chase a gopher, smash a camellia, or snorkel after a tur er ""Snicker"" bar like few comedians since the Keystone Kops. Rodney Dangerfield is the most obnoxious golfer (wait, is that redundant?) you've ever seen. Dangerfield coined one of the all time funny movie lines, ""Now I know why tigers eat their young."" Harold Ramis is at his directing best here. Although the co-starring gopher is a bit awkward. It would be interesting to see him with today's technology. This movie spawns a good time for all. See it with someone who loves you and prepare for sore cheeks. It's hard to believe that this was made twenty years ago.",Caddyshack

122,lucifer,Whoo-hoo!,7,20 March 2002,"Having already seen the risible Caddyshack II (1988), and knowing that the original was supposed to better, I settled down with an unspecified amount of alcohol of unknown origin to watch. Was the alcohol necessary? Given the state of the sequel, methinks it was.Thankfully, there were enough laughs in this to make it worth the effort. Sure, the story's rubbish, but then, the story ain't the point here.Chevy Chase is his usual hapless self here, which is funny in itself (unlike many of his films, sadly - where's the SNL Chevy gone? Methinks he needs to fall down some stairs again). Rodney Dangerfield steals the show with some disgraceful one-liners. Sadly his own films milked this, and aren't as good.Bill Murray puts in a fine showing as a psychotic gardener under orders to destroy the gophers. Isn't the gopher ridiculously cute?Oh, some girls take their clothes off, which is never a bad thing.The film does meander around the different plot lines, but they somehow manage to fit together at the end. Well done, Egon!The Scottish Head Groundskeeper is a disgraceful stereo type (this would be where Groundskeeper Willy comes from - naughty Groening), but he's only on screen for 5 minutes.For those of you interested, this film is the reason that Journey's ""Any Way You Want It"" gets played at the end of the episode of The Simpsons where Rodney Dangerfield plays Mr Burns' son, Larry.

123,mullermike,It pains me to say it but this film is dated,6,28 May 2006,"I recently watched Caddyshack for the first time in years. I loved it years ago and still quote it today. Before viewing, I told my brother I was gonna rent it. After all, I hadn't seen it since college. He said ""dude, this movie hasn't aged well."" I retorted with a quick ""you're crazy."" This is Caddyshack, one of THE all time great comedies. A modern day comedic masterpiece according to everyone, including myself. In a past review about Used Cars, I even marveled about how it's jokes had aged well, whereas UC had lost it's edge.About an hour into it, I realized ""oh my God, my brother is right."" The film isn't just dated because of the polyester, unkempt hair and short shorts. The jokes simply aren't as funny. Lines that I regularly quote didn't hold up. I can't tell you the disappointment I experienced in learning this. First of all, I'm a huge fan of Rodney Dangerfield. And some of his lines are quotable, even from this movie. But many of his antics simply haven't held up. Other Dangerfiled films like Back to School have aged much better. Then again, I haven't watched it in a few years, maybe it's lost it's humor. It did have William Zabka, the poster child of 80s blond haired goons. So who knows.I never cared about the plot of this movie. Neither did Harold Ramis. It's basically about the vastly different members at a country club. It's character driven, not plot based, and gag ridden. And some of the jokes are fun to quote with friends. But hearing them during the movie will not make you laugh. Even on DVD, the film just hasn't aged well. It really feels low budget.I don't want to get in depth about this movie. Nearly everyone on earth has seen it. The writing is good, Harold Ramis knew what he was doing. And watching it, I could see the similarities with this and Animal House. Ramis didn't direct AH but the music in each was similar. And each movie really had no plot. But whereas Animal House still gets the party going, Caddyshack seems hopelessly antiquated. Seriously, picking your boogers and eating em? The Baby Ruth in a swimming pool? That was funny when everyone was saying ""sike.""Having said that, there's no denying Caddyshacks place in film history. It showed the screen talent of Dangerfield to a new generation. It catapulted the careers of Chevy Chase and Bill Murray (who supposedly disliked each other). Plus some of the one liners, though a bit mean-spirited, are still being quoted by the kids. But watching the film, it's just not as captivating. I don't know if there's really a way of preventing that. You make a movie with material that's funny at the time. Styles and humor are gonna change, so it's hard to know what will be funny in 10, 20, 30 years. I'll always have a special place in my heart for Caddyshack. I spent many nights watching it with friends, so it has nostalgic value. And I'll forever love Dangerfield, Murray and Chase (until he became unfunny). Yet after seeing how dated it is, I'll never watch it again. I'm simply gonna remember Caddyshack for what it was years ago. Not how it looks today.",Caddyshack

I think it is incredible that such a meager script could end up getting made. In the 21st century, a film like Caddyshack - or even a comedy a level or two above it - would be painfully dull. The really amazing thing is that two of the finest comedic actors of the time, i.e. Chevy Chase and Bill Murray, fail to save the day.

Especially as an adult, it takes more than silly teenage ""humour"" for a film to make me laugh (or even just smile). Generally I prefer politically incorrect movies and themes, so I did a search for such. For some weird reason, this movie came up on a few lists.No idea why. Unfortunately stupidity and childishness are neither illegal nor politically incorrect anywhere in the world, especially not in America. Certainly back in the 70's and 80's when American cinema was a good reflection of their isolated, insular society. Not much unique or smart came out of Hollywood in those times.This stuff is as unfunny as Adam Sandler or Will Ferrell. Quality comedy requires important topics and relateable characters first and foremost. The best comedy makes you cry and laugh at the same time.

Now a little older, a little wiser, and the film even older it comes across as outdated and muddled, with very little to recommend it to the first-time viewer.Sure, some jokes still work and the performances of both Murray and Dangerfield still manage to raise a smile, but the disjointed plot-less storyline irritates and the puerility of some of the gags is quite unbelievable.The format chosen by the SNL crew is understandable but the failure to develop (or even look into) the characters to any degree leaves a clumsy, confused mess that literally feels like watching an extended run of standalone (mediocre) sketches all cobbled into one.The late seventies/early eighties brought about many teen comedies (Porky's, Animal House, etc.) that have passed the test of time.

133,tommythek,The best ever? Duh .....,7,2 November 2001,"I FINALLY got around to watching this movie in its entirety. I'd seen bits and pieces of it over the years but never the whole thing all at once. Proud of being the snob that I am, I always considered ""Caddyshack"" to be about 20 floors beneath my cultured dignity.Having seen it, I now have come to IMDb to vote on it and to comment on it. I've noticed, first, that a few commenters think this is the best movie ever made. Or, at the very least, the best COMEDY ever made. Conversely, 6,262 voters (to date, counting me) rate this movie at only 6.9 out of 10. Which means that the ""silent majority"" think ""Caddyshack"" is just an OK movie. And I'm with the latter group. ""Caddyshack"" does have its moments, a few of them quite funny, but overall, it's just OK.Let's face it. There are only four people in this movie: Chevy Chase, Rodney Dangerfield, Ted Knight and Bill Murray. All the other actors and actresses who are in it, young and old alike, are thrown in just to fill in empty holes in the screen. Or to say something when all of The Big Four are debating among themselves as to who has the next one-liner. And usually it's Dangerfield, who tosses out one-liners as if he's throwing rice at a wedding. Most people would probably say his character (Al Czervik) is the funniest in this movie. Not say me. My vote goes to Bill Murray (Carl Spackler -- what a name!), who plays an absolutely insane assistant keeper of the greensward at the uppity Bushwood Country Club. This guy couldn't get a clue if Vanna White herself were handing them out for free, which makes his character all the more lovable in this movie.There is one classic scene where Chevy Chase (Ty Webb), in preparation for an important match upcoming with the snooty Judge Smails (Ted Knight), is working on his golf game -- in the middle of the night! He accidentally knocks his ball into Spackler's -- uh -- ""living quarters."" In the course of attempting to get Spackler's permission to ""play thru,"" the two of them have the most inane conversation you could possibly imagine.I can imagine that Brian Doyle-Murray (Bill's brother), Harold Ramis and Douglas Kenney, the three co-writers, must have had great fun writing the script (such as it is) for this movie. I can picture the three of them, in many late-night writing sessions, trying to top each other's one-liners -- and the more lowbrow the one-liners, the better.Though the movie does have, as I've said, some funny lines and scenes, it is mostly just a ""cut-and-run"" from one scene to the next -- unrelated -- gag or scene. If one appreciates a COMPLETE movie of this type -- and from this era (1980ish, give or take a few) -- one would do much better with the likes of ""Animal House,"" ""Airplane"" or ""Ghostbusters.""Don't forget! ""Caddyshack"" is the type of movie that attracts those people who are attracted to the lowbrow in almost anything. The ""Best Ever"" movie? No. The ""Best Comedy Ever""? I don't think so. Remember, those members of the cultured intelligentsia, such as myself, rarely stoop to the level of a ""Caddyshack."" It really is beneath us. But if one does so stoop, one will actually find a few laughs therein. What a surprise!",Caddyshack
134,Kilroy5150,Funny movie.,6,15 April 2020,"Honestly, i saw the documentary and i think the behind the scenes was more entertaining than the actual movie. I mean, it was funny but it seemed to be more about the caddy's person shortcomings than anything else.You've got Cindy Morgan (who's DESPERATE to be noticed by everyone), the Chachi (from Happy Days) knock-off, a bunch of kids with single lines that just weren't that funny.Then you've got Chevy Chase & Rodney Dangerfield, who practically stole the movie from the original main character ""Danny"". And finally, you've got Bill Murray, who is in a class all by himself and was hilarious from start to finish, especially with Chase during the weed bit.And Harold Ramis figured out, early into the filming, that the whole movie was going to center around Chase, Dangerfield, and Murray no matter what he intended.The movie was, do doubt, funny but there were a lot of dead spots in it that you were just waiting to get back to the main 3 attractions.",Caddyshack
135,Jynne,Hilarious!,10,9 November 2000,"I have fond memories of this movie--it's one of my all-time favorites, especially of the ""slobs vs. snobs"" genre.

136,lucasespindola-91322,Never gets old,9,3 April 2021,"How can a movie so simple be so good? Well, terrific comedians with some great content, that's how.Yes, Murray's ad libs are probably some of the best genuine moments of comedy ever put to film. But that's Bill Murray we are talking about, one of the naturally funniest people to ever walk this Earth. So yes, when you give him space and an off the wall script, he's going to kill it.But that's not all. This is such a funny flick that Murray, for the most part, doesn't even stand out. Chevy Chase and Micahel O'Keefe deliver some of the funniest moments of the movie with so little effort that it is understandable if you forget that you are watching a movie.Watch it.",Caddyshack
137,F0RCE,You're crazy if you didn't love this film.,8,24 March 2001,"""Caddyshack"" is one of the greatest comedies ever produced.  This film is spirited and smart and is written in the tradition of National Lampoon. Harold Ramis is one of the funniest and most intelligent film makers of our time.  Add to this the writing abilities of Brian Doyle-Murray and Doug Kenney and you have creative ability that has yet to be matched.  Of course there is the all-star cast reminiscent of the Second City and Saturday Night Live.  Chase is hilarious without trying to be, and Bill Murray is terrific playing a part that suits him well.  Rodney Dangerfield and Ted Knight are very talented actors and make the film what it is.  A great supporting cast including Michael O'Keefe and Cindy Morgan are also a key to success.  This film has it all, a great story, hilarious yet simple humor, and a cast that is one of the best ever assembled for this type of film.  ""Caddyshack"" is an undying film that should be and will be enjoyed by generations to come.  It captures the spirit of Ramis and the other film makers that defined the early to mid '80's film-making.",Caddyshack
138,cmeneken-1,Can't believe this garbage has same rating as My Cousin Vinny,1,18 June 2010,"I saw about ten minutes of this on TV tonight, hearing that it was funny. Whew! Directed by one of Hollywood's middle school geeks, Harold Ramis, this film was an attempt, it would appear, to make a film for 12 year old boys with collective IQs about as high as a gopher. It was gross without being funny, a disgusting performance by Dangerfield, supported by Chevy's and Bill Murray's worst performances of all their movies. The rest of the cast was pathetic. The real question is, how could anyone, I mean anyone--over 12--admire this film. Its rated as 73, the same as the finest American comedy of the last 30 years, ""My Cousin Vinny"". All I can say is I agree with Bill Maher, America is filled with idiots.",Caddyshack
139,diamondarrow,Pretty funny.,7,13 August 2021,I wouldn't say this movie had me laughing out loud but it did have some funny moments in. I did think this film was gonna be mainly about the Gofer but that was only really a side plot until the end. This isn't one of my favorite comedy movies but it was fun to watch.,Caddyshack
140,Brian_E_Watters,I Wish More Comedies Were This Good,9,21 October 2009,"This movie is absolutely funny, and there is no question about it. Not only that, but there are so many good performances here... everyone is funny! Not a big fan of the silly groundhog or whatever it was, but if not for that useless furry robot, we would not have seen one of the funniest performances ever (Bill Murray). Perfect. You have no choice but to like the way he acts in this movie. It's stupidity in the best way humanly possible.If you haven't seen this, and you like silly comedies, you really must see it. It's a classic. Yeah, it's old, but it will always be funny even for first-time viewers.",Caddyshack
141,dixie-18,Still funny in 2006!,10,8 March 2006,"I just watched it again, and it is just as funny as ever. Yes it is a cousin of ANIMAL HOUSE, but it also a child (or grandchild) of the Marx Brothers. This film works for many reasons: The cast is a strange mixture, but each cast member is riot. Many say Bill Murray steals the show, and it is hard to dispute, but Murray was pretty new to the movies then, and so was Rodney Dangerfield. Bill was hot from Saturday Night Live and Rodney was still primarily still doing stand up. Ted Knight was famous from the Mary Tuler Moore Show, but not really known for feature films. Chevy Chase, in my opinion, was a supporting player, as was Michael O'Keefe, and Sarah Holcomb. This was Harold Ramis' first time as director, and he really delivered. Ramis also had a writing credit,and he was really on a roll at that time....ANIMAL HOUSE in 1978, CADDYSHACK in 1980, STRIPES in 1981, and GHOST BUSTERS in 1984. These four films are among the best comedies Hollywood offered in the 1970s and 80s! I recently saw Ramis discuss this film and he remarked how difficult it would normally be to direct 4 such strong comedians in same film, but he also remarked how great each was, and how professional they were.",Caddyshack
142,FirstNameLastName24,Maybe this was funny in 1980...,2,9 June 2020,"Caddyshack fails as a movie on all fronts: plot, pacing, character development, etc. It fails to be a compelling film on any level. Some would argue, however, that Caddyshack is first and foremost a comedy, and none of those things really matter as long as the film is funny, and I would agree 100%; I would be willing to overlook all of the movie's shortcomings if it managed to make me laugh. Unfortunately, Caddyshack commits the ultimate crime that a comedy movie can commit: it's simply not funny. Most of the jokes are far too dated to be effective, and the few jokes that actually make sense are poorly written and don't land. The only scenes I found remotely amusing were those with the groundhog puppet (hence the 2 stars instead of 1). Now, before you accuse me of not having a sense of humor or failing to understand ""real comedy"", I can present you several comedies from the 70s and 80s that are still hilarious today: Monty Python's Holy Grail and The Jerk are two perfect examples of decades-old comedies that are unscathed by time. Please do yourself a favor and watch those movies instead.",Caddyshack
143,lkeenan1,It's a Cinderella Story...,9,20 January 2002,"I have seen this movie numerous times, and each time I laugh just as loud at the same stupid lines that I did before. Although Rodney Dangerfield, Chevy Chase(I'm not usually a big fan of his, but he rocks here)and Ted Knight(one of the best comedic actors of his time, in my opinion) are hysterical, the movie really belongs to Bill Murray. The scene where he and the priest are out playing golf in the monsoon-because the good lord wouldn't rain on the best game of the father's life-is one of the funniest I've ever seen, and the thought of the goofy groundskeeper asking the Dalai Lama for a tip is making me laugh right now (""So I said, hey, Lama, how about something for the effort?"")Even 22 years later, the script (if not the 'dos) is timeless.If you haven't seen it, please do so immediately. If you like comedy at a fast pace, you won't be disappointed!",Caddyshack

There isn't enough praise you can give this movie, from the millions of classic one line jokes, to just the overall performances. There's the old saying, they just don't make them like this anymore. And that applies to this gem. Even the small characters like Spalding are funny as heck. When is the last time you saw this many funny actors in one movie. Never.. Egos were put aside to put this great movie together. From a great soundtrack, to just the overall chemistry of the cast. You can't do any better than this. And for all the total morons and newbs out there that gave this anything less than an 8- Go home.

145,kezop_male,Classic Screwball Comedy Stands Test of Time,10,20 September 2006,"Just finished watching this movie with my 16 year son, who was skeptical about it after seeing modern day screwball comedies like ""Old School."" He loved it.Unlike at least one other reviewer, I thought Chevy Chase was great through-out the movie. With all the over the top comedy through-out the movie, it's easy to miss Chevy with Ted Knight and Rodney Dangerfield's over the top performances. Chevy clearly has some of the best lines, delivered so off-the-cuff as to be easily missed.Bill Murray may be at his comedic best in this movie playing underplaying an over-the-top character with great effect. He's so funny, it's easy to spend your time watching this movie in eager anticipation of when he'll again be on screen.Rodney Dangerfield is classic Rodney Dangerfield in a part that had to be written just for him. Much of his schtick is just as tired as Rodney looks, but all is delivered with his usual ""I've got a squirrel in my pants"" style. If you're a fan of Rodney, there's lots to like about him in the movie. If you hate him, though, be warned: his screen time will wear on you like nails on a chalkboard.Ted Knight in a pseudo-Ted Baxter performance fits his role perfectly. If you grew up watching him on the Mary Tyler Moore show, you'll get more of the same.Michael O'Keefe and Tony D'Annunzio play good counterpoints to each other in underdeveloped, but clichéd roles of ""average nice guy"" and ""hip, cool guy"" to Cindy Morgan's smokin' hot chick. (She is gorgeous!) Sarah Holcomb's Irish looks and accent are a joy. Too bad this was her last film.Plenty of great characters with at least six or more mixed up plot lines held loosely together by the golfing theme and intersecting liberally. The setting automatically excuses most of the dating of the movie. Hey, everyone knows golfers have no fashion sense.",Caddyshack

From ""You owe me one gumball machine"" to ""You buy a hat like this you get a free bowl of soup with it"", I have the dialogue from this film embedded in my brain. First saw this movie on a network TV showing in 1982 or 1983 and watched it countless times.  Only recently (1994) did I finally see it uncut and the stuff I didn't know about just made the film greater.  All the comedians are at their very best - and no one ever mentions how great Ted Knight is in this!! Even the soundtrack is excellent!  I ain't payin' 50 cents for no Coke!",Caddyshack
147,The_Sceptic,It's The Rodney Dangerfield Show!,7,21 August 2002,"Zany events take place in and around an exclusive golf course. I like this film for 3 things only- Rodney, Rodney and Rodney. He takes every opportunity he gets to crack a one-liner: ""He called me a baboon, thinks I'm his wife"". You're just waiting for Dangerfield to come on again just so the film can pick up.I was very disappointed with Bill Murray, while I understand hardcore 'shack fans loved him in this role, I didn't. He's a DEADPAN comedian, his scenes especially were just silly and dumb. Which might have been alright if they were funny. I loved Bill Murray in Ghostbusters, but to see him stoop this low, trying to make a joke out of hunting a gopher, was embarrassing.My advice would be to just fast forward to the scenes that have Dangerfield or the Judge (the late Ted Knight) in them. There the only two guys in this film who get my respect!",Caddyshack
148,jowidag,The absolute worst movie I have ever seen.,1,23 February 2001,"I hated this movie.  I sat down with my best friend and got ready to laugh my heart out, but by the end of the movie, I realized I hadn't laughed once. The jokes were lame, the plot was boring, the whole gopher thing was cheesy, and some of the scenes were downright disgusting.  I usually think Bill Murray is funny, but there he was doing his usual dumb guy routine while Rodney Dangerfield was delivering those dumb jokes (which, by the way, I could actually feel the silence and humiliation you get after you say something stupid).  I could not believe how pathetic it was.  My friend kept trying to get me to laugh but I couldn't even force myself to.",Caddyshack
149,Buggieblade,A Showcase of comic talents,8,6 July 2002,"I found Caddyshack to be a movie comprised of great comedic performances. Rodney Dangerfield shines as a big-shot land developer taking in some golf at a snooty country club.  Ted Knight gives an applaudable 'straight man' performance enhancing the timing of the comedians around him.  Bill Murray is classic as the 'assistant grounds-keeper' who is at war with the only real setback of the film, the childish but low-key Mr. Gopher. This comedy classic has earned a well deserved spot in my movie collection and I recommend it as a worthy purchase.Buggie",Caddyshack

Having him Recite ""Be The Ball"" Classic!Dangerfield with Cracking the funniest Jokes i ever heard ""The last time i saw a mouth like that, it had a hook in it"" and So many other Jokes that had my rolling on the floor.Murray, his persistance on getting that Damn Gofer. Classic and of course, two of the most Famous Speeches ever heard in a Comedy. The Dali Lama Speech and the Agusta Nation open Speech. ""the second one by the way was complete Im-prov!""The overall Storyline was pretty good, but just about all comedys nail that on the mark.

151,wayofthecass,A very funny summer golf comedy.,7,12 October 2007,"The film has some great moments and is possibly one of the most ad-libbed pictures of all time. Chevy Chase, in one of his first film roles, gives us a taste of his great comic turn in 'Fletch'(1985) with the off-beat portrayal of club pro Tye Webb. Chase is really untouchable when it comes to playing funny-straight characters. Bill Murray is hilarious as grounds keeper Carl Spackler. Murray has improvised just about all of his dialogue and it really is superb. His 'Cinderella Story' scene, followed by caddying for the Bishop in the thunder storm is one of the funniest things i've seen on screen.Rodney Dangerfield is somewhat hit and miss. All of his dialogue is quick fire one-liners so the chances are that when he does crack a funny joke you'll be so busy laughing that you'll miss the next one. The funniest one in my book is his retort to caddy Tony D'Annunzio: 'Hey kid, when are you due back in boy's town?' For me Ted Knight steals the picture as Judge Smails. He is such an energetic over the top character. His constant put downs of grandson Spallding , 'You'll get nothing and like it!', and random acts of frustrated violence supplied constant entertainment.The question is...why didn't the film just focus completely on these guys? Instead it kept on harping back to Danny Noonan. Michael O'Keefe is a fine actor but he was always going to struggle in a comedy which featured the above cast members and characters. Another handicap is that in a comedy he gets few comedic lines. His character's relationship with his girlfriend Maggie, played inexplicably with a terrible Irish accent, and with his own family are highly under developed. Cindy Morgan is also given an extremely under written character who's motives are never explained and who randomly comes in and out of the film. Harold Ramis's direction is at times sloppy and echoes his then inexperience. He did go on to do 'Groundhog Day'(1993) though so he obviously learned his lessons.To sum up this is a good film to get you in the mood for the summer. Lots of beautiful weather covering some splendid golf course scenery. There are plenty of likable characters and some very funny set pieces. Its also interesting to see the launch pad for some of the 80s biggest comedic stars. But be warned if you don't like Chase, Murray or Dangerfield then don't waste your time on this. Along with Knight, the film really is their show. For further evidence to support the final sentence just look at the poster.",Caddyshack

At that time I said it was the worst of my 200 DVD's and the worst film I'd ever seen.  The only thing I'd like to add to that is that I now have 500 DVD's and it's still BY FAR the worst film I've EVER seen.I'm a mad keen golfer and love a laugh so it's not the topic or a sense of humour that elude me.  It's the cringeworthy attempts at jokes, the dreadful acting, the B movie feel and so on.  Scarily bad.

If, on the other hand, you are in possession of an intellect somewhat in excess of a wobbling jelly, steer clear - you'll only waste 90 minutes of your life, and life's for living, it's not a rehearsal.This is just not funny.  My wife was ducking from the sheer embarrassment of the repeated vain attempts at humour.  She went to her bed half way through. I was curious enough just to see how bad it got so staked it out, but it was tough going.I love comedy films and own 750 DVD's.  This, though, is just utter pash.

156,nickyjohnp,Oh the 80s,10,28 October 2017,"Caddyshack started out as a National Lampoon's Animal House-like movie. Caddyshack has so many classic scenes like the pool scenes, the ""hey everybody we're all gonna get laid"" scene, and the gopher.Harold Ramis made his directorial debut also co-writing the film with Brian Doyle-Murray (Bill Murray's older brother) and with Douglas Kenney. Harold Ramis and Douglas Kenney both were writers for National Lampoon's Animal House. They had based the character of Danny Noonan and his family on the famous Murray family, and when creating the character Ty Webb, they had one person in mind for the job and they also semi-based it off him Chevy Chase. The movie at the time was the movie with the most crude humor, but that humor is now part of cinematic history along with Cindy Morgan who played ""the hot chick"" That every guy wants. Caddyshack established Rodney Dangerfield's acting career as before he did some stand-up comedy. But over the years people still remember his quote, ""Oh, this is the worst-looking hat I ever saw. What, when you buy a hat like this I bet you get a free bowl of soup, huh?"" As he played Al Czervik whose the obnoxious but lovable newcomer to the club. Bill Murray also largely contributed to the movie as the infamous Carl Spuckler, who in the sub-plot of the movie, is ordered by his Scottish boss to kill all the gopher's on the golf course. Bill Murray's character will make you start laughing from the beginning. Michael O'Keefe star's as the young Danny Noonan who is a teenager planing to go to college but can't afford it and is a caddie at the country club.",Caddyshack

I've read reviews here going into tiresome depth about why the movie isn't funny. That's the first problem. If you're spending a lot of time & energy to explain why you hate Caddyshack, you're probably a ton of fun in real life. The film is full of so many quotable lines, it's criminal. Everyone in the cast is perfect and if you're not laughing out loud, you're grinning till the end. Mostly, if you don't find Caddyshack funny, there's probably something wrong with you.

160,gotoads,Caddyshack - a comedy clasSUCK,2,3 November 2011,"I have figured out how this incredibly stupid film became regarded as a comedy ""classic"". In 1980, it had enough stars in it to gather a decent audience. However, it wasn't met with many positive reviews and probably would have faded into obscurity. Magically, this dopey film was perfectly timed to appear uncut on a new format for entertainment - cable TV. Back in the early 80s, HBO would show a handful of movies over and over and over again. Cable choices back them were extremely limited. Caddyshack was played to the saturation point and everybody would talk about it at school. Boys between the ages of 10 and 15, whose sense of humor was understandably shallow and stupid, were incredibly attracted to a film that contained bare boobies, inane bathroom humor and sarcastic quips. Caddyshack had this stuff, plus a mischievous, dancing gopher. Even the kids who hated it back then (like me) had to pretend they liked it for fear of being teased or ostracized by their peers. As time went by, young adults became nostalgic for the film they saw as kids, so they bought this on VHS and later DVD. The majority of people who have watched this in the past decade or two, realize it's complete crap but it brings backs memories of a more youthful, innocent time. Some individuals may legitimately enjoy it but it is clear that they are stoners or former stoners whose brains are completely fried. This is how utter rubbish became ""a classic"".",Caddyshack

I personally thought it was a very funny film and I would watch again. The whole cast knows what they are doing and they fit right in, particularly Chevy Chase, Rodney Dangerfield and Bill Murray (but everybody's good). Sure the humour is juvenile and immature at times but it's not supposed to be brilliant humour, it's supposed to be low-brow humour. All the people giving it a bad score probably were expecting brilliant humour. If you go into it expecting jokes to be layered and brilliant then you won't find much but if you go into it expecting low-brow, even dumb at times humour, you'll find it very funny. Overall though, I found it very funny and one of Chevy Chase's and Bill Murray's best performances. I recommend it for anybody who enjoys low-brow, cheap humour. 8/10.",Caddyshack
162,HoBopkins,don't forget Ted Knight and Michael O'Keefe,9,10 May 2006,"This movie is a classic. Not a perfect movie but it's a classic. A classic is a classic and this one is a classic. Okay I said the word classic enough, now to the point. Two actors in this film are often overlooked, but in fact they are the base of the film. One is Michael O Keefe, who is to this movie was Tim Matheson is to ""Animal House"", that is, he's the true star. Everything centers on him, he's likable and flows well with the ""good"" and the ""bad"" guys. Another overlooked genius is Ted Knight as Judge Smails. Ted plays the uptight villain with energy and you love to hate him and hate to love him. I can't stand comedies where they make the ""jerk"" a really unlikeable guy. John Vernon from ""Animal House"" was likable and was really fun to watch. Ted McKinley in ""Revenge of the Nerds"" was too. But there are some comedies where the bad guys are just bad people and it's no fun hating them. Anyhow, this review is just to point out this fact: that Rodney, Chevy and Bill are superb, but Michael and Ted are the base holding these bricks together. Scott Colomby, as the ""villian"" of the caddies, a cross between Matt Dillon and Scott Baio, is also quite good...

Caddyshack is the greatest comedy of all time.  Every minute of the film contains a gem.  Chevy Chase is perfect, the man I hope to be someday.  While most people remember Murray and Dangerfield, they are the least hilarious of the actors.If you happen to be one to knock this movie, you just don't get it, do you?  Well, why don't you just watch Titanic a couple more times anyhow.Subtlety is the reason this movie is not just a sophmoric piece of 80s recycling.  There is the silliness if that's what you need, but to fully appreciate it, you need to absorb the artistry of every little comment. The quirkiness, the awkward dialogue, and the recurring snapshots of honesty make it work for viewers seeking something more than a two hour collection of jokes.Following Danny, the straight man and lead character, you see how funny reality is for a poor white boy trying to be something more.  We all see how pointless the high life is eventually, and can then feel better about not being a member of a country club.I grew up on this movie, no less.  Please love it.",Caddyshack

168,jason-harre,Landscaping Changes,10,14 May 2003,"Caddyshack was distinctive in shedding light on the fact that it doesn't take a great script to produce an eminent movie. The film was originally planned out to be more oriented around the youthful character Danny, played by Michael O'Keefe.  Being Harold Ramis' directorial debut it was not shocking to see a slide of importance from the youthful Danny Noonan to his search for a male role-model.  The script claimed O'Keefe to be the main character; however he noticeably took a back seat to the slapstick comedic performances of Bill Murray, Rodney Dangerfield, Ted Knight, & Chevy Chase. 	With a cast of this irrepressible quality it was simple to adhere to the demands for improvisation and omitting lines for more comedic séances. O'Keefe's character Danny Noonan was still the essence of the film by bringing out teenage-life issues such as college and poor grades.  At Noonan's age, society and other forces create the need for a decision to be made about his future.  Much like most other teens he had no clue and was searching for guidance.  That guidance came through golfer Ty Webb who played more of a father figure role to Danny.  Comparatively, Danny favored Ty as a role model rather than his own father whom seemed more of a typically oppressive figure.  This was an important tie in with the audience because it is typically how all members of this age range view their parents in middle class suburbia. Even with a drastic changing of the tides with the script, O'Keefe could still be considered the star of the movie due to the fact that his character was the most sought after by the camera.  However, the big name comedians slated on top of him even on the cover-box, leading to a less successful future than at first he had aspired.  After Caddyshack, O'Keefe virtually fell of the face of Hollywood, only making minor appearances in some later blockbuster films such as The Pledge, Ghosts of Mississippi, and The Glass House.  Never having a truly successful independent starring role O'Keefe is still searching over twenty years since his first starring character as Danny Noonan. On the flip side of the spectrum Bill Murray's character became an icon for the picture when at first Carl Spackler was slated to have fewer lines than a sheet of notebook paper.  With Murray's uncanny ability to improve his Spackler took on a whole new dimension.  From the background into the foreground, Spackler became as popularly associated with Caddyshack as Smails, Webb, and Noonan.  As a result, Bill Murray's career outside of Saturday Night Live sky rocketed.  He went on to star in an esteemed list of films such as Stripes, Ghostbusters, What about Bob, Groundhog's Day, Rushmore, and many more.  Noonan's antagonist D'Azunnio was originally scripted as the second leading man.  However with Knight and Dangerfield grabbing attention with their non-stop hilarity he quickly sank into the shadows.  It was obvious that this film was a great success due to the improvisational skills of Knight, Murray, Dangerfield, and Chase. However the toll that was taken was to the careers of O'Keefe and his fellow youthful co-stars.  Personally, I am grateful though because a series of movies starring Bill Murray sound much more appealing than Michael O'Keefe. Then again, I guess we'll never know.",Caddyshack

With a rowdy real estate investor coming in to explore the possibility of buying out a snobby country club, the problems are bound to arrive.

The main focus of the film is a possibly college-bound caddy dealing with the insecurities of his future and how to make it all happen.  Now, forget the main focus, sit back and prepare for the hysterical show-stealing Rodney Dangerfield comically reduce the snobby elite (especially Ted Knight as a hateful, overbearing judge) to the butt of his greatest jokes (who has no respect for whom?).  Bill Murray is a classic crackup as the poor groundskeeper who meets his match in battle against the ultimate rodent, a pesky gopher (not golfer).

171,dru690,Great comedy,10,12 August 2000,"Caddyshack is definitely a great comedy, though its sequel is only mediocre. Ted Knight is at his best here, soundly better than Robert Stack of the second. Rodney Dangerfield is also hysterically funny here, with every line he says being awesome. Chevy Chase's character Ty Webb is funny, if not as much as the others but still a worthy performance. I'm surprised to see no one mentioned Henry Wilcoxon as the Bishop as a stand out. This is one of his last roles, yet all of his scenes are funny, especially his golf game of epic ""biblical"" proportions. His laugh is priceless and his eyebrows go with his character. Danny Noonan is the only boring element of the movie, but still better than the most exciting characters in other movies. The man who steals the show however is Bill Murray. Every line he says leaves you laughing for hours and his whole performance is amazing. If you enjoy good comedy, make it a point to see Caddyshack.",Caddyshack
172,Bill Slocum,"Good, but no classic",7,12 November 2002,"It's funny how it works out. When the Brits come up with a story about class conflict and the virtues of staying true to oneself, they come up with ""Great Expectations."" Instead, we come up with this.I like ""Caddyshack,"" sometimes quite a bit. But I don't love it, and that puts me in the minority. It's a film that has improved with age, not so much because the years have revealed hidden layers but because its fans tend to amplify every minor joke in it to the point of a cultural touchstone. A writer at ESPN.com, The Sports Guy, has a Mecca-like attraction to the film, and actually excerpted a series of ""Caddyshack"" quotes to help preview the NFL 2002 season. And made it into a two-parter, to boot. I love the Sports Guy; I just wish the film bothered to displaythat same level of ingeniousness.Part of my problem is I'm rooting too much for Ted Knight, even though I know I'm not supposed to. Everyone else acts so reflexively cynical, but Judge Smails has an endearing innocence about him. Just check out that way he laughs. When he holes that putt with Billy Baru, I just want to leap out of my seat and holler, until I realize what happens next. Knight's performance is great because he lets you in.Bill Murray and Rodney Dangerfield are good, and that's all. They have funny lines, and fun characters, but either they or the script kind of leave them in neutral much of the time. Dangerfield's Czervik kind of grates, while Murray's Carl Spackler just makes me think of Brian Wilson after a while, and his failure to interact with anyone else in the case kind of leaves him lost in space.I like Chevy Chase in this movie, more than a little. This and ""Funny Farm"" were the only two films of his I've seen where he bothered to actually play a character, and Ty Webb is an interesting one. Of the privileged class yet endearingly an outsider, Ty seems entangled by his circumstances (the writer didn't pull his name out of a phone book), and wanting something more, something real, something he knows is not his to get: ""Danny, I'm a vegg."" The way he looks at Cindy Morgan's Lacey Underall and says ""Let's pretend for a moment we're two real human beings,"" is almost heartbreaking when you really notice it. On the pure funny side, well, you have his putting (""na-na-na-na"") and his evening drop-by at Carl's bachelor pad. Plus he gets all the best lines (""That's what they said about Son of Sam."")But there's so much dead space in this one, too much gratuitious nonsense. The whole Danny Noonan thing is wasted, and it's only the main plot. His girlfriend's annoying, Brian Doyle-Murray should have stayed behind the typewriter, and the whole slobs-vs-snobs thing feels too tacked on and manipulatively rigged. When the caddies crash the pool, you are supposed to root for them, and want to, but they are just too obnoxious. People who love ""Caddyshack,"" absolutely love it, are the same kind of people who think it's funny to stick their chewing gum in someone else's catheter.Anyone else notice the horn on Al Czervik's boat makes the same sound as the one in his car?",Caddyshack

No comedy, no likeable or relatable characters and no real plot. I've always found Bill Murray a bit hit and miss but I enjoy a good handful of his films but his character was pitiful at best. Chevy was Chevy doing the same thing he always does which is the same in every movie (although I like him in the vacation movies).

Damn, I had read reviews saying this is one of the best comedies of the eighties. So, after watching Caddyshack I only could shake my head and tried to understand how this can be one of the funniest movies ever. I can't make heads or tails of this film, I mean, it feels like it was made of different sketches with no solid or unified script,and full of wasted actors (Bill Murray is like useless) or plain bad acting (Chavy Chase), gratuitous nudity (ok, eighties comedy I know) and a terrible pacing.

184,patricio-53898,An anomaly of a film.,10,11 May 2017,"I've watched this film at least twice a year for a quarter of a century, and the last time I watched it, I realized something: this film is an anomaly. It shouldn't exist as a classic of comedic cinema yet, against all odds, it does. The story is pretty unimportant and there is almost nothing in the way of cogent plot or character development. Furthermore, it objectively fails as pretty much any formulaic type of comedy film. It fails as a romantic comedy, it fails as a coming of age story, and it fails as a class comedy despite its tagline of ""the snobs against the slobs"". However, like a McDonald's cheeseburger, it's greater than the sum of its parts. Taken individually, their ingredients are awful. But when you put them together, I don't know, it just works. I'm of the opinion that the reason that it remains a classic, and that countless golfers across the world chant ""na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na- na-na-na"" as they putt, is squarely on the shoulders of the brilliant performances of the cast. Some of the greatest comedic actors of that era, namely Bill Murray, Rodney Dangerfield, Ted Knight, and Chevy Chase, are firmly on their A Game here, and are absolutely sublime in this film. And with the help of the great Harold Ramis behind the camera, they raise these characters that should've been easily forgotten to some of the most quoted in the history of comedy. It shouldn't have worked, but it did. This film is not for everyone. If you aren't tickled by these performances, then there's very little to hold your interest. And I get that. But that's the way comedy works. It either hits you or it doesn't. And this film still makes me laugh out loud every single time. And I imagine that it probably always will.",Caddyshack

Anyone who would try to do so, is a moron (And most likely a fan of those crap-filled ""Lord of the Ring"" movies). Instead, I'm going to state this single opinion, in the simplest possible terms: ""Caddyshack"" is not the greatest film ever. Heck, it's not even my favorite (""Ferris Bueller's Day Off""). But, when speaking of features in the comedic genre of film, it is without a doubt, an undebatable fact, that ""Caddyshack"", is the funniest of all time! Many women will argue that point (my girlfriend being one of the them), and that's quite all right. Because ""Caddyshack"" isn't designed to appeal to an estrogen-ladened mind.

Forget the billing in this film, Knight is the main character.As for the film itself, it was good but not great. I loved all the characters getting screen time in a movie that seemed to have multiple plots at a time. But that's a good thing. It also has a hidden message of doing what you love to do, rather than doing what's normal or expected.But there were some downers to Caddyshack. I seems like they sped the pace up throughout the movie; most notably the final match and caddy tourny. They montaged their way through it without really diving into them.It's a good sports movie that's better than Bull Durham, but not quite up to the level of Slap Shot.

Almost every scene is a goldmine of quotes, many of which I'll find myself repeating until the day I did. It has a great balance of in-your-face comedy mixed with subtle quick witty humor.
It's not a story-driven film, which is understandably a turn-off for many. But the social commentary is golden.

The actors were at their peak in looks and skill and the lines came off perfectly.If you play golf or have ever been to a private club, you must have had some of these very thoughts that are captured on film.This movie came out 24 years ago and was more than just a flick. It summarized that stage of my life. I was graduating from high school and I didn't realize that EVERYONE had also seen it. Going to college we knew we could always talk about Caddyshack and everyone could contribute.Just re-running a few of the scenes in my head makes me laugh every time. Rodney Dangerfield passed on today at the age of 82. Thanks for the laughs, buddy. You were a big part of the movie and were WELL respected. You will be missed.",Caddyshack
201,Rexfellis,A classic in the genre.,7,8 February 2003,"Caddyshack has some uniquely funny moments.  Carl's (Bill Murray) war with the gopher is hilarious.  The gopher is cheaply made, not even close to taking advantage of the special effects available at the time, but, even that seems to add to his charm.Rodney Dangerfield has one of his best performances in this film.  I don't particularly enjoy his brand of humor, but, he fit in perfectly with the rest of the cast.It is a campy, goofy, sometimes vulgar movie, but that is what was intended. I have fond memories of this movie from when I was younger, and it seems to get better with each viewing.The sequel was made 8 years later.  Unfortunately, it didn't even begin to live up to the standards of the first.  Here are my suggestions for other films you may enjoy from this genre and time frame: Stripes, One Crazy Summer, and Animal House.I highly recommend this movie, as well as the others listed.Parental caution: Nudity, vulgar humor, and sexual references.",Caddyshack

I for one HATE golf and this movie (for me and my family) was non-stop laughter! This movie however does have a couple of scenes where you have a bit of nudity and some sex involved.Caddyshack is more of the adult/young adult comedy. I would advise you not to let children under the age of 13 watch this movie. There is some drug substance in this movie and adults can handle this better than children.In this movie, doing drugs is not that big of a deal. Back in the late 1970's (where this movie was based) doing drugs was not as big of a deal.All in all, this movie was very, very funny for young adults and above.",Caddyshack

But unlike today's dumb comedies, Caddyshack unfortunately has absolutely NO story and it's basically just a series of thrown-together vignettes that, by 1980 standards, were probably pretty funny, but if you compare the movie to today's dumb comedies, they don't measure up.Yes, there are some funny moments, but there's just nothing that holds your interest for very long and there's definitely no storyline that runs from beginning to end. It just feels like they turned on the camera and let Bill Murray, Chevy Chase, Rodney Dangerfield and the others do what they wanted to. Feels very slapdash.",Caddyshack

A have not seen Rodney Dangerfield in a bad movie yet. His style is so unique, even though he might be playing the same character in each film.

There's something there for everyone. Haven't all you golfers out there had some kind of fantasy moments, such as Bill Murray's flower head bashing US Masters winning scenario, I know I have.Watch it if you haven't already, you wouldn't be disappointed.

Bet on the Gopher in a laugh-filled free-for-all,8,13 April 2015,"""Caddyshack"" released in 1980, slammed every golfing style and norm, got away with it, and attacked even more of the pars and norms that constitute a private golfing society. While it seems like only golfers could appreciate the film, there's enough comedy satire and rude put-downs to get a guffaw from any viewer, even if they don't play the game.Danny Noonan, portrayed by Michael O'Keefe, needs a scholarship for college, or he sees himself doomed to working at a lumber yard. He has a job caddying at an exclusive country club, Bushwood, but there's no way that can begin to make a dent in college expenses. He attempts to make an association with Judge Smails, the opinionated, bombastic president of the club, played by Ted Knight, but that goes nowhere quickly. Bushwood appears to be invaded by gophers, the Judge wants them done away with, and the owner of the lumber yard that's causing them to invade the grounds, to also be dealt with. Al Czervik,played to the hilt by Rodney Dangerfield, intends to combat the Judge, and every attempt is made to rudely cast aspirations about the others' character, etc. Bill Murray plays the grounds keeper, Carl, and from there, the laughs continue to mount. Chevy Chase has the role of Ty Webb, the golf wiz at the club, and he performs in his usual, comedic pointed style.One episode leads to another, with the combatants, The Judge, a Dr. Beeper, paired in an on course golf match against Al and Ty. Al injures his elbow, and Danny has to pick up the match, play to win, which cancels out his chances at the Bushwood golf scholarship. To top off this match, Carl is going to attempt to exterminate the gopher, even if it blows the club off the map.It's on to the links, and just sit back and enjoy the laugh filled film.

208,kevino-9,A great all time classic,10,1 December 2005,"Caddyshack is one of the great all time classics of it's time. For any golf enthusiast this is a must see. Also, If you just like plain comedy this is a must see. I have seen this movie over 100 times and I still laugh to this day. Bill Murray plays one of the funniest roles that ever hit the big screen. After you see this movie you start repeating sayings that you hear in the movie. The late Ted Knight and Rodney Dangerfield are hilarious. If you are a Chevy Chase fan you must see him in this role. The role of Ty is the one that opened the door for Chase in such movies as Vacation, Fletch, Spies like us, Three Maiga's and Funny Farm. This movie is one that everyone should have in their DVD collection. You can watch it over and over again and laugh out loud every time. This movie rates on par with Animal House. These two classics will go down as two great movies in their era. For all the young people that have not seen this movie I recommend it highly. This movie is one for the ages.

209,dan-1583,"Training Ground(hog) For What Came Later, But Otherwise An Ill-Paced Disaster",2,16 March 2009,"If you liked Memento, Caddyshack is worth seeing. The same technique of forgetting what you were doing thirty seconds after you begin doing it, and perpetually restarting from scratch seems to be the operating technique here. Except that it applies not to the characters in the film, but to the writer and director, Harold Ramis.Caddyshack is a series of sketches that claim to be a movie, but are really far less than the sum of their parts. There are a few good comedy bits  surprisingly, Chevy Chase is good in an understated way that is cumulatively funnier as time goes by  and Rodney Dangerfield brings the frenetic quality and smart-alecky trademark schtick up front and center that is occasionally pretty good.But the whole film never gets going. Now, I'm not someone who thinks that you have to have a John Sayles plot in a comedy. I'm fine with any amount of utterly improbable nonsense if it moves the comedy along. But that doesn't happen here. Stars are perpetually arriving, doing their little set piece, and then disappearing: so much so that I found myself saying, ""it sure was funnier when ----------- was on screen  say, whatever happened to them anyway?"" about a dozen times. Then, at some point with no relation to anything, they'd appear in a different scene and the process would repeat.Part of the problem is that it's a damned GOLF MOVIE. What the hell? A movie aimed at the Animal House crowd about GOLF??? And the problem there is that there's no template to lampoon. Airplane! is, without a doubt, the funniest film in the last 40 years, mostly because it took the mickey out of all those turgid Airport movies that preceded it, and the whole disaster movie thing. It meant that the jokes could be quick, ceaseless and merciless, and it meant that you kept missing jokes because you were almost crying with laughter from the previous one.In Caddyshack, the whole thing is endless setups for a single lame joke. Ramis does try the parody thing with a little incident in a swimming pool that references Jaws, but it takes five minutes to get through, and the joke has come and gone way before the punchline, which is then totally anticlimactic.Probably the best way and reason to watch Caddyshack, apart from ninja training to learn to overcome suffering silently, is as a perspective on Groundhog Day, which is the SECOND funniest movie in the last 40 years, and for reasons that are entirely due to its own genius. It brings together three elements from Caddyshack: Ramis, again as writer producer; a groundhog; and Bill Murray, who, if you want to see evidence of progress of a great comedian, you need do no more than compare these two films, made 13 years apart.In Caddyshack, Murray is a kind of template for what Jim Carrey started out as: a Jerry Lewis style goof that get laughs from, well, people who think Jerry Lewis is a genius, and gags that depend on what one can only call a ""retard"" persona, which is not funny. All three of these comedians managed to demonstrate at some point in their career that there was some brilliance and control in their comedy, and got way, way better results out of it: Murray in many films, especially Groundhog Day, Lost in Translation, and Broken Flowers; Carrey in Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, Truman Story and a few others; and Lewis in The King of Comedy  in its own way the THIRD funniest movie in the last 40 years. Somehow the effect of each of these was to make everything they'd done earlier all the more intolerable.",Caddyshack
210,LisN2me,Best comedy ever!,9,22 June 1999,"I hate to use the words ""best comedy ever"", because someone always takes offense and says, ""What about ....."". But this film deserves such high praise.  This movie contains the best work of three good comedic actors. Ted Knight plays the perfect bad guy that you'd love to hate.  Rodney Dangerfield is at his sarcastic best.  However, Bill Murray steals the show. I don't believe he has a line that is not ""quotable"".  The scene of his cinderella story was all improvised which makes it that much greater. When you add up the efforts of those three men and then throw in some Chevy Chase, you get an all-time classic.

Caddyshack features an all-star cast of the greatest comedians from the generation that defined comedy films. Rodney Dangerfield was the original prankster and his presence made film extremely enjoyable. Enter veteran actor Ted Knight, who was known for his work as the character Ted Baxter in the Mary Tyler Moore Show. Add Saturday Night Live legends Chevy Chase and Bill Murray to the mix and the result is more than an hour of wise cracks and smart-ass remarks that roll off the tongue in a natural progression.Danny: ""I was hoping to go to college but unfortunately it looks like my parents aren't going to be able to afford to send me"" Judge Smails: ""Well, the world needs ditch diggers too"" The official movie soundtrack to Caddyshack compliments the film nicely. Each song on the CD almost seems to represent a character in the film. It has contributions from various artists who don't necessarily fit in with one another. You have classic rock legends Journey playing ""Any Way You Want It,"" indie punk rock heroes The Paul Collins Beat playing ""There She Goes,"" ""Summertime Blues"" by the late and great rockabilly icon Eddie Cochran, ""Boogie Wonderland"" by r&b legends Earth Wind And Fire, from the early days of MTV ""Something On Your Mind"" by Hilly Michaels, ""Waltz of the Flowers - Nutcracker Ballet"" by Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky, several songs by adult rock singer Kenny Loggins and Bill Murray's own rendition of ""Ballad of the Green Berets!""

230,belknapp-jami,Caddyshack: The genius of Harold Ramis,8,24 September 2013,"The great comedy produced in Caddyshack can be found laughable by anyone, regardless of their golf expertise. The star-studded cast, lead by the likes of Chevy Chase, Bill Murray, Rodney Dangerfield, and Ted Knight, excellently meshes to form the great underdog story of Danny Noonan (Michael O'Keefe). Al Czervik (Rodney Dangerfield) perfectly fits the typical country club hot-shot but oddly enough, is one of the most likable figures due to his generosity and fun-going personality. His nemesis in the film is the cheap and uptight Judge Smails (Ted Knight) who tries to encourage young Danny Noonan to go for the esteemed caddy scholarship. What truly makes the film a classic is the slew of one-line jokes, supported by a tremendous cast, excellent originality, and admirable animations, which are easily able to recite and hilarious in many different settings.Caddyshack can be better thought of as many small movies put together, never really developing a plot but instead, letting the actors' brilliance control the true comedy. In this case, it really worked. Director Harold Ramis uses Bill Murray and Rodney Dangerfield's hilarious antics combined with Chevy Chase's laid-back, lovable nature to keep the dull moments few and far between. The way Ramis gives each individual character their own time to shine makes them all likable and gives the urge to experience more with each and every one. This phenomenal cast leaves you looking for a sequel, or at least to be a part of the typical, and at the same time hysterical, day at Bushwood Country Club.The film's originality draws you into new territory in the comedy world. No other film of its kind previously chartered the waters of pure amusement at a relatively serious setting, Bushwood Country Club. On any given day, one can find the slob groundskeeper Carl Spackler (Bill Murray) using extreme tactics such as dynamite to take down the likes of the ""enemy varmint gopher"" or a slew of Al Czervik's caddies watching television from the side of his enormous golf bag right in the middle of the fairway.Being from 1980 and not having the same technological capabilities of our modern era, the movie excels in the animations department. Some action scenes are even ahead of their time, including the fire shooting through the gophers' hole as it tries to frantically escape the blaze set off by the crazy groundskeeper Carl Spackler. Another includes Al Czervik using a video game like putter to automatically make shots. Both of which produce laughs that will last for days.Ramis' genius script includes the one-liners that can be laughed at in almost any setting. Ty Webb (Chevy Chase) is the master of this; ""don't sell yourself short judge, you're a tremendous slouch"". Lines like this and others such as Al Czervik's ""he called me a baboon, he thinks I'm his wife"" can be funny regardless of context, but when put in action by the characters and their individual interactions, they become hysterical. For what Ramis intended, a movie designed to make people laugh, he greatly excelled in delivering a comedy on a level all of its own.",Caddyshack

The many subplots everyone goes on about are incoherent and go nowhere, the main character is unengaging, supporting characters kind of show up and then disappear or switch personalities, and too many of the gags are recycled jokes.

234,jonathansurovell,Hilarious social commentary,10,6 July 2005,"Just when self-indulgent, intensely clever, but rather meaningless comedy--supplemented by pot and a rather self-indulgent lifestyle--was beginning to loom large in my tastes (Harold and Kumar, The Office, Trailer Park Boys), along comes Caddyshack and to shatter all of that.This just might be my pick for the greatest comedy ever made. It's certainly in the Pantheon, along with such greats as Duck Soup, Annie Hall and, perhaps, Harold and Kumar.Here are the things I love about this film: 1. The allegory for the class system in the US. The setting (a golf course) is ideal for this theme. Unlike in the pathetic flop Happy Gilmore, Caddyshack is as much about the workers who maintain the grounds, and the gulf that separates them from the golfers (who include judges, priests, and businessmen). The caddies are the working class. Some struggle to get out of their predicament, but we're made to understand how hard it is for them. In a brilliant opening dialogue, the caddy hero Danny Noonan says, resignedly, that college costs $8,000/year, that he can't afford it, and that he'll probably end up working in the lumber yard. Chevy Chase's character, for whom Noonan is caddying, responds, ""I own two lumber yards"". ""Yeah, I noticed you don't spend too much time there,"" answers Danny. ""I don't know where they are,"" responds Chase, totally blasé. This is the regard the golfers have for the caddies.Then there's the grounds keeper (Bill Murray) who's recruited by the course owner to kill a gopher (that could spell doom to a golf course--the gopher represents the Vietcong). The grounds keeper is even poorer and less educated than the caddies (like soldiers in the Vietnam war?). There are some excellent scenes of him running through forest looking for the gopher. The scene could virtually be cut out of the film and stuck into Platoon. I liked this technique for spelling out the allegory.But not only do we have workers, soldiers, Vietcong, and the elite all playing the same role on the golf course as in the larger world off the course; there are all kinds of distinctions within each class: Danny Noonan is ostracized by many caddies for trying to suck up to the golfers. Chase and Dangerfield both play eccentric, liberal capitalists who have to contend with conservative Republicans who can't stand to be around ""Jews, Roman Catholics, or Blacks"". Then there's the division of labor between men and women.Most importantly, this isn't in the vein of Les Miserables--it doesn't depict the poor as pathetic and as objects of pity. In Caddyshack, we really see the world from the caddies' perspective. We see how hard it is to relate to the rich (and their Harvard-bound sons), to enter their world.2. The film offers the most idyllic depiction of being 18 I've ever seen. Director Harold Ramis mostly does this through scenes with Danny Noonan and his cute, Scottish girlfriend Maggie and with Noonan facing off against the rival caddy. The scene in which Noonan and his enemy face off in front of the swimming pool offers a stunning depiction of the 18 year-old male body; one of the strongest cases for being gay I've ever seen. He then exploits this beauty to make us dread the oncoming fight: we don't want them to hurt each other for the same reasons we want to preserve the Great Pyramids of Gizah. Ramis exploits this brilliantly by juxtaposing the youthful beauty with intimations that the fight will be brutal and unrestrained.Maggie is ""plain"" as compared to the blonde who walks around the course braless. But the sexual scene with her and Danny is far hotter, than those involving the same blonde. And Maggie comes out of that scene the more attractive of the two. Isn't this the way it goes? We think we're attracted to very conventional beauty, but we inevitably realize it's overrated.3. The musical scenes (the workers' uprising at the pool, Dangerfield driving the yacht) are beautifully choreographed and the music is excellent. In fact, I'd totally listen to the soundtrack.4. A lot of the jokes are hilarious. Chevy Chase's are my favorite and Bill Murray's good too. Don't be fooled, though. On the surface, Murray's monologues and Dangerfield's one-liners are the meat of the film. In fact, they're only the icing on the cake.",Caddyshack

236,Doopliss77,Caddyshack Narrowly Makes Par,7,31 January 2017,"Halfway through my first viewing of Caddyshack—despite how much I was laughing—I wondered aloud, ""What is this movie even about?"" Then I realized that Caddyshack doesn't know either. Director Harold Rammis walked onto the set of this film with a fragile script that was trampled by his star comedians—leaving us with this disjointed but entertaining mess that's become a classic.Caddyshack opens with a hint of a story: Danny Noonan (Michael O'Keefe) is a lanky teen who wants to save up for law school but makes pennies caddying at a fancy golf club. So, Danny tries cozying up to one of the club's wealthy patrons in a bid to win a scholarship. Oh, but before that can move forward, let's talk about the groundskeeper (Bill Murray) who's hellbent on killing a wily gopher! Oh, and the master golfer (Chevy Chase) whose humility hides his talent! And Danny's girlfriend (Sarah Holcomb) who's inexplicably Irish—and the rich bombshell niece (Cindy Morgan) who wedges her slender body into everyone's love lives—and Rodney Dangerfield who basically does a bit in every scene!This all would be enticing if any of it intersected meaningfully, but Caddyshack only ever allows these characters to impact one another's lives at the very end—and even that set-up feels improvised. There are no stakes involved, no dramatic tension (which, believe it or not, is essential even in a comedy). All of these characters crowd the film and eat up its running time, leaving Danny's paper-thin plot as an afterthought. Murray is perhaps the only actor who really gets into his role and grounds it in the film's world, playing a filthy moron that no one particularly enjoys talking to who fumbles his attempts to rid the course of a destructive pest. But it's not Murray's film, nor is it Chase's or Dangerfield's. It belongs to no one.As funny as it was, I was disappointed with the aimless direction of Caddyshack. It's a movie with hilarious moments rather a good comedy. You'll watch, quote, and revisit portions of Caddyshack for the wit and bombast of Dangerfield, Murray, and Chase—but hardly ever for the situations surrounding them.",Caddyshack
237,ngmainwaring,Don't bother,1,16 March 2017,"This is 98 minutes of your life you'll never ever get back. Utterly awful. How people consider this one of the greatest comedies ever completely escapes me. Murray and Chase are bit part roles and Dangerfield is just a parody of himself. With the exception of the gopher, the entire cast is actually the biggest joke and the script and so-called gags are just intergalactically unfunny. My advice to anyone wanting a good laugh at a classy comedy movie is just sit down with a box set of Laurel & Hardy and watch how it should be done and not waste any time with this disaster.",Caddyshack
238,nine_thumbs,Do the 'classics' carry too much gravity to live up to?,5,30 May 2006,"At my age, 24, there are a lot of old 'classic films' that I recognise the name of but, which I have not seen. As a film fan and student I try to make it my job to catch up.And maybe it's me but Caddyshack is, by no means, a classic or even a good film. If you're into modern comedy and thought Ghostbusters was OK (btw, for the record, I love GBs) you might as well just forget you even heard of Caddyshack.The film has no identifiable lead role, discomfortingly swapping stations between dryish Chevy Chase and very dry Bill Murray, who between them hog all the decent lines - few though they are - offencive loudmouth Rodney Dangerfield, stuck up Ted Knight and typical teenager Michael O'Keefe. Who's story is this film telling?It isn't long before the film becomes predictable with Knight stating gambling is illegal and Chase saying he doesn't gamble for money. With Knight's and Dangerfield's conflict the only real substantial one, I found myself simply waiting for the final one round big-money gamble. Murray's appearance, though satisfying, wasn't satisfying enough to justify its need - especially since he did such a bad job of trying to rid the course of it's pest.I've been harsh, I realise. I always try to watch every film with no expectation or premeditated value but when it comes to these 'classics' it's hard not to. There's some witty dialogue and bold performances but the film, overall, is pretty bland.One last thing - going into the 18th all tied with each team taking 3 shots each to pot should have been a draw, right? Or had my mind wandered by then?",Caddyshack
