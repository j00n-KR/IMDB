0,MartinHafer,"""What ARE you watching??!""",7,23 February 2021,"The above summary reflects my daughter's reaction to the first two minutes of ""Dressed to Kill"" as it played on our television. This is because the opening scene features a very hard core scene for a rated-R film...where a woman masturbates in the shower and then fantasizes that she's violently attacked....an odd juxtaposition of sex and violence to begin any film! Yes, with its very graphic nudity and violence, this is probably NOT a film to show your mother, children or Father Peterson if he stops by for a visit!When the actual story begins, you learn that Kate (Angie Dickenson) is a sexually frustrated woman...as she divulges this to her therapist (Michael Caine). Her marriage apparently isn't fulfilling and she longs for a lover. And, in the next scene, she has a kinky quickie with a stranger she's just met in an art museum...and they consummate it in a cab, not in the museum itself....though if they had, doubtless that many patrons would have assumed it was some sort of performance art! He then takes her to his apartment, here they continue the love-making. Oddly, these sequences aren't all that graphic...while the opening scene was tremendously so. I'd also say more about the plot but it's difficult to do this without revealing spoilers. Suffice to say, it is a very violent and bloody film.So is it any good? Yes, though the surprises in the film sure seem a lot less surprising in 2021. Again, I'd like to say more about that...but it would ruin the suspense in the movie. The problem with the film isn't whether or not it's well made or intelligently written...more who would want to see the film in the first place. Yes, it was a popular film in the day, but the violence, seemingly misogynistic plot (according to MANY) and sexual content in the movie are guaranteed to offend many. Well made and scary but not for everyone, that's for sure! If made today, I truly wonder if the film would have been given an NC-17 rating...a rating that wasn't available back in 1980.Originally I was planning on giving it an 8...it's well done. However, the FIRST ending was VERY talky and characters spent too much time talking and talking about what happened in the story....which was selling viewers a bit short. Additionally, the scene in the mental hospital was overdone and even a bit stupid.",Dressed to Kill
1,Leofwine_draca,"A solid, stylish, and powerful thriller",8,4 July 2016,"Brian De Palma here directs another above-average thriller dealing with his principal interests of sex and violence, in his own flamboyant and inimitable style. All of the things you expect from a good De Palma film are here, from the fluid and interesting use of the camera which gives the film a classy visual look, to the elegant music by Pina Donnagio, to the Hitchcock references. Here, it's PSYCHO, with supposed heroine Angie Dickinson, a middle-aged housewife with a problematic sex life, who becomes drawn into a storyline involving a killer.De Palma shows a total understanding of the elements required to make a gripping thriller in this movie and he does everything right. Not least of which is assembling a solid and proficient cast, highlighted by Michael Caine's twitchy turn as a psychiatrist with a dark secret of his own. Fine too, is Dickinson as the bored housewife, around whose sex life much of the film is centred. De Palma enjoys playing with Dickinson's character, twisting her around so that a moment of joy becomes a moment of horror as she learns that a man she has just slept with has a venereal disease. Nancy Allen turns up as the classy prostitute with a heart, who finds herself stalked by the killer in some suspenseful sequences (the best of which is at a train station - something about De Palma and train stations is just right). Smaller parts are taken by Keith Gordon as the young, brainy hero, and Dennis Franz, who adopts the cop-you-love-to-hate type role which he would recreate throughout much of his later career.Highlights in the film for me include an excellent cat-and-mouse game in an art gallery as Dickinson attempts to snag a prospective lover; the aforementioned train sequence in which Allen is chased by both a gang of thugs and the killer; and of course the taut lift sequence. The violence is bloody and brutal without being over the top, and a strong sexual undercurrent runs throughout the movie, occasionally erupting into the aforementioned violence with a lot of power. De Palma can't resist inserting one final shock/dream sequence at the end, either, which rounds things off nicely. Although his repeated camera tricks sometimes work against him (the split-screen, for instance, isn't as effective here as in CARRIE, making the screen muddled instead of exciting), DRESSED TO KILL still stands as a solid, powerful thriller made at the height of De Palma's career.",Dressed to Kill
2,SnoopyStyle,love De Palma's style,8,11 July 2015,"Kate Miller (Angie Dickinson) is a sexually frustrated NYC housewife with science nerd son Peter (Keith Gordon). She goes to psychiatrist Doctor Robert Elliott (Michael Caine). She has an affair with a stranger and then is killed in the elevator by a tall blonde woman with a straight razor. Call girl Liz Blake (Nancy Allen) sees the killer in the elevator and picks up the razor. Detective Marino (Dennis Franz) investigates as she becomes the main witness, a suspect and the next target. Marino gives her 48 hours to find her out of town client who ran away after seeing bloody Kate.I love director Brian De Palma's split screen style. He does it not only with actual split screens but also by splitting the action between background and foreground. There are three amazing high tension thrill scenes. The subway scene, the thunderstorm scene and the final bathroom scene are so memorable. They are all terrific. Dennis Franz is over acting as the hard-talking cop. Also I wasn't as concerned about the transgender serial killer stereotype back in the day when I first saw this movie. I think these are minor missteps that this thriller more than make up for.",Dressed to Kill
3,classicsoncall,"""Don't make me be a bad girl again.""",7,7 November 2021,"There was a reason Angie Dickinson was a favorite of Sinatra's Rat Pack; just check out the opening shower scene that doesn't leave much to the imagination. Elements of Hitchcock's ""Psycho'"" intrude on the plot of this often violent film, with Dickinson's character making an early exit in deference to the story line. Top billed Michael Caine is also a sporadic presence in the picture, though if you count his alter ego, he makes quite a few intrusions into the story with drastic consequences. Dennis Franz shows up in support as the smarmy Detective Marino investigating Kate Miller's (Dickinson) murder, looking in all respects as if he's trying out for a role in 'Hill Street Blues'. Some of the action (or maybe the editing), gets a little clunky when Miller's son Peter (Keith Gordon) gets involved in the case, while Nancy Allen delivers her own steamy presence in a scene where she strips down to her all black under garments. The killer, when revealed, may or may not come as a surprise, depending on how many murder mysteries you might have seen, but for this viewer, it was a neat bit of calculated misdirection by director Brian De Palma.",Dressed to Kill
4,gavin6942,An Erotic Tale of Madness and Murder,7,21 April 2011,"A mysterious, tall, blonde woman, wearing sunglasses murders one of a psychiatrist's patients, and now she's after the prostitute who witnessed it.This film is written and directed by Brian DePalma, clearly inspired by ""Psycho"" and returning to some themes he raised in ""Carrie"". We even have the return of the split-screen shot that worked so well in ""Phantom of the Paradise"" (though less dramatic here).The film opens with Angie Dickinson naked in the shower. Luckily, in the Angie Dickinson shower scene, a body double is used. Her breasts and other woman parts are fully exposed and very graphic, very sexual... it really hurt me to see such an ugly old woman with a beautiful body... and then we again see her (this time for real) topless in a car... oh my! The film as a whole is very sexy, very hot, especially for 1980. It is tantalizing, sensual, erotic, every adjective you can throw at it. The music by Pino Donaggio (a DePalma regular) just brought this to a head. And starring Michael Caine? Perfection.Some other interesting things are brought up that might take a second or third viewing to really appreciate -- the sex change television program, the venereal disease papers in the desk... some of the twists are fairly obvious, but the nuances are something more.Howard Maxford goes so far as to say this is ""arguably"" DePalma's best film... which blows my mind. Is it good? Yes. Great? Probably... but is it as great as ""Scarface""? I do not know... that is quite a leap. But it sure gives ""Carrie"" a run for its money.",Dressed to Kill
5,lee_eisenberg,"all ""dressed"" up and somewhere to go",10,11 September 2006,"In what must be one of the most blood-freezing movies ever, a transvestite is murdering people in New York, and the answer to everything may not be what people suspect. One can see how Brian DePalma takes some influence from Hitchcock with camera angles and stuff. Michael Caine plays a most thought-provoking character, while Angie Dickinson is basically a bored rich woman with a bad hairdo. Keith Gordon (who later starred in ""Christine"") is probably the most interesting character in the movie. But you can't really understand this movie without seeing it. And after seeing it, you may never know just whom you can trust. Also starring Nancy Allen and Dennis Franz.",Dressed to Kill
6,Woodyanders,De Palma in peak sexy and stylish form,9,2 March 2016,"High-class call girl Liz Blake (a winningly sweet'n'sassy portrayal by Nancy Allen) witnesses the savage murder of frustrated adulteress Kate Miller (luminously played by Angie Dickinson) in an elevator by a mysterious blonde woman. Liz joins forces with Kate's whiz kid inventor son Peter (likable Keith Gordon) to figure out the killer's identity.Writer/director Brian De Palma brazenly (and brilliantly) copies both classic Hitchcock and lurid Italian giallos with a giddy audacity that's quite a wickedly entertaining joy to behold: The shocking abrupt dispatching of Kate clearly recalls ""Psycho"" while the vibrant color scheme and aberrant sexuality are more redolent of such Italian maestros as Mario Bava and Dario Argento. Naturally, De Palma pulls off several bravura set pieces with breathtaking aplomb and assurance: An elongated sequence sans dialogue in a museum depicting Kate being picked up by a handsome stranger, the startlingly brutal elevator murder, and a thrilling subway chase are all sterling examples of De Palma at the top of his game. Better yet, De Palma's twisted take on gender issues and sexual identity was certainly ahead of its time, with the subject matter on transsexuals in particular retaining all of its topicality today. Michael Caine does his customary excellent work as reserved psychiatrist Dr. Robert Elliott, Dennis Franz amuses as coarse sleazeball Detective Marino, and William Finley provides the extremely creepy and unsettling voice of the deranged Bobbi. Further graced by Ralf D. Bode's fluid cinematography and a lush score by Pino Donaggio, it's a must-see for both De Palma fans and thriller buffs alike.",Dressed to Kill
7,ccthemovieman-1,"Sleazy, Predictable But Very Entertaining",7,31 October 2005,"A great suspense movie with terrific slow camera-work adding to the dramatics makes this a treat to watch and enjoy. Director-writer Brian de Palma does a super Hitchcock-imitation (many called it a ""ripoff"") with this film and the 2.35:1 widescreen DVD is a must to fully appreciate the camera-work (and several scenes with people hiding on each side which are lost on formatted-for-TV tapes).The downside of the movie, at least to anyone that has some kind of moral standard, is the general sleaziness of all the characters, including the policeman played by a pre-NYPD Dennis Franz (who has hair here!). The opening scene is still shocking with a fairly long shower scene of Angie Dickinson that is quite explicit, even 25 years after its release. The film has several erotic scenes in it as Dickinson (if that is really her on the closeups) and Nancy Allen are not shy about showing their bodies.There is not much dialog in the first 20 minutes and no bad language until Franz enters the picture after the murder. The first 36 minutes are riveting and even though it's apparent who the killer is, it's still very good suspense and fun to watch all the way through, particularly for males ogling the naked women.",Dressed to Kill
8,BA_Harrison,Shower scenes; a gender confused maniac; the supposed star killed off half-way; an entire scene devoted to explaining the murderer's motive: remind you of anything?,8,10 August 2010,"Star of TV's 'Police Woman' Angie Dickinson plays Kate Miller, a bored housewife who is murdered in an elevator shortly after partaking in some extramarital hanky panky with a total stranger. Nancy Allen is Liz Blake, the gorgeous, high-class escort girl (who I have no doubts is worth every penny) who catches a fleeting glimpse of the killer in an elevator mirror before the doors close, and in doing so becomes a target of the maniac herself.With the help of Mrs. Miller's geeky son Peter (Keith Gordon), Liz discovers that the murderer is a patient of the dead woman's psychiatrist Dr. Elliott (Michael Caine) and decides that the only way to uncover the killer's identity is to sneak a look at the doctor's appointment register, a task that might well cost her life.If Dario Argento is the Italian Hitchcock, then Brian De Palma must be the American Argento: Dressed To Kill emulates the themes and plot structure of Hitchcock's seminal classic Psycho, but also utilises the stylised camera-work, clever editing and bloody violence that typifies Dario's brutal giallos. The result is an audacious psycho-sexual horror/thriller that sure takes some swallowing, but which delivers more than enough sleaze, violence and stylish visuals to compensate for any shortcomings in logic.The frequent soft-focus nudity and sex, vicious cut-throat razor attack on poor Kate Miller, and impressive array of directorial tricks employed by the director go a long way to ensure that Dressed To Kill is never boring, but for me, the film's biggest selling point is the very tasty Nancy Allen, who not only strips down to sexy black underwear in an attempt to seduce Dr. Elliott, but also finds time to take a shower in a completely pointless, but very much appreciated final shock dream sequence (ala De Palma's Carrie).",Dressed to Kill
9,moonspinner55,Half-cocked Hitchcock wannabe,4,23 May 2001,"A call-girl witnesses a murder and becomes the killer's next target. Director Brian De Palma is really on a pretentious roll here: his camera swoops around corners in a museum (after lingering a long time over a painting of an ape), divvies up into split screen for arty purposes, practically gives away his plot with a sequence (again in split screen) where two characters are both watching a TV program about transsexuals, and stages his (first) finale during a thunderous rainstorm. ""Dressed To Kill"" is exhausting, primarily because it asks us to swallow so much and gives back nothing substantial. Much of the acting (with the exception of young Keith Gordon) is mediocre and the (second) finale is a rip-off of De Palma's own ""Carrie""--not to mention ""Psycho"". The explanation of the dirty deeds plays like a spoof of Hitchcock, not an homage. Stylish in a steely cold way, the end results are distinctly half-baked. ** from ****",Dressed to Kill
10,dbdumonteil,"prime form, trite contents",7,31 October 2006,"In France, it's considered polite from French critics to genuflect to the apparently cohesive chain of films Brian De Palma left behind him. However, a good proportion of his films are marred by bombastic effects ""Carrie"" (1976), ""the Fury"" (1978) ""Scarface"" (1983) without mentioning his borrowings from Hitchcock. Here, in ""Dressed to Kill"", it's impossible not to think of ""Vertigo"" (1958) for the long sequence in the museum while the key moment in the lift makes inevitably think of the shower anthology sequence in ""Psycho"" (1960). About our involved film, I don't want to revive the old debate: does De Palma rip off Hitchcock? Instead, i would tend to be generous and to classify ""Dressed to Kill"" in the category of De Palma's winners alongside ""Sisters"" (1973) and ""Obssession"" (1976). With however some reservations and they're the ones I previously enumerated which fuel the bickering between De Palma's rabid fans and his detractors.If there's one sure thing in ""Dressed to Kill"" which can generate general agreement among film-lovers, it's De Palma's virtuosity in directing. He wields his camera just like a filmmaker expert is supposed to do. His sophisticated camera work brilliantly fuels the suspense which entails a rise of the tension and a discomforting aura. The audience is easily glued in front of the screen. This is helped by the use of several long silent sequences during which everything depends on looks and gestures. By the way, in ""Psycho"", there were also long silent, suspenseful parts...But the main drawback in De Palma's 1980 vintage is that the quality of the plot can't be found wanting and appears to be a rehash of many formulaic, corny ingredients pertaining to an incalculable number of murder stories. The prostitute is the sole witness of the crime. Then, she's suspected by the police and has to act on her own (with a little help from the victim's son from the scene in the subway onwards)) to track down the murderer and to prove her innocence. Apart from the fact that De Palma uses a type of character who for once isn't demeaned at all, it's a menu which smells the reheated. And the filmmaker ends his film on a sequence that echoes to the opening one. Yes, it's superbly filmed but when one discovers its real function, one figures: ""it's almost gratuitous filler"". Perhaps De Palma wanted to stretch his film beyond one hour and a half when at this time the viewer knows (and even before) who the killer is.The two central mainsprings in De Palma's set of themes articulate hinges on manipulation and voyeurism. The latter theme is well present in ""Dressed to Kill"" from the first scene onwards which makes the film almost look like a soft porn movie. And the filmmaker isn't afraid to film his main actress and wife Nancy Allen in her underwear. I find his approach about this theme rather doubtful. But maybe the first sequence was conceived to be a mirror of the viewer and De Palma wanted to stir his peeping tom side.I don't want to demean at all De Palma's work. His prestigious work in directing which entails a communicative treat to film redeems the global weakness of the story and its doubtful aspects. Twenty six years after, the controversy he aroused amid movie-goers isn't ready to subside.",Dressed to Kill
11,Quinoa1984,vintage De Palma up until the last twenty minutes; slick and tastefully tasteless homage,8,18 September 2007,"Dressed to Kill understandably made a bit of a ruckus when first released in 1980: you had ""Police Girl"" in a role that was mega-erotic, as Angie Dicknson played a sexually frustrated housewife looking for good times in all the wrong museums (and there into apartment elevators), plus Nancy Allen as a call-girl, Michael Caine as Norman Bates's sophisticated New York cousin, and enough lurid imagery to last two movies of the period. Today it's slightly less incriminating by standards and such, though the unrated version has some of the most ""hot"" content of any of De Palma's films, at least in his quasi-auteur period of the 70s and early 80s, where he seemed to repeat themes over and over, ideas taken right off the film-reels of Hitchcock classics and given a tawdry uplift. It's a simple tale that one partly already saw in Sisters, and then again to an extent in Body Double, and also in Blow Out. Cutie Allen plays call-girl Liz Blake, who has to clear her name of suspicion of killing Kate (Dickinson, in full blown 'MILF' mode), after being found with a razor, the murder weapon from Dr. Elliott's office (Michael Caine, stone-cold performance most of the way).From the start, which De Palma seems to do as a way of setting up a dangerous sexual fantasy scene as a way of topping the opening scene of Carrie (which, perhaps, he does just in editing terms), we get a series of technical knock-out turns through the point of view of style itself: the tracking shots in the museum, meant to stir up more of a fascination with the process itself, of following and wanting to be followed, than any kind of tension; the chase through the subway (a precursor to Carlito's Way) is done with a precise level of suspense, meanwhile, with a slightly exploitation bit thrown in with the black gang; the character of Peter, Kate's son (Keith Gordon), who plays what is essentially a younger version of the real life De Palma as a kid (science geek, obsessed with Hitchcock and voyeurism). And it's all entertaining and entrancing as hell as something that comes close to a real synthesis of what makes De Palma's thrillers so unique while being so self-consciously untainted by a fearless attitude of film-making.On the other hand, that same self-consciousness ended up coming back to bite the director in the butt a few times in recent years, and somehow in Dressed to Kill it starts to become very erratic and disappointing as the story has to wrap itself up. As the Psycho themes come together even more apparently (man who wants a sex-change, doesn't even think he's killing as it is *she* who is doing it), there is an expository scene in the police station that makes the aforementioned Hitch film look like an astonishing psychological revelation. And the final scenes at Peter's house, also calling painfully into recollection a much more accomplished sequence in Carrie, are meant for a manipulation that even for De Palma is asking for it; the final shot especially, albeit a master's class in how to copy yourself. Yet there is a very deranged and, within itself, perfect scene at the mental hospital amid this confused denouement, where the doctor does some work on a nurse, to which all the other inmates act like animals in a zoo, and an over-head shot going up and up over the scene is one of the best shots of sexual/general perversion ever captured on film.A shame then that the film ends on such a strange and unsettling manner, where up until then it is a remarkable piece of pulp cinema, where class is all around in the technical aspects (soft lighting, intricate camera movements seemingly so simple) amid subject matter that should be found in the mix of paperbacks for 25 cents. It's no masterpiece, but I'd certainly take it over most of the director's recent thrillers any day.",Dressed to Kill
12,BandSAboutMovies,Like a great remix,9,12 January 2018,"Many find this a hard movie to stomach due to its misogyny. I'll see you that and raise you that it's a misanthropic film that presents all of humanity, male and female, in negative terms. The men in this film are actually treated the way women normally are in films, as either silent sex objects seen (Warren Lockman), sexless enemies (Kate's husband), shrill harpies that need to be defeated (Detective Marino) or sexless best friends who provide the hero with the tools they need to save the day (Peter). Seriously, in another film, one would think Peter would have sexual interest in Liz, but despite her double entendres and come ons, he remains more concerned with schedules and numbers and evidence.",Dressed to Kill
13,Coventry,Get in touch with your homicidal feminine side!,5,10 October 2018,"I have a bizarre love/hate relationship with the films of Brian DePalma, or at least with the ones he made between 1970 and 1985, prior to when he became overly commercial. Some titles, like ""Phantom of the Paradise"" and ""Carrie"", I find uniquely brilliant and they easily rank among my personal favorites of all times. Others, like ""Body Double"" or ""The Fury"", I find dull, pretentious and too desperately aspiring to resemble Alfred Hitchcock. It took me several years to finally watch ""Dressed to Kill"", just because it's De Palma's most blatant attempt to copy typical Hitchcock style and content trademarks, and also because it allegedly is an American version of the Italian giallo (which happens to be a dearly beloved horror sub-genre of mine). Frankly, I don't know what to think of ""Dressed to Kill"". I'm somehow convinced that it would have been long forgotten cult curiosity by now if it weren't for the fact Brian De Palma directed it. This is basically a much sleazier and audacious reworking of Hitchcock's ""Psycho"". Of course, the shocking impact of killing your lead heroine halfway into the film isn't so shocking anymore and the twist-ending also lost its surprise effect, so Brian De Palma (or better, Brian De Pervert) compensates for all this with overlong suspense mounting sequences that lead nowhere and gratuitous shower fantasy and masturbation footage. The cat-and-mouse scenes, for example in the museum or in the subway, are tense and very professionally photographed, but why so long? It feels as if De Palma is openly shouting out to his idol Hitchcock: ""Look at me, Master of Suspense! Look how great I am!"". I can see where the giallo classification is coming from, what with the razorblade as murder weapon and the targeting of lewd women, but personally I won't immediately include it in the genre. The acting performances are terrific overall, with special mentioning of Angie Dickinson in a courageous role and Dennis Franz as the cynical police detective.",Dressed to Kill
14,hitchcockthelegend,Erotico Psycho.,8,13 February 2014,"Dressed to Kill is directed and written by Brian De Palma. It stars Michael Caine, Angie Dickinson, Nancy Allen, Keith Gordon and Dennis Franz. Music is by Pino Donaggio and cinematography by Ralf D. Bode.Brian De Palma continues his commitment to Hitchcock thrillers with this erotic and lurid slice of entertainment pie. Plot in short order finds a razor wielding blonde woman on the loose in the city. A high class prostitute, a psychiatrist and the son of a victim try to solve the mystery before they themselves fall to the blonde killer.De Palma throws it all at the audience here, merrily pushing people's buttons as he goes. He uses all the tools and tricks of his trade for maximum impact, blending a number of genre staples and churning out a hyper stylised neo-noir that gleefully toys with audience expectations. Oh the plot is bonkers, deliriously so, but De Palma is a crafty pro who deftly marries up the excesses of the plot with virtuoso camera work, and not content with that he then brings Donaggio's musical score into play to ensure the viewer's senses are tingling.Unsurprisingly for the director, Dressed to Kill is sexually charged and violent, from the steamy beginning that ruffled feathers in a number of quarters, to the outrageous coda at the end where De Palma homage's himself, it's a film revelling in its schlocky being. However, it still has time for dramatic suspense and dangerously sensual mysticism, reference an extended section of film that sees Allen's hooker pursued relentlessly through the perils of the subway system, and a sequence played out at an art gallery without dialogue as we become Dickinson's disoriented eyes. Then there is the key murder scene, a dizzying array of slashes and cartoonish blood, it's purposely excessive and followed by screw tightening suspense that sets up the rest of the movie.De Palma and his on form principal cast members are having fun, how could they not with such trashy material to work from? Is Dressed to Kill phobic and misogynistic? Well plenty of people think so, in fact there was quite a fall out when the film was first released, when De Palma was subjected to the ire of a few minority groups. Judge for yourself is the only way to go really, but personally in amongst the schlock I feel there's comment on the dangers of fantasising beyond your realm, or of unfaithfulness, maybe even that America is itself irresponsible for its treatment of women on film? Of course it could just be De Palma at his most playful? Sitting there giggling to himself as others lose their cool 8/10",Dressed to Kill
15,Scarecrow-88,Dressed to Kill,9,3 April 2009,"Along with Body Double, De Palma's definitive homage to his greatest influence, Hitchcock, an answer to PSYCHO, brilliantly tongue-in-cheek from the daft title to the answer of who the killer REALLY is, the director is at his very level best, crafting one incredible set piece after another. The contemporary theme of ""gender politics"" is utilized beautifully here and the whole idea of why the killer commits the grisly razor blade murder(..and stalks a second victim, played by Nancy Allen)is quite brilliantly executed. Unfortunately, like Hitchcock's masterpiece PSYCHO, De Palma's ""cat is out of the bag"" and everyone knows the identity of the killer. MAJOR SPOILERS Watching it for the first time in years, I grinned so many times at little sly moves conducted by De Palma in word and visual image, setting up the twist at the end so wickedly. Such as how bored house-wife, Kate Miller(Angie Dickinson)discovers after her sexual encounter with a complete stranger that he has a venereal disease, rushing deliriously in panic from his room. It's a sly move because you are horrified at the fact that she harbors that ""sin disease"", believing this discovery will move throughout the rest of the film, only for her to meet her doom at the hands of a female with blond hair, black coat, and shades, slicing her with a glimmering razor blade. But, the way the tryst itself is executed was a wonder to behold. The way De Palma expresses on the side of the screen images of various items Kate lost along the way, them returning to her mind(..glove in the art museum, panties in the taxi, wedding ring left in her lover's room), how she initiates contact with the potential exchange with the lover without saying a word, how she attempts to slightly fight away her desire for the tryst, and her eventual terror for even instigating the frivolous sexual encounter at all. The way the transsexual killer's identity is discovered is also one hell of a doozy. We watch as Kate's psychiatrist, Doctor Robert Elliot(Michael Caine)listens to a feminine voice from his answering machine, a ""client"" on how she will be seeing another doctor, plans to have a sex change, and admits to borrowing his razor, threatening something criminal. Elliot has this recording, must meet at the police station with a hot-head, very disgruntled police detective, Marino(..De Palma regular, Dennis Franz, perfectly cast), and conceals her identity..why does he do this when it's basically a confession? The exciting ""race against time"" angle, involving prostitute Liz Blake(..the gorgeous Nancy Allen, in a role tailor made for her, who charms in a winning performance, bringing an amazing likability to a provocative character)who is told by Marino, in a very hostile way, that she is the chief suspect because of accidentally grabbing the murder weapon at the scene of the crime(..in the wrong place at the wrong time, she was at the elevator with a male client, who runs away, as the doors open to reveal Kate reaching out for help, the killer hiding). She has 48 hours to save her skin..to find evidence of the mysterious female killer, Kate saw in a mirror(..cleverly established by De Palma), while also being hunted by the psycho herself. There's an amazing set piece where Liz is stalked by the killer to a subway where she also is confronted by a gang of thugs and is painted into a corner when a police officer, a none-too-friendly exchange between these two, exits, leaving her to potentially fall prey to either one or the other. Her blossoming friendship to science wiz, Peter(..Keith Gordon, in a role he's often typecast, a brainy geek with some nifty inventions that come in handy along the way), the son of the slain Kate, is also a marvel of plot convention..together they are able to discover the killer's identity in a thrilling climax as Liz infiltrates Elliot's office, disguising herself as a new client in need of counseling(..her attempted seduction produces a smoldering sexuality Allen easily conveys)to retrieve a patient's name from his appointment book. I recognize that many will always consider De Palma nothing more than a rip off artist with considerable skill, deftly able to use the cinematic toys at his disposal, but films like DRESSED TO KILL are so entertaining in their own right..it's the bravura way De Palma concocts his ideas and unleashes the surprises in such a heavily stylized way, executed with marksman's precision, understanding how to cleverly/cunningly use gimmicks to tell developing stories. Like Hitchcock, De Palma uses visuals to communicate with the viewer, but unlike the master director, is able to incorporate seedier elements and enhance his films with the color/allure of more provocative characters and settings(..such as New York City, and the people who live there). Like this cheeky title, De Palma perhaps used ""BODY DOUBLE"" as a joke regarding his use of such a person in Dickinson's steamy shower scene. Two scenes rather bother me:(1)regarding the protracted explanation of why the killer murdered and the psychological events that brought it about(..obviously a direct homage to the similar sequence at the end of PSYCHO)and (2)the nightmare sequence at the end..I felt neither is really needed, although these are ways to engage the audience, giving them extra when all is over, said, and done.",Dressed to Kill
16,Hey_Sweden,De Palma is in his element here.,8,5 January 2013,"""Dressed to Kill"" is an intense, dreamy, erotically charged thriller, and clearly another of filmmaker Brian De Palma's homages to the works of Alfred Hitchcock. It manages the neat trick of being fairly classy and rather trashy at the same time, as De Palma brings all of his directing skill to bear. This may not be his best but it's certainly one of his most well known, thanks in no small part to the excellent star trio of Michael Caine, Angie Dickinson, and Nancy Allen; Allen, of course, was married to De Palma at the time.Caine plays an eminent psychiatrist, Dr. Robert Elliott, and Dickinson portrays Kate Miller, one of his patients who's not getting any sexual fulfillment in her life. Unfortunately, once she is able to experience an afternoon of passion the satisfaction is short lived, as a tall, cold looking blonde woman in sunglasses and trenchcoat slashes her to death with a straight razor. (This has to rank as one of the scariest ever elevator rides captured on film.) A witness on the scene is high priced call girl Liz Blake (Allen), who's accused of the crime after stupidly picking up the murder weapon. So she ends up working with Kate's son Peter (Keith Gordon) to try to identify the woman, who Liz and Peter guess to be another of Elliott's patients.In the opening minutes of his film De Palma shows you what you're going to be in for, showing Dickinson pleasuring herself in the shower (intercutting shots of Dickinson with those of a body double) until a male stranger materializes behinds her and starts forcing himself on her. The combination of sex and danger is always stressed in this movie; as we will learn our killer has some severe psycho sexual problems. There are some highly memorable sequences, such as an extended seduction taking place inside an art museum, that being followed by a steamy coupling in the back of a cab. Other aspects that make it effective are Jerry Greenberg's editing (this was the man that cut ""The French Connection"", after all), Ralf Bode's widescreen cinematography, and Pino Donaggio's haunting music.The actors each get an impressive showcase; both Dickinson and Allen look amazing to boot. Included in the cast are Dennis Franz as the investigating detective, David Margulies as the psychiatrist who explains everything for us in the end in case we didn't already get it, William Finley who does some uncredited voice work, and Brandon Maggart in a brief bit as a john.Overall, the film has a definite ability to get under one's skin. It's often genuinely spooky and could easily shock more sensitive viewers due to the level of sexual frankness on display. While subtlety may be in short supply, it's hard to deny the ability of ""Dressed to Kill"" to manipulate us into a state of excitement and expectation.Eight out of 10.",Dressed to Kill
17,Doylenf,Effective Brian dePalma thriller with edge of your seat thrills...,7,30 August 2006,"There are so many tributes to Alfred Hitchcock's type of storytelling on display throughout DRESSED TO KILL, that it staggers the imagination--and yet, DePalma has pulled off one of his best directorial efforts. For sheer suspense and a terrifying nightmare of a climax, he has outdone himself.Nowhere is the story predictable. Not even the opening scenes suggest the horror to come--and when things do happen, the fast camera cuts and editing is so well done that you know you're in for one scary ride before the chase for a serial killer is over. And even more creepy is the theme that transexualism is at the heart of the story with the murderer in drag committing the horrendous crimes.There's a nightmare quality to the revelation of the killer, but beyond that I can say nothing without giving the plot away. MICHAEL CAINE as a therapist, ANGIE DICKINSON as his oversexed patient, and NANCY ALLEN as a witness to the elevator murder are all excellent.Without a doubt, one of the most stylish murder mysteries from the '80s and it hasn't aged a bit.",Dressed to Kill
18,preppy-3,Once controversial thriller doesn't age well,6,10 December 2009,"Kate Miller (Angie Dickinson) is brutally slashed to death. The police believe that one of the patients of her psychiatrist Dr. Robert Elliott (Michael Caine) killed her--but have no proof. Call girl Liz Blake (Nancy Allen) saw the killer and the killer knows it--and goes after her. Kate's teenage son Peter (Keith Gordon) tries to help her catch the killer.This was a hot movie when it came out in 1980. There were numerous cuts in a shower sequence and the murder to ensure an R rating and (for its time) it was pretty extreme. Also critics just loved it. I saw it back in 1980 and couldn't figure out why everybody liked it. It does have beautiful cinematography and music and is well-directed...but the plot doesn't make a lot of sense, there are HUGE gaps in logic and the movie is VERY slow. The opening 30 minutes are a real trial. They show Dickinson seeing her doctor, visiting a museum, picking up a man and going home with him. That takes 30 MINUTES!!!! After her murder the movie picks up a little and gets going but the opening really wears you down. Also, seen today, it's hard to believe this was ever controversial. The nudity is still pretty extreme but the killing seems almost tame compared to what we see today--and I saw the unrated version (more nudity and violence). The acting is pretty good (except for Gordon) and there is a very funny sequence in a restaurant at the end when Allen explicitly talks about sex change operations. Still this is pretty slow and pointless. Worth seeing if you're curious but no great shakes.",Dressed to Kill
19,poolandrews,Good killer thriller.,7,4 March 2006,"Dressed to Kill starts off with Kate Miller (Angie Dickinson) having a sexually explicit nightmare, later on that day she visits her psychiatrist Dr. Robert Elliott (Michael Caine) for a session in which she admits to be sexually frustrated & unfulfilled in her current marriage. Kate then visits a museum & picks up a stranger, they go back to his apartment for casual sex, when done Kate is set to leave but is attacked & killed in the buildings elevator by a razor blade wielding blonde woman. Prostitute Liz Blake (Nancy Allen) discovers the gruesome scene & sees the killer but manages to escape. Detective Marino (Dennis Franz) says he suspects Liz as being the killer as there are no other witnesses so Liz teams up with Kate's son Peter (Keith Gordon) to track down the real killer, clear Liz's name & see that justice is done...Written & directed by Brian De Palma I thought Dressed to Kill was a good solid psychological murder mystery. The script is measured & slow at times but it likes to focus on the character's so you really know them, the entire first twenty minutes is just developing Kate as a character before she is suddenly killed off, then the film switches it's attentions to Liz & no one else gets a look in. This way Dressed to Kill is quite absorbing & engaging, unfortunately the character's themselves aren't exactly likable. I found some of the dialogue quite funny at times, especially the dirty talk that Liz spouts occasionally. The killers motives are somewhat plausible but I guess you'd have to be pretty messed up to do anything suggested in Dressed to Kill. It's a good film but it didn't excite me that much & I didn't really find any character to root for or like. The film tacks on a needless & unnecessary twist ending that I didn't really see the point of.Director De Palma directs with style & visual flair, from the art museum sequence to a car chase & as a whole it's impeccably filmed throughout. I'd imagine that every shot in Dressed to Kill had a great deal of thought put into it. I felt the film was a bit flat & uninspired at times though, nothing about it really excited me that much. There is a fair bit of nudity, some sex & rape along with a few bits of gore & violence, Kate's murder by razor blade in the elevator being the highlight, if that's the right word. However, it's by no means as shocking or controversial when viewed today as many would have you believe.With a supposed budget of about $6,500,000 Dressed to Kill has that glossy high production value feel of a Hollywood film. The New York locations are nice, the cinematography is good & as a whole it's extremely well made. I thought the music was inappropriate & was far to loud & intrusive. The acting is OK but despite his top billing I didn't think Caine had that much screen time. Allen was married to director De Palma at the time Dressed to Kill was made, interestingly out of the four films she appeared in made by De Palma in two of them, this & Blow Out (1981), he cast her as a prostitute... A body double was used for Dickinson as she pleasures herself in a shower at the start.Dressed to Kill is a good thriller that is well worth watching but I didn't think it quite lived up to it's lofty reputation. Good but not brilliant.",Dressed to Kill
20,grantss,"Unoriginal, predictable, padded thriller",5,1 May 2015,"Unoriginal, predictable thriller.From the start the movie seems so derivative of several Hitchcock movies. Brian De Palma, who wrote and directed this, tries too hard to be intriguing and suspenseful. Drawing out a scene doesn't necessarily make it suspenseful - it just makes it silly and boring. Then there's the silly tangents which add nothing to the movie.And then the movie also goes on for a few scenes longer than what should have been its ending. De Palma just doesn't know when to stop...Take away the padding in the scenes and the unnecessary scenes and you'd have a fairly short movie.Not Michael Caine's best work. He just seems to be going through the motions here. Then again, he was probably just following the script and direction. Decent performance by Nancy Allen.",Dressed to Kill

It has some brilliantly edited scene's and some scene's that are truly nerve wrecking that will bring you to the edge of your seat. The best scene's from the movie; The museum scene and the elevator murder. There are some mild erotic scene's and the movies pace might not be fast enough for the casual viewer to fully appreciate this movie. So this movie might not be suitable for everybody.The story itself is also quite good but it really is the style that makes the movie work! It might be for the fans only but also casual viewers should appreciate the well build up tension in the movie.There are some nice character portrayed by a good cast. Michael Caine is an interesting casting choice and Angie Dickinson acts just as well as she is good looking (not bad for a 49-year old!).The musical score by Pino Donaggio is also typically De Palma like and suits the movie very well, just like his score for the other De Palma movie, ""Body Double"".Brilliant nerve wrecking thriller.

22,view_and_review,Pitiful,3,26 November 2019,"This was a pitiful movie. They opened up with softcore porn most suitable for late night Cinemax. It got sleazier from there before a slight improvement, then it just went lame.The problems all started when a sex-starved Kate Miller (Angie Dickinson) tried to be fulfilled by a random stranger at an art gallery. In a long, awkwardly artistic, wordless scene she pursued this stranger to his cab where he introduced himself to her by kissing her and removing her panties. It's the kind of hello that a lot of men only dream of being able to give without being arrested. Though this advance was never asked for, it was understood by stranger X because her body said enough. You know, like R. Kelly's song: ""Your Body's Calling For Me.""Oh yeah. R. Kelly is in trouble for misunderstanding body language. Maybe that's a bad example. Let's pretend this man spoke body language better than R. Kelly.After an appetizer in the cab this 50-year-old horny housewife followed the man to his apartment for the main course. She was so lost in sexual bliss she woke up hours later having to rush out to get home to hubby. Because she was so thoroughly pleasured she decided to leave a note for Mr. Warren Lockman (as we find out what his name is) letting him know as much. Then, in the best and funniest part of the movie, she sees a letter from the New York Department of Health notifying Mr. Lockman that he has a venereal disease.Laughing out Loud!Because Kate grew up in an age when the worst thing she had to worry about was getting crabs or getting pregnant, it never occurred to her to have protected sex--especially from a guy she wouldn't even know if she bumped into him again on the street. This 50-year-old vixen was so glad to be galavanting with someone that she threw caution to the wind. She couldn't even remember to pick up her panties when she left the taxi.Even if this woman was a desperate housewife, at 50-years-old wouldn't she have discretion enough to not get humped in a cab? Wouldn't the cabby tell the two to take that nonsense elsewhere (for the sake of his cab)? And the ultimate dingbat move, why would she get banged bareback by a dude she met by him going up her skirt? It was like this was a Tinder hookup without the profile.Well, Kate would never get a chance to learn from her mistake. She got sliced up Sweeney Todd style and left a bloody mess in the elevator. And I really wanted to know if she contracted a VD herself. Darn!The movie never redeemed itself. It was somewhat of a murder mystery floating a Norman Bates vibe except going deeper into the idea of transexualism. We got a couple of more boob shots from Nancy Allen (whom I only knew from Robocop before this) and unfortunately we got to see Michael Caine in drag.This vacuous film failed miserably at suspense and mystery and tried to mask it with nudity. Angie Dickinson is a pretty golden girl, body double aside, but not pretty enough to overlook this fail of a film.",Dressed to Kill
23,evanston_dad,So Bad It's Sensational,9,27 January 2017,"Brian De Palma's wackadoodle tribute to Alfred Hitchcock's ""Psycho"" is like all De Palma movies -- it's actually kind of bad, but it's so confidently bad that it ends up being not only good, but kind of sensational.Angie Dickinson is the Janet Leigh surrogate, and Michael Caine is on hand to play the film's version of Norman Bates. The film builds up to a big plot reveal, but it doesn't do a very good job of keeping the film's secret a secret, which makes me wonder if De Palma and company were even really trying very hard.The film looks terrific and has tremendous style -- a long, erotically charged cat and mouse scene set in an art museum is alone worth the price of admission -- and I'm adding it to the list of films about urban paranoia that were so in vogue from the late 60s into the early 80s and which I'm determined to some day write a book about.Grade: A",Dressed to Kill
24,morrison-dylan-fan,Body Double.,10,24 January 2021,"Since listening to the commentary Alan Jones and Kim Newman did for Dario Argento's The Bird with the Crystal Plumage (1970-also reviewed) I've been aware of the film, but for some reason just never got round to seeing it. Taking part in a best films of 1980 poll,I decided it was finally time to get dressed.View on the film:Inspired by the time his mum urged him to follow his dad and use recording equipment to try and catch him with another woman, the screenplay by writer/directing auteur Brian De Palma slices into the murderous paranoid obsessions which run across his credits, framed in a opening 30 minute set-piece painting frustrated Kate Miller (played with alluring glamour by Angie Dickinson) away from a art gallery to release her desires, that slash Miller into the reflection of deadly obsession.Superbly unleashing a killer twist in the first 30 minutes, De Palma dices a tense Giallo mystery,that builds on themes from Obsession (1976-also reviewed) in wearing a increased blurring between reality and nightmares (a major recurring De Palma motif) in the fragmented state of the clues Liz Blake sights towards finding the killer,whilst Dr Robert Elliott's rolls out psycho-analysis on the possible motive of the psycho, allowing De Palma to wickedly play on perception that shines to the nightmare final.Later writing in his autobiography that he found De Palma a brilliant film maker, but showed very few emotions with the cast and crew, Sir Michael gives a very good performance as Dr Elliott, with Sir Michael having Elliott briskly argue back at cops suspecting that a patient of his might be involved.The first of two times she would play a sex worker in her then-husbands films (the other being Blow Out (1981) ) Nancy Allen gives a excellent turn as Nancy Allen, whose heart of gold stenotype image Allen changes the perception of, with a subtle facial expressiveness undressing Blake's calculations on catching the psycho.Heating up the screen with a opening that marks a return to the shower scene of Carrie (1976) director De Palma & cinematographer Ralf D. Bode dry Miller off with a astonishing, dialogue-free nine minute sequence, where De Palma's distinctive eye for voyeurism eyes Miller with ultra-stylised long first person tracking shots,whip-pans and soft-focus dissolves over the painting of Miller's desires.Backed by a beautiful score from his regular composer Pino Donaggio, De Palma steps out of a elevator murder set-piece, to a sizzling Giallo atmosphere of arc shots, knife-edge tilt shots, slow-motion glimpses of clues, close-ups towards burning dashes of red across the screen, dreamy crane shots, and De Palma's signature split diopter which glide towards the murderer getting dressed to kill.",Dressed to Kill

Title refers to the act of murder and the attire of the killer. He is a transsexual named Bobbie whose mental state crumbles leaving threatening message on his psychiatrist's answering machine. Plot regards three individuals entrapped in a series of events involving transvestism. Michael Caine plays a psychiatrist assisting Angie Dickinson with uncontrolled lust. This leads to a fantastic museum sequence told entirely by music where she connects with a stranger and awakens in his apartment where sexual satisfaction is replaced by guilt. Caine becomes further involved when a patient is murdered using his razor. Nancy Allen plays a prostitute entangled in a murder investigation when she discovers a body in an elevator. Slick filmmaking by Brian De Palma who is quoting from Alfred Hitchcock's Psycho. Dickinson is wonderfully imprisoned by her own lust until she is unable to turn back. Caine is excellent as the threatened psychiatrist whose razor is missing. Allen shows guts and brains as a prostitute on the run. Dennis Franz is commanding as a cop whose best scenes are when he interrogates Allen. Keith Gordon plays the victim's clever son doing his own investigation.

26,kannibalcorpsegrinder,Solid and enjoyable European-style US thriller,7,14 March 2017,"Following a housewife's brutal murder, the only witness to the incident teams up with the woman's son to try to find the culprit which leads them to the patient of a psychiatrist who treated her and tries to stop the killer from striking them in order to cover the crime.This one turned out to be quite the rather enjoyable effort. A lot of the film's great parts come from the manner in which this one deals with the expectations featured here of the film by following so close to its influences. As it follows so close to the main format here, as the general structure employed here comes directly with the structure of having the first half focus solely on the victim to get killed off and then morph over into the investigation into the incidents, that makes for a great deal of fun here as it deals with the few changes to be had with the storyline. That familiarity lends itself a great deal to the overall manner in which this one moves along as that keeps this one a lot more entertaining than it really should be without a whole lot of slashing action throughout here. With a big emphasis on the murder investigation and her involvement in the procedure, there's a nice emphasis here to follow up the later adverts of that ones' followers in a distinctly European manner by introducing not only the main investigation from the police but also going rather nicely into the amateur investigation by way of a piece of evidence only briefly glimpsed during the incident that becomes a central part of the investigation. These elements all give it a rather distinct and pronounced atmosphere to these brands of films which really lets it dwell in that type of sleaze far more comfortably than would be expected, not only from the type of nudity but also the rather stark sex scenes and frequently intoned psychosexual themes from the killer's motivation which is straight out of that particular school of thriller which makes this one connect quite well there. Even with some incredibly well-done stalker scenes, including the opening attack in the elevator, the subway sequence or the finale at the office which give this some rather suspenseful stalking as well to balance it all with plenty to like. These don't help the fact that there's just not a whole lot of slasher action here, as the more thriller aspects here dominate this one so it doesn't have a lot of stalking scenes and the body count itself is so low as to not really offer much in the way of bloodshed or gore. Those looking for a straight-up slasher won't be interested in this one at all.Rated R: Extreme Graphic Language, Full Nudity, Graphic Violence and several intense sex scenes.",Dressed to Kill
27,HotToastyRag,"Fun, but very adult, thriller",7,29 November 2017,"If I were dissatisfied with my marriage and Michael Caine was my therapist, I'd probably have a crush on him. Apparently, Angie Dickinson agrees with me, for in Dressed to Kill, she hits on him during a session. She's married to Keith Gordon, and dislikes many aspects of their marriage, including their bedroom activities. When Michael rebuffs her advances, she looks elsewhere.Dressed to Kill, while completely earning its R rating—it was originally rated X before certain elements were cut—is a very fun thriller. Depending on how comfortable you are in your relationship, this might be a good pick to watch during your steamy movie night. Brian De Palma's script will keep you guessing from start to finish, and you'll be on the edge of your seat once the serial killer makes an appearance and bodies start dropping. It can be pretty scary at times, but if you like this type of movie, it's a really great one. I'm a bit of a lightweight when it comes to scary movies, but I'm also a huge Michael Caine fan, so I ended up liking it.Kiddy Warning: Obviously, you have control over your own children.

The first thing to love about this movie is the camera-work.From the beautiful sequence in the museum, to little subtle things like seeing someone in a door, or reflections in a mirror, the camera-work is some of the best I have seen and really make the movie.The performances are great and if you watch it a second time, there is stuff going on that really gives the game away. Whenever someone flirts with Caine, he looks at himself/Bobbi, and makes his excuses, watcihng this the first time it never really struck me.But the star turn come from Allen, a nice girl by heart, but is one of the biggest lust objects of the early eighties, no wonder the auteur married her.It has dated in thirty years, and some of the lines are laughable, but this still shocking stuff and the inclusion of getting rid of the main character early on is brilliant and daring, just like Hitchcock was.I'm going to watch it again now to spot the De Palma cameo....",Dressed to Kill
30,zetes,"Half good, half moronic",6,28 August 2011,"De Palma ""pays homage"" to Alfred Hitchcock once again with this sometimes entertaining, sometimes completely retarded thriller. It's very heavily influenced by Psycho, with its frequent shower imagery, . Nancy Allen (of RoboCop fame) stars as a hooker who witnesses a murder and is then stalked by the murderer. Allen is quite good here (she was not as good in De Palma's follow-up, Blow Out). Michael Caine plays Dickinson's psychiatrist, who may be hiding information about another murderous patient. Dennis Franz plays one of the worst cops in movie history, very pushy and eager to convict Allen for the murder, and Keith Gordon plays Dickinson's teenage son, a nerdy inventor who teams up with Allen to solve the crime. There are a handful of fantastic set pieces, notably the elevator and the subway sequences (although the latter suffers from some pretty nasty early '80s racism). There's at least one really bad one, too, near the beginning where Dickinson plays a flirtatious game of hide-and-seek in an art museum with a mysterious man (I think his name is MacGuffin).",Dressed to Kill

They have stellar cast including Sir Michael Caine, Keith Gordon, Nancy Allen who was married to director Brian De Palma, Dennis Franz, and of course, Angie Dickinson. The writing could have been better but the acting was stellar. There are enough twists and turns to make you watch this film until it's conclusion. By the end, you want more too. I loved Keith Gordon and had a crush on him since I saw him in Christine. Anyway, the film is overall good not excellent but worth watching during the Halloween season.

Cinematically it is another matter and here De Palma is gloriously updating ideas raised in Hitchcock's original film, even in how he deals with the female lead. Apart then from the possibly dubious set-up and that rather over extended dream sequence (although it made me smile, as intended, I'm sure) this is a fantastically effective thriller more or less in the Italian gialli mould.

The pace of the film is fast and fever pitch from start to finish keeping you the viewer on edge and guessing only to be thrown for a twist and a shock by the end of the picture.Set in New York city in Manhattan the story begins with Kate Miller(the bold and near perfect Angie Dickinson)as a middle age housewife who has problems she's sexually frustrated as her husband can't get it right in bed and her only son is a computer and book nerd named Peter(Keith Gordon)who wants to explore more. So one afternoon before lunch after Kate has a session with her psychiatrist Dr. Elliott(the in top form Michael Caine)she decides to end the afternoon at the city art museum only does she later find out that it will end for good for her! As it's after meeting a mystery type looking guy she follows him to his taxi then to the apartment for a one night stand type of affair, then slowly but surely the film starts to take twist and turns after Kate's life ends some of the characters are connected others are hard to get a read on as no one is who they seem.Now enter Liz Blake(the sexy Nancy Allen)who's a high priced call girl escort type who's at the apartment complex and is a witness to the murder of Kate as she lay in blood on the elevator soon one by one or little by little the pieces start to come together or do they this picture is like a jigsaw puzzle that throws you for a loop.

Plus the movie and film is blended and spiced up nice with plenty of sex and skin and most of it is carried by the sexy performance of Nancy Allen as she rocks it up as call girl Liz as the scene where she strips down to her black bra and panties is some great eye candy! Overall ""Dressed to Kill"" is one fun sexual thrill tease of suspense and twist a maze of complex obsession, deceit and emotional bloody drama of skin and murder as it's really like an identity nightmare for everyone involved.

However, I think it more accurately can be labelled a giallo that happened to be made in the U.S. This film clearly owes more of a debt to Italian movies like The Bird with the Crystal Plumage than to the later American slashers like Halloween. Many of the ingredients of the Italian giallo movie are present in this film - the psycho-sexual undertone, the androgynous black leather clad killer, the fluid camera work, the prominent musical score and the mystery element (whereas in slashers we often are fully aware who the maniac is). If Dario Argento had made a movie in America at this time, it might well have looked a lot like Dressed to Kill.Also, similar to the Italian prototype, the film is not strong on narrative or script; some of the dialogue is very clunky indeed. However, this not a movie that is too concerned about such things. Dressed to Kill is, first and foremost, an exercise in cinematic style. DePalma has often been accused of ripping off Alfred Hitchcock and in this movie more-so than most. While the shower scenes that bookend the film are clearly homages to Psycho, DePalma adopts the approach, first advocated by Mario Bava in Blood and Black Lace, of stripping away as much of the story as possible and, instead, focuses even more on cinematic style and violent imagery.DePalma is a master of potent imagery and there are a number of extremely effective set pieces here. The opening and closing shower scenes are both beautifully shot and very sinister indeed. The gallery sequence is masterfully choreographed and expertly shot. And most striking of all, is the elevator sequence, especially where Nancy Allen appears and is witness to the murder; the use of mirrors, closeups of eyes, the flashing blade and slow-motion photography all combine to produce one of the most unsettling but bravura short sequences imaginable. All of these scenes mentioned are also notable for having absolutely no dialogue in them at all. This just re-emphasises the point that this film is not about the writing but about the look and the atmosphere.Don't check this film out if you like water-tight plotting - there are some obvious plot holes here (there is even a bit of a cheat regarding the killer's identity in one of the split screen sequences). Also, keep away if you require good dialogue. However, if you like movies that are frightening, lurid and beautifully shot then Dressed to Kill is a must. It is where exploitation movies and high artistic visual flair collide in a beautiful and bloody fusion.",Dressed to Kill
39,disdressed12,unrated version,10,29 October 2006,"i just finished watching Dressed to Kill,which is written and directed by Brian De Palma.the DVD had both the""R"" rated version and the unrated version.i chose the unrated version.since i have yet to view the ""R"" rated version,i can't be completely sure of the difference.there is however a very graphic graphic female nudity including a scene of explicit expression of self gratification in this version.i guess you could call this scene soft core porn.if this sort of thing may offend you,i would suggest you view the ""R"" rated version.but i digress.Any comment from here on refers to the unrated version.this is a murder mystery/ psychological horror/suspense movie.there is very little violence and blood.there is however one death sequence of note.the act of the killing itself is fairly graphic.however the blood it self does not look real.it is reminiscent of how a 70's slasher film would look.i believe this is done deliberately to offset the violence of the act itself,to give the scene a low budget feel.most of the violence,or rather possibility of such,is implied.the film is very well paced.as far as i can tell every scene had a purpose,which i find very rare when compared to many of today's films. anyway,i also thought the acting was good,especially Angie Dickinson.and Micheal Cane turns in a quietly understated performance in his role,which works brilliantly in this case.the movie also has one great twist in it,in my mind,although some people might find it predictable.the only complaint(and it's really more of an observation)i have is that i thought the character played by Nancy Allen could have been fleshed out more,especially considering she has a fair amount of screen time.but i think she does a good job with what she is given.and this doesn't really take away from the quality of the film.the film also has a strong moral to it,which is even more relevant today.but the movie doesn't hit you over the head with it.i also really liked the musical score,composed by Pino Dinaggioi felt it was very similar to the music in the original Psycho.to me,this music really elevated the movie.i thought this movie was brilliant.for me,Dressed to Kill(1980)is 10/10",Dressed to Kill
40,OllieSuave-007,A fashionable mystery thriller.,8,19 June 2015,"A classic mystery thriller starring Angie Dickinson as Kate Miller, a sexually frustrated psychological patient who gets into an affair with a man she met at a museum. After their rendezvous, Kate is murdered by a blonde woman, who subsequently goes after high-class call girl Liz Blake (Nancy Allen), who witnesses the crime.It's an alluring mystery that blends in lust, drama and thrills from beginning to end. The first part of the movie with Dickinson is pretty mesmerizing as we learn of her character's psychological and sex life issues. It then leads to the enthralling lengthy museum scene, where she follows a stranger around, hoping for a rendezvous. The plot continues to keep you engaged when Nancy Allen comes on screen as the call girl, teaming up with Kate Miller's son Peter (Keith Gordon) to track down the killer.While the second half of the movie does have some thrilling moments, I thought that it drifted away from the main Kate Miller plot too much. Also, some of the characters weren't emotionally connected to the story, especially when Kate's husband seemed unphased his wife's been murdered and her psychologist (Michael Caine) has not offered a ""I'm sorry about your loss"" to the son. Even worst is the detective investigating the case (Dennis Franz), who acted like an unsympathetic a-hole to all those affected by the tragedy.Overall, though, it's a good, entertaining thriller that, for the most part, is well-paced and intriguing.Grade B",Dressed to Kill
41,bensonmum2,An incredible thrill ride,8,17 January 2005,"What do you get if you mix equal parts Alfred Hitchcock with Dario Argento? Answer: Brian De Palma's Dressed to Kill. I suppose you could categorize Dressed to Kill as an American giallo. This is one of those movies that would be difficult to discuss the plot without ruining a good portion of the movie, so I won't even try. If you really must know more about the plot, read it here: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0080661/I had not seen Dressed to Kill in about 20 years. I had completely forgotten what an effective movie it is. Several particular moments stand out. The first is the art gallery scene. It's basically a long drawn-out game of cat and mouse. Angie Dickinson is at first pursued and later pursues an unknown man. The way De Palma takes the camera around the twists and turns inside the gallery with only the briefest of glimpses of the mystery man is very effective at building tension. It is amazing that he is able to build this tension and then just let it go without the expected payoff.The second scene that I find particularly well done is the famous elevator scene. Unlike the art gallery, there is very little in the way of build up. An elevator door opens and ...well you know what happens. The brutality on display in this scene rivals that of the best Italian giallo. The elevator scene was heavily ""influenced"" by Hitchcock's Psycho. And, the Hitchcock ""influence"" goes beyond the actual murder. It includes the whole idea of killing off your ""star"" within the first third of the movie. It must have taken real guts to tell the studio that now that you've hired Angie Dickinson as the star, you're killing her off before the movie is half over.The third scene that I'll discuss (or not discuss) is the finale in the doctor's office. As I stated at the beginning, I don't want to give away too much of the movie. It is all but impossible to discuss this particular scene without doing just that. I'll just say that it's a joy to watch as De Palma plays tricks on the viewer. Not cheap tricks, but tricks that fit within the story.The only real negatives to the movie are the scenes that take place immediately after the doctor's office finale. The need to explain everything in the finest detail is not necessary. Any viewer with an IQ of the average houseplant already knows what happened. These scenes just feel tacked on and hurt the overall flow of the movie.",Dressed to Kill
42,sol-kay,Slow-Mo,6,9 January 2004,"******SPOILERS****** Extremely long, or did it just seem that way, movie about a woman Kate Miller, Angie Dickinson, who has problems with her marriage and goes to pick up a stranger Warren Lockman ,Ken Baker, at the local museum. Kate after engaging with him in a 100 meter dash for extra curricular activity find out that he's infected with a venereal disease. Later Kate ends up getting slashed to death in the elevator of his apartment building, all this in the first half hour of the movie. The murderer seems to be one of the patients who goes to the same psychiatrist that Kate was going to, Dr. Robert Elliott, Michael Caine. To make the story even more interesting Liz Blake, Nancy Allen, a call-girl opens the elevator door and not only sees the body of the badly slashed Kate but also the murderer who happens to drop the murder weapon, a straight edge razor, right into her hand making it look like she did it! All this is seen in an excruciatingly and endless slow motion sequence. After being grilled by police detective Marino, Dennis Franz, Liz is allowed to go home not realizing that the police are using her as bait to catch the killer. Liz later teams up with the murdered Kate's son Peter, Keith Gordon, to find out who the killer is after Peter saves her from a gang of thugs who chase her through the subway. Liz running into the hands of the murderer Peter sprays with some kind of pepper solution that he invented; he couldn't buy one at the local convenient store? Both Peter and Liz spy on the patients of Dr. Elliott with a hidden camera and find out who the killer is, or so they thought, that leads to the final confrontation at the end of the film. After you find out who the murderer is and what was the reason for killing Kate the movie goes on with what seems to be some kind of dream sequence. Were also given an in depth and x-rated explanation of the killers motives and problems that left us in the audience more confused then it already was. There were some very long sequences in the movie especially in the museum where Kate gets fixated on someone who looks like Leonard Nimoy's Mister Spock from Star Trek. The ending scene with Liz in a shower seems to last as long as the entire movie ""Psycho"" which it obviously was copying from. There's also in the movie a really weird and long scene in a mental ward with a nurse getting strangled to the cheers of the people in the gallery! I couldn't really tell if they were inmates or doctors or medical students? The scene looked like an out-take from the movie ""Glen or Glenda"". Then there was also a chase scene in a taxi that had Liz running into the subway where she was attacked by a gang of thugs! This was so unconvincing that you almost expected the director to yell ""cut"" and say ""let's do it over nobody in their right mind is going to believe this"". I do have to say that the movie was stylish and that Angie Dickinson, for the short time that she was in it, did evoke tremendous sexuality with or without her clothes on but once she was killed off the movie went straight down the tubes.",Dressed to Kill
43,g-bodyl,Strangely Satisfying Thriller!,9,21 June 2014,"I have read about the controversy this film created back in 1980, but it wasn't until now when I viewed the film that I can see why. This is a sharp, twisty thriller that borrows effectively from Alfred Hitchcock trademarks. But upon viewing it, Dressed to Kill is a strangely erotic film that is almost like a soft porn movie. Some of the scenes made me think that I was watching a porn film, but this film will succeed in holding your attention.This film, directed by Brian De Palma, is about a woman named Kate Miller who has a sexually frustrated life and she sees a therapist named Dr. Robert Elliot. But sometime later, she meets this guy at a museum and they have sex. But she finds out he has a sexually transmitted disease and in her haste, she leaves without her wedding ring. But when she reaches the elevator, she is brutally murdered by a razor. From there on out, confusion ensues as people try to track down the killer.The acting is really good. Michael Caine shines very well as Elliot and I wish he had more screen time. Nancy Allen was very effective and had the best overall performance. Angie Dickinson was also really good, but she hardly had any screen time.Overall, Dressed to Kill is a very smart, though erotic thriller that gives off a similar feel to a Hitchcock film. The tension is high and it can also be scary at times. So in other words, it effectively delivers the thrills. I rate this film 9/10.",Dressed to Kill
44,secondtake,"Well made, oddly superficial, with a big twist of course, and great atmospherics",7,6 May 2016,"Dressed to Kill (1980)A nifty little thriller. The opening shower scene with Angie Dickinson showing all to the world was something of a sensation at the time, but I don't know that it makes much sense to the movie. It's all for the starved men in the audience, or maybe for the audaciousness of it, to let you know that this is going to be a stylized, almost fun, thriller.And it is fun! De Palma is a director who knows how to needle the viewer. His fans like being needled, I think (or like knowing that other people are being needled). Examples abound—""Carrie"" and ""Body Double"" come to mind—where the sensational plot is partly an excuse to unleash some good old male voyeurism and sexism. Which is why the movies work so well for a certain audience.And they are well made, certainly, and edited with a clipped economy. ""Dressed to Kill"" has the advantage of Michael Caine in a leading role (though underused, for a two hour film). The rest of the cast is mediocre, frankly, holding up the character types needed for the main conflict.Oh, if you have any feelings for transgender issues, this movie will only reinforce the old stereotype that people with mixed or cross gender issues are sick and need help. Too bad, and shame on you, Mr. De Palma, for perpetuating that kind of thing. 35 years later, I know, but really.Final word—there are many brilliantly made sections of the movie, including a long stretch near the start in the museum that is a kind of hyped up Hitchcock style (""Vertigo""). Indeed, Hitchcock is being made love to all along here —""Psycho"" with this movie's main character's double nature, and even ""Rear Window"" with the peering through windows.

For the most part, the amateurish script and direction make for an embarrassingly bad film.

In many ways it is a remake of Hitchcock's Psycho, yet it is pure New York and it has some kind of a flavor, that of the modern cop-film. The cop is both arrogant and negligent and he runs risks via other people. He goes to a football game or some sports event with his children while someone is running the risk of being killed, and he knows it. So we have the inventiveness of a teenager and the tenacity of a hooker and they both manage to find the killer and even more or less trap him, though they could have been killed in doing so. The final touch though, the punch line of the film is a real twist in the fabric of logical thrilling. And what about having had it wrong all along?

51,jzappa,"Heavy On Influence, But Still Really Distinctive",9,19 September 2006,"Dressed To Kill is one of Brian De Palma's earlier thrillers, one of his heavily flawed but incredibly entertaining suspense films. It, like Body Double, pathologically mimics Hitchcock's classics. Its plot, if not practically a sexier, 1980s-style remake of Psycho, is at least cut from the exact same cloth. The way we're made to think we're watching a completely different kind of movie right up until the big turning point happens, the transsexual element, etc., are all in homage to Psycho.De Palma, even when immersed in Hitchcock's influence, can't help but keep his movie as distinctive as possible from your average suspense thriller. His style is completely his own: His split-screen effects that, instead of being phone conversations, are perfectly timed simultaneous events; his subtle background details that can often times be very creepy; his POV shots; his constant use of mirrors and reflections.Michael Caine, as one would expect from any movie he's in, steals every of his scenes from the rest of the cast, whose performances lean towards the corny side, even spankable Nancy Allen, who I liked a lot in RoboCop, Carrie, and her surprise bit part in Out of Sight.Whatever typical trappings of average 1980s suspense movies this one happens to have, and whatever silliness the plot suffers from whilst tra-la-laing in Hitchcockland, it's easy popcorn entertainment. I would say it's one of those movies that's good to happen upon when flipping through channels if it weren't so edited. The TV version is incredibly lame, butchering the movie to Lifetime or Hallmark status, and the R-rated version detracts from most of the creepy effect of the murder scene.

54,jadavix,"A classic homage and not a ""rip off""",9,19 March 2016,"I read somewhere that Hitchcock was reportedly unhappy with the extent to which De Palma's previous thriller, ""Obsession"" (1976), borrowed from his acknowledged masterpiece ""Vertigo"". If this is true, the master should have saved up his vitriol for the next de Palma work in the genre he made famous - ""Dressed to Kill"", which raises serious questions about the line between homage and rip off, if such a line exists at all.As a big fan of the movie, de Palma's best pure suspense work of all, I believe that its feet are firmly in the homage camp. De Palma had style of his own to spare; his movie doesn't rely on our familiarity with ""Psycho"" to carry itself along: rather it's a treat for fans of the 1960 classic as it wears its influence on its sleeve, but develops into a different beast.""Dressed to Kill"" - and this is not a slight on ""Psycho"" - goes further with some of the themes of the 1960 film. Transexuality was hinted at in Hitchcock's film; here it is actually explored. The killer's sexual motive is also more fully explored. A mere ""rip off"" would not bother trying to juggle these themes: it would give them a nod to make sure we caught them and leave it at that. Rip offs take laziness; proper homage takes dedication and research. We get them both here.It is also true that the movie uses another sublime Hitchcock touch which we also saw in his first thriller, ""Sisters"" - the character presumed to be the protagonist meets a surprising end and the movie abruptly shifts gear as a new, entirely different kind of main character is introduced.There are an infinite number of ways in which a filmmaker or storyteller can substitute one protagonist for another. The master did it particularly effectively, yes, but the technique is too broad in its applications for us to claim it as his own entirely.Lastly, a word about the casting, and its sexual implications. The surprisingly graphic opening scene, with an ageing Angie Dickinson in the shower, shows us perhaps more than we wanted to see. It is a blessing, then, when she is replaced by Nancy Allen's call girl, who has a few scenes that make this one of the sexiest movies ever made.",Dressed to Kill

56,ackstasis,"""Don't make me be a bad girl again""",8,30 January 2010,"Please note that the following review contains spoilers for both 'Dressed to Kill (1980)' and Alfred Hitchcock's 'Psycho (1960).' Brian De Palma has always been one of Hitchcock's greatest disciples, and here he plunders every trick ever used by the Master of Suspense. 'Psycho' is referenced with particularly frequency; for example, this film contains – not one – but two ""shower scenes!"" This borrowing of ideas and visual cues might have seemed superficial, but De Palma really does seem to understand the principles of why Hitchcock's films worked so brilliantly. 'Dressed to Kill' doesn't aim for cheap surprise scares, except perhaps for the moment in the mental institution, but even this is foreshadowed by the scene's smotheringly-dark ambiance.In every suspenseful moment of De Palma's film, the audience is privy to the presence of an attacker, allowing several breathless seconds of foreboding before the inevitable assault. This all harks back to Hitchcock's classic lesson of the bomb hidden beneath a table: for example, when watching 'Psycho,' I've always found that the tensest moment of Janet Leigh's murder is not the attack itself, but the heart- stopping seconds as the audience watches the bathroom door creak open. The entirely-wordless final act of 'Dressed to Kill' is particularly tense, the main character's mortal peril signaled by the image of a single motionless leg. Though De Palma doesn't hold back on the violent imagery, his visual style is incredibly vivid, every blade glinting handsomely in the light.Hitchcock's 'Psycho' explored the correlation between sex (and sexual voyeurism) and violence; Norman Bates committed murder to stem his sexual desires towards women like Marion Crane. Michael Caine's psychiatrist, Doctor Elliot, similarly suffers from issues of gender identity, and his murderous tendencies – executed through his female alter-ego, Bobbi – are directed towards those who arouse his heterosexual male lust. As in Hitchcock's film, the central female character is not virginal, but quite sexually aware (even though De Palma casts a rosy-cheeked Nancy Allen in the role). 'Dressed to Kill' doesn't really explore these issues with any greater complexity than Hitchcock's film, and is occasionally clumsy in its approach: certainly, the confrontingly-gratuitous opening sequence is merely there for titillation.",Dressed to Kill

The elegant music and stylish cinematography blend well with the acting, to amplify a sense of high-class eroticism.But I was expecting suspense; this film had little. The number of murders was minimal. The major incident focused on the victim's brief peril instead of the killer's ongoing malevolent intent. And there were too few suspects. Some of the film's scenes lacked a sense of sinister foreboding.The film's highlight was the art gallery segment, all eight minutes of it. Although it rendered no suspense, it was in itself an elegant display of cinema craftsmanship, an effective blend of silence, fine acting, and technically difficult camera work.""Dressed To Kill"" has the feel of other films from the late 70's, when film makers were exploring how far they could go with sexual content, which makes the film seem dated.Overall, this is a stylish and technically well-made film about eroticism.

61,drownnnsoda,"Superior Thriller, Hitchcock Style.",8,2 July 2006,"""Dressed To Kill"" is centered around a series of murders committed by a transsexual in New York City. Kate (played by Angie Dickinson), a married woman, has a one-night-stand with a mysterious man. After discovering he had contracted an STD, she quickly leaves his apartment. While in the elevator, she realizes she forgot her ring in his apartment. On her way back down, the elevator door opens, and in comes a razor-wielding transvestite, and he hacks the poor woman to death. A call-girl, Liz (played by Nancy Allen) just finished with one of her clients, and witnesses the brutal murder while waiting for her elevator to arrive. As more and more murders occur within the area, the identity of the transsexual killer becomes the main focus of the film.I have to admit, the elevator scene of this movie was pretty intense. DePalma really pulled off the sequence well, it definitely made me uneasy when riding in elevators. The Hitchcockian twist-ending of the film was pretty surprising, and it fit well. The film really reminded me of ""Psycho"" in many ways. The elevator murder was reminiscent of the shower scene that Janet Leigh's character suffered, and the audience sympathizes with her ill-timing and bad luck. The shocker of an ending was quite similar to ""Psycho""'s conclusion, too. The film was well paced and had some clever action scenes. The murderer with the sunglasses and blonde wig was a very creepy costume. The acting was excellent, and there were some genuinely creepy scenes in the film, including the subway scene and especially in the finale between Caine and Allen.Overall, ""Dressed to Kill"" is an excellent horror film, and I enjoyed it. If you like films of this type or are a fan of DePalma, you definitely need to give this one a look, you will more than likely enjoy it. 8/10.",Dressed to Kill

Detective Marino (played by NY cop actor par excellence Dennis Franz) becomes involved when the twisted stalker in heels and blonde wig draws first blood.That's about it for a synopsis, since it's virtually impossible to explain DRESSED TO KILL without risk of spoiling the whole movie. Brian De Palma presents an intensely erotic, sensual thriller. His poetic camera glides across every moment, creating a titillating world of surreal perversity. The musical score by Pino Donaggio perfectly bathes the proceedings in grandeur, adding even more polish to an already luminous picture. De Palma is the first to admit that he admires the film technique of the acclaimed Alfred Hitchcock and that he is unashamed to borrow from one of the best directors of all time. While I personally would never stoop to such a level if I were a major director (""homage"" or no ""homage""), I thank my lucky stars that De Palma went that route for DRESSED TO KILL; it's one of my all-time favorite suspense films, and for me is as fulfilling a movie-going experience as PSYCHO, which it certainly tries to emulate. As much as I admire DRESSED TO KILL, I would refrain from calling it ""perfect"", as the passage of decades has now taken some of its edge off, and Nancy Allen (who was married to director De Palma at the time) was not the most capable actress here. I also think some of the dialogue and police investigations have a tendency to sound unintentionally humorous. ***1/2 out of ****",Dressed to Kill
63,fertilecelluloid,"Surreal, bloody, erotically charged odyssey",8,17 February 2006,"When you compare what Brian De Palma was doing in the 80's to what passes for entertainment today, his films keep looking better and better. ""Dressed To Kill, ""Blow Out"", ""Body Double"", ""Scarface"" and ""Carlito's Way"" are all superb works of a cinematic craftsman at the peak of his powers. The guy had a long run of better than average films. This is pure Hitchcock with an 80's dash of lurid perversion, an affectionately told tale of lust and murder with plenty of twists, huge helpings of style, a stunning Pino Donaggio score, and a trashy, giallo-inspired plot. De Palma's love of complex camera-work and luscious, blood-smudged visuals helps overcome the logical holes while the terrific performances of Dennis Franz, Keith Gordon (a good director in his own right), Nancy Allen (De Palma's wife at the time) and Michael Caine make every scene special.

64,dworldeater,Great murder mystery from Brian De Palma,8,30 May 2019,"Dressed To Kill is one of many great looking and well crafted movies made by director Brian De Palma. The leading ladies of the film, Angie Dickinson and Nancy Allen both look stunning and that alone is worth the price of admission .Their performances however is what is important and the entire cast of this film did a great job in bringing De Palma's story to life. The style owes much to Alfred Hitchcock with much more amped up sex and violence to fit in with more modern audiences. While this may be a very dark and seedy film, it is a classy production with Michael Caine delivering one of his most interesting performances. Keith Gordon gives a strong early showing in this film. I don't want to mention anything about plot, as I don't want to give anything away. Dressed To Kill is a very well crafted suspense story with a lot of eroticism and blood that should please most fans of the genre.",Dressed to Kill
65,Jonny_Numb,"De Palma's ""Psycho""-clone still packs a wallop...",7,14 July 2006,"There was a time where I was of the school of thought (yes, back in an era when I hailed Stanley Kubrick a genius, even though my nagging conscience correctly insisted otherwise) that dismissed Brian De Palma as nothing more than a blatant Hitchcock imitator. Granted, at the time I knew very little of Hitchcock, save for the signature ""Psycho"" and bits of ""Frenzy"" and ""North by Northwest."" Years later, and with a considerably diminished view of Hitchcock (there's really no way around it, folks--you praise him because you want others to think you're an uppity band of glowing intellectuals), I have re-visited De Palma's ""Psycho"" homage, ""Dressed to Kill,"" and am pleased to report it as being as potent and effective as when it was first released.Sure, it's a none-too-subtly-veiled riff on ""Psycho,"" but its construction might be more brilliant and clever. De Palma not only conveys a keen sense of organization in how the plot unravels, but shows a cool calculation in his staging: a dialog-free 'chase' through a museum; a brutal murder in an elevator; and a rain-and-lightning drenched conclusion that is as erotic as it is terrifying. Every move seems charted in advance, and the viewer is just along for the roller-coaster ride.Kate Miller (Angie Dickinson), a middle-aged woman unhappy with her upper-middle class lifestyle (not to mention her husband's weak output), enlists the services of Dr. Elliott (Michael Caine); sexual repression flashes like a big neon sign, to the point where Kate has a tryst that ends on a peculiarly ironic note (tapping into AIDS paranoia before it even surfaced) that quickly takes a turn for the horrific. A lethal blonde in dark sunglasses is stalking the streets, taking aim at promiscuous females with Dr. Elliott's straight razor, and it is up to a call girl (Nancy Allen, from ""Carrie"") and Kate's son, Peter (Keith Gordon--""Christine"") to unmask the killer.Sexual repression, cavalier adultery, prostitution, transvestism, psychosis, and the allure of eroticism that climaxes in violence are issues that pervade to this day, which suggests that ""Dressed to Kill"" was ahead of its time. That its content--from the frankly sexual to the disturbingly violent--still provokes a reaction speaks volumes for its longevity (especially in comparison to how poorly time has treated ""Psycho""'s coy psychoanalysis).While 'erotic thriller' would be a fitting categorization for ""Dressed to Kill,"" it would also cheapen a film that is not luridly exploitative Cinemax fare, but shockingly tasteful and very mainstream. While De Palma wants more reaction for the visceral and less for the emotional is a weak spot (as prurient thrills fade), I cannot fault him for a job well done. Additionally, the film is buffered by strong performances and a menacing score by Pino Donaggio (""Tourist Trap"") to create an atmosphere that is at once moody but also completely manufactured (another weak point).In many ways, ""Dressed to Kill""--with its focus on gender, sexuality, and murder--can be favorably compared to the Italian 'giallos' of the 1970s. Certain set-pieces (the elevator murder in particular) echo Dario Argento's skilled work; some of the graphic prosthetic makeup FX recall Lucio Fulci's ""New York Ripper"" (1982); and even Lamberto Bava (son of Mario) gave his own thinly-veiled homage to ""Dressed to Kill"" with his suspenseful slasher ""A Blade in the Dark"" (also 1982).6.5 out of 10",Dressed to Kill
66,ShootingShark,"Nerve-Wracking, Expertly Directed, Razor Sharp Slasher Thriller",8,28 December 2010,"Kate Miller is a bored suburban housewife who embarks on a risky amour fou and then gets sliced up in an elevator by a psychotic blonde. But the crime is witnessed by Liz, a hooker, who teams up with Kate's son Peter to try to find the killer. It isn't long however before the killer has found them This is the middle film of DePalma's three remakes of Psycho (the other two are Sisters and Raising Cain), and is perhaps the best movie in a fine slasher triptych. It isn't exactly original - as well as Hitchcock it also cribs from Dario Argento, Claude Chabrol and even DePalma's own work (for example, the last shot is identical to the one in Carrie). But as with so many of his films, it's the style that counts and this is a nerve-shreddingly tense, ultra-elegant thriller, with a crafty and devious where-the-hell-is-this-leading storyline to absorb even the most jaded mystery fan. The only requirement of a good suspense movie is to keep us on edge and if ever there was a classic nail-biter this is it - DePalma's NYC is an urban jungle with menace in every corner, every sidewalk, every alley and doorway. We know Kate is gonna get it somehow, and once she does we instantly transfer all our anxiety onto Liz; the movie plays with images of sex and horror and mines that oldest of all clichés - we are always at our most vulnerable when we're undressed. It's an adult film in the true sense, in that it deals with all our sexual fears and neuroses, and its currency is blood and horror. DePalma is the master craftsman here, his camera gliding around the art gallery, the subway tunnels, the lunatic asylum, the steamy bathroom, as we wait for something to leap out of the shadows at us. His tricks of the trade - slow motion, reverse shots, split-screen, slow pans - are employed with stylish finesse. His characters are just as original and intriguing; a libidinous middle-aged Mom, a psychotic psychiatrist, a call-girl who needs all her cunning to get out of a trap, a whizz-kid who uses his smarts to do what the cops can't. What other movie features such an unconventional line-up ? I also love Pino Donaggio's sultry, sleazy score, which seems to have been just dripped over the visuals somehow, alternately soothing and screeching, and in its own way is just as scary as anything we see. This is probably Allen's best role (she was Mrs DePalma at the time) but everybody is good in it. This cast shouldn't fit together - traditional Hollywood glam girl, British impresario, independent art movie kid and no-nonsense method actor - but somehow they do, and their characters are rich and varied, despite largely being cogs in a brutal story arc. One of the best crazy thrillers of the eighties, and a must-see for slasher fans. Trivia - the voice of Bobbi The Killer belongs to cult favourite William Finley, star of many of DePalma's early low budget flicks.",Dressed to Kill
67,rbverhoef,"Has suspense, but not good enough",5,4 May 2004,"'Dressed to Kill' has the elements of a Hitchcock film but never quite gets there. Not in story, not in suspense, although the final sequence of the movie comes very close. Like in 'Psycho' the movie is halfway and what seemed to be the heroine gets killed, and other people try to solve the case. With other people I mean not only the police.The killed woman is Kate Miller (Angie Dickinson), a patient of Dr. Elliott (Michael Caine) who thinks the killer is one of his former patients Bobbi. The murder was witnessed by prostitute Liz (Nancy Allen) and together with Kate's son Peter (Keith Gordon), who saved her from the killer, they try to solve the case. For Detective Marino (Dennis Franz) Liz is the prime suspect.I didn't like the movie very much, but it has some qualities. The movie was nominated for Razzie Awards and a Golden Globe and I think it is exactly that kind of movie. You can think it is great or you can think it is stupid. The acting, to name something, is strange but works in a movie like this. Still, I can understand when you say it is not very good.That the movie is an obvious Hitchcock rip-off also works at times, but when you don't realize that, or don't care, things can look strange as well. I said there are some qualities. One of them is the final sequence I mentioned above. It feels like the makers didn't like the ending and wanted to add one more sequence. Fortunately it is the most suspenseful sequence in the movie, but it was not really necessary. There are other moments with suspense, but not as scary as I thought it could be.The last thing I want to say is that the killer is pretty predictable as well. Although there are a couple of possibilities you will probably guess right. That makes the only reason to see this movie some moments with suspense and may be the score, Pino Donaggio, that is good as well. Director Brian De Palma has made a movie not for everybody, also because of some explicit sex scenes and bloody violence.",Dressed to Kill

De Palma's earlier films are, in my opinion, far more interesting than some of his more famous later works like Scarface or The Untouchables. Dressed To Kill feels to me like a Hitchcock film with a dash of Dario Argento; it's meticulously and artfully directed, but it contains scenes of sudden shocking, bloody violence and, at times, gratuitous sex. It feels like a high-class Gialo film in the best way possible.",Dressed to Kill
69,Samiam3,"Medium good, Psycho rip-off",6,2 May 2010,"If I didn't know better, I'd say Brian de Palma was thinking one of two things when he made Dressed to Kill. Either he had a high opinion of Hitchcock, or a high opinion of himself. I'm drawn to think it is the latter, because Dressed to Kill is a pretty blatant Psycho rip-off. Anything Hitchcock can do I can do better, is what must've been on de Palma's mind, well maybe not better but equally well. The result is a mildly entertaining psychological thriller, sporadically intriguing and suspenseful but with mediocre acting, and a poorly executed climax.Kate Miller (a middle aged New York housewife) has a one night stand with a stranger she meets in an art gallery. As she leaves his apartment, a woman in black leather hacks her to pieces with a razor. The only witness is a local prostitute who has just finished with a client on the same apartment floor. The police make her a suspect, and she is given only a few hours to get the proof that she claim she has. She teams up with Miller's teenage, science geek son to do a little surveillance and spying, on Miller's shrink who may know something about the killer that he has not told yet.It wasn't until the climax when I realized that this film is painfully close to the story line of Psycho. Up till then I was enjoying myself, and despite the feeble characterization, I found myself sympathetic, perhaps even more so than toward Psycho. After all, how can one not have empathy for a boy whose father is a Vietnam casualty and has lost his mother to cold blooded murder, or to a prostitute, who is a perfectly nice human being who just happened to be in the wrong place at the wrong time. Dressed to Kill is resolved with a sloppily written climactic scene, which is a classic example of Deus ex machina. And if that isn't enough the film adds one last sequence for gratuitous suspense, and is clearly a feeble attempt of de Palma to avoid a conventional ending. Dressed to Kill is not much of a movie, but I've seen worse. If you are not a tough critic it may worth a peek if it is on TV at a convenient hour for you.",Dressed to Kill

However, even if I did, I am convinced I wouldn't think that Batman's majordomo was the one. One thing to comment is how hardly my heart started beating in the infirmary hugging scene-- you'll know what I'm talking about. Furthermore, Brian De Palma surely made a GOOD movie with smart development, atmosphere and twist, but we have to admit he was very inspired in 1960's ""Psycho"" and the way Hitchcock used to make his movies.

71,PredragReviews,Classic DePalma stuff,8,2 May 2016,"The 'Pure Cinema' approach deployed here also evokes the best work of Dario Argento, though De Palma clearly has his own agenda. His script attends the fall-out from a terrifying attack on a frustrated housewife (Angie Dickinson) by a razor-wielding maniac who then turns his/her attentions to the sole witness, a streetwise hooker (Nancy Allen) who teams up with Dickinson's teenage son (Keith Gordon) when she becomes a suspect in the case.After a slow first 25 minutes, Dressed to Kill is filled with unbearable suspense for the next 75 minutes. The last 3 minutes of the film are particularly nerve wracking. There are so many great suspense sequences that work throughout the entire film, all the way from the elevator scene to a chase into the subway. Those scenes should give any viewer a good scare. It's certainly what one would describe as edge-of-your seat suspense. I know those sequences freaked me out, and those last few minutes in the film is a true heart-pounding nerve jangler. This is what De Palma is good at and he should make more films like this.Overall rating: 8 out of 10.",Dressed to Kill
72,bkrauser-81-311064,Overt When it Should Have Been More Subtle,6,10 June 2016,"There's no doubt that director Brian De Palma has made an indelible mark on filmmaking as an art-form. His expansive filmography spans six decades and includes some of the most lavish and inspired horror films, the most feverishly opulent crime thrillers and in the case of Scarface (1983) one of the few remakes that is leaps and bounds better than the original. He's become such a legendary figure that esteemed contemporary director Noah Baumbach has released a documentary on De Palma's life's work aptly titled: De Palma (2015). Yet despite some truly inspiring work, De Palma's oeuvre is not without its faults, most of which are very much present in Dressed to Kill.The story concerns itself with the troubles of Doctor Robert Elliott (Caine) who is being stalked by a mysterious killer. Using the good doctor's razor, the killer victimizes the women in Elliott's life including middle-aged patient Kate Miller (Dickinson) and evening escort Liz Blake (Allen). The story is largely told from the perspective of these two women, who along with Detective Marino (Franz) and camera wunderkind Peter (Gordon) attempt to get to the bottom of it all.While in the day, the film was controversial and critically lauded for its dive into sexual proclivities, by today's standards, the film is an exercise in mischievously lechery. The camera leers at the women of the film with an emphasis on eroticism and seems to take delight in objectification. This is despite the fact that we're constantly pulled into either Kate or Liz's head-space. Both seem to approach their sexuality as a means to an ends; one a textbook nymphomaniac while the other works as a high-priced call girl. Yet both are undercut (literally) by the doctor, the detective, the killer; basically every important male character in the film. It's a weird game of sexual politics that is meant to evoke and heighten the suspense but only succeeds in making the audience feel unclean.Of course, that may be the point of the film. By forcing the audience to explore the dimensions of their own voyeurism, presumably they feel the shock and impact of Dressed to Kill final reveal. Such a technique has been used successfully by Hitchcock, David Lynch, David Fincher and even by De Palma himself in films like Obsession (1976) and Body Double (1984). Yet if you can't divorce yourself from modern mores, you may find yourself bewildered by the the film's more exploitative elements that go beyond titillation. The fact that the film exists primarily for the sake of shock value certainly takes away from some admittedly artful suspense building.The other element plaguing Dressed to Kill is its unbearably 80's aesthetic. Dressed to Kill is stuck somewhere between the loud palette of Scarface and the empty consumerist sleekness of Valley Girl (1983); and that's despite the fact that the grimy streets of crime-ridden New York City are front and center. Every time the city injects the frame with any kind of personality (which NYC does in nearly every film), Brian De Palma fights it with an attention- grabbing camera technique that emphasizes story details with the force of a bullhorn. I'm sure, just like the sexuality, De Palma's techniques were revolutionary but by today's standards, their distracting at best.While certainly not a terrible film, Dressed to Kill is weighted down by distracting visual elements, uncomfortably outdated notions of sexuality and a story that doesn't provide enough juice among its pulp. What's meant to be subtle is overt and what's overt should have been more subtle.",Dressed to Kill

The scene in the museum is beautiful, I admit it, the one in the elevator beautiful and nasty at the same time - that's all good. But then there's loads of dialogues and incidents that didn't work so well, such as Caine and Dennis Franz at the police station (though nicely intercut with Gordon's bugging), a so so acting Nancy Allen en the subway scene that is much troubled by a total lack of logic, or, better said, a multitude of coincidences; the cop versus the gang, Gordon's appearance, who is subsequently blinded by mace, but a few seconds later he just walks away and escapes...There is more to be criticized and praised, but I'll leave it at this.

75,Maciste_Brother,"Mildly amusing ""giallo"" with gargantuan plot-holes",4,1 April 2003,"spoilersWhat can you say about a movie when the best thing about it is Angie Dickinson? Or that the movie starts and ends with dream sequences of a woman taking a shower and getting killed? This is another De Palma cheesefest, filled with sexism, split-screens, Pino Donaggio music and ""deviant"" behavior like transvestites/transsexuality. DRESSED TO KILL is filled with SO many contrived moments that it almost becomes deliriously funny. Here are a couple of examples:After Angie has sex with the man at his apartment, she finds out that he has some sort of venereal disease. Shock! But the thing is, when was this doctor's report made? 6 months ago? 12 months ago? In other words, the film makes a big point to show something like this and yet forgoes all other aspects about this ""shocking"" revelation that divorces it from reality. The man might have already been cured for all we know. Making a big fuss over things that might be explained a bit more rationally only makes DTK look silly and overwrought. Yes, I know that it's all about Angie's feelings of guilt but the way it's handled in DTK still makes me laugh for all the wrong reasons.And when Angie is in the elevator and realizes she left her wedding ring at the man's apartment she goes back to the seventh floor only to face the killer there who subsequently slashes her to death. First, how did the killer know that Angie would return to the seventh floor? Second, how did the killer anticipate that Angie would be alone in the elevator? Third, if the killer bothers to murder Angie in the elevator, why doesn't the killer stop the elevator on the seventh floor or in between floors? This would have prevented the elevator from going up or down to other floors where people are waiting patiently and who would be witnesses to the murder. Massive and inexcusable plot-holes.There are numerous other silly details, like the kid playing Hardy Boys and creating a camera that takes time-lapsed still shots of the doctor's office, or the whole pointless split-screen moment, when we see, on the left side of the screen, Michael Caine listening to disturbing messages and watching documentaries on transsexuals, and on the right, we see Nancy Allen being chased by, gasp, a tall blonde woman. Those scenes are only there to pad the movie's length. They are pointless. And to make things even more deliriously silly, De Palma shamelessly channels Hitchcock, which gives another layer of unintentional weirdness/awfulness to it all.Even with all it's flashy camera-work and violence, DRESSED TO KILL is surprisingly low key. At times, it looks and feels like a low budget film. There are just a couple of set pieces. And there are only a couple of characters. The film feels small. And like every Brian De Palma films (his big or low budget ones), there is one great scene that stands out, this one being the entire museum scene, but then everything else falls apart fast soon afterwards. DRESSED TO KILL peaks very early and there's simply nothing interesting that happens after the elevator scene. Michael Caine, straight from two disaster epics (THE SWARM and BEYOND THE POSEIDON ADVENTURE, both bombed massively), sleepwalks through his role. Nancy Allen is sexy in a sassy and street-smart way but I felt at times that she didn't care much for the whole thing. That she was above this kind of film. And the guy who played the kid was okay but I never liked his role. He doesn't seem to belong in this type of film. In the end, Angie's character is the only one in the movie who seemed to have a semblance of depth. It's not much but seems to be much when compared to the cardboard characters populating the film. It's one of Angie's best performances. And as for the dream sequences, they're totally gratuitous. One was enough. I don't see the reason for book-ending the film with two similar dream sequences. They're contrived and just a tad tasteless, to say the least, certainly the one with Angie's body double. The second dream sequence reinforces the fact that De Palma didn't have a good script and didn't know where or how to end the movie. I mean, there are three endings in DTK.In closing, I have to admit that the first time I saw DTK, I HATED it! I still do BUT now having been a fan of the giallo genre for many years, which DRESSED TO KILL was obviously inspired by it, I can now finally put DTK in some sort of context (other than a cheap Hitchcock rip-off) and see it for what it is (or for what it tried to be): it's a definite mixture of gialli and Hitchcock films. As mildly amusing as DTK is, I can't help but wonder if De Palma and Dario Argento weren't competing with each other back in the 1970s and early 1980s, continuously trying to top each other with these giallos, or gory thrillers. Of the two filmmakers, I prefer Dario films made before PHENOMENA. TENEBRE seems to be Dario's answer to DTK and as uneven as TENEBRE is, it is more rewarding than DRESSED TO KILL. At least TENEBRE has a real transsexual. LOL!",Dressed to Kill
76,BrandtSponseller,"Worth viewing, but it hasn't aged well",7,21 February 2005,"Kate Miller (Angie Dickinson) is having problems in her marriage and otherwise--enough to see a psychologist. When her promiscuity gets her into trouble, it also involves a bystander, Liz Blake (Nancy Allen), who becomes wrapped up in an investigation to discover the identity of a psycho killer.Dressed to Kill is somewhat important historically. It is one of the earlier examples of a contemporary style of thriller that as of this writing has extensions all the way through Hide and Seek (2005). It's odd then that director Brian De Palma was basically trying to crib Hitchcock. For example, De Palma literally lifts parts of Vertigo (1958) for Dressed to Kill's infamous museum scene. Dressed to Kill's shower scenes, as well as its villain and method of death have similarities to Psycho (1960). De Palma also employs a prominent score with recurrent motifs in the style of Hitchcock's favorite composer Bernard Herrmann. The similarities do not end there.But De Palma, whether by accident or skill, manages to make an oblique turn from, or perhaps transcend, his influence, with Dressed to Kill having an attitude, structure and flow that has been influential. Maybe partially because of this influence, Dressed to Kill is also deeply flawed when viewed at this point in time. Countless subsequent directors have taken their Hitchcock-like De Palma and honed it, improving nearly every element, so that watched now, after 25 years' worth of influenced thrillers, much of Dressed to Kill seems agonizingly paced, structurally clunky and plot-wise inept.One aspect of the film that unfortunately hasn't been improved is Dressed to Kill's sex and nudity scenes. Both Dickinson and Allen treat us to full frontal nudity (Allen's being from a very skewed angle), and De Palma has lingering shots of Dickinson's breasts, strongly implicit masturbation, and more visceral sex scenes than are usually found in contemporary films. Quite a few scenes approach soft-core porn. I'm no fan of prudishness--quite the opposite. Our culture's puritanical, monogamistic, sheltered attitude towards sex and nudity is disturbing to me. So from my perspective, it's lamentable that Dressed to Kill's emphasis on flesh and its pleasures is one of the few aspects in which others have not strongly followed suit or trumped the film. Perhaps it has been desired, but they have not been allowed to follow suit because of cultural controls from conservative stuffed shirts.De Palma's direction of cinematography and the staging of some scenes are also good enough that it is difficult to do something in the same style better than De Palma does it. He has an odd, characteristic approach to close-ups, and he's fond of shots from interesting angles, such as overhead views and James Whale-like tracking across distant cutaways in the sets. Of course later directors have been flashier, but it's difficult to say that they've been better. Viewed for film-making prowess, at least, the museum scene is remarkable in its ability to build very subtle tension over a dropped glove and a glance or two while following Kate through the intricately nested cubes of the Metropolitan Museum of Art.On the other hand, from a point of view caring about the story, and especially if one is expecting to watch a thriller, everything through the museum scene and slightly beyond might seem too slow and silly. Because of its removal from the main genre of the film and its primary concern with directorial panache (as well as cultural facts external to the film), the opening seems like a not very well integrated attempt to titillate and be risqué. Once the first murder occurs, things improve, but because of the film's eventual influence, much of the improvement now seems a bit clichéd and occasionally hokey.The performances are mostly good, although Michael Caine is underused, and Dickinson has to exit sooner than we'd like (but the exit is necessary and very effective). Dressed to Kill is at least likely to hold your interest until the end, but because of facts not contained in the picture itself, hasn't exactly aged well. At this point it is perhaps best to watch the film primarily as a historical relic and as an example--but not the best, even for that era--of some of De Palma's directorial flair.",Dressed to Kill
77,seymourblack-1,A Brian de Palma Tour de Force,9,20 August 2010,"""Dressed To Kill"" is a visually impressive psychological thriller which contains moments of suspense, humour and violence and also numerous twists and bizarre developments. Its story is delivered in a way which is extremely elegant, fluid and well paced and also features enough unexpected elements to keep even the most demanding viewer fully engaged throughout.Director Brian de Palma is generally recognised as a disciple of Alfred Hitchcock and this movie is clearly influenced by ""Psycho"". There are numerous direct similarities including the style of the murder, the type of weapon used and Angie Dickinson's role fulfilling the same function as Janet Leigh's. It's also interesting, however, that the Hitchcock influences don't stop there. The choice of the back of a taxi as the location for a steamy encounter involving Angie Dickinson's character and a stranger is undoubtedly inspired by one of Hitchcock's widely quoted anecdotes which related to his preference for leading ladies who might initially appear to be cool or remote. The amount of audience manipulation used is also a characteristic of Hitchcock's work.Brian de Palma is so technically adept that his work on this movie ensures that it never becomes mere pastiche. An extended segment of the story which is told without dialogue is immensely impressive and the split screen sequences are also very effective.Kate Miller (Angie Dickinson) is a frustrated middle aged housewife who discusses her problems with her psychiatrist, Dr Robert Elliott (Michael Caine) and in the course of their conversation comes on to him. He resists and later she goes on to have a fling with a complete stranger before being brutally murdered. The only witness to the crime is a high class call girl called Liz Blake (Nancy Allen) whose story isn't believed by the police and she becomes their main suspect and also the killer's next target. She then sets off to find the real murderer and joins forces with Kate's teenage son Peter (Keith Gordon) who is an inventor with a precocious talent which he puts to good use in trying to ascertain the identity of the killer.The quality of the acting is consistently high with Angie Dickinson being particularly good at conveying her feelings during the sequence which had no dialogue and Nancy Allen being equally successful at portraying her character's streetwise attitude and vulnerability. Dennis Franz is also amusing in his support role as the crude and insensitive Detective Marino.The exceptionally beautiful score by Pino Donaggio is haunting and absolutely perfect for this particular movie.",Dressed to Kill
78,aciessi,Dressed to Impress,9,22 August 2020,"Brian De Palma and murder mystery go together like bread and butter. Dresses to Kill is an exquisite thriller. Visually, it's as sexy as cinema can get. The cinematography is spellbinding. De Palma can split-screen and close-up like no one else in the business. In particular, the scene in the museum is masterfully shot. When he makes a thriller, he knows that showing is much more effective than telling. Definitely reminiscent of Hitchcock.",Dressed to Kill
79,DarthBill,I wonder if Angie Dickinson's panties are still on the floor of that taxi...,6,14 September 2005,"Wouldn't you know it - just when a sexually frustrated wife (Angie Dickinson) finally gets some good, passionate, satisfying sexual rapture, she finds out the guy had an STD - and then she gets mutilated by a tall, creepy gal in an elevator. From there, it's up to the only witness, call girl Nancy Allen, and the victim's son Keith Gordon to find the culprit. And where does Michael Caine fit in to all of this? It may be an unpleasant ""Psycho"" rip off, but it has its moments of inspired, atmospheric audience manipulation - plus Nany Allen looks great in black lingerie or no lingerie at all. The final nightmare however is too long. Film probably would have benefited from keeping Angie Dickinson alive to be stalked relentlessly.DVD includes theatrical and unrated cuts of the film plus interviews with the cast and Keith Gordon going on and on about what a great metaphor it is leading up to Angie Dickinson's doom as she loses all her ""protective layers"" - gloves, wedding ring, panties, etc.Speaking of the panties, the scene of Angie having her panties pulled off and left on the taxi cab floor before getting a finger penetration is probably the otherwise gruesome film's only real comic highlight.",Dressed to Kill
80,TOMASBBloodhound,"""I borrowed your razor...""",8,7 May 2003,"Spoilers!!!!This Brian De Palma thriller was one of the first ""grown up"" movies I watched as a child. It scared the heck out of me then, and it still packs a punch today. Both the scary parts and the eroticism (which I didn't understand back then) are very compelling.The story centers around the brutal murder of a housewife by the female personality of her shrink. It seems Dr. Elliott (Caine) is having some type of serious identity crisis. He wishes to become a woman (operation and all) but his male side is still aroused by attractive women. Whenever he becomes aroused by a woman, his feminine side named Bobbi attacks the woman with a straight razor. This is truly an original story. I really wish I would have thought it up first.The movie is beautifully filmed and well acted. The film's atmosphere is it's driving force. Logic kind of takes a back seat to it all. There are plenty of erotic moments, and the musical score will be in your head for quite some time after the movie is over.The only major drawback to this film is the lack of mystery about who Bobbi really is. There are plenty of dead giveaways that she is really Caine in drag. The whole story would have been better served if this would have been kept a secret until the very end. That said, this film still has plenty of suspense to keep your blood pumping.Speaking of keeping your blood pumping, how about the women in this one? We all knew Angie Dickinson was a classic beauty, but who would have thought Nancy Allen looked that good with her clothes off? I suppose De Palma knew since they were married at the time!4 1/2 of 5 starsSo sayeth the Hound.",Dressed to Kill
81,gab-14712,Hitchock-Light!,8,29 October 2017,"What do you get when you combine Alfred Hitchcock and a thriller suspense story from the 1980's? Well, you would get 1980's thriller Dressed to Kill. From the beginning, you can tell that director Brian De Palma was trying to emulate Alfred Hitchcock's films of old. Many young filmmakers at the time tried to make films with a Hitchcock influence, but many of them failed. However, Dressed to Kill mostly succeeded in creating a ""Hitchcock"" film. According to famed critic Roger Ebert, ""He (De Palma) places his emphasis on the same things that obsessed Hitchcock: precise camera movements, meticulously selected visual movements, characters seen as types rather than personalities, and violence as a sudden interruption of the most mundane situations."" While the movie may not be peak Hitchcock, we get have an entertaining thriller that is violent, engaging, and surprisingly effective.My first thought of the movie was that it is a strangely erotic movie. In all honesty, it is really a softcore porn movie, at least that is what it felt like to me. It is a movie that pushes sex up to the top and then some. It does star some respectable Hollywood actors and a well-loved director, so at least the names give the movie legitimacy. Let me tell you why I believed this film was a porno at first. Just listen to the plot. There is this middle-aged woman named Kate Miller (Angie Dickinson) who is frustrated with her sexual life. She goes to a therapist named Dr. Robert Elliot (Michael Caine) to help her through her crisis. After a session with the therapist, she randomly meets this guy at a museum and they have sex. After she finds out he has a STD, she leaves hastily. The problem is that she forgets her wedding ring. As she goes back to retrieve her ring, she is brutally murdered with a razor. Now there are all sorts of problems as everyone tries to track down the killer.I thought the performances were solid ones. The big name here is Michael Caine. He does wonderful in all his films, and there is no difference here. His character is very charismatic, but there is a hint of darkness hidden behind the charisma, and that interested me because I am used to Michael Caine playing a beloved, helpful good guy. Angie Dickinson gave a solid performance as the sexually-deprived housewife. I am still on the fence about Nancy Allen's performance. She played a high-class prostitute named Liz Blake and was named the only suspect for the murder. Her performance went over-the-top at times, a little more than I was comfortable with. It's funny because she was nominated both for a Golden Globe and a Razzie for her performance.One important thing to note about the movie is that it is not pushed forward narratively. De Palma and writer George Litto made this film more of a stylistic one. Also, certain themes we look at today were looked at differently thirty-seven years ago. The movie has a strange way in using transsexuality and schizophrenia to build the case for the homicidal maniac seen killing people in the movie. There are plot issues at hand, but plot is not the strongest suit of the film. It is all about the shocker value that is effectively delivered.Dressed to Kill is an interesting movie to say the least. It's an erotic thriller that follows the footsteps of earlier Hitchcock movies. But one thing to note is that it is not a Hitchcock film, but De Palma comes very close in recreating one. The film is suspenseful, thrilling, and there are what seems to be an indefinite amount of twists and turns. If anything, you get to see Michael Caine deliver a performance outside of his wheelhouse.My Grade: B",Dressed to Kill
82,HabibieHakim123,Psycho And Carrie In One,10,16 November 2021,"Dressed To Kill is like watching Psycho (which is inspired the movie) and Carrie (one of De Palma's previous film) at the same time, from the music, cinematography, tense, and of course the story is exactly like Psycho with more freedom of nudity and violence, and the most impressive thing on the movie is that when everytime they build the tense with no dialogue, just a music score in the background, following the person for a pretty long time and it's just really moving you, you're into it, and then oddly it's still get you, it's a terrifying movie with a fantastic performance by all the cast, Dressed To Kill is a hell of a movie and it's definitely one of, if not De Palma's best.",Dressed to Kill
83,grahamsj3,Decent thriller,7,30 January 2004,"SPOILER!!!! I've never quite understood why Angie Dickenson's name appears so prominently as a star in this film. She gets herself murdered pretty early in the film and thus isn't really a factor in the film. This is a pretty good one though, a thriller about finding her murderer before he/she strikes again at the lone witness. Michael Caine also stars along with a young Dennis Franz. Altogether and enjoyable film that should keep your interest all the way through to the end.",Dressed to Kill
84,vostf,De Palma's problem with his Father,7,14 June 2001,"It's always interesting for a movie enthusiast to look about for references. The Hitchcockian references in Dressed to kill are so numerous that it tends to be a psychotherapy for little de Palma to show he is as strong as his father.Most de Palma's movies are full of such long-drawn-out references. Sisters and Obsession for instance are based on Psycho and Vertigo. Dressed to kill uses both to a wide extent. But neither did it avoids technical or visual clichés of the 70s.(SPOILERS TO COME) The main idea for de Palma was to recycle the starting point of Psycho which is to get rid of the main character before the middle of the movie. Angie Dickinson's death is not so shocking as Janet Leigh's. Her wandering is just about sexual affection and even before she gets gored she is threatened by a possible venereal disease infection. This is much too heavy. Of course there is a shower scene at the beginning. Erotic the way 70 movies thought would be artistic (hazy-ach so). The museum scene is a nice homage to Vertigo (I dare use that word because there is much of a reference) but it turns into something breaking the visual pace. Something leading to unsafe raw sex. With the menace of the stranger tailing her.De Palma appears to be less self-assured once he achieves part.1: the Hell with my main character. There is no such mystery as after you get flabbergasted under the shower in Psycho. The investigation revolves around Michael Caine's character. As with Norman Bates. He dresses like a woman. But he is quite original with his razor (reminds me the lift-shower scene is also a reference to the glasses reflecting the murder in Strangers on a train. Then the razor becomes a suspense key as was Robert Walker's lighter).The final part is also made of references to Vertigo and Psycho. I shall add Rear Window since the peeping nerd is closer to the impotent Jimmy Steward sending Grace Kelly for a crime evidence. Anyway what Nancy Allen does inside Caine's flat is close to Kim Novak's ambiguous character in Vertigo. Then let's finish as we started: with Psycho. Caine's arrest is similar to Norman Bates' but above all, after a lovers'meal without Cary Grant and Ingrid Bergman, we go to asylum. Here we find the murderer more terrifying than ever with his interiorized insanity. Those last images are great and I have to acknowledge de Palma knows how to finish (Sisters'last images already made that good impression upon me). (END OF SPOILING SESSION)Nevertheless this is a patchwork. Having seen previously the major Hitchcock movies I am surely very tough on that movie but I do not think it deserves leniency for there is little creativity in it. Not bad, sure but de Palma's directing is heavy with his industrious references. Go and see the original Hitchcock movies. I'll refund you twice the difference.",Dressed to Kill
85,acidburn-10,The best Hitchcock impression,8,17 November 2011,"The plot = A lonely housewife Kate Miller (Angie Dickinson) has a day like any other day she visits her doctor (Michael Caine) and then attends a museum, there she meets a man and begins a torrid sexual encounter with him, meanwhile she's being followed by a mysterious tall woman in shades and a long black coat.Released in 1980 and directed by Brian De Palma, was very much controversial due to it's violence and nudity. But in my opinion ""Dressed To Kill"" is one of the finest of thriller/slasher movies of it's time with fine performances from each of the main cast and its ability to keep me interested all the way through, beginning with the first shocking murder scene right through to the shock ending, which really surprised me when I first watched it, I mean wow I did not see that one coming.Okay this movie has obviously borrowed inspirations from Alfred Hitchcock movies, but it's copied with true style, like making you think that Angie Dickinson is the main focus of the movie up until her death and then the main focus switches to Nancy Allen the eye witness and new target of the killer. I also enjoyed the remainder of the plot and the artistic directing and a cat and mouse between the killer and Liz, who is assisted by Peter Miller, the son of Kate, who is awkward, virginal and not remotely macho. DePalma throws in a genuinely tense chase on a subway train which is all great viewing. There are also several scenes which echoes ""Psycho"", but that doesn't make this movie in any way bad.The acting Michael Caine although slightly underused was excellent especially towards the end when his true colours are shown. Nancy Allen has the ability to combine sensuality and intelligence in a manner which I find incredibly alluring. Keith Gordan also does well playing the geeky son and Angie Dickinson really shines in her short screen time showing vulnerability and making you feel for her when she gets it.All in all Dressed To Kill is easily the best film that De Palma has ever made along with such greats as (Sisters, Obsession & Blow Out) and is as effective back then as it is today.",Dressed to Kill

87,melvelvit-1,A Hollywood giallo Argento would be proud of!,10,29 May 2011,"DRESSED TO KILL, despite a rather ""superficial"" reputation, turns out to be considerably more complex than it's generally given credit for and it's obvious Brian De Palma enjoyed expressing an unabashed admiration for Alfred Hitchcock and, apparently, Dario Argento. If ""The Master Of Suspense"" had made a giallo, it would be very similar to this delirious fever dream and the movie owes as much to the Italian horror movie sub-genre as it does to PSYCHO. The trope they share (the vivid colors, the sex, the gender confusion, the set piece slaying, the evocative score, the quirky characters, the ""shocking"" off-the-wall solution to the crime) make the connection unmistakable and a few particulars bring it home. For instance, Angie Dickinson's white-on-white look (cotton-candy bubble blonde hair, white clingy dress with matching coat, gloves, and shoes) can be found in Mario Bava's BAY OF BLOOD and a savage straight-razor murder in the elevator of a high-rise apartment building by a monster in sunglasses, floppy hat, trenchcoat, and leather gloves also takes place in Argento's THE BIRD WITH THE CRYSTAL PLUMAGE. De Palma's stylish (a trait often associated with good gialli) 'psycho'-sexual thriller opens with an erotic dream and ends in a nightmare of similar ilk -and in-between nothing's what it seems. Duality abounds:The respectability of an upper-class house-wife's life hides a cat in heat while ""the oldest profession"" is just a front for a naked capitalist but the kind, caring Kate and the hooker with a heart of gold, good women both, are up against a twisted inversion of their outward selves: a psychiatrist (a fiendish Michael Caine) who's a man on the outside and a woman on the inside, a professional in a position of power who's supposed to help -not hurt- his patients. Then there's Kate's son- in the beginning he's a computer geek, a nerd, but at the end of the day he's the fearless hero, solving his mom's murder and saving the hooker while the cop who appears to be an appallingly wrong-headed boor is actually anything but, knowing a lot more than he let on. De Palma's oneiric opus compares favorably to PSYCHO in at least one respect -it has a character the audience comes to care a lot about in a very short period of time. Like Janet Leigh's Marion Crane, Angie Dickinson's Kate dominates the first half hour and their pursuit of happiness opens a Pandora's Box that causes a sexual psychopath to run amok. Kate's affluent life-style is riddled with loneliness and lack of fulfillment and a ""mid-life crisis"" sets the chain reaction of murder and madness in motion. The seductive ""pick-up"" sequence in NYC's Museum of Modern Art is one of the most pantingly ""romantic"" prowling sequences, ever. With a near-swelling musical score replacing the spoken word, Kate's emotions are conveyed on her face and in her expressive brown eyes: hesitancy, hope, fragile bravado, and finally wistful resignation. The sexual satisfaction, when it finally happens, is immediately followed by sobering shock, guilt, and regret that spiral out of control and with a final agonized scream, Kate's life ends in one of the most vicious sex murders ever seen in a mainstream thriller (similar to Marion Crane's in PSYCHO). The superb Angie Dickinson has only a brief half-line of dialogue (as she's pulled into the cab) during the final twenty minutes she's on screen except for one orgasmic cry of ecstasy that rises to blend with mid-town Manhattan's blaring traffic and her name is only spoken once (during the investigation) -she's referred to mostly as 'Mom' by her teen-age son. Having seen hope and sadness in her eyes and insecurity and vulnerability flicker across her face -and later, sheer terror- it's easy to feel as heart-broken as her son was sitting outside the detective's office when she's murdered. There's many who think Brian De Palma's masterful multiple homage is merely a derivative doppelganger but who cares? It's an unforgettable Hollywood Giallo and I give it a 10/10!",Dressed to Kill
88,Nightman85,De Palma delivers another masterful thriller!,10,27 March 2006,"Intelligent, stylish, and compelling thriller from the great Brian De Palma is a modern classic that firmly ranks among his best films!When troubled housewife is brutally murdered by a bizarre stranger, the victim's son joins with a prostitute to uncover the killer.Dressed to Kill left a strong impression upon the audiences of its day and for good reason. De Palma creates a wonderfully dramatic story that begins with an intriguing setup and builds into a harrowing mystery full of strong suspense. The finale and conclusion are especially 'nightmarish'.It's a truly edge of your seat shocker. Even more impressive though is De Palma's elegant direction that gives this film not only tight suspense but a unique and dark atmosphere of its own. Dressed to Kill is also a very erotic film, but mainly in a strangely beautiful way. Pino Donaggio also lends a lovely musical score to the film.The cast is another strong feature of this film. Michael Cain does a terrific turn as a psychiatrist. Angie Dickenson is wonderful as the ill-fated housewife. Nancy Allen's performance as an involved street-walker is solid. A young Keith Gordon also proves to be a worthy supporter as the investigating son.Many criticize De Palma's films for having Hitchcockian elements and this film was no exception. But any similarities between Hitchcocks works and De Palmas can only be seen as a good quality, as calling this film a 'rip-off' would be degrading to a fine thriller.

But this movie threw me completely off guard because I had no idea what zhanra it was up until the murder of Kate Miller. Till then I thought the movie was going to be an erotic love thriller(this especially due to the silly music that was playing the whole time). Nonetheless this move isn't bad, but it damn sure isn't anything special. A very average De Palma flick that for some reason was nominated for a bunch of Razzies. But don't let that fool you, it isn't near as bad. The acting is pretty solid and there are also some bright moments from the cinematographer.

91,majikstl,Designer knockoff...,3,8 March 2005,"It is difficult to know just how to judge Brian DePalma's films. He is undeniably talented, and is capable of creating masterful works of kitschy dark humor like CARRIE and THE PHANTOM OF THE PARADISE, elegantly stylized suspense thrillers like OBSESSION and slick colorful popcorn epics like THE FURY and THE UNTOUCHABLES. Yet, much of his filmography is dominated by cheesy trash, marked by sloppy plotting, self-consciously showy set pieces and sometimes embarrassingly awkward drama. Often, too often, he focuses his attention on one or two sequences on which he can sate his penchant for flamboyant camera stunts and the rest of the film is slapped together with narratives and scenes that are as rickety as a rope suspension bridge from an old jungle movie.His tendency to plagiarize, er, uh ... pay homage to Alfred Hitchcock is well known, but he is not all that discriminating in his thefts. He steals the set up for DRESSED TO KILL from Hitchcock's PSYCHO, imitates a bit of VERTIGO and even shoplifts from FAMILY PLOT, but the bulk of the film has no great respect for the master's work. It is like stealing the crown jewels to use the gems as trinkets on a dime store charm bracelet. The bits and pieces of Hitchcock that DePalma flashes on screen are meant to be nothing more than little trophies.Like PSYCHO, the film is a two-part story; part one being a personal drama about a woman in emotional turmoil and the second half a thriller. But one of the reasons DRESSED TO KILL doesn't work is that DePalma doesn't seem to get what makes PSYCHO great and he totally fumbles act one. In PSYCHO, Hitchcock carefully structured the Janet Leigh story to be a compelling, self contained drama, separate, yet firmly connected to the Anthony Perkins thriller that followed. DRESSED TO KILL gives us this long and ultimately pointless shaggy dog act one involving Angie Dickinson as Kate Miller, a desperate housewife looking for some hot sex in the afternoon. DePalma has never shown any intrinsic gifts for comedy, yet he repeatedly goes for ill-considered humor to no real effect. When Kate serves up a smirky sexual innuendo to her teenage son, you can't help but cringe. Her discovery that she might have been exposed to a venereal disease seems aimed at getting a tasteless laugh, Even her lurid masochistic sex dream comes with a punchline.The film treats Kate like a pathetic joke and introduces her to one humiliation after another, before disposing of her and her story entirely. Unlike Leigh's Marion Crane, Dickinson's Kate Miller is pitiable, but not very sympathetic. Despite a nice performance by Dickinson, her character is nothing more than a trivial plot device. Yet, this disposable beginning is the best thing about DRESSED TO KILL. Though it is treated with all the subtlety of second-rate soft-core porn, this part of the film at least provides some guilty pleasure sleaziness to it. When the film gets to its slasher movie core, DePalma clumsily stitches together a lame series of sequences involving a cross-dressing killer, improbable coincidences and a vaguely homophobic plot littered with treacherously illogical holes and punctuated with embarrassingly bad dialogue. And the less said the better about the almost comatose performance by Michael Caine as a compromised psychiatrist and the creepy work of Dennis Franz in what would be the first of many stereotyping roles as a vulgar, unpleasant police detective.When the film came out in 1980, it was greeted with mixed reviews, though a good number of top critics embraced it on purely stylistic grounds. And on one viewing, without much time for thought, the film moves along nicely if improbably from one contrived moment to the next. But great, or even good thrillers should be able to endure repeated viewings; knowing all a film's secrets should not lessen the enjoyment of watching it more than once. Indeed, the more a film like PSYCHO reveals about itself the more there is for the viewer to enjoy. But the striptease that DRESSED TO KILL does over repeated viewings only prompts the viewer to see that the pseudo-sophisticated style DePalma drapes over his tale is only meant to hide an already lifeless mannequin.",Dressed to Kill
92,avik-basu1889,"Little substance, but very impressive style !!!",7,28 July 2016,"'Dressed to Kill' for me is one of the prime examples of a film which doesn't really make you think a lot, but has numerous individual scenes which leave you in awe because of the masterful filmmaking on show. Anyone who has seen a few films from the past will be able to figure out that the spirit of Alfred Hitchcock looms large over pretty much every minute of this film apart from some other influences like Dario Argento and other Italian suspense filmmakers of the 70s.Let me first point out the aspects of the film that I loved:1. Angie Dickinson and Michael Caine are very good. Dickinson is supposed to portray a sexually frustrated wife who can't help but crave constant sexual fantasies. She does it very well. Her acting has a lot to do with her facial gestures and expressions because a lot of her scenes have very few words. Caine on the other hand is fascinating as the psychiatrist who always remains mysterious. He is a character that one can't really figure out and Caine brings the complexity out brilliantly.2. De Palma shows here why he is a masterful technician. He uses all his film school knowledge and influences to the core. We see long extended takes, a number of tracking shots, the juxtaposition of saturated colours in the rest of the film with the darkness in some crucial scenes, the use of split diopter shots and split screens,etc. Anyone who loves the craft of filmmaking will find the film a very exciting watch due to the various techniques being used. 3. The soundtrack for the film composed by Pino Donaggio is great. The main theme is beautiful.4. The famous Art Museum scene has to be given a special mention although it is just a further representation of De Palma's masterful filmmaking. It takes a brilliant director to have the capacity to execute a wordless scene like this. A whole plethora of emotions and numerous changes in mood are conveyed just through the camera work, editing and Angie Dickinson's facial acting. 5. Lastly, I'll say that 'Dressed to Kill' still offers a fun, engaging film watching experience to anyone. It is well directed and the 104 minutes run time just flows by.Let's come to what didn't work for me:1. I have already mentioned that this film is heavily influenced by Hitchcock's work. It is impossible to not get constantly reminded of 'Psycho' and to some extent of 'Vertigo', but that's also the problem here. The ideas that were present in Hitchcock's films were well explored by him that made the films thematically deep. 'Dressed to Kill' however in a way comes across as a film that wants to be Hitchcock-esque, but fails in exploring its ideas as well as Hitchcock did. The film really isn't about anything. There are certain ideas present in the film, but De Palma doesn't really seem interested in exploring them. The overt similarities with Hitchcock's scenes to some extent bring out the shortcomings in De Palma's ability to add layers and depth to the story.2. Nancy Allen, Keith Gordon and Dennis Franz didn't really impress me with their performances. I unfortunately found their performances to be a little artificial.3. The film for the most part remains sensual and sexy in a tasteful way. However there are two scenes in particular in the film which unfortunately looked a bit distasteful and sort of exploitative and this is something that also bugged me while watching 'Carrie'.So overall I found the film engaging and well made. One has to acknowledge De Palma's filmmaking prowess. However there are some glaring flaws in the film too which prevent it from making the transition from good to great. The style is brilliant, but the substance, not so much.",Dressed to Kill
93,jackasstrange,Brian DePalma... That is FOR REAL?!,4,12 November 2013,"This film is basically about DePalma being a fan of Hitchcock. He truly wanted to make a homage to Hitchcock's works, specifically Psycho, but if you've seen this film, you do know that it obviously don't work so well as it was expected(if anything was expected). The very bad and cartoon- ish acting by almost all the actors, added to a weird inspiration of erotic films of the 70s and a laughable travesty Michael Caine, gives to this film an almost spoof air,and instead of being a homage, it turns to be a satire of the Hitchcock's works. Funny, though. And seriously, this film cant be taken serious.All the situations depicted on there are pathetic, the characters motivations are obscure, and they aren't even explained in the film. The initial shots of the film are arguably the most pointless that i've ever saw too. And i just don't understand what was the reason in putting erotic scenes in the film. That was just pointless, just so bad it's good. A good parody. 4.5/10",Dressed to Kill
94,mnpollio,Classy Hitchcockian homage,8,1 June 2007,"Intriguing psycho-sexual thriller allows director Brian DePalma to combine all of his obsessions (sex, Hitchcock, violence) into one nifty package making this his most fully realized film outside of The Untouchables. Film opens with a sexual fever dream from frustrated suburban housewife Angie Dickinson, who jumps at a chance encounter with a stranger in an effort to escape her stifling marriage and ends up causing all hell to break loose. Without ruining anything, there is a shocking murder and various characters find themselves inadvertently thrown into the mix, including sexy high-class prostitute Nancy Allen, aloof psychiatrist Michael Caine and geeky computer expert Keith Gordon. In truth, the identity of the killer is easy enough to figure and the storyline is relatively conventional. However, DePalma's magnifies the suspense with various Hitchcock-ian devices and cinematic tricks. He once again utilizes the dream imagery done so well at the climax of Carrie and split screens to showcase the actions of two separate characters at the same time. Pino Donaggio's hypnotic score adds to the atmosphere and DePalma's set-up in the museum between Dickinson and her future paramour is superbly choreographed. Highlights include the elevator attack and the train chase. Caine is relatively underused here, but Dickinson makes a strong impression as the bored housewife, Allen makes a lively and resourceful damsel in distress and Gordon is a winning foil. Also interesting to see Dennis Franz as a loud-mouthed NYC cop years prior to his break-out role on NYPD Blue. A bloody, suspenseful, and classy treat, where one actually does not feel cheated by DePalma's trademark manipulations.",Dressed to Kill

98,Thrashman88,Dressed to bore,5,20 May 2012,"I remember watching ""Dressed To Kill"" in my early teens and thinking it was kind of neat, but a bit slow. Fast forward almost 30 years and I find myself buying this title on Bluray and watching it with my wife for some kinky fun. Although it starts out interesting, ""Dressed To Kill"" has little plot to develop after the first 30 minutes. It is obvious that Dr. Elliott (Michael Caine) is the mad psycho in the movie. Anyone who knows how to count to ten can figure that out very early in the movie. Released during the slasher era craze of the early 1980's, ""Dressed To Kill"" bummed those looking for the cheap thrills and explicit violence of ""Friday The 13th"" and ""Maniac"". Brian DePalma's movie tries hard to please everyone: from suspense to slasher fans, without accomplishing much for both. Pino Donaggio's score is top notch and the atmosphere of bleakness DePalma creates are the saving graces of this film. Even in the end, DePalma tries to pull the same trick he pulled in ""Carrie"", by setting up cheap scares based on a nightmare the heroine of this movie (Miss Blake, played by a very gorgeous Nancy Allen)has. It's true that compared to films done today, ""Dressed To Kill"" plods thru like a mastodon caught in a swamp, but it's also true that many movies from that era still hold remarkably well and even have better directorial and story qualities. ""Dressed To Kill"" unfortunately tries to drag a 15 minute story way too long. Too little suspense, too little gore and only some decent skin-showing. Make sure you drink a lot of coffee if you plan to watch this or else you might fall asleep!",Dressed to Kill
99,ryan-10075,Great kinky Hitchcockian Thriller,8,8 July 2020,"I have always enjoyed this film, but before rewatching it last night to review it I think about 10 years had passed since I seen it last. It does not take very long to realize that writer/director Brian De Palma's favourite director was Alfred Hitchcock. Taking monster inspirations from PSYCHO to VERTIGO. I think when watching the film before that may have prevented me from looking at the film as something better than just an alright movie.We follow Kate Miller (Angie Dickinson) who is having some wild, lurid sexual fantasies. She really in the end just wants to cheat on her hubby. She talks to her shrink Dr. Robert Elliott (Michael Caine) about this. The main plot point though is there is a person dressed in black who is killing beautiful women. After her murder her son Peter (Keith Gordon) begins investigating to try and find the real killer. Also starring Nancy Allen as call-girl Liz Blake and Dennis Franz as Det. Marino who is investigating the murder.Wonderfully shot by Ralf Bode and Pino Donaggio's music at times is extremely effective. I enjoyed how the killer is not just creating corpses and another person is dead every 10 minutes. It is much more than just a standard slasher. De Palma does a great job here although he does have the amazing Hitchcock to thank for some of it. Recommended to those who love Hitchcockian flicks.",Dressed to Kill
100,brefane,Much ado about nothing!,3,15 March 2010,"Influenced by the films of Dario Argento, DePalma's exercise in glossy trash reworks several of Hitchcock's plots. The film begins promisingly with Angie Dickinson as the film's only sympathetic character, but after Dickinson is sliced to ribbons in an elevator, the film becomes talky and devoid of genuine wit or suspense. And despite its reputation, the film isn't sexy or scary. The humor is crude and dumb, and for suspense is created by an overused score and actions prolonged beyond endurance. Uncommitted performances from Nancy Allen, Keith Gordon, Dennis Franz and a gross Michael Caine fail to create genuine concern or interest and the ludicrous, patched-together plot isn't really interesting. Besides Dickinson, who is warm and appealing, Mary Davenport from DePalma's Home Movies and Sisters has a funny reaction as the ""woman in the restaurant"", and the madhouse sequence at the end is effective, but Dressed to Kill offers few rewards. Sisters(73), a reworking of both Rear Window and Psycho, is DePalm a's best horror film and Hitchock homage.",Dressed to Kill

But it was all to obvious as to who the killer was that kept turning the good doctor on to sexual desires.  The razer in the doctors home was missing and we had no clue in the movie as to an intruder and as I've said the mysterious killer looked to much to be a man, clean shaven and you could tell that it was the doctor.

That makes me laugh; but, I'll bet that it also helped to make this boy into a great director.The movie is good; but, some of the events that take place are creepy and 'cowardly' in the sense that, to me, hurting defenseless women is not-cool! The surveillance parts where Peter Miller (Keith Gordon) follows up leads to his mom's murder, is fantastic! Probably based upon director Brian De Palma's surveillance on his dad as instructed by his mom!?!? When I first saw this movie as a boy of fourteen, I thought that the shower scene (as opposed to ""Psycho"") where the man grabs Angie Dickinson by the 'Dickinson' was ""FANTASTIC!"" But, now I know it was a body-double!?!? This is an o.k. movie, but, it isn't one of those movies you'd want to watch over and over, as it contains the senseless killing of a woman, which I consider cowardly; and, it's creepy like ""Friday The 13th;"" ""Halloween;"" and, ""Nightmare On Elm Street"" where women are killed by a creep.

104,erwan_ticheler,A Bad Hitchcock rip off,8,17 July 2004,"SPOILERSBrian de Palma is a director who made very good movies like THE UNTOUCHABLES and CARRIE,but DRESSED TO KILL has got none of the tension and good acting of those films.The film is a remake of Hitchcock's classic PSYCHO but it also has copied scenes of VERTIGO and,very strangely,CARRIE.The acting is not good,not even Michael Caine gives a good performance.The movie starts like a cheap erotic flick and goes on like one.Fans of De Palma will probably say that this is good but I think that it perverts Hitchcock's work,in which the sexual references were much more subtle and therefore,in the end,much better worked out. The museum scene is overlong and a definite copy of the scenes with Kim Novak in VERTIGO.The killing of Angie Dickinson is a copy of the shower scene in PSYCHO as is Dickinson's character(a woman who is prominent in every scene until she gets murdered half way).The scene in which Caine's motives are explained is literally a copy of the final scene in PSYCHO.The final scene is a copy of De Palma's own movie CARRIE,why did he do that,you ask.The tricks,that are numerous in the film,are not necessary.They are just to show of.No,this isn't a good film.  4/10",Dressed to Kill
105,iago-6,Longer on technique than story,8,17 March 2006,"De Palma's technique had hit its high maturity by the time of this film, which is a wonderful showcase of his classic techniques, though unfortunately, as with many of the films written by De Palma himself, the story serves the meta more than the interests of putting forth an emotionally compelling tale. The story opens with a CRAZY scene in which Angie Dickinson masturbates in a shower while she looks at her husband. She is then grabbed and raped while he husband stands obliviously near-and the whole thing is revealed to be Angie's fantasy as he husband is pumping mindlessly away at her in bed. She has a short scene with her son, a dead ringer for Harry Potter, which concludes with a joke that ""she'll tell grandma that he is playing with his peter."" She then goes to her therapy session, where she complains about her dead marriage, before attempting to seduce her therapist, Michael Caine. He refuses, and she is hurt and feeling unattractive and unfulfilled.Then begins a bravura 22-minute nearly wordless sequence that is perhaps the highlight of the film. Among the many things De Palma gleaned from Hitchcock is the understanding of film as a purely visual medium of telling stories and in typical De Palma fashion, he turns this into a way to show off his formidable skill. The problem, for me, is that in this instance one begins to feel that scenes are being needlessly protracted simply to further show off the director's skill. The sequence begins with Angie at an art museum. She watches strangers, all involved in sexual or family activities, then begins to get turned on to a man sitting next to her. De Palma very skillfully tells an extremely complicated narrative without a single word about Angie's attraction, embarrassment, retreating, and finally finding and submitting to the stranger in the back of a taxi cab, all set to a wonderfully lush score by Pino Donaggio, who also scored Carrie.In the second part of the sequence Angie has slept with the guy, and gets up to return to her husband. Again De Palma crams a ton of narrative in without a word of dialogue uttered, as Angie realizes that she doesn't have her panties, that her husband is already home and no doubt wondering where she is, that she has probably contracted a venereal disease, and that she has lost her engagement ring somewhere in the shuffle. It's all very admirable, but one begins to feel a little strung along as we are forced to do things like take a long elevator ride down from the seventh floor, then up again, almost in real time....Spoilers from here on out! When Angie reaches the seventh floor again, she is killed by a big woman with blond hair. The woman hacks away at her until she reaches the ground floor, when the door opens and Nancy Allen sees her there. There is a wonderful slow-motion sequence as Nancy reaches into the elevator, Angie reaches up toward her, and the killer's blade is held poised to slash Nancy's hands. Then follow some electrifying shots as Nancy looks up and sees the killer in the elevators convex mirror. It's all good, and by the time we have some dialogue again, you think; ""Woah, that was just 22 straight minutes of purely visual narrative!"" Or maybe you don't, but I do.A younger Dennis Franz has a great part as a sleazy and tough New York detective who would rather that everyone else do his work for him. He Interviews Michael Caine, making the outrageous implication (though it passes as commonplace) that Angie WANTED to be killed. Angie's son is there as well, and he hooks up with Nancy, and they set about to spy on Caine's therapist and find out who the killer is.Once again there is a strong tie to a Hitchcock film, in this case Psycho (just as Obsession is a re-working of Vertigo). You have a woman who we are supposed to understand is secretly a slut, who gets killed in the first 30 minutes in an enclosed space, in this case an elevator rather than a shower. Then the relatives of the deceased conduct an investigation, which reveals that the killer is a man who dresses as a woman to kill. De Palma even throws in a doctor at the end who explains the psychology of the whole thing. It is very interesting, but at the same time a viewer can begin to feel a bit jerked around, and that is my primary reservation about this film. It is definitely essential viewing and showcases some of De Palma's greatest setpieces, but that feeling that the story is running a solid third behind the need for De Palma to show off and his somewhat unseemly sexual fantasies makes it hard to look back on this one with whole-hearted affection.--- Check out other reviews on my website of bad and cheesy movies, Cinema de Merde, cinemademerde.com",Dressed to Kill
106,danielll_rs,Brilliant Hitchcock homage,9,5 August 2000,"WARNING: SPOILER ALERT""Dressed to Kill"", one of the most famous thrillers from the '80s, divides opinions even 20 years after its release. There are some people who think this is nothing but a blatant rip-off ""Psycho"", including the guys of Razzie Awards, who gave this film three stupid nominations- worst director for Brian DePalma, worst actor for Michael Caine and worst actress for Nancy Allen. But other people think this is a magnificent homage to many Hitchcock pictures, but still having an unique tension and great directing. I stay with those. ""Dressed to Kill"" is an intelligent, intriguing, very tense and memorable classic of the suspense, with terrific homages to the master named Alfred Hitchcock.The story... Well, I really don't want to spoil you, but it's about the investigations of the murder of a middle-aged woman named Kate Miller (Angie Dickinson), committed by a mysterious woman inside an elevator. The only witness was a prostitute named Liz Blake (Nancy Allen), who saw the murderer by chance during a blink of eyes. Kate's son, Peter (Keith Gordon), starts to help Liz to discover the identity of the killer, probably one of the clients of Kate's psychiatrist, Robert Elliott (Michael Caine), named ""Bobbi"", who is in fact... Watch to find out!While watching the film, I tried to find all the references to Hitchcock, but maybe I didn't find them all. The first scene, showing Kate dreaming that she was being killed in the shower, is obviously a reference to ""Psycho"", the most referenced here. ""Bobbi"", the man dressed as a woman to kill, is Norman Bates here. The cops discussing the murders in the end was also in ""Psycho"". The identity crisis also... and much more. As you can see, a much more creative, intelligent and interesting thing than what Gus Van Sant did. But if you have some ""Hitchcockian"" knowledge (I wish I had more), you can establish a link between the scene with Dickinson in the museum and Kim Novak in a museum looking at the picture of Carlotta Valdez in ""Vertigo"". And it's not just those references that are homages to Hitchcock. The long shots, the silent scenes (Dickinson in the museum), some characters who just pass by (the little girls in the museum and in the elevator) were also used in many pictures of the master. As you can see, ""Dressed to Kill"" is a real gift to Hitchcock fans as I am. I'm sure he would have been proud of Brian DePalma.But ""Dressed to Kill"" doesn't stay just as a pure homage, but also as a tense, suspenseful, terrifying film. The elevator scene is one of the most memorable of the '80s, the murders are chilling and the suspense takes your to the edge of your seat. Mr. DePalma didn't deserve a nomination for the Razzie Awards, but for the Oscar. In a certain moment, he even divides the screen to show two parallel scenes happening at the same time. Both of them are important and you have to choose which one you will watch. It was, for me, a preparation for ""Time Code"", but just shows how brilliant and well-crafted this film is, and how clever Brian DePalma is.The only problem of ""Dressed to Kill"" is that the end is kind of predictable, but this is not a big complaint in a film where you can't take your eyes off the screen.9 out of 10 = EXCELLENT",Dressed to Kill

108,shaun98,"Good, but somewhat overrated",7,3 April 2002,"DePalma's infamous ""Dressed to Kill"" is a triumph of film technique over content. When one looks at the story in a dispassionate manner, it's obvious how absurd everything is. Yet, it works better than it has any right to, due to directorial flair. The legendary elevator scene is still potent after more than twenty years. Employing slow motion, close-ups, and careful editing, what could have been a standard ""slasher"" scene is transformed into a tour de force of terror. This segment alone is worth the price of admission, and actually rivals the shower scene from Hitchcock's ""Psycho.""
Also of notice is the sequence of events leading up to the killing. The museum chase, in which Dickinson pursues a handsome stranger, is pure visual cinema, telling the story with little dialogue. I also admired the use of split-screen in certain scenes. It's a sorely underused device in modern cinema; this film reminds us that movies are a visual medium, despite their literary roots. From an acting standpoint, both Dickinson and Allen are solid as flawed but strong women who evoke our sympathy, although we might not approve of their actions. Caine is good as a psychologist who may be hiding one of his patients, responsible for the murder. However, Gordon's nerdy character is unconvincing, and Franz's Detective Marino is little more than a shallow caricature. It is impossible to discuss the film without recalling the intense controversity that met its original release. Vilified by feminist groups, DePalma has often been accused of being a misogynist. I must question the validly of this argument. If that were the case, I think he would have made his female characters weak and submissive; objects of scorn. Finally, I tend to agree with Internet critic James Kendrick, who argues that the material was never intended to be taken seriously--although too many people did just that. Judging it purely based on craftsmanship, ""Dressed to Kill"" is not a masterpiece. It's unevenly paced, and the dialogue could have used some tweaking. Still, there are enough good moments to make it worthwhile.Rating: *** (out of ****)Released by Filmways Pictures",Dressed to Kill

The only thing that this film suffers form is some of the corny mugging for the camera during the nude scenes.  Also, the first killing doesn't really hold up as well now, but if you can get past that, this is not a bad way to pass the time.",Dressed to Kill
110,timmy_501,"DePalma explores sex, violence, and gender identity to maximum cinematic effect",10,26 October 2012,"Dressed to Kill, which many viewers seem to have dismissed as a mere riff on Alfred Hitchcock's Psycho, is actually an excellent film in its own right. Director Brian DePalma establishes a disturbing, highly sexualized atmosphere right from the surreal opening, which explores the nude body of a showering woman at length as she eyes a towel-clad male companion expectantly. Suddenly, her expectations are shattered by the entrance of a murderous interloper. This scene, with its mixture of sexuality and violence, prefigures the film's main narrative. The plot combines the formulas of the slasher film and the detective film. The slasher character exudes menace while the detectives, amateur and professional alike, exhibit just the right amount of quirky personality. The film's genre mishmash makes it rather similar to the giallo films of the 1970s, which were themselves greatly influenced by Hitchcock. Yet DePalma proves to be in a class of his own as he uses unconventional visual techniques such as split screen to build tension and suspense. At the same time, DePalma's mastery of more conventional shots helps Dressed to Kill transcend the work of his contemporaries and influences alike. Thematically, DePalma deals with some of the same issues that Hitchcock explored in Psycho, specifically gender identity and violence caused by repressed sexuality. However, whereas Hitchcock was overly concerned with spelling out new concepts and reducing them to textbook abnormal psychology tidbits for his audience, DePalma is content to leave a certain aura of mystery to the actions of his killer. Even a slightly stilted expository scene in a police station is all but forgotten in the wake of the film's stunning ending.",Dressed to Kill

Body Double, The Fury and Carrie are better movies but this movie is better than Blow Out and Obsession. De Palma is very influenced by Hitchcock and this movie is a take off on Psycho. Angie Dickinson is a bored housewife who is thinking of having an affair and after her psychiatrist, played by Michael Caine, turns down an offer, Dickinson meets a man in a art gallery and she winds up sleeping with him. After this point it's best you don't know what happens but there is a murder and Nancy Allen is a call girl who gets a look at the killer. Dennis Franz is the detective on the case who really doesn't trust Allen and she has to find the killer herself. It's a pretty good movie but isn't one of De Palma's best.",Dressed to Kill

I was surprised because Brian De Palma's movies tend to be hit or miss for me. If you like suspenseful movies, there's no reason for you not to like ""Dressed to Kill"". It might come off as a little bit of a ""Psycho"" ripoff at times, but since I've heard De Palma was a big fan of Hitchcock, I think any similarities are intentional and in homage to Hitchcock rather than trying to rip him off.I only had one minor complaint about the movie, I feel like they REALLY went into detail at the end to make sure you knew what happened, which was OK, but I feel like they didn't have to explain it as thoroughly as they did. It's almost like the filmmakers were afraid the audience wouldn't pick up on what was going on, or if they did, were afraid they wouldn't understand why what happened did happen.I think had they had a little bit more faith in the audience's ability to understand what was going on it would've been just a bit better, but like I said it's a minor complaint.I give it an eight out of ten!

113,stonedraim,A ride down the alley of Mr. De Palma.,7,14 June 2016,"**** May contain strong spoilers ****This is a review made by StoneDraim... and that means that if you want to read a probably different kind of review, keep reading....This is my personal experience, my personal point of view/perspective and my personal opinion... and my opinion is just one of like 7 billions in this world.Typical Brian De Palma movie magic, this movie begins like a blend of a romantic adult scene and a deeply psychological thriller with a little touch of ""Psycho"". Were I surprised and a little chocked over all the details that were shown during the woman's shower? Yes, I was.About 16 minutes into this one, there is an epic scene where the lady is at an art gallery. Her emotions and impressions is very effectively enhanced by the wonderful orchestra doing the music in a almost Italian sense of way. Her desperation is matched perfectly by the strings. Just the fact to give about 5 minutes of a movie describing a sexual frustrated woman's own inner war in chasing a man, then turning the back to the man, losing her glove to the man and chasing him in a subtle way is fantastic! These five minutes following the opening scene is showing what is going on inside of her. A successful lady bored of life and starting to walk the edge of experimental minds a little too much... to the edge of madness.Brian De Palmas usual technique of camera angles and zoomings blended together with close shots is all over the place and gives ""Dressed to kill"" that special Mr. De Palma touch.Amazing work on the script. Almost 35 minutes of the entire movie is spent to the woman and her life in more than one way. Then she is killed and the main character is suddenly all gone... the story turns around and continues with other characters following that. Piece of art! The killing is very intense and blood is floating everywhere. The razor is drawn along the woman's throat and in details I can witness the brutality. From a observation in psychology into this immediately and effective turn. Well done, Mr. De Palma!1 hour and 35 minutes... I am in awe! Like a psychological version of an insane asylum with the touch of....yes... Dracula.... with an escaping patient rounding it off in ""Psycho"" way!Over to the movie as a product: - The production : Brian De Palma. All through a great production from 1980. Pino Dinaggio's score lifts it up a great deal. - The actors : Michael Caine is.... Michael Caine; hooray! He delivers every time. Nancy Allen.... I saw Robocop and went crazy on her good skills. Now... well....... From 1980 to 1987 of Robocop, she made the major leap, let me tell you that. Besides that, good acting on the behalf of the other actors. Dennis Franz is making a hilarious portray of a little over the edge experienced civil ""cop"". - The story : Major twists makes this a solid top notch story. From a little intense drama to a combination of thriller, crime and detective mystery thing. - Entertainment : Hard to really appreciate it to the fullest 36 years later. Even so... more than good. - Age : 15. A good old slashing makes the age pop up more than 5 years.7,0 out of 10. (The final rate is based most on my own entertainment of the movie. Short elucidation of the rating: 7 Well made movie. Proper entertainment.)",Dressed to Kill
114,jed-estes,De Palma Steps in to a New Decade,7,3 September 2006,"In this film Brian De Palma shows that he is ready to move forward with his film-making and grow into a legend and not just a go to guy like he was in the 70's and late 60's. This is his only horror effort of the decade and his next to last that he has done of this writing, the last one being 1992's Raising Cain. I am somewhat glad De Palma left the horror field behind as it did not really suit his visual style. I love Carrie, and Phantom of the Paridse, but see The Fury as a mess and 1973's Sisters as a travesty of wasted film. De Palma's skills are more well suited for action and dramatic suspense, not Horror suspense. This is not to say that I do not love the horror genre, believe me I do, I just find that Brian De Palma has fared much better with his action and personal stories better than the horror. Dressed to Kill, is a good movie that falls somewhere between the greatness of Carrie and the dullness of The Fury. In parts of Dressed to Kill like when Angie Dickenson finds that she may have contracted an STD and all the suspense that surrounds that and what leads up to her death are all good scenes. Some of the Kieth David stuff is intriguing but I find him not to be a very good actor and am glad he is pretty much gone from the scene now. The only good performance he ever gave was in Jaws II and look how little he does in that film. He is better as a sidekick and not a star. Nancy Allen is wonderful and hot as always. This is during the prime of her career and when she was married to De Palma and could still generate good jobs. That all ended after her turn in the Robocop series. Michael Cain is superb as always in this film. It's nice to see him as the villain for a change and not as the old British dude that turns up in every film now to give it integrity, even if the film does not deserve his talents. De Palma him self does a good job on this getting past the crap fest that was The Fury and tries to bring a faster pace to this one. He sorta succeeds. His next effort Blow Out would be a worse movie than this, but 1983's Scarface the follow up to that would ultimately be one of De Palma's best. I feel he learned how to please 80's audience with the fastness of this film and somewhat good story of Blow Out combined with a drug scenario and made Scarface the crowning achievement it is. Watch Dressed to Kill to see a master grow, Nacy Allen, and a nice turn by Michael Cain.",Dressed to Kill
115,roddekker,A Cross-Dressing Kook Who Kills For Thrills,6,23 October 2016,"Released in 1980 - Dressed To Kill (directed by Brian De Palma) is a stylishly gruesome horror story about sexual frustration, madness, and the insatiable blood-thirst of a pug-ugly, homicidal transvestite.So, I ask you - How does one intelligently discuss the rightful merits of this highly trendy horror/thriller without first seriously comparing it to Alfred Hitchcock's classic, slasher-flick - Psycho? It can't be done. The parallel in directorial style and technique between these 2 films is just too blatantly obvious.To say that director De Palma ""borrowed"" like a literal psycho-maniac from Hitchcock for this picture would surely be an understatement.Now, I'm not saying that this was necessarily a bad thing..... It's just that when it comes to the art of blatant borrowing, this film in question is so easily unmasked as being nothing more than a pale imitation. And that inevitably destroys any potential originality that it might have had to offer on its own merits, thus leaving it entirely exposed, like an opened target, to endless criticism, both negative and comparative.",Dressed to Kill
116,KatMiss,DEPALMA'S BEST FILM,10,13 July 2001,"""Dressed to Kill"" is Brian DePalma's best film, an absolute thrill ride of suspense, humor and style that remains unrivaled today. DePalma has a bum rap in Hollywood, as most people claim that he rips off Alfred Hitchcock. He does not. Hitchcock could only dream of what DePalma shows in his thrillers.Sadly, the original uncut version of ""Dressed to Kill"" is no longer available on video. The current copy released by Goodtimes is the Jack Valenti approved R rated cut. But some copies of DePalma's original cut still exist. It is the one distributed by Warner Home Video, in both a green cardboard box with Angie Dickinson on the cover, or in a black clamshell case  with the theatrical poster on silver lining. These are the ones to get, if you can find a copy. I have the green one and it is among my treasured possessions.Anyway, back to the story. Dickinson plays Kate Miller, a sexually frustrated wife who is being treated by Dr. Robert Elliott ( Michael Caine) for her obsessive fantasies. While on a trip to the museum (a real tour-de-force for DePalma in terms of camera work and suspense), Miller is picked up by a stranger. You can pretty much guess what happens to her, since the ads and box art give away the story. But there are a few complications. A hooker (Nancy Allen) is the sole witness to the murder. Kate Miller's son Peter (Keith Gordon) is a teenage genius determined to solve the crime. And Dr. Elliott's answering machine has a certain message on it...about a missing razor...I'm not spoiling the film at all for you since what I have described above takes place within the opening half hour and DePalma's biggest surprises are reserved for the last hour. This film is explicit, however, enough for Valenti (head of the MPAA) to demand cuts in the film. What surprises me is what cuts he wanted. Several cuts in the opening shower scene and one or two slashing scenes and some of Nancy Allen's dialogue (Valenti wanted ""cock"" changed to ""bulge""). This is a film that is very violent and bloody, yet the objections are to sexual content. I'd love to hear Valenti's explaination at how seeing two women in a tender love scene in ""Lost and Delirious"" is somehow more damaging to a young mind than Arnold Schwarzenegger blowing away people with a chain gun. It just isn't fair.What makes ""Dressed to Kill"" so good is that not only are the technical credits first rate, but the performances are very good as well. Michael Caine, who was in a lot of crap in this time period, gives one of his best performances as the doctor. Angie Dickinson is better than usual, possibly because she actually has a strong role here. Nancy Allen adds this to her range of performances that has her pegged as one of the most underrated and overlooked actresses in the world. Keith Gordon is wonderful as the genius and i loved all those inventions of his.DePalma is one of our best directors who has never received the recognition he deserved. The recent joke of the AFI 100 Best Thrillers list showed that very few people actually know what a thriller is. If they were to actually open their eyes for once, they would see that DePalma has staked his career in thrillers and is actually the best craftsman. This is even better than ""Psycho"". It's a shame that very few actually know that.**** out of 4 stars",Dressed to Kill
117,blazesnakes9,De Palma is the Master of the Macabre.,8,11 February 2016,"When Alfred Hitchcock died in 1980, there was only one person that could take over for the thriller genre. And that was Brian De Palma. De Palma, at this point in his career, was already making movies since the early 1970's. So far, he's made 3 feature length movies, including Sisters, from 1973, Carrie, from 1976 and Obsession, which was also released around the same year Carrie was released. Now, he brings an brand new thriller to the table.Dressed to Kill is an exceptionally well made Hitchcockian thriller that's filled with erotic charged imagery and well-written characters that make the movie work well. Angie Dickinson plays a sexually frustrated housewife who can't seem to find satisfaction in her life. Her teenage son, (Keith Gordon), is a science geek who can't seem to fit in with his mother since his father left them for another woman. Dickinson's character even visits a local psychiatrist in New York City, played by Michael Caine. At first, Dickinson tries seducing him, but it fails. That night, after visiting a stranger in a museum, she decides to stay with him for the night. But, as soon as the night is over, she's brutally murdered in a elevator by a tall, blonde, woman, wielding a straight razor.While all of this is going on, an call girl, (Nancy Allen), is questioned by the police since she witnessed the murder right in front of her. Meanwhile, the son wants revenge on his mother's murder. So, he and the call girl decides to track down the killer whatever means necessary.Like other Brian De Palma's thrillers, Dressed to Kill renders on the Hitchcockian genre. The murder scene reminds us of the shower scene in Psycho with its portrayal of shock and awe, but what's interesting about this film is that it doesn't rip off that famous scene. What I expected out of Brian De Palma's other works is that he simply takes several Hitchcock's films and flips on its head. Even though there're several plot holes in this movie, I enjoyed the style more than the story.As for the performances, Michael Caine does a good job, playing Dickinson's therapist. As for Angie Dickinson, she particularly steals the movie by giving us a very good performance as the troubled housewife. What I like also about Dressed to Kill is that Dickinson doesn't seem to be playing a helpless victim in this movie. Various people protest about the violence against women in this movie. But, to make things very clear, this movie is a lot more better than a dozen of slasher movies. This is an enjoyable thriller that does have a lot of style, but for the story, it does suffered a slight bump in the road for me. The music score by Pino Donaggio is quite splendid and beautiful at the same time. As I watching this movie, I could see that De Palma was trying so hard to make this movie closer to a Hitchcockian thriller and to tell you the truth, he does succeeds. Not only for this movie, but for another movie that he made four years later after this one, Body Double. With the pieces almost fitting together, Dressed to Kill is an frightening, erotic thriller with style and substance. ★★★ 1/2 3 1/2 stars.",Dressed to Kill
118,Sherparsa,erm ... well ... where was i?,1,3 July 2018,"O yes ...was just telling how extremely BAD a director De Palma is ... i mean i have seen at least a couple of notable movie he made ...

119,jamhorner,One of De Palma's Best Works,8,14 July 2009,"This is movie was a wonderful horror/thriller in the style of Hitchcockian storytelling and even, in some way, is a tribute to Hitchcock's ""Psycho."" That's why I think that ""Dressed to Kill"" is one of De Palma's best works of modern horror but why is it that this movie was so controversial and gained so much critical response?This movie is a dark look into human sexuality, where few people are what they seem and the movie is driven by erotic visuals and sexual violence. It is because of these themes this movie was subject to much ridicule and criticism especially from Feminists. This is one of the first mainstream erotic thriller movies to have been such a blockbuster success and what's interesting enough is how acclaimed it later was considering how risky it was for its time.The acting in the movie was so-so but what made this movie so memorable was the technical aspect and the 'interesting' character development. From a cinematic standpoint, De Palma uses a wide variety of techniques that he used in his early work such as split screens, sound layering, voyeuristic and canted camera angles all of which are used to manipulate the audience. What we get in the end is a roller-coaster ride of emotions.There are so many themes of sexuality, gender roles and stereotypes/profiling to fit into one review although what I can say, without hesitation, is that this movie is one of De Palma's best work.",Dressed to Kill

121,kyle_c,*** 1/2 out of ****,8,14 November 2002,"Sure, ""Dressed to Kill"" borrows from ""Psycho"", but it certainly has the power to stand on it's own.  De Palma adds his trademark visual stylings to a fascinating and disturbing plot.  Some truly magnificent set pieces - De Palma's strength is in his ability to tell a story with just a camera, and little dialogue.  The script is very good, and Michael Caine delivers his usual excellent performance.  However, the main reason why this film is so great is because it is superior filmmaking, pure and simple, by a man who knows how to make films.",Dressed to Kill
122,matheusmarchetti,"Brian De Palma's ""Psycho""",10,5 April 2008,"Brian De Palma has often been cited as 'the new Hitchcock' and 'the Ultimate Master of Suspense'. Although I don't like to compare his films to Hitchcock, this is a direct homage (or some might say, rip-off) to Hitchcock's classics, specially - Psycho. As a matter of fact, ""Dressed to Kill"" can be seen as a modern update on that film, set in 1980's New York filled with Dario Argento overtones and an overall gialli feel, and it actually succeeds! ""Dressed to Kill"" is such a fascinating film, and works on every level. The story, the visuals, the score (by the great DePalma regular Pino Donnagio), nice kills and gore (the elevator murder scene is one of the classic moments of the horror and thriller genres) and the pace is very good. The film never gets boring, always keeping you on the edge of your seat. The use of black humor is a great addition to the film as well. Another thing that I like is how uneven the main characters are: a adulterous middle aged housewife (in many ways, a parody of Janet Leigh's Marion Crane from Psycho), a nerdy teen and a prostitute. They are all very well developed, and just because they are so unusual, we sympatize with them a lot. It was a wise move from DePalma. Overall, although it is not my favorite DePalma film (my favorite would be the criminally underrated Phantom of the Paradise), Dressed to Kill is an excellent film. Highly recommended.",Dressed to Kill
123,ronfernandezsf,Copy cat,4,10 November 2018,"While this is a copy cat of a couple of Hitchcock films it's still rather enjoyable if you can get past the many plot holes. Why have a lady cop follow the girl like she's going to kill her. To throw audiences off from the real killer, but it doesn't make sense. How did the killer know Angie was going back to the 7th floor to retrieve her ring? She could have just gone home. How did the killer know exactly where she was and took a chance of waiting all day without being seen. Also the cop was very unethical in the way he wanted the Nancy Allen character to spy. So much just doesn't make sense. Having said all this it is still a stylish erotic thriller. See at your own expense.",Dressed to Kill

The movie has many intense moments create via the use of camera angles, music scores, and every day normal props like mirrors, showers, steam, and rain.  This movie doesn't go over the top with blood and gore, but does leave you guessing as to who the murderer is throughout the film.  The misdirection used in the movie is excellent and makes the climax of the film that much better.  Its an excellent movie if you like disturbing thrillers that don't give away the whole movie in the first 30 minutes.",Dressed to Kill
125,Ben-Hibburd,Dressed to Kill Review.,8,22 July 2017,"Dressed to Kill is written and directed by Brian de Palma. This film is essentially a hybrid between an American erotic thriller and a Italian Giallo. It features all the hallmarks of both genres of that time, a crazed slasher, sultry female leads, and buckets of blood, the only thing missing from this films is a synth score by Goblin or Tangerine Dream. This film has a far better structure then most Giallos. Even if this comes at the cost of not being surprised by who the killer is.Brian de Palma brings an extra level of finesse to this film. It's a more mature take on the Giallo genre, without it ever skimping out on De Palma's usual motifs. The shot compositions and his excellent camera movements are as good as any in his filmography.The film stars Nancy Allen as Liz Blake a high-class call girl, that witnesses a murder, and soon finds herself in the killers cross-hairs. Allen gives an alluring performance as the seductive Liz Blake. Even though her acting chops begin to stifle in any scene that requires any range or emotional weight. Though at times she's given some truly horrendous lines, that even George Lucas would cringe at.The film also stars Michael Caine as therapist Dr. Robert Elliott. After the murders begin he starts to receive messages on his answering machine, from one of his former patients, giving accurate accounts of the murder whilst claiming to be the killer. He begins to fall deeper into trouble, as he tries to reach out and help his former patient. He goes off on his his own Investigation, without the help of Police Detective. Marino who's played with typical gusto by Dennis Franz. The cast is rounded out with good performances from Angie Dickinson as Kate Miller a patient of Elliott's and Keith Gordon who plays her son.Dressed to Kill does have some issues, the dialogue at times can be rough on the ear, and the overall mystery is fairly simplistic, which leads to a slight lack of tension. Despite this, Dressed to Kill is an Incredibly fun and engaging film. It's masterfully shot, and is one of the best hybrid Giallos Iv'e seen.",Dressed to Kill
126,Mario64,"Good thriller, with great moments",7,12 January 2006,"May contain minor spoilers.Dressed to Kill, having just seen it for the first time the other day, is a movie with some terrific sequences, some decent performances, and a nice, though obvious Hitchcock ripoff, plot twist at the end. It's just too bad certain things, quite obvious, prevent it from being a classic.Dressed to Kill deals with a mystery of a killer who has slain at least two women (could have been more but the movie never tells us), and the search for the killer by three people: a brainy kid whose mom was a victim, a lively hooker whose the only one who can identify the killer, and a psychiatrist whose patient was the slained brainy kid's mother. There are a host of well done performances including Nancy Allen as the hooker Liz, Angie Dickenson as the sexually frustrated victim Kate Miller, and Micheal Caine as Doctor Rober Elliot whose has more hidden than meets the eye; though by no standard is anyone really outstanding. On the other hand Denis Franz, later to be a great character along the same lines on the hit show NYPD Blue, is embarrassing as an over-exaggerated, ruthless, hateful detective, though he takes little screen time so it doesn't hurt the movie that much. Keith Gordon, the brain child, is decent, but is almost too smart to really be believable.What sticks with me the most in the film are the tense sequences. The scene with the sexually frustrated mother at the museum is gripping and well done, as is the later sequence leading to her untimely death. I also love the sequence at the doctor's office, that reveals the identity of the killer, which really makes the whole film come together at once. And there's a split screen scene that I thought was almost classic. Still there's another situation when Liz is on a train, running from what may be the killer, that gets taken in directions it should never had with almost embarrassing racial stereotypes. As a thriller it's tense and quite often believable. As a crime drama it often falters, especially with the incomplete, ridiculous explanation of everything that happened in the end. There's also a needless, and way too long, dream sequence at the end, in which they had the audacity to shoot someone's foot for what seemed minutes at a time. This was an up and down experience; one scene would catch me by the heart and mind with enticement, and the next would make me squirm and ask why. At more than 100 minutes this could have been under 90 and been a better film.Scary movie fans should like this. It still stands as a better film than most of today's slasher flicks. Maybe it was a better film in it's time, but having just seen it recently I can say I enjoy it, and it is worth watching for my three favorite scenes alone.",Dressed to Kill
127,sampleman411-1,"Dial ""M"" for More Violence",7,26 April 2002,"De Palma's finest shocker... the director emulated Alfred Hitchcock in this more urban-sophisticated version of ""Psycho,"" giving us the actual skin cutting instead of the mere suggestion of it (courtesy of the currently available DVD Unrated version).  The carnage takes place the first third of the film, and you'd be advised not to get too settled in this one because, who knows, there are more victims' lives to claim, and the straight razor is still missing.Angie Dickinson does an admirable job, and says a few interesting things in one of several documentaries included on the DVD.  De Palma is just now really getting his due as a director of considerable merit.  It wasn't always so, especially since ""Dressed to Kill"" outraged (and shocked) many people when it was first released... female or not... and the reverberation from its violent impact is still felt by audiences today.

128,johnm_001,One of the Best,10,13 October 2000,"""Dressed To Kill"", is one of the best thrillers ever made.  Its dealings with sex and violence make this a film for adults.  Brian De Palma, once again, proves why no other director can match his use of the camera to tell a story.  He directs many scenes without dialog, and he tells much of his story, strictly through the use of his visuals, and Pino Donnagio's brilliant score.  Filmed in Panavision, the film MUST be seen in widescreen, as De Palma uses the entire width of the film to tell his story.  Cropped, on video, ""Dressed To Kill"", is barely the same movie.  Solid performances from its cast, superb direction, and, perhaps, the finest film score ever written, make ""Dressed To Kill"" a must see.",Dressed to Kill
129,AttyTude0,Cheesy and amateurish!,1,16 October 2013,"Oh, my goodness. Where does one begin? When I read that this film was considered scandalous in its time, I had to laugh. Scandalous? Why? Because there is brief nudity and sex in it? Come on, this is 20 years after the sexual revolution! Shocking? Seriously? The critics and audience were shocked by what, exactly? Cheesy special effects? The sight of Angie Dickinson covered in, uh, ""blood""? It looked more like she had an accident with a bottle of Chianti. In 1980 Hollywood still couldn't figure out the color of blood (rolleye).Look, at my venerable age I can safely say I have witnessed a good bit of the evolution of the film industry. Nobody likes a good old classic more than I. Also, I'm always ready to make concessions to the passing of years, and the lack of technology in olden times, and all the rest of it. But there are some thins that are timeless. Bad taste and lack of talent are two of them, and I regret to say this film is sadly afflicted by both. In matters of defects this film has it all: bad direction, bad writing (I literally winced at some of the dialogue), bad ""special effects,"" bad acting (that Franz guy's performance is painfully hammy). Nancy Allen is a cute kid with a good figure, but she can't act. Even Michael Cain renders a pedestrian performance, and how can you blame him! His appearance in such a dud only proves that even good actors sometimes just need the money. I could crash the system by enumerating the boo-boos in this turkey. The body double in the shower. The fact that Dickinson is obviously wearing stockings in the museum, but appears bare-legged in the taxi (and no, not thanks to Whatshisname). The unmistakable Michael Cain in drag, as the assassin. Heck, I've seen more convincing disguises on Halloween. And that scene at the hospital! And that's just to name the most obvious.Obviously there is no account for taste, so if you like De Palm a, well, to each his own. I think he's awful. Carrie was a high-school Halloween prank, and I am ashamed to confess I watched Blow Out ... in its entirety (I was young and bored at the time). DTK is more of the same bad thing.

130,210west,Surprisingly hokey and dated,4,10 June 2016,"Prompted by the new documentary on De Palma, I finally sat down and watched this film. Maybe I shouldn't have been surprised, but I was: It's really nothing but a tarted-up giallo, the sort of thing Mario Bava or Dario Argento might have made, only with a 20-times-bigger budget and at least one bigger star. Like the Italian giallos, it has a complicated, thoroughly preposterous comic-book-Hitchcock plot, the same salaciousness, the same lurid violence, the same air of unreality. However, where Argento films tend to have jarringly inappropriate electronic rock scores, this one has an equally inappropriate lush romantic score that reminded me of a high-priced supper club. Granted, context is everything. If ""Dressed to Kill"" were the work of some little-known Italian genre specialist, I'm sure I'd be praising it right now. I like giallos. Lurid and preposterous? Not a problem. But for a well-regarded (if controversial) Hollywood box-office hit, the film seems stupid, fakey, and somewhat distasteful. Even with a body double, you'd think Angie Dickinson would have been embarrassed by it.I actually found myself looking away at times -- not because of the excessive (and really pretty gratuitous) blood and nudity, but because of the horribly stilted acting by Dickinson and, even worse, by Nancy Allen. I guess it's been said a million times, but wow, the latter certainly was lucky to have been married to De Palma. It's hard to imagine any other way she'd ever have been cast. (Nice lady, I'm sure. Pleasant enough in ""Strange Invaders."")The film is currently 35 years old, and it feels it. The plot seems crude. The action scenes, sometimes in slow motion, feel stagey and unreal. The police-procedural aspects and the scenes involving psychotherapy also seem unreal (though that sort of thing is par for the course in giallos). What also felt dated -- and, God knows, politically incorrect by today's standards -- was the treatment of blacks and transsexuals, though I must admit this seemed downright refreshing. P.S. I once had a long conversation with a film-school student who'd just won some sort of college-level directing award, and I remember asking him whom he regarded as the most overrated director then working. Without much of a pause, he said, ""Brian De Palma"" -- which I thought was a pretty good answer. Still, I do very much enjoy ""Phantom of the Paradise"" and ""Carlito's Way.""",Dressed to Kill

132,grybop,Disappointing,6,26 January 2002,"Dressed to kill started off as a very promising piece of art (because DePalma's direction IS art, at least during the first half of the film) but eventually didn't live up to my expectations. I was fascinated by the camera work and by the long scenes where the real protagonist is the music. ""A silence more eloquent than any word could ever be"", goes an old Suzanne Vega song (Night vision, 1987), and in fact, there are some sequences in Dressed to kill that can be perfectly described with this phrase. The camera work left me breathless and agonizing during the chase / hide-and-seek scene in the museum, but I was simultaneously carried away by the poetic combination of rapid angle changes with that fascinating piece of music.Anyway, my excitement soon wore off as the story unfolded, leaving huge question marks in my head about the credibility of what was going on and making me angry with the easy solutions that the writer resorted to towards the end of the film.

Fans of the director won't be disappointed.,7,23 May 2010,"Brian DePalma's attempt at paying homage to director Alfred Hitchcock and his movie Psycho,among others, comes across more as a blatant rip-off. However, despite this I ended up liking the film. I never felt bored. Actually, some of the reasons why I did enjoy the movie as much as I did were in part because of DePalma and his directing style.I found the movie to be captivating even though it got increasingly silly as it went along. DePalma's over-stylization and brazen references to Hitchcock kept me wanting to watch more. His self-indulgent tracking shots did become annoying after awhile, but these flourishes are to be expected from him. All the wild plot twists, excessiveness and over-the-top presentation of the whole thing made the movie even more entreating. Sure, it's trashy, lurid and exploitative, but these elements sets this movie apart from other thrillers. It's a good film that's fun to watch. Michael Cane's scenery chewing performance was great to watch. It's too bad Brian DePalma hasn't directed a half-decent film in years.",Dressed to Kill
136,paul_johnr,I'm afraid to shave,9,19 May 2008,"Few people have a lukewarm opinion of Brian De Palma's films. His public usually divides between adulation that ranks De Palma with the likes of Alfred Hitchcock and repulsion that tags him as a derivative, misogynistic hack. When emotions are running this high, every film put out by such a director will be hot to handle and 'Dressed to Kill,' a 1980 thriller using De Palma's own screenplay, is no exception.'Dressed to Kill' is a film that borrows from earlier sources, most obviously Hitchcock's 'Psycho' and Dario Argento's 'The Bird with the Crystal Plumage.' What raises 'Dressed' above knock-off status, however, is the means by which De Palma uses cliché to explore other possibilities. The film may be derivative, but it's not a plain carbon copy; De Palma, with his American viewpoint and tongue-in-cheek style, puts bizarre spins on old ideas and joins together a superb piece of exploitation cinema.De Palma's screenplay uses a plot line modeled after 'Psycho' that tracks the activities of one woman before splintering off into numerous characters who are given equal weight. The woman in this case is Kate Miller, a suburban New York housewife played by Angie Dickinson. In the film's opening scenes, it becomes clear that Kate is trapped in an unsatisfying relationship with her second husband; we witness an imaginary sequence in which Kate is taken hold by a strange man in her shower, followed by her faking of an orgasm during a real (and quick) meeting in bed.Afterwards, Kate visits Manhattan psychiatrist Robert Elliott (Michael Caine) and expresses her urge to have an affair. Kate then enters the Metropolitan Museum of Art to have lunch with her mother-in-law, instead picking up a male patron (Ken Baker) for an afternoon fling in unconventional places. Suffice it to say that Kate's fling has dire consequences and brings prostitute Liz Blake (Nancy Allen, Golden Globe-nominated), Kate's teenage son Peter (Keith Gordon, eyeglasses and hair predating Harry Potter by two decades), and New York City detective Marino (Dennis Franz) into a twisted murder investigation.While elements of Hitchcock are present, 'Dressed to Kill' actually feels closer to the Italian giallo and, indeed, comparisons have been made. Part of what gives Italian thrillers charm (á la Argento and Mario Bava) is how one film puts customized 'touches' on material used in another. 'Dressed to Kill,' while American, operates in similar ways; Kate Miller, for example, dies in a Psycho-like manner and composer Pino Donaggio's scoring of her death is modeled after Bernard Herrmann. We all want originality in film, but it's also difficult to revitalize old ideas, which De Palma achieves repeatedly. To rank De Palma with Hitchcock may be stretching matters, but he is certainly a director with vision and a distinct style.'Dressed to Kill' would fail totally if not for the strong performance of Angie Dickinson. Dickinson is the center of attention for an entire half-hour and she generates more than enough sympathy to care about what is happening on screen. She is particularly impressive during moments of facial expression and no dialogue, which are moments when De Palma is at his unquestionable best. Michael Caine is the outstanding male lead, playing a seedy role with focus and intensity. Also watch for Dennis Franz's police shtick that carried over to 'Hill Street Blues' and 'NYPD Blue.' Nancy Allen, who was nominated for a Golden Globe and Razzie in the same year (?), gives a strong effort and is quite likable; I just wish her delivery were a little more forceful.The strongest technical element of this film is Pino Donaggio's music. Donaggio's score is breathtaking and one of the few I've heard that can be judged as a self-contained work of art. The music is at times sweepingly romantic, at other times frantic through its chromaticism and impassioned triplets. 'Dressed to Kill' was nicely photographed by Ralf Bode ('Saturday Night Fever,' 'Gorky Park') and Oscar-winning editor Jerry Greenberg ('The French Connection,' 'Apocalypse Now') constructed the film to maximum dramatic effect.While 'Dressed to Kill' has its share of lovers and detractors, MGM Home Entertainment seems to view the film with unusually strong regard. In 2001, MGM released a 'special edition' DVD that no fan of the movie can be without. The film is given widescreen presentation (2.35:1 aspect ratio) with a choice of enhanced Dolby 5.1 English audio, the original English mono track, and French 'dubbing;' subtitles are provided in French and Spanish. Edited before its U.S. release to avoid an 'X' rating from the MPAA, Dressed to Kill's disc supplies both the theatrical and uncut versions for comparison. Extras include a 45-minute documentary on the film's production; a featurette comparing the uncut, R-rated, and network television versions; a featurette on the censorship and negative reaction faced by De Palma; a photo gallery using Donaggio's music; a gallery of advertising materials; and the theatrical trailer.The film's visuals are generally okay, with strong, distinguishable colors. I am not a fan of audio enhancements when the original track was in mono; for 'Dressed to Kill,' I went straight to its mono option because I wanted to hear the film as it sounded in 1980. For some reason, the film has not been restored completely. There is frequent grain, occasional print damage, and noticeable debris such as hair. The extras, however, make up for these problems. De Palma, his crew, and his cast (without Michael Caine) discuss their experiences, including the director's unpleasant situation with the MPAA and feminist groups. It's disappointing not to hear from Michael Caine, but the disc is in need of little else. Filmways Pictures was heading into extinction by the time 'Dressed to Kill' hit cinema screens, but survived long enough to bring De Palma's cult classic into the world.*** ½ out of 4Roving Reviewer - www.geocities.com/paul_johnr",Dressed to Kill

But she is not the killer, and she gets tangled into the web of mystery along with the victim's doctor and son.Okay, let's start with the three 'S'es Sexy- The opening scene is a great moment in sexy cinema (Shower Scene) and the hooker's speech will most likely stick in yous guys' minds.Scary- Threatening voice mails, vicious attacks, bloody murders, stormy nights. Perfectly spine-tingling.Smart- Twisting and turning plot twists, interesting spy gadgets from the victim's son, a real thinker.And the three 'S'es compile to make the 'f' word. No- not THAT 'f' word: Fun!- This movie is just plain fun from beginning to end: Do you not normally watch old movies and you're afraid this will drag? Well don't fear! It's fun!

138,donlessnau-591-637730,Over-cooked titillation. Needed a good director.,6,31 August 2020,"A decent director would have made this into a good thriller. But DePalma is too sleazy. He made this into a cheap, pulp movie. It's ok but he's a dreadful director and Dickinson's sex scenes were laughable. She sounded like she in pain more than enjoying it. But she's a terrible actress too.",Dressed to Kill
139,Oggz,Dressed to impress,8,26 November 2006,"I agree with one of the other users who stated that Hitchcock's ""Psycho"" had already been remade, much earlier than Van Sant's ill-advised 1998 effort - and yes, it was entitled ""Dressed To Kill"". Here we have De Palma at his most affectionate - or audacious, depending on your viewpoint - take on Hitchcock, reselecting, reshuffling and repolishing most of the latter's trade tricks to considerable effect, a clear sign that what audience wanted was now exactly what it was going to get. The end result is uneven but hardly without it's own merit: compare, for argument's sake, the two blatantly related sequences in the two films, the bathroom stabbing of Janet Leigh and the elevator slashing of Angie Dickinson - although humbly derivative, the latter works equally as well if not better, wisely split in several parts, its perverse time elongation elegantly adding to the intensity of terror (we can see Bobbi at work in much more gratuitous detail than Mrs Bates, and she really goes for it, revelling appallingly as she slashes away) - all this achieved by means of clever editing, use of slow motion, nifty camera work and good application of music - and all of which admittedly may seem a bit dated to a younger viewer. On top of that, the museum chase sequence - only in broadest of terms lifted from ""Vertigo"" - has a life, visual language and some languid, desperate beauty of it's own. Elsewhere, the film is littered by clever details, sometimes too subtle to notice first time around - for instance, Mama Dickinson is really being tailed by Bobbi, and Bobbi can indeed be seen following her on the edge of vision - outside the museum as well as in the taxi behind. The gawping little girl in the lift is an emotionally subtle moment, as is Kate Miller's initial light-hearted word play with her son (confidently brought to life by Keith Gordon). There's memorable one-liners too (""What kind of a building IS that? Everyone's getting laid after lunch!"" - snaps Dennis Franz). However, there are also scenes in the film that are quite simply wrong - no self respecting black street thug would be listening to the sort of music heard on the ghetto blaster in the subway sequence - almost a factual mistake, even in 1980. And no other director would be so willing to flaunt his own wife's private bits on screen - but then that's De Palma for you - a Mr De Fetish to the proceedings. Personally, I've no problem with that, as Nancy Allen is good in this, half naked or not - in contrast to Michael Caine's inexplicably absent-minded performance - was John Lithgow unavailable at the time? Pino Donaggio's sub-Morricone music score is largely adequate but within the confines of its regular uneven self, while other aspects of production live up to expectations, technically at least if perhaps not pushing the envelope artistically. Oh, and that strangled nurse must have had some really big feet, for Michael Caine to be supposedly able to slide into her shoes for the film's unnecessarily drawn-out coda. At least Norman Bates wore his own. But hey, Brian, we forgive you. We love ya, really, as much as you love Sir Hitch. And Coppola. and, erm, Argento. And Polanski. And Antonioni. And others....",Dressed to Kill
140,JoshuaMLosapio,"A Cheesy Rip-Off of ""Psycho""",5,31 March 2020,"If you've seen Alfred Hitchcock's ""Psycho,"" then you've already seen ""Dressed to Kill."" Like Hitchcock's masterpiece, ""Dressed to Kill"" focuses on a mysterious blonde who is suddenly killed by a man dressed as a woman one third of the way into the movie. Like ""Psycho,"" the story shifts gears to center around the investigation into the murder. In a twist ending, the killer is revealed to be a man with a split personality. He appears to be a gentleman, but in reality he is a sexually frustrated psychopath who dresses like a woman in order to resolve his psychosis. Both movies open with a love scene, feature a shower sequence that is key to the plot, and even the crucial murder sequence is almost a remake of the now-infamous murder of Marion Crane from the music down to the direction.The similarities are so striking they're beyond homage - from beginning to end ""Dressed to Kill"" plays like a modern remix of ""Psycho"" that neither improves on the Hitchcock classic nor is it entertaining in its own right. Like countless other 1980s thrillers, ""Dressed to Kill"" is a cheap, cheesy, and often silly movie with bad production value and shallow characters. None of the ""scares"" are effective and by the time the main character is killed off, the plot looses momentum and the movie becomes nothing more than a run of the mill horror flick. While the performances are engaging, they're not enough to save the movie from a weak script and uninspired direction. Watch ""Dressed to Kill"" if you have nothing better to do on a Saturday night, but otherwise you should avid this one. 5/10.",Dressed to Kill

142,Shinwa,"A Hitchcock ripoff? Oh, lord, yes. But what a ripoff.",8,16 October 2001,"I've always counted Brian De Palma movies as guilty pleasures, and none of his films lives up to that designation as much as DTK, a labored but gorgeous contribution to the straight-razor fetish school of cinema. It certainly isn't his best film (Carrie, for example, is far better in virtually every respect), and for those who want to seek out its flaws it wears them proudly on its sleeve, but I've always had a fondness for this one; I even have a fondness for the moments I wince at bad dialogue or cloyingly elaborate camera setups.But to respond truthfully to this movie, I have to admit something: I'm not terribly fond of Hitchcock movies. Yes, they're technically masterful, but so often they're icy, mechanical and coy. If I were to go to a hypothetical video store and have to choose between DTK and Vertigo which one I want to see, I'll pick the ripoff; like a Dario Argento movie, you know that you're in the presence of somebody who lets their reach exceed their grasp, and it's kind of refreshing not to have to see so much control. And speaking of Argento, it's not unrealistic to believe that De Palma saw a couple of his movies before conceiving this one. I think it's safe to say that once one accepts that De Palma's plots and technique are not entirely unique, it is still possible to appreciate them on their own merits, and dismissing them out of hand as Hitchcock ripoffs is a copout.DTK is fittingly dressed up. All of the main characters are bourgeois, outwardly civilized and fashionable, which plays off of the inherent sleaziness of the plot mechanics and visual excesses. Of course, there's also De Palma's trademark callousness (after her murder, Dickinson is more or less totally forgotten, except for a few fleeting references...in particular, the character of her son seems notably non-distraught) and a great deal of narrative contortions that do not stand up very well to inspection. But De Palma's self-indulgence is a harmless, fun kind of self-indulgence, a genre film fan making genre films for genre film fans. It's there in the long, LONG, but hilarious museum pursuit scene; in the subway chase (OK, how did the killer know she'd be there? Never mind.); in the curiously effective split-screen and split-split-screen shots which are almost unique to De Palma; in Nancy Allen's disarmingly unconflicted prostitute; in those yes-all-right-we-get-it-now shots of Michael Caine looking into mirrors; in the climactic shower stalking (that nurse must have had really big feet). And it looks bloody terrific the whole way through.",Dressed to Kill
143,Lee-112,Vertigo meets Psycho meets the 80s,7,19 September 1999,"I just watched this movie for the first time the other night on HBO, and I thought it was pretty good.  It's pretty suspenseful, and I thought the performances were pretty good also, even though I'm not much of a Michael Caine fan.  I think the only person that kind of was 'misplaced' was Nancy Allen.  Other than her 'not so good' performance the film was.... alright.Oh, and alright it was a LOT like Vertigo: especially the museum scene, and the beginning shower scene was REALLY misplaced and just another chance to see a naked woman.I watched it with my friends, I must be dumb or something, but they all knew who the killer was, I didn't know until the middle where I figured ""oh ok it MUST be -"", but they all thought it was pretty phony and a waste because they were expecting a murder mystery and just got a murder without the mystery.  And they also thought the ""Carrie"" ending was pretty retarded, it worked in Carrie, but not in this film.  I'm not going to say what happened, but if you've seen Carrie then I think you get the picture.All in all, it's not THAT bad of a film.  If you have time than maybe you'd want to check it out on HBO.  I think I gave this film a 6 or 7.",Dressed to Kill

Imagine the surprise when I got home one week and realised that the guy had slipped me a porno by mistake instead of Brian De Palma's Dressed To Kill! I really wish I could turn back the clock.......Anyway enough of my school days. Dressed to Kill is one of my favourite thrillers. It's packed full of suspense and features a rather intelligent schoolkid.De Palma's humour is evident throughout. This really did fly over me when I was young.

145,info-12388,Here's what you learn from DRESSED TO KILL,1,7 October 2017,"— Sexual pickups always end badly— Transsexuals are mentally disturbed people— Black men on subway platforms are dangerous— Nerdy guys can build anything— If you really put your mind to it, you can wear anything and it will fit just fine, even a nurse's uniform clearly four or five sizes too small.This really has to be one of the worst films I've ever seen, with the one star given it for the cinematography. Everything else — acting, writing, direction, even the freaking music — is so bad that it becomes almost unwatchable halfway through. Never mind that the film starts and ends with naked women taking showers (and no, author of synopsis, Angie isn't taking a shower while her husband is shaving: that entire sequence is a fantasy she needs to get off while her husband is screwing her in the next sequence) with plenty of way over the top shots of naked breasts and vaginae. Never mind that the film's twist that the doctor is actually the killer is glaringly apparent looooong before anyone in the movie figures it out. Never mind tat the music score makes it sound like something from the Hallmark Channel. This thing is just a sad, sad, sad piece of work: misogynist, transphobic, far too sadistic in its use of close-up violence to inform the audience that sex is bad, no matter how it's being carried out.Appalling.",Dressed to Kill
146,mhajs,A movie that begins romantically and goes the way you never expect to. This is what makes a movie so good!,7,14 February 2005,"*** out of ****Yep! Dressed To Kill is that kind of a movie. It's like Kalifornia, but it's different. Remember? That movie from 1993 which stars Brad Pitt as a serial killer who is ""welcomed"" by a couple of travelers in a trip to California as a buddy who might be a good company along the way. When I watch a movie, I always like not to know anything at all about the plot, before watching it, because the surprises may get even cooler. That's how it was with Kalifornia. When I watched it last year for the first time, I never realized it was a suspense movie, so when I found out, I was shocked, and when the movie went on and on, it got even better and I was at the edge of my seat, almost kissing my monitor, so close I was to it! So, we're discussing about Dressed To Kill, right? Before I watched this movie (today!), I've only watched 2 others movies from Brian De Palma, so I can say I don't really know that well his works, but can tell from afar that these 2 movies for me were as great as they could be. Carrie (1976) and Mission:Impossible (1996). When I watched Carrie on the TV, I was really that desperate to get a DVD copy and I can tell: this movie is great! Mission:Impossible also. And today, I watched a third movie from DePalma. Well, Dressed To Kill is a movie like Kalifornia. When the movie goes on, it goes completely different than what you'd expect. I was watching, very curious, the scene of the museum, where Dickinson follows the mysterious man to his cab and they end together in an apartment room. You may guess what may have happened there. But when the movie reached the scene of the elevator, the movie went completely on a different path. I was watching the rest of the movie, and I really liked it. However, there are some low points... Some characters in the movie are completely silent! Take, for example, the mysterious man from the museum scene. I was always hoping that he could say something but he never did! This was totally ridiculous and was with no doubt something that made me change my mind by not accepting this movie as at least almost something as a masterpiece. Even in the cab scene, where Dickinson tries to apologize because of what happened in the museum, the completely silent man grabs her, pulls her inside the cab, and they start kissing each other. You know, it reminded me of the Mexican TV series of the 70's ""El Chavo Del 8"", where some characters are completely silent. Getting past these low points of the movie, it is actually a great movie, considering the suspense, the characters and the plot. Dennis Franz is cool as detective Marino! Reminded me of him as Capt. Carmine Lorenzo in Die Hard 2 (1990) where he plays almost the same kind of character. Well, concluding this review, the ending of Dressed To Kill is the same ending as it is in Carrie! I don't know if I really liked that, because I hate imitations! I understand that Carrie is a movie from DePalma, so it's not actually an imitation, because after all it was his idea! But it turned to be a repetitive idea in Dressed To Kill, so DePalma could have done something different instead of showing Nancy Allen waking up from a bad dream the same way it happens to Amy Irving at the ending scene of Carrie. This was, of course, with no doubt, another low point. But if you get past this, you will find that Dressed To Kill is a really good movie, and I assure you that it's not, by any means, a waste of time watching it.",Dressed to Kill
147,nickeyblack35,UNTIL THE SUBWAY SCENE,5,5 September 2020,"This movie was cool until they came to the stereotypical scene with 5 Black men ready to beat up a blonde hair white woman.

148,Movieguy-47,De Palma Faithfully Follows Hitchcock,9,29 July 1999,"Writer-director Brian De Palma is best known for his string of films that have been called, somewhat unfairly, ""Hitchcock imitations."" Contrary to popular belief, De Palma doesn't rip-off Hitchcock; he borrows story or character elements that may have been seen in a Hitchcock film and then expands on them in a more violent, modern way. Like Hitchcock, De Palma is known for mixing blood-soaked death with macabre humor.""Dressed to Kill,"" made way back in 1980, is, perhaps, De Palma's most well-known Hitchcockian film, and it's probably his best as well. The story involves a cross-dressing serial killer stalking both a burnt-out housewife (played by Angie Dickinson) and a street-wise hooker (played by Nancy Allen).Yes, it will remind you distinctly of ""Psycho,"" but De Palma's flick is just as technically ingenious and darkly creative. The museum sequence is particularly well-scored and edited; the elevator stab scene is also one of the most uniquely shot murders ever put on film. ""Dressed to Kill"" may not be a complete original, but I'd say it's definitely worth your time. Rated R. 105 minutes. 9 out of 10.",Dressed to Kill

Nancy Allen is just as great as the unapologetic prostitute who's comfortable in her skin and gets involved in a murder investigation after witnessing a murder and being named a suspect.",Dressed to Kill
150,grahamcarter-1,I need to discuss Dario Argento and Brian DePalma,8,12 May 2017,"Brian DePalma was born four days after Dario Argento on 11th September 1940, but they could have been separated at birth; and for those familiar with DePalma's work that would make you think of 'Sisters' (1973), a film that has a lot more to do with Hitchcock (an obvious influence on both their work), than with Argento in particular. The similarities come from an idiosyncratic assimilation of Hitchcock rather than from seeing and copying each other's work. Both directors like the 'Master' are relentless fetishists. I do find it hard to imagine DePalma's cinema without Argento's; 'Body Double' (1984), and 'Raising Cain' (1992) have grown out of 'Tenebre' (1982). Argento is a modernist rather than the more fashionable postmodern, and like Ingmar Bergman or John Ford he falls in and out of fashion with critics and the public. He has influenced his 'apprentices' Luigi Cozzi, Michele Soavi and Lamberto Bava; but he has also touched more celebrated filmmakers like John Carpenter (think 1978's 'Halloween'), Wes Craven, Takeshi Miike (Argento is 'big in Japan'), John Woo, David Fincher, and Spanish auteur Pedro Almodóvar. But with DePalma the influence runs a lot deeper even the word Doppelganger could be considered, but I'm not sure who you would point the finger at as being the unfortunate one. For all their similarities though, you can compare DePalma to Godard (most obviously with 'Greetings' (1968), and 'Hi, Mom!' (1970), and Godard has written of his admiration for DePalma's 'The Fury' 1978), whereas you can't easily compare Argento to Godard. It is helpful to think of DePalma as a jazz musician riffing on themes, his favourite pieces to riff on being 'Vertigo' and 'Psycho'. Familiar with 'Giallo,' he rarely cites them as influences (he claims to despise Argento's films). DePalma's dreamlike tangle of memory and desire owes less to Hitchcock than to the psychological 'Giallo' of Argento, and the baroque set pieces and sociopathic gender games of 'Dressed to Kill' and 'Body Double' scream Argento, but it's 'Raising Cain's' finale that completes the deal. A woman bends over to pick up her child, revealing the killer standing directly behind her, a scene straight out of 'Tenebrae'.'Dressed to Kill' could easily be described as a 'Giallo,' as DePalma pushes the boundaries of what is acceptable and in good taste (with mainstream cinema). 'Dressed To Kill' was a film that was released at the right time; post- Stonewall, post-feminist, post-disco, post-Son of Sam, pre-AIDS. However as controversial as DePalma wanted to be, 'Dressed to Kill' only has the whiff of cheap perfume compared to the pungent odor of its contemporaries of the grindhouse; William Lustig's 'Maniac' (1980), and Abel Ferrara's 'Ms. 45' (1981). Even another film from the big end of town, William Friedkin's 'Cruising' (1980), which DePalma had for a time been attached to was more controversial and sleazy; yet 'Dressed To Kill' shocked because more people saw it. DePalma uses paperback pulp psychology (pure 'Giallo'), to demonstrate that filmmaking is an inherently 'visual' storytelling medium. It is clear he is always more at home with scenes free of dialogue; the characters speak in pure soap opera exposition.The opening 'shower scene' establishes the theme; Kate is in the shower masturbating whilst watching probably her husband shaving; it's DePalma's 'thing', linking sexual stimulation to voyeurism. Hands clutch her from behind and she screams. Looking, pleasuring, violating. The sound design connects the next scene, where Kate is in bed moaning with 'ersatz' pleasure; talk radio dominates the soundtrack rather than a lush romantic musical score, and a high-angle shot fixes on the faceless husband and Kate's unfulfilled expression. Later, when she attempts to 'come on' to her shrink, the Doctor advises her to confront her husband about her anxieties. Before doing this, Kate visits the Metropolitan Museum of Art with nothing more on her mind than a shopping list (an inspired touch), and links up with a mysterious stranger. Following a hot and sweaty seduction in the back seat of a cab, she goes back to his apartment for a game of post-office. Immediately after, she is confronted by a mysterious blonde with a 'Giallo' like shiny straight razor. As Hitchcock had done audaciously in 'Psycho', DePalma does the unthinkable in the first act killing the woman we had assumed was the heroine. It's a dangerous trick, as the audience now has to reach out to new characters, Liz and Peter as the film starts again. Like Marcus in Argento's 'Deep Red', Liz (a prostitute, an outsider) must do the detective work.As with Argento, DePalma likes set-pieces featuring long takes with a mobile camera, and for DePalma in 'Dressed To Kill' it's the Metropolitan Museum of Art sequence. DePalma's obsessively moody overwrought sequence is a slice of the purest melodramatic overkill. DePalma's timing of Kate's impulses with the unreal ambiance and heightened emotion is overplayed to absurdity. Technically DePalma is as accomplished as ever.The Italian Argento, coming from a Catholic background, is at home with the torments of repression and guilt and the horrors they can produce. DePalma (from Newark with an Italian American Catholic background but attended Protestant and Quaker schools), embraces the hang-ups triggered by the liberation of a 'permissive' society. 'Dressed To Kill' celebrates the allure of perversion and desire, and the guilt that can create.The mistaken identity conceit is something DePalma had explored in 'Sisters' and 'Obsession' (1976), and would be revisited in 'Body Double' (1984), though all of this originates with Hitchcock's 'Vertigo' (1958). The cross- dressing and shower traumas are clearly from 'Psycho', as is the clinical explanation that ends proceedings. Always full of self-confidence, in the finale DePalma references 'Sisters' and the 'Carrie' (1976) dream and shock ending, it also hearkens back to the opening of 'Halloween' and prefigures its own parody, 'Blow Out' (1981).",Dressed to Kill
151,dperky,One of De Palma's Best,10,30 March 2019,"On the surface, Dressed To Kill might look like a cheap Psycho ripoff, but it has enough unique style to break away from Hitchcock and tell a much more modern story.To say too much of the plot would simply be rude as Dressed To Kill is best experienced completely cold. All I can say is that Michael Caine is the shrink to bored housewife Angie Dickinson who are both targets of a deranged, razor wielding psycho. Sassy hooker Nancy Allen joins in on the fun when she sees a murder she shouldn't have seen and no one will believe that she had nothing to do with it.Thanks to hazy, dreamlike photography, a solid cast, a tight script, and an eye from great compositions, Dressed To Kill is a thrilling, never-dull experience.",Dressed to Kill
152,yawael,"Sorry, But I Prefer The Fan 1981",4,18 December 2018,"The main reason that drove me to watch this film was the music score that was made by Pino Donaggio (the same guy who made the fan 1981 score: which was terrific by the way), knowing that it was a hit back then in 1980 (both financially and critically) and knowing that (Brian De Palma) directed it, I told myself that this must be something, but was it? Well it wasn't.Dressed to kill talks about a middle aged woman who killed by unknown women in the elevator and discovered by a young lady who saw the killer face (and the rest of the film is about attempting the killer reaching the witness to kill her). The idea sound familiar, to the horror fans, and that's because it takes the same elements of (psycho 1960), but making it different by changing the story line, so my first problem was that the film didn't bring anything new! (Just Adding some sexuality and unnecessary nudity)Another thing was showing the face of the killer, if you just took a close look at it, you will realize that it was her doctor wearing a wig (if they didn't show the face over and over again it would became a lot of surprising for the audience, even though I knew that he was the killer from the session at the early of the begging: when he looked at the mirror after her question he couldn't looked at her straight on the eye, which means he wasn't normal).The Best Thing was two scenes: the Elevator and museum they really were fabulous, fantastic and brilliant and must watched for their both brilliant score and cinema photography (other than this there is nothing special about it).

153,Movieman-133,Better than Psycho- much better.,8,21 June 1999,"Well,   there are some similarities between Psycho and Dressed To Kill but the scenes,   dialogue,  characters, music,  but the feel is almost completely different.  The characters do not act the same,  they do not encounter the same scenes or scenarios,   the music is more beautifully graceful with a score written by Pino Donnagio opposed to the much more aggressive scores by Bernard Hermann.  I am sure people can dig for similiarities but Psycho is extemely different than this film-except when the police sum up the crime.   The movie does contain two shower scenes but who ever made it official that every single time someone is taking a shower they are ripping it from Psycho--that's like saying everytime someone has sex or work in a kitchen or telephone booth they are copying it from a different place.    When I watched the opening shower scene and Angie Dickinson was washing herself--the film looked much more like it was Sissy Spacek taking a shower from Depalma's Carrie--not Hitchcock's Psycho. Another viewer wrote that the two shower scenes were pointless because they are just dream sequences--but dreams create imagery about the characters inner feelings,  fears,  thoughts,  and desires regarding to their real lives--and the scenes add suspense.  I watched the un-rated version and the main reason why it is unrated is because it shows Angie very naked in the beginning- everything else in the film is fine for an R rating.    Someone commented that gore and violence is like Friday the Thirteeneth when there was actually only one bloody spot,  and that wasn't even really graphic--maybe Psycho and this do have something in common because both seem to lie incredibly on suspense--at least this film got it right.  Some of the cinematography such as the museum sequence was excellently handled and Nancy Allen is funny,   sexy,  and really easy to like.  A split scene was used for no particular reason just to overwhelm the viewer into trying to listen to two conversations at once--  it seemes like Depalma added it just to experiment where in Carrie he used it to maximun advantage of horror.    Some really sexy and chilling scenes are when Nancy Allen is naked talking to the doctor trying to get his journal where lush strings create a mood of daring desire and a chase sequence where Nancy is running from subway guys and Bobbi.  Great acting overall and the music, cinematography, and mood was perfect for a movie that i'd consider a sexual thriller(not horror).",Dressed to Kill

I love DePalma films and think he does some of the coolest homages, especially the Battleship Potemkin moment in The Untouchables. I just didn't think this was one of his better films, though it was definitely worth watching and there were plenty of great moments in it. I might even watch it again eventually to revisit some of the scenes in it, and hey, maybe I'd even get DePalma's intent by viewing it a second time. Upon first viewing, I just don't feel Dressed to Kill amounted to much as a whole.",Dressed to Kill
157,meet_the_feebles,Dprseyscsheod Troip Koiflfl,5,29 December 2002,"Dressed to Kill has all the styling of a great thriller. It holds amazing artistic direction, and there are breathtaking, I mean absolutely amazing scenes where there is no dialogue. These scenes when the music and acting runs everything, something few directors could achieve, at least on this level. And the story isn't too bad either. Where dies Dress to Kill lose? It's a painfully obvious rip-off of Psycho. I know DePalma is aware, I've read reviews. But this is nothing like I thought. You could probably play them side by side and wonder why this wasn't thought of as an updated version of Hitchcocks ground breaking film.Beside the hack ending that goes beyond Psycho, there are other reasons why NOT to like this movie. The main one is the endless rip-off, it goes so far as to deal with the politics of film making. Hitchcock had to fight the censors for the shower scene in Psycho, a nude woman in a shower is very offensive. What does DePalma do? DePalma (probably trying to egg on the censors) has not only a naked woman but close up of certain parts. I'm not saying this is bad, but it shows the massive amount of detail that was put into the actual ripping-off of Psycho. Yes, if you've never seen Psycho or you have but you don't really pay attention to detail, then yes Dressed to Kill is a really good film. In fact for most people this is probably a great movie. But if you're a buff, an endless fan of film as I am. A person who lives to escape into the world styles of writers and directors, then Dressed to Kill will not cut, in fact it will only ANNOY it.

There really isn't any reason to see this film at all, because chances are, you've seen every single moment before in some other movie or TV show.  It's not poorly made, but it's nothing special either.The only sequence that had any magic at all was the museum scene, but De Palma ruined that by making it go on too long.I think the only thing noteworthy about this movie is that it probably has the most obvious body double ever seen in the history of film.

If you like movies that are more mystery than horror then rush out and buy this one right now and don't hesitate.  Forget about renting it because you will watch it over and over and over again.  The reason for this is because DePalma(my favorite director of all time) doesn't just play with your mind like Hitchcock did, he rapes it.  There are several scenes in this movie that Hitchcock would even of been proud of. The performances by all three main characters especially Michael Caine as a potential robot, he he you'll see, are all not great but fit just perfectly.  What works most for the movie is the scenes.  There are about four in it that are just as thrilling as the train station scene in The Untouchables.

160,Nefi,a truly great slasher piece,9,30 June 1999,"Dressed to Kill is one of my all-time favourites and it's easy to guess why. First, it's a homage to Psycho which is the one of the greatest films of all time. Second, it has one of the most beautiful original scores ever written for a film. Third, its director is the great Brian de Palma, in my opinion still the most underrated director of his generation. Although he was on a winning streak after the success of Carrie, his beautiful films began to be ripped apart by critics who couldn't differentiate between a rip-off and and a homage, thus paving the way for the bad reputation of his films which continue even today, the most striking example of which is the total critical (and commercial) failure of Snake Eyes. (In my opinion better than most of the films released last year) Dressed to Kill opens with a shower sequence that Hithcock would be proud to devise of. (If only censorship would allow him in those days.)Accompanied by Pino Donaggio's lush music, Angie Dickinson imagines her most violent fantasies become true which, later in the film,ironically will. The film moves from one stunning setpiece to another. The next one is an elongated dream-like chase through an Arts Museum. Depalma's use of split-screen in this sequence is incredible. The audience has totally identified with this middle-aged woman at this point and together with her,we desperately search for the man who made a pass at her through the long and endless corridors, only to be relieved when she finds him outside in a cab. The film is entirely dialogue-free for nearly 20 minutes and the enjoyment at a cinematic level is enormous. The murder sequence at the elevator therefore comes as a total shock, killing our heroine just as in Psycho (Hitchcock surely would have blessed DePalma for this alone) and turning the movie into a totally different direction. The remainder of the film is slasher piece of the highest order, including lots of trademark DePalma slow-motion, split-screen, amazing camerawork and a definitely breathtaking climax. It's a film to be seen again and again, each viewing giving purely cinematic fun. I highly recommend it to everyone bored with the teen-slasher pics drowning the market nowadays.",Dressed to Kill
161,ian_bell,Angie Dickinson in a slasher movie!,8,15 June 2010,"This is a glorious thriller, centred on Angie Dickinson - at least to begin with - a woman bored and frustrated by a largely dull marriage. She fantasises in the shower while watching her husband get ready for work, then recounts her problems to her psychiatrist.On visiting her psychiatrist (Michael Caine), who encourages her to give voice to her feelings, she ends up in an art gallery. Making eye contact with a man who sits next to her, she ends up following him round the gallery, before then being pursued by him. None of this is particularly relevant to the plot, yet oddly enough, is in fact far more compelling than the plot. There are numerous close-ups; Angie looking surprised, Angie looking shocked etc.It's all very glossily done, and very entertaining. But when she emerges outdoors everything turns, very briefly, into a sort of sex comedy.Lured into a waiting taxi by her mystery man, she duly gives in to his advances. For Dickinson, very nearly fifty, the scene is one which will have you either laughing or groaning. Losing her panties, she ends up on the floor of the taxi, hard at it while in full view of the cab driver. As her mystery man brings her to a fast and furious climax, she ends up having an orgasm so loud it drowns out the car horns in the traffic. It's a hoot.Later, in the man's apartment she wakes up and decides to make a quick exit while she can. But while dashing about stark naked, she can't find her panties (they are still in the taxi) before she then remembers she's left her wedding ring in her lover's bed (Whoops!). To top it all, she then finds out her mystery man may be carrying VD.As the film lurches into violent murder, which dominates the second half of the picture, the characters, as watchable as they are, simply fail to convince as much as Dickinson's. This dizzy blonde, eager to put some passion into her life, and then suddenly stunned at the price of her actions, is both compelling, funny, sexy, and totally sympathetic.For an actress about to hit fifty, I was intrigued as to why Angie Dickinson took the role. But then this is Hollywood. She was clearly ready to do the nudity - even going full frontal - and though the film does not quite match her talents, there is enough on show here (if you pardon the pun) to satisfy fans of both the slasher genre and those leaning to an earlier era of crime.",Dressed to Kill
162,Irecken,Very Good,7,10 November 2002,"This film is a fascinating mixture of Hitchcockian suspense and 80's splatter film gore. The performances are very good, especially by Nancy Allen, Michael Caine (as always) and Keith Gordon. There is a great deal of suspense, and the final twist is fantastic for its unexpectedness. Also, there are a few scenes which add a bit of welcome soap opera to the film. The only discordant notes are the excessive nudity, but what can one expect.",Dressed to Kill
163,fredk_us,Museum Sequence is Awesome; Puns abound in Film!,8,7 March 2007,"***SPOILERS ALERT***For all its sleaze, ""Dressed to Kill"" is one heck of a fascinating film, and De Palma pulled out all the stops.The museum sequence is one of my favorite passages in any film ever made. It ends with a hot taxi ride, but not before we see almost subliminal shots of the killer in the black trench coat outside the museum and who takes the second glove in extreme close-up when Kate gives up too soon the game. But let's rewind:As best as I recall: Kate Miller (Angie D.) walks around the NYC/Philadelphia museum dressed all in white, then sits to stare at the huge canvases in one room while getting ideas (""nuts"" from ""Reclining Nude,"" for example) for her shopping list. A little girl inches away from her parents and tries to run off and play, business as usual in an art museum.Then a man dressed all in black with sunglasses sits down next to Kate and that wonderful Pino Donaggio music begins, cellos cascading in unison, almost lamentingly so.De Palma wanted to do the gay underworld film, ""Cruising"" (which Friedken got), but this is one heck of a cruising sequence between a man and a woman! Kate is fidgety, turned on, sexually frustrated by her lackluster second husband, but she removes a glove and flashes her big diamond. The guy gets up and leaves, but then she gets up and swivels on her heels and unknowingly drops the glove to follow him. Not one word is ever spoken in this sequence.The mazelike camera work here is superb, very much as Alfred Hitchcock, with the many POV shots sliced between Kate's puzzled face and she tries to catch up with the man she now desires. The music is swirling and pounding and quite loud as Kate goes back to the first room to retrieve her lost glove. But it is gone! And so is the mysterious man, as Kate shrugs with great disappointment and the music ends on a large chord. I never tire of this scene.Outside, waiting for her, is her stranger waving her lost glove, beckoning her to join him for that cab ride!Another point:The man's apartment is stylish but filled with omens: the news magazine cover with a political cartoon and the words ""Teddy Chips Away;"" the canvas in the dim bedroom with its grotesquerie ""skull;"" the digital clock warning us that time is running out; Kate's pulling on her gold bracelets again, her chains, as it were, as her anonymous lover sleeps, who she will discover in a few moments in another, almost ear-splitting sequence, is hiding a secret in his drawers. Yes, puns abound in the film.And how awful for Kate when she enters the elevator, as guilt wells up in her from the staring girl, that she's forgotten her wedding ring at the man's apartment. Now Liz Blake (Nancy Allen, De Palma's wife) intersects with the story as does the killer, who has followed Kate, and lurks in a red-lit stairwell behind the door. The music will certainly change dramatically!Yes, it's sleazier than masterpiece ""Psycho"" but a satisfying film regardless. On US television, the film was edited, of course, and the horrifying murder is tempered by a red filter.",Dressed to Kill
164,rortrain,Brian De Palma's most effective and intense suspense film.,10,7 June 2012,"""Dressed to kill"" is by far my favorite Brian De Palma movie because it has superior suspenseful scenes than Blow out or Carrie. The visual is very important in this movie, it really tells a story by the images. The faces of the characters , their movements. It has a much more effective mysterious and menacing atmosphere than blow out. The music of Pino Donnagio gives tremendous power and energy to the images, a beautiful, scary and inspired composition. There are many mysterious characters in the movie. Michael Caine is very good, Angie Dickinson is expressive and touching and Dennis Franz is very funny (""What kind of place is this, everybody 's getting late after lunch"") and plays very well the inspector. This is the perfect late night horror movie. Brian De Palma did a very intelligent movie, the images are very intense, meaningful and he delivers the scares and tensions better than he has ever done.",Dressed to Kill

I can't believe that I hadn't ever seen it before. Actually, the only reason I even wanted to see it was because it was referenced in an episode of my favorite TV show, The Golden Girls. In that episode, Dorothy says to Blanche ""...this from a woman who tells her dates that she was Angie Dickinson's body double in 'Dressed To Kill."" So I was kinda curious to see this movie after that, however I was never very active about getting a copy of it until I stumbled across it on Blockbuster.com and ordered it immediately. I must say, this movie has a ton of sex appeal, even tho the cast members aren't too terribly sexy here. If you haven't seen this movie, I HIGHLY recommend it as it is probably one of the most intensely created movies I've ever seen.",Dressed to Kill
166,margielove,Sexy older woman,9,10 January 2016,"'Dressed to Kill' is a fascinating and entertaining film. It has to stand alone for having one of the sexiest scenes in cinema history - the taxi scene - where hardly any flesh is shown and all is imagined- unlike her 'wham-bam' dawn-breaker with her husband. Angie was nearly 50 years when she made DTK and it is testament to Brian de Palma that she wasn't thrown over for a younger model( esp. in 1980). The 'cat and mouse ' museum scene is riveting and interesting that her 'pick-ip' doesn't speak a word in the film - which seems to make him more alluring/desirable. The film has been alluded to having a Hitchcockian influence and the knife /wig are testament to that. But I would posit that the film has an Italianate influence ie agony and ecstasy intertwining. (comparable to the latter is 'Last Tango in Paris.')Examples are the early shower scene wherein Angie is blissfully soaping herself when an unknown man savagely takes her from behind. Note also in the murder/lift scene Angie's dress provocatively showing her legs when she is dying. The sub- plots of the son's scientific interests (pertinent to the film) and the call-girl's activities (Nancy Allen seems so believable that she could pass for the 'girl next door.') maintain the interest/momentum.I love the humorous asides eg Dtv. Marino:""What sort of a building is this? everyone getting laid after lunch!""Margaret Reines",Dressed to Kill
167,boutros2-508-493139,Message: Don't be a middle-aged woman looking for sex,3,25 September 2013,"If one thing is certain, Angie Dickinson didn't even have the acting chops to do bad porn. The opening shower scene was so awkward, voice overs, obvious body double and all, that it ended up being laughable. Brian De Palma is also to blame for that.But now that Ms. Dickinson's boobs and vagina have got your attention, there's some tedious cat and mousing through an art museum which culminates in our sexually frustrated, unhappily married old gal getting some from a handsome stranger in the back of a yellow cab and then in his nicely appointed penthouse apartment. Afterglow doesn't fully set in until she finds his membership card to an exclusive club while rummaging around for some paper to write him a little goodbye note of appreciation. Aawwww! :-) But, of course, a woman going after good sex and getting it has to pay the price. 1) She also finds a doctor's record showing that loverboy has contracted a venereal disease. 2) In her haste to leave her diseased lover's abode (I assume with the intention of running home and showering in bleach) she remembers that she left her wedding ring in his apartment. 3) On the return trip in the elevator, she is joined by a mother and little daughter. The daughter keeps staring at her because ...even small children know a freshly diseased whore when they see one? 4) She never makes it out of the elevator because she is then stabbed to death in the elevator by a tall blonde woman.Bear in mind that her dead body is to be found sans underpants (they were forgotten in the cab), no wedding ring, covered in blood and containing traces of diseased semen not belonging to her husband. If all this doesn't send every unfulfilled wife running back to the apathetic arms of their betrothed, I don't know what will.The rest of the movie is some half-baked nonsense about schizophrenic transexuality which is as equally grounded in maintaining the patriarchal status quo as this movie's take on women passed a certain age being sexual beings. There is also a splash of racism as a group of young (jive talking', of course) black men chase one of the main characters (a young, white prostitute) through a subway train with the intention of raping and beating her... just because. 3 stars for at least being stylish.",Dressed to Kill
168,Nihilon,Another Psycho rip-off,3,4 January 1999,"When Gus Van Sant did his Psycho remake, they said it was an original idea, had never been done before. Well it was done before and it was called Dressed to Kill. This movie takes so many elements of Psycho and shows just how bad a movie could be made of them. First you have the cross-dressing killer, but at least in Psycho the true sexual identity was kept secret til the end, but here it's no secret at all. There's the big-name actress who at first appears to be the main character of the film, and then is abruptly killed a third of the way into the film. There is even a long-winded psychological explanation of the killer's motives once he has been revealed, but here he is not just a transvestite, but a transsexual. Although he's really only a wanna-be transsexual, so really he's just a transvestite with a different motivation. The most pointless rip-off of Psycho here, though, are the two, count'em TWO, shower scenes that book-end the film. Neither comes close to Psycho's version, and even worse, they are both just dream sequences so they add nothing to the plot. The first one has nothing to do with the film whatsoever other than to show one of the film's stars nude. The second is even more pointless, coming after the killer's identity has been revealed. The only purpose I can think of is that they needed to make the film 10 or 15minutes longer to reach feature length, and tacked on this lame sequence as a result. This film is definitely not worth the time.",Dressed to Kill

Nancy Allen stars in one of her few good movies, the others being Robocop and Carrie.  This movie is definitely not for the squemish or those offended by sex and nudity, while the violence are by today's not to graphic, the sexual scenes are still very strong at least in the unrated version they are.Unrated:  some graphic violence, very strong sexuality and related dialogue, and for language.",Dressed to Kill

The story concerns a young computer nerd (Keith Gordon), a prostitute (Nancy Allen) and a cop (Dennis Farina) all searching for the identity of a mad transvestite slasher in Manhattan. Really the plot, as involving as it is, is really just an excuse to hang a number of truly impressive cinematic sequences; my favorite consists of several tracking shots depicting the flirtation and subsequent misunderstandings of one of the (female) main characters and a stranger she sees in a museum. There are just so many elements that are like candy to me: the fun ""Nancy Drew"" quality of the jaded prostitute and the nerd teaming up to solve the mystery, the humorously antagonistic relationship between the cop and the prostitute, the terrific suspense set pieces and just the overall trashy quality of it.

His films are violent and they do have nudity and sexuality but he does not use it just for the sake of having the kind of content he uses it in many ways like to explain something about A character or how much to characters feel about each other. but for some reason many people think this film is a Alfred Hitchcock rip of and to me that not true. Brian De Palma gave the film A style of its own that separate's the film for A Hitchcock thriller, like in the way he tells the story and the way the characters develops throughout the film. Dressed to kill has a wonderful cast with famous actors like Michael who gives A wonderful and memorable performance, And Angie Dickinson who is just wonderful in her role, I also love Nancy Allen in this film because She brings A feeling of realism to her character, I think everyone in the film brings the same feeling to me, Brian DE Palma has a style that to me completely separates him from Alfred Hitchcock.

The movie was beautifully shot  by De Palma in a very classical style influenced by ""Vertigo"" and ""Psycho"", but the screenplay is full of references to other filmmakers, basically Luis Buñuel and his ""Belle de jour"". ""Dressed to kill"" is a nice gore film with psycological ambitions and a very serious portrayal of a sadist killer called Bobbi, a transvestite or transexual man with problems of adaptation to  the society. The movie is a really horror tale of frustration with an incredible presence of erotism and an analysis of mental illness seen by the magician De Palma with their derivative imagination and their narrative talent. The main question of the film is the crazy character of Dr. Elliott/Bobbi perfomed by the eccentric Michael Caine and the others actors -Dickinson, Allen, Gordon and Dennis Franz- are involved in this brilliant erotic thriller. Bobby is back to remember to the audience that a transvestite is a paranoid person and the conservadurism of De palma is evident: nobody like him could be free in the streets.

Everything in that scene is great: camera work, acting, music, just flawless! It's as great as Argento's and ""Psycho's"" murder scenes. Yes, it's violent, but no one can deny the power of that moment.As always, another wonderful from De Palma's mind, this vastly underrated author, that deserves much more kudos than he has got.

After she is done with the meet she goes to an art gallery and hooks with a guy she likes. As they leave you can see a figure in a crowd of people in a black trench coat and sunglasses. At his place they sleep together but when she leaves she looks at his files and she realizes in horror he has a venereal disease! This scene takes you by shock and takes you full extent. She gets to an elevator and soon when the doors open the woman in the coat slashes her with a razor. She is in dread but she is trapped and the killer has forced her in. She slashes Dickinson across her torso and hands and face and the razor slits her throat.Nancy Allen is waiting for the elevator with a client and when it opens he sprints off in shock. But Allen goes to help Dickinson who is reaching for Allen. You see the killer in right by the doors. This is my favorite scene in the movie as you can see the killer and know that Allen is risking her life but you can't do anything to help. She can see the razor flash and pulls away seeing the figure in the mirror of the machine. The doors close and Nancy Allen grabs the razor that had been left. But now the killer gets a new victim to eliminate. After this the police suspect Allen but Dickinsons son investigates the killing and is able to save Allen when the razor wielding villain attacks her at a subway. Together they get a plan and suspect Caine. Allen seduces Caine and he leaves. She looks for Gordan outside the window but then the killer in the coat returns and tries to kill Allen but she is shot and the sunglasses and wig leave the body to reveal that Caine is the slaughterer! This is a perfect movie in my beliefs and I highly recommend this mystery horror!,Dressed to Kill
182,drmetal8,Yikes,1,30 June 2007,"I'm sad to say I finally saw this entire, uncut movie from start to finish. I had it for quite some time on DVD but never got around to watching it for one reason or another. I like to be positive and usually comment on movies I like, but wow....did this movie suck. I mean it truly sucked in every way. This is easily one of the worst movies I have ever seen. Some of the worst writing and acting of all time. I nearly cut it off after the first 20 minutes and boy, I wish I had. I'd really like to get that time back. It's not even one of those ""So bad it's good"" movies....it's just terrible. I won't even comment on the ""plot"" of this movie. (It's that bad.) Nor the attractiveness of the actresses in the movie (They are that bad.) Nor the direction. (It's bad.) Just avoid this like the plague. Or if you are a glutton for punishment, rent this and the Rick Springfield movie ""Hard To Hold"" for a nightmare double feature!!!",Dressed to Kill
183,kckrausebiz,DePalma & Caine are Genius! End of 70's cinema at its best!!,9,10 December 2015,"Get ready for an intense ride-an end of the 70's golden age of cinema style psycho-thriller! I first saw Dressed to Kill in my teens in the 80's and the story & visuals has stuck with me to this day. I am normally a non-fiction engineer numbers guy but appreciate 70's movies like this!The slow building tension is a visual-psychological feast that will suck you in! Watch with the lights low on a dark rainy night...The movie has such a great cast set in the days of the gritty yet refined but still only in NYC setting. Using the NYC setting as a great part of the tension which would not be believable in today's NYC...Caine, Allen and Dickinson are an incredible cast at the height of their dramatic acting skills.",Dressed to Kill
184,lenorediane-30044,Spoilers,1,26 October 2018,This was so predictable and frankly rather amateurish in style. It was below the fine actors involved IMO. It so easy to spot that we weren't looking at a women in the raincoat and sunglasses. And the shrink was the only one left with any interest to be her killer,Dressed to Kill
185,sthomas659,Dickinson shows she is an actor and still sexy at 49!,10,30 December 2003,The film gets my stamp of approval.  The scene in the museum demands acting without dialogue.  This is one of the most interesting and unique scenes in the history of film.  Dickinson's character Kate is very well developed and her performance is felt throughout the entire film.  The best work Angie Dickinson did since Point Blank!,Dressed to Kill
186,lostsoulsoflauadafilms,Safer than a sleeping pill. 😴,2,3 July 2019,"Seriously, I was almost lights out before the elevator scene. Unlike many other reviewers, I don't like to use the 'H' word when discussing DePalma's films. DePalma doesn't come close. And those of you who think that Nancy Allen was GOOD? She was DePalma's WIFE for chrissakes. In fact, I feel that the entire film was miscast. I liked ""Body Double"" much better.",Dressed to Kill
187,vla-85224,This movie aged very well,9,12 November 2021,"Don't worry about some of these feminists trying to cancel this movie because of nudity. They are just lonely with their only partner in life ..the dog.Now on to movie. It's exciting and unique film with some great music, cinematography, top acting and slow burn style storyline. This movie touches on some interesting topics and has very good dialogue. I first saw this movie as a 9 year old boy and asked my mom what "" syphilis"" means haha ( scene from a movie"". So do not watch this movie with kids around but as adult it's very entertaining and provocative. As a movie should. Movies must be provocative or they are not true to their art form. Highly recommend it's on HBO.",Dressed to Kill
188,glensibley,Wow,3,15 February 2002,"There are a few films that are so truly awful that they are extremely entertaining because of it. This film is Brian De Palma's bizarre tribute to the late great Alfred Hitchcock. This film is so badly miscast it makes 'Showgirls' almost look like and oscar film. I think my favourite scene is when Angie Dickinson sleeps with some guy she meets in an art gallery, only to find out he has got venereal disease, and then subsequently she gets murdered in a lift by a transsexual played by Michael Caine!
This film is a must for all of you who, like myself, thought that Pearl Harbour is the greatest comedy of all time. If your looking for cheap fun, you have to rent this movie now, it is a must you will kill yourself laughing from start to finish and also look out for the cheap Hitchcock rip-offs throughout, enjoy!",Dressed to Kill
189,hatchet39,Showers and Suspense,8,5 July 2011,"Never let it be said Bran De Palma can't direct. Okay sure, he has produced bad movies (Black Dahlia, Snake Eyes), but he has also directed underrated gems (Raising Cain, Body Double) and even, GASP!, good films. Dressed to Kill is one of those good films. No wait, its one of those films, the type of film that you'll be thinking about well after the credits. Why would you think of this film? Well the layman would say the Shower Scene, but I say its this one scene in an art museum with our protagonist Angie Dickinson. She's on a bench looking around the scene like a nervous grandmother (she was fifty at the time). Then she notices a man and nears him to get a closer look. He notices her and walks away. She keeps following and then he starts to follow her in a weird cat and mouse game. Why is the scene effective? Well, there's no suspense and no grand payoff; its just the look on Angie's face as she follows the man. Its a look of sadness as she slowly realizes that she is getting old and not as attractive anymore (not true). For all those who've seen the movie know that Angie dies a horrible death in an elevator. So why is she the protagonist? She's the first character we're introduced to and the story revolves around her. After her sad death, we are left with three characters: her son, an escort and her psychiatrist. Her son is a technical wizard who dabbles into voyeurism. I make it sound silly, but De Palma pulls it off along with the actor. Nancy Allen is the hooker who witnessed the crime and Michael Caine is Michael Caine playing Michael Caine. These three are finding the answers to Angie's murder. There's is also another scene I want to point out before I end this. Nancy is being chased by the killer in the subway. The suspense builds to the point where she can't see the killer anymore and relaxes. Unfourtanately, she ends up bothering a few men who try to rape her. Many of De Palma's detractors say he is to excessive in his films. This is true and this scene indicates that. Why did she have to be chased by the men? I don't know and I ended up laughing, but it got her on the train and she meets Angie's son and thats that. De Palma knows what he's doing.",Dressed to Kill
190,sylvrtortus,Dressed to Kill...My Patience,6,27 August 2013,"De Palma's incredible direction, Michael Caine's unfaltering excellence and a generous amount of gratuitous nudity are nowhere near enough to save this film. As always, the story is the problem. For a start, it is flipping ridiculous. In the name of creating drama the screenwriter writes the characters into a plethora of suspenseful situations, but in doing so completely jeopardises the apparent reality of the film. It's vital that the main characters in a thriller (who are not cops) face their problems without help from the police. The writer's job is to figure out clever ways to do this. Dressed to Kill is an example of exactly what NOT to do. Time and time again the main characters do not go to the police when any sane person would or alternatively the story puts their fingerprints on the killer's bloody knife to force their hand. The story ends up being WAY too forced and as a result it quickly becomes idiotic and any semblance of a dramatic reality soon falls away like a couple of articles of Meg Ryan's clothing.Unintentionally hilarious, convoluted, reprehensible, morally questionable, often boring and ultimately disappointing. This is no ""Untouchables"".",Dressed to Kill

193,jcsahli,Sex and Danger,10,6 November 2009,"Most people criticize DePalma's movies as simple vapid, sensationalistic trash with a highly developed cinematic sense. Few acknowledge, judgment in depth aside, what makes him truly worthwhile in the field of celluloid. Not only proves DePalma, in most of his films, to be an entertainer with a penchant for extreme violence, voyeuristic sexual overtones and enough baroque camp, but also a virtuosic master that out-Hitchcocks Hitchcock in the use of vicious audience manipulation for the sake of thrills, dread and edgy eroticism. His 1982 thriller ''Dressed to Kill'' is a visually entrancing and highly entertaining foray into spiky territory: the urban aura of deviance and perversion that jeopardize women as they follow their innocent, hermetic sexual desires.The first act of ''Dressed to Kill'' reads like a lavish and genuinely eerie Freudian nightmare, set against a silently menacing and sexually dynamic Big Apple. The film follows a day in the life of Kate Miller, this film's Marion Crane, a candent and well-kept housewife who is reaching a middle-life crisis and has the nagging conviction that there must be better sex out there. One sunny Manhattan morning to be spent in errands, she goes to the modern art museum with the hope that the visit will accompany in her aroused state of mind. One of the most perfect and stylish in the history of suspense, the museum sequence is a masterstroke of ascending sexual tension, distilled in subtle, sweeping gestures. It begins spatially unsettling, almost Antonioni-like, as our subject sits silently on a bench, almost crushed by the pressing stillness of the room as she gauges placidly at the paintings and the accompanied observers. That's until she notices a stranger in shades that exudes an eminent air of attraction and sexual advancement, and the scene takes a heart-thumping turn. The cat-and-mouse chase between Kate and the stranger, played against Pino Donaggio's lush score, is a masterpiece of staccato, deliberate pacing, breathtakingly orchestrated by DePalma's clinical, taut use of cinematography. One can almost feel Kate's excitement and horror at her new intrepidity and her internal tug-of-war as she searches the maze-like museum for signs of the elusive man. Her chic gloves become the ultimate ticket to an arousing yet lethal reality that takes her a bit too far from the repression and insecurity she has been feeling all this time.The brilliantly luring, suggestive first act and its set of perfectly choreographed scenes, filled with delicate visual technique that only accentuate the feeling of trepidation and a gory, misogynistic scene that still retains its visceral elegance, gives into a second act that plays like a typically svelte, agile-paced whodunit. DePalma's muse Nancy Allen is brilliantly effortless as Liz Blake, witness and prime supect and a frivolous, easygoing call girl with a street-smart sense of humor who is the opposite of Kate Miller,seeing sex as a mere transaction and being effortlessly adapted and knowing of the deviance and violence that lies within the big city. She makes a generation-gaping and curiously endearing team with Peter (Keith Gordon), Kate's science whiz son, who helps her lead their own investigation into the identity of the transsexual who brutally murdered Kate. Again De Palma seems to better Hitchcock in the handling of suspense scenes that avoid the typically weighty, macabre execution proper to some giallos, to focus on an urban dynamism that is more rousing than menacing, and that adds a sprightly, gossamer feel that in scenes like the subway one, proves to be also thrilling and masterfully effective.The killer is not the stereotypical lurker but an easily noticeable one, making him have a proximity to the audience that has more the vertiginous feel of an ongoing chase than the unexpected assault of the masked murdered. Although undoubtedly the film develops into something more vi brant, Brian de Palma's neo-Hitchcockian vanguard never loses its guard,using numerous split screens, mirror reflections and other voyeuristic tricks to install an intoxicating sense of danger in the gliding life of Liz. The identity of the killer, although not that surprising, is supervised with expert precision by DePalma, only letting the vague assumptions culminate in a final resolution that is a staggering proof of his technical virtuoso. Began as a hypnotic spellbinder of a first act and continued as a whimsical action thriller of a second one, the film's true nucleus resides, however, in the first half. Kate's sadomasochistic dream in the film's very beginning plays like a romantic reminder that even the most forbidden, dangerous and arousing of sexual fantasies and desires have a greater vulnerability amongst the shiny surfaces of New York City, and its corners filled with psychos, degenerates and unprotected men. Her fatal mistake was not only to trust too much in the men around her but of believing she would find the mysterious, sadistic hunk of her dream somewhere in the journey. Ultimately that idealized hunk is in reality someone that resides in the much sordid, confounded level of sexuality and whose murdering instinct not only fulfilled Kate's fantasy but ultimately, as the final scene proves, touched another woman who thought she was shielded from the danger of sex.",Dressed to Kill
194,alanmaltby,Still great after 20 years,10,30 November 2002,"I first saw this film at the cinema when it was first released and having just seen it again on TV 20 years later, I had forgotten what a powerful and great piece of film making this was. From the opening scene panning round the house to the shower with that great haunting music is fantastic and the whole of that now 'infamous' shower scene with Angie Dickinson is pure magic. The film's next great point is what i consider to be one of the best pieces of filmmaking ever - the museum. No dialogue, some music, great camera work and excellent acting from Angie Dickinson without even saying one line. This scene is so clever, it has you on the edge of your seat, willing her to make contact with the mysterious stranger. SPOILERS AHEAD - Then Brian de Palma does something to his audience which quite frankly blew my socks off - he kills off the main character one third into the film. I must admit, watching this again I was taken aback that Angie Dickinson was written out so early, but now realise that this was a master stoke as it is totally unexpected and has more impact than say a stranger getting murdered early on in the film. With Ms Dickinson gone, it's up to Nancy Allen to take over the main female lead. A great actress she is not - but does her best with the script she is given. The film starts to race away with its twist's and turns and when the finale comes and the killer is revealed, we are then treated to one last truly shocking scene. Thoughts of my cinema visit came flooding back with that one last shocker. I would like to point out that in response to so many other comments on this site, I did not for one moment think that this film was a ripoff of Psycho or in fact any other Hitchcock film - you could say that about any slasher thriller. I still think that this film was gravely underated when it was released and can only hope that now (especially with the DVD release) that this will now be seen and appreciated as one of the great films of the early 80's.",Dressed to Kill

196,livk511,Bet it looked good on paper,1,27 February 2006,"I can find very little thats good to say about this film. I am sure the idea and script looked good on paper but the filmography and acting I am afraid is not the standards I would expect from some very talented people. I would doubt that this features highly in their CV Filmography. Michael Caine appeared wooden at times in his role as the Doctor, and at no time no did I actually believe in his character. The plot was unbelievable especially with regard to the victims son. Some of the scenes were very reminiscent of other films, that at times I wondered if it was actually a spoof thriller. The lighting at times was dark and this added to the feeling of watching a low budget movie with some big named stars, wondering why I bothered to watch it at all.",Dressed to Kill
