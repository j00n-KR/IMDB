0,MartinHafer,Pretty much everyone but the two directors hate this film.,1,9 August 2018,"Why would I choose to watch ""Super Mario Bros."" when it was a critical and financial bomb? Well, IMDB recently changed their criteria for films to make their infamous Bottom 100 list and now this film is officially on it...at #96. And, since I have long been trying to see every Bottom 100 movie, I have a bunch of new pictures to watch and review.It's interesting when you read through IMDB's trivia about this movie. Apparently everyone connected with it except for the two directors hated it and hated making this film. I could only assume that I would hate it as well.Well, I did hate the film...for many reasons. Much of the problem is the plot. It often makes no sense (such as minions suddenly switching sides for no apparent reason), the dialog is among the dumbest I can recall in a film and the story is not at all the sort of thing I'd want young kids to watch...which is odd, since it's based on a kids' game! The plot, if anyone really cares is about Koopa (Dennis Hopper), a reptile who has used his evolving/devolving machine to make himself and many of his subjects in a parallel world look human. His goal is to capture Princess Daisy and use a meteorite shard to merge the two worlds and become dictator of both---though exactly how doesn't seem to have been worked out by Koopa. As for the brothers, they fall into the parallel world and battle Koopa to save the worlds.If I were describe the film in one word, it would not be terrible but TIRESOME. The film is dull, uninvolving and a bit stupid. I would NOT place it, however, on the Bottom 100...as there are many worse films which will never make the list because they were NOT made in the last 30 years--and the list is heavily weighted towards this. ""Santa Claus Conquers the Martians"", ""Robot Monster"", ALL of Al Adamson's and William Grefe's films and the terrible exploitation films of the 1930s and 40s (such as ""Sex Madness"" and ""Reefer Madness"") aren't even on the list--and these films are all, amazingly enough, worse than ""Super Mario Bros."" but were made during an era that has almost no representation on the list...not that this is a glowing endorsement! Would I put it on a Bottom 200 (if such a list existed)...easily!",Super Mario Bros.
1,TheLittleSongbird,Nowhere near the thrill-ride that it could have been,4,29 June 2016,"The Super Mario Brothers games are still great fun. Admittedly they are light on plot, almost simplistic, but they are imaginative, lots of fun and thrilling with memorable characters and interaction.'Super Mario Bros' did have a good deal of potential, with talented actors like Bob Hoskins, Fiona Shaw, Samantha Mathis and Dennis Hopper on board, and it was always going to be interesting to see whether the film would be able to make an interesting story that didn't have a huge amount of narrative material to work from. Unfortunately, it is a real let down, and was doomed from the start from trying to do too much and from its notoriously troubled behind-the-scenes.Video game/interactive film adaptations have a very dubious record, always giving a sense that video/interactive games don't translate well to film, and 'Super Mario Bros' is not an exception. This said, in general there are far worse films out there, while it misses more than it hits 'Super Mario Bros' has a few good spots. Some of the photography is good. Bob Hoskins and John Leguizamo do their best in the lead roles and both do a more than respectable job especially Hoskins. Their chemistry and rapport is enjoyable if at times rather too father and son than brothers. Alan Silvestri's score while in want of more recognisable themes for fans is well-suited for the film and has a nice rousing energy, atmosphere and whimsy. Good song choices too.However, 'Super Mario Bros' has several problems that stop it from being the thrill ride it could have been. The rest of the cast don't really impress that much. Dennis Hopper is always a great pleasure in over-the-top roles, particularly villain ones and when he loses it, and on paper he did seem an ideal choice. The thing is though with a role like Frank Booth in 'Blue Velvet', Hopper was not only over-the-top but also terrifying and the character was interesting, here in 'Super Mario Bros' as King Koopa Hopper is a large piece of unsubtle ham and that's it and there are some points where he's almost subdued, sometimes you expect Hopper to lose his rag and it doesn't really happen. His dialogue also further dumbs down the character, making King Koopa very much a missed opportunity as a villain. Samantha Mathis has some moments of heart and charm but is pretty bland on the whole, while Fiona Shaw at times comes close to out-hamming Hopper. The Goombas are sometimes sort of fun, but sometimes pointless and too goofy.It is a shame really that the film's production troubles come through loud and clear in the film itself. The direction has a very inexperienced and erratic feel, and like the directors had no idea what to do with the film. The same is with the story, granted credit is due for trying to do something with source material that doesn't give them an awful lot to work with and it's very energetic in pace and never dull. Unfortunately, there is the sense that the writers didn't know which direction to go or how to start, with target demographic/audience and what it wanted to be never really clear (despite also being a bad film with many huge problems, 'Street Fighter' at least got that right). 'Super Mario Bros' constantly feels rushed, bloated, over-complicated and like there was too much going on, and further sadly not all of it was necessary or made sense as a result of not being explored enough. Exposition is also garbled, so that it has nothing to do with the games other than a few clumsily inserted references which reeked of trying to squeeze them in when this fact was realised in production.As well as lacking in thrills, as a result of the over-crowded and over-complicated story, there is a lack of fun and imagination. The jokes are too juvenile and too embarrassingly awkward to be any fun, and only succeeds in dumbing down so many of the characters (a huge part as to why King Koopa is lacking as a villain). In fact, the script generally was poor, with childish and sometimes misplaced humour and dialogue that clunks badly. Action is very jagged and stop-start. Apart from in the photography and in a couple of neat effects, the expensive for back then budget is not hugely obvious in the production values, where interference and production troubles are second most obvious after the story. The sets are cluttered, too small in scale and quite drab and lacking in colour or dazzle, the world is never fully immersed and others have said it looks like a cheaper and dumbed down 'Blade Runner' which this reviewer agrees with. A lot of the effects are slapdash even for the early pre-'Jurassic Park' 90s.Overall, has some good assets but, while it is not as horrendous as the universal critical and commercial failure on release and as its reputation suggests, too much of it is lacking for it to be the thrill-ride it had the potential of being with the right execution. 4/10 Bethany Cox",Super Mario Bros.
2,Horst_In_Translation,Not even close,4,18 November 2017,"""Super Mario Bros."" is an American 100-minute movie from 1993, so this one will have its 25th anniversary next year. For Jankel and Morton, the two English Emmy-winning directors, this is certainly still their most known work a of today, but that really has to do with the epicness of the characters, not because it was a good movie by any means, but because absolutely everybody knows Super Mario and Luigi from the video games. And that includes me as well as I grew up with this series too. That's why it makes me even sadder that, despite the inclusion of some quality actors, the outcome here was this underwhelming. Honestly, I did not get the Mario vibe at all and to me it did not feel like a Super Mario movie. The red and green costumes as well as the protagonists being plumbers is just not enough, just like the use of the names of the characters like Mario, Luigi, King Koopa and Daisy with the latter two apparently still being more known names back then than Bowser and Peach. Anyway, that of course is not the problem here I think. The real problem is that the attention to detail that really could have been key here was so minimal. The smaller references about the video game (bombs, mushrooms...) were not on a level that could satisfy video game fans sadly. And the negatively deal-breaker consequence is that it just never felt like Mario ever. It was a fantasy film, but not a particularly good one as it also did not succeed in its own right.It also felt really generic in my opinion, for example with the relationship between Luigi and Daisy. That felt really forced to give the film some dramatic and romantic relevance that it certainly did not need. This should have been a pointless fun movie to be honest. Of course, this project as a whole was a huge challenge given the base material here, but it is kinda shocking to see that there were a pretty large amount of three writers working on the adaptation and it became such a mess. At least it is not a complete failure really as here and there, there was an okay moment. But these were clearly in the minority. What stays far more memorable here is the weak unfortunately. For example regardless of what you think about Dennis Hopper as an actor, he never felt like Bowser one bit. Not at all. I personally also did not like Yoshi's looks, but in contrast to Hopper, who was never on a level to feel like a top-notch antagonist, I'd say this is more of a subjective perception. The bar was definitely too high here and I am not too surprised no other filmmakers showed any ambition to take on the story of Mario and the gang. These days, a film like that may be career-ending Razzie material. Okay what else is there to say. I guess the filmmakers did not think this would bomb that hard and get such a high percentage of negative reviews as the ending looked like they certainly had plans to make a sequel, but of course it never happened. Finally, about this one here again: It is not Mario to me and it could have been way better. It is a forgettable fantasy film instead and I give it a thumbs-down. Don't watch.",Super Mario Bros.
3,kosmasp,Not so super,3,9 June 2020,"This is quite the head on crash you might witness here. Why anyone thought this was a good idea is beyond me. Of course having those names involved might have made some believe there is something here. Dennis Hopper and Bob Hoskins .. you'd be excused to think there is something here. And I guess there is. For some it may be a mystery how this might not get the similar attention that Troll 2 or The Room got.However you feel, this has not aged well. Though I don't think most of the jokes worked back then either. It has a well meaning heart and it does try hard with some quirky sentiments. Just for that alone, I would like to give it a pass. But I just can't, it would not be fair to other movies who have done it better ... or to those I rated low because of the missing quality. It's infamous alright and maybe one prime example how not to do video game movies ...",Super Mario Bros.
4,Sleepin_Dragon,"Corny as Hell, but fun.",7,14 November 2020,"This is one of those movies I loved as a thirteen year old, I remember seeing it a few times. It was a film naturally aimed at my age group in 1993, I wish people would remember that when writing up such serious reviews. It's quite a fun story, the special effects are probably a little naff thirty years later, but what do you expect? Bob Hoskins is good fun.I'm surprised by just how dark the story is, funny how you have a different look on things when you're young.What I found interesting, was the theme music, Almost Unreal by Roxette, what an awesome track, arguably the best aspect of the film.Fun, 7/10.",Super Mario Bros.
5,gavin6942,Every Bit As Bad As People Say,4,28 September 2014,"The Mario Brothers rush to save a princess (Samantha Mathis) from Koopa (Dennis Hopper).This movie bombed at the box office, losing $20 million. Critics did not like it, fans apparently were not thrilled (not even Mario-loving kids could fill the seats enough to break even). This reviewer saw the film when it came out on video and was not thrilled.Twenty years later (2014), I have revisited the legendary flop. Age has not improved it, not one bit. Had this script been written from scratch without being very, very loosely based on a game, it might now be considered a cult classic. In all fairness, there were some clever ideas and the effects are not bad by 1993 standards.The problem, of course, is that the source material is a game, but the fans of the game will find little to appreciate here. The movie was not geared towards kids, did not incorporate the game's music, kept almost none of the plot. If this was not appealing to fans of the source material, who was it meant to please?",Super Mario Bros.
6,lee_eisenberg,better than you might expect,6,17 May 2006,"Nowadays, when we think of movies based on video games, we think of garbage. As ""Super Mario Bros."" shows, it wasn't always like that. This movie isn't great, but not bad by any stretch. Part of what makes the movie so neat is Dennis Hopper's characterization of Koopa; I liked his comment about mud.It's weird to think that when ""SMB"" came out, I'd never heard of John Leguizamo (he plays Luigi). He's since done quite well in many roles. And Bob Hoskins also does quite well as Mario. It seems like they could have developed Daisy (Samantha Mathis) a little further. But overall, this flick's a pretty enjoyable romp.",Super Mario Bros.
7,jboothmillard,Super Mario Bros.,4,21 September 2005,"This was probably the first film I had ever seen based on a popular video game, and naturally I followed it with things like Resident Evil, Lara Croft: Tomb Raider and Mortal Kombat, and having played it myself I hoped the movie about the famous brothers would be good fun. Basically the Italian American brothers, Mario Mario (Bob Hoskins) and Luigi Mario (John Leguizamo) are plumbers in Brooklyn, New York, but they can't get much work with Scapelli Construction Company, run by Anthony Scapelli (Gianni Russo). Luigi meets and falls for orphaned paleontology student Daisy (Samantha Mathis), but before they can really get to know each other she gets kidnapped by strange cousins Iggy (Fisher Stevens) and Spike (Richard Edson) and taken to another dimension. Millions of years ago when the dinosaurs were supposedly killed by the meteor that hit Earth, in fact this meteor blasted the universe and created this alternative dimension where dinosaurs still exist, many evolved into looking like humans, and this world is run by corrupt and nasty King Koopa (Dennis Hopper). He plans to merge the two worlds together by the use of the small chip of the meteor that Daisy wears around her neck, but Mario and Luigi have followed them to get her back. As time goes by, and they try to escape the Jurassic and cretaceous creatures chasing them, such as the Goombas, the brothers are not just trying to save Daisy, but they also find that they may have to save the world as well. Koopa does get his hands on Daisy, and eventually the rock, but with their skills in plumbing handy, as well some gadgets and unlikely friends along the way, including the fungus that covers the city, the Mario brothers do save the day. Also starring Harry Potter's Fiona Shaw as Lena, Dana Kaminski as Daniella, Mojo Nixon as Toad, Lance Henriksen as The King and John Fifer as Goomba Toad. Hoskins makes a good grouchy and often sarcastic Mario, and Leguizamo is likable as the younger brother (but no moustache?), and even though it is strange to see an actor of his talent in a film like this Hopper is okay as the obsessive villain who wants to take over the world. There are elements and references to the games, such as the blue and red and blue and green costumes for the brothers, the large mushrooms and inventive dinosaur creatures, but that it is really all, the rest is a slight let down, as a video game adaptation anyway, but for the silly attempted action and comedy (some of the laughs unintentional), it isn't a terrible fantasy adventure. Okay!",Super Mario Bros.
8,ccthemovieman-1,The Good & Bad Of 'Super Mario Brothers',6,20 August 2006,"Here's a kid's movie, at least with the title, but is really for both adults and kids:THE GOOD - (1) It's fairly entertaining even for adults; (2) it has some likable characters, especially ""Luigi Mario"" (John Luguizamo); (3) it has almost no profanity or blasphemy; (4) some of the special-effects are fun to view and humorous.THE BAD - (1) The story is very stupid; (2) it gives yet another plug for evolution, something Godless Hollywood is u-relenting in pushing on everyone; (3) bob Hoskins, as the lead character ""Mario,"" is too loud and abrasive.Other notes: Dennis Hopper does a nice job of restraining himself! Usually he plays a whacked-out character. Samantha Mathis is a pretty new face.Overall: better than anticipated; worth a rental.",Super Mario Bros.
9,BandSAboutMovies,Better than its rep.,7,2 February 2018,"My wife has never played Super Mario Brothers. She first saw this film at the now Hollywood Theater in Dormont as a child and it became one of the many films she rewatched over and over again as she grew up.I've never seen the movie Super Mario Brothers, but the Mario character was a big part of my childhood and I played every one of his games as I grew up.Together, we watched the film and came at it from two very different perspectives. Imagine, if you will, someone who has no bias toward this movie for how different it is from the property that inspired it and only sees it as a film about two adopted plumber brothers battling a parallel world ruled by dinosaurs.When seen through those eyes, perhaps Super Mario Brothers is a good movie. To everyone else, it's either a movie they hate - like lead actor Bob Hoskins - or one they can't even begin to understand.Producer Roland Joffé pitched the film to Nintendo, telling them that they'd have more control over the film working with his small Lightmotive company. Draft after draft of the film was made with Harold Ramis being considered as the director. Finally, the husband and wife team of Rocky Morton and Annabel Jankel (who created Max Headroom) were selected.At that point, they jettisoned everything that came before. The original script, by Jim Jennewein and Tom S. Parker, was a more fairy tale retelling of the plot of the video games. Instead, the new directors wanted the film set in Dinohatten, a dark alternate version of New York City where dinosaurs ruled. Here's the first issue - this world appears nowhere in the universe of the Super Mario Brothers games. The team wanted a dark satire instead of a bright, colorful world. Amazingly, they convinced the producers and Nintendo to go along with their vision.Over the next year, five scripts were written by nine writers. Sets were built and scripts were even written without the directors being on board that tried to soften their narrative ideas and make a more kid-friendly film. That said - the sets had already been built.None of the original script remained when filming started. The principal actors, Bob Hoskins as Mario and John Leguizamo as Luigi, began drinking through much of the filming. This led to an incident where Leguizamo crashed the plumbing van and broke Hoskins' hand (he wore a flesh-colored cast for the rest of the production). Dennis Hopper, playing the lead villain Koopa, had open contempt for the directors, seeing them as control freaks.Yet there was a great early buzz for the film, with an L.A. Times article comparing the set design favorably to Blade Runner (they share production designer David L. Snyder). Then Disney bought on to the film. And then the directors were shut out of reshoots and lost their final cut.Everyone believed that kids would love the movie. Mario was such a big deal to them, this was a can't miss bet. Kids will watch anything, right? Even if what they come to see has nothing in common with the video games and cartoons and the actual property that they loved so much, right?Let's get into it. The film starts with a poorly animated retelling of how the dinosaurs died off. I'm not sure if this is supposed to look like a video game or have been created in Mario Paint, but with the budget of the film, it sure feels weird. We learn that the meteorite that crashed into Earth made another dimension where dinosaurs rules.In present day New York City, Mario and Luigi are struggling plumbers who are getting put out of business by the Scapelli Company. Those guys are also messing with an NYU sponsored dig where dinosaur bones are found under the Brooklyn Bridge by an orphaned archaeology student named Daisy (Samantha Mathis, Pump Up the Volume). While on a date, the villainous Iggy and Spike (Fisher Stevens from Short Circuit and character actor Richard Edson, who was also Sonic Youth's original drummer) kidnap Daisy and take her to the dinosaur dimension.This leads to King Koopa (Hopper) and his minions trying to get both Daisy and her necklace so that they can take over our world. Daisy ends up being the princess of the other side, with her father being devolved into a fungus (he's played by an unrecognizable Lance Henriksen).Along the way, Spike and Iggy realize that their cousin Koppa is evil and help the Mario brothers, all while Daisy meets Yoshi and Toad (Mojo Nixon!) is introduced as a musician who writes anti-Koopa music before being devolved into a Goomba. And Fiona Shaw shows up as Koopa's would-be love interest who really wants to show him up by enacting his plans.The two worlds become merged, with Koopa devolving the owner of the Scapelli Corporation into a monkey before Mario attacks him with a Bob-omb (one of the few video game references that happen in the film). Koopa then becomes a human Tyrannosaurus Rex before getting filly devolved into slime and Daisy's father being saved. Whew!Luigi tells Daisy he loves her (you know, Mario's usual role) but she can't leave her home behind. But weeks later, she returns, dressed as a warrior and asking them to return.Want an example of how weird the film is? Hoskins didn't even realize he was working on a video game adaption until his son asked him what he was working on. When he told him the title, he showed his dad the game on his Nintendo.Here's another father and son story: when asked why he did the film by his son, Dennis Hopper replied, ""So you can have shoes."" His son replied, ""Dad, I don't need shoes that badly.""Hoskins further described the shooting of the film in a 2011 interview with The Guardian: ""It was a fuckin' nightmare. The whole experience was a nightmare. It had a husband-and-wife team directing, whose arrogance had been mistaken for talent. After so many weeks their own agent told them to get off the set! Fuckin' nightmare. Fuckin' idiots."" In that same interview, he also used the movie as the answer to the questions ""What is the worst job you've done?"", ""What has been your biggest disappointment?"", and ""If you could edit your past, what would you change?""Ryan Hoss, the webmaster of the Super Mario Brothers Movie Archive, says that the end result of the film is, for some, ""an interesting, unusual, entertaining, compelling, and inspired look into this fantastical world. Others have had a hard time accepting the way the 8 and 16-bit games were adapted onto celluloid, calling the movie a complete disaster and disgrace to the video games. The goal of this website is to help its visitors better understand an often misunderstood film. What the filmmakers were trying to do with this movie had never been done before, so we think it's important to appreciate the immense amount of thought and respect that went into creating the final product. In the end, the filmmakers did something wildly revolutionary-by making the first ever theatrical feature based on a video game property.""We'll talk to Ryan this week and learn more about how his site was created and how he was able to transform so many people's love for this film into a blu-ray release.As for my take on the film, I think I'd love it if I saw the film like Becca, as a youngster with no idea who any of the characters were supposed to be, just ready to enjoy a world where two plumbers battled evil dinosaurs. Perhaps if we all see it that way, the film is a little but better.",Super Mario Bros.
10,Bunuel1976,"SUPER MARIO BROS. (Annabel Jenkel, Rocky Morton and, uncredited, Roland Joffe' and Dean Semler, 1993) **",4,17 September 2010,"The film version of Nintendo's SUPER MARIO BROS. is mainly notable for two things: being the very first Hollywood production ever to be based on a video game (and the most popular one of its time at that – one I have been aware of from TV spots but have never played) and being unanimously deemed a complete disaster i.e. by movie critics, fans, Nintendo itself and even the film's stars. In fact, leading man Bob Hoskins (replacing Danny DeVito and Dustin Hoffman!) was allegedly drunk throughout the shooting and considers the film to be his worst!Speaking of replacements, Harold Ramis was initially considered for director and Kevin Costner turned down the role of chief villain King Koopaa combination which could hardly have improved things much in my view. Somewhat incredibly, the film also boasts among its various producers Roland Joffe' – the award-winning film-maker behind THE KILLING FIELDS (1984) and THE MISSION (1986) – who, allegedly, also had a hand in the directorial chores on this evidently troubled 'blockbuster'.In any case, cinematic transpositions of video games are certainly here to stay as the latest one (a full 17 years later), PRINCE OF PERSIA: THE SANDS OF TIME (2010), clearly attests. Having watched it for myself, I can safely say that it was not as bad as its unenviable reputation would have you believe; in fact, it brought back fond memories of my childhood viewings of equally exotic (and maligned) adventure fare as HOWARD THE DUCK and THE GOLDEN CHILD (both 1986). Among its relative assets is the gaudy BLADE RUNNER-meets-BRAZIL look for the parallel world of the dinosaurs that seems to be a remnant of the cult MAX HEADROOM (1985) Sci-Fi TV-series created by the film's official directorial duo; I also like the main females in the cast, namely the blonde heroine Samantha Mathis and the red-headed villainess Fiona Shaw.Going to the debit side, one has to point out Dennis Hopper's embarrassingly spiked hairdo, the silly sidekick villain duo who, even after being turned geniuses by their boss, still act dumb and, bafflingly, turn heroic! Ultimately, the film plunges to the depths of irreparable silliness during the sequences depicting Hopper's dinosaur Goombah henchman dancing to Maurice Jarre's ""Somewhere, My Love"" aka ""Lara's Theme"" from David Lean's DOCTOR ZHIVAGO (1965)!!",Super Mario Bros.
11,Boba_Fett1138,Certainly better than its current reputation.,6,11 April 2006,"This movie is much hated practically everywhere and of course I can understand why. Basically everyone from the '70's , 80's and 90's generation grew up with playing Nintendo games and the Super Mario games in particular. However when one sees this movie, it becomes pretty obvious early on that this movie has almost nothing to do with the Super Mario video games. The atmosphere, settings and characters are totally different, which is probably the main and also only reason why this movie was and still is hated among so many all over the world.However, when one has to look at this movie with a fair and unbiased view, one has to come to the conclusion that this movie is good decent entertainment. No, it's not a GREAT movie but it does serve its purpose and that is to provide the viewer with 104 minutes of mindless, simple entertainment.Kids will most likely like this movie best. The story is wonderfully adventurous and it all is very childishly simple constructed. I mean, the story and setting all basically have very little to do with the games but when you just have to judge the story, it's a pretty good and well thought out one. If the main characters were, let's say, some average Manhattan plumbers named the William's brothers and the entire movie wasn't based on a series of video games, than perhaps the movie would had received a far better reception and would had entertained and reached a wider audience.All of the characters are pretty entertaining and work out well in the movie. This is probably mainly due to the well known cast. Bob Hoskins and John Leguizamo are the Mario brothers and they form a pretty good main duo. Dennis Hopper also is in his element as the ruthless, over-the-top, stereotyped villain King Koopa. He gives the movie a certain extra fun and flair. Other well known actors in the movie are Fiona Shaw, Gianni Russo (Carlo Rizzi from the first two The Godfather movies) and Lance Henriksen in a very small cameo role.Unlike the games, the movie is a dark one. All of the sets are dark which was perhaps not the greatest atmospheric mood for the story and the entire movie in general. All of the sets are disappointing, small and unimaginative looking. Same goes for the costumes and most of the make-up effects. The movie however has some good and convincing looking early special effects. Remember folks, that it was 1993 when this movie was released.The movie however is most of the time a bit too childishly told and the dialogs are below par and too simple.The pace and editing is good but the movie severely lacks some action and real interesting moments. At moments it takes too long before something good or interesting happens again, which makes this movie perhaps a bit boring and uninteresting to watch at certain points.All in all it's a not very successful- but still yet entertaining first attempt at making a movie based on a video game. Certainly better than some of those movies based on video games, released this present day!6/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",Super Mario Bros.
12,Aaron1375,The directors' vision of Mario and Luigi? Mad Max meets Alien From L.A.!,2,2 June 2020,"I see a lot of people defending this movie, acting as if the directors who made this had sense, but seriously, movies are made to make money not impress hipsters years later. In 1993, the only people that would have been excited for a Mario film are kids and a few teens and none of them would have wanted a dark drama about the relationship between the two brothers set in an almost Mad Max meets Alien From L.A. movie. The directors made horrible choices, but I cannot fault them entirely as the studio picked this husband/wife team at the time to direct this and their main achievement was Max Headroom who was like a thing for 20 minutes in the 80's. Still, the two directors were stupid, they passed on Tom Hanks for Luigi because a couple of previous films of his didn't do so well, but what the hell has John Leguizamo ever done that warranted being picked over Hanks? The film is not Mario Brothers in the least, as unfortunately, the producers found out too late in the game what kind of film the directors were making, so they had to use the sets from the strange bleak desolate universe the directors envisioned instead of having anything remotely like Mario. The film was a mess of highest powers and the two main stars were drinking on the set to get through it, but yes, keep on thinking that it is somehow good, once again, you are just being one of those, ""You common rabble cannot understand what they were trying to make."" people. Well, the studio wanted a family friendly comedy and the directors wanted a dark film where Mario probably broke fingers with his plumbing tools so no one made the film they wanted and two ideas got pushed together to make an incoherent mess!The story, Mario and Luigi are plumbers who are apparently not brothers as Luigi informs Daisy that Mario took Luigi in and was like a dad to him, which considering their age difference makes more sense then brothers. Well, Daisy has a necklace that belongs to a meteor and King Koopa who looks human throughout the film, wants it to fuse the worlds together cause his is being overrun by mushrooms as King Koopa overthrew and devolved the king, because you know how devolving is such a huge part of Mario Brothers. At some point, when the film is nearly over, Mario and Luigi finally don their outfits from the game and it was probably the first and only time children in the theater were happy and not asking where Mario and Luigi were while watching this atrocity.So we get Bob Hoskins as Mario and quite frankly, he was too old for the role. Not sure why, but for some reason all the people they planned to cast for Mario were on the hefty side. Mario is not hefty, so not sure why they wanted him to be obese. John Leguizamo not a good Luigi either, but at least closer to the right age. Luigi has a mustache too, people. Dennis Hopper is well on his way to Waterworld crazy in this one, playing a role that should have been an effect or heavy makeup and Samantha Marsh as Daisy is bland and lousy as all get out, besides it is Princess Peach! Daisy was the name of the character captured by Donkey Kong! As for the delightful characters you find in a Mario game, none of them are really featured except Yoshi and a ba-bomb. If you played a drinking game where things that happen in this movie take place in any of the games, you wouldn't even get tipsy!So, this tragedy pretty much sucked, but now people claim it doesn't because that is the cool thing, but yes, it sucks. I mainly blame the directors as everything I have heard says that even the cast did not care for them or any of the other crew members. Then again, gotta blame the studio too, they picked the idiots based on their work on Max Headroom. Seriously, the show was cancelled after like a season and was nothing all that great, the commercials were stupid too, but you want them to direct a family film? Max Headroom should have told any studio head that they were going to think of themselves more highly of themselves and try to make their own vision. What they made was a film that probably made children and parents alike confused if they came in after the opening title sequence and probably wondering if they entered the wrong theater!",Super Mario Bros.
13,Mr-Fusion,Bring your own shrooms,5,14 July 2016,"I'm pretty sure the studio was trippin' when they greenlit ""Super Mario Bros."" Maybe the filmmakers just wanted us to see what Mario did whenever he ate a mushroom. I'm grasping at straws here, but how else can one explain such a disconnect from the video game? The game wasn't really that complicated; you're a plumber, you jump a lot and you run in one direction to save the princess. To be fair, there's nothing about the game that screams ""Hollywood movie!"", but this certainly isn't how you go about it.Bear in mind, I don't think the movie deserves its bad reputation; but don't go into this without recreational drugs. There's some wild stuff going on here, but if you walk in sober, it's not a whole lot of fun. More attention was paid to he convoluted lore and ""Blade Runner"" sets (in a Mario movie!) than telling an engaging story. Let me put it this way: Bob Hoskins is one of my favorite actors - I mean, the guy can do no wrong - but his talents are wasted on this.5/10",Super Mario Bros.
14,MovieAddict2016,"Pretty awful, although it does stay fairly close to its source material",3,25 May 2005,"Let's face it, a Mario Brothers movie never had much potential. First of all, the games work because of just that - they are games! They don't require plots to entertain us. (It's a nice addition, but in the case of Mario, it's not necessary and it works just as well without one.) The Super Mario games were always about Bowser trying to take over the world and kidnapping Daisy/Princess Peach (her name changed a lot in the games, didn't it?), of course a film adaptation won't work based just on this because: 1) It's not interactive 2) It's not deep enough 3) It has no merit whatsoever as a motion picture This film adaptation was clearly an attempt to capitalize on the surprise breakthrough of the Mario games and how much money they earned Nintendo back in the early-to-late nineties. There's no effort to make anything worthwhile out of this, it's basically just about a crazy villain who kidnaps a babe and Mario tries to save her.It's a shame really because it's so well cast. Bob Hoskins is really good as Mario and Dennis Hopper is pretty psychotic as usual. My biggest complaint? No Bowser. I guess it was too expensive back then.I do think with a great director, great screenwriter and great special effects artists this could be remade into a fairly entertaining summer blockbuster -- better than most game adaptations, anyway. (""Resident Evil,"" anyone?) Mario is a likable enough character and with someone like Lucas or Spielberg who love their special effects, the world could be better represented than it is here.But then again any movie based on a video game like ""Super Mario"" will never really become a classic, will it? It'd be best as an animated movie, like ""Toy Story"" or something.",Super Mario Bros.
15,OllieSuave-007,"Just Mario Bros, not super.",4,1 April 2014,"I guess I had too much high hopes in this movie to resemble the video game to a T. The movie's story itself is almost like the video game, with plumbers Mario and Luigi (Bob Hoskins and John Leguizamo) journeying to an alternate universe where evolved dinosaurs live. They find that they are the only hope to save the Earth from invasion, and to save Princess Daisy (Samantha Mathis) from King Koopa (Dennis Hopper). However, the characters, costumes, make-up and settings hardly resemble the game itself.I would have preferred this film to have more of the video game elements; in addition to the plot points of this movie, at least put in some question mark boxes with mushrooms or fire flowers coming out, and go down a few pipes. But, what you have is a pretty boring cliché save-the-princess and save-the-world movie with limited excitement. The acting is OK, though. Don't let the Super Mario Bros. video game melody at the beginning of the movie fool you. This flick is nothing close to having the video game elements. Some people enjoy the story itself minus the game elements, but I find that the story itself is still pretty cliché and unappealing.Grade D-",Super Mario Bros.
16,FeastMode,my notes,1,27 July 2019,Hilariously bad. 6/10 on the hilariocity scale. the best one-word description is absurd. nothing makes sense. and the way they tried to make it like the real mario bros was laughable. they must've been thinking no one would know the difference and just made up their own movie and called it mario bros (about 3 viewings),Super Mario Bros.
17,bowmanblue,Go goomba!,7,13 December 2014,"I watched 'Super Mario Bros' in the cinema back in 1993. I enjoyed it. Today, I still watch it from time to time on DVD and I still enjoy it. I guess I'm one of those select few who just didn't get the hate this film got.Maybe it was because, although I played a lot of video games during the eighties and nineties, I was rubbish at ALL Super Mario Bros games (and my cousin was annoyingly fantastic at them). So, perhaps I was unaware of all the hype and expectations this 'game to film' adaptation had attached to it.It's a family adventure film. Basically, there's an alternate dimension where dinosaurs evolved into humans instead of the monkeys who did over here. There, the evil dictator 'Koopa' wants to merge the two worlds and basically rule them both. Luckily, plucky New York plumbers Mario and his bother Luigi travel there to stop him. So, expect car chases, futuristic worlds and a few lasers and funky bazooka-like guns thrown into the mix.Yes, it's hardly a classic. Everything it spoon-fed to us on a plate. You won't need to exercise much brainpower to really understand what's happening here. Every scene tells us something we need to know and everyone speaks as if they're explaining the entire theory of the universe at all times.I thought it was good – just a light-hearted family, sci-fi adventure romp. But then I'm in the minority. If you've never seen it then you should be aware that 99% of people HATED it. It's largely one of the biggest cinematic flops ever. I guess it's because Super Mario Bros had such a large following that everyone of its fans had their own idea about what they wanted to see from the live-action film and they didn't get anything near. The computer Mario world is cute and colourful. The filmic version is a dark, depressing dystopia-future more akin to Bladerunner.When I watched it last, I guess one scene can sum up its failings (and not just the slightly dodgy 'goombas' masks which are blatantly just small masks stuck on tall men's bodies). It's a nightclub scene where the clientele are dressed in what I would describe as 'fetishwear' (complete with gimp masks). I guess the BDSM scene was not what most cinema goers were expecting from source material where mushrooms waddle about the screen and coins bounce up from floating blocks in the air.",Super Mario Bros.
18,Irishchatter,It's not bad but it's definitely not like the games...,7,9 September 2015,"From seeing this movie, I actually didn't mean it to be honest because it really did make me enjoy the rest of the film. The problem is really it is not like the games.Here's the changes I would like to make if I ever was involved in a film like this: *Change the plumber outfits *Have Luigi grow a mustache as well *Give the plumbers superpowers *Change the music soundtrack to the original game themes *Not have Mario older and getting a girlfriend who is not princess peach *Include Yoshi more *Add better villains including the goons and the bossI have to say, it wasn't a bad film but it would've been better if it was based off the video game. It would've been better for fans to think anybody could've made a great movie but unfortunately it did go downhill!",Super Mario Bros.
19,ironhorse_iv,You have to be high on mushrooms if you think this movie is good! Super Mario Bros is horrible.,4,28 September 2015,"The first ever full-length, theatrical, live-action motion picture, based on a video game was game over, before it even began film production. Originally planned to be released in 1991, the movie was supposed be, a Disney animated film, but things change, when a number of hand drawn animation films, tank at the box office. Since, that medium was really expensive to produced, Cinergi Pictures, Hollywood Pictures and Allied Filmmakers chose to do, a family-friendly live action version, instead. What, they didn't plan was, the directors, and a team full of screenwriters to ignore, their request; choosing instead a more adult-like dystopia film, very similar to 1982 Blade Runner or 1981 Mad Max 2: the Road Warrior. This version of the film, inspired many of the big name actors to sign onto the project. However, the producers feared it wasn't kid-friendly enough, so they forced heavy re-writes and barred the directors from contributing to them. The script was being rewritten so many times during production that the actors stopped paying attention to these daily rewrites, and instead, frequently getting drunk to go through it, knowing that it would turn out bad. This trade-off made for a very loose-adapted film that had little to no connection to the games. Not only did, this anger the Nintendo fan-base, but it also cause the general audiences, not to bother seeing this badly made film. I know, that an attempt to make a coherent narrative movie out of a series of video games was not going to be an easy task. I also know, as the movie was being written, the Super Mario Bros. video game series didn't have much story or defined personalities for the characters outside of the various cartoon series or somewhat obscure comics, but come on!!! It shouldn't be, too hard, to make a story about two Italian plumbers killing turtles in the Mushroom Kingdom. After all, there were tons of good visual fantasy films, before this with less of a story. It shouldn't be, too hard to make this movie, somewhat appealing. Instead, the movie delivered, pretty ugly grit looking film. Directed by Rocky Morton & Annabel Jankel, the film tells the story of Mario Mario (Bob Hoskins) and his younger brother Luigi Mario (John Leguizamo). They are two Italian-American plumbers trying hard to earn a living in Brooklyn, NY. However, their lives are turned upside-down when Luigi's love-interest, Princess Daisy (Samantha Mathis) is kidnapped by the evil king Koopa (Dennis Hooper) and taken through a mysterious portal that lead to another dimension, where instead of apes, dinosaurs have evolve into humans. Can the Mario Brothers save the Princess or will Koopa get his way, and conquer not only the lizard world, but the human world, as well? Watch the movie to find out if you want to! Without spoiling the movie too much, I really have to say, that the movie really misused their artistic license, way too much. I really didn't like, any of the settlings or how any of the game characters, are portrayed. First off, what happen to the Mushroom Kingdom and Princess Toadstool? What is this Dinohattan BS!! How in the hell, did an asteroid create a different dimension by its impact and how did Dinosaurs turn into human-like creatures. It makes no sense. It's also really hard to believe that the asteroid that rendered the dinosaurs extinct hit New York City, when there is lot of evidence even in 1993, that suggests that the asteroid really struck what is now the Yucatan Peninsula. Also as much, as I love the Devo guns in this film; nobody devolved scientific right in this film. Humans weren't chimpanzees in the past. Goombas are not are seven-foot-tall reptilian humanoids with tiny heads. They are a species of sentient mushrooms. They should turn back into mushrooms, not dinosaurs! Also Big Bertha is a fish; how in the hell, did she turn into a spikey large black lady. I know that the computer-generated imagery and animatronic visual effects were still in their early primitive stage, but come on! At least, they could had done make up! Anthropomorphism creatures would make more sense, than just showing random normal human looking actor pretending to be creatures. The partial cheap animation, they used in the opening, was pretty awful. Not well-drawn. Maybe, I should be, glad they didn't do, the whole film in animation, after all. Unlike, other critics, I really didn't mind, the acting. Nearly everybody did alright, despite, not enjoying working on the film. Despite, for a large portion of the movie, Mario and Luigi trade color schemes, and the fact, that Luigi having no mustache. I still have mad props to both Bob Hoskins and John Leguizamo because the movie harsh stunt works, pretty much nearly killed them. Bob Hoskins was stabbed four times, broke his fingers, electrocuted and nearly drowned. Leguizamo suffer a broken leg, during the car chase. The only actors, I can say, I hate from the film was Fiona Shaw's performance as Lena & Dana Kaminski as Daniella. Both were was really hammy and not needed. They should have used Wendy Koopa & Pauline from the games, instead. I doubt, it would save the movie. This movie Bob-omb at the box office. The film obviously left room for a sequel in the ending with the cliffhanger, but any plans for a sequel were all, but cancelled due to the bad reviews and sales for the movie. So, heads up on quite a few important plot threads being still left unresolved when watching. Overall: I really don't recommended watching this film. In my opinion, it's not that watchable, even when I was a kid in the 1990s. Really, I have no nostalgia feelings for it. It's pure crap. This movie deserves to go down the drain.",Super Mario Bros.

It's just a case of sitting back and enjoying the ride. The Mario brothers, Hoskins perfectly suited for the role as Mario as is John Leguizamo as his younger brother, Luigi, although their many years apart in age, are just your everyday plumbers, who unwittingly become embroiled in the popular video game, when Daisy, an archaeologist and new love interest of Leguizamo is taken by some accident prone bad dudes, one being the great Fisher Stevens of Short Circuit. From here it becomes a quest to find her, where we end up in a futuristic city, preferably the Bronx where we meet all kind of weird creatures, including the dorky, goombahs which are sort of cute, but look ridiculous, with their puny melon heads, but do steal some of the scenes. The movie is a lot of fun, but in my mind, I reckon it could of been much better. One can't overlook a certain mess to it, and a director team had worked on this. I loved Matthias, great actress, as Daisy, while Fiona Shaw made a solid feminine fatale, and of course, who else, playing the master villain with a lizard tongue, than, the late great Hopper. There are some stunts and Leguizamo, is funny too as is him and Mario's plumber garb. It's a shame the first twenty or so minutes in normalville went, as preferably I liked that part of the movie better. You'll have a lot of flashes of Total Recall in this too.

Considering that it had a big budget and well known actors, there's no excuse for it to be this bad. First of all, it doesn't really have anything to do with the video game except that they are trying to rescue the princess. Even though they don't even know that she is a princess. Bob Hoskins and John Leguizamo as the Mario Bros. was a ridiculous idea. They are literally the least Italian people in the entire movie. At one point Leguizamo even starts using the French pronunciation of Mario. There's no gold coins. Our princess isn't in another castle. There aren't even any castles. Even if you don't care that it has nothing to do with the video game, it's just a terrible movie. Bad plot, bad acting, bad everything. This movie should never be seen by anyone.",Super Mario Bros.

Super Mario Bros (1993) is half awkward parody of the source material and half nightmare, the sum being an unpleasant science fiction adventure that proved to be an embarrassment for all involved. The movie looks ugly, the writing is lame, and the comedy uninspired. The only performances I can really recall are Bob Hoskins' Mario and Dennis Hopper as King Koopa (or Bowser, as he's known in the games today). Both ham it up, but you can tell they're having no fun here, probably reminding themselves there will be a nice fat paycheck once the horrible ordeal is over with. You might find the insanity fun if you're in the right frame of mind, but otherwise, I'd avoid this one if you wish to preserve your mental well-being.",Super Mario Bros.

Loved it as a kid & still have big Nostalgic Love for it today.,9,25 July 2021,"Way back in 1993 the Super Mario Bros Movie was a huge deal, it was a massive Blockbuster movie that kids & teens just absolutely loved & i was one of those. I had the movie action figures & i got the movie on video (remember those!!!) & loved everything about that bizarre fantasy adventure.It's 2021 & as a 37 yr old man i still hold this movie dear to my heart. The legendary Bob Hopkins (R. I. P) was perfect as Mario & the great John Leguizamo was equally perfect as Luigi & they both were Excellent as the SUPER MARIO BROS!!!Yes I'm aware of the stories from behind the scenes that no one liked making the movie & i know its hated on & trashed on by many but i don't care at all as i like it & always have.Dennis Hopper (R. I. P) was also excellent as slimy & funny King Koopa & made a Cool villain.The story was really good too with our favourite Plummers, Mario & Luigi, who live in Brooklyn New York City & discover a parallel universe dimension type thing underground in the sewers & end up lost in a wild & weird new world that is ruled by the evil King Kooper & his mutant soldiers called Goomba's This new world has a City similar to New York City but it's more futuristic & full of Dinosaur creatures & wacky characters & here is the best parts of this unique movie in it's Amazing production design!!!! The detail in this huge set of the City is simply incredible & is where most of the big budget went & it's beautiful on screen. Samantha Mathis is Decent too as princess Daisy who is in trouble & even cute dino Yoshi is here & looks Amazing in all his practical fx puppetry goodness.This was 1993 so before CGI completely took over so the movie still holds up beautifully today & can rival sci-fi Adventure Classic's such as ""Blade Runner"" with it's look & Cinematography but something like a video game based movie wouldn't get that sort of respect but it deserves it.As said Bob Hopkins is great fun as Mario & seems to be really injoying the role as is the young & witty Luguizamo as Luigi & both are a delight together on this big futuristic, sci-fi fantasy adventure that anyone can enjoy. The costumes are perfect looking & colourful & the action is Cool & the humour is childish at times & silly but always with a sense of fun as this is a Big adventure kids movie with a light-hearted approach to the beloved video game. Super Mario Bros the movie is up there with the likes of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles 1&2 & Double Dragon & Street Fighter the movie & Masters of the Universe & Guyver aka: Mutronics & Judge Dredd all those types of fun fantasy action adventures that i also grew up watching & loving.Super Mario Bros the movie to me is a big piece of Escapism & a big piece of Nostalgia from my childhood & a fun & unique movie that i genuinely still enjoy.",Super Mario Bros.

26,Samiam3,Artificial but cute,6,8 August 2010,"I'll give credit to the Mario Bros. movie where credit is due. It is cute and quirky, but not for a moment does this feel like the game which became a revolution. In fact one could easily argue that the makers of the Super Mario Bros. movie are using the names, Mario, Luigi, and Daisy, and Koopa, as a loop hole to get a green light on this otherwise, irrelevant, cartoonish story which only an idiot would want to sponsor. In the end, it's not bad, but it might help to treat this as something else, that way there is no frustration over the fact that the bros. have Brooklyn Accents, Yoshi is a real dinosaur, and Mario is old enough to be Luigi's dad practically.For a low budget film, the art department did a good job of building fantasy world of funny faces, places, props and visual effects (both digital and mechanical). We are used to seeing Mario in the great outdoors, hopping mushrooms, giant venus flytraps or clouds, against a blue sky. You won't see any of that here. The movie goes for something a bit more...urbanized.Bob Hoskins and John Leguizmo are a very mixed matched couple. Hoskins looks right for the part, but Leguizamo looks and behaves more like his son than his brother. It is curious why the decision was made not to give Leguizmo a moustache. It would've helped age him a bit it think.As it stands, the movie may be amateurish and too chirpy to generate excitement, but it's good for some laughs and a few visual charms.",Super Mario Bros.
27,brando647,Nothing Super About These MARIO BROS.,3,13 April 2011,"Here it is...the one that started it all. SUPER MARIO BROS is the first film adapted from a video game, and we were lucky (or unlucky?) it wasn't the last. I was the target age when this film was released in 1993 and even I couldn't be bothered with it. At this point, you'd be hard-pressed to find someone who isn't familiar with the Mario canon: the earlier games always involved Italian plumber Mario (and occasionally his brother Luigi, when playing with a friend) working his way through the magical Mushroom Kingdom to rescue the princess from evil King Koopa. The plot is essentially the same here: Mario and his brother Luigi are a couple of unsuccessful plumbers in Brooklyn who become involved with Daisy, a paleontologist who's uncovered a strange meteor impact site under the Brooklyn Bridge. When Daisy is kidnapped by the inept Koopa cousins, Iggy and Spike, Mario and Luigi jump into action and enter an alternate dimension where humans evolved from dinosaurs/lizards and the realm is ruled by Koopa, who has plans on using the meteor to merge his dimension with others so that he can rule our world.So, yeah, the filmmakers kept the whole ""plumber saves princess"" routine and even kept a lot of the character names, but that's about where the similarities end. Sure, you'll find references to the game scattered throughout the movie...Thwomps, Bullet Bills, Bob-ombs, and apparently flamethrowers have been subbed in for the iconic fire flowers. Instead of the Mushroom Kingdom, we are given ""Dinohatten""...some sort of rundown metropolis that reminds me of Detroit from a post-apocalyptic future where automobiles now function in the same fashion as bumper cars. Whereas the game utilized various landscapes ranging from vast oceans to colorful forests, here it's all dank cityscape with a bit desert thrown in. It all ties in with another major flaw in the movie; I don't think it could decide if it wanted to be aimed a kids (you know, the target audience) or adults. It's as if the studio gave up on trying to make a normal Mario movie and jumped right to the gritty reboot. The Mario games are full of colorful worlds (all right, unless you're playing on Game Boy) with oddball enemies; the movie feels like a watered-down MAD MAX with dinosaurs.It really is a shame that such a bad movie has such a good cast. Bob Hoskins, John Leguizamo, and Dennis Hopper...a recipe for awesome wasted on crappy writing and cheesy dialogue (""Anything's possible, Mario. You just gotta believe.""). The supporting cast are a series of jokes. The Koopa cousins, Iggy (Fisher Stevens) and Spike (Richard Edson), are ridiculously stupid and their back-and-forth Stooge-like antics aren't funny at all. I mean, really, they felt the need to include a glass pane hauler gag where Spike is tailing Daisy and walks into a window pane. Toad (Mojo Nixon) is now a folk singing Anti-Koopa activist and the Goombas, a staple of the Mario games, are dinosaurs with shrunken heads. And don't get me started on the group of kidnapped Brooklyn girls held captive in Koopa's tower...never have I wanted to slap the stupid out of someone so badly. Samantha Mathis sleeps through her role as Princess Daisy (as opposed to, say, Peach...you know, like in the games). With the whole ""real world is completely separate dimension from Dinohatten"" angle, Daisy sure adapts fast to the weirdness she encounters. For someone who grew up in the ""real"" world, she sure doesn't take long to accept that her true father is now a widespread mass of fungus.I hate to be such a downer on a movie based on one of my all-time favorite video game franchises, but this movie never should've happened. The gritty realism should've been dropped for faithfulness to the source material. It should've been a colorful, fun kid-oriented movie and it probably should've been animated. Now is the perfect time for a reboot; CG animation movies are looking better and better and it would be awesome to have Pixar or Dreamworks adapt the game into a more faithful, fun family film. When Hollywood had finally decided video games were a rich source of inspiration for film, maybe they should've gone with a game that came with a stronger plot: Zelda, Contra, etc. Though I suppose we should just be glad they didn't start with Frogger or Tetris.",Super Mario Bros.
28,TedStixonAKAMaximumMadness,"""Super Mario Bros."" (the movie)... Despite having a Great Cast, this Movie Stinks All Around for One Main Reason- Totally Ignoring the Source Material!",4,23 January 2011,"The incredible Bob Hoskins and the hilarious John Leguizamo star in the 1993 adaptation of the popular video game ""Super Mario Bros."" A lot of people haven't heard of this film, and for some good reasons- it was a critical and commercial failure, seems to only exist as a cult film now, has been disowned by many of its stars, and for it's greatest offense- complete and total disregard for its source material.The games were essentially fantasy, taking place in the magical Mushroom Kingdom ruled by Princess ""Peach"" Toadstool, and teaming with the various other character who inhabit it (such as Toad, Yoshi and of course Mario and Luigi, plumbers). The evil King Koopa (or ""Bowser"") will occasionally attack in some attempt to conquer the kingdom, but the heroic brothers Mario and Luigi are always there to stop him. That's about it for the story- it's very basic, very simple. It works. It's a tried and true formula. Just your basic knight-in-shining-armor-saving-the-day.You'd think something so basic would be impossible to mess up. Somehow, this film did just that.Directors Rocky Morton and Annabel Jankel (apparently with help from several other uncredited directors) along with a team of writers brought this film to the masses. While the games were bright, colorful fantasy with a simple story, Morton/Jankel completely twisted the entire story into a sort of dark-yet-childish Sci-Fi ""What if?"" about New York City and parallel dimensions and dinosaurs who escaped extinction. The opening scene of the film alone changes the entire set-up for the story, and within 5 minutes, you could easily forget you're even watching an alleged Mario movie.But I'll get back to the blatant source-material slaughter later, and address the movie on its own (limited) merits now.The film starts out with a ""flashback"" that theorizes that the meteor which ""killed"" the dinosaurs instead created a rift and an alternate dimension where the dinosaurs were transported, and able to evolve into intelligent, human-like beings. We then see the feared dictator of this alternate dimension, King Koopa (Dennis Hopper) pursuing a woman in our world, trying to get back a shard of the meteor- though it's never fully explained, re-inserting this shard into the meteor will merge both dimensions, and allow Koopa to take over our world. The woman drops off a large egg at a church, before appearing to die, while Koopa is sent back to his world. The egg hatches, and a human baby female is found inside.Years later, the ""Mario Bros."" (although in this film, they are changed into adoptive father/son figures), owners of a small plumbing business in Manhattan, are dealing with frustration with a rival- Scapelli Construction, who seems to be stealing most of their work.The baby has grown into Daisy, a beautiful young archaeologist who is excavating dinosaur fossils around the Brooklyn Bridge. She and Luigi meet and fall in love, and one night, Luigi and Mario are forced to pursue her after she is kidnapped by Iggy and Spike, minions of Koopa. They get pulled through an inter-dimensional portal, and end up in Dinohattan (or so I've heard it called), the other-dimension's equivalent of Manhattan. From there on in, it's basically a rescue-the-damsel-in-distress tale, and is more of a light Sci-Fi adventure than a true Mario tale.To give credit where credit is due, there are some good things about this film. For one, the effects are nice and unique, especially for an early 90's film. The production design is quite cool, Alan Silverstri's score is ""Mario-esque"", and the visuals are generally interesting and fun to look at. The cast kinda, sorta works in its own way, and Hoskins/Leguizamo are a ton of fun as the leads.But the movie also does so much wrong. For one thing, as mentioned before, the film totally ignores the games, outside of using character names. There is no Mushroom Kingdom (the setting of the games), all of the animal characters are now human, the brothers are no longer brothers, too much time is spent in the ""real world"", they used the little-known Daisy character from the games instead of Princess Toadstool (Mario's love interest) so the younger ""brother"" could get the girl and appeal to the audience, Mario and Luigi's jumping ability are now the work of futuristic shoes. Nothing is designed to look remotely the same. It was like the filmmakers tried their hardest to do anything except make a faithful movie.Also, the film is full of other problems- a large portion of the humor is not funny. A lot of the direction is sloppy. A lot of plot points are poorly written. Dennis Hopper is pretty atrocious as Koopa. The rules are not clearly established. Etc. In addition, the movie tries too much to wink and nod to the fans- at one point, Luigi even talks about being a video-gamer. It felt like they were trying to make a movie about people who play Mario Bros., rather than an actual Mario Bros. movie... an even in that respect, the movie fails overall.This film was fun for me as 5-year-old when it first came out, as I had no real grasp on anything, and was wowed by the cool visuals. In retrospect, though, it's apparent animosity towards it's source material, and it's other faults are impossible to ignore. I have no problem with filmmakers changing some things for an adaptation, but this was ridiculous- they changed everything, and didn't even do a good job at it. Even if the movie wasn't based on ""Super Mario Bros."", it would have stunk because it's too sloppy and too basic.While not atrocious, this film is still pretty bad.

29,Screen_Blitz,Just about everything a video game-based film shouldn't be,1,28 April 2016,"Since his debut on the classic Donkey Kong Arcade in the early 80s, Mario has become been the official mascot of the company Nintendo, and shines as a major cultural icon to the video game industry. Appearing in over hundreds of video games, this Italian plumber has been made a worldwide phenomenon and has contributed to being the biggest video game legacy. He is recognized as the small plumber known venturing through magical worlds in search for a princess named Peach who is often kidnapped by an evil reptile named Bowser, while avoiding obstacles such as creatures ranging from Koopas Troopas, Goombas, hammer bros, probably too many to name at the top of my head, as well as making several appearances as a kart racer. He's also made some appearances in a few cartoon shows. But how would this character turn out in a live action film adaption? This question seeks answer from directors Annabel Jankel and Rocky Morton in this astoundingly ill-fated that puts the iconic characters in the light of cinematic waste. Bob Hoskins and John Leguizamo take the roles of Mario and Luigi, the two iconic brothers who run a plumbing business in the city of Brooklyn. One day, their world is turned upside when they meet the beautiful blonde Daisy (played by Samantha Mathis) -- not Peach, who Luigi falls in love with, only for her to be kidnapped two fledging criminals Iggy and Spike (played by Fisher Stevens and Richard Edson) led by the evil King Koopa (played by Dennis Hopper) of a futuristic world that is ""apparently"" supposed to the Mushroom Kingdom. Pulled into this mysterious parallel universe, Mario and Luigi must rescue Daisy and stop Bowser from his devious plan to merge his world with ours and take over the universe. What results from this film adaption is a cheesy, sloppy, poorly acted video game-based adventure that sprawls through just about every element that makes video game-based an hour and half of total disappointment. And this all begins from the opening scene showing an utterly pointless backstory of the asteroid impact that led to the mass extinction of dinosaurs. Soon, when we are introduced to the Mario brothers who work as plumbers for living and encounter Daisy who serves as a prominent character of the plot, despite being a little known character in the game series while popularly known Princess Peach is left strangely out of the picture. Daisy forms a relationship with Luigi in a chemistry that quickly flies off a laughable, particularly judging by the awkward dialogue between the two. Why Daisy is assuming the damsel in distress over Peach is anyone's guess. Before long, the plot kicks off to Mario and Luigi entering an odd futuristic city that bears no resemblance to the Mushroom Kingdom, and thats when we meet the antagonist King Koopa who is portrayed by Dennis Hopper sporting a tuxedo with fake spiky hair instead of the scary, fire breathing reptile we know him for. The worse comes when he meet the Goombas, a band of tall, creepy green-head aliens with broad shoulders and grungy smiles rather than the mushroom-shaped little critters shown in the games, definitely too tall for Mario to jump on. Then throughout the rest of the story, the film spends time lazily shoehorning vague references to the game and adding very small resemblance to the source material.Our main characters Mario and Luigi definitely mark the low points of the careers of both Bob Hoskins and John Leguizamo. These two both give off performances that are simply too cheesy and laughable to bear. The chemistry between these two is only half-enjoyable and by the end, they simply don't mesh. The rest of the cast don't serve much justice either, particularly Dennis Hopper who delivers a horrendous portrayal of the main villain viewers already have a difficult time taking seriously. The biggest redeeming qualities they bring may be the occasional laugh-out humor that comes in very few scenes, but it's certainly not enough to bear how poorly written and developed their characters are. The primary excitement viewers can garner maybe the some the action scenes featuring some passable special effects. By then, the fun is short-lived. The plot certainly isn't fun, especially considering the inconsistencies that fall so frequently it leaves viewers questioning if they are even watching a Mario movie anymore. Super Mario Bros is huge cinematic mess of a movie based on a video game that shows just about every aspect a video game-based picture shouldn't be. Whether it's from the lazy acting, writing, plot development, or the overall shortage of faith to the widely popular source material; this movie is a massive disappointment. The Mario franchise are the type of video games that just too cartoonish to be emulated in a live action realm and therefore should be kept in video game format.",Super Mario Bros.

It was cool that they played the Mario music at the beginning of the movie! Bob Hoskins made an awesome Mario, but I'm not sure John Legiuzamo was right for Luigi. Mario and Luigi meet a girl named Daisy (Princess Toadstool) Luigi starts to fall in love with her. Later two guys take Daisy back to another dimension.

I was very surprised to find it different from the popular Nintendo video game.Super Mario Bros. is about 2 brothers who live in Brooklyn. They both run a local Plumbing business themselves. Although they have a tough competition with Better plumbing companies that steal their clients' interest on them.Mario is the older brother while Luigi is the younger brother. One day Luigi meets Daisy an ordinary girl who is an archaeologist who discovered remains of a deformed dinosaur fossil at an area in Brooklyn which is said to be the original siting of a Meteor Crater.One night when Luigi and Mario fixed the plumbing system near the digging site with Daisy, 2 mysterious guys come out of no where and kidnap Daisy.They went through a tunnel underground and found a dead end with no where out. But the Dead End is in fact a portal that leads our plumbers to a dark and twisted world with Dinosaur people, fungus and deformed dinosaurs. Our heroes are now wondering: What is this place? And what became of Daisy? This movie is pretty good. Just it's nothing like the Video Game. It's 90% different from the original video games. Those who like B-Movies might in joy this movie. Those who are obsess with the Mario Bros. Video Game might not like the way this movie is made.",Super Mario Bros.
32,one9eighty,Here we go!,5,4 January 2021,"Directed by Annabel Jankel and Rocky Morton, this 1993 film was pulled together by the writing trio of Parker Bennett, Terry Runte, and Ed Solomon. When the question of ""Can you make a movie out of a video game?"" was asked, these guys came calling and answer... well, they tried to answer it anyway... well, they tried and failed and nearly killed a video game dynasty, but who is pointing fingers here?? Let us take a moment to look back at a film which nearly cost people their careers, a film which, for anybody that lived through it, stinks of the early 1990's.What is it about?
Mario Mario, and Luigi Mario are American-Italian Brooklyn-based plumbers who are struggling due to the competition from the Mafia-operated Scapelli Construction Company. Luigi falls for and goes on a date with a young paleontologist called Daisy who gets kidnapped. Determined to rescue her Luigi and Mario take up the pursuit which sends them through an inter-dimensional portal to a weird and distant dimension where dinosaurs and lizards evolved as the dominant species on the planet. It is in Dinohatten that Mario & Luigi learn the truth about Daisy who is a long-lost Princess. Her father has been overthrown and devolved into fungus by the evil tyrannical dictator King Koopa. The dino-evolved world is running out of water and Koopa has a diabolical plan to merge realities with the ape-evolved world so he can be ruler supreme. It is up to the super Mario brothers to save the day and defeat King Koopa.Cast
Cast as the titular plumbers are Bob Hoskins and John Leguizamo. Obviously, a lot of time has passed since this film, and in that time, I have been able to read lots of things about it. Both leading actors in this made no secret about how much they hated it at the time. Neither of them were first choice in the roles, neither of them really understood what they were getting into or what the film was about, and both confessed to drinking regularly throughout the production just to get through it. In a role as their nemesis, Dennis Hopper does not speak that highly of the film either, stating in some publications that it was the worst film he had ever worked on. While these were the big three names associated to the film at the time, they did not embarrass themselves much due to the script, they do a decent job and carry themselves off well. As Daisy, Samantha Mathis is fresh faced and captures attention in all her scenes. She does really well as a damsel in distress. If you like useless knowledge for quizzes, then Lance Henriksen is The King in this film, and Frank Welker and Dan Castellaneta lend their voices - that's Fred Jones (see Scooby Doo)/ Megatron (see Transformers) and Homer Simpson (see The Simpsons) to us mortals!!Reception
This film bombed big time. It did not even recoup it is $45 million budget, only taking $20.9 million. If you look at other films of that year, there is a clear difference in class - ""Jurassic Park"", ""Mrs Doubtfire"", ""The Fugitive"", ""Schindler's List"", ""Sleepless in Seattle"", ""Philadelphia"" ... even ""The Leprechaun"" and ""Army of Darkness"" seem worlds apart from this film. The film was considered to be a little too far away from its source material, it tried too hard to make an authentic story which humanised a video game character. It might have been received better if it had of gone down the route of a fantasy and fiction instead of trying to tie in into real life, but alas, it did not. This film bombed that bad that Nintendo put on hold any plans it had for a future video game to movie feature, of which ""Metroid"" was in the pipeline, and decided it would not risk it. Nintendo and its Mario franchise were a massive success - this film went close to embarrassing the company and nearly killed the video character. It was not until ""Detective Pikachu"" was released in 2019 that Nintendo really decided to dip their toes back in the water. Despite the negativity, Nintendo, and Mario creator Shigeru Miyamoto were consummate professionals about the whole thing. They never once publicly complained, and even went as far as saying ""it was a very fun project that they (entire production cast) put a lot of effort into"".My thoughts
Despite the negativity this film received and still gets linked to, I did not hate it at the time and I still do not. Sure, it was never going to be an Oscar winning film or be recognised as a the ultimate in film making. What it was though it a start - a start for video games to be made into films. In my teenage years (I was 13 years old when this came out) I saw this as something fun and something worth looking forward to. I was eager to see my video game heroes be committed to the big screen. The adult me has a different point of view on the whole outlook mind, the adult me (I am 40 years old now but do not tell everybody!) looks back with rose-tinted nostalgic glasses on and cringes at the thought of video game wins being ruined on the big screen. Having lived through the golden age of video games I feel that some things are best left alone rather than ruined.Yes, this film is based on video game characters, but if you did not know that you would not be any poorer for your experience of watching it. This is a cheesy movie which still offers some fun. It stinks of a long-gone era - the 1990's - but it's an era still that wasn't all that bad. There are some good performances in the film and visually it is decent too. Perhaps the film fell down because of the constant re-writes that the studio made in trying to make the concept fit a particular pigeonhole. Maybe also because somebody designed the sets to be gritty and dark rather than run the risk of a pastel covered landscape which would look completely different from every other movie ever. One thing is for certain, this film is not as bad as people assume it to be, or remember it being. It is definitely worth a re-watch if you watched it back in the 90's or give it a try if you have never seen it before.Go into this film not expecting something on the scale of other successful game-to-films like ""Resident Evil"" or ""Tomb Raider"", not to see something as authentic as ""Detective Pikachu"" or ""Warcraft"" - but instead, go into this to see the revolutionary, albeit slightly flawed, video game to film that start the whole thing off in Hollywood. Go into this to see an average movie which is still better than other attempts at bringing video games to film, even if it is only just marginally based on the source material. With a runtime of 114 minutes and rated PG, it might not be the sexiest looking film, or the slickest edited and paciest film - but it is not as bad as some trolls online would like you think.",Super Mario Bros.
33,DarthBill,"Too harsh, by far",6,7 April 2004,"Yes, this no classic, but it's not that bad. And yes it bears no resemblance to the video games that inspired it except for the jumpsuits that look like the heroes overalls, but it's not bad.Mario & Luigi (Bob Hoskins & John Leguizamo) are the two down on their luck brother plumbers who get involved with a college student named Daisy (Samantha Mathis) who turns out to be a princess from an alternate dimension. Once transported there themselves, they must fight the evil King Koopa (Dennis Hopper) and save their world from being merged with Koopa's and the human race from being turned into monkeys.It may be hard to believe that John Leguizamo is Bob Hoskins brother, but the two have good chemistry and John has a convincing Brooklyn accent (although Tom Selleck would have been a more convincing Luigi in some respects). Bob reprises his gruff detective persona from ""Who Framed Roger Rabbit"" to great effect. Samantha Mathis is cute as the princess and manages to feel less shallow than most heroines in these situations. Dennis Hopper hams it up as the film's villain. Lots of gags and good natured humor, and a beautiful song from Roxette, ""Almost Unreal"". Worth a rental.",Super Mario Bros.

36,tomimt,It really was as bad idea as some sane people would think,2,21 February 2006,"I guess this movie was doomed from the start. It must have been a more savage hang over than usual in the plant of ""bad movie ideas"" when the whole idea of live action Super Mario film was conceived. I mean you all know the settings and story of Mario games right? A plump plumber in his red overalls jumping in the heads of mushrooms and turtles, I mean Koopas, and trying to save the princess. There just isn't any way, you could even try to turn that something else than a cartoon. It just doesn't work out too well as live action.But they did try, with a force of a four different directors, and yet they still failed. Or maybe that was the main reason why they did.The story has changed so, that Mario (Bob Hoskins) and Luigi (John Leguizamo), two brothers, who look nothing a like, come through a dimensional gate to the mushroom kingdom, where they must defeat the evil Koopa (Dennis Hopper) and save the princess (Samantha Mathis) and the king (Lance Henriksen).It's not that there would be a bad cast in the film. In fact the line up is rather good, even solid as some might say. It's just the execution of the film that pushes this towards the oblivion it deserves to be in.You can watch it for the sake of interest, but it really takes a good bunch of Mystere Science Theatre minded friends to do so correctly. I gave it two out of ten just for the sake of the cast. You just can't beat Hopper as a mad Koopa... Or Hoskins as Mario.",Super Mario Bros.

The movie is great for the kids to see, and I most certainly enjoyed it when I was a kid. It was exciting to see Mario and Luigi together, and Luigi is probably my favourite character within the video game franchise. The movie isn't supposed to be taken too seriously since it's based of a video game; in fact, I'm glad it was actually made, especially during that time where Mario was getting very popular. The movie was fun and entertaining. Made in the nineties too. There were too many good kids movie during that time, and this is one of them.

40,bregund,"Don't waste your time on this one, folks",1,13 November 2002,"Wow, what an awful film!  That's about the only thing it has going for it.I just saw this movie on the Disney network.  I remember playing the video game a few times and got a kick out of it, even though I don't normally play them.  The movie is absolutely nothing like the game.  Everything is dark, wet, and cold; unlike the game, not a bright color can be seen anywhere in the film.The ebullient Bob Hoskins does his best to buoy the faltering plot, but alas even his considerable talents cannot save the film.  There is some claptrap about a meteorite stone, evolution and de-evolution, and a burning desire for the underworld to take over the land of the humans.  Fiona Shaw's superb acting skills are wasted in this godawful mess of a movie (click on her name in the credits.  I urge you to rent one of the other movies she has appeared in to get an appreciation of this actor's skills).  Dennis Hopper plays the same character he always plays, except this time he has really weird cornrow hair and holds his arms out like those of a Tyranosaurus Rex (because he's descended from one, you see).The film takes forever to get going.  Instead of the bright and happy setting you might expect, we're given a filthy city setting, some nonsense about dinosaur bones, two-dimensional villians courtesy of rent-a-villain (I think they're listed in the end credits), two bumbling shlubs (what corny movie would be complete without them?), and one sloppy lead character, just like all the other sloppy lead characters you've seen thousands of times.Given the popularity of the Mario Brothers video game in the early 90s, one might have expected this film to be the Harry Potter of its time.  It fails in nearly every aspect.",Super Mario Bros.
41,The_Light_Triton,You either like it or hate it.,5,8 October 2009,"And for me, it's kind of a mix.But first, let's talk about movies and video games mixing together. We discovered in 1983 that turning movies into video games was mostly a bad idea (Thank you, E.T. Great movie, 2nd worst video game of all time according to Gametrailers.com) And it resulted in the video game crash of '83, nearly taking out a whole industry. But 2 years later, we are Re-introduced to video games thanks to an average Joe named Mario and his brother Luigi, who are thrust into a journey to rescue a princess in an alternate world. And we loved it.Now skip ahead to 1993. Mario has become intensely popular. So popular he's got a TV cartoon, along with rival Sonic the Hedgehog...but one thing that Mario gets that Sonic doesn't...A real life movie. But like movies to video games, it's the same result when you send video games...into a movie.You might think on first sight this movie is about Mario and Luigi (Portrayed by Bob Hoskins and John Leguiziamo, Respectively) travelling through 8 worlds to save Princess Toadstool from Bowser, but that's not the case. Instead, it's an alternate dimension complete with a city and endless desert, where Iggy and Spike (Bowser's children in the game, but Koopa's cousins in the movie) have kidnapped different women in hopes to snag Princess Daisy (Portrayed by the beautiful Samantha Mathis) and Bowser isn't called Bowser, it's a leader named King Koopa, Portrayed by a so-bad-he's-good Dennis Hopper (who made Steve Scott one of the most awesome characters in Grand theft auto; Vice City)The reason king Koopa wants to snag Daisy, is that Daisy holds a piece of a meteorite that struck the earth millions of years ago and destroyed the dinosaurs. But really, that meteorite did not destroy the dinosaurs, it instead created a parallel dimension where the dinosaurs evolved into humans with dinosaur-like features. The meteorite piece that Daisy has, is the key to merging the dimensions, allowing king Koopa to take over the human world we know. Yeah, I didn't think it made sense either.Bottom line, it's not the worst movie ever made, but if the directors and producers, and maybe the actors played the game, they could've made a much better movie.It was also hinted that the movie was going to have a sequel, but it didn't happen because of how unpopular the first movie was. that's too bad. maybe it will happen, just with a better storyline.5/10",Super Mario Bros.
42,Rautus,A pretty good movie,10,9 August 2007,"I've played the Mario games and I am a fan of them so I remembered seeing a bit of the film of Super Mario Bros. ages ago but I couldn't recall much so I decided to see it again so I bought the DVD and watched it and I enjoyed it, one thing I kind of like is that it's different from the games. If the film was all bright and colourful it might not appeal to older viewers so they had a bleak looking city instead, Bob Hoskins was great as Mario and so was John Leguizamo as Luigi, Dennis Hopper did a great job as the villain King Koopa and Samantha Mathis as Princess Daisy. Some references to the game are in the film like the Bomb-Ombs, Bullet Bills, the Koopa Coins are mentioned, the music at the start. Some of the characters in the games are in this only different like Toad, who in the film is a guy who sings on the streets, the Goomba's who are huge creatures with tiny heads, Yoshi who is a little dinosaur.The film sees two brothers who are plumbers in Brooklyin meet a young women Daisy who is working at a dig, one night Luigi and Daisy are in the sewers when suddenly they are attacked and Daisy is sent through a portal, Mario and Luigi then go through to find her and end up in a alternate world of Manhannten called Dinohatten, this world as created when the meteor hit Earth and some was sent to this world and now evolved, unlike Earth this universe only has one city and the rest is just a desert, the ruler of this world King Koopa wants to merge the two worlds together so he can rule both but to do so he needs the piece of the meteor that Daisy has but Mario & Luigi had it but lost it, King Koopa captures them and discovers that it's gone then with Toad he sends them to the De-evolution chamber where he turns Toad into a Goomba, his guards. Mario and Luigi escape and are pursed by them but with the help of a mysterious Fungus that used to be the first King they escape, but King Koopa is after them and won't stop until he gets the piece of meteor while Mario and Luigi need to save Princess Daisy and stop King Koopa from ruling both worlds.Super Mario Bros. may not be the best adaptation of the Super Mario Brother video games but it is a pretty enjoyable movie. 10/10",Super Mario Bros.
43,lordzedd-3,"If a format works, don't change it.",1,11 August 2007,"Okay, even though they got some great actors to be in this train wreck, that can't save it. A great cast can't do much without great material and they had nothing to work with. Why, do you ask? Being a fan of the video game series I happen to know something. Releasing a movie on a video game during the hight of it's popularity is a good idea, changing practically everything in said game is a real bad and stupid idea. Let's go through the list of what they did wrong, shall we? The Mushroom Kingdom isn't a major metropolis it's a fantasy world. King Koopa, or Bowswer which is his first name Bowswer Koopa is not a human nor a T-Rex, he is a prehistoric turtle. Shell on his back and everything. The Princess is not named Daisy it's either Peach or Toadstool. Goombas are mushroom monsters and Koopa Troopas are turtles. The mushroom makes Mario bigger and fire flowers give him the power to fire flowers. Now here's a biggie, Mario and Luigi are not that far apart in age.

44,TheMarwood,A messy mess,4,24 November 2014,"You know what you're getting into immediately when the first title card reads 'Brooklyn 65 million years ago.' Bob Hoskins, who hated every moment filming this troubled production and despised the finished product even more, appears to be having a good time on screen - which can probably be be chalked up to our two leads filming most of the film drunk. Mario isn't the most challenging of characters to play, but Hoskins brings enough charm to the roll. Husband and wife directing team Rocky Morton and Annabel Jankel murder suicided their careers with their reportedly abhorrent on set behavior and inability to run a production this size. Not that constant rewrites, dumbing already dumb material down, made it any easier on the two. This is one of those nightmare shoots where a misguided directing vision and an interfering studio collide and the result is a bloody mess. Why the directing duo would hire a large group of strippers for a sequence in their family film and not expect studio blowback, is one of many unanswerable questions that give this film its train wreck charm. Dennis Hopper, whose idea of quality control when choosing projects, is a check that can be cashed, even chose this as his most regrettable role. I can only imagine how badly this husband and wife team rubbed everyone, since plenty of films turn out poorly and while the actors may dismiss the final product, they don't regret the experience. Everyone involved at some point has expressed regret for stepping foot on set. The story is mostly incoherent and rewritten to death. While the simplistic story arc of rescuing the princess and defeating the villain plays out predictably, on a scene to scene basis barely anything makes a lick of sense - so there is some bizarre value in watching twisted art direction and decent puppeteering effects crash head on into juvenile gags, plot machinations that were made up on the spot while filming and a film that doesn't know if it's for children or adults. Super Mario Bros is a strange relic whose toxic reputation is still strong today and while there's little merit in defending this mess, it's hardly one of the worst films in existence.",Super Mario Bros.
45,Dockelektro,I think they tried something,5,24 January 2002,"Little is needed to say about this movie: Bob Hoskins himself said that ""Super Mario Bros"" was the only movie he was in where he noticed that something was going pretty awry. Anyway, I think the idea to adapt the video game to movie form must have sounded cute when they decided to invest money on this, but given that the Imdb credit list shows 4 directors involved, nothing good can be expected. The opening sinopsis is a revealing fact that we're in trouble: dinosaurly humans? Or humanly dinosaurs? Anyway, maybe kids will like this movie, the treatment that they gave here to the classic video game is an insult. Bad taste all the way, and once more money over reason to produce a movie that flopped big. Stay away from it, you won't like it, believe me.",Super Mario Bros.
46,renegadeviking-271-528568,Super Mario Bros. review,4,15 January 2021,"It can allow you to find 1993's Super Mario Bros. endearing in its earnest goofiness. It doesn't forgive the lost potential of what could have been a touchstone moment in legitimizing video game source material in the medium of film, but it allows you to take the ashes of this pop cultural train wreck on its own terms, and have a little straightforward fun with it. Yes, certain elements of the movie cross the event horizon of silly and enter the realm of the absurd, and yes, the aesthetic choice of portraying the Mushroom Kingdom as a sub-Total Recall dystopia is... disappointing for those expecting Mario actor Bob Hoskins to have another jolly old Who Framed Roger Rabbit romp, but going with the flow of Super Mario Bros. is not a miserable experience. It's an oddly diverting one.It's an understatement to say that Super Mario Bros. has gotten flack as an adaptation of the video game franchise. And sure, the contrast between bright, colorful, fantastical Mushroom Kingdom from the games and neo-noir, steamy, dystopian Mushroom Kingdom from the film is one of the biggest communal punching bags in the history of fandom. But I think there are successful, or at least entertaining, translations of game elements.It makes a twisted kind of sense to take goombas back to their roots as actual ""goombahs"" (emphasis on the ""bah"") in the Mafioso connotation of the word. Daisy, not Peach, is the female lead, and is given passion, agency, and strength of character while also growing into her role as Princess. Iggy and Spike's shift from buffoonish henchmen to Rosencrantz and Guildenstern-alike free agents is too bold a choice to write off. The bob-ombs are great. And when a voice in the crowd shouts ""It's a bob-omb!!!"", it's one of the movie's best absurdist jokes - in our world, ""It's a bomb!"" is one of the last things you would ever want to hear, but just adding that one syllable makes it hilarious. And best of all, the running joke about Mario being frightening of jumping is kind of wonderful.The outside-the-box spirit of the movie means it goes for crazy abandon. Fiona Shaw's gangster's moll character is electrocuted and gains the Bride of Frankenstein's hairstyle, for... reasons? Dennis Hopper's King Koopa makes his lair the top floor of a World Trade Center tower, making those scenes an odd watch nowadays. And this is a movie where the day is saved by blaring ""Somewhere My Love"" by Frankie Yankovic. (Yes, that weirdo's father.) It's all a carefree level of odd that's consistently watchable. As the postscript section below lines out, Super Mario Bros. foreshadows elements of other films. One film it fails to foreshadow, despite its best efforts, is its own sequel. This movie has the sheer nerve to end on a cliffhanger! Of course, an ongoing story was not to be. Making less than half your posted budget will do that to you.This way, Super Mario Bros. can live on as a curiosity, a one-off that blog posts like this can put under the microscope for some arcane purpose. But as the Mario license expands - cue marquee for Nintendo Land, coming to Universal Studios in 2019 - another movie must be on the cards. Now for all my advocacy, I can't say the 1993 effort is a good film. I have fun with it and will stick up for certain aspects, but it seems extremely unlikely that any future Super Mario movie won't clear this bar of quality. (Double negatives are where it's at!) The 1993 Super Mario Bros. movie is flawed, an occasionally embarrassing patchwork of off-the-wall ideas, but it's got heart, kid and a spirit of adventure. It's certainly better than a piece of garbage like Resident Evil: The Final Chapter.P.S.: Super Mario Bros. has a line in anticipating aspects of other movies. Predating the mighty Jurassic Park by a mere two weeks, Super Mario Bros. also features a primitively animated sequence voiced by a cheesily accented narrator explaining how dinosaurs can live in the present. Also, lovable Yoshi is in line with JP's popularization of the velociraptor as iconic design.

47,jonathanruano,Frank Welker as Yoshi and the Goombas are the best thing in this movie!,3,5 January 2013,"I want to start off by saying that the Goombas are the best thing in this movie version of the Mario Bros. games. They are not very bright, but they have hearts of gold, they like to dance a lot, one of them carefully prepares vegetables for Princess Daisy (after she turns down meat), and another one knows how to play the Doctor Zhivago soundtrack on his harmonica. In other words, the goombas are likable and entertaining characters who provide a nice distraction from the rest of the film.But here's the thing. The goombas have only minor roles in this movie. Most of them are played by extras whose faces may never be known by the movie-going public. Sure one of the extras can boast at a nightclub, ""Hey I played the most likable character in the Mario Bros film. I was a goomba."" But how could he or she prove it? So if you're only fond memory of the ""Super Mario Bros."" were those amusing, not very bright goombas, then you have just finished seeing a really bad film. To begin with, the sets for this film are terrible. I remember as a child that one of the things that attracted me to the Mario video games was the bright colours (large green hills, blue oceans), a plethora of evil critters (including ones that throw boomerangs at you), and having to run against a clock. But none of those things can be found in this Mario Bros. movie. The sets look like they came right out of a run down part of a big city that has witnessed record unemployment and skyrocketing crime. You would not leave your car there; you would not even drive your car there! But if the sets are too gloomy for words (and keep in mind I was having this sobering feeling when I was ten years old watching this movie. I really don't think this movie works for kids either), the characters are just as bad and probably worse. Bob Hoskins is a great actor, but he is a major disappointment here as Mario. He is not funny, when he intends to be funny, and he is not particularly likable. He is a colourless fellow who shows up on set to be chased away by explosions and one wonders if you are going to hire an acting giant like Hoskins to play Mario, then why not give him some interesting material to work with. John Leguizamo also was good in several other films, but he not here where he fails to generate any interest or amusement as Luigi. As for Samantha Mathis, she is just a pretty face as Princess Daisy. Dennis Hopper is somewhat more interesting as the villain King Koopa, but once again his immense talent for acting is being sorely under-utilized here.Thus, this conclusion: there are so many things not to like about this film that the unassuming, devolved, and compassionate goombas would have stolen the show if only there was a show to steal. Frank Welker, who does the voices for these goombas, deserves credit for his fine work, but sadly even his considerable talents cannot save this movie from the trash heap.",Super Mario Bros.
48,TheHande,A Truly Weird Film,4,2 December 2005,"It would be unfair to say that SMB didn't have its moments, but you really have to wonder why anyone thought making a live-action Mario-movie was a good idea. I admit that I enjoyed the minimal references to the games and some of the concepts were pretty nifty.I also have nothing against Bob Hoskins, John Leguizamo or Dennis Hopper, they're all great actors.However the movie makes so many childish mistakes just from a movie-maker's point of view that it looks like it was really just thrown together.

49,Olicosmic,A decent effort for an obvious cash grab,3,22 December 2018,"With a film about a video game series starring someone who didn't even know the film was based off of a video game at the time of acting in it, it was pretty much doomed from the start. All of this correlated into a disaster of a film that is this. To be fair, this isn't the worst video game movie I have seen, as the performances, set-up, and a few jokes are all decent. But none of that really matters when everything else just sucks. Nobody looks even remotely close to their video game counterparts. Hell, even the Mario Bros themselves look completely different. In fact, I can guarantee you that if someone didn't know the title of this film and if they had only seen some of it, I'm sure the very last thing on their mind would be Mario. For it being called ""Super Mario Bros."", it does an astronomically terrible job in replicating the video games. Nothing is Mario about this movie. Aside from the overly predictable plot that only works in a video game because it has gameplay surrounding it, this just isn't Mario. This isn't the absolute worst video game film I've seen, but it's still pretty damn awful in the grand scheme of things, and that's why I recommend that nobody wastes their time on this imposter of a movie. Besides the few highpoints I mentioned, this movie has nothing in terms of reasons to watch this, as it's too different for Mario fans and too predictable and cheesy for average film watchers. At the end of the day, all this is is an obvious cash grab, which, to it's credit, does seem like some effort was put into it. With it bombing big time at the box office, however, it seems that there hasn't been anymore attempts at cashing in on Marios populatity via film, which is definitely something that I'm not complaining about.",Super Mario Bros.

And then added a retarded script. And then using terrible CG. And then having bad acting.This movie sucked. I didn't want to say it, but it did. You don't take a video game and make the movie worse.

Unfortunately, it all goes downhill from there. The film has almost nothing to do with the games and it just came out as this tacky, annoying and clichéd mess. Most of the scenes, too cartoonish and lame-acted (not that the actors had anything to do with it), make no sense and neither did the ending. I tried to like the heroes, but the script made them annoying and stereotypical, along with the villain, who was also no good. It was mildly entertaining but mostly irritating. It's a real shame, as if it had a better singular director, instead of a man and woman who were rumored to be bickering all the time on set, and a better script, it could have been regarded as a cult favorite, and the cast and crew would have had a better time shooting.

I barely remember it from then till I saw this again just recently and now I know why I forgot about this....Super Mario Bros. is a live action take on the classic duo. What's wrong is highly evident right away. The video games were given a sense of pure style and beauty. The mushroom kingdom was a magical place with coins, bricks, power mushrooms, and is full of life and colors. Here, the kingdom is a desolate, ugly, and depressing modern day hellhole.Also, Bowser was not a turtle. He was the king of all Koopas. Where did this descendant from dinosaurs come from? Poor Dennis hopper. They did mention princess Daisy witch was a surprise considering Daisy was not very well known in the games at this time. Mario and Luigi are BROTHERS. Hoskins was well casted as Mario, but Leguizamo looks NOTHING like Luigi. How can we believe that these two are related? The only thing here that is close to the games is the Bo-Bomb.No mushroom powers, no fire flowers, no coins and worse yet, no plot. This was the first offering of what helped usher in a swarm of awful video game movies.(The first Mortal Kombat aside) The Last Word: Play the games instead.",Super Mario Bros.
54,BrickNash,"Cheap, insultingly dumbed down but made with no bad feeling!",5,7 April 2013,"Everyone knows Super Mario Brothers. The game was one of the best selling titles of the 80's and the games are still played to this day.So how well does it translate to film? In a nutshell, not very well but it's a wholeheartedly innocent attempt at any rate.I first saw the film at the Cinema when I was about 15 in 1993 and I came away sort of enjoying it. I think it's down to the fact that around that time people were becoming savvy to Hollywood botching film versions of established stories like comics and such. When I walked into that theatre I had absolutely no expectations about the film being true to the source material or any kind of notion that it would be really any good, and with that I sat down and was entertained for the duration.The bad points about the film is that is just dripping with studio exec. interference. This is a cheaply made film aimed at kids, not a kids film you understand. Goonies, Neverending Story etc. these are great kids films but a film aimed at kids is a whole different story.It's a gimmiky adventure film that bungles it's way through the story with a truly awful script, utterly dumbed down that's actually quite insulting to intelligent children. It's painful at times to see Dennis Hopper and Bob Hoskins, two of the great actors of modern time, deliver their goofy lines from the moronic screenplay.The film is cheap and it shows. Very bad special effects, sets and costumes don't add to the action but surprisingly it comes away with a certain feel which I found appealing. The goofy music that plays throughout and irritating 'boing' sound effects seal the coffin lid shut in a final insult to the viewers intelligence. Super Mario Brothers isn't a film you'd watch more than once, or even a guilty pleasure. It's the sort of film you would possibly put on to keep a bunch of 3 year old children happy for a bit.My review must seem scathing so far but I will say, it does have it's small moments. The Goomba (who looks nothing like their game counterparts) elevator scene just made me smile and certain scenes towards the beginning of the film seem genuine enough.As far as I know the director wanted to make the film much darker but was thwarted by the men in suits who wanted a kid friendly money maker and in knowing that I believe that the actors and crew did what they did with no malice intended and that sort of comes through a touch and this blameless feeling is what carries the film for the most part.I can't see how anyone could really hate this film, bad as it is!",Super Mario Bros.

Mojo Nixon as Toad was also fun to watch seeing is I knew about his music and still laugh to this day to his ""Redneck Rampage"" album.Dennis Hopper as King Koopa was hilarious as that wouldn't be the first guy I'd pick to play the role but he did it really well and looked like he had a blast doing it.The highlight of the film was the one liners but up and down it wasn't so bad.

62,wchngliu,Nothing Like the Video Games Themselves,1,3 July 2007,"This has to be one of the worst video game adaptations ever. Super Mario Brothers was the pits. I know people will say otherwise, but as far in relation to the games themselves, Super Mario Bros: the movie was truly woeful. The cutesy feel and innocence of the video games was replaced with a dark, depressing backdrop with characters looking ever more miserable and serious. Heck, the goombas were large lizards wielding flamethrowers, Mario and Luigi's trademark Red and Green dungarees were all black, and even Luigi's moustache was missing! As for lovable Yoshi, he is represented on screen as one horrid looking lizard.The director and creators of this film were probably not actual fans of the Super Mario games because if they were, then the film would've been faithful to the games themselves. Samantha Mathis was incredibly and terribly mis-casted as Princess Daisy when in actual fact, in the games it's Princess Toadstool or something on the lines of that.This film was utter crap and thus all those special effects which went into the making this film, proved to have not paid off. If anything, Super Mario Bros: the movie was a complete travesty and an insult to video game fans. And yet its travesty can only be matched by the just as appalling- yet pitable Streetfighter.Let's face it, video game based films do not work as well as it should and the flop of Super Mario Brothers exemplifies this very point.

In a review, Bob said he hated playing the character. He said that it was the worst thing he ever did and saying that his experience was a nightmare. Rest in peace to Bob Hoskins. Anyway, when I watched this film, it wasn't the true game that we all know and love. I did see a review about the action figures and I was surprised. The action is all right but this is not what I wanted to see.I just heard that the new animated Mario film is coming next year. I found out that Chris Pratt will be voicing Mario and Charlie Day voicing Luigi. I'm not sure about Chris playing the voice of Mario.

64,mwcrunner,A very poorly made film based on the video game,1,5 August 2016,"This is one of the worst films ever made. This should've been scrapped a long time ago and should've been made into a full length CGI animated hit. Now I like Bob Hoskins cause of him being Eddie Valiant in Who Framed Roger Rabbit, but Mario isn't cut out for him. Also Mario and Luigi are Italian, not American. Also whats up with Princess Peach not being in the movie and this Daisy person being a princess in it who is a freaking dinosaur? Also Yoshi didn't look like himself. He looked like he came out of the movie Jurassic Park. Also Toad should've been in this movie too but he wasn't cause its like the directors of this treated him like a push over. Also whats with the dance club scene in this movie and Mario and Luigi dressing up like pimps? I mean what kind of world are they in where people are Koopas and the king of them who is King Koopa a guy that looks like Donald Trump and Dr. Evil rolled into one? Lol. Sorry but it's true. Dennis Hoppers character looks like Donald Trump and Dr. Evil rolled into one. Also what was with all this fungus crap in this movie? I mean we did see mushrooms in it, but none of them made Mario and Luigi grow or gave them powers like flying or Koopa tails or fire. Also we only got to see one Ba-Bomb in this movie and that's also bullcrap. I mean if someone ever comes up with a new idea for a Super Mario Bros. movie, it should be a CGI animated one about where Mario and Luigi were born or where they came from and where King Koopa aka Bowser came from too and have all the good stuff that's in the video game, not a bunch of lizard looking like people and a Donald Trump and Dr. Evil combination abomination that later turns into a dinosaur like Muppet that gets turned into green slime and a woman who gets electrocuted and dies like Walter Donavon in Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade and 2 worlds one that is normal and one that is like Gary, Indiana and 2 guys who are just plumbers and don't have anything special to do like jumping and using powers and collecting coins. Of course there is going to be a sequel to the Disney animated video game film Wreck-It Ralph in 2018, so there's a good chance that we can see Mario and Luigi in that film since they weren't in the first one. This film deserves to be locked up in the studio vault never to be released again and forgotten for all time. Awful. Just plain awful.",Super Mario Bros.
65,antoniokowatsch,"Silly and funny, through and through",7,19 May 2018,"Yes, the movie maybe super-silly but it's so silly that it's actually really enjoyable. It's also pretty funny and one of my guilty pleasures. As the name clearly indicates it's loosely based on the Super Mario Brothers video game franchise. But don't expect the protagonists to just jump around like in the video games. When I said that the movie is ""loosely"" based on the franchise I was actually slightly over-exaggerating. The only commonality is the fact that both protagonists wear similar outfits and happen to be plumbers just like the original characters. Everything else was added to make the movie more interesting and I think it was done rather well. The whole concept of an alternate universe named Koopa-Manhattan is so ridiculous that it ends up making sense in the movie. The first thing that kind of jumps at you as soon as the movie begins is the typical Brooklyn accent of Mario. It was hilarious and totally added to the overall flair of the movie (which was also set in Brooklyn). I really liked that. The Brooklyn accent is one of the most recognizable accents and unlike the Queens accent, which is slowly fading away, it remains strong to this very day.The movie seems a little bit dated by today's standards but that can mostly be attributed to the fashion that is donned by the inhabitants of Koopa-Manhattan. It was very reminiscent of the 80's.Furthermore the movie has a lot of memorable scenes and dialogues. Most notably the scene where Luigi asks Daisy out on a date. That one is hilarious and has actually become a pop-culture reference that is still used today. So it does have a lot of pop cultural importance. A minor critique of mine is the absence of Luigi's mustache. I mean, c'mon... Luigi has a mustache just like Mario but hey... I guess you can't have it all.The movie definitely has a lot of weird elements; from police officers in studded leather uniforms to animatronic rats, it's a whole lot crazier than you'd expect if you just read the synopsis. I also found it quite hilarious that the ultimate penalty in Koopa-Manhattan was ""devolution"". And yes, it's exactly what you think it is / what it sounds like. On a ridiculousness-scale this movie is a straight 10. So if you like bizarre movies this one is a no-brainer. It is very reminiscent of the original Total Recall movie in both the presentation and the setting. So that should kind of give you an idea of the flair that it exudes.As I mentioned earlier the movie has a lot of memorable scenes and dialogues. Some of my favorite lines from the movie include:
""If I make you idiots smarter you won't mess up this time"" (Koopa) 
And the pipe-dialogue between Mario and Luigi:
Both walk into a room...
""Look at this.
It's a plumber's nightmare.""
""These pipes haven't
been serviced for years.""
""Must've been a nonunion job."" LOLAll in one it's actually a really good movie, just for all the ""wrong"" reasons. It's not trying to be philosophical or profound. It's just a fun to watch movie. I mean, if you take a movie like this seriously the problem doesn't lie with the movie but well... you get the idea. I don't understand why some people hate this movie this much. It seems rather bizarre to me. It's a family-friendly and goofy movie that also ends up paying homage to the 80's aesthetic. What's there not to love?Final verdict: recommended if you have a good sense of humor (and don't take the movie too seriously)",Super Mario Bros.

70,JTurner82,"Funny on a ""guilty pleasure"" level, but hardly worthy of its source material.",2,27 October 2005,"As a longtime Nintendo junkie I have to admit that the SUPER MARIO BROS. video game series is a legendary franchise. It was this platformer involving two plumbers rescuing a princess from an army of monstrous turtles (the Koopa Troopas) that single-handedly saved the video game market in 1985. The game proved popular enough to spawn multiple sequels and even a cartoon TV series (which, admittingly, is pretty dated and formulaic, but it did do a respectable job recreating the feel of the series). Given the successful reputation of SUPER MARIO BROS. as a game series, it doesn't seem surprising that a theatrical feature would be attempted. That film version premiered in the summer of 1993, and I was among those who were eager to see it.Unfortunately, the movie turned out to be a major box office disaster and was trashed in almost every newspaper. As a matter of fact, it started the whole ""videogames don't make good movies"" craze. I hope that this argument can be proved wrong, but SUPER MARIO BROS. probably will not be a likely candidate to challenge this accusation.This movie gets so many things wrong it's almost a miracle that I can write anything nice about it. With the exception of the characters' names and a few throwaway references, SUPER MARIO BROS., the movie has absolutely nothing in common with the video game series it's based on. The production completely eschews the lighthearted, colorful atmosphere of the Mushroom Kingdom and instead slaps on a dark, fungus-covered metropolis inhabited by dinosaurs evolved (yes, I said EVOLVED) into human beings. (One figures the scriptwriters mixed up SUPER MARIO WORLD--the only game in the series to set in a dinosaur-populated environment--as the ideal atmosphere for the MARIO franchise in general.) Instead of power-up mushrooms, fireflowers, and goombas, we get a human cast of villains acting (and looking) bizarre (even the chief villain, King Koopa is disturbingly portrayed as a human), raptors, exploding flameguns, and some totally ridiculous concept called ""de-evolution."" The nasty goombas are transformed from puny mushroom baddies into hulking lizards, and Yoshi, the beloved dinosaur sidekick of Mario, becomes a cuddly but woefully fake-looking baby T-Rex (and get this--he's Koopa's pet!). The whole atmosphere of this ""Dinohatten"" is too weird, chaotic, and cold to be engaging.This may sound bad enough, but the movie's biggest mistake is its failure to provide anything in the way of a coherent (or compelling) narrative. The plot is a jumbled mishmash about meteorites, alternate universes, and fungus that spends too much time indulging in its own stupidity rather than offering some intelligence. The movie's action sequences should provide spark and energy, but here they come across as strangely pointless and uninvolving. Despite the clamor occurring in the scenes, the viewer feels a strange sense of detachment to the whole thing. This makes the movie as a whole a major chore to sit through, as if there aren't any duller moments to bore viewers to death (such as a slow, inactive sequence where Mario and Luigi escape from a goomba-infested elevator). Matters are not helped by the ridiculously cheesy special effects, which are so fake that they come across as laughable.Even the aural aspects of the movie are displeasing; the soundtrack starts out promisingly with an electronic-sounding ditty of the classic MARIO BROS. theme, but aside from that, we got a fully-orchestral score (from Alan Silvestri) which is distressingly un-MARIO like. The same is true for the throwaway rock-and-roll songs, which were obviously slapped on for commercial reasons. The overabundance of screaming and overloud sound mixing is tempting enough to make one turn the volume down.Yet as problematic as the final result is, I do have something of a strange attraction to SUPER MARIO BROS. the movie. I admit to being crazy about the film when I was younger, even when all the critics were tearing it to pieces, and to this day I still wonder why I enjoy watching it every now and then. Perhaps because it's such a sorely misguided, warped, unimaginative mess that it ends up being a flick that can be fun to laugh at.To its benefit, however, SUPER MARIO BROS. does support a high-quality cast--which is quite surprising given that this is hardly the kind of movie that demands one. Bob Hoskins and John Leguizamo work chemistry as the brothers, even if they are nothing like their video game counterparts, and Samantha Mathis holds her own ground as the pretty Princess Daisy. Dennis Hopper's portrayal of King Koopa, on the other hand, is disappointingly uncharismatic and spends more time chewing the scenery than creating a character worth rooting against; Fiona Shaw is more effective as his dastardly secretary. All seem to take on their jobs with a good-natured attitude and do what they can with the mumbo-jumbo material.But even that isn't enough to qualify a good recommendation for SUPER MARIO BROS. as a movie. It's too unfaithful a recreation for MARIO fans, too noisy even for action-buffs, and too preposterous to reach a smart audience. If there's anything that I can say about this movie, it could be that it is a ""guilty-pleasure"" time killer that evokes plenty of laughs. So if you want to sit through a convoluted, incomprehensible action-flick that blatantly disregards its source material, then this is the movie for you. Otherwise, SUPER MARIO BROS. is not an example of great film-making, much less adapting a video game into a movie.",Super Mario Bros.
71,CrazyCockatoo2003,A video game adaptation so bad it's good.,6,30 August 2020,"Super Mario: The Movie (1993) is the video game adaptation to my childhood favorite video game franchise of all time, Super Mario. This movie is known to be one of the first live action video game based movies ever made. Personally, I think that this movie is so bad it's good.What makes this movie bad is that the dinosaur scene is stupid and makes no sense at all and adds nothing to the story, the de-evolution scene is disturbing, some of the dialogue is laughable, the cliffhanger was thrown in but was never solved due to the sequel getting cancelled, some of the characters look far worse than old Sonic from the live action/CGI Sonic movie, the production was nothing but a hellhole, the scene where Mario and Luigi fall into the dinosaur world did not age well and more.Also, my biggest concern is that this movie is extremally unfaithful to the source material in regards to a lot of the animal characters in the games like Bowser and Iggy being humans instead, the story has no connection to the games whatsoever, the characters look NOTHING like their game counterparts (possibly except Yoshi, Bob-Omb, Bowser during the second phase of the final battle and the Mario Brothers), some of characters have been flanderized for the worst and overall if feels like a different movie rather than one about Mario.However, some redeeming qualities include plenty of the references to the games (the Super Mario Bros NES theme song, the characters and more), it revealed the relationship between Princess Daisy and Luigi and the surnames of Mario and Luigi, Daisy makes a return after her first appearance in Super Mario Land, the soundtrack is good, the acting is decent, some of the special effects were groundbreaking for it's time, there are a few funny moments and the movie is so bad it's enjoyable, thus making it a cult classic amongst Mario fans.Overall, despite this movie being bad and very unfaithful to the source material, it has plenty of redeeming qualities that make this movie the cult classic it is today. I have high hopes for the upcoming Illumination Super Mario movie releasing in 2022, which should be at least better than this movie and most other movies Illumination had produced over the years.",Super Mario Bros.
72,benjaminweber,Visually abhorrent,1,12 March 2018,"At some point, when making this film, some genius made the decision to replace the vibrant and colourful Mushroom Kingdom from the Mario games with a smog-filled industrial swamp coated in diarrhoea-coloured fungus. Everything in the games looks clean and nice. This world is so dirty that characters literally have to be washed several times. This seems to be the general approach to visuals in this film. Almost anything that was taken from the games has been modified to look as disgusting and gloomy as possible. Even though the CGI is about 25 years out of date, I suspect they would have made it look just as ugly with today's technology. If you can somehow ignore most of the visuals in a visual medium, it will not save you from the acting, or the slow, meandering plot. This film was made solely to cash in on the success of Ghostbusters and the Super Mario franchise. It could not exist in its own right as a studio production.",Super Mario Bros.
73,Siloty,as lame as it is...,7,20 June 2008,"its actually entertaining. i read all over with people saying this movie was bad, but i bought it anyway just for the experience of watching the movie and i had some extra money.i sat down and watched this movie with no expectations whatsoever because i did not want to lean one way with my opinion. and i was thoroughly entertained.OK the storyline is a bit lame. that when a meteor struck earth, it did not destroy the dinosaurs, but split the earth by making a parallel world where dinosaurs lived. on earth (where we live) humans evolved from apes. but right next door, the people there evolved from dinosaurs.Mario and Luigi find the portal to the parallel world when Luigi's love interest was kidnapped by a pair of goons.the world they go into is crazy, the people are crazy. cars are just plain weird. and around the town are Goombas (de-evolved people done by Koopa as punishment) and baby dinosaurs can also be seen.there are some references with the games that you can see in this movie which i think just adds to the humour.its basically a lame little lighthearted movie that does what its supposed to do, entertain. if you go to watch this movie, have no expectations and don't think it ties in with the game. this is a story on its own.",Super Mario Bros.

""But if it was like the game then the movie would be boring LOL"" Exactly, which is why this whole entire project should have been scrapped. I mean, what were they thinking? ""Hmmm, the idea of a plumber running around, breaking bricks, killing enemies, and rescuing the princess is a boring idea, instead, let's just make up an entirely different plot."" So after having pulled this totally unrelated and awful plot out of their rectum, they decided to go ahead and make the movie. Making video games out of movies is one thing, but making movies out of video games is a completely different story. You can make an excellent game out of a movie, but it is very hard to make an excellent movie out of a game. In this case, the game would need to have a plot to begin with, not a shallow plot like the Mario games. The shallow plot works really well in video games, but it bombs on the big screen (just look at Street Fighter! Who's the genius who came up with that idea?) Don't see this movie.

75,badfeelinganger,Blade Runner Meets Beetlejuice: The Ghostbusters of the '90s,10,16 September 2014,"Blade Runner Meets Beetlejuice: The Ghostbusters of the '90s Super Mario Bros.: The Movie - Not Actually a Bad Movie! With a strong script, strong cast and strong company heritage in the field of CGI and video games based movie making, Super Mario Bros. was a surefire winner. All it required was a crack team of production crew and success was in the bag. This was assured by several legendary artists in the movie making industry with more-than impressive resumes. First off was production designer David L. Snyder - known for his work as art director for Ridley Scott's now-legendary film, Blade Runner.Snyder seemed to be the one of the only people in the end who focused heavily on game references, building the entire city of Dinohattan inside a disused cement factory complete with Hammer Bros Tattoos, the Boom Boom Bar, Wiggler beer etc. In fact his city designs ensured a striking sci-fi look that matched the dark and adult-themed sty-lings of the original script. There was also Alan Silvestri composing the music, most famous for his soundtrack to the epic Back To The Future trilogy, giving the film a massive boost in professional quality. If it was thought that Super Mario Bros would be a surefire flop, you wouldn't get artists of this calibre working on the movie.The plot sees Mario and Luigi drawn into an alternate universe created by the meteorite that killed the dinosaurs 65 million years ago. This meteor, we learn, formed a parallel Earth where a few dinosaurs survived and evolved into cold-blooded humanoids. Princess Daisy (Samantha Mathis) is one of their reptilian number, and she's been kidnapped by Iggy and Spike (Fisher Stevens and Richard Edson respectively), the underlings of the evil King Koopa (Dennis Hopper).Koopa, who rules over the dystopia city of Dinohattan, hopes to use Princess Daisy and her meteorite fragment necklace to fuse the two parallel dimensions together, and conquer the realm of humans. Needless to say, it's up to Mario and Luigi to head into the lizard dimension to stop him.The story's actually a bit more complicated than this, and there's all sorts of stuff in here about fungus and reptiles and resources. Really, though, the movie's more about spectacle than story, with directors Rocky Morton and Annabel Jankel (previously of Max Headroom and D.O.A fame) seemingly more interested in exploring the gigantic dark sets they had constructed in a disused cement factory in North Carolina.Here, lizard women push their eggs down the street in pushchairs, street vendors sell fried salamanders in bread rolls, and neon King Koopa propaganda posters glower down from skyscrapers. It looks less Mushroom Kingdom and more Blade Runner noir.",Super Mario Bros.
76,brailsford,"Were Sorry Mario, but your Oscar is in another Castle",2,13 January 2010,"While I agree this movie isn't the worst film ever created, it is bad, and does nothing positive for the games but at the same time it is watchable if you are in the mood for such a film.Basically the writers of this movie decided to go the trend of making a typical Alternate Universe 90's cyberpunk action film which spends more time on jokes and action and less time on making it relevant to the games and in that respect it was decent. The problem however is the fact that at the time this film was highly anticipated and an extreme let down to those of us who were fans of the game.Character Bios were rewritten, the Mario Bros aren't even biological brothers, Iggy is Koopa's cousin instead of one of his sons and the princess is Daisy. The film felt more in line with Total Recall or, Demolition Man. There was another film, Master of the Universe which had a lot in common with this film although that one actually fit with the series it was based on.Anyway if you want a mediocre action film that fits the era... this isn't horrible, but don't go in expecting it to be like the game.",Super Mario Bros.
77,IkuharaKunihiko,"20 years on, and this is still fun",6,22 January 2012,"Almost 20 years after a live action movie about Super Mario Bros. was made, it has underwent a certain kind of revisionism and is slowly viewed more favorably than before, since the sole fact that no producer or director (not even Spielberg) in that period managed to rally a whole movie crew to make a new Mario movie shows that this was a unique enterprise, one of a kind. Believe it or not, but today Mario Bros. has surpassed some praised blockbusters: as of writing this, I found out that the Super Mario Bros. ranks at #3.504 by popularity on the movie meter here at IMDb, which makes it more popular than some 1993 blockbusters (Cliffhanger ranks only #3.813, The Pelican Brief only #3.629), more popular than some classics (Gigi ranks only #6.985, Mrs. Minniver is not even it the top 10.000 list) and even more popular than some recent movies that won the Academy Award for Best Picture, mind you (Ordinary People ranks only at #3.585, Driving Miss Daisy only at #4.833 and not even The Last Emperor managed to score higher than #3.852). If we look at some of the highest grossing movies in 1993, like Cliffhanger or In the Name of the Father, we can find out that their message boards here at IMDb are dead, while the board here at Mario Bros. is still alive and active. Obviously the Mario Bros. authors must have done at least something right when the people are still talking about the movie in 2012.The movie is fun even today, despite the not so favorably viewed step to show the Mario Bros. in an ""edgier"", darker version where the heroes find themselves in some sort of a North Korea kind of world where everything was wasted in mismanagement and plundered just to suit the maniacal demands of king Koopa, whereas the cast in fantastic, from Bob Hoskins, through Dana Kaminski up to Dennis Hopper who seems to almost match his bad guy image from Blue Velvet, and the story has so many clever references to other movies (Koopa's line about loving mud because it is so ""clean and dirty at the same time"" is an obvious reference to a similar line about the desert said by the hero in Lawrence of Arabia) or simply spoofs some mainstream clichés, such as the constant bad language in some movies (""Egg-sucker!""). The de-evolution chamber is still one of the most fascinating bad guy inventions ever put on screen, even more inspiring than ""the dip"" from Who Framed Roger Rabbit, and if it was used in some horror movie it would have been probably praised as the scariest thing ever, you really get the idea what kind of a joint they are running.Even the detractors have to admit that the editing was top notch, the story flows smoothly and never drags for a second, that the score was spot on and that the set-design and costumes were perfect (nominated even for the Saturn Award). The long zoom in on Daisy in the castle in the fog still gives me the chills when I see it, while so many jokes seem to be lost on the ""grumpy"" viewers who tend to ignore them (Old Lady: ""You know, boys, this is a really rough neighborhood. You really shouldn't be wandering around without a weapon. You got one?"" - Luigi: ""...No."" - Old Lady: ""...All right...(brandishes a cattle-prod-like weapon) Get 'em up, suckers!""). I really wish someone would publish all the deleted scenes. The only thing I don't really like are the first 3 minutes and the last 3 minutes of the movie, since they seem rushed, and the fact that Mario and Luigi should have worn their overalls from the start. Yet, if you watch the movie with an open mind, you will be surprised at how it can work and how every movie works that way if you give it a chance.",Super Mario Bros.

I should also point out that I'm a huge b-movie fan, and find that most mainstream films pale in comparison to them. I find that the major studios can't generally produce so-bad-it's-good movies the way low-budget directors can (mostly bad mainstream movies are just boring); but on occasion they manage to pull it off, as is the case here. The movies faults are relatively well-documented, so I won't go into them here, but suffice to say, this is one of the best bad movies ever put out by a major studio.",Super Mario Bros.

Did the chuckleheads who made it ever play the original Mario Brothers video game? Huh. Well, I don't know, but I will say that this is perhaps the worst motion picture that I have ever seen in my entire life. Now, I could shut my computer off and end the review there, but I will explain why this movie is so hideous as it is. Maybe then will people avoid this horrible abomination.First of all, the movie has a different plot and overall different feeling to it than the cutting edge video game. There are no power up mushrooms, no fireflowers, no bloopers, no cheap cheaps, I could go on forever. And the Goombas and Koopa Troopas in this film are enough to make a kid throw up in his mom's purse. And why is Bowser a bad dialogued aristocratic Donald Trump like figure. He is a HUGE DRAGON THAT BREATHES FIRE AND THROWS HAMMERS! And do you think it's bad enough having Dennis Hopper play him.They didn't even get the princesses right. In this film, it's Daisy from Super Mario Land instead of Princess Toadstool, the princess from the original game. And who got away with making Mario and Luigi's last names Mario. It's like if my name was Derrick Derrick. See how stupid it is. Also, Mario and Luigi are not American. They are ITALIANS! Avoid this movie at all costs. It will make you want to scream bloody murder!",Super Mario Bros.
80,CalvinValjean,A Much Better Film Than Its Given Credit,8,28 March 2007,"I continue to marvel at the awful reviews this film STILL gets nearly 15 years after the fact. People who call this the ""Worst Video Game Based Movie Ever"" need to really get a life.Let's get one thing straight: no, it's not all that faithful to the original game. Toad, the little guy with the mushroom hat, is turned into a weird parody of Bob Dylan, and Koopa, instead of an evil dinosaur-looking monster, is turned into an evil corporate head.But once you get past these things, and just accept this as a stand alone movie, you actually have a pretty creative sci-fi adventure story. Two separate dimensions, formed when a meteorite hit, and a portal between them can only be formed when a tiny bit of the meteor is restored...dude, that's pretty cool stuff.Bob Hoskins is great as Mario, and he's likable in just about every film he's ever done. Some say Dennis Hopper just took this for the paycheck, but that's silly; if you liked his Frank Booth character in Blue Velvet, then you'll agree he's playing virtually the same character here. Yes, he's a little over the top...he's been over the top in everything he's ever done! The visual effects are pretty good for 1993...keep in mind this was released just a month before Jurassic Park. The Goombas are a pretty great visual creation. And there're a few good lines of dialog, mostly provided by Iggy and Spike. Overall, this wasn't a cheap little movie; you can tell that time and effort went into it.So it's one thing to not like this movie, but to say it's one of the worst ever made is just absurd. Mostly just an attempt to laugh off the Nintendo craze of the early '90's. Check out The Super Mario Bros. Super Show; now THAT was an awful show.",Super Mario Bros.

I looked at it as funny, as cheesy, as a fantasy movie, and as a video game adaptation, and it's still horrible. I don't understand how the movie was made like this.First of all, I completely understand that making a live action movie about Mario could not have followed the game's formula too closely. A fat plumber jumping on big turtles, growing when he ate mushrooms, and breathing fire when he touched a flower would have looked terrible. However, this movie carries almost no resemblance to the Mario games. You have Mario and Luigi as the plumber heroes. That's it. The big bad koopa is a dinosaur that has evolved into a humanoid dino. The Goombas in the movie are humans that have been demented into big lizards. Princess Peach is replaced by Princess Daisy. Yoshi appears as a pet to King Koopa.It's like they wrote a fantasy script for a movie and threw Mario into it so they could call it a Mario movie. The movie itself isn't entirely awful, but it doesn't at all feel like a Mario movie. Making a Mario movie shouldn't have been too hard. I give it a 3/10.",Super Mario Bros.

It wasn't the Super Mario that i don't think anyone knew. Then again, applying that to a real world adaptation is kind of tricky. How is it possible for 2 plumbers from Brooklyn to save a damsel in distress in another land that is overrun by reptiles? Quite simple, an alternate dimension. Which makes sense!!!! The explanation of how it came about is unrealistic and stupid in general. Another downside was the fact that Koopa is human not a reptile. Anyway, I do say give this movie a chance.

87,stefanbe,The embarrassment that is the Super Mario Bros. film,1,22 December 2007,"""Wasted opportunity"" is the phrase that instantly comes to mind, when one thinks of the immense failure of the Super Mario Bros. film adaptation of the classic video game. One of the most popular games on the Nintendo console, The Super Mario Brothers series is a fun way to pass a couple of hours. The story of the game is simple: a plumber must save the Princess from the evil overlord of her kingdom. Granted, it's not a particularly intellectual plot, but it's one that has been used very successfully many times before, from Robin Hood to Star Wars. With a talented screenwriter and some good direction, a Super Mario movie could have been a fun romp for children, teenagers and adults as well. Unfortunately, the film hoisted upon fans in 1993 was far from a good film. Super Mario Bros. is a gigantic piece of rubbish that is not deserving of the title given to it. The fact that it was produced by the man responsible for The Killing Fields and starred a talented group of award-winning actors makes this more embarrassing for not only them, but also us having to watch them make a fool of themselves.The plot of Super Mario Bros. is such an incoherent mess, it's as if they took the three drafts of the screenwriters and just mixed them up into one big pile. Mario Mario (Bob Hoskins) and Luigi Mario (John Leguizamo) are two brothers (or are they father and son, as the film isn't particularly clear on that) who run a plumbing business, which isn't exactly the most successful. One day, Luigi meets Daisy (Samantha Mathis), an archaeologist and he falls in love with her. When she is kidnapped by the henchmen of the evil King Koopa (Dennis Hopper), Mario and Luigi go off to save her. They land in a mysterious big city hidden underneath New York City, populated by dinosaurs that have evolved into human beings. Soon, they find out that Koopa wants the rock around Daisy's neck so that he can go up to the surface and rule over the Big Apple. Now, it's up to the Super Mario Brothers to save the day.To start off, the biggest problem with Super Mario Bros. is the fact it is absolutely nothing like the video game. The plot of the game, while simplistic, still works. The story that the film brings forth throws everything away and substitutes it for the ridiculous mess described in the previous paragraph. In fact, the only things that the film has in common with the game are the character names and the title. An adaptation does not necessarily have to be faithful to the source material, but taking away what made the original story work will certainly make the final version smell like feces, for both fans and general filmgoers. The screenplay is filled with jokes that aren't funny, action scenes that are just boring and characters with minimal character development. When a 16-bit video game excels better in all of the above listed aspects, there is definitely something wrong with the film version.The film also fails on a visual level. Super Mario Bros. is a dark film that while marketed for children, it definitely does not feel like it was intended for them. The sets are particularly disappointed, seeing as they could have saved the film. A Manhattan version of the Mushroom Kingdom sounds like a promising idea, but the filmmakers once again ruin the opportunity to bring something good to the proceedings. Super Mario Bros. looks as if they stole the set from Blade Runner and sneezed all over it. It's enough that they practically copy the style, but they essentially rip out what made that film look sleek. If Rick Deckard showed up in that city, he would have had a heart attack at what the set designers had done. The special effects also fall into the category of ""poor."" What makes that aspect of the film really bad is that despite being a Hollywood film on a big budget, the effects look like those of B-movies from the 1960's.Finally, the final aspect of Super Mario Bros. that could have saved it also fails. Bob Hoskins puts on the same accent he did for his character in Who Framed Roger Rabbit. Unfortunately, the superb work he brought to the screen in that film doesn't surface here. He just looks bored, wanting to leave the set immediately so he can go to the bank and cash his paycheque. I think I even saw one scene where he breaks character and glances at his watch. John Leguizamo doesn't fare much better as he's given the film's most banal and uninteresting character as well as dialogue. Through most of the film, he's just staring off into space. The same goes for Samantha Mathis, who is just dull. The actor in the film I feel the most sorry for is Dennis Hopper, though. Not only is the ""comedic"" material he is provided with not that funny, he also hams it to the max in his performance. He puts on different voices from a Baltimore accent to a Donald Trump impression and all seem to fail badly. You haven't seen the Easy Rider star until you watch him gleefully say ""Monkey!"" like a five year old. Or better yet, don't! Roger Ebert has taken on some recent controversy for publicly stating that video games are not art. This isn't a discussion I want to get into the middle of right now, but comparing the joys of pressing those colourful buttons to the horrific experience of watching this film, I have to side with the game enthusiasts on this one.",Super Mario Bros.

92,forecastmazy,"Come on, its Mario...",7,11 June 2003,"Alright. I saw this movie during the time you should have seen this movie for the first time. In 1993 when you're a kid playing video games. John Leguizamo wasn't a huge star then, he was just Luigi. Look, if you don't play the video games you shouldn't even watch this movie, it's purely a movie made for fans. Yes, it could have been alot better if they actually had the Mario creator direct it but in all truth, I think they did a good job of creating a Mario Brothers movie that one can actually watch for 90 mins. I mean I couldn't think of another way to actually create a watchable Mario world. And as for missing characters in the movie...well I'm sure they planned on adding that later in the movie series. The producers who fronted the money for this movie we're likely fans of the Mario series, because I'm sure they knew this wasn't going to be a big hit beyond video game fans.
You have to keep in mind this was early in the video game conversion to movie attempts. I mean Double Dragon is almost the same thing but with similar appeal. (And isn't that kid from Party of Five in that movie? Yes I believe so....) If you didn't play the games you'd have no interest in these movies. I mean maybe nowadays people just hate happy and cute movies. The movie is really meant for kids and fans of the series, beyond that you'll probably be upset and lost searching for some deep meaning IN THE MARIO BROTHERS FILM? If I had the money I'd produce a sequel just for the fans, (and yes, movies do get made just for fans sometimes...after all, what did you think Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back was?) And if I ever get the money, I WILL make a sequel. Just so there can be a movie with Toad in it. (I mean wouldn't you love to see a guy run around with a big Toad on his head?) I can't think of a director who would have any interest in creating a sequel to this movie.... but maybe one day.... come on its been ten years... on sequel couldn't hurt too much could it?

94,baz_trinity,Horrible,1,19 November 2006,"Before watching this, I couldn't possibly fathom on how a Mario movie COULDN'T capture at least some of the Mario magic and fun of the games, but somehow, this movie managed to pull off the near-impossible by making it completely on the contrary to ANY of the classic Mario games, and here's how.The characters, set designs, plot and atmosphere was just awful. Goombas were about 3 times the size of Mario and yet in the games you're supposed to be able to jump on their heads. Bo-bomb was frickin' wind-up toy, Toad was a busking hobo that ends up in prison, Luigi and Mario rarely wear there classic red and green and the girlfriends of the two were more like hookers than princesses (Not to mention there was no sign of peach). The set designs were just plain wrong. Dark, set at night mostly, a city feel and an all-round depressing atmosphere. For mario fans you will remember blue skies, green grass, happy music and a joyous atmosphere. Don't expect this here. What I'm trying to say is that this is as un-Mario as you can get and I really don't know what bright spark thought up the terrible ideas.If I wasn't a Mario fan or indeed had never played the games, it would still be just an awful movie. In fact, being a Mario fan I was more bias towards the movie, not wanting it to be a disaster like it unfortunately ended up to be.Avoid at all costs.",Super Mario Bros.

The reason why I think it wasn't received well with viewers was because they expected it to be much more similar the video games, but I personally believe it's admirable the way it is.  The acting is marvelous (especially Dennis Hopper), the set designs are amazing (the dark Dinohatten city was very atmospheric), and it succeeds (and surpasses) what it was meant to do: present an action-packed (albeit humorous) adventure.And to all of the disgruntled Mario fans out there that think the movie ""could have been so much better than it was"":  you should just accept it for the engaging, whimsical, action-packed journey that it is.

99,eric20other2002,Sorry...No More Lives Mario...,4,21 February 2007,"As a Super Mario Brothers fan I was stoked when I saw the trailer for this film(this was during the Super Mario World/Super Nintendo phase). So when I saw the film, I was a bit disappointed, but as a fan I still watched it. Some ideas were good to bring to life(for instance why is Dennis Hopper not a lizard?). I guarantee you that the problem with the film wasn't the acting. I think Bob Hoskins, John Leguizamo and Dennis Hopper were perfect choices, but the production. After reading the John Leguizamo book(he said he almost quitted acting, because of how rough this film was), I was right. Originally the film was written for adults and would've been given a PG-13 or R-rating, but the studio quickly decided it should be a family film. This films best quality is it's soundtrack, due to the fact the actors really had no structure to work with, its sad really. If they make another film I would say to bring the original concept back.Basically the premise is: King Koopa(in human form)is looking for the Princess so he can get his hands on a meteorite piece that will bring his world and our world together(like it once was) and takeover both worlds. After kidnapping the Princess the Mario Brothers who just met Daisy goes to save her, with the help from some curious rebels(like Big Bertha and a human Toad) It also features Lance Henricksen as the de-evolved King of the Mushroom Kingdom.So ONLY if your a fan of the video games you should see it. My best recommendation is to either watch it from a friends copy or wait for it to come on TV and record it.",Super Mario Bros.

The jokes may have been humorous back when the film first premiered, but they have certainly showed their age when viewing it again now. I honestly don't see why people try to defend this movie. It just isn't even close to being labeled decent in my book. There just isn't much to say about the Super Mario Bros movie besides just saying to skip it.

I looked every time I stumbled upon a BlockBuster store, and there it was. The Mario movie, waiting there for me. Two hours later, I was amazed. Luckily I was just a child, for now I look back and realize what a bad movie it really was. No Bowser , no princess Toadstool, no guy with a mushroom on his head, and no budget. It surprised me that it had such a low gross, but now I am not.

103,nintendofanof1993,Just watch it for yourself.,4,13 February 2011,"I could not believe how bad this movie was compared to the game. However I thought it was interesting, as in an interesting adaptation of the NES game. But the movie just could not hold up. It seemed to drag on for longer than it should have, and it seemed rushed. The intro is just wrong, it starts off as animated and the animation itself is jerky and scratchy. Then the film states that dinosaurs used to rule the world, which is true; but then it states the idea of the possibility of another dimension in which the dinosaurs thrived. Well that certainly was interesting, but it just did not feel like Super Mario Brothers. But then again I had to watch this movie with an open mind. So as we all know Mario is the older brother, and Luigi is the younger brother. The movie brought a good adaptation of the two but then the movie progressed. I noticed how Mario wore a green jacket but had a red shirt, and also noticed that Luigi had a green hat, but a red shirt on. The colors just felt a little mixed to me. So then we meet Princess Daisy...well wait a minute, wasn't the point of Super Mario Bros. to play as Mario and rescue Princess ""Peach""? It just astounds me how they could have messed that up. So more useless plot filler happens and then Luigi winds up asking Daisy out on a date, but not just a date a double date with Mario. Now I reveal this little bit of the movie for one main reason...Daisy tells the two brothers that she never really knew her family after being questioned by the rock around her neck. She also states that she was abandoned and left at an orphanage. So then Luigi shocked goes into detail about how Mario has always been there for him and then he states basically that Mario had raised him and been his ""Father"", his ""Mother"", etc. It just blows my mind. So basically what this movie is claiming is that Mario and Luigi are not brothers, but Father and Son? This just is incredible. Back to the overall movie, The Academy Award Winning Actor, Dennis Hopper played ""Bowser"" or King Koopa in this movie, and I have to say it was an interesting choice, but it just did not work for me. There is only so much Hopper could do to try to make the character work, but he just cannot accomplish this goal. Yoshi also makes an appearance but it was just a disappointment so I shall not go into that. All and all this movie is just a disgrace, its interesting I agree, but other than that, its awful. The perspective is just odd, and the characters do not portray the characters in the game even half as good as they should have. It just seems rushed and half-baked. This movie should have given us insight into the Super Mario Brothers, this movie should have been for the fans, and yet its just another failure. I do not recommend this movie at all, I do however recommend it for the fans, as they will be sure to get a kick out of it. Anyone else, just avoid this movie at all costs because it is certainly not worth your time.",Super Mario Bros.
104,Drake_Clawfang,Well...What did you expect?,7,30 March 2006,"Okay, this was based on a VI-DE-O GAME! Look at how most of the movies based on games have turned out! If you think this movie was lame, well again, what were you expecting, Titanic? Leo DiCaprio? Well, as it is, this movie, apart from characters and references, isn't that much like the Mario games. But hey, the games were pretty much Mario/Luigi jumping on giant turtles, and various other things. So hey, like that would work as a movie! Considering what they had to work with, they did a good job here.See, we all know that the dinosaurs went extinct some 65 million years ago when a huge meteorite struck Earth, right? Wrong! When the meteorite hit, it created a parallel dimension, and the dinos continue to evolve into human-like beings. Now, for the most part, Dino Land was a fun place. Then Koopa developed the power to 'de-evolve' things. He wasted no time in de-evolving the King into primordial fungus, and making himself dictator. Anyone who opposes him gets de-evolved into a Goomba. Now, under Koopa's rule, 20 years later, Dino Land is in a bad way. Few resources, limited food, fungus everywhere, and robbery and thievery run rampant. Good thing King K. has a plan to bail out his little town.See, when he took power 2 decades ago, the Queen fled to a vortex that leads from Dino Land to Brooklyn. She took with her an egg (reptiles, remember?) containing her child, Daisy. The Queen dies sealing the vortex, but luckily, the kid is entrusted to some nuns. With the egg comes a tiny shard of crystal. See, the meteorite that slammed Earth so many years ago is in Dino Lan. This crystal is a shard of it that broke off on impact, protected by the royal family. And guess what? If it were to be inserted back into the meteorite, the dimensions would merge together. Problem is, the energy that would be released upon insertion would be enormous, and only a member of the royal family would be able to withstand it. Getting Koopa's plan here? You guessed it: snag the shard, kidnap Daisy, merge the dimensions, de-evolve us, and take over our world. Boom, Dino Land's problems are solved! And yeah, Mankind will be a bunch of apes and monkeys, but Lizardkind will be living on easy street, so too bad for us!Not the best filmyou'll ever see, but a fun little gig. Just try and spot all the in-game references here! Yoshi, Super Mushrooms, the Goombas...the garbage men wear masks that resemble Snifits, and the cops, I believe in one scene, are referred to as Koopa Troopers. Big Bertha? Like the Cannon-like enemy in Super Mario RPG? Notice the Bullet-Bill like cartridges that power the Stomper Shoes? Or did you catch that sign over the tunnel that read 'Koopahari Desert?' I personally loved the final battle against Koopa, mirroring the boss battles in Mario Brothers (Koopa vs. Mario on a bridge, shooting fireballs) and Super Mario World (Koopa suspended overhead in his bucket). A pity Magikoopa couldn't have been fit in somewhere. And I would have liked to see Koopa's Airship. But hey, what can ya do? I would have also liked to have seen a sequel, but since it's been 10 years, probably not. Oh well. Take this film as it is: watch it, and have fun.",Super Mario Bros.

106,amanfigo,SMB has its strong points and its slack points.,6,16 January 2003,"In the first place, if we notice, the movie has the same plot of the video game: the Mario brothers travels to a parallel world, populated by mushrooms and dinosaurs, where they have to save the princess of the evil King Bowser Koopa. The movie contains excellent performances like that of Bob Hoskins, brilliant as Mario (the best in the film) and the interpretation of Dennis Hopper (King Koopa). Although I think that the paper of Koopa should have him fact a stouter actor because, in the video game, Koopa is much bigger the Mario brothers.  Other papers like that of Luigi, interpreted as John Leguizamo that doesn't make it bad but it should have him fact an actor a little more mature than it seemed that it was Mario's brother (it is that Leguizamo seems more Mario's son that his brother!!), as for the princess Daisy, embodied by Samantha Mathis, is quite well but physically she was not very similar to the princess of the video game. The rest of secondary characters of the film is exceptional and they make reference to the video game like they are Lenna, Iggy, Toad, Big Bertha, Goombas... although I believe that they have left the poor person of Yoshi some side.It is also necessary the devices that appear in the movie making reference in the video game to highlight like: the mushroom (that enlarges, it protects Mario of the shots and it shrinks again), Bob-Ombs (as those of SMB3 although a little smaller), the fire balls (propelled with the help of guns), the mushrooms or the king Mushroom (that make the function that make the blocks in the video game in the video game, of to provide objects and to help Mario and Luigi), the Stomper Boots (that make that Mario and Luigi fly or to carry out the big jumps like in SMB) or the devolution machine. The great majority of these apparatuses makes that the film has a realistic touch and futurist making that the history you already developed beyond those typical histories of the video game (mushrooms, Koopa Troopa, pipes, etc...). In general that with a good cast (Hoskins, Hopper...), the same plot of the video game, a numberless of objects and enemies (taken out of the video games, ""recycled"" or added for enjoyment of the movie) and an excellent sound band (Alan Silvestri and the ""Almost Unreal"" of Roxette) they make that Super Mario Bros is a movie of two hours with assured entertainment, based on the most popular video game in the world. Although Super Mario Bros any Oscar has not gotten the movie it is very well. And for the many critics that think that this movie is very bad I tell them... Is not reason happened to take a look to movies like Street Fighter? for sure it will be faithful to the video game! No?.",Super Mario Bros.

Mario and Luigi are cartoon-game-characters in a colorful and cute universe.

The only creature I liked was Yoshi. And who's Daniella? Where's Peach? And I thought King Koopa was some sort of Turtle, not a Dinosaur, the dinosaur is Yoshi. And Toad is a guy with a mushroom head, not a human with weird hair and that sings weird songs on the street like a hobo! Finally, the main thing i have with this is, WHERE IS LUIGI'S MUSTACHE!?

Luigi is in love with her, so normally, he goes after her with his brother...or father...or friend...Mario.Dennis Hopper plays Bowser (king Koopa in the movie), and he's not good at it.

111,Glorback,"Interesting ideas, but not very good delivery.",6,19 February 2006,"I think this movie gets more criticism than it deserves. It's honestly not THAT terrible.I gotta say, when I was pretty young and saw it, it was quite a shock to see lush green plains replaced with a degenerate city unrivaled by even the worst areas of New York, and to see a slimy weird lizard where the happy-go-lucky Yoshi we all know and love would be, not to mention tiny walking mushrooms with mean faces replaced with some of the freakiest looking gargantuan humanoid monsters I've ever seen. Obviously, the movie has very little in common with the games in terms of appearance. However, the concept basically remains the same. Mario and Luigi set out to rescue the princess from Bowser/Koopa (who is also nothing like the giant monster he was in the games).When I was young, my surprise overshadowed my understanding of the movie. Now that I'm older and have seen it again, I can better appreciate some of the good ideas it offered, and put aside comparisons with the games.The story of origin is very interesting. I found the whole idea of dimensions split into a world of people evolved from apes and a world of people evolved from dinosaurs to be quite unique. Also, I liked the ideas of the evolution machine and the ubiquitous living fungus. Of course, for good ideas in movies to work, they must be delivered well. In a lot of ways, Super Mario Bros does not succeed in this.The acting is actually pretty poor. Bob Hoskins and Dennis Hopper do an OK job, but John Leguiazamo and Samantha Mathis not so much. The bumbling Iggy and Spike deliver their lines much in the same way that people in high school plays do. You can't really take the actions of the actors very seriously, even at times when one is supposed to. The love subplot between Luigi and Daisy is done very poorly. If the director tried to make it seem less serious, it would have been OK, but he tries and fails to make the audience feel it is genuine. Also, some of the ""humour"" almost makes you cringe, and is pretty hackneyed. Consult the quote section for some examples.These flaws aside, I still found this movie enjoyable enough to watch all the way through. If you're afraid of wasting money on a rental, then wait for it to come on TV.",Super Mario Bros.

114,JodyBruchon,"An excellent movie that is a victim of its branding, timing, and notoriety",8,14 January 2017,"I did not have the luxury of seeing this in my youth, but I did watch it in early adulthood out of curiosity and my memories of that experience were worth rating it 6 out of 10. However, after watching a review of the movie by James Rolfe, I was inspired to watch it again and set aside my prejudices stemming from the notorious reputation of badness this movie drags behind it. It was an eye-opening experience.Super Mario Bros. is a very good movie that became scorned in the public eye because of its association with the video game of the same title and being essentially the first major motion picture based on a video game. It also had the misfortune of being preceded by the Super Mario Bros. Super Show which has a very different format and probably set up a lot of unfair expectations as to what a Mario movie would be like. If we examine the Super Mario Bros. video game with the lens of a person craving a story, we find that there isn't much to go on. The plot is ""a plumber saves a princess from a reptilian monster in a castle"" and that's it. There are precious few details beyond that. The various enemies and objects and characters only exist for the purpose of enabling the game mechanics to function. Everything in the video game lacks any sort of deeper meaning; the only unifying elements (and I use that term somewhat loosely) are mushrooms, turtles, and pipes. What else could you expect from an 8-bit era platforming game? My point is this: as an inspiration for a full-blown story, the video game is effectively a one-sentence writing prompt. It shouldn't be a surprise that a Super Mario Bros. live-action movie is based largely on interpretation of the vague elements offered up in the video game. For the rest of the review, let's set aside the video game and focus on the movie as an independent work.Super Mario Bros. has all the elements of a great family-friendly action/fantasy movie. Two everyday normal guys trying to make a living stumble into events that toss up their normal lives and they wind up in a dystopian place. There are elements of sci-fi and film noir that are executed very well, but the film also never takes itself too seriously and the comedy is always around to lighten things up. In a lot of ways, this film is reminiscent of Who Framed Roger Rabbit, a work that is arguably one of the best movies ever made. There are obvious inspirations from other classics such as Blade Runner and Mad Max.It's not without its flaws, of course. There are some dull or just plain stupid moments that could have been cut down or omitted. Luigi's character sometimes acts in ways that have no believable motivation for doing so, even by the loose standards of a fantasy story in a family film. There are a lot of interesting elements that go unexplained which is a bit disappointing. There is a large set of people that are supposed to be vastly different but really just look like plain old humans in tasteless outfits and funny hairstyles (I can't explain in any more detail without spoilers but you'll know who I'm referencing when you get there) which is even more ridiculous because there is yet another closely related set of people that DO actually look different.Fortunately, the flaws don't detract very much from the overall enjoyment of the film. It's actually a lot of fun to look for the references to the elements from the video game; some are in-your-face obvious while some are subtle enough that you probably won't catch them the first time you watch the movie.I was surprised by this ""bad movie."" It was a lot more fun to watch than its reputation would have us all believe. If it hadn't been tied to such a vague video game and had to follow in the footsteps of the Super Show, this could have easily become a classic family film from the early 1990s. Many other reviewers claim to have enjoyed it in spite of its reputation and I'm happy to join them.",Super Mario Bros.
115,RBlake77,Better than they say...,7,15 August 2012,"A lot of people say ""Super Mario Bros."" is a bad movie, because it wasn't a faithful adaptation of the video game. Well those people can go suck an egg. I loved this movie when I first saw it in theatres way back in 1993, and I love it now.As for the story, it's essentially the same as the video game; the Mario Bros. try to rescue the princess from Koopa. But instead of a brightly lit Mushroom Kingdom full of walking mushrooms and flying turtles, we have a dark and gritty dystopia.Koopa is after a piece of rock that is part of a meteorite that struck the Earth some 65 million years ago and thrust the dinosaurs into a parallel dimension, where the dinosaurs eventually took on a humanoid form, in much the same way that Earth humans evolved from apes. Uniting this piece of rock with the rest of the meteorite would unite the two dimensions, and allow Koopa to enter into our dimension, devolve humans into apes and take over, because our world is cleaner, has abundant food and clean water. And the Mario Bros. ain't having none of that and try to stop him. Throughout the movie there are references to the video games (Big Bertha, B-bomb, etc.), so it's all good.And you really can't blame the writers for wanting to try something different with the Marios, since a literal live action adaptation of the video game wouldn't translate well to film.

Samantha Mathis is acceptable in her role as Princess Toadstool. I mean Daisy. And I have to admit that Bob Hoskins and Dennis Hopper are acceptable in their respective roles as Mario and Koopa. My point is that the problem isn't the acting. This is a terrible, terrible movie that should never have been made, but given that it IS being made, the four stars do an acceptable job.The problem is with almost everything else in the movie. This is one of those movies where things have been crammed in there because they seemed like cool concepts. There is no attempt to base actions in reality and there is no effort to infuse the script with logic. There is a strange, dark undertone to the movie, which can be very interesting (Blade Runner) but here it just seems cheap. Combined with the fungus, it looks like they could only afford a studio BASEMENT and just incorporated it into the movie. I don't know if this was intended to be a funny kiddie movie, or a kiddie action movie, or a dark adult movie, or what. All I got out of it was that it is an idiotic plumber-fest with stupid technology and an insultingly simple plot. Allow me to reiterate: THIS IS A BAD MOVIE.",Super Mario Bros.

I was blown away with how horribly bad it was.  I was also amazed on how much i remembered being in the movie that wasnt.  so as the title says be careful how you watch.

Over 50 Games featured these characters. Then in 1993, they were popular, but the movie should have waited.I think a remake in the Future would work. The actors did good, the story was not like the original though. It was not Mario enough. They tried to fit it into the real world and they failed!Other then that, it was not a bad movie.

122,prufrock5150,Marred Mario Bothers...,1,15 January 2012,"So, *this* is what the movie of a SMB game should've looked like: Mario and Luigi, two lovable, Laurel-and-Hardy-esque plumbers from New York, take a job that involves a large, green pipe. By some unfortunate accident, they fall into the opening... only to emerge in a lush, flowering land full of verdant views and large, Alice-in-Wonderland-ish mushrooms. After meeting Toad, an ebullient native of this strange land, they learn that their princess has been kidnapped by a large, spiky-shelled creature named King Koopa. Vowing to earn their return to the home they know by rescuing this princess, Mario and Luigi overcome both the natural challenges of the environment of the Mushroom Kingdom as well as the attempts by Koopa's minions to thwart their advance. After overcoming the tests of mettle and might, and finding their way through labyrinthine castles, Koopa is defeated and the princess is found.See now, how hard was that? The game *itself* has pretty much everything you need to make a movie about it... sure, you'd need some witty dialogue and an awful lot of special effects, but it's nothing that, say, *43 MILLION DOLLARS* couldn't do.What you *don't* need are spurious and inane spring-loaded-rocket-jumping shoes, unnecessary connections to *wildly inaccurate* representations of evolutionary theory, awkward attempts to smoosh poor representations of unimportant baddies from every game into an hour and a half, or Dennis Hopper. They can jump high because it's a parallel universe, goombas are just creatures that evolved from whatever other creatures there were millions of years ago in that universe, and King Koopa is giant, spiky-shelled thing that looks *absofreakinglutely nothing* like Dennis Hopper. No, a spiky blond dye job on your head does not make you look like an evil reptilian tyrant - and it doesn't take the place of a shell.Sadly, the Super Mario Bros. Movie makes the same mistake that virtually every other video-game movie has made: it flagrantly and arbitrarily makes stuff up that not only doesn't have *anything* to do with the game, but furthermore seems to perversely go so far off-course from the fun and adventurous tone of its source material as to make my childhood memories grit their teeth and softly weep.",Super Mario Bros.
123,mcalester66,Could Have Been Better,5,5 March 2013,"I can only describe ""Super Mario Bros"" the movie in one word.RIDICULOUS! The story is set in 90s Brooklyn - at first. The story follows the hysterical theory that the dinosaurs continue to thrive in another dimension. When Luigi Mario meets the girl of his dreams, his - and his brother Mario's - lives are turned upside down. They are sucked into this other dimension, where people eat lizards on hot dogs and buildings are consumed in fungus.The film holds many aspects of the video game series, including fungus swallowing up the kingdom, bob-ombs, bullet bills, spring loaded shoes, flame throwers, etc, with some visual gags, such as the ""Wiggler"" taxi, and the ""Thwomp Club."" References to Mario Kart, and Super Mario 64 are also made, in high-speed car chases, and icy rides down frozen tunnels.The most disappointing thing in this film was King Koopa (Bowser now-a-days)who did not even look like the character. His acting was dry and very Mel-Brookes esq.In the end, I gave this film 5/10 stars because I liked the idea, but I did not like how it was pulled off. This film could have gone places. It's a pity, considering how many Mario fans walked away feeling cheated out of short of two hours.5/10",Super Mario Bros.

To go into details would be extremely unpleasant; suffice it to say that this movie fails on almost EVERY conceivable level, and maybe a few INconceivable ones.And yes, I DID grow up with the games. I LOVED the games. The original ""Super Mario Bros."" game was my introduction into the wondrous world of Nintendo, and I went on to obsessively play all of its sequels. Which makes it even more apparent to me just how pathetic the movie's attempts to shoehorn in elements of the game are. Also, I have never been more embarrassed for Bob Hoskins and Dennis Hopper. I give this movie a 2 out of 10. The only thing - the ONLY thing - that keeps it from falling into ""Robot Holocaust"" territory is the somewhat interesting sets.

Yoshi's portrayal was acceptable apparently the fact that he was ether a dinosaur or a dragon or perhaps both even had the directors confused as it did fans and non fans alike.

No, it doesn't look like Mario at all. How come, I will explain in the other reasons why I despise this movie below.2. There are no koopas. Koopas are turtles, not humans.3. No Toads. In the movie, the Toad is an entire mushroom. In the games, toads are little humans with mushroom heads on.4. WHERE THE HELL IS PRINCESS TOADSTOOL?! Princess Toadstool is in the games, but not in the movie? I mean, WTF?5. In the movie, there is no castle. There is just nothing but a city in America.6. The Mario brothers are from Italy because they're Italian, not from Brooklyn, New York. 7. There are no Goompas. Goompas are evil mushrooms that walk.8. Bowser is not in the movie. Like I said, it's Koopa. 9. The plot doesn't make any sense.10. In the games, Yoshi is a dinosaur. He's a T-rex mixed with a brontosaurus. In the movie, he is a T-rex that's it. No mixture. 11. Mario doesn't ride on Yoshi in the movie, WTF? 12. The bombs are too tiny in the movie. They also have winders, and they don't have these in the games.13. There are no prize boxes.14.

129,mellowo,Disgrace to the video games and Nintendo should be ashamed for letting this THING get released,2,12 February 2016,"Another movie that popped up into my brain that I decided to critique, since I've finally gotten around to movie reviews, is the Super Mario Bros. movie. I have childhood memories of playing the video games and I just found out a couple of years ago that a movie was actually released based off of the video games. I watched the film and it sucked. Let me tell you why.The plot of this is sort of like the Super Mario Bros. games. It follows the basic premise of the games where there are 2 Italian plumbers and they need to go rescue a princess, but the movie does this sort of plot in a different way to what the video games did it. In the video games it had Mario jumping on goombas, parakoppers and all sorts of enemies. In the film it has stuff like the brothers being sent to jail, Mario biting a woman's chest (and yes that actually happens in the film) and instead of a huge reptilian creature capturing the princess, we have Dennis Hopper in a business suit who repeatedly says he's a lizard sort of descendant capturing descendant. So yeah the plot doesn't exactly follow the game entirely but at least it got the basic premise correct, sort of.The main problem I have with this film is that it has little to nothing to do with Super Mario Bros. The only thing it has to do with the Super Mario Bros. is that the characters have the same names as the video game characters. If you decided to change the name of the characters, it could easily pass off as a completely different movie than the Super Mario Bros. Even the actors don't look much like the video game characters and I also have a few issues with the casting choices. Bob Hoskins is playing Mario and I'm going to say that he is probably the only actor that looks sort of like the video game counterpart he was meant to be. John Leguizamo is playing Luigi. OK there are a few problems I have with Leguizamo playing Luigi. One, Bob Hoskins is a British actor so I think it should have been common sense to get another British actor and not a Latino. Two, he doesn't have a moustache. You can't deny the Mario brothers' moustaches are a pretty prominent feature and Leguizamo doesn't have one. There is also Dennis Hopper who plays koopa. I know that in the 90s Dennis Hopper was the prominent actor to get if you want a villain in the movie, but could they at least make him look like koopa? He's still a human. Last I checked, koopa was a great big huge dinosaur esque reptilian creature, not a human businessman. They don't even get the female lead correct. You know how in the games that princess peach is the female lead in the games? Well she isn't in this one as she is replaced by Princess Daisy, from the super Mario land games on game boy.If casting is bad that's one thing how is the acting. A lot of people seem to criticise the acting in Super Mario Bros. but I'm going to make an exception for one actor and that's Bob Hoskins. He is great, even if he possibly wasn't a good cast choice he still put on a relatively good performance. Everyone else gives off bad acting and every scene feels like they're awkwardly trudging through the bad writing.One thing that I will say I like in the movie is the effects. Some of the effects that were used in this still hold up well today.The cinematography is also a thing that I like about this film but I also dislike it. Let me explain. It's good cinematography, but it's not fitting for the film. I love looking at this dark world that's in this film but the whole idea of the settings in super Mario Bros. was that their worlds were bright, colourful and happy. This setting seems to have had a more dark setting to it. So for cinematography in general, it's great but for the tale it's trying to tell, it's bad.Music for this film is bland, boring and unimaginative. The only thing that I remember sticking out in the music department is the video game theme at the opening. Everything else is just dull, boring, unimaginative and forgettable.The main thing that goes wrong for this movie is that it doesn't follow it's source material that well. As well as that nearly everything else falls flat. The plot has this dark tone that kids might not really enjoy, especially to the ones that have played the video games and are used to the happy tones set by the games. The cinematography while good, isn't fitting to what sort of tale they're telling. The tone is really unnecessarily dark. The musical score is boring and forgettable. The acting given off from all of the actors is bad, with the exception of Bob Hoskins. Stay clear.",Super Mario Bros.

133,tlso1987,"For so much directing, it's a lot better than it could've been",8,21 February 2010,"I loved this movie as a kid. More recently, I've learned just how much of a living Hell the production was. Evidently the directors wanted it as a totally dark Blade Runner-style flick while the producers tried to change things. To their credit, the producers weren't exactly insane trying to market an adaptation of a kids' game to kids.For the most part, the actors don't seem as miserable as they say they were throughout shooting (actually I hear Dennis Hopper and Fiona Shaw had a blast playing the villains).Again to the staff's credit, a live-action feature based on a video game was a pretty new thing, and while Mario Bros looks, on the surface, nothing like the game, some players will recognize parallels and hidden references in the script and scenery. Finally, the production design of this movie is amazing. There are so many little details in the sets and props, it's actually hard to separate this movie from other big scifi films of the time.Give this movie a shot, and you may be pleasantly surprised.",Super Mario Bros.

The new Blu-ray is one of the best releases from 2014 by Second sight, featuring a stunning new transfer (better than a depressing number of all- time classics), and a hugely enjoyable new making-of documentary. Fans in the US may be disappointed the disc is locked to Region B, but anyone with a compatible player who enjoys the movie should not hesitate to pick up a copy. Highly recommended.Rocky Morton and Annabelle Jankel's Dinohattan doesn't stray too far from dystopias like Blade Runner (in fact, production designer David L. Snyder worked on both films), but there's something infectious about seeing filmmakers allowed to reinvent source material with such wild abandon. The Goombas are no longer mushrooms but gigantic lizard men decked out in burgundy war regalia. Snyder embraces the industrial look of the film's real-life shooting locale with metal walkways, dangling power cords, and neon lighting curling around gray concrete pillars. Even the Koopahari desert is filled with strange, anonymous men in hazmat-style suits driving ""sludge tankers"" filled with garbage bags. All of these settings are also draped in the fungus, a string-cheese-like substance that occasionally offers power-ups to the heroes, including the iconic Bob-omb. A fun score by Alan Silvestri adds another layer of cohesion. The Super Mario Bros. movie is a good adaptation of the video game, it has a darker grittier slant than the game which.works better, good movie, it's certainly a memorable one, an ambitious failure that's far more inventive and interesting than 10 more faithful failed video game adaptation.",Super Mario Bros.
136,strife82,"It's not the game, but I'm sure that was the point...",6,27 October 2005,"OK...I'll get it out of the way. Yes, I know this isn't based EXACTLY off the game, yes I know the writing isn't the greatest, yes I know this movie bombed...but in all honesty I don't really care. For what it is, I thought this was a nice, zany, and slightly action-packed movie that I found pretty entertaining. It wasn't based exactly off the movie, and I think that's what gives it a good sense of originality. It's for that reason, at least, partly, why I'm sure it didn't sell well. Too many people expected the same color, same saccharine kiddie-fare, pretty much a full-on big screen rendition of the game. What they got was a movie, gritty, dark, and original instead. And that's a main reason I like it as it is.It had the basics down; two plumbers from Brooklyn, Mario and Luigi, going into an alternate universe to save a princess in peril and stop a megalomaniac from wreaking havoc. In the games, as good as they are, it was basically the same situation, not too much difference in terms of delivery. The games had Koopa vying for power and dominance. In the movie, he already has it, and his power usurped everything to the point where his hunger grew well past the point of what he perceived as reality (he wanted to conquer Earth as well). Boasting a slightly all-star cast (how they got Bob Hoskins to do Mario is past me), and, as stated earlier, a grittier and darker look, it seemed as if the movie itself could appeal to both kids and adults alike.I did enjoy how some of the aspects for Mario and Luigi's powers were explained in a bit more realistic terms (I doubt a fat plumber could naturally jump fifteen feet in the air...). The jump boots, the fire-ball launchers, even the wicked bob-bomb, were written in as more artificial, albeit a bit more believable, powers to be at their disposal. The only real drawbacks I saw was that the writing could've been a bit tweaked, as well as some of the direction (it had two directors Mr. Hoskins absolutely hated, so I'm guessing something was amiss). But as it is, I found this movie enjoyable and fun, and I'd definitely watch it again. Obsessive gamers need not apply (you'd hate this movie, I'm sure of it).",Super Mario Bros.

before I start with this one, I have to say that it was hard to decide if I should review this movie in a sincere or an ironic way. You just can not watch ""Super Mario Bros."" in a serious and expectant mindset. It has so many parts and decisions which seem so silly that you might assume the filmmakers did not take the film serious as well.If we look at this movie as a video game adaptation, there is no way around to not slam it in a dustbin to all the other attempts to adapt a video game into decent film.Just the way the ""Mushroom Kingdom"" and its characters were portrayed feels like one big parody of the Super Mario Franchise (which is not even a complete bad thing).Nevertheless you have to admit that this film is pretty entertaining and makes some good laughs. This has certainly to do with its trashiness, but one can still not negate that.I for my part had a blast watching ""Super Mario Bros."", but I am still trying to figure out if it was BECAUSE or DESPITE it was so bad. I rate it 4 stars, regarding the fact it lets every heart bleed of those who are even only a little bit attached to the Super Mario games.

Well, ok, let's just pretend it went just like the game. A plumber would appear magically in a land of mushrooms for no apparent reason, step on a couple of shoe wearing brown midgets, kick a couple of flying turtles into the afterlife, then walk into a castle, to find a pudgy little man that says, ""Well, Mario, you're screwed, she's not here."" And then we'd repeat for another 3 hours. Sure we'd have to throw in a goofy turtle that breathes fire every half hour, just to keep the realism. C'mon people! I'm glad it went NOTHING like the game.What this movie did was take the story line, and then add in a little more. The comedy was great, and the action was wonderful. Who doesn't love Bob Hoskins and John Leguizamo in tool belts fighting evil mutants? I personally found the movie fun, and hilarious. I'm just sorry that the heartless critics out there didn't feel the same.9/10 stars.",Super Mario Bros.
147,amazon-comshopper,Awful......just awful!,1,4 December 2018,This movie is and will always will be a blemish that has tarnished video game movies and gave it a horrible stigma! This movie should just be buried out of existence! This is why Halo was never brought to the big screen! I have hopes for Super Mario Bros. The Movie.,Super Mario Bros.
148,whatsyourboggle,An oft maligned hidden gem,8,9 September 2021,"The tl;dr is ""this movie is really fun, and worth watching, despite its reputation."" But what are movie reviews but gushing pretentiously persevering? XDAlright, you know this movie, you've heard about it being one of the worst movies ever made, you've seen it blamed for the standard of video game movie adaptations, but I watched it again last night for the first time since I rented it on VHS in 1993, and I realised something.This movie freaking RULES!It has a reputation but I really think it was down to several unfortunate factors, and no real fault of the movie itself. Mario at the time was the biggest video game property in the world, the hype was enormous. And the truth is the movie is nothing like the game. That leaves people disappointing. But please let me tell you about this movie.What stands out to me is how they took a very simple premise - run to the right, avoid obstacles, save the princess - and expanded it into ... well words fail me. This is a whole world. It feels a little like the underground parts of Demolition Man, or Blade Runner, there's a kind of dystopian cyberpunk edge to it.The villain, played with apparently great pleasure by Dennis Hopper, legend, is hammed up to the max, and it gives me great joy, one of my favourite things in campy movies is seeing serious actors getting to ham it up (see Jack Nicholson's superb and hilarious Joker in Batman(1989) for another example of what I mean when a dramatic actor gets to cut loose) His motivations are fairly standard villain fare, he wants to rule the universe of course, but they actually introduce some of Koopa's family like his cousins which is neat.The story is less incredible than the worldbuilding, but it's servicable. There's a maguffin, and the obstacles that prevent our intrepid brothers from reaching it feel fairly organic, and not just like they're trying to pad the film (even if that's the case, I don't know, but a lot of movies make it feel a lot more contrived than this)Princess Peach isn't in this one, but what's really cool is that Luigi is almost the star of the film, and follows HIS love interest instead of Mario and Peach. This might have also contributed to its poor reputation, Mario is the hero of the games, of course the damsel should be Peach! But no, this is Super Mario BROS, and they play beautifully together. I have no idea why they cast John Leguizamo as Luigi, but he and Bob Hoskins as Mario have a really enjoyable relationship, they feel like brothers :) They have different skills, and they each get their times to shine. I thought it was very well balanced, some movies with multiple protagonists struggle to give them an even shake.The music identifies this as an early/mid 90s movie, it has a light, sorta whimsical feel that wouldn't be out of place in Home Alone. It doesn't quite fit the aesthetic of the movie, but it provides a tone that I found appropriate. The main thing to know is this movie is absolutely BONKERS, and it doesn't only embrace it, it revels in it.I was bracing myself to hate this, of course I'I enjoyed it as a kid, I was 7, and it was Mario, my standards weren't high, but having studied film for a while now and been an avid movie lover with what many would call unrealistic standards, I finished this movie feeling really good. Great. I was still laughing, there was some emotional content but it felt a little tacked on and didn't make as strong an impact as it could have, but I class this as a feelgood romp of a movie.OH! The story! I know I said it was less incredible than the worldbuilding but friends I was wrong, I'd just forgotten about it! The premise: meteor hits Earth and wipes out the dinosaurs, yeah? But what if it didn't? What if it created a dimensional rift that sucked the dinosaurs through? And what if they lived the intervening millennia in that other dimension, evolving to a comparable level to humans? And what if they found their way back? (this is the opening monologue that sets up the film, not spoilers) which I think is phenomenal. They could have gone into it more but they kept it simple at that outline..Anyway, this movie made me feel really good, I had a great time, and if you're curious, I really encourage you to check it out with an open mind, perhaps don't see it as a Mario movie at all, at least not as an adaptation of the game. Watch it as a standalone movie, compare it to nothing, and just enjoy, because it rocks :)",Super Mario Bros.

150,greasecapade,To video game nerds: Get a Life! It's a M-O-V-I-E!,8,7 May 2003,"I've seen this three or four times, and it's more fun each and every time. The cast is excellent.  Dennis Hopper?  Who could ask for a better villain? John Leguizamo keeps the idiot factor to a minimum... so on and so forth.The effects are a lot like the rest of the movie - FUN.  It's great to see a film where the effects are not a bunch of CG mumbo jumbo.  It's a fun all-ages sort of movie, and anyone who could watch this without a smile is taking the world far too seriously.It seems many of the reviewers here are complaining about the movie's poor adherenence to the video games.  Give me a break.  Ooh, let's make a feature film about a 2D sidescrolling platform game.

I've had 28 years worth of negative reviews to temper my excitement towards this movie and it finally wormed its way through my Netflix DVD queue.At first glance this is a downright awful movie that doesn't stand on its own. At first glance it doesn't even seem to try stick to the source material other than the names of the two leads. However, through the lens of the games and the technology of the time they did a very good job of trying to stay true. Granted, some artistic liberties were taken with some aspects, but when you sit down and follow their line of thinking you can see the logic, even if it's not what you would have done.",Super Mario Bros.

I remember I wanted the koopa guy/bowser to turn into bowser and look like him, but the result was disappointing. Also as a kid I was freaked out and scared if this movie, I mean those guys with the small heads, creepy! Obviously today a think it down right awful, but as a kid a enjoyed it in a way, but I would be disappointed at times, so even then it wasn't great, but it was enough for me to want to watch it when my older brother or sister was watching it.

(3 was my absolute favorite!) I loved watching the cartoons, like Mario Bros. Super Show, Mario 3, and Mario World, but man! This movie just did cut it for me! Such a terrible disaster! A big flop in Mario history. They think they succeeded with this movie, I think they totally failed and let a die hard Mario fan like me down terribly!!! Take my advise everyone and listen carefully because I'll only say this once ""Play the games and watch the cartoons!"" ""Forget about this disastrous, horrible film"" Maybe they should try making a Mario Bros. film like with CGI animation. It might help make a better Mario film.

155,SarkastikAssassin,Absolutely HILARIOUS,10,15 August 2018,"This movie is dumb. REALLY dumb. 
We're talking levels of dumb that shouldn't even exist. But yet, here we are.The people in this movie can not act. The editors can not edit. The writers can not write. And all of this failure cancels itself out, and makes something beautiful. This film.This movie had me smiling and laughing the whole way through. Almost NOTHING in this movie comes from the source material, the Super Mario Bros games. And I think that's another factor in why this movie is so great. As a huge Mario fan, there are even MORE faults to laugh at. Mario is like 20 years older then Luigi, Yoshi is just a little velociraptor, King Koopa is just a scary guy with a lizard tongue, the goombas are huge people with tiny lizard heads, there are like 4 characters that have no connection to the games whatsoever, it's just all so wrong, and yet, so perfect.And the real mystery to me is: Did the people who made the film know that?I guess we'll never know. But no matter, this movie is great. Watch it with your friends, watch it with your grandma, watch it with your dog, it's just the best.",Super Mario Bros.

It is a darn shame on how it is underrated, because many people hate this movie just because they think ""omgz itz not like the ghames!!1one"". Well, if it were like the games, it would have been to childish, don't you agree? This at least beats walking forward eating mushrooms and growing bigger for 1 and a half hours! The acting in this movie is fantastic and I admire all of the actor's work in the film. Special effects are amazing and this movie is really enjoyable if you watch it and totally forget about the game. Movies are supposed to extend plots to things anyway.

161,MerrittTheFerret,"All in all, an OK flick...",10,4 July 2006,"It was summer, 1997. I was just becoming a video gamer then, and when my Dad told me the Super Mario Bros Movie was on TV, I nearly had a lapse of sanity, I was like ""THERE'S A MOVIE?!"" And so I sat down and watched it. Then, I rented it endlessly. After which my parents finally bought me a VHS copy for Christmas in winter of '98. I have studied this movie to no end, I have watched it so many times I have lost count. But it's also not as bad as people make it out to be. Let's look at the facts.Mario is Italian, right? Mario is from Brooklyn, right?Well, they got half that right, getting a British actor (Hoskins) to play the part of Mario with a New York Accent. I thought that was OK, but in the long run, Mario should have been played by Danny DeVito. That's really the only person who could have played him, because DeVito's both Italian AND a New Yorker (at least, he acts like it...)Luigi is Italian, right? Luigi is from Brooklyn, right?Again, something they got half right. John Leguizamo, a young Hispanic man, to play the part of an Italian Plumber. At least John acts like a New Yorker, a convincing New Yorker, nonetheless, but not an Italian Plumber. Also, Luigi should have had a mustache, there's no excuse for him not having a mustache in that movie, but for some reason... Koopa. Koopa is a dinosaur.Okay, they totally blew this one, but hey, it was 1992 when they made the movie, for Chrissake! There was no such thing as CGI back then and even if there had been, we'd all complain to this day about 'How fake Bowser looked.' So they did the next best thing, they made Koopa a really mean politician, I can see the humor in that now...Daisy. Daisy is the Princess of Sarasaland.OK, they blew this one too, but here's the lowdown on Mario and the Princess, I don't know if you know this, but Mario doesn't go out with Peach in the games, he goes out with Pauline, the girl from Donkey Kong, an earlier model for Peach. But now, Pauline and Peach exist in the same plain, so there is no reason to have Mario have a relationship with a young princess when it can go to Luigi, a character that kids can relate to.Goombas. Goombas...Again, there was no CGI back in those days and even if there was it was very primitive (T2) and it could not have made the illusion of many little characters on screen. So they did the next best thing, they had over-sized (God knows why) zombie-like creatures who had once been members of the Mushroom Kingdom act out they're part, unfortunately, probably taking a lot of the budget up...And Finally, Toad. Toad, Toad, Toad...Toad is supposed to be a body guard of the princess, right? Well he's Peach's body guard, not Daisy's and he must have been out of a job or something in this movie because I have no idea why he was even in this film...I hope this helps you understand the Mario Bros Movie a little better. I like to think of it as ""Mario in Wario's World,"" which would've made a cool sequel, but again, the movie bombed at the box office... I have now, and always will enjoy this movie, but the flaws are hard to look past. But if you can manage to watch the movie and just have fun, then I salute you, because it's Mario, and everybody loves Mario, no matter what they say.UPDATE: After revisiting the world of the Mario Bros, I came to realize what made me fall in love with this movie in the first place... I don't know why, but I've always been attracted to this movie, it will always hold a special place in my heart and it's number 2 on my top ten list (With FIGHT CLUB being number 1.) When I was little, I watched this movie, over and over and over again until three in the morning every weekend until my parents split up... The reason I love it so much isn't because it's about my favorite video game character, or that it stars my favorite actors (Bob Hoskins, Dennis Hopper), but because it's a gritty, dark, violent balls to the wall science fiction movie. Even with a PG rating, this movie is ""PG-13"" by today's standards, lol But I know everything about this movie. The only thing is, I wish they'd come out with a special edition DVD with some special features, it is the FIRST movie to be based upon a video game, after all...All in all, there are only 2 things I'd change about this wonderful little movie...1. Luigi would have a mustache. 2. Mario Bros would be in Mario Bros Red and Green Uniforms whole movie.That's all I have to say, really, I can't express what a fun and entertaining movie this is, even if you don't think it's true to the video game (which it is, to a big extent), still watch it, and enjoy it as the most violent, gritty PG-Rated Science Fiction Film ever made.

Then, three years later, I saw Super Mario Bros. on the big screen.  Unlike I had imagined, it was nothing like the video game.  Poor special affects, and bad acting contributed to making this one of the worst movies ever made.  After I saw this film, I ran into my room, and cried into my bed.  (At the time, it had rocket ship blankets.) Anyway, I was obviously both hurt and befuddled that this was nothing like the beloved video game.  I stayed in my room for 11 days, (47 weeks) crying because it was so bad.

Could it have been done better yes, but it was a awesome movie. The goombas would have been stupid and laughable when you're making a sci-fi action flick if you made them look like they do in the game. King Koopa being human-ish does kinda suck. Mario's first Princess was Lady/Pauline in 1981. Princess Daisy appeared in 1989 Super Mario Land for the Game Boy and has been a regular since then. Princess Toadstool/Peach didn't appear until 1995. King Koopa/Bowser has a wife and multiple children and he's from Dinosaur Land. Toad is in the movie he's just human. Yoshi can't talk, he mumbles and a cartoon is OK if you're doing a cartoon. And You people call yourself a true Mario fans. Mario first appeared as the ""Jumpman"" in the 1981 version of ""Donkey Kong"" as a carpenter. Mario and Lugi didn't appear as brothers and plumbers until 1983 in ""Mario Bros"" where they fought creatures in New York. I am a true Mario Bros. fan, so don't insult me by saying this movie sucks beyond comparison.",Super Mario Bros.

The plot didn't seem to click, the references to the actual games were few, and the characters?  Well, Mario and Luigi were well-done, but the Koopas just weren't.

It is a piece of art in that it's just so damned. fun. I don't think that I've seen a movie which is more fun than this one. I do realise that it has extremely little to do with the actual Mario Bros. games- but the basic groundwork is the same, and it's still a rollocking good time. The first review posted of this movie really should be abolished- it doesn't give the movie any credit at all. It's all good fun, with a surprisingly all star cast. I think the actors felt that it wouldn't further their careers, but they would have been having a good time doing it.What made everyone hate this movie so much? Even my mother liked it! It's just stupid fun. What's wrong with a little stupid fun?The only flaw that I found with it is the ending, because it reeks of a sequel, but we all know there won't be one. (I doubt that the actors would want to do it again).So, although an inaccurate portrayal of the Mario Universe, we still have a pretty good movie on our hands here.",Super Mario Bros.
172,tlwilliams,Do not let the bad rating fool you.,7,25 March 2008,"Mario Bros was the first video game movie ever made and in my eyes, the very best.Bad acting, terrible dialog and some outdated special effects aside this movie created a memorable atmosphere and managed to squeeze out a story from the very thin source material.Sure the story is pretty terrible, I still cringe when I hear the opening ""A meteor fell down and created another dimension"" sequence. But still, they managed to involve so many elements from the games in many different creative ways, so I think it's alright as long as you don't take it too seriously.Again what I really admire from this movie is the atmosphere, it feels somewhat reminiscent of a Terry Gilliam film. All the video game movies made these days are soulless and take themselves too seriously. This one at least has a heart.",Super Mario Bros.
173,Twinrehz,Don't believe the hate,7,15 June 2021,"Okay, so it's not really Mario. Rename the characters, and you have a half-decent cyberpunk-ish movie with a mediocre plot, some quite good set-pieces and effects. Seriously, the special effects in this movie are actually really good, especially by 1993 standards.So why the hate? Probably because people wanted to see a sidescrolling plumber who disappears through giant green pipes and jumps on the heads of mean creatures, and were let down when what they got was a slightly grim cyberpunk sci-fi with some big names and some incredibly dry humour (which is something I absolutely love). The plot itself is fairly thin, but it's still better than a lot of ""damsel in distress""-stories out there; where the movie shines the most are the ways in which the two main characters navigate their way through a brutal and uncaring alien world.I can definitely recommend this movie, and I recommend you don't buy into the hate, put aside your expectations of Mario, don't expect a stellar plot, appreciate the little nods to the franchise, and have a good time with this little action romp!",Super Mario Bros.
174,brucemcoxford,Life in pure cinematic form!,9,4 October 2021,"How can I even explain this with raw, precise and genuine words. I have studied many years in the arts of screenplay and I am soon to get an PhD. After seeing this movie yesterday i just feel completely blown away in all aspects!First off what an incredible casting, just seeing Bob Hoskins on the silver screen playing Mario was like a PTSD straight out of seventh heaven (in a good way) from my days as a child playing Super Mario on my NES. Just wow but I would rather really love to see Clooney or maybe Sean Connery as Mario to be honest. Also a very great choice to have a clean shaven Luigi, just like in the games!Secondly I think this movie really show the power of feminism and equality! Very good scenes with strong independent women and less of the old school sexist and misogynistic scenes that were on every movie back in the day. This movie really is one of a kind in that aspect and made an example of how movies should be for all of us, no matter what gender you are!Thirdly I think the screenplay is almost one of the most unique and realistic pieces of art out there in this business. You really just feel like you are one of the Mario bros when you just watch and hear their conversations, sometimes it just felt so real that I almost got tears of joy when seeing how accurate their brother relation is. I once had a brother and he were excactly like Luigi and behaved like him. Just seeing their daily life reminded me of me and my brother!Well to be fair this movie as really great pieces in all aspects such as cinematography,sound,acting, screenplay etc. But what makes this movie fall so short in the end is the usage of CGI. Oh my god how terrible the CGI is for the whole industry. Pure movies should not have any CGI and just show pure craftmanship. Well i can give it to them that their CGI was much better and artistic than many other movies from the same decade as The Matrix, Forrest Gump, The phantom Menace etc...Overall a really wonderful constructed movie with many life lessons and meanings. In all my years at Oxford and many other univeristies around the world i have studied all the aspects of filmmaking and it makes me so emotional and joyful when i watch this masterpiece. Sometimes I wonder if this is what William Shakespeare thought of when he would describe an ideal play to his friends.

When i was young i liked nearly everything i watched which had anything about it - this did not! Back then i thought it was bad, but i decided to watch it again, and i wish i hadn't Its one of the worst movies i have sat through. Video games when turned into movies don't have a great track record, but this makes the second Mortal Kombat instalment look very good.Mario in the video gaming industry is something of a legend, but this will always be attached to his name, and why Nintendo let this go on shelves is beyond me. Mario as a character is not amazing but it's the superb game play that makes him so loved so why make this awful film It's happened to many franchises in video games, especially that awful Anderson wanting to wreck every video game possible At least when Sonic The Hedgehog got a movie it was animated and was kept low key. Sonic The Hedgehog movie may have had awful voice acting but somehow is still easier on the ears and eyes.

178,SupaSmashBrotha,Better than some would have you believe,6,2 January 2005,"OK, it's no secret these days that the movie has nothing to do with the games, but still, the movie is quite entertaining. The cast did a respectable job with the absolutely lunacy of the scrpit they were given, and Bob and John have good chemistry as the Mario Brothers (I've never understood why the fact their last names were Mario was such a revelation. For Crying out loud, they are the MARIO BROTHERS) The plot is a nonsensical mess, as mentioned earlier, but the movie is more about the what than the why. It's charm lies in it's dumb humor and decent action scenes, as opposed to being mentally engaging. Plus it's surprisingly dark for a Mario movie. And I'm not sure if that's a bad thing or a good thing.There is one exception to something I said earlier. Most of the cast is great for what it is, but Dennis what's his name as King Koopa is just terrible. Still, he doesn't really ruin the movie. It's not good per-se, but it is an enjoyable popcorn flick if you can catch it on TV or for a rental. I give it a 6/10",Super Mario Bros.

Daisy is a cool paleontologist who doesn't take crap from nobody, be they mob-bosses or interdimensional tyrants. face.Even though the cast had a miserable time behind the scenes, it doesn't show at all. The chemistry between the Mario brothers is especially good.It's a simple, fun film that doesn't waste time and would never be made today.",Super Mario Bros.

All the Mario fans (and sonic or whatever) who would like a movie like this would love it. I don't get why some grown up people have to criticise this movie, its not really one for the older generation anyway and if they make a remake it'll be twice as better thanks to the technology we have now. I gave it a ten then and I'm giving it a ten now. Oh and the plot is a little bit loose but what you expect, I mean you don't want to see two plumbers jumping around on bricks do you or what's the point of making the movie?",Super Mario Bros.

Skip to later in time, a princess named daisy is smuggled from the dinosaur world to the human world together with a small meteorite peice that was chipped of on impact, the evil king koopa wants to get his hands on this rock so he can combine the two worlds and take them both over. Now to our main protagonists, mario and Luigi. They're Brooklyn Plumbers who later meets daisy. But then Daisy gets kidnapped by two of koopas henchman, Iggy and Spike. Mario and Luigi follow chase after them resulting in them ending up in the dinosaur world. Now, it's up to the super Mario brother's to rescue princess Daisy and defeat the evil king koopa.
Let's talk about why I love this film. I likeThe casting with Bob Hoskins as Mario and John Leguizamo as Luigi. There's just something about it and I dont know why, but I love these two! Dennis hopper is perfect as the evil egg sucking son of a snake Koopa. He plays the role so incredibly over the top, i just cant help but to laugh!The set design is also incredible. It is set in a dystopian futuristic style city called dinohattan. It's dark and I love it.The music composed by Alan Silvestri is also really good, instead of composing a cinematic version of the Famous Mario theme, he composed something completely different and it fits with the style of the movie.It's not a good adaptation. but if you can separate yourself from it being a Mario movie, you can get some entertainment from it.",Super Mario Bros.
184,fourmont4,Great movie... people should stop being so serious and enjoy it,9,10 December 2005,"First off.... I absolutely love this movie. It's such a treat to a fan with a good imagination.Secondly, why would anyone in their right mind take this kind of movie seriously, to the point of bashing it for things like ""being to fake"" and ""not sticking to the Mario bro's storyline."" People, in the games all Mario did was jump around, bop things on the head, throw fireballs around, and fly. If they would have made movies about that people would be asleep before the first 5 minutes. This movie was meant to entertain and captivate, and it certainly does the trick.They took the classic game and adapted it to a fantasy reality that parallels our own and for that, it was simply brilliant. The rendition of koopa-manhattan was great and is not something that people should criticize. The city adds life the the movie, it makes it real in it's own fantastic way. It makes the city so crazy it works. And boy oh boy did those goomba's make me laugh.I love this movie for everything it relates to the game and everything it added to make it a more fun-filled ride. If you love the games and have an open minded imagination, this is a must watch movie",Super Mario Bros.

Now lets talk abut luiga he ones stole from bowsers female companion and he stole one frame wich means THE FIL GOT PUT DOWN TO 3 FRAMES and that was a twist i enjoyed i luv dis movi and another good part is where mario and luigi stand like a M it stands for mother to show their love to scorpion from mortal combate.,Super Mario Bros.
189,Jaylyons2,Review of Super Mario Brothers!,8,22 March 2008,"This movie has been bashed by several critics. In my opinion, it was one of the best video game adaptations of its time. I remember seeing it in theaters, and I just watched it again with the same enjoyment. There are not many movies today that have the story and excitement that this movie contains.It may have not had the best acting in the world, of the best graphics. But people overlook that it was done very well for a time that did not yet have the computer graphics that we have today. Personally, I do like the acting! It is a great movie for kids and adults alike, who have enjoyed the Game Franchise!",Super Mario Bros.
190,noveltyhat,absolutely amazing,10,19 May 2006,"the staging, the brilliant real-world adaptation of classic Mario lore, and an eastern flavor in its philosophy, this movie is a childhood gem which glows brightly in my mind more than a decade since my last complete viewing. every detail is precise and perfect. every gesture is elegant and praise-worthy. every word a poem in its own right. the style is so amazing it makes you dislike the real world at worst and wish never to return in its most triumphant moments. as a small child, I was lucky enough to receive the audio cassette companion to the film, which is equally insightful and riveting, though visually lacking. such is the imagination of the filmmakers, who bested the mind of even a young child, whose only defense against crushing reality was his puny imagination. their imagination beat mine, ending the legend of children having better imaginations than anyone. moving on, Dennis hopper's beyond-genius portrayal of koopa rivals such classic movie villain performances as Orson Welles' Citizen Kane and Phillip Seymour Hoffman's Capote. john leguazamo is incomparable as Luigi, Mario's dimwitted, yet highly successful companion and brother. the actor who portrays Mario does so with such excellence that I have never seen him in another movie, or at the very least, don't recognize him, nor do I even remember his name! the greatest thing about this movie is its special effects, which clarify and inform much of the on-screen action with such wit and eloquence, that my mind becomes filled with adjectives to describe them. some adjectives include: very good! and tenacious! words, however, have not been invented or combined well enough to describe the climax of this adventure in film magic. this review will be updated when such words become available, but please, dear reader, do not hold your breath. for you would suffer a fate so tragic that Shakespeare himself would be reminded of the various scenes he wrote where characters die from suffocating or holding their breath. in short, this movie is worth buying even if you hate movies or don't own a video player, if only for the box, which features a logo drawn with boundless attention to the film's titular characters, and a plot summary for the ages, which describes the key themes and plot points of the film with a brevity that would send Donovan Bailey, the former fastest man in the world, into a second retirement (were he to read it). all i can say has been said, but do not fear. the movie shall say the rest. listen, won't you?",Super Mario Bros.
191,falconarc,enjoyable,6,1 October 2008,"I have read some of the comments posted here by fellow 'gamers', and I must say people are taking this whole thing a little seriously! In a nutshell, this movie is NOT ever going to win any awards or even come close in any category, but it will put a smile on any kids face, and who knows, maybe I'm just a big kid myself, but after recently watching it again it brought back a lot of fond memories! Comparing it to a Mario game is just stupid, because I think at the time this was made the newest console was probably a SNES?! Mario wasn't even 3D then, and certainly didn't have a constant storyline! It was just plain and simple; SAVE THE PRINCESS! And it is no different here. The movie is cheesy, it's stupid, but most importantly of all I guess, its fun!",Super Mario Bros.
192,ralphies,Boy was this a waste of film...,2,13 December 2002,"I cannot accurately describe how much of a disappointment this movie was to me. I am a huge Mario Bros. fan, but this movie is truly a dark spot in their history. While I did like the Mario Bros. costumes when they eventually got into them, the rest of the movie had little to nothing to do with the games and was very poorly done. The few things that were taken from the games are so twisted that they don't even resemble the character or place which they were based upon. The Mushroom Kingdom isn't a fantastic wonderland of bricks and strange mushroom houses, but a run down New York City filled with ""Dinosaur People"" who look just plain stupid. Toad is some tall hippie guy with bad hair cut, Yoshi is a 2 foot tall T-Rex, and Koopa is Dennis Hopper with too much hair jell. This movie makes the live action segments of Captain Lou Albano on the Super Mario Bros. Super Show look like Oscar winning material.... Well, almost. If you want good Mario Bros. then play the games, and as the tagline for this movie says, ""This ain't no game.""",Super Mario Bros.

The actors were great. And It's basically the same rescue the princess story but in a different setting. Like a more Modern Day Mario. Like I said it's the same Mario Brothers but in a different world. To me Bob embodies Mario perfectly. And So Does John as Luigi. All he needed was the mustache and maybe someone else's voice. It has some really cool action sequences. And I love the flame thrower thing. They could have done a better job on the goombas and koopa though. Look at it as a Mario reference movie. And not the Live Action Mario Movie. And most of all. Keep an open mind and enjoy for what is. And not what everyone thought it was suppose to be.

Has become one of the, if not only, most hated video game movie ever, it's not because of the acting, it's not because of the plot, it's not because of anything this movie tries to do it right, it's just because of how it doesn't look like the games, or they are just dumb, or lazy, because this film does have a complicated plot.And when i say look, i don't really mind it, if i did, i would hate my guts off the Lord of the Rings trilogy for not being anything like the books, at all.If there is flaws on the movie, i can accept it, it's because of this that Snow White can be considered one of the best animated films,right? But it's nothing too heavy that completely destroys the plot for that matter.Plus, this is the reduced cut, pray for Disney to release an 2 hour extended cut, i believe that putting back a lot of missing scenes will improve the film.This movie has fans, i'm one of them, and id you still don't like the film, check the Super Mario Bros. Movie archive, they have all kinds of good stuff that shows that they were going for something awesome, unfortunately, Hollywood Pictures is owned by Disney....",Super Mario Bros.

I think you have to be a special kind of person though...the kind of person that likes movies where people start break dancing in subways for no reason (no, that doesn't happen in this movie.) If you liked Ghostbusters 2 (which I of course LOVED) then your probably the kind of person who would like this movie. The high point is, of course, Leguizamo, who is AMAZINGLY wonderful as Luigi. If I were the princess, I would be happy, Luigi is the sweetest romantic interest in a movie since Jack Dawson in Titanic...Take the movie for what it is--a sweet, err...creative...remake of the game, that doesn't necessarily follow a plot very closely but is still awesome. I'm sorry, but any movie that has devolving creatures and video game heroes from the early 90s is fine by me. Luigi: ""i wanna be witchu!""",Super Mario Bros.

Get that through your heads! 4. I saw a few characters in the movie (I'm not naming names) and I thought, ""Who the hell are these guys?"" I'm telling you this.

Many films try to replicate this atmosphere and failed, This movies succeeds however and provides the audience with a believable performance from both Bob Hoskins and John Leguizamo.The movie is really all about how having good relations can overcome any problem. Take Mario and Big Bertha's relationship which lands the plumbers a pair of boots that give them the ability to jump great heights.Where the film falters is when it comes to daisy who is severely under developed and could have been used in a more interesting way.

Luigi replies with ""Daisy"" she then goes on to say ""you gotta come with me I need your help"". Daisy says all this whilst wielding a gun.

In the movie, the main villain is Koopa, tyrant of a small city in the center of a world-wide desert who wishes to take over the world of man. In the games, a big bertha is a fish.

Would you really enjoy the movie if it were just two plumbers traversing platform after platform? If you were playing it: Yes. If you were merely WATCHING it? Who WANTs to watch a video game that is essentially played for them? No-one.So people may judge the movie based on it's lack of reference to it's origins. Mario Bros. Would make a stupid movie. Konami's Snatcher or Metal Gear Solid would make fantastic movies. But this movie is Super Mario, it has to re-invent itself. And for it's PG rating it does so terrifically well.

Not so good for die-hard gamers,3,27 May 2007,"Just as you would expect from any movie based on a video game, the movie tries to refer to the game with King Koopa (Bowser), Mario, Luigi, and Daisy. The only 2 problems is the movie tries to go too deep into the characters history, and most of the jokes were corny and screamed junior high humor and even made fun of the game it was based on. (Nintendo must have fallen asleep like the rest of us when they saw this movie) The games may have been vague in back story, but it seems mean to include a story of a character that has been seen in one form rather than another. Don't get me wrong, the choices for actors in this film were stellar, but some of the script was lame or doesn't hold true to the actual game. The movie has thankfully already been written off by many who see things in my goggles. This movie is intended for the kids and the gamers who enjoyed playing Super Mario Brothers, and is just a huge spit in the face to gamers who sat down and watched it.Bottom line, the movie was horrible and is thankfully forgotten by gamers and kids alike.",Super Mario Bros.
210,MediumTranslator,"Not the worst flick out there, but certainly questionable.",5,12 September 2009,"The first time I saw this movie, I thought it was great. It was entertaining to say the least. Being that I was eight at the time, and that the movie wasn't in theaters and was in fact on T.V. about 8 years later. When watching, there were and still are a considerable amount of flaws from the video game to the movie. Being that I was and still am a huge Mario fan gives me proper rights to question ""What were they thinking?"" The first thing that bothers me is the intro. It's extremely abrupt, there is nothing interesting about it, and it just jumps down your throat like a teacher that won't give you a second crack at a quiz (if that makes any sense). Next is the setting for where most of the movie takes place, the mushroom kingdom. In the games, they all have a mystical, sort of magical premise that you would like to see in any sort of adventure game. However, in the movie they have no regard for such a thing. The mushroom kingdom to the directors was a disgusting run down city ruled by an evil tyrant named Koopa, which brings me to my next point. Yes the main antagonist is Koopa (whether you want to call him KING Koopa or ""Bowser"" is up to you to a certain point) But considering that in the games he was called ""Bowser"" leaves you with the same question that I asked close to the beginning of this review. Next is the Mario brothers' last names that they lamely mention in the scene where Mario and Luigi get arrested and prosecuted. Mario says that their last names are ""Mario"", and to an extent I can see how that makes for a small laugh, but there's really no excuse for that. If you go to Youtube and look up an inside edition story on Nintendo that dates back to the late 80s, you'll find within that story an interview with an intern at Nintendo of America explaining that the Mario brothers' last names are in fact NOT ""Mario"" he says that ""some things just have no answers"" and in my perspective I think that the directors should have taken a lesson from that. Anyway, the overall premise to the movie in itself is kind of unique, it blends family humor, with action, and gritty world themes. However, that was a turn-off to most critiques and fans alike. I personally didn't have a problem with it, but I have the absolute most respect to people who did. There are so many other problems with this film that stray from the Mario plot, and in the movie itself. Most of you will probably know that Bob Hoskins called it ""a F-ing nightmare"", and if you didn't know this already then you heard it hear. The game's creator and also one of the most important gaming figures on the planet (Shigeru Miyamoto) said himself that he wished the movie was never made. But in a lot of ways I see past that, this movie is almost so bad it's funny, and in a lot of ways holds a good deal of nostalgia for me. So if you're looking for a good quality movie worthy of Oscar material, look somewhere else. However, if you're looking for a flick to laugh AT instead of with, and to embrace the impurity that lies within this movie and that so many Mario fans alike share, then look no further.",Super Mario Bros.
211,madmullet,a pipedream come true,7,5 February 2003,"Face facts, we all had some form of this game in our lives (i am addressing the video game generation 1980-Present), and there isnt one of us that didnt go nuts when they heard that it was finally gonna happen.  Video game movies have now become bad omens, but i think that considering that Mario Bros was one of the first (not to forget the Wizard), it had the most free reign to be different. There were a number of things that i would personally question, had i gotten to critique the film before it was completed (imagine that), like the absense of mushrooms, (aforementioned by another person who has commented on this film), the electric bumper cars, the poorly portrayed Goomba, John Leguizamo, the last name ""Mario"" (which is troublesome in Mario's (Bob Hoskins)case), and the overuse of snot-like substances.

212,Twitchy-Film-Kid,Terrible Movie,1,14 November 2010,"This movie was a terrible movie. It did not take into account any of the actually Mario Bros video game story line and used humans instead of cartoon meaning some of the more mythical character looked nothing like what they were supposed to in the game. The game was also an adults film, it was definitely not suited for the younger audience who actually play the game. This is a shame really because if you haven't Mario you don't know what it is meaning it just seems like a pretty weird and terrible story. I can think of no way to compliment this film. I would definitely advise choosing a different movie if you had this in mind. It is also slightly hard to grasp onto who the characters are and their role in the film, if they were good or bad.",Super Mario Bros.
213,famicommaster43,"It's not as bad as anyone says, it's quite good and entertaining.",9,27 February 2012,"I was 12 when i was first introduced to the Super Mario Bros. movie, i instantly didn't like the film because it wasn't anything like the games, years later, i re-watched the movie with a more open mind, and learning so much about movies and what make them good, i decided to re-watch this movie and guess what? it's a really good movie!It did had character development, everything was explained really well,it didn't had plot holes and the special effects and the creatures looked pretty good!As for the accuracy of the games, it is present in this movie, and it is very subtle, except for the Bob-omb scene, the Koopa Troopas are manly those spiked police men, the Goombas are De-evolved humanoid dinosaurs, and they resemble the original goombas by wearing manly brown, having sharp teeth and being stupid, as for the power-ups, the traditional Mushroom that makes Mario grow, is shown here as an sort of shield, which makes sense, since that when you get the mushroom in the games, you can take an extra hit before dying, so that works as an shield, the fireballs are actually flame-throwers, and my favorite part, the Twomp-Stompers, which are boots that make people jump higher and it's really good, too bad people overlook this and simply bash this film for not being accurate to the games, but no one flipped when the Jackson's Lord of the Rings came and it was almost nothing like the books, right?When it comes to judge films, you have to pay attention to 1:character development, that's what makes people feel for characters, 2: a good story, and yes, dinosaurs that evolved into humanoid creatures is a pretty interesting theme, along with the alternate dimension thing. Some people have recognized the film's merits and it gained a cult following manly at the Super Mario Bros. Movie Archive.Bottom line, it is a really good movie on it's on, watch it with an open mind, and don't be a Nostalgia Critic/8-12 year boy and simply enjoy this film by what it is and not what it should be.Trust The Fungus.",Super Mario Bros.
214,Ichitakasan,Well... it's pretty funny anyway...,7,7 March 2004,"All right! I know what you all think about this film. It's cheap, maybe cheesy, and some of you probably think that it's a shame compared to the wonderful world of Mario & Luigi brought to us through video games.In a sense, that's true, but have you ever thought about the fact that it could be just a humoristic way of using a Super Mario license for 2 hours??? I really think that the first purpose of this movie was to raise the humoristic personality of these 2 Italian brothers. Thus, as a great fan of Mario & Luigi, I took a good time watching this funny possible description of a parallel world, but I may be more open-minded than some people...^_^ Who knows?",Super Mario Bros.

This is one of those films that the die hard movie critics that are not into the whole lame, spoof style movies would hate. While other people may think that it is terrible, it is in direct reflection to the original NES game. there is nothing special and the effects are a little lame, but that is the whole point of it. I highly suggest at least renting this movie from your local Blockbuster of Family Video and giving it a try.

Like the rest of us die hard fans that actually gave it the credit it deserves I love this movie! Although it is not as good as super Mario Brothers 3 the game, it did The best it could for a live action cartoon. I loved it as a child, and I still love it. Still to this day I wouldn't change a thing about it. The cast was absolutely perfect. John Leguizamo played a perfect Luigi. Bob Hoskins played a perfect Mario. And don't get me started on Dennis Hopper as King Koopa! I honestly think the people given this movie a bad rap are just lying because they're scared that their friends would make fun of them. Watch it again you'll love it!!!",Super Mario Bros.

I remember countless days where i would be sick from school and watch this over and over again. You people need to learn to enjoy it and respect it, yes looking back on it now it does have it corny moments but it also was a CLASSIC to me that i couldn't imagine not seeing. It would be like me saying i never watched any the ninja turtle movies! It fits perfectly in that genre!! This always brings back the memories when the original Nintendo was popular! I know some of you remember the original Super Mario Brothers because i played it countless hours. This movie will always be dear to my heart. I recommend anyone that has kids as a must see film. I guarantee they will love it.1990's at its best!!!",Super Mario Bros.
218,Dea_Olivae,Getting off the bandwagon,8,5 July 2009,"I am very picky when it comes to movies and have no problem tearing them apart with ease when they truly do suck, this movie however, does not. As a big fan of the Mario Bros. since the early '90's and a player of the classic games that came before my time, Would I consider myself a hardcore fan of the series? Why yes actually. Super Mario Bros. is not based directly from the games, but rather lives in the so called atmosphere of it. Also one must remember that it would not be wise to make a movie with a silent plumber hitting his head off bricks and jumping down green tubes and that sometimes artistic license is very necessary.The Mario Bros. are still their respective trades but live in Manhattan and are taken into the Mushroom Kingdom. Princess Peach is replaced by a true Brooklyn Woman named Danniella and Princess Daisy takes the Lead as the main female role. Also, Mushroom Kingdom is in fact another dimension. Some fans where very angry at the lack of Princess Peach who was replaced by the Original Princess Daisy and focused more on Luigi and his love interests or that Koopa is played by Denis Hopper But think back: in the early 90's, it was a very expensive option to put in computer generated effects, especially once needed for someone like Bowser!The acting is not bad, although it is easy to tell that John Leguizamo was still a bit of greenhorn when it came to acting. Bob Hopkins is how I believe Mario would behave had he been a New Yorker, although he is a bit rough around the edges at first. He plays more of a father figure to Luigi than in the games as Luigi seems to be in his very early 20's here (20-23) Samantha Mathis was a delight as well as the famous Toad. While Dennis Hopper would not be my first choice as Bowser, he did an excellent job in a certain way and can crack a few smiles.It is a movie that you should give a chance and should not be passed down simply because people like to flame this movie because it was not ""True to the game"".8/10!",Super Mario Bros.
219,interferedlasttime,"Vastly Underrated, never had it's chance to shine, probably never will.",10,1 December 2013,"First off, this film is not deserving of my 10/10. It's not a perfect movie, but the 10 helps. because that's what this film needs after 20 years of a bad reputation, despite there being worst movies out there.But on with the review, and why you should pay attention to it: Do you have any understanding of how films work?How they are planned and made? all the sweat that goes to get something unique and worth watching out there? Well, most people don't, because that's behind the scenes stuff, and that is where people don't often go.I always loved movies and their own history, like, did you know The Dark Crystal had originally less English dialog than it currently had? Did you know that The Thief and the Cobbler was in production for 24 years before it was cut down and made into an Alladin knock-off?Did you know that The Black Cauldron had an R rating,but was immediately cut short for a PG rating?That may surprise some people, but not others, which is where all the ruckus comes from.The film itself is alright,but it has a few problems, the jokes are terrible,it has a childish tone,but there aren't any plot holes or inconsistencies, or at least none that I know of, The acting is good, the characters are likable, the special effects still hold up, and it actually feels like an actual movie, instead of a knock-off with game references thrown around.The source of the problem comes with the fact that it isn't like the games, and some people can get through it easily, but others don't, and for those who don't, they often made reviews saying it's a bad movie even though it doesn't really has any true merits of a bad movie, so in the end, people don't look past the fact the film isn't the game, and drag everything down with it because ''My childhood was ruined, I don't understand filmmaking''Often people would wonder how ''good'' this film would be if it was like the games, I put ''good'' between commas because here's a shocker: you can't make a good Mario movie out of it's source material.The reason why you can't make a Mario movie out of it's source material is because it goes well with the games, which is where they were born, and translating it to Live-Action simply wouldn't work, I know this because I have read one of the original versions of the script, and it was accurate to the games, Koopa was a lizard, Luigi had a mustache, The Mushroom Kingdom was a huge greenfield, Piranha Plants, Koopa Troopas, you name it. Only problem, It didn't felt like a movie, it felt like a Wizard of Oz knock-off with Mario thrown in. It wasn't just me though, lots of directors at the time dismissed this version of the screenplay because it was so bland and forgettable.Some things only work in a video game, and some things only work in live action, Could you do a Citizen Kane video-game?No. Can you make a Lord of the Rings movie that fully respects it's source material? No. You might be thinking I am a hypocrite for mentioning the LOTR Trilogy because it's not like the books, and tell you to like the Super Mario Brothers Movie for the exact opposite reason, my answer is: Lord of the Rings was a 800-page book, everything was established, and fleshed out; SMB. had no story, no character, no depth, it was just one big mess, and you can't make a movie out of that, so it was only logical to make changes.The ideas directors Rocky Morton and Annabel Jankel had for Super Mario Brothers were what shaped the project into what it is,But Disney is the one I blame for ruining the film.The film was originally going to have this awfully dark tone, Koopa's role as a dictator was expanded, and the world of Dinohattan fleshed out in a more mature way, and more. When Disney bought the film, the script was severely dumbed down for the PG rating, and even when they finished the film, it's original 2 Hours and 10 minute version received a PG-13 rating.30 minutes of footage is a lot, several things were cut from the movie, Sub-plots fleshing out the Mario Brothers were cut, Entire action sequences were either cut short, or cut out completely, like Mario being chased by Goombas on Koopa's Tower, and even alternate scenes where Daisy meets the Mario Brothers ,or Lena herself giving Koopa the rock on the Mud Tub, it would be a treat to see those deleted scenes back into the movie.But like many Disney films, like The Black Cauldron and Song of the South, we may never see the extended version of this film, or even a Blu-Ray release, for that matter, all we have now is an easy-to-find DVD release, sourced from the Laserdisc release of the film, suffering from several problems that makes the movie almost unwatchable.You can still dislike the movie if you want, but you must dislike it for what it is, and not for what it should be, it's intentions flew way beyond that, face the facts, and acknowledge them, you don't even need to explain why you dislike the film, just tell you don't like it, because disliking not only this film, but anything in general because it went far from your expectations, even though they were not your target, is simply not cool. It makes you look like a douche-bag.In the end, Super Mario Brothers. Give it a watch if you want, watch it for what it is, and don't expect a colorful fat plumber jumping on mushrooms and hitting blocks, because then you'd be better off with a controller in your hand playing the game.",Super Mario Bros.
220,danielvaldez-59229,"Wow, that was actually kinda, good.",6,5 April 2019,"The super mario bros movie takes on a somewhat bladerunner noir-esque tone with with actors with decent performances, though I can imagine that the directors didn't give alot of, direction, despite the intresting little details like the cityscape having references to the game, and how there are bumper cars in the place of normal vehicles, or how the de-volver king koopa uses in the film resembles a snes zapper.. The 90s slang is painful in dialogue, however, and the acting direction is painful when it feels like these actors could've done much better. That said, I don't think this film should be watched as an adaptation to the original source material, I think by breaking away so much from it, it's able to accomplish a product so unique that it is it's own thing. I'd hope of this film to get remade for less contemporary audiences to focus more on the neo-noir and world building aspects.",Super Mario Bros.
221,poopenmeyer,Truly Avant Garde,8,17 April 2009,"Many talk about how Casino Royale was a gritty reinvention/reinterpretation of the James Bond series, well despite the naysayers and haters alike, Super Mario Bros. was and is a great gritty reinterpretation of the Mario Brothers franchise.The Mario brothers came from being plumbers from some dream land who jump on angry brown mushroom men and turtles to manhattenite plumbers who free a dystopia from an evil dictator who rules the streets with a race of dino-nazi's. Bad-Ass.Super Mario Bros. is by no means a bad adaptation, the DOOM film was a bad adaptation, Legend of Chun li is a bad adaptation, films that could've been relabeled anything, a waste of their respective licenses. Super Mario Bros. was the Casino Royale of its time. It's still Mario Bros., two brothers try and save a princess who's been kidnapped by King Koopa, battling his army of Goombas and koopa troopas in a land filled with mushrooms that come out of bricks. Compare that to DOOM. Furthermore, Super Mario Bros. is insanely watchable, unlike Alone In The Dark.Perhaps it's just my nostalgia or my love of John Leguizamo and Samantha Mathis but Super Mario Bros. is a freakin' amazing movie that gives Mario a GUN.",Super Mario Bros.

This one is cult!!!,10,18 October 1998,"If you slaughter this movie and call it 'yet another commercial mistake' etc. you just haven't watched this movie close enough. I've watched it like a hundred times and it's just awesome!! There are so many details such as parodies and irony in this movie.... the society is like a parody of the American society, and you find these details that just blow you away. Take for example the Bob-omb: if you watch very closely when it stops under Koopa, you can see it says under the Bob-ombs feet: ""Reebok"", and there's a little British flag!! Also the ""vote for koopa"" campaign, the old woman with the gun, take anything. It's just wild. It's so weird and stupid and funny the same time it's just.... GREAT!! Another thing is the great actors (minus the Daisy-woman, she's no fun at all) and the well-written script. Everything is connected. Come on guys- this is cult. A weird kinda cult, you don't believe it the first time you see it, but later on-- this is just GREAT FUN!!! This was supposed to be a kids movie - but this is adult fun. Believe me.

Forget the plot, effects etc. Hoskins, Leguizamo and Hopper are tremendous to watch in a movie where they all obviously said ""screw my career I'm doing this"".Most complaints surround the inaccuracy of the storyline and characters with the video game version. Since the Mario Bros. video game plots were very simple a film maker would have to flesh them out in order to have a feature film produced.The ""de evolved"" dinosaur world is very atmospheric and the overall visual tone of the film is great.Certainly not a ""classic"" or award worthy but rent it, watch it and tell me you don't enjoy it.",Super Mario Bros.

Ot is there some place for soundtrack or any other possibility? I saw it like a hundred years ago and when you are a young toddler, this film, at least for me, was pretty cool stuff. I thought wow, I've played the game and now I see a movie with Mario and Luigi. I thought it was a cool movie, may not to bee seen for 15 times but I saw it one time for like 7-10 years ago.

Everything about it is amazing, no saying amazing is an understatement. This movie deserves a word us trash humans can't comprehend. Goomba is the reason I'm here today. I left the theater a new man.

230,daydreambeliever616,Worth seeing if you haven't yet.,8,4 September 2006,"Although a lot of Nintendo fans might disagree, I think Super Mario Bro.s was a good movie. It might have steered away from the video game a bit, but how realistic would a big turtle-like Koopa who shoots fireballs have been? If anyone other than Dennis Hopper had the role of King Koopa, the character would have failed completely, and the movie along with it.As for the role of Luigi, John Lequizamo was an excellent choice. This role was a piece of cake for him, compared to his roles as a maggot-eating clown from hell in ""Spawn"" and a drag queen in ""To Wong Foo Thanks for Everything, Julie Newmar"". He is also one of my favorite actors, which improves my overall outlook on this movie.Overall, this movie might not have the cute bright green Yoshi everyone loves, but it's still very entertaining, given you're not a Super Mario video game fanatic. If you haven't seen it, I recommend it to anyone who wont care if it's not exactly like the game.",Super Mario Bros.
231,chaseslaughter,I Am Not Joking,7,21 July 2020,"Let's go back to 2009. I had just turned 10 and had just recently invested in the Mario franchise. I was so obsessed that I just couldn't get enough. I had all the games, toys, DVD's of the cartoon, and so-on. I discovered the Mario Bros. Movie while I was looking at live action recreations of the brothers. At first, the image I saw I thought was fake. It wasn't until I looked it up on IMDb only to find it was real. Upon discovering, I was destined to find a copy. At the time, there was still a Blockbuster in my hometown. I've been a handful of times, renting the cartoon. I guess every time I went, I glared over it. I vaguely remember seeing the art out of the corner of my eye, but it never caught my attention. When I found it available for rent, I took it home, watched it and I'm not joking when I say this. I loved it. It's not exactly like the game, but it's elements are there. For me, I felt like I was watching the Mario Bros and I still do today. For a lot of people who were alive when this movie came out, they shun this movie. But some praise it. And then when later generations discover it, they're bewildered. Now about the movie itself, the story is the basic plot. Princess gets kidnapped, Mario and Luigi go and save her. But have you wondered why Bowser always kidnapped her? Me too. In this, while it's not Princess Peach (Toadstool), but Princess Daisy instead, Daisy has a key that Koopa needs to merge dimensions with his world and the real world. I'm glad that the filmmakers gave Koopa a reason to kidnap the princess versus just taking her with no explanation. And for its effects, this movie has some very amazing practical effects. You just have to watch it to believe it. And while Bob Hoskins regrets making the movie, he really does a good job as Mario. Same with Leguizamo, Hopper, Mathis, and the rest of the cast and crew. I understand this movie isn't for everyone and left the cast and crew scarred, but personally I loved it because of the mere discovery of it and its still really good.",Super Mario Bros.

The main characters don't even RESEMBLE the original video game stars, so this shouldn't even have the word Mario associated with it. It should just be called Super Brothers. Or maybe just Brothers, since the production has absolutely nothing 'Super' about it. Also with the aforementioned lack of resemblance of the real characters, it's debatable if the film versions of Mario and Luigi are at all related.

241,kinder_ben,a teenagers perspective,8,16 March 2007,"This film, contrary to the opinion expressed before, entertained me just as much now as it did when i watched it as a child. Bob Hoskins plays Mario very well and definitely does the franchise justice. I think that showing the Mario Brothers in a darker environment helps to add depth to the characters and to the story because it puts them somewhere new, also this kept me interested because it was different to the usual 'Mario' environment of sun and smiles. If you were a child when this came out then it is definitely worth buying on DVD and reminiscing. Be warned though, this is just my opinion; the film isn't enough like the video game franchise for some people.Long story short, give it a go. It's in bargain bins these days........what's the worst that could happen?",Super Mario Bros.
242,ahoffins,Enjoyable,6,2 April 2007,"As noted by a previous reviewer, they said that the Mushroom kingdom in the movie was far too dark, as portrayed by the games to be a light-hearted welcoming place. However.. I may bring up the fact that it IS a light-hearted welcoming place.. HOWEVER bowser, or another villain had come to the Mushroom Kingdom and made it a very BAD place, until Mario and Luigi save the day.. Which basically follows the plot of the movie. We don't want to watch movies with no conflict, if the Mushroom Kingdom had been this perfect place, what were Mario and Luigi to do? I think this movie portrayed the Mushroom Kingdom accurately, but only focused on the times when the Kingdom was in peril..Overall I have to say I enjoy the movie, its now 2007 and can still enjoy watching it. Although at some points I have to laugh, it seems like a B-Rated film at times.. but completely enjoyable. I will continue to watch this, until my VCR breaks and can't find a new VCR.",Super Mario Bros.

245,cg_jack_j,Great movie,10,27 June 2007,"this is one of my favorite movie... i see that the ranking is low, 3.5 come on... is not a bad movie... is a fantastic movie.. is just different from the video game, but how can you put a game like super Mario in a movie?! will not work... and this story, work a lot... super Mario is cool, Luigi too, the idea of another dimension where reptiles evolve themselves is really original. the story is great, just a cool movie, i put 10 cause i love this movie, but to be realistic a 7 or 8 can be OK. but not 3.5... is not a realistic vote. i've seen this movie first time when i was very young on VHS, then the first version on DVD (unfortunately direct copy from the VHS master...) and then finally a cool version DVD really master. great songs in this movie, from queen, from Charles and eddy, and the super rock song ""speed of light"" from Satriani",Super Mario Bros.
246,sokolmp,Doesn't make much sense...,10,2 May 2008,"This certainly wasn't a very well-made movie, and I really wonder what the script writers were thinking. But negatives aside, there were some easter eggs in this film. There were more similarities between the movie and the games than most viewers might notice: -Dennis Hopper's hair style: It is the same ruffled hair as Koopa has in the games, except that it's not bright red.-Jumping into the wall: Mario and Luigi jump through a solid wall in the cave, just like Mario does with the paintings and rock walls in Super Mario 64. But this movie was made BEFORE Super Mario 64... ? -The ""Devo Chamber"" is basically like the throne rooms of the kings in Super Mario Bros. 3, with the white tiled walls and the golden chair.-The large suspended steel vat that Koopa is thrown into near the end is a little like the clown-faced hover machine that he rode in Super Mario World, minus the clown face.-The ""Koopa Hotline"" communication device in Koopa's tower made a 1-UP noise when it was activated.-In the games, princess toadstool has a jewel on the front of her dress. In this movie, she wears the glittering meteorite around her neck.-The ""Koopahari Desert"" name for the desert area of the world remains the same between the game and movie.-The scissor lifts used in the police station scene are ever so slightly similar to the spring boards in Super Mario World.-I'm guessing that the cave area with the meteor is ""vanilla dome""?",Super Mario Bros.
247,gjwilliams1,I used to think you couldn't ruin something that lacked any depth,2,28 November 2007,"..but I was wrong.Quite frankly the choice of the brothers Mario as the protagonists for anything outside of an animated movie is non sensical to begin with. The directors made some bizarre attempt to bring a colorful surreal world into an unappetising hybrid of Blade Runner and Ernest. The dialogue is mostly dull, the plot predictably ridiculous but either not ridiculous enough or far too absurd, you be the judge. I felt embarrassed for Dennis Hopper all the way through, he deserves better, but his role as the noticeably non lizard Koopa is one of the most unfortunate he could possibly have pulled.The only saving grace of this movie is Bob Hoskins manages to somehow pull out a decent performance despite appalling dialogue and shoddy direction. Kids who don't know an awful lot about the original game may be mildly entertained, fans and objecters alike will most likely be united in their distaste for this movie.",Super Mario Bros.
248,jahcriado-1,"No, really, this movie is horrible",1,30 August 2008,"There are some reviewers who are saying that, ""Gosh, its based off a video game of a guy stomping on turtles & saving a princess. They had to change it for the movie: & it worked great!"" Eh, yeah. Now, I understand the need to change or modify parts of the basic story to fit into movies. They do it with comics a lot & other stories that are not deep or are to short to fill in that gap. But heres the problem: even taking into account that they had to modify the story & look of the characters - this movie is horrid! Remove the fact that the Mario game franchise even existed & this movie is a stinker. Heres my question? why even do a live action movie based on SMB? This came on the heels of an era when Carebears & Transformers had pretty freaking good traditional animation movies made. There was a (though it was pretty dumb) cartoon that had Mario in it at the time, why not work off that? Or hey - soon after this movie came out CG really hit the big time with Toy Story. Why not do it up right with some awesome CG Mario Bros. takin' on the Mushroom Kingdom? But seriously people, lets have an intervention. When movies ARE bad, its OK to say they are bad. Repeat after me: This movie is horrendous, this movie make Uwe Boll look like Spielberg.",Super Mario Bros.
249,Bonehed,DVD PLEASE!!!,10,8 August 2002,This movie was great and I dont see why anyone who loves to play any mario brothers game would dislike the movie. You have a point when you say its not like the game but come on now. You wouldnt want to watch the movie if luigi and mario jumped on goomba heads over and over. The movie had a good plot and was similar to the games but yet people still have issues with it but more power to them I guess. I would buy this movie on DVD if it would ever come out but what are my chances in that? 1 in a million? BRING IT OUT ON DVD!!!!!!!!,Super Mario Bros.
250,adsta2,I love this movie,10,30 August 2002,"First of all I absolutely love this movie. Now, people are saying that the movie is nothing like the video game. Lets all think about this for a while. The video game goes along these guidelines. Princess Daisy is captured by Koopa, mario and luigi have to save her. To do this they must go through a world full of mushrooms and kooper troopers. Now what is the plot of the movie? Ahhh, it is exactly the same. I hope they release this on DVD. And even better if they ever release part 2.",Super Mario Bros.
251,mars221,"A brilliant, underrated film",8,30 April 2008,"As the first movie to be adapted from a video game, Super Mario Bros. wasn't without its flaws. The references to the game itself we few and far apart, and the brothers weren't in their signature red and green overalls until the last twenty or so minutes, and there was a lot of untouched potential in those respects.However, what would have happened if the movie was based on the 'story' of the games? I'm not sure I would want to watch a plumber jumping five times his height on the top of turtle-like creatures, kicking their shells into small brown triangle shaped monsters for eighty minutes before fighting the evil Bowser, and I doubt any of you would either.Instead, we were given the story of two Brooklin-based plumbers who are pulled into an adventure set in an alternate dimension which, from what I can tell, follows the basis of the Mario Brother's story. True, the world they are taken to isn't called the Mushroom Kingdom, and we don't find any mention of Princess Toadstool which is a bit of a let down.Instead of making a complete children's movie based on the almost happy and colourful land of the Mushroom Kingdom, the movie was set in a world created after the meteor that killed the dinosaurs. In an attempt to appeal to an older audience, darker themes are used in the film than in the games, such as King Koopa's plan to take over our dimension for our resources, the fact most of Koopa's world lives in a state of near-poverty thanks to our universe acquiring most of the planet's resources, and various ways in which the world's inhabitants act.For the first movie based on a video game, it was a great attempt, and does not deserve the awful comments and reviews it has received. I'm probably one of the few Nintendo fans to actually enjoy this film, and am very glad to have had the experience of its retro thrill.To expect the movie to be one and the same as the games would be silly... Would you really want to sit through a movie you've already played through yourself?",Super Mario Bros.
252,greenschoolhatehomework,Not your Japanese Super Mario Bros. Kids you've been warned!!,4,17 April 2009,"Alright, I'm just gonna say it now, this movie sucked! First of all, what happened to the mushroom kingdom?! That's a big part of Mario!!! Another problem is if this was really based on Super Mario Bros, why is there Daisy instead of Peach, where's Princess Peach? Some of the music and stunts were cool, I wonder if Miyamoto has seen this disaster, he probably cried, There's swearing and sexual content like strippers and prostitutes, if you want kids Mario, play Super Mario Galaxy!!! or i hate to say it, go see Hannah Montana the Movie anyways, Epic Fail! but i hate Nintendo of America for giving the rights to some unknown studio, i love Nintendo of japan, this was soooo not the Mario I know and love. I am disappointed in NoA and Hollywood studios, oh and I know if there was to be another movie, that Miyamoto and Iwata wouldn't let it come to Japan, they have the real mario movies, and animal crossing the movie, just another reason to be jealous of Japan :(",Super Mario Bros.
253,Azurewolf02,A Disgrace to Mario,2,31 August 2008,"I have exactly two words for this movie. IT SUCKS. Don't watch it-you'll regret it. My friend and I were looking through his movie closet for something to watch, and we came up with this movie. I'd never seen it before, so we popped it in. After about 41 minutes of watching it, we turned it off. It was more than I could take in. WHY wasn't this movie ANIMATED? I mean, it was creative to have real dudes play the parts, but they didn't look like what they were supposed to be! It didn't resemble the games. Bowser's a human, Princess Peach is some girl named Daisy--I didn't even get what was going on. The plot is incredibly weak and the jokes aren't funny at all, if you can call them jokes. Pretty much the only part I liked was when Mario and Luigi went to jail--that was kinda funny. But this gives Mario games a bad name. Thanks to this movie, there probably won't be any good Mario movies, or Zelda movies.",Super Mario Bros.

This picture may only be mindless entertainment, but I think that it should have Cult status. Maybe there is something wrong with me but I truly enjoyed this Movie,,I have it in my collection and would recommend it to any one",Super Mario Bros.
255,sanithdemil,Bad in a good way...,5,19 November 2008,"When I first saw it I hated it for not being the great fantasy it could have been. Making the SMB into a SF is like making a pizza into ice cream. But that aside if you watch it as a popcorn movie and try to forget it has anything to do with Mario it's pretty good. As a stand alone SF B movie it's as fun to watch as Plan Nine from Outer Space or other great mistakes like Godzilla(1998).Pros: It has lots of fun slapstick humor and gags the kinda of stuff you'd probably see if you watched the Super Mario Super Show or the Three Stooges. The campyness of the sets and costumes makes them lovable. There's No bathroom Humor something that seems to be the hallmark of all kids movies nowadays. There are lots of fun side characters like the helpless old woman who holds up the Brothers and steals the stone. The Brothers do actually ply their trade and fix a few leaks. Cons: It's nothing like the video games, Most all of the game references are misplaced. There are a lot of throw away lines. The cartoon intro helps to throw all realism out the window from the very start. Cartoon explanations do work but only in films like Jurassic Park where they're part of the park instead of serving as an intro. Most of the plot makes no since at all, like the idea that Koopa and a few thousand Goombas could take over the whole world. Also if the humans in this film come from Dinosaurs why don't their bone structures look anything like them? How can the devolved characters have any logical thought at all? How can Iggy and Spike know anything they didn't already know and if they did already know then why didn't their brains lose the information when they were shrunk. Why aren't Mario and Luigi wearing overalls, did the film costume budget run out. If there's hardly any water then how can the fungus and vegetables grow. How does the King return to normal when Koopa dies? Nobody shot him with a evolution gun. Or for that matter how does he produce magical items if the film's supposed to be SF? The biggest error I saw besides the whole plot was that if the Royal family had the power to come to our world all along why didn't they? The whole rest of their world wants to come here so why not them?",Super Mario Bros.
256,KneeHiTheSamurai,Why did I enjoy this movie so?,10,26 May 2003,"It should be understood going into this movie that any sane person couldn't take this project seriously, and that I think is what makes it so fun. The actors are all too appropriate(I still can't get over Bob Hoskins' real accent), and they add exactly the effortless kind of ambivalent goofiness this movie needed.

I used to watch it as a kid with my Aunt. The plot is amazing and I think it is a great movie for kids to enjoy. I love the Mario games and I think that if you are a Mario brothers fan, this movie should be added to your collection. As a little kid I thought the movie was amazing. More kids would probably like this movie more than adults would. I do not think adults have the ability to ""get into"" this movie, UNLESS they were a Mario bros fan as a child. I think people don't fully understand the plot of the movie, and how it all started out. The way the movie fits with the original Mario Bros story is amazing. About how they're Italian plumbers and they are always saving Princess Daisy. Especially how the pipes fit into the story. I also think the actors chosen to play Luigi and Mario were both AMAZING choices.I am pretty positive this movie will always be one of my all time favorites.",Super Mario Bros.

I myself am a gamer and am personally offended by this movie. The casting was O.K. (But really, John Leguizamo?) The movie mainly consists around Mario, Luigi, fungus, Big dumb things in trench coats and King Koopa played by Denis Hopper. It slowly decreases into a miniature T-Rex and muppets. I think that this movie is only really good for commentaries, so if you do not like suffering, do not watch this movie, UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES.",Super Mario Bros.
259,snuffles1588,Good Movie.,10,5 August 2010,"I love this movie. It can be a little cheesy at times but that's OK by me. Its funny, and fallows the game as closely as a movie can. A lot of items and events, IE sounds or what ever, from the game show up and the story line makes sense, as tho there could be a game that uses it from the Mario bros series. The brothers them self are well played and fit perfectly as you would think they would be. All in all its a good movie, so ignore all the nay-sayers who try comparing it to the video game or what ever, and put it down! Its definitely worth watching if you like comedy and Super Mario. And for those people that say it is a shame to a game that saved Nintendo you really should get your facts in order. After Super Mario was released for Nintendo Classic they were bankrupt. Mario was a good game but the system its self was missing a lot in all its other games and Mario did nothing to help. If you look into the history of Nintendo Final Fantasy, which was going to be there last game, hint the name, There Final Fantasy, saved the system and company not Mario. Its there face now but its just another game which happens to have a pretty good movie based off of it! Bye bye all!",Super Mario Bros.

From now on that is the most selled game ever, even today that record hasn't been broken.I guess people hate this movie because of mentioning about 'evolution' too much. Creationist groups don't like that kind dialogs. Although these Mexican brothers speak funny, especially Mario, some scenes seem so spare. And the parallel universe containing dark streets looks like old school type.But the main reason is that; movie runs in an unexpected way! OK, there is princess, there is a final level monster, there are a lot of mushrooms, but the story we know doesn't exactly exist. As I mentioned above, the parallel universe is out of the concept, so seems weird.Personally, the actors/actress performances are cool, the visual effects aren't bad. Worth to watch I guess.",Super Mario Bros.
263,roareye,"Classic Cult Cyberpunk, Unfairly Judged",8,2 January 2012,"Super Mario Bros the Movie manages several well-known things - firstly it's the first ever mainstream Video Game Movie adaption, and secondly star Bob Hoskins has stated it as the worst film he's ever made.So how can I review this film so highly, despite the main star's objections to the quality of it? The truth of the matter is that this film isn't as terrible as the hype states it is. Being the first Hollywood adaption of a video game series, and being different from it's source material, there wasn't really anything to compare it to. If you were hoping for a genuine conversion of the game's storyline into a movie, then you are going to be highly disappointed - but then you've made a rather rash assumption that the basic story of the game series would work as a film to begin with. Movies need to be like epic events, a major moment of the character's lives cataloged within an hour and a half (minimum). The game's theme of 'Bowser has the Princess, run into castle and have toad say ""Your Princess is in another castle"" 7 or 8 times before the end' doesn't make for a good film.Excuses aside, the film does succeed in the way it intends to. It is extremely fun. Unlike other films with it's reputation, the Super Mario Bros Movie is genuinely enjoyable and even more so thanks to the few downfalls in it's script. Bob Hoskins cracks me up as Mario ""Get Your Belt on Kid! We're going' in!"", and Dennis Hopper is clearly the inspiration for Doctor Evil from Austin Powers ""See you later, Alligator"". The movie manages to do something few films manage - it improves with age. I'm not going to state that it's as superb as Blade Runner (As stated on the box), because they're from two very different worlds. Blade Runner is a classic in terms of being a thought-provoking high-caliber sci-fi drama, Super Mario is a classic in terms of being a cheesy fun-fueled thrill-ride. The only reason these two were compared in the first place was the similarity of a run-down ugly futuristic city, both of which were furnished with surprisingly high quality set design and standards. I would love to see a full Blu-Ray restoration of this movie because there is so much intricate work done on the backgrounds and in the details that the additional quality Blu-Ray affords would allow us even more joy. There are some good jokes in here, the pace is good and never slacks, and while there are some bad script- writing problems the enjoyment should allow most people to gloss over those issues without much problem (Look at Star Trek 2009, horrific script, plot holes and some truly terrible Hollywood writing but because it was so fun and full of action, it is hailed as a great film). This makes it more closely related to being the Star Trek 09 movie of its day, with special effects that were (at the time) really impressive and a mixture of family humor and more adult action (Bob Hoskins sticking his face in a black woman's chest - golden).I would love to see a restored Blu-Ray of this movie, as it is a great fun movie. It is more fun than many more recent video game based movies (The Resident Evil series is stale, the Degeneration movie was miss-able, the Final Fantasy films were badly directed, they even got it wrong with Yakuza: Like A Dragon...), most are bland (Something nobody could say about Super Mario Bros, whether they like it or not) or outright horrific, especially if made by Uwe Boll. Super Mario Bros is not the best movie ever made, but it never intended to be. It wasn't supposed to be a movie epic like Blade Runner or 2001: A Space Odyssey, nor was it supposed to be a direct translation of the game, which in itself would have been far worse and less enjoyable. It was intended to stand on its own two feet as a fun, family-oriented action movie with darker sci-fi undertones and while it never accomplishes them to perfection, it certainly succeeded well enough to continuously provide a fun and entertaining movie experience.Some ideas are quite cool, others are a little childish, but that tends to come with the territory with family-friendly Hollywood movies. Again, now more than ever, Nintendo are family-oriented and their Wii console is centered around allowed the kids in as much as the teens and adults - another sign of this film being more accurate now than it was even at the time of its release.As for possible Blu-Ray extras, I would adore an audio commentary by Bob Hoskins with him just hating on the film. You can imagine that would be a funny commentary. The Raw Deal Blu-Ray has an HD extra of a movie critic slating the movie. He-man DVDs have fan-commentaries ragging on the quality of the episodes while still speaking fondly of the series they adore. If the extras on these don't harm the sales, then the same thing for Super Mario Bros would only raise the sales of this film as people would be keen to hear what he has to say since his outbursts on the movie in the media. Other extras can include original script outlines and differences, several deleted scenes and the possibility of a re-cut.I hope to see a decent Blu-Ray release of this movie soon. They've got Blu-Ray releases of Street Fighter, Mortal Kombat and other video game movies of the era, Super Mario deserves at least the same.",Super Mario Bros.

It takes a popular game and mixes it with someone of a fantasy-reality situation and makes your classic adventure come to life! Think about it! If you were to take those actors with that technology and make every single aspect of the video game become reality in the movie, would anyone watch it? No. If you tweaked it even the slightest bit, you'd ruin the entire storyline. These people did something unique. They made a game become in the real sense, with real people, doing more real things than in the video game. The fantasy part was just to entertain those who cannot do without.

Many of the video aspects are fairly subtle. Every time you see it you're bound to find new things. Below is a partial listing. See if you can find more yourself.1) All the main characters are in it at some point: Mario, Lugi, The Princess, Yoshi, Kupa, Spike, Iggy, Toad, The King, Gumbas. 2) They get to the Mushroom Land though a portal inside a sewer, much like many of the portals in the game 3) I feel free to call it ""Mushroom Land"" because there are indeed mushrooms all over it, and they help the Marios on the quest, much like the ones in the game. 4) Some of the gumbas have fire ball throwing guns, the game has gumbas that shoot fireballs 5) The mushroom land in the movie is surrounded by desert; there are many desert levels in many of the Mario games 6) The ""de-evolution"" guns in the movie are actually the the shoulder rifel things from SNES 7) Yoshi has his power tongue action 8) Babombs!!! 9) After the Marios defeat Kupa Lugi holds up a piece sign as he and Mario float off, also reminiscent of the end of levels in the game 10) The final scene before the credits is the princess coming back to the brothers for help, implying a long cycle of battles, much like the game/ game series (almost 20 years at the war rages on...)PS I say ""final scene before the credits"" because there is actually one at the end of the credits as well. Its only about 10sec long. But you'll have to watch for yourself to see what that is. (I know, Shameless Promo)Viva Mario Bros!",Super Mario Bros.

270,ag463,You all are crazier than Tom Cruise. This mess is fun.,7,26 September 2005,"I'm reading through these reviews and wondering: is everyone losing it, or is it me? This movie is fun, weird, and nicely dark. It's no Citizen Kane but it's better than most ""family"" dreck any day. I don't mind telling you all that I am 21 and I just went and bought it so I could sit around with my friends, get hopped up on goofballs, and trust the fungus once again.Here's my take. It's a preteen's movie, not a kid's movie, so there's a degree of poetic removal to things -- i.e., you have to have the grey matter required to go from ""Toad in game is a mushroom"" to ""Toad in movie is a hippie"" to ""aha! Hippies eat mushrooms, I get it."" Or another: ""Bowser in game is a king in a castle"" --> ""Koopa in movie is a CEO-type in a skyscraper."" I personally do not think this is a bad thing, but these comment boards are full of wackies who are obsessively comparing the movie to the game. People: if someone was going to make a movie about the Mario games that stuck to fact, it'd be nonsensical, there'd be no story, and you might as well slump on the couch and watch a friend play the game for a couple hours. Instead, they interpreted, and the result is sometimes stupid and often kooky and rarely boring.",Super Mario Bros.
271,Fdradnats-918-50816,"Don't trust me, trust the fungus!",10,8 February 2014,"Mario has gone stagnant these days. There hasn't been any real innovation in the games since Mario Galaxy, back in 2007. Mario 3D World? Oooh- now I can be a cat! Please. But back in 1993, when Mario and company were less established, the Super Mario Bros. Movie dared to bring the brothers into a new and exciting world. And created something special in the process. I've heard all the criticisms. It doesn't take place in the Mushroom Kingdom. Neither did Mario 2, Mario Land or Mario World. In fact, Mario World takes place in Dinosaur Land. So the films' Dinohattan isn't too far off. The Princess should be Peach, not Daisy. Except Peach wasn't named that until Mario64 in 1996. Before she was called Toadstool. So Mario Lands Daisy was the better choice. Luigi doesn't have a mustache. No, he doesn't. Boohoo, cry me a river, build a bridge and get over it. The thing is, this is a real fun movie and a good, if dark family film, with out cursing or nudity. And the Goombas, though far different than the ones in the games, are great bits of animatronics. As is Yoshi, a dinosaur with such personality that the makers of Jurassic Park hung around the set to pick up pointers. Too many people have made up their minds about this movie based on the words of internet critics, a dubious occupation if ever there was one, or the sole fact that ""It's not like the games!"" Personally, I think many would be surprised by how enjoyable this movie is. But don't take my word for it, watch it yourself. Trust the Fungus!",Super Mario Bros.
272,xclaude626,Perfect example of why Hollywood film makers should stay out of the gaming world.,1,30 May 2005,"Hello, My name is Duy. A typical teenage kid who grew up playing video games. Needless to say, I am a huge fan of the Mario Bros series created by Nintendo.I am extremely disappointed in this movie.I have given this film a second chance by watching it again after my first impression from 10 years ago. Unfortunately, it did not change my view.I have played ALL of the Mario games ever created by Nintendo; from monochrome 2D to fully 3D rendered games. The representation of the ""Mushroom Kingdone"" in the game is a VERY bright and joyful fairy tale-like universe. The one portrayed in the film is a dark, sinister, and violent, which is pretty much the EXACT opposite of the impression that the game gave me. They couldn't even get the COSTUME right! The MAIN character, Mario, is suppose to have BLUE overall with red shirt underneath, and a red hat that has the famous ""M"" stitched on it. The film has Mario dressed NOT in an overall... AND not the right colors! In the movie, Mario wore a plumber suit (which is forgivable I guess)... but... the colors are reversed... He had RED as the overall portion and BLUE as the sleeves... and... no famous ""M"" anywhere to be found.Is it just me or is this film centered around Luigi rather than our main man, Mario? Oh yea, speaking of character names... the name is pronounced, ""MAR-REE-OH"".... It gets annoying when every character in the film refers to the main man as, ""MEEAR-REE-OH"".Why Daisy? Just WHY Daisy? She's barely a known character. Where's PEACH?! Where's Bowser?! Where's Laikitu? The only music from the film that I can relate to the game is the VERY beginning song... I believe that music in Mario games play a MAJOR role in setting the happy-go-lucky feel of the Mushroom Kingdom. Unfortunately, the film takes on a whole different direction and so the music is not applicable.(or at least that is the only reason why I think the catchy tunes from the games didn't get a reincarnation in some form in the film) I may have a different opinion if this film ISN'T call ""Super Mario Bros."" However, this film IS ""Super Mario Bros."", and it fails miserably at bringing the Mario World to life.My final say: Hollywood film makers should stay AWAY from the gaming industry. I know that getting hold of the right to make a film for a super famous series/title will probably be a shot at making A LOT of money... but this is unbearable.... All these attempts... all these GARBAGE that Hollywood is pumping out and slapping onto the film the title of some really popular game series/title... As a gamer, I feel like it's an insult to the gaming scene. List about 5-10 movies based on games... and tell me how many out of all those listed are even decent movies... It's hard isn't it? (personally, I can't name a single decent one that successfully brings the game world to life like expected.)",Super Mario Bros.
273,shinobirecca,one of my favorite movies of all time,10,18 June 2005,"Let me start off by saying that this is a great movie. Many people were expecting this movie to be piece for piece off of the video game which is pretty stupid considering that the Mario bros. games don't really have too much of a storyline besides just saving the princess from Koopa. The fact that they kept the basic ideas of the Mario games and added on their own take of it was great in my opinion. The actors were good and were perfect for their parts (especially Bob Hoskins). If people want to see a ""perfect"" Mario bros. movie where all there is too watch is a person jumping on monsters and going down pipes just because its true to the video game than please by all means go make one and see how many people don't fall asleep while watching it. I believe people should see it with an open mind instead of watching it hoping to see an exact replication of the game.",Super Mario Bros.

I hope they make a sequel with the new Characters like Wario, Waluigi, Baby Mario, Baby Luigi. they picked good actors and Actresses for the movie like Bob Hoskins (Mario),John Leguizamo (Luigi),Dennis Hopper (Koopa), Samantha Mathis (Daisy), Fisher Stevens (Iggy) and Richard Edson (Spike)thats my Opinion",Super Mario Bros.

If you watch the movie without an open mind then you just be sitting there complaining how far off from the video game. Dennis Hopper was a good villain in that movie, and John Leguizamo was awesome as Luigi. Watch with an open mind please. I'm tired of this being called a bad movie! This is a comedy. This is an action. This is a movie LOOSELY based on the game, not entirely. Besides those jump boots where pretty cool. Super Mario Bros. IS a good movie.OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO ooooo.",Super Mario Bros.

278,kaneyoderphone,"A Fun, Clever Adventure",10,12 September 2015,"Let me lay this out for you. I hadn't seen this movie in a while (years), found myself its IMDb page through the interwebs, started reading reviews of it and thought ""this can't be that bad!"" So promptly set to watch it online and it was easy to find. I don't regret an instant of it; I liked this movie more now as an adult than I did when I was a kid. Here's why:It's like one of these marvel movies that have been coming out recently: it's kind of cross between an ""adult's"" take and a ""children's"" take on a popular character. (Some other reviewer, or the trivia? had mentioned it) It's right in the middle. And the writing is great. Each scene flows logically to the next, and there's not much that's superfluous. Again it's got the fun of a children's movie mixed with the subtlety of an ""adult's"" movie. My greatest concern is why the Brooklyn girls aren't freaking out that they're in a parallel dimension. Sure when they find out Daisy is a princess they freak out, but not about the fact that they're in a PARALLEL DIMENSION. I mean if you really pay attention to the movie and get into it, just the visual aspects of this dystopian universe are worth it. You got smoke and sparks and wires and stretchy goo, people fighting, cars flipping, sheer madness. You've got the goofball pair of bad guys. You got dancing. You've got a romance between Luigi and Daisy that movies 3x as fast as Romeo and Juliet. You've got Mario knowing everything there is to know about pipes, including when to sled down them on a raft. You've got Yoshi, and at first you're disappointed, but then he turns out to be really cool. Did I mention King Koopa shooting flames out of a suspended bucket of coal? (Think Bowser in Super Mario World, and pay attention).A lot of people come away from the movie saying ""that was not a Mario movie,"" and can't come up with reasons why, except that it wasn't like the video game. I mean, crap; YOU try to write a script for Mario and make it compelling. Honestly there's not a lot to work with! Think about it. You got a guy and a kidnapped princess and an evil monster. Go write! But as much as the making of this of this film apparently sucked, I think they did a great job with what materials they had. tl;dr This movie is fun and actually clever, and I hope you watch it with an open mind!",Super Mario Bros.
279,ModestPoser,I'm a big Super Mario Bros. fan...,2,18 July 2005,"and I hated this movie. In my opinion, they've destroyed the characters. I believe that Luigi is younger than Mario in the movie, which is completely wrong. They thought Princess Toadstool (Now known as Peach) was Daisy. Again, this is wrong. When you watch this movie, you feel like it was written by someone who was sort of a fan of Super Mario, but never really got into the games. They've taken a creative, wonderful world and turned it into something which they thought would represent it. The Mushroom Kingdom could have been represented by itself. They also try to clear up some things which they thought didn't make sense in the movie. For example, they gave Mario and Luigi boots so they could jump really high. They were always able to do jump really high. They made Bowser seem like a corrupt mayor of some sort, and basically he doesn't even look like him. Even at the end, when he turns into a dinosaur, he does not look like Bowser. The Mario Bros. lived in Brooklyn in this movie, I think this is the first time that Mario was considered to be from Brooklyn. We don't know where Mario is from, so I guess this was a good choice that the film makers had to make.Don't see this movie if you're expecting something very accurate to the Super Mario Bros. series. See it, if you'd like a somewhat clever twist on the idea of Super Mario Bros.",Super Mario Bros.
280,nick123nm,Awesome in my opinion,8,22 July 2005,"Mario Brothers is like no other movie. Every part is filled with excitement and lots of fun adventure. It puts you into another world as the movie shifts into another dimension.The sets in the movie are unbelievable. The sets of Koopa's city are amazing with the detailed city streets that make it seem like an actual place. The ending makes it seem as if there is going to be a sequel but they never made a second one. Your probably either going to love this movie or think its pretty bad,depends on the person. I notice many goofs and still love it. I think it is a must own DVD.",Super Mario Bros.

I just found out, here, that there was a video game with the same name as this film. So, for me, there was NOTHING before seeing this film on television a few years ago. is this something bad? is, with any film we see, a bad thing that we haven't read the book or played the game, BEFORE we see the film? don't you think that this gives me a freedom to appreciate and enjoy a film just for what it is, a film? a freedom that otherwise would be hard to get? Super Mario Bros. was, as they say, a blast! for me... All made sense, it was fun to watch, the script is very good and with very good dialogues. it has good editing and good directing. it has very good costumes and set designs. it has very good visual effects. Acting is superb, especially with support characters. in fact, what is not to like? characters are not like in video game? what video game? monsters are still humans, not like in video game? what video game? jumping shoes are not like in video game? what video game? i repeat, i am 100% video game ignorant. oh, lucky me!",Super Mario Bros.

284,jupluna,Mario Bros. Luigi's the Man,10,28 December 2005,"This is not the movie for those of you too busy remembering the good old days of NES with Mario as the hero. This is Luigi's story (and yes...there was actually a game for Luigi...and guess what...his princess was Daisy.) Those that think this is all about the princess in pink, you are quite mistaken. This movie takes some of the classic game info (Yoshi, babombs, fungi, and two plumber brothers), and makes it more realistic. The world ends up splitting into two parts. One universe humans evolve from apes, in the other they evolve from Dinos. Koopa is attempting to merge the two worlds together and de-evolve the ape-humans.The movie is alternative universe, but as long as you aren't looking for Mario and Peach to be the hero and his love interest, then you should have no problem enjoying this movie.",Super Mario Bros.
285,nintendoeatsxboxforlunch,ignore the license and a movie which is at least worth the time and money is inside,8,5 March 2006,"no, wait!! don't hang up!! your back on? phew. good. OK, so obviously i am a Nintendo fanboy and so am theoretically biased. but I really didn't think this movie deserves the awful rap it's given. i mean, it has nothing to do with the games really (except for the SNES super scope and the character specifics, like names and such), so we can judge it more fully on it's own merits.the performances, firstly, are all pretty much what is expected. Hoskins is a little less happy-go-lucky than mario, but he looks the part and can still deliver a line like fed-ex can deliver a parcel (the last line was a paid advertisement by fed-ex. just kidding). everyone else is perfectly adequate, if often cheesy.The script is actually really interesting. there are all kinds of little tid-bits (i.e. president koopa orders a pizza and it is incidentally referred to several times afterwards, even though it really has no importance, the bob-omb at the end is wearing reebocks) which make this movie really different from other movies. the whole thing is also pretty much completely random. I won't get into details, but it's a lot like one of those teen Long-car-ride movies where there is an ultimate goal, but everything imaginable happens before you get there.so yeah, this movie is about a game, even though it really has nothing to do with it. that doesn't mean it's bad. it's actually really funny in a ridiculous sort of way.",Super Mario Bros.
286,chris16447,Why did Nintendo even sell the rights?,1,20 October 2005,"Nintendo, my favorite company, has betrayed me. Be then again, they didn't know that the creators of this movie would defile the game that made Nintendo an extremely successful video game company. But enough of that, let me tell you what is wrong with this movie: everything.First off, Super Mario Bros. (the game) takes place in the Mushroom Kingdom, a happy place that has been taken over by King Koopa (aka Bowser) and its people forced to mindlessly obey his will. Mario has to, of course, defeat Bowser to bring peace back to the Mushroom Kingdom. We all know that. The game DID NOT have cars, skyscrapers, or any obvious technology we enjoy today. Mario was a natural high jumper, and he worked alone.The movie, however, is just a lame action movie with a few Mario allusions thrown in to attract Nintendo fans. The Mario allusion consist solely of: Mario, Luigi, and Daisy's names, enemy names, and a bomb-omb. Yay. Oh, and Yoshi, in a 5-second cameo as a dinosaur too small to even consider riding on. But Mario can't jump, no, he's a Brooklyn plumber with a Columbian brother! (How'd that happen?). Their personalities aren't even right. In the games, Mario is a determined hero with a heart of gold, willing to do anything to save the day. Luigi is his shy brother, who helps Mario in any way he can, but in a minimal sort of way. In the movie, they act more like best friends than brothers, Mario is annoyed by everything, and Luigi has a temper.If you like plots quickly written up on napkins before the check comes, and complete destruction of all that Mario stands for, then see this movie. If you are under the age of 12 and have never played a Mario game in your life, then proceed with caution. If you have EVER played a Mario game in your life, take all measures NOT to see this movie. Remember, you cannot sue if this movie totally makes you cry uncontrollably for many hours, trust me, I've tried.",Super Mario Bros.

I have a very close connection with it having seen it probably over 100 times. I've watched this movie on New Years so the clock strikes midnight when they high five in the elevator. I've made out to many girlfriends with this playing in the background. I've recited the script to my friends when we had nothing to do. I brought the DVD to college with me. I've met Samantha Mathis who plays Daisy and got her autograph. I completed the full set of trading cards. I've spoke to John Leguizamo about the movie. The movie is super awesome and is a fantastic look on a series about a middle aged italian man jumping on goombas and hitting his head on blocks. It was a futuristic cyberpunk take on manhattan and a tyrannical oppressive government that is stopped by the average working man. The set is freaking awesome and the acting is done wonderfully, especially by the late Bob Hoskins and Dennis Hopper.

The creators just added their own twists, and I like that. The movie kept the some of the classic characters from the game as well (B-bombs, Goomba's, Yoshi, Daisy, and Koopa himself). I'm glad that Koopa doesn't look like a big turtle that breathes fire. That would have been terrible. I like the cast, too. I don't remember the actors names, but they did a good job on it.
