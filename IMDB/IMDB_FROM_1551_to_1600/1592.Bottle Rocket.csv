0,MartinHafer,A very long and low-key joke---and certainly NOT for all tastes.,6,1 January 2013,"I have seen several of Wes Anderson's films and think they certainly are NOT for all tastes. Some I really liked--such as ""The Royal Tannenbaums"" and ""Moonrise Kingdom"". Some I did not like--such as ""The Life Aquatic With Steve Zissou"". But one thing these films all have in common is a very slow (glacially slow) pace and very, very quirky characters and dialog. Because of that, it might be worth seeing this film simply because there ain't anything like it! The film has a plot but doesn't really get to it until the last quarter of the film! Up until then, the plot just meanders very slowly and mostly consists of the Wilson brothers (Owen and Luke) doing lots of seemingly irrelevant things up until they go on a heist (such as a long and directionless road trip). This lack of direction certainly will annoy most viewers though the acting was quite nice. Eventually, the heist does take place and the film improves SIGNIFICANTLY. I liked how incredibly inept and stupid the robbery turned out to be. But, again, at times it also seemed to meander.So did I like the film? Well, I am not sure. SOME of it I liked and much of it seemed in need of editing. At least it gave me a chance to see Anderson's and the Wilson brothers' first full-length film.By the way, ""Bottle Rocket"" was originally a short film (1994). If you watch it, you can see a lot of the later feature and it is interesting to see how the short morphed into the full-length film.",Bottle Rocket
1,SnoopyStyle,Good start to unique visionary career,6,23 November 2013,"Anthony (Luke Wilson) is released from a mental institution and hooks up with his friend Dignan (Owen Wilson) who hatches a scheme to rob his former boss Mr Henry (James Caan). Anthony falls for motel maid Inez (Lumi Cavazos).This is the first big screen attempt for director Wes Anderson. It has flashes of his unique style already. It has the camera work, some quirks and the music. However the story is a rambling mess of aimless people. While the group of friends have some quirks, they're not weird enough to be funny. The Wilson brothers are showing their charismatic banter. It's a charming indie where everybody is trying their best and having a bit of fun.",Bottle Rocket
2,gavin6942,The Promise is Evident in this Early Wilson-Anderson Film,7,30 August 2006,"This is not the best Wilson/Anderson film. I mean, ""Tenenbaums"" or ""Life Aquatic"" or ""Rushmore"" are all probably better films. But considering this was the beginning of it all (before Ben Stiller), you can see in each scene that these three men were going to change the way we view comedies in America. (Think about your favorite comedies of the past 10 years and see how many have a Wilson brother.) In this one, two friends go out to become professional bandits. But things don't make it very far as one falls for a Paraguayan woman and their getaway driver gets away. The plot might be thin, but that has never really been the point if you are familiar with the antics of these men. The Wilsons need no plot.I enjoyed how much Owen Wilson seemed un-Owen. He had a very different sort of character than usual, more aggressive and unstable. It was a nice change. The Inez character was also very nice, someone you could feel bad for yet admire. The scene where Luke Wilson begins to fall for her is endearing and cute in that ""puppy dog"" way.Nothing more to say... watch this film. Unless of course you hated ""Tenenbaums"", ""Rushmore"" and ""Life Aquatic"" (and I admit some people don't care for them). If you don't like those, this one will bore you to tears. (By the way, also watch ""The Squid and the Whale""... Wes Anderson produced it and he could use a few extra bucks.)",Bottle Rocket
3,lee_eisenberg,Wes Anderson starts,8,28 August 2017,"If you've come of age in the 21st century, then you know Wes Anderson as one of the most important indie directors. His oeuvre (Rushmore, The Royal Tenenbaums, The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou, The Darjeeling Limited, Moonrise Kingdom, The Grand Budapest Hotel) features quirky characters, scenes with centered action, and generally unusual plots. And he tends to cast Bill Murray in supporting roles.His debut, 1996's ""Bottle Rocket"", is a little different. Bill Murray is absent. There are a few scenes with centered action, but the emphasis is certainly on the characters and plot. Owen and Luke Wilson play friends who plan a series of heists. I found the best part of the movie to be the whole sequence in the motel; the heists themselves came across as secondary to the events in the motel.So, while it doesn't give that much of a hint of Anderson's later movies, ""Bottle Rocket"" is still an enjoyable one. James Caan's character struck me as an allusion to his most famous one. And Kumar Pallana accomplished something practically unheard of: he debuted in cinema when he was pushing eighty.""Tell him I love him."" Ha!",Bottle Rocket
4,Woodyanders,"Crime doesn't pay, but it sure can be funny",9,21 November 2006,"Hyper, fast talking and wildly delusional day dreamer Dignan (a wonderfully lively and engaging performance by Owen Wilson) persuades his more laid-back best friend Anthony (the equally likable Luke Wilson) and their meek, mopey buddy Bob (an amusingly morose Robert Musgrove) to join up with him and become a crack criminal outfit. Naturally, things don't go exactly as planned, with comically disastrous results for all concerned.Acclaimed indie director Wes Anderson's debut feature is one of those subtle little comic beauties that doesn't really seem like much as you watch it, but gets funnier and more resonant when you reflect on it after seeing it. It has its own uniquely sweet and eccentric low-key charm, a certain offhanded grace and understated style that's both endearing and enjoyable in comparable measure. The smart and astute script by Anderson and Wilson shows a genuine warmth and affinity for this personable trio of lovable slacker losers with big time ambitions and no actual ability to effectively realize said ambitions. Standard crime film conventions are cleverly turned on their ear. For example, our blundering and constantly bickering threesome resort to crime not out of necessity, but out of misguided desire and sheer desperation; they're just trying to alleviate the numbing tedium of their drab, safe and comfortable suburbanite existences. The robbery sequences are simply sidesplitting, with our boys proving beyond a reasonable doubt that they just aren't ideal and suitable candidates for a life of crime (the book store caper is absolutely priceless). Better still, both Wilson brothers and Musgrove are terrific in the leads, with superb support from Lumi Cavazos as a nice and pretty Mexican motel maid Anthony falls in love with, Andrew Wilson as Bob's browbeating tool of a brother Future Man, and especially James Caan as hearty, jovial local ""crime boss"" Mr. Henry. Mark Mothersbaugh's breezy score and Bob Yeoman's bright, fluid, dynamic and picturesque cinematography are both on the money excellent. The leisurely pacing takes a little getting used to, but once you get into the film's quirky groove the movie overall proves to be a real fresh, funny and above all inspired and original treat.",Bottle Rocket
5,blanche-2,Three would-be criminals on an adventure,7,26 February 2017,"Bottle Rocket from 1996 stars the Wilson brothers - Owen, Luke, and Andrew, with a script co-written by Owen and Wes Anderson. The film also stars James Caan.The story concerns a group of friends at loose ends who embark on a life of crime at the instigation of Dignan (Owen). Anthony (Luke) has just escaped from a voluntary mental hospital -- he could have walked out, but instead he slid to the ground on a sheet. Dignan (Owen) is the ringleader with a series of instructional notebooks; Bob (Robert Musgrave) has a car so he's the lookout and driver.They knock over a few stores and wind up at a motel where Anthony falls for a maid and feels it's been a life-changing experience. Then Bob's brother is arrested as a drug dealer, so he takes off in his car to help him, leaving the other two stranded. And so it goes.Very funny - Wes Anderson is great at this type of offbeat comedy. The comedy comes out of the characterizations rather than the lines. The best is toward the end when Owen takes charge of a big caper. Enjoy this.",Bottle Rocket
6,Quinoa1984,"perhaps the most innocent heist movie ever, with great characters",10,4 February 2009,"Bottle Rocket's plot isn't very heavy. Doesn't need to be; for Wes Anderson's first film he takes partly (in theory) a cue from Michael Cimino's Thunderbolt and Lightfoot. There too were the real oddball outsider characters, looking for a leg up but not with the same kind of zeal of a real hard-bitten criminal or neo-noir. In Bottle Rocket there's an ex-volunteer at an insane asylum and a guy who works for a landscaping company and the two are thick as thieves- only they're not good at actually being thieves, with one or two moments of exception. And yet Anderson doesn't mine for the easy parts for comic effect. His sense of humor is in the small things, little character traits or a moment that pops out.It may depend on how one sees the characters, and how much one is a fan of the Wilson brothers, Luke and Owen. But what Anderson does capture is that innocent feeling of being unsure of life and the things that make friendships kind of awkward at times. The three ""criminals"", played by Anthony, Dignan and Bob bicker and converse and do whatever like normal folk, not real gangsters like, say, Mr Henry (James Caan), but they aspire to that, and Dignan gets the closest. Meanwhile, on the lam from a robbery of a bookstore, Anthony falls for a Peruvian housemaid and Bob has his own worries with his backyard pot growth. Their appeal, really, is in how the interactions are based around a solid theme of loyalty and friendship, and the film-making takes it to another level.It's hard to say if I found this a really great comedy- there's a few big laughs, one with a hilarious botch during a climactic robbery with a shot at someone unexpected, and little ones like a PB&J just lifted off the ground or a bad encounter at a country club- but it's an unusually amazing heist-character-drama. Well, drama of sorts; it's the Wes Anderson style already in full mode, and it's exhilarating to watch him make 90 minutes feel a lot fuller, a lot more alive than most at such a running time. I also liked the Wilson brothers, with the both of them in their breakout roles completely on top with their subtle, zany and quietly crazy roles. Loved the music, the cinematography, but most of all the emphasis on character over plot. In heist movies, or just young/lost-20-something generation movies, it's rarely this good.",Bottle Rocket
7,LeonLouisRicci,Wes Anderson NewbiesDon't Start With This One,8,24 July 2014,"Rookie Director Wes Anderson Delivers a Deadpan, Dead On Arrival Movie that Fizzled at the Box Office and took Critics by Surprise. It was so Laid-Back in its Slackerness that it Suffered to make a Blip on the Radar of the Intelligentsia and Bored Casual Moviegoers to Death. Anderson is an Acquired Taste if He becomes Tasty at all. To this Day His Against the Grain Films are Talked About Intensely and Loved and Hated with Equal Enthusiasm. But in Retrospect it's Hard to Ignore a Film that Martin Scorsese called ""One of the best Films of the Nineties"".But Mostly Ignored it was and its Lukewarm at Best Receivership did Little to Boost the Confidence of Writer/Star Owen Wilson. But He and the Director Soldiered On because they were both Obviously Full of Self-Confidence Concerning Their Offbeat Vision of Film Comedy.This Movie is about as Inoffensive as Any Modern Comedy and it is with that Refreshing Style where it Makes its Mark. It is a Film that is Thinking all the time and Plays Out Typical Movie Stuff like Quirky Romances (that need an interpreter) and Street Level Criminals that Really should Find Another Line of Work.This is a Soft Heist Film and the Charm is in the Realness of its Characters and Their Unpretentious Take on Life. A Gaudy Jump Suit may be a Subconscious Wish Fulfillment for Dignan and He Brings His Friends Along with His Energetic Naivete. Note...If you have never seen a Wes Anderson Movie and wonder what all the fuss is about, its best to not start here. He is one of those Auteurs where it might be better to watch His Films in reverse chronological order. Makes perfect upside-down sense really.",Bottle Rocket
8,Boba_Fett1138,Gets old- and runs out of steam too early.,6,11 June 2011,"Even though I'm just not a Wes Anderson fan I was liking this movie at first. However it soon started to become obvious that the movie wasn't heading anywhere and all of its 'jokes' and its light laid back kind of atmosphere was starting to get old and annoying after a while.I like quirky but Wes Anderson is simply always overdoing things. He thinks it is enough to give a character a funny name and let him stare or walk. This still works for about 30 minutes (which much have been the reason I liked the shorter and earlier 1994 version of ""Bottle Rocket"" way better) but it starts to get old pretty soon. Especially when nothing else is really happening in its script with its story and characters.This really disappointed me. It's one of those movies that tries to be as simple and realistic as possible, like independent movies often tend to do. Like a random slice of life, except with the problem that it just isn't that interesting to follow for 90 minutes long. It attempts to make even its most crazy events look realistic, which is a part of Wes Anderson his sort of comedy but I would had liked to get some more substance in this case. I just got nothing out of watching this movie.This really feels like a movie that got made by a bunch of student buddies, who went out to shoot a movie. In some way that also really was the case with this movie actually. Wes Anderson, as well as the Owen brothers (who strangely enough don't play brothers in this movie) were basically fresh out of school when they did this movie and it was their first full length production. In that regard you perhaps have to give some respect and credits to this movie. It paved the way for their careers and it's also somewhat fun to see how they haven't really deviated away from their own style, ever since.Good for its first 30 minutes or so but after that it starts to run out of steam fast.6/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",Bottle Rocket
9,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,Just barely OK,6,5 June 2004,"This movie is really a lot less funny that what I would expect from a funny guy like Owen Wilson... it has few funny jokes, most of the material just falls flat. The gags are also a bit lame, half of the time. It also seems to throw in to much love drama for a supposed comedy. The plot is OK, but the movie goes at such a slow pace that I almost fell asleep out of boredom. It barely entertains at all, using mostly used material. The acting is OK, but nothing special. The humor seems tired and worn out, it rarely gets as much as a smile out of me. It does have a few mildly amusing scenes though, among others, several of the robbery scenes had me laughing a little, at least. The whole romance thing never works when it's worked into the movie as clumsily as it is here. It also seemed so misplaced in this film; it might have worked had it been done with just a little bit more seriousness, in fact, the whole film would have had to have been more serious. Either that, or the romance had to be dumbed down. It just doesn't work well here. I recommend this to fans of Owen Wilson who really love his films, otherwise you probably won't like it much. I know I didn't. 6/10",Bottle Rocket
10,deloudelouvain,Not hilarious but watchable.,6,30 April 2019,"I wouldn't say this is the best comedy with Owen Wilson but for his debut it isn't bad. It's not hilarious, far from that, but the clumsy crime relationship with his brother Luke Wilson is entertaining to watch. The story that Owen Wilson wrote with his friend Wes Anderson is a bit goofy, never saw such amateurs as bandits, but it's watchable. I didn't get bored and that's already something, but I wasn't overwhelmed either. In fact I'm glad I watched Bottle Rocket but it's only going to be for one time, no need to watch it again as for that it's not good enough.",Bottle Rocket
11,StevePulaski,"Doesn't explode, yet isn't a dud",6,5 June 2012,"The story of Wes Anderson's Bottle Rocket goes a little something like this. Anderson shot a thirteen minute short film, featuring the three leads of this picture, showed it at Sundance, got the attention of filmmaker James L. Brooks, and he was one of the seven producers on the film adaptation of the short. While a box office failure, the picture launched the reputations of both Luke and Owen Wilson as actors and Wes Anderson has an eclectic director.We are taken to the upper-class Texas suburbs where Dignan (Owen Wilson) breaks his brother Anthony (Wilson) out of a mental hospital, and plan to conduct a series of elaborate heists with their friend Bob (Musgrave). Their goal is to challenge life in suburbia and rebel against the norms of recurring, everyday life. Haven't we heard that before.After they stage a pitiful robbery at a bookstore, the three ""go on the lam"" at a hotel. While there, Anthony meets and falls in love with a housekeeper named Ines (Cavazos), and Dignan fears that with Bob's continued incompetence and lack of loyalty, along with Anthony's lovestruck ways that their dreams of being robbers are over.One thing I was immediately impressed with was the warm look Bottle Rocket accompanies throughout its runtime. It's common to have a layer of cynicism in movies, but it seems that Wes Anderson's directorial effort is determined to fine the whimsicality of movies, the softness of their appearance, and the overall genial aspect of film itself. In short, the film always looks crisp and gentle. Not to mention, the actors are all flavorful, with both the Wilson brothers giving rather memorable performances, and the late appearance of James Caan is a pretty nice addition to the film.Though some marginally convincing performances, warmth, and identifiable whimsicality can not entirely elevate a picture, and that is where Anderson's Bottle Rocket flounders. It's so thin and trudges through its ninety minute runtime at a sluggish pace. The dialog scenes are nice, but rather uninvolving, as we learn that these characters truly have no motives of robbing random places other than to be difficult and stand out. As a whole, the film starts off slow, becomes vaguely amusing for a brief amount of time, before the experience ends and the whole thing is quickly forgotten. Sort of like a bottle rocket itself.Starring: Luke Wilson, Owen Wilson, Robert Musgrave, Lumi Cavazos, and James Caan. Directed by: Wes Anderson.",Bottle Rocket
12,=G=,It ain't easy being a crook.,7,22 April 2002,"In the off-the-wall comedy ""Bottle Rocket"", Owen Wilson makes a scintillating debut as the creative force behind this tale of one man's struggle to realize his dream of becoming a crook in spite of his many shortcomings: sensitivity, compassion, empathy, and just plain niceness. Luke Wilson plays straight man to real life brother Owen in this camp, light-hearted, and easy to watch little film about the ""gang who couldn't think straight"". A fun watch for just about anyone into droll humorous subtleties.",Bottle Rocket
13,paul2001sw-1,Dumbness for smart people,7,18 November 2007,"Wes Anderson's films are original, silly and deadpan. This one, an early effort, is about a trio of young men (one of them Owen Wilson, who is excellent as the gang leader) who rebel against their comfortable backgrounds to take up a life of crime, inspired by the criminal boss of a local landscape gardening company. It is funny - sort of - but a lot of the humour is very knowing, lying less in the story itself but rather in the way that the movie presents it without directly acknowledging its inherent ridiculousness. The result is fresh, but without any real emotional punch; it's enjoyable to watch, but there is a reason all movies aren't like this one.",Bottle Rocket
14,Pjtaylor-96-138044,"The first ""wow"".",5,3 December 2018,"The highlight of 'Bottle Rocket (1996)' is a frustratingly hectic heist sequence that demonstrates the potential entertainment that could've come from what's essentially a claustrophobic, 'quirky' and character-driven 'road-trip'. Sadly, though, the film is so unfocused and slow that it's difficult to understand its ultimate point. It's only enjoyable on occasion and it's just fine the rest of the time. Really, it seems like the original short was stretched to feature length to nothing other than detriment, unfortunately diluting what one can only assume was evocative of the best content seen here into an overall quite dull and perplexing experience. 5/10",Bottle Rocket
15,kenjha,Light-hearted but Lame Comedy,4,1 February 2013,"In this debut feature of the writing team of Anderson and Owen Wilson, friends go on a crime spree. This started as a short and it does feel like too little material stretched too thin. Many good comedies are quirky. Quirky can be good. Quirky can be funny. Quirky doesn't work if it has to work by itself. It's obvious from the situations and the characters that this is meant to be a comedy, but there's hardly a chuckle to be had here. It's quirk without humor. At least the actors are trying hard. Whatever his failings as a writer, Owen Wilson brings a lot of energy to his role, and brother Luke is likable here, but it's not enough. It's light-hearted, but it's also lame.",Bottle Rocket
16,paulclaassen,"Sorry, not for me...",2,14 January 2019,"I love Wes Anderson's films and decided to watch them all. Unfortunately I can't say I enjoyed this one. The film bears none of the Anderson trademarks, camera angles, or interesting use of color and props he became famous for. Well, I suppose every great director had to start somewhere, this being his first feature.'Bottle Rocket' is based on a short, directed by Anderson. It just didn't work as a 90-minute feature, as a lot of the time is made up by trivial actions and way too much dialogue. Oh, and was the love interest in the form of Anthony and Inez supposed to be romantic? In so many films, lust is confused with love. This is another example where the 'romance' is pure lust and about sexual gratification.The plot carries very little substance, and the final act is beyond stupid. This film seriously has very little to offer, except dialogue in abundance!",Bottle Rocket
17,Floated2,A great start to Wes Anderson's career,8,9 October 2010,"This was the first feature film from Wes Anderson, and his films have matured since his first. Bottle Rocket is a rather simple plot but thats sorta a good thing. Also the characters are likable (esp. Owen Wilson as Dignan), the dialogue is good, the story is pretty interesting, and the film doesn't try to be funny. The humour in this film is great- not laugh out loud funny but there are funny moments involving the situations and within the dialogue. The film was rated R but it was a light R rated film. There's not much violence and the language consists of only seven f-bombs. Though I felt that the ending could have been stronger and it seemed like an ending that was meant for a sequel. It left some questions unanswered. It may not be Anderson's best film but its still pretty good and a great time to fill in 90 minutes. So, Id recommend it to those who are fans of Wes Anderson and who have yet to see the film. As a rewatch 09/04/19' this film as somewhat as remembered. Nothing too memorable but a good solid film to pass the time. The comedy is genuine and not forced and the the overall short run time keeps it entertaining and constantly going. Solid pacing.",Bottle Rocket
18,Movie_Muse_Reviews,Anderson and the Wilsons' firsts highlight their strengths in this likable film,6,24 July 2008,"Movies about obscure characters doing obscure things can be pretty hit or miss. The key is tying that obscurity into something that people can understand and relate to. With ""Bottle Rocket,"" Wes Anderson (in his very first cinematic credits) establishes that he understands this must be done and he does it with relationships. While ""Bottle Rocket"" may not be all that poignant or satisfy the tastes of all movie watchers, it certainly does offer its own style of entertainment. For those familiar with Anderson's more mainstream work, this is a film that brings some insight into how he established himself as a revered director.Let's not forget the Wilson brothers either. Both Owen and Luke can thank this film for being a great resume starter. It highlights the very talents that they took with them all the way to the bank in the last ten years. Luke is Anthony Adams, a lovable, naive guy who finds himself in trouble thanks to those around him, namely Owen's character Dignan, the quirky, high-aimer who takes things to a comically serious level. You see attributes of these characters echo in nearly every role they've played since this film gave them a spotlight. Together, the two are small time crooks who consider themselves professionals and set out with their friend Bob only to further reveal to the viewer that they have no talent whatsoever. There's not a whole lot driving this plot. While part of that is the point, more could actually happen to make things interesting. Instead, this is mostly focused on how the characters all deal with their collective ineptitude. They argue like most friends argue, only most friends aren't amateur thieves. Like Anderson's films after this, the characters all wrestle between a group or family mentality and their individual desires. It's very easy to see for anyone who has seen most of Anderson's work. Fortunately for him, these characters and dilemmas only get stronger and more interesting as his career progresses.The film is also not much of a comedy. While Anderson never has done traditional comedy, the laughs come at the expense of some of the strange characters. They're not nearly strange enough to be consistently funny. Instead, the characters and the whole film is likable, but that's about where it stops. It never gets beyond likable. At least likable is better than bad and this film is definitely leaves a good taste in your mouth.",Bottle Rocket
19,BeneCumb,"Sweet entertainment, but not very funny",7,15 July 2012,"The Wilsons have their typical roles/characters: losers with big mouth, neurotic actions and unrealistic hopes. You start to feel sorry for them in many ways as - in spite of being small-scale crooks - they are not mean or evil. Small people try to do something big and solve their problems, but they create additional ones in turn - and for others as well.The plot has its interesting twists, the developments are quite slow - and do not expect to have good laughs. In some ways, it reminded me several Woody Allen's movies. Not so deep and profound, but more interesting, however.",Bottle Rocket
20,runamokprods,A strong debut for Wes Anderson,7,19 September 2016,"While, for me, this isn't up to the level of many of Anderson's best films to come, this rambling, likable and good-natured oddball shaggy dog story, packs in some real emotion to go with laughs along the way. It's full of terrific understated performances, and good use of images and music.I recently watched it a 2nd time and thought I wasn't all that into it... until near the end, when it suddenly got me on a deeper level emotionally than on first viewing. There's something in it about the loss of childhood dreams that resonates beyond the silly and playful surface. Always a good sign when a film deepens with time and re-visiting.Of course Criterion do their usual great job with both the transfer and the extras, and seeing the original short film is very interesting and a lot of fun in it's own right.Anderson has gone on to become one of our most important film-makers, and if this first film doesn't represent him as quite at full speed yet, it's still well worth seeing in terms of both entertainment and recent film history.",Bottle Rocket
21,estebangonzalez10,Anderson and Wilson establishing their reputations,7,13 April 2014,"""I learned more in the 2 months I spent with Mr. Henry and this crew than I learned in 15 years of academic study.""Bottle Rocket was not only the feature film debut for director Wes Anderson, but it was also the debut for Owen and Luke Wilson who both gave inspiring performances. This is where it all started for Wes Anderson and despite not being a box office hit he slowly built a reputation for himself by remaining unique to his quirky sense of humor. Many criticized the fact that these characters didn't seem real, and that is probably true for all of Anderson's film where he focuses on dysfunctional characters with a whimsical sense of humor. Anderson's comedies are very different and they aren't for mainstream audiences, thus the reason why the screening of this film scored the worst test screening points in the history of Columbia Pictures during that time. I am glad Wes stayed true to his style and didn't sell out because his next films share similar trademarks which he began establishing in Bottle Rocket. This is perhaps his most normal looking film if you take into account the cinematography, but the quirky sense of humor is pretty much the same as well as some other technical aspects of the film (the font title cards at the beginning and the slow motion shot at the end). The same can be said for Owen Wilson who kind of plays this dumb but nice guy character in most of his comedies. It's not Anderson's best work, but his quirky style began taking shape with Bottle Rocket. The screenplay was co-written by Wes Anderson and Owen Wilson from a short they had made a couple of years earlier. The film opens with Dignan (Owen Wilson) trying to help his best friend, Anthony (Luke Wilson) escape from a mental institution. Dignan has designed a great escape plan, but what he doesn't know is that Anthony can leave the institution upon his free will considering he voluntarily signed up for it after he had a nervous breakdown from exhaustion. This opening scene clearly establishes that Dignan is less sane than Anthony. He has established a long term plan for the two involving a criminal spree. The first step is robbing Anthony's mother's house but they can only take a few valueless items. The idea is that they get some criminal experience so they can catch the attention of Dignan's former boss, Mr. Henry (James Caan), who is sort of a legend in the criminal world. Next they plan a bookstore robbery, but this time they will need a getaway driver so they convince their friend Bob (Robert Musgrave) to join them. After successfully achieving their plan they hide out at a nearby motel where Anthony falls deeply in love with a Paraguayan maid named Inez (Lumi Cavazos). This is where the dysfunctional group of friends breaks down and things take a turn for each one of them.Bottle Rocket was on Martin Scorsese's list of his top 10 favorite movies of the 90's. The quirky sense of humor isn't for everyone, but fans of Wes Anderson's comedies will really enjoy this considering it was the birthing point of some of his technical achievements. It may be less depressing and cynical in tone than some of his other comedies, but the whimsy characters he creates are very familiar. You can clearly see the fascination he has for exploring these dysfunctional relationships of dorky middle to upper class people. It's a refreshing film and very different from your standard buddy comedy. It's witty and despite not having many hilarious moments, the film does manage to keep a smile on your face for most of its runtime. For a debut performance Owen Wilson really shines on screen and delivers his lines with perfect timing. I really enjoyed this offbeat comedy although I wouldn't recommend this to anyone who isn't a fan of Wes Anderson. I always recommend my favorite, The Royal Tenenbaums, to people who haven't seen any of his film.",Bottle Rocket
22,alansabljakovic-39044,What a great start,8,10 October 2019,Anderson's first movie and I absolutely loved it. I love his iconic costumes and everything is so colorful. I love the absurdity of dialogues and Owen Wilson's first movie performance. Can't wait for The French Dispatch.,Bottle Rocket

24,Galina_movie_fan,"""you're gonna see a side of Dignan that you haven't seen before. A sick, sadistic side""",7,11 September 2007,"""Bottle Rocket (1996), the first feature by Wes Anderson has become a cult favorite, and made the names of Anderson and Wilson's (three brothers, Owen, Luke, and Andrew acted in the picture, and Owen, the self-proclaimed troublemaker co-wrote the script with Anderson) popular, and their fans waiting for more. BR is an offbeat crime/comedy about three friends, Dignan (Owen), Anthony (Luke), and Bob (Robert Musgrave) who tried to pursue the career of the professional criminals. If ever three screw-up characters were less suited for becoming tough guys, thieves or bank robbers, I am yet to see them on the screen. Of all three, Dignan takes the cake - his brazenness, ineptitude, clumsiness and lack of any sense of reality in the combination with the true believe that he was born to become a ""made man"" (or something like that) and that the local ""godfather"" Mr. Henry (James Caan in a very funny cameo) would take him and his friends seriously are absolutely adorable. Andrew Wilson, the oldest of three brothers has a small role as Bob's obnoxious older brother. I personally don't think that ""Bottle Rocket"" is a masterpiece and the best movie of that year but it certainly has got some very funny moments, especially in the beginning (Dignan helps Anthony to run from a mental hospital and soon they pull a job of robbing the local book store; Dignan interviews Bob for a position of a runaway driver) and in the end when three friends are sent by Mr. Henry to the biggest (and the most hilarious) heist that would be the apotheosis of their careers. Owen Wilson's Dignan is a reason enough to see the movie - so hilariously deadly serious about his absurd plans, schemes, and ideas he is.",Bottle Rocket
25,RainDogJr,"""you gotta get me one of these jumpsuits""",10,5 January 2009,"Life is what happens to you while you're busy making other plans. - John LennonThis one, Bottle Rocket, the first feature film of Wes Anderson is also and certainly Owen and Luke Wilson's very first feature and for a reason I had in my head that Dignan and Anthony (Owen and Luke Wilson's characters respectively) were brothers! After all they do were almost like brothers, they were a team, a team that never accomplished anything really big but that at least became a true team. Not very long time ago I watched the Woody Allen film Take the Money and Run and by watching Bottle Rocket I remembered that Allen film. So they are a team here and Dignan leader and the one with the ideas, with the plans, he has all planned for like the next fifty years! But once you see him in action well you will remember Woody Allen in Take the Money and Run, basically Dignan, during the heist to a bookstore, ends talking to the manger of the bookstore with a lot of respect! But well the three now are ""fugitives"", both Dignan and Anthony and Bob (the only one who has a car) but is not yet a team, basically one will be in love, the other will be worry because of a family situation and the other is the only one who still is in the team. This film has what is probably the very best performance of Owen Wilson, he is usually very funny but here he is simply superb. He plays a very strange and very memorable character, Dignan is more or less like a big kid when is time for his plans and stuff, he is a likable character since the very first scene of the film, sometimes he takes himself very seriously, Grace (Anthony's little sister) defines Dignan very well: ""I do like Dignan but he's a liar"". At one point these two ""brothers"" will take different roads for whatever reasons, the fact is that Anthony will have a complete change in his life. We meet Anthony during his last day at a mental hospital, he was there because he wanted to be there, we know that is certainly a difficult time for him, he is unhappy but this will change. I think the scene that sort of defines Anthony is when he is together with Inez (Lumi Cavazos), the housekeeper of the hotel that they were staying in, in the laundry room, he is just fascinated feeling something that certainly was unexpected. So the team is now the least important thing for Anthony and when he returns to home he starts a new productive routine and with that he has no time to think if Inez love him or not or in anything from the past. Dignan is back in Anthony's life, certainly another plan but is Anthony in? he knows he has now something more but again is Dignan, a great scene, Anthony sees sort of a resume of how is Dignan's life, he is in and Bob too. Very hilarious but certainly also sad, the last part of the film is that as well as the entire film. Each member of the team ended very well with the others but only each member of the original team, the plan turned to be a mess, Dignan ended in jail with a sentence of 2 years (that scene in which Dignan tries to escape but finally is arrested by the police is simply a superb one, the music was great, one of my favourites scenes) Bob ended without most of his things but they ended as a real team, after all they're not really criminals but everybody's got to have a dream. Watch this one, probably my favourite Anderson film (up there with The Royal Tenenbaums) and hell it has James Cann (as a clever swine!).PD: recently I visited Roger Ebert's website and in the main page there is part of his review for the film Revolutionary Road and he wrote at the beginning the John Lennon phrase LIFE IS WHAT HAPPENS TO YOU WHILE YOU'RE BUSY MAKING OTHER PLANS. I liked that phrase and I thought was right for this film. Anyway, Ebert gave to Bottle Rocket only 2 stars (and to Rushmore, the other Anderson film that for me gets a 10, only 2 and half stars) while for Martin Scorsese Bottle Rocket was the number 7 of his ""best films of the 1990's"" list from ""ROGER EBERT & THE MOVIES"" show #1426.",Bottle Rocket
26,framptonhollis,entertaining indie comedy,7,12 March 2017,"With its bright colors, subtle sense of humor, and quirky characters, ""Bottle Rocket"" certainly contains the essence of Wes Anderson's later films. Although his style wasn't fully developed until ""Rushmore"" in 1998, ""Bottle Rocket"" works as a sort of glance at the development of this style. Perhaps the shots aren't as centered, and the soundtrack isn't as jam packed with classic rock, but its still a great, fun Wes Anderson movie. ""Bottle Rocket"" is mainly known today for being the feature length debut of popular indie filmmaker Wes Anderson, and perhaps it would not be nearly as interesting if Anderson did not have a subsequent career, but ""Bottle Rocket"" is still a pretty awesome movie nonetheless. The humor is, more often then not, really hilarious, clever, and subtle. The audience is not bombarded with clichés and predictable punchlines, but instead is given a feast of slight quirks and oddities that arise when these particular characters are put into these particular situations. The film also has plenty of heart and drama. The characters aren't just vehicles for jokes and slapstick, they are people with issues and goals, relationships and enemies. They argue, fight, hang out, and engage in small talk-it's a very refreshing comedy-and, simply put, a highly enjoyable one.",Bottle Rocket
27,p-stepien,Anderson - The beginning,2,21 December 2012,"Two life-clumsy friends Anthony (Luke Wilson) and Dignam (Owen Wilson) venture into a joint bird-brained heist (starting their new career by robbing Dignam's mother). Anthony was recently released from an asylum after a nervous breakdown, but in truth seems to offer more justifiable claims to sanity. Nonetheless, despite reservations, Anthony agrees to assist Dignam in his ploys together with ultra-moronic neighbour and getaway driver Bob (Robert Musgrave). After a semi-successful steal the threesome decide to hide out in a roadside motel until the dust settles. There Anthony falls deeply for the non-English-speaking Mexican maid Inez (Lumi Cavazos), thus necessitating a rewrite to the hapless plans he has already conceived.The feature length debut is much of the what Wes Anderson has incorporated into his trademark career as the king of quirkiness. Despite several attempts and a watch of every Anderson movie conceivable his critical appeal remains a mystery to myself, and ""Bottle Rocket"", arguably the most chaotic and purposeless story from the director was an undeniable torment to watch. With the whole middle of the story a misplaced filler, which attempts to expand the same-titled short film into a feature, the whole affair is tiresome, only really catching fire in the first and in the final act. Overall watchable for the first 30 minutes, afterwards the shenanigans at the motel with absolutely no focus derail any construed interest in the premise. Not intent on heading anywhere Anderson basically offers a collage of laid back quirky individuals trying to eek out a laugh, instead increasingly causing the Wilson brothers to become irritatingly overwhelming.Without much more on offer than odd-balls and oddities this is Wes Anderson's worst movie, which won't win over any of his doubters, who are best to look for other of his works to decide on whether Anderson's trademark quirk-attacks are 'no-no' or 'gung-ho'. For me personally the achingly convention subversive capers, the indulgent humour and the goofy character construction on offer by Anderson are extremely outside of my wavelengths.",Bottle Rocket
28,oneguyrambling,"""You're complicated aren't you?"" ""I try not to be.""",8,8 June 2011,"This film is what Napoleon Dynamite must dream about as he polishes his glasses and irons his T shirt for the next day. Imagine being quirky, hip, exciting and fresh at one point, then a decade later still being all of those things – instead of the punchline to a million jokes and nothing more than fodder for the lamest and most dated of office jokers.Imagine that – Gosh.Bottle Rocket follows two friends (real life brothers) Dignan and Anthony through perhaps a few months of their life.Dignan is an over-zealous and under-equipped wannabe master thief.Anthony is open, honest and a little innocent (without being naïve), he just wants to please everyone and not cause any trouble.These two characters can co-exist, but Anthony's simple goals cannot be met when Dignan is around, as Dignan's desire to commit pointless crimes takes advantage of Anthony's need to please, meaning he is constantly doing things he doesn't want to do.As we learn early Dignan is patterning his next carefully planned 75 years around teaming up with a gang of master-thieves lead by Mr Henry, who Dignan had the good fortune to work with for a short time while Anthony was in a voluntary mental health clinic. Along with Bob, a guy who just wants to be involved Dignan and Anthony pull an early heist, using unnecessary tactics and pointless and ineffective methods. Thankfully for them their small time crime is somewhat below the radar, though they still go on the lam and hide out until the ""coast is clear"", and really this is where the movie gains steam.+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ While on the run, at least in their minds the team stay in a cheap motel. Bob and Anthony are basically relaxing and Dignan is plotting the next big move, acting like they just successfully pulled a heist on the Louvre instead of taking a couple hundred bucks from a closed bookstore.Anthony meets a young oddly-pretty maid named Inez, who doesn't speak English. They hit it off, or at least Anthony thinks so, there is quite a communication issue that Anthony seems content to ignore.When Bob has some home issues and scarpers in the middle of the night, taking his car and leaving the other two stranded Dignan is furious at the perceived betrayal. When reasoning fails Dignan and Anthony have a falling out and go separate ways.Of course the gang meets back up, meets Mr Henry at last and has more adventures, or at least one more.+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ But this is not a heist flick, or a crime flick, and definitely not a drama or thriller – in fact it is really not about much of anything. Like the best and worst of director Wes Anderson Bottle Rocket seems to indulge in just watching the characters as they deal with situations that range from extremely mundane to mildly involving. There are no big explosions in these films, no especially witty dialogue, no Tarantino-esque long stories and speeches and no big getaways or 43 killed in a hail of bullets action sequences.You either smile and chuckle as you watch the film and let yourself get involved in the story or you will be bored as hell, there isn't too much middle ground.To sum up Wes Anderson's work with one quote I always think of this brief exchange between Anthony and a random girl in Bottle Rocket: Girl – ""You're complicated aren't you?"" Anthony – ""I try not to be."" By not complicating matters and allowing the story to just ""be"" Wes Anderson may never get huge box-office business, but when it ""works"" his films are effortlessly charming and worthwhile. Bottle Rocket might just be the best example of that.Final Rating – 8 / 10. Wes Anderson may never make a truly great movie, but if he made more like Bottle Rocket that isn't a bad outcome at all.",Bottle Rocket

30,sharky_55,"Don't call me idiot, punk.",7,5 February 2016,"What I expected from Wes Anderson's debut feature, having seen all of his other work and become a fan of his over the years, was something a bit less methodical and more fresh. The first thing that people think about when they see his name is of course his distinct style. This is something that is noticeable to even the casual moviegoer, even if they don't have the vocabulary to exactly describe or express it. And you see little hints of it here in Bottle Rocket. The hard angles of the frame looking down at objects being laid out for our characters to survey creeps up when Dignan outlines his 75 year plan to Anthony - perhaps not as rigidly as later Anderson. The characters are assigned snappy dialogue that is delivered with an air of nonchalance, particularly in situations of danger and risk. The motel, with its chic pink and white decor, is positively dollhouse-esque. And there are little details that would only later show up; here he is more likely to conventionally cut between subjects rather than use his trademark whip pan like a character turning his head. The biggest different, apart from this being his debut and still finding his stylistic feet, is the budget. Anderson's later features would later all have distinct colour palettes that bloomed in flat layers behind our morose main characters - as a sort of dramatic irony in their emotional distress that fails to recognise the beauty in the world around them. And he would have the financial freedom to dedicate huge amounts of detail into his production design for lavish scenes that might only last a few minutes; see the intro for The Royal Tenenbaums. To his credit, Anderson gets more than his money's worth in Bottle Rocket. The aforementioned motel looks like something out a faded postcard, still and pale in its serenity. Yeoman's strong yellows and reds punctuate each scene and seem to represent comfort in Dignan and Anthony's respective dress. Ultimately, the story of Bottle Rocket is a littler underdeveloped. Anderson twists the usual small-time crooks into these vivid storybook characters and fills them with his own brand of awkward humour. They plan an elaborate escape from the mental hospital, only to realise that anyone can walk in and out. They methodically canvas an empty house only to have revealed that it is Anthony's family house and that they have a specific list of approved and forbidden items in mind. A life of crime is more an inconvenience to them rather than a career path, and they are easily sidetracked. The plot moves quickly towards an end that is a logical failure. It doesn't seem to be too much of a concern because they are not vicious criminals but misunderstood grown up boys who have not yet found their calling in life. There's a sweet romance that blossoms as expected. The brothers quarrel and make up. They are scolded by the same people they rob, and take care to adjust the figurine display while they steal. While normal characters would be left speechless at their mentor robbing them blind, they shake their heads and chuckle. And there are those supercharged moments when one- liners are spit out and the soundtrack roars into recognition, but Anderson doesn't yet have that subtlety about his films. It's all about the Stones song. Nothing really seems to stick, and the lessons are vague and overly reliant on earnestness, as if this is enough to carry them throughout a lifetime. Their upbeat attitude won't be unseated. In the end, there's enough chemistry and natural charm to make it an enjoyable watch.",Bottle Rocket
31,fwomp,The Early Wes Anderson Is Still Good Wes Anderson,8,26 August 2007,"Wes Anderson is probably one of my favorite quirky directors. With films such as THE LIFE AQUATIC WITH STEVE ZISSOU, THE ROYAL TENENBAUMS, and RUSHMORE in his repertoire, I feel the ""quirky"" title to be appropriate. Best known for Rushmore (1998), Anderson's films have a unique edge to them. Definitely not in-your-face comedy, their impact is much dryer and subtler (I remember the nude gal in The Life Aquatic just being there because some nudity was needed. And I remember Bill Murray driving back and forth over his enemy's bicycle in Rushmore then placing it back in its bike rack and how I knew this would influence the battle yet-to-come).I'd never heard of BOTTLE ROCKET until somebody pointed it out to me. Having enjoyed Rushmore tremendously, it came highly recommended. And after watching it, I can see why.This is early Anderson, and a film that helped launch his inimitable movie style. Released in 1996 and starring the newly found Wilson brothers (Luke and Owen), it goes to show that Anderson knew how to pick a good script and good actors to round out a chuckle-fest.Luke Wilson (MY SUPER EX-GIRLFRIEND) is no stranger to Anderson films now, having been given the lead role here and later strong supporting roles in The Royal Tenenbaums and Rushmore, Luke can celebrate his strong Anderson film trifecta and proudly point back to his roots in this film. Brother Owen (CARS) is one up on Luke in that he has performed in all of those, plus The Life Aquatic.Mental health issues abound for Anthony (Luke Wilson) and his buddy Dignan (Owen). In fact, Anthony has just been released from a voluntary psychiatric facility where he was resting after a nervous breakdown. Waiting for him in the bushes (literally) is Dignan, who believes Anthony is escaping from the psych ward instead via his own free will.The two quickly go back to their old ways. They decide to return to a life of petty thieving and even do dry-runs by ""robbing"" Anthony's family's home in order to see if they still have their robbing edge. They also decide to take on the strangest heists (from meat packing plants to bookstores). Since neither of them own a car, though, they have to get a driver and they pick Bob Mapplethorpe (Robert Musgrave) simply because ...well ...he has a car. Their first felony occurs at the aforementioned bookstore and they make quick their getaway, leaving town and scurrying across the state. They end up at a motel in the middle of nowheresville and decide to hold up. But the trio quickly turns sour when a pretty young hotel maid name Inez (Lumi Cavazos) catches Anthony's eye. Speaking no English, the Central American goddess fails to realize how messed up yet in love Anthony is with her (partly due to the language barrier and partly do to Anthony's fumbling ways).Word eventually comes to Bob (the driver) that a family member is in trouble and he has to return to town. Since he has the only car, Anthony and (more importantly) Dignan, flip out, telling him he can't leave. But he does and leaves Anthony and Dignan stranded at the hotel (which is fine with the love-struck Anthony). But Dignan wants to get out of there, so he devises a plan to steal a car and return to their lives of thievery. Not wanting to leave without his newfound love interest, Anthony tries to convince Inez to come with them. A misunderstanding ensues and he and Dignan are back on their debauched road. Eventually they take on a robbery at a meat packing plant and it goes horribly. Risking everything, eventually a choice has to be made about who stays behind  and takes the risk of capture  and who goes free.It is the strange and quirky (there's that word again) that drives this film. Owen Wilson's character (Dignan) is obviously an extreme case of an excessive-compulsive. He plans out items to the nth degree, ensuring that everything is okay decades later. Anthony (Luke) struggles to regain some sense of normalcy in his life but keeps getting dragged back down by his bond with Dignan while being tugged the other direction by Inez.In the end, all turns out bizarrely well. Dignan ends up where he belongs, Owen gets what he needs, and even Inez finds what she's looking for.Certainly one of the less known Anderson films, this one still comes highly recommended, just not as highly as his more recent works.",Bottle Rocket

33,AhmedSpielberg99,"A zestful, if uneven, debut!",7,27 April 2021,"In all honesty, the plot is awfully muddled I couldn't even figure out what it is about, and it keeps going off at a tangent frequently with all its twists and turns until it becomes almost entirely obfuscated by the end. But seeing whip pans, dolly-tracking shots, overheads of perfectly placed props and profile shots among others that would later become Wes Anderson's visual trademarks is oddly satisfying and special in its own way. Sure they seem half-ripe and lacking in the tantalizing aesthetic quality that define the look of Anderson's films, but they are all there and as effectively and perfectly employed as in the auteur's most acclaimed efforts. And the same can be said about the hodgepodge of evocative music choices. Madcap and slapstick moments are present as well. What truly piqued my attention, and gripped me throughout the hour-and-half runtime, are the warmth of friendship between the lead duo (played by Luke and Owen Wilson) and spirit of camaraderie between the three pals that, alongside the plotline revolving around Anthony's romance with a hotel chambermaid, give the movie a feel that's at once tender, free-wheeling and delightfully charming tending to make one think of John Hughes. Whilst the attempts at making a caper story with a light-hearted approach are worthy of appreciation, I think it's fair to say that it is the weakest link here. Still, Bottle Rocket is a small-scale joyride and a confident debut for one of the most idiosyncratic filmmakers working today.",Bottle Rocket
34,johnnymonsarrat,Jon Monsarrat review: more drama farce than comedy,5,5 April 2002,"""Bottle Rocket"" reminded me of the films ""Rushmore"" and ""The Royal Tenenbaums"", because the actors play it serious, and there's no cartoony quality that hints that no one's really going to get hurt. It's tough for me to laugh when someone's emoting real pain rather than cartoony pain. Also, the film is slow-paced and has many sentimental scenes, and it's hard for me to get sentimental when the protagonists are total losers.However, ""Bottle Rocket"" is definitely a comedy, and there are some hilarious moments. I once read Chuck Jones' autobiography (the guy who created Bugs Bunny) and he said that comedy is when the film is about a straight man getting mixed up with a weirdo. Farce is when the film is about the weirdo. He didn't say why, but for some reason comedy works and farce doesn't. ""Pee Wee's Big Adventure"" is a good example of a farce, as is ""Mr. Bean"". ""A Fish Called Wanda"" was a comedy (the straight man was the John Cleese character).So I guess ""Bottle Rocket"" was a little too farce for me. I couldn't identify with the protagonists and therefore wasn't that interested in the drama bits.Who should see this film:-- Drama film buffs who like comedies. (But I'm not sureif you'd find this film arty or just off-key.)-- Comedy moviegoers who aren't expecting Generic Hollywoodor Fast Paced Zany Comedy, and that's OK with them.I'll give ""Bottle Rocket"" a 5 out of 10.",Bottle Rocket

This film has a different perspective than the above mentioned clichéd trivial thinking.It has got all the ingredients of a good fun film. There is a love story, a friendship, envy and even deceit. It's the flow of the story that makes it a good film and a cut above the rest. The performances are strong and believable, the editing is precise and the cinematography is good. Keeping in mind the meager budget, this is surely a well made film with good production quality. The winner although is the story and the writing.

37,avik-basu1889,Anderson's debut !!!,6,7 November 2017,"'Bottle Rocket' was Wes Anderson's first feature film and one can clearly see the rough, unpolished edges in this film which is somewhat expected from a first-time filmmaker. Although one can understand that the characters in the film are a bunch of individuals who are constantly plagued by a nagging feeling of inadequacy and insecurity. They are a bunch of suburban man-children who at the back of their minds are conscious of their immaturity, but at the same time, they are also reluctant to consciously make an effort to trigger any sort of growth in a mature way. Instead they think of silly and potentially self-destructive ways to find entertainment and meaning in their lives. But the problem is, the Anderson's treatment of these characters never really go beyond a broad, superficial level. The film doesn't explore or give enough information about their past to backup their character motivations in the film. Their is a romance sub-plot added involving Luke Wilson's character Anthony and a housekeeper of the motel that Anthony, Dignan and Bob were staying in, and unfortunately it feels really rushed and the romance never really goes anywhere.Anderson's style of storytelling wasn't yet as quirky and unique in 'Bottle Rocket' as it became later on. Yes there are elements like the use of slow motion, the use of music and certain visual idiosyncrasies that connects it with the subsequent films in Anderson's body of work. But for the most part, the direction and storytelling in 'Bottle Rocket' remains somewhat conventional.However, have said all that, the film still wasn't a disappointment. This is because the presence of truly witty and enjoyable humour, to some extent makes up for the lack of character depth. The subversive set-pieces, the understated dryly funny dialogue and the comic timing in the acting performances really made the film entertaining.I don't think the film is deep enough for viewers looking for a very dense, layered character piece. But just on a superficial level, there is quite a bit of fun that can be had with it due to the inherent comedy in it. Recommended.",Bottle Rocket

40,noahgibbobaker,Charming goodness.,7,23 March 2021,"I'm kind of surprised this bombed so hard in cinemas, It's a really cute easy ride with a charmingly low budget, the short did quite well at sundance too which makes the bomb even more surprising to me, and it was on that Scorsese list, ""Bottle Rocket"" had a lot going for it dude. Having an R rating in the US definitely didn't help it succeed, I reckon this kind of thing appeals to an early and mid teens demographic more than the older audience that Anderson and the Wilson's obviously made it for. I totally would have loved this during my early or mid teens, probably more than I do now.I loved seeing an early stage of Wes Anderson's visual style, same goes for his writing style although that's far more similar to what we know and love about his dialogue and storytelling now. This has everything a current day Wes Anderson movie in a more barebones developmental way.The actors gave good performances and had great chemistry. I'm not the biggest fan of Owen Wilson in this but it's mainly down to his character annoying me to a point where it hinders my experience, he's not annoying in the quirky awkward innocent way he's meant to be, to me anyway. The romance subplot works well, it added another layer which is necessary here.Musically ""Bottle Rocket"" is cute, there's a cute baseline that plays as a kind of Inez leitmotif which I love to see. All the music sets the tone well and doesn't draw attention to itself which if you're not focusing on it like I like to, this is exactly what I think the intention of the score is.None of the emotional moments really worked for me, I didn't feel anything during the sadder scenes in particular, I spose I just didn't care enough about the story and characters, I wasn't really very invested at all.

Then yeah, dignan has crazy ideas the whole time and there's bob that also has problems with family. the movie follows three guys with issues and feeling dettached from society to try making something big.i like wes anderson movies i can't tell otherwise: but i'm not a devote fan either. The movies i saw from him have a very distinct tone and humor - and i can't relate to that all the time. inhere i think we can already see some wes anderson future stuff: you already have the different colors throughout the scenes, the bright lights he usually uses for his films, some cuts, the dialogue that has a certain level of absurdity, into all collide in the final assault which is probably the most enjoyable part of this.while i can understand the context i found it harder to relate with the characters. the peculiar (didn't want to say weird, lol) people that usually hang around his films are not my type of archetypes. i see his films more as a work of craft or art that i can appreciate but find harder to totally relate with it. which is fine we can't identify ourselves to everything we see.still, bottle rocket while having flaws in terms of narrative structure and even some dialogues (i think the tone improved after) it's a nice film with more than it meets the eye and some funny things going on. i didn't love it, but i can understand why some people do. for me is a cool movie and a very important one being the beggining of the career of anderson - and if you like him or these type of comedy dramas with absurd in the middle - you probably gonna like this. i hope you do it's a good movie after all.",Bottle Rocket

Nothing is forced in terms of plot or actions by the characters. It is just the way things are happening to them which are shown happening very naturally. I have come across a number of comedy types and still I find this type involving silly characters who look normal, act natural and desperate to achieve something but somehow things never work for them. They never understand that also.The plot of the film revolves around three main characters, two of whom are just out from a mental hospital (but cured) and plan to attempt several robberies. The characters are natural, trying their best to do live life properly. Their plans are not hard core and neither is the difficulty too much. What the story focus is on their way of handling things which is way too amateurish and that's where the fun lies. This is one of the memorable roles for Owen Wilson and he without doubt steals the show.VERDICT: ""A recommended watch.""",Bottle Rocket
44,coop-16,A small gem of low-key comedy,9,17 April 1999,"Having seen ( and loved) Rushmore, I was determined to see Bottle Rocket. Fortunately, my university library had a wonderful laser-disc copy. This is a Beautiful film. The acting, the script, and the cinematography are near perfection. If you are looking for a series of loud guffaws and obvious jokes, this movie isn't the place for them. What it is the place for is subtle, rich, dry, low key humor. There are a few well timed side splitters, but most the jokes are of the smiling kind, NOT  the ""laugh out loud kind.This is a terrific movie, and it is one of the few times that the egregious Michael Medved has been right in the assessment of a film: it does herald a new, unique vision and sensibility.",Bottle Rocket

The 2nd character is aimless, follows out of loyalty and physically stalks a woman whose English isn't very good until he wears her down (not so romantic). The third character is so broken by years of physical and mental abuse he seems to accept the orders and abuse as accepted fact.While there were a few funny lines, the dialogue wasn't particularly interesting, sometimes it tried too hard to be clever and often it was hard to hear. Before you dismiss my review as just one of those people who rate their movie by # of explosions or just don't ""get it""... I do like Wes Anderson films. I like quirky/indie. I like subtle films where not a lot happens. This one just didn't work (for me).Worth watching if you're a Wes Anderson fan (and you want to see hist first film) or a fan of any of the actors.

Teaming up with college friends the Wilson brothers, Anderson delivers a sublime crime caper. It still ranks at the top of my favorites that this true auteur has blessed us with. Excellent direction, screenplay, cinematography, soundtrack and acting. The entire cast offer superlative performances. In particular Wilson, Wilson, Musgrave and Caan immerse themselves in their roles. The plot revolves around a trio of friends Anthony, Dignan and Bob. Anthony just did a stint at a mental hospital which is voluntary, yet Dignan feels the need to break him out of. The scene is uproarious. Dignan is an ambitious yet zany and quirky individual. Bob is pretty much the straight man with a lot of money and too much time on his hands. The three embark on a trip to pull off a heist sparked by Dignan's innate curiosity and love for adventure.Their target is Mr. Henry who is supposed to have a safe full of cash in his warehouse. The three hatch their plan with the help from an inept insider and immediately things go awry. The plot is clever, unique, whacky, insightful, heartwarming, riotous, loving and has a cathartic ending. There are so many memorable and fun filled scenes in this film.

Bottle Rockets is not his best film but it has some good moments. Throughout the film, there are very funny scenes and some good dialogue. I just thought that the film was missing Anderson's classic quirkiness and weirdness.The acting is very good. Owen and Luke Wilson work great together and both are very funny. Robert Musgrave, Ned Dowd, Andrew Wilson, and Jenni Tooley all perform well.The pacing, for me, was a little slow and the runtime was overlong. This film was better as a short rather than a full feature.Pros: Some funny moments in the story, Owen and Luke Wilson's performance, and good overall actingCons: Slow pacing, an overlong runtime, and the film was missing Anderson's weirdnessOverall Rating: 6.5",Bottle Rocket
50,deacon_blues-3,BEWARE! Idiots on the loose!,8,23 February 2012,"Wes Anderson and the Wilson triplets have made a classic idiot comedy! DIGNAN LIVES! What a riot! I just could not stop laughing through this thing! I think my favorite moment is when they are all in the middle of the cold storage facility heist when Kumar, the supposed safe-cracker, suddenly looks at Applejack and says to Dignan, ""Who dat man?"" We know we are in BIG trouble now, don't we? But this whole thing is a continuous mental institution on wheels from start to finish! The little love story between Anthony and Inez is very touching, and provides us some relief from the non-stop insanity (or does it?). Anthony's loyal friendship with Dignan is also heartwarming, if you can stop laughing long enough to feel it! I just never get tired of watching films about idiots doing outrageously stupid things!

Also, the soundtrack did not appeal to me, and it was over-played throughout the film.In light of today being the Marine Corps Birthday, I found this bit of IMDb trivia interesting, as well: ""After the movie bombed at the box office, Owen Wilson seriously considered joining the Marines, convinced that acting held no future for him."" He may have missed out on some good money, but he would have gained a whole set of awesome skills and a band of badass brothers & sisters.

The heist scenes are well paced and even if it doesn't have the full visuals that Wes Anderson has become known for you can still see hints of it in certain scenes, especially some shots of the exterior of the hotel. I loved the chemistry between the central three characters, especially at the start and the end was gripping but I felt that the middle was a bit slow with the relationship between Anthony (Luke Wilson) and Inez (Lumi Cavazos) at times feeling slow. On the whole though I loved this film and it was definitely a strong debut film for Wes Anderson and the Wilson brothers.",Bottle Rocket
53,SimonD1900,Among one of the most human movies I've seen.,10,23 June 2020,"This was Wes Anderssons directors debut. And you can really already recognize his artistic style, even if much smaller budget then his later films. This film also has this very family like tone, that I think comes from that almost everybody involved are real good friends, doing this together, trying to make their first movie, and also that the two leads are actual real brothers playing brothers.The film is about a bunch of guys that thinks that the life of crime is the way to go. But they're very far from any tough hard boild gangsters. They're thieves sure, but they kind of give you the sense they actually couldn't hurt a fly. It's a comedy but also with this sad tone, that I actually think is Wes Anderssons trade mark by now. And it's a really nice thing, something rare you don't see from any other movies, not in the same way at least. It gives you this really warm feeling. To me, what this movie is saying, is that we all try to be something we're not sometimes, we all have issues, we're all failures on some level and we all have insecurities, but... that's okey!The movie is also very funny. And well paced, even if perhaps a bit slow, I think it works well here. Some nice songs are included in the soundtrack also. And Owen and Luke plays their roles perfectly. Luke really seem depressed, it's actually a really good portrait of a chronically depressed person. Owen does the thing he does also beautifully, being this really optimistic enthusiastic guy but that's actually kind of sad and lonely inside, just brilliant peformens.I adore this little movie. So nice.Martin Scorsese actually said this is one of his favorite movies, that he watch multiple times. Kind of fun fact.",Bottle Rocket

What can we say, are we missing something? apart from a couple of genuine moments, like the foiled robbery & James Caan's excellent parody performance we were left wondering how can this film score so high?

57,IRateFilms,"Bottle Rocket, good launch pad for ANDERSON.",6,24 September 2006,"The first and weakest of Wes Anderson's films, Bottle Rocket, is by no means a weak film. Co-written by then credited Owen C. Wilson, the screenplay is very intelligent and shows how the screen writing duo (Wes Anderson and Owen Wilson) has evolved. Starring the Wilson brothers, Owen and Luke Wilson, this small-budget comedy has what most large budget comedies lack, a perfect mix of drama and comedy. The film, about two friends that both were patients at a mental ward, portrays how innocent fun can sometimes hurt people. Rocket never becomes over-dramatic or slapstick in its comedy. It is clear that Anderson was experimenting with his style, and would not perfect it until his next film, Rushmore. The characters are clearly dysfunctional and like to take unnecessary risks at their own expense to make the script move along. This is not a fault in the script, but a blessing as this keeps the comedy and serious moments perfectly balanced. The cinematography is sometimes amateur with its unnecessary close-ups and wide angle panning. The soundtrack, done by Mark Mothersbaugh is excellent and just proves why he has worked an all of the subsequent films with Anderson. It seems Anderson and Wilson have an enormous talent when writing dialog for unusual, anomalous characters. This film is a testament to the fact that a good script, and a working knowledge of film work can create an original and enjoyable film.",Bottle Rocket
58,coldstick,Don't go out of your way to see it,6,17 August 2005,"Bottle Rocket started off strong, with some big laughs, believable character interaction and amusing ""heists"" but seemed to lose its energy around the middle, with slow spots popping up everywhere. By the end of it, I wasn't horribly satisfied, but I didn't regret watching it. Owen Wilson plays a different, more angry / pathetic character than in most of his other movies, and his attempts with Luke Wilson to be ""criminals"" were a blast to watch. But somewhere along the line, it just became less interesting, with an unnecessary ""bully"" character who added little to the story, and a love story that got kind of annoying. Overall, it's not a terrible movie, but I wouldn't advise you to go out of your way to see it.",Bottle Rocket

60,charlietuna,Its Wes...,6,28 March 2001,"I have to be fair.  Wes Anderson has a fresh style.  Both ""Bottle Rocket"" and ""Rushmore"" are entertaining, smart films.  But the bottom line is the characters in his films bore me.  I sit there, impressed with his direction and writing (with Owen Wilson), yet I sit there waiting for the movie to end.  It is easy for me to get up and get a sandwich in middle of either of his films.  Perhaps it is analogous to walking around the Uffizi. Are you taken by Hans Memling or Antonio Allegri? Or does 16th century religious iconography bore you to tears?  Basically my boredom is not Anderson's fault.  ""Bottle Rocket"" and ""Rushmore"" have many memorable scenes and some fantastic dialogue but ""Repo Man"" entertained me more than either of them. Sad isn't it...I blame society.",Bottle Rocket
61,lampic,Unforgettable,8,24 July 2015,"Because I enjoyed ""The Grand Budapest Hotel"" so much, I decided to go back to Wes Anderson and check him out some more. So I went all the way back to his first directorial debut (not counting something short done before) and was pleasantly surprised. Just as I expected, back than at the age of 26 he didn't have all the financial background he can command today and yes, it does look like it was done on a shoe-string budget but at the same time it bursts with youthful energy, enthusiasm and absolutely endearing earnestness. Basically ignored by industry back than, ""Bottle Rocket"" was made by bunch of friends and it is about bunch of friends, sweet gentle losers who decide to turn to life of crime and adventure (they have plan for the next 75 years). The problem is, they are not really so dangerous or brutal, these are just three naive guys who can hardly have a conversation without getting into arguments and fights with each other. Luke Wilson and Robert Musgrave just tag along behind wonderful Owen Wilson who is heart of the movie, he is so darn crazy and sweet and annoying simultaneously that you are not sure do you want to hug him or hit him over the head. Almost everything they planned (and much more than they expected) goes terribly wrong and you can't help but to love them seriously for all their confused efforts and sincere love between them. Its not funny in a roaring way, but it touches you really deep because they are basically three outsiders with their own problems who understand and support each other. At the end of the movie I surprised myself being genuinely touched and even teared up a bit. More I think about it, more I am convinced its one of those sweet, unforgettable little movies that nobody has ever heard of. Martin Scorsese paid attention.",Bottle Rocket
62,obiwan2005,I normally hate Owen Wilson...,10,17 January 2004,"In anything. But man was he great in this movie. I mean it was such a good performance. This movie is director Wes Anderson's (Rushmore, The Royal Tenenbaums, The Life Aquatic) feature directorial debut. It's about a group of misfit friends that decide to take up a life of crime. The group includes Anthony (Luke Wilson) just got out of the nut house and is searching for himself. Dignan (Owen Wilson, co-wrote the movie with Anderson) is the confident but bumbling ringleader who wants to be notorious but doesn't know how to execute a plan to save his life. And Bob (Robert Musgrave) the driver/look out who just wants a little recognition. The movie follows their misadventures of them robbing a bookstore, going on the lamb, Anthony falling in love with a Motel maid who instills joy back in his life, and Dignan's 'big score' that involves his former employer. The subtle humor and deliveries by the actors make the movie stand out in it's own little version comedy. The characters are losers, but lovable. You can't help but cheer them on even though what they do is illegal. I highly recommend this cool little film. It's an excellent introduction into the wonderful films of Wes Anderson.RATING: **** out of ****",Bottle Rocket
63,FloodClearwater,Wes Anderson's Early Meanders,6,20 August 2015,"Bottle Rocket is a mid-1990s indie film about a few quirky, mostly directionless 20 year old men who end up in a caper involving residential lawn care.This was the first film made by the assuredly brilliant, eminently (by now) accomplished Wes Anderson. Viewers expecting the same bottled madcap magic Anderson would later deliver in Rushmore, The Royal Tennenbaums, and The Life Aquatic [ . . .] will not find much here.Anderson critics building their cases against disappointments like The Darjeeling Limited will find in this film the seeds of the auteur's excesses sometimes getting the better of his projects. Combining the talents of Owen Wilson and James Caan with some (much) lesser lights, the film is amply kitted out with dynamic actors. But those actors are not given much of a story to tell. Rather, the film unfolds almost as if Anderson was out to prove he could make a film that doesn't try to do storytelling. And for the record, is this a comedy we are watching, or a Somerset Maugham homage, an existential commentary we should wanly smile at and droll along with?",Bottle Rocket

I never laughed....not once.Basically Luke Wilson is a mental patient who gets out and joins 2 buddies for a crime spree. They steal stuff and travel around.

65,Nothinggrandproductions,A fairly uninteresting film with occasional peak moments of interest,5,30 September 2013,"Wes Anderson tends to be hit or miss for me. I love Moonrise Kingdom and Fantastic Mr. Fox, they both had a unique style, great performances, and well-written stories. Other times, I won't like his films such as The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou where the humor didn't work for me and most of the film lacked much of an actual plot. Nearly the same goes for Bottle Rocket, his first film. Digan (Owen Wilson) rescues (but not really, he was getting out anyway) Anthony (Luke Wilson) from a psychiatric unit and Digan shows his plan of being involved in heists and building an entire life plan from there. The entire movie doesn't actually have much of a plot. In fact, it reminded me of a movie like Slacker directed by Richard Linklater, except unlike Slacker, this movie involved all of the same characters being involved in conversations about a whole lot of nothing where as Slacker involved multiple people in random conversations.Owen and Luke Wilson definitely play there roles with some charisma and are fairly entertaining but the writing itselfis just kind of boring. The humor was lacking. I laughed here and there but it wasn't very often. And besides that, the plot is still so unbelievably empty. Barely anything happens up until the last 10 minutes which are arguably the most entertaining part of the film. The enjoyment of this film really depends on if you like the dialogue. For me, it kept me uninterested most of the time except the occasional peak moments of humor and the charisma from the actors. Spiced throughout the film, you notice Anderson's beginnings of his style from his music choices, some of his camera choices, amongst other things which was nice to see as a fan of some of his movies. Overall, I'd consider this a film a bit of a disappoint but I can't say I full-on hated it, it was an oddly relaxing film to watch, maybe due to its simplicity even if it is much too simple.",Bottle Rocket

Definitely a good sign, although the scene of OwenWilson being lead off in handcuffs is almost exactly visuallyduplicated in 'Rushmore', so let's hope he isn't the kind offilmmaker to pillage his own corpus. In any event, not quite aspolished as Rushmore but still well worth the investment of anhour and a half.Owen Wilson is much better off playing the geeky wannabes thanthe would be hunks. I guess I should go see ""I Spy"" (but Bill Cosbymight not forgive me).I kept waiting for the joke to gel about the character named ""BobMapplethorpe"" (same name as the late, controversial photographer) but it never came...oh well.",Bottle Rocket
68,atliel,A rough sketch of what's to come from Wes Anderson,6,25 November 2007,"If there is one recurring theme in any Wes Anderson film it usually involves a look into the lives of grown men who have not done much in the ways of growing up. In Bottle Rocket three best friends, all grown men living in a middle class suburb, find meaning in their lives by being thieves. It's not clear why they want to steal but they never bother to go legit. What we have instead of a plot driven narrative is a character study about men who still think they're thirteen years old. Don't take this the wrong way, I enjoyed the film for the most part but it clearly is a directorial debut for Wes Anderson as the film structure is very rough. Within the film you can kind of make out his style that we know he will ultimately improve in his other films but what I find interesting is that theme I mentioned.In Rushmore, although the protagonist is in High School, it's easy to see the immaturity of the adults that surround him (and what will become of him in adulthood?). In The Royal Tannenbaum's the adults of the family are dysfunctional because of the way they were raised so the character's have to come up with what they ""believe"" how grown ups are supposed to act. In The Darjeeling Limited the main characters act very much like they most likely did as children, with one character upset at the responsibilities of becoming a father.I remember when MTV had done a quick featurette on this film, shortly before it was released, it contained a quick interview with the Owen brothers detailing Cahn's dismay with not being able to get an answer as to why the film was called ""Bottle Rocket"". The brothers got a kick out of it and it's no surprise that their sense humor in the interview is very much like the one displayed in the movie. Regardless, the film had piqued my interest but for whatever reason I didn't see it. Since then I have seen every Wes Anderson film, including The Darjeeling Limited and it wasn't until after seeing his last film that I decided to back-track and see this. In other words I did not witness his evolution as a film maker in any linear sense but now it's clear what he's been trying to do and say with his characters and I'm not sure I would have noticed it had I not seen his films in this order.Put it this way, because of his other films, I was able to appreciate Bottle Rocket and if you are a fan of his and have not seen it then you should do so as I think you'll like it. However, I'd be hard pressed to recommend this to someone who isn't familiar with his work.",Bottle Rocket
69,deadkerouac,Great film,8,24 November 1999,"""Bottle Rocket"" is the perfect film to watch if you're feeling alone or depressed, because the main characters are more than likely worse off than you are.

70,Foopy-2,Great portrayal of mediocrity,7,7 August 2000,"Sure, I enjoyed Rushmore better, but this was still a very enjoyable film for me.  I love Wes Anderson and Owen Wilson's focus on underachievers; it's very refreshing, honest, and sincere.  The people in this movie aren't glamorous movie stars with perfect bodies and sharp minds, but at the same time they're not depressingly unmotivated drug addicts either; they're utterly mediocre individuals and are very interesting because of it.  In particular, Owen Wilson's character is very interesting because, although he is a total underachiever, he thinks he is destined for great things--and rather than ridiculing him, like a conventional comedy may have done, the filmmakers have chosen instead to sympathize with him, or at least to portray him in an unbiased light.  In other words, he's depicted as a human being rather than a comic relief device.  All the characters in the film are very humorous, but they never feel like they're just ""funny factories"" that churn out one pre-fabricated joke after another without having any personality or emotional complexity.As with Rushmore, the soundtrack to this movie is awesome.If you like films with strong plots that really motivate the story, though, you might not like this.  I thought the movie was more of a character study or a ""road trip"" story than a film with a definite message or purpose.",Bottle Rocket

Bottle Rocket is a nice flick for anyone who is a big fan of good dialogue and satire. When watching this movie, I got the feeling that I was watching some sort of improvisation exercise at a drama class. While Luke Wilson gives a decent performance in the lead role, it's Owen Wilson who I was highly impressed with. His role as Dignun was a character who seemed to be missing some bricks in the building, but had an interesting form of intelligence that became appealing. While the movie is really enjoyable for a while, the satire starts to become too much. It's hard to not keep from having a strong desire to ask yourself why you're watching this movie. Like in most feel-good movies, it's hard to keep rooting for a character who continuously has bad luck. James Caan is an excellent addition to this movie and gives it a badly needed jump start 2/3 the way through, but by that time, you pretty much don't care about the movie anymore. I gave it a 6 out of 10.",Bottle Rocket

Quirkiness is not a substitute for comedy. This is nowhere near a Coen brothers film either. A movie about idiots that is supposed to be funny gets old very fast. Laurel and Hardy could do it. The Wilsons can't. Owen Wilson's shtick here was the same as in Shanghai Noon without the R*T = D algebra problem. This is a waste of time as a movie as everyone just ad-libs. It's is a stupid movie with a stupid plot with stupid dialog. It is no wonder that it earned almost nothing at the box office.",Bottle Rocket

76,Sickfrog,Fireworks,10,14 August 1998,"A brilliant comedy, and yet cleverly subdued. This portrait of small-time criminal is made masterful by the performances of Owen C. Wilson and Luke Wilson. Owen's Dignan dreams of glory as an outlaw are almost noble. He may have his inadequacies, but at least he is determined. While Luke's Anthony lacks that kind of determination, what he has is at least a sense of his inadequacies that Dignan lacks. But, while these two are never meant for great things, they can still achieve all their dreams if they just keep them small. Dignan is content with a life of small robberies. What he maintains is great pride for that. And Anthony find happiness in love from an unlikely woman. To find romance with the woman he does is much too quirky to have ever happened in a Hollywood movie. Yet this film plays it perfectly. And so, what makes this film so unique is that it is not so self -involved and moody like most independent films can be. And while it has a bright appeal, it is more eccentric than campy like most mainstream comedies can be. This is truly a unique comedy and I get the feeling that one day, the lines of hipness will be drawn between who has seen this movie and who hasn't.",Bottle Rocket

Bottle Rocket is very smart, very clever, and very fun Crime flick that turned actors Owen Wilson and Luke Wilson into Hollywood stars. Even though I've seen way better performances than this, it was still pretty good for a first time. I'm a big fan of Wes Anderson so I discovered this movie and watched it.The Story is about three friends in the Crime business. Dignan (Owen Wilson) is eccentric, quirky, and very obsessive in wanting to become a gangster. His friend Anthony (Luke Wilson) just got released from a mental hospital, but he dosen't really want to become a gangster, because he already got into trouble and had to go to a mental hospital to pay the price. But he joins because he's his friend. The third friend Bob (Robert Musgrave) is their getaway driver for their robberies. Both Anthony and Bob neither want to be a gangster, but they join Dignan because their still his friends, and friends need to stick together. The three go on crazy adventures together. Pretty much, the only problem I have with this film is, the acting isn't really that great, but what you'd expect for first time performances. Bottle Rocket is a charming story of friendship and following your dreams.",Bottle Rocket
78,smck,Soars,9,30 June 1999,"Quirky little road movies are a dime a dozen; this one works so well because the quirkiness is so freshly realized, the writing so sharp and inventive, and the actors mostly right on target. Brothers Owen and Luke Wilson are screen naturals and I was especially fond of the luminous Lumi Cavazos (bringing depth and intelligence to a fairly standard love interest role) and the sweet natured Donny Caicedo(bringing subtle humor and a big heart to another role that could have been a throwaway); actors who deserve to be seen again.",Bottle Rocket
79,spencer10,"Watchable, but should have been better",5,19 November 2007,"I think Anderson and the Wilson brothers have gifts for making good comedic farces. ""Bottle Rocket"" is not an awful or not even bad movie. But I was expecting more energy from these guys as I have seen them give it in their other movies. The other surprises that later turned into disappointments were one of it's executive producers is James L. Brooks who made and produced some unforgettable Hollywood box-office hits and gems such as ""Terms of Endearment"" ""Big"" and ""As good as it gets"". He is also an executive producer on ""The Simpsons"" which I love. The Wilson brothers are also very funny so my question is why didn't all these guys use all their energy they have shown in other movies and do it in this one. If they would have this film would have been brilliant. The other thing I don't like about it is it takes it's characters to different places and settings and never leaves them in a couple of places for more than five minutes. Examples are a drug store snack counter, a motel, a barber shop, a country club and all sort of other places. If it would have left it's characters in those places for more than five minutes this film would have been much better. To wrap it up: not bad but has so many low points that should have been made up for later on and they never did. For a better Owen Wilson film watch him in ""Meet the Parents"" rather than this.",Bottle Rocket
80,karma185,Ambitious,7,26 August 1999,"Everything about ""Bottle Rocket"" was ambitious.  The film making was ambitious, the characters were ambitious. While I can't say this was a religious experience, Bottle Rocket was a good independent film, and I do recommend it.  I was lucky it was on IFC, but I plan on renting it again just to catch the dialogue.  The way that the characters take their ""crimes"" so seriously is so fun to watch.  Everyone seemed to be playing pretend, almost.  When Dignan talks about his plans for a heist, you almost wonder when mom is going to call him in for supper.  I truly enjoyed the acting of everyone, especially the Wilsons.  I have a problem with the way Luke Wilson delivers his lines, he's effective and believable enough, but there is something in his speech patterns that annoys me.  Anyway, I also enjoyed the music in this film! Every song seemed to hit the right mood- especially when Anthony and Ines are together. I thought some parts dragged on a little but it was worth it to catch the themes in this movie- the difference between the ""reality"" of Futureman and his friends, and the ""reality"" of the gang. Some of  the best movie lines were in ""Bottle Rocket"". ""He said to me, 'Even though you are a F**k up, you're still my brother.' That touched me""  or when James Caan says (more or less) ""I hope you aren't offended when I say, your brother's a C**kSucker."" and then everyone in the room laughs.  I plan on telling all of my friends to see ""Bottle Rocket.""",Bottle Rocket
81,DFWcrtic,A great little film--with a slow middle.,8,4 July 1999,"Dallas filmmakers Owen Wilson and Wes Anderson have crafted a delightfully subtle comedy about small-time criminal wannabes. Unfortunately, the film suffers somewhat from a slow, obsolete, obviously-tacked-on romantic subplot that has no place in a film this hip and fresh. Although James Caan was the film's only name actor at the time of production [and it's one of his best movies in recent years], brothers Owen and Luke Wilson have since made names for themselves as actors as well. Rumors of swollen budgets and on-set tensions with infamous producers Kit Carson and Cynthia Hargrave aren't evident in the final product, which--overall--is a fabulous debut film for Anderson.",Bottle Rocket
82,BlackVelvet88,The simplest complex film I've ever watched,9,3 December 2006,"But that's a good thing. I actually had to record this to watch it because I wasn't ""available"" for TV at the time. Now, I'm happy that I did so. I love this film! I don't know why this tanked so badly at the box office. If you think about it as you watch it, it's very interesting. Of course, many people at the time had probably only heard the names of the actors in the film for the first time, with the exception of James Caan, so it may not have been a star attractor. Maybe that explains it? All I know is that I wanted to watch this again after the first view because it was that good.Dignan, played by Owen Wilson, is now a film icon for me. His name is not only the coolest name ever, but it alone spells out his dignity, passion, and aggressive will to hang on whatever he can get. Even though Anthony (Luke Wilson) makes a good main character, the film focuses on Dignan, for his actions motivate the other characters and keep the film going. Wilson's performance of this character was probably at his best and it is one of those very rare acts where the actor doesn't become the character, but actually is the character.As I said, it is the simplest complex films I've ever watched because the scenes are rather mellow and easy, not emotional and touching like most friendship comedy-drama films, but they still leave the audience with feelings. That's why the script is brilliant. It spares intensity from the screen and lets the audience find it for each person itself. It's very hard to achieve that, but Wes Anderson and Wilson do so.Each character is so well formed. Like Anderson's other movie, The Royal Tenenbaums, you can see the essence of each character just from their appearance, voice, and movement. Only for this one, I cannot quite describe how. The only way to know what I'm talking about is to actually see these characters for yourself.Almost like a Shakespearean play, every character shown plays a role. Even those who seem minor have an important part, so their appearances aren't wasted. An example is Grace (Shea Fowler), Anthony's caring but cynical kid sister who is deeply disappointed at her brother's chosen destination in life. At first, Anthony's happy to see her, to see that someone understands and knows him like the person he really is. But he sees that, over time, Grace has become unlike that, that her childish deceit has come in the way. She becomes a hard spot in Anthony's life and mind, which becomes resolved for a time by Inez (Lumi Cavalos).This may be a mere cult hit now, but I have a feeling that it will become something bigger in the future. It's become one of my favorite films and it has a special place in my mind. It's a landmark in comedy-drama and much more. Well done, Anderson.",Bottle Rocket
83,davidgkimberley,A new favourite for me,8,7 January 2012,"I find it really hard to explain to people why I think Wes Anderson movies are so great. There's an air about them that's so wonderful and I always feel really great after I've watched them. When I tried to explain my friend said, ""a bit like the Big Lebowski?"" and I think that's the closest you can come to describing Bottle Rocket and Wes Anderson movies as a whole they're that sort of brand of movie.Bottle Rocket is the story of three guys who live in the suburbs who are trying to become criminals and not making a very good job of it. The film starts with Anthony (Luke Wilson) coming out of a voluntary rehab type place and instantly joining his friend Dignan in his very poor attempts to become some sort of criminal. They are joined by their friend Bob, because he has a car, and start by robbing a library. The film really emerges from that moment and takes you on this up beat, weird (but wonderful) adventure.Owen and Luke Wilson are really good together, with Owen Wilson probably stealing the show as the completely useless but very endearing Dignan. Bob, played by Robert Musgrave, is also excellent in his role as the lovable loser. The soundtrack is perfect, everything comes and goes at exactly the right moment. This was probably one of the funniest films i've seen in a while too. If you like the Big Lebowski you will love this film (my favourite is probably ""Anthony wake up, Bob's stolen his car""). It also feels a lot longer than it is and whilst that's usually bad, in this case it was fantastic. At 30 minutes I looked to see how long I'd been watching it for and was amazed at how engrossed I was but also how much happens but yet the film manages to feel really slow and relaxed.Though I've said Dignan was endearing I guess the movie as a whole is endearing, its such a lovely film, I really don't see how you couldn't like it. Some how this just misses out on being a real classic on a level with Big Lebowski, maybe its because not as many people have seen it or something, either way its definitely in my top ten or top five or something. A must see, go and watch it!",Bottle Rocket
84,Monellifilms,Great first feature,8,15 December 2008,"Bottle Rocket is Wes Anderson's first feature, and a remake of a short film he made with Owen Wilson as well. It bears all of the hallmarks of a Wes Anderson film (quirky characters, dry humor, precise and orchestrated cinematography, and a story about finding something beautiful in the flaws of the main characters, especially Dignan (Owen Wilson).The film has a simple story, three friends attempting to commit a robbery and go on the run, but like Wes Anderson movies it is not straightforward. The movie is not about the heist, rather the relationships between the main characters and their flaws. The best of which is Owen Wilson's 75 year plan he created for himself and Luke Wilson's character, describing when they would get married, etc.Dignan's 75 year plan and his heist plan are themes Wes Anderson carries throughout his movies. A main character is always trying to accomplish something well beyond their means and capacity (i.e. Bill Murray in Life Aquatic, Max in Rushmore, Owen Wilson in Darjeeling). They are always planning and scheming something greater than they can obviously achieve. This movie blends humor, and drama very well. It reminds me of Fargo with its dry and occasionally dark humor. The film ends as a tragedy (the tragedy of Dignan), which makes us feel bad for him. But you almost feel like he will be okay. His personality makes this bad turn of fortune not seem so bad. Bottle Rocket is one of Anderson's better movies and if you enjoy any and all of his later flicks then check this one out.",Bottle Rocket
85,Chris Brown,overlooked but quite charming,8,8 April 2008,"This tale of three aspiring thieves has as much heart as any Wes Anderson film. As usual, Anderson presents flawed characters for whom you will feel compassion. But this comedy does not attempt to make you cry. Filled with dry humor, this script was the first of three to have been co-written by Owen Wilson and Wes Anderson. If you are in the camp that prefers Rushmore and Royal Tenenbaums, you will find that this script feels more like those films than Anderson's more recent work.Although this movie has a smaller budget than Anderson's other films, the director is able to put together a fun film. Anderson compiles one of his great soundtracks despite being unable to afford royalty-heavy songs.Perhaps not yet confident enough to take risks, Anderson does not engage in the visual experimentation found in his other films. Although you might miss the liberal use of vivid colors found in all other Anderson films, I think the fantastic sets and props (such as the submarine or the helicopter in Life Aquatic) are best left out of this simpler, more realistic film.",Bottle Rocket
86,samlane86,Bottle Rocket,8,5 January 2011,"Bottle Rocket is not only Wes Anderson's directorial debut, but also Luke and Owen Wilson's first feature film. I have to say, it is a pretty good start for all three men.It is a very entertaining film in and of itself, but Anderson fans should particularly enjoy seeing where he got his start. It's got many of the earmarks of the greatness that was to come: fantastic writing and dialogue, a number of very memorable character, and a well chosen soundtrack. As I mentioned earlier, this is also the first film Luke and Owen Wilson made and both manage quite good performances. Owen plays Dignan, a man trying to start up a heist team. He is equally enthusiastic and naive but seems to have good intentions. Luke plays Dignan's often reluctant partner in crime who is love stuck by the housekeeper at the motel they stay at. Luke has always been my favorite of the Wilson brothers, but I have to say Owen steals the show in Bottle Rocket. He has many great one liners that he delivers with impeccable comic timing. Two other actors worth noting are Andrew Wilson and James Caan. Andrew Wilson, who plays Future Man, is one of the lesser known Wilson brothers. I can't remember the story of how Anderson got an actor of James Caan's caliber to co-star in his debut film. Caan plays Mr. Henry the boss of ""the crew"" Dignan so desperately wants to be a part of throughout the film. It's a great, and often hilarious, character in the final act of the film.Also included on my copy of the movie is the fifteen minute short film, also titled Bottle Rocket, that Anderson and the Wilsons shot two years prior to the feature length film. Its is the same basic story and even contains many identical line and scenes, but it is still an interesting companion to the full length version.Check out my other reviews and whatnot at: notexactlyaquote.tumblr.com",Bottle Rocket
87,robbie-20,Low-key hilarity.,10,20 March 2003,"I love this movie.  It makes me smile and just feel good. 
It's about, primarily, a guy named Dignan, played by Owen Wilson, who has a 75 year plan of crime for himself and his friend, Anthony, played by Luke Wilson, and reaping the fruits of crime.  He wants to employ such interesting things as explosives, hot-air balloons, and pole-vaulting (!) in his outlandish plans for robbing bookstores and cold-storage facilities. He's happy to fill small baggies with money stolen from a bookstore after closing and takes pride in getting ""the best room in the house"" and some road-side Motel-6 type motel to reward themselves for a successful heist.If you like quirky, subtle humor, this one's for you.

Damn,10lines huh? Well OK, the quotes from this movie alone are enough to warrant a viewing. And don't worry if you don't like Owen Wilson, he's not over the top in this like he usually is.

92,yohonian,Very well done first effort for Wes Anderson!,7,25 January 2003,"After reading about this film about 500 times in magazines and on websites over the last few years I thought why not go grab it and give it a shot.  I mean Rushmore was very enjoyable and The Royal Tenenbaums was absolutely fantastic so why not?!With that said; why did I wait so long to see this film??  This movie is great.  I throughly enjoyed the writing of Anderson and Wilson (AGAIN!) and besides, who does this quirky subtle humor any better these days than Owen Wilson??  The film was as well acted as it was written and I must say for a first time effort from Wilson and Anderson I was very impressed. 
Now I must admit that this film was not in anyway the saviour of quirky comedy or worthy of an oscar nod but this movie is highly underrated.  I'm surprised more people haven't seen it considering that Owen & Luke Wilson have both gone on to become very well known hollywood actors!  I mean thousands will watch Luke Wilson in Blue Streak but I can't find 3 people who have seen him in this movie???  Trust me folks, if you find Rushmore or Tenenbaums remotely enjoyable than give this one a shot.  You'll be upset with yourself that you didn't try it out sooner. I AM!!",Bottle Rocket
93,lisa lionheart,a Wes Anderson fan disappointed,6,1 June 2002,"I have to say I was disappointed with this effort from Wes Anderson and Owen Wilson.  I have seen Rushmore and the Royal Tenenbaums, and I am a huge fan of both of these films.  However, Bottle Rocket doesn't seem to be at the same level of quality as these two later films.  All of Wes Anderson's hallmarks are there:  the theme of not fitting in, unusual and well chosen soundtrack, a veteran actor for a genial partriarch (James Caan for Bottle Rocket; Bill Murray for Rushmore; and Gene Hackman in the Royal Tenenbaums), and the Wilson brothers.  I'm also concerned there is a trend of female characters being less important in Wes Anderson films, and being relegated to the role of the exotic and unusual love interest.  This wasn't as apparent in the Royal Tenenbaums as it is in Bottle Rocket and Rushmore.It was hard to for me in this film to care about the characters, somehow, something was missing in them for me to really care.  All of the scenes that should have been funny just seemed empty and too contrived.  To give Bottle Rocket the benefit of the doubt, perhaps I do need to watch it again to fully appreciate it.",Bottle Rocket

Barrie penned it himself.Subtle, hilarious, intoxicating. This is the kind of movie you watch, and then are surprised that two hours passed by while you were completely enthralled. If you have a sense of humor that stretches beyond kick-in-the-crotch slapstick, you'll think it's one of the funniest movies you've ever seen. If you have any sort of imagination or education, you'll find this movie delightful in every way.Basically, this movie neatly symbolizes everything that went right with '90s film culture.

I was recommended to watch this film because I had a conversation about Wes Anderson with someone. I didn't know about his first film, Bottle Rocket, and my friend said she liked it because it was so laid back and appealed to her in some way.While I think it is a good first attempt for a film, and a good start for Wes Anderson. Although, I have to say that I got a good amount of the Wilson Brothers from the entire film, I thought it was admirable.It had it's moments and was shot decently well. There are a lot of problems with it. Motive for the story, the 2 dimensional characters with some important character traits, and a script that doesn't really work in the sense that it would serve to the story. This is long before Wes is making self aware quirky movies that pan to a certain type of trope or theme and it falls flat to deliver a solid movie with a plot that would make sense. It is incredibly well shot in a simple way and doesn't hit you over the head with anything, the performances feel a little forced, but it still all feels genuine enough to be believable.Once again, being that this is his first film, you can overlook a lot of the material and give him a pat on his back for what he was trying to accomplish. And he kind of hit it out of the park and began developing a style that some people would get under and truly respect. Anyway, that's my lightweight review of the movie.

You see, some of the humor is so subtle that you can easily miss it as I feel I may have. I caught enough of it however to know that Anderson and Wilson have put together quite a funny production.Owen Wilson is so damned funny in his portrayal of Dignan, a slightly off-kilter kid with bigger aspirations to a life of crime. James Caan is very good as well, in his small but essential part as the neighborhood crime ""boss"".This film never takes itself too seriously and that is why it is so good.

Anthony (Luke Wilson) has dropped out of college and his posh lifestyle to find himself and travel down the road to maturity with his chronic screw-up friends Dignan (Owen Wilson) and Bob (Robert Musgrave). Together, they pursue Dignan's lifelong dream- to become career criminals. Don't mistake this as one of those smartass, pop ironic, too cool for school post-Tarantino pieces of eternal film school dreck. Anderson and co. pull off something much more daring, a genuine, lived in film that shows a genuine affection for its characters. For all of its lightness, this is a major, multi-leveled achievment, one of the very best films of its year, surpassing even _Fargo_. And the final heist sequence is a bravura achievement, on the level of the fireworks scene in _Boogie Nights_.

I'm glad I rented it. It turned out to my one of my favorite movies. Bottle Rocket starts as Anthony Adams( Luke Wilson) is being released from an asylum for ""exhaustion"". Anthony meets up with his friends Dignan, an enthusiastic wannabe criminal( played by co-writer Owen Wilson), and rich, but depressed Bob Mapplethorpe( Robert Musgrave). Their first big robbery is at a bookstore, which is very funny because Dignan politely robs the store( ""Uh, do you have any bigger bags for atlasas and dictionaries, uh, sir?""). This leads to the three hiding out at a hotel where Anthony falls in love with a maid( Lumi Cavazos), who can't speak English. I'm not going to give away any more of the plot, because I feel I gave away too much already. Now I'm going to say why Bottle Rocket is a great film: It's original, funny( especially in the scenes involving Kumar Pallana as a senile safecracker), and with great performances by Owen Wilson, Luke Wilson, and another Wilson brother, Andrew, as Bob's bullying big brother. James Caan also gives a very good small performance.

At one point I was so sick of the movie just seemingly building up for something to happen in the plot that I was about to throw in the towel. If you do choose to watch I guess you can see if it happens about the same time. 42 min into this I had all of the ""build up"" I could take. But, I forced myself through it....hoping something great would come of it. I didn't. It is virtually plot less. Also, in Moonrise Kingdom some of the camera angles, panning, etc are...a bit edgy but really work well!

There is so much in this movie that repeat viewings are necessary just to get everything, like when Bob Mapelthorpe is talking to Anthony in the car, and drives right through a stop sign.  If you blink, you miss it, but Anthony's response is just so perfectly timed and the sound effects so well placed that it's a drop dead hilarious moment.  All of the actors give solid performances, especially Owen C. Wilson, who co-wrote the film along with the director.

It's a movie I can watch over and over again and still laugh like it's the first time. I agree with some that the overall ""fun-factor"" drops off a little during the romance portion in the middle, but I don't think James L. Brooks and the rest of the production staff would've given a bunch of first-timers that big of a shot without a little romance for those who aren't into the humor.I gotta tell ya, I love Kumar. From his role as the inept safecracker in this one, to Mr. Littlejeans (""Best play ever, man"") to Pagoda, he does it for me every time. And for all the Wes Anderson fanatics it's always fun to try and spot his old buddies in his movies (i.e. Dignan & Tenenbaum). For whatever reason, the Anderson/Wilson Bros humor does it for me. And what's best about it is that it never really seems to get old. They make their movies in such a way, that there really isn't a year or exact date or place that their movies take place in.

Even though Bottle Rocket is completely flawless, I still feel that 'The Royal Tennenbaums will always be my fav Wilson/ Anderson collaboration to date, but you never know do you?

107,Searchingforhelen,The Formula Works,10,26 May 2005,"I wouldn't even compare this film to WAs other films, if I didn't do the same thing, (being that I watch them over and over sequentially after seeing them initially). That is the problem with great suspense films or ""twist ending"" dramas, once you get the secret, there's no point reliving the moment.Wes Anderson has formulated a secret of knowing exactly when to have his characters move, speak, and live through his camera, that I could watch a thousand times. Bottle Rocket was an explosion of talent and ingenuity that lit the fuse with a wonderful script compilation by film newcomers, Wes and Owen. It's the little lines like ""you're the zero out in the car"" that just make you stop and review what you're watching. Bottle Rocket is like watching your least favorite aunt get slapped in the face with a fish. Right?",Bottle Rocket
108,write_the_wrong,stunning debut,10,16 November 2008,"1996's Bottle Rocket stands out as the arresting debut of director Wes Anderson, along with ongoing writing partner Owen Wilson. It immediately engages its audience in the ridiculous story of Dignan (Owen Wilson) and Anthony (Luke Wilson), two friends that aren't any good at being criminals - although they aspire to be. They work alongside their friend Bob Mapplethorpe (Robert Musgrave) or rather trick him into helping them due to the fact that he can finance their operations.What's so interesting about this film is the true heart that started in the script and then continued to shine through with the actors' performances. The characters were developed deeply enough for the audience to truly get a sense of who they were, what they wanted, and where they were going. Although the film tells the story of a group of wannabe thieves, it becomes clear that the reason why they are no good at pulling off these crimes is simply because of the fact that they are actually really nice guys, incapable of actually hurting anyone.The most remarkable aspect of the film would have to be in the brilliant performances featured throughout. Owen Wilson truly shines as Dignan, the group's leader - desperate to pull off at least one fantastic heist. He is hot-tempered, controlling, and he often lets his emotions get the best of him. Although he may screw up a lot, he is always quick to apologize. At the end of the film when he is sentenced to serve time, he claims to have no hard feelings showing a real growth in his character. Another standout performance came from Luke Wilson as Dignan's best friend Anthony. It's obvious that Anthony doesn't want to be a criminal, and that he simply participates because he doesn't want to make Dignan unhappy. After he falls in love with one of the maids at a motel they stay at, he realizes he can't work with Dignan anymore. Wilson's performance was outstanding - he was really able to convey both his character's indifferent side, and also being torn between love and friendship.Bottle Rocket was an outstanding debut achievement for director Wes Anderson, marking the beginning of a series of stunning films full of character driven scripts, great music, and aesthetically pleasing visuals.",Bottle Rocket
109,pharrott,Offensive to anyone of New World origin,1,14 September 2001,"Groucho Marx once said that that he wouldn't belong to a club that would accept him.  There are similar concepts concerning musicals and Robert Goulet.  I've discovered that if James Cann is in a recent film the same concept applies.  That is, James Cann's appearance is a desperate attempt by the producers to draw in viewers from my age bracket.This film is totally disjointed and has little redeeming features.  Perhaps other films with the Wilson crew are worth seeing but not this one.  The treatment of the service personnel who are hard working and the aggrandizement of the the rich mis-directed whites in this file is disgusting!",Bottle Rocket

It gets me right here man...(reference to the film).I think if you go into it thinking it will be like WEDDING CRASHERS or something like that you will be disappointed. It has very subtle and dry humor.Give it a chance as you may just love it. Pay attention, because the jokes are not in your face. This is a film that rewards you every time you see it.Ain't no trip to Cleveland...but a timeless and awesome film.",Bottle Rocket

As they try to make it a career they run into various distractions and incidents and find leading a life of crime much harder than it seems. Luke and, especially Owen Wilson are solid as the two crooks. James Caan also has a short but very funny role as a man the two and some others pull a job for. The script by Anderson and Owen Wilson contains some great dialogue. Recommended if you are a fan of offbeat comedies. 91 min. Rated R for some language.",Bottle Rocket
112,Rucker,Amazingly funny movie for lovers of idiosyncratic and subtle humor,10,17 June 2004,"I couldn't believe some of the bad reviews here. I just read a post which said ""most of the material just falls flat. The gags are also a bit lame, half of the time."" Wow....all I can say is that I have a totally different opinion!This is one of the funniest movies I have ever seen. I suggest you read some of the quotes from the ""memorable quotes"" section on IMDb and if they don't peak you're interest, stay away as you're probably among the bad reviewers here whom I guess have a more mainstream view of what is humorous.But if you like Rushmore and the Tannenbaums, there's a chance you might like this one even more.I also don't understand the reviewers who say the movie is not good because it doesn't ""have a point"" or the ""plot is not so great"" or ""not a good ending""....huh?????....did you people see and like Rushmore and Tannenbaums? These are subtle movies, if you want a nice ending go watch some more Hollywood dribble and don't pan movies that aren't your cup o' tea!",Bottle Rocket
113,ej-talbot,debut full of charm from the experts in subtle comedy,7,1 January 2005,"While ""Bottle Rocket"" is certainly best categorised as comedy this might mislead those expecting the typical composition of one-liners, facetious mocking and exaggerated situational comic of mainstream Hollywood productions.Instead the humour derives from the quirky, yet lovable characters, their perspective on life and approach in dealing with the challenges of society.The quiet matter-of-fact absurdity present throughout the film will evoke a constant smile rather than burst-out-laughter. This is typical of all Wilson/Anderson collaborations (Rushmore, The Royal Tenebaums) where strong characterisation enables the viewer to develop understanding and affection for the protagonists as the story slowly unravels. In ""Bottle Rocket"" this is supported by strong performances, especially that of Owen Wilson, who proves his actor potential in an atypical role.Though not flawless, (there is a lack of narrative urgency at times), this movie leaves the viewer ultimately entertained and charmed.",Bottle Rocket
114,nelsonc1991,Anderson fanatics only,5,7 February 2015,"This film only ranks a five based on the fact that it is Wes Anderson's first film. If he were to quit directing after this movie it would be at least a three. You can tell that Wes Anderson is clearly developing his style for cinematography and not for storytelling during this film. The entire premise of the movie is awkward and hard to watch since the Wilson brothers are frequently cast in more intelligent roles. Some scenes are boring, some scenes are confusing, but every once in a while you get a cheep laugh. I believe that Bob's condescending brother is the most humorous character in the film, besides maybe Mr.Henry, but they both play supporting roles. Acting from the main characters is dry, which is to be expected with any Wes Anderson flick. If you're a hip Wes Anderson fanatic, you would probably fall head over beard for this film. If not, do yourself a favor and check out Rushmore instead.",Bottle Rocket
115,nqpz,It's just boring,4,5 May 2008,"I don't like this movie. It's not really funny, and there's no big plot. When I watched it I felt like everything just happened without any big reason. The characters do have some kind of task in this movie, but it's nothing special. In fact I barely remember how this movie ends.The actors are great for their roles, but it doesn't help the story. It just keeps going on with no real target. I didn't laugh that much, and if it wasn't because I had a cold while I watched it, I probably wouldn't have watched it till the end.Maybe the problem is that the humor of this movie just wasn't me (I couldn't find much humor in it..- if any at all).",Bottle Rocket
116,speedster,"Filled with subtle jokes, great soundtrack, good heart",9,10 April 2021,"It may take more than one viewing to sync with the comedy vibe of this classic but it is well worth multiple viewings and only gets better. Dignan has the lion's share of one liners with many just stemming from his overly honest responses to rhetorical questions and his childlike innocence & enthusiasm. But the subtle comedy goes beyond that from the disgusted look of Grace's friend when she meets Anthony to the safe cracker sitting on the couch during the heist. And while I usually prefer a good musical score to set the tone of a movie I love the choice of tracks used which mesh perfectly with the scenes. A story of friendship and new found love is in mix as well. Give it a chance or two, you'll be rewarded.",Bottle Rocket

Will probably watch again soon.,Bottle Rocket
122,Luke-18,beginning of an era,10,6 February 1999,"For me, MTV has never been much of a cultural beacon.  So it was quite a surprise when, as I was flipping through the channels, I caught them presenting Wes Anderson with an award for best new director.  At this time, back in 1996, I was but a promising but aimless high school student with a vague notion of what I might do in college.  Sometime later I found ""Bottle Rocket"" in a video store and gave it a try.  What happened then can only be described as a religious experience.  That was the day I knew I would major in film.  Though this film may be too low profile to have any more than the most subtle of impacts on the industry, I think that future films by this Anderson/Wilson team will change the face of comedy.  The likes of the Farrelly brothers will find themselves in straight-to-video B-movie hell before long.  I guess you could call me an optimist.",Bottle Rocket

But in my opinion, the idea that it is simple is what makes it so complex. The humor that is used in this movie is some of the best I have ever seen in a movie.  Not since Fargo have a watched and literally laughed out loud at the uniqueness and occasional stupidity of the characters.  Bottle Rocket have everything ranging from the over anxious pre-thief Dignan too the child-like Bob Maplethorpe potential getaway driver.

You're always at lunch now!"" - ""Not always."" - ""Yes. Always!"") was what drew me to look for it on video. It is true that not everyone who sees it will like it, but to those few I say - give it time. Someday it will become very clear what is so perfect about a movie as great as this one.",Bottle Rocket

129,bubba_joe_louis,Bottle Rocket's fuse went out,2,30 June 2006,"Its a good thing writer Owen Wilson knew somebody in the business (Kit Carson) otherwise this hunk of junk would never have been made. Hundreds of scripts of this quality are submitted each month to Hollywood and are tossed promptly aside. They spent 8 million making this film, but it only made 1 million.The plot is sluggish, spending entirely too much time at the hotel where the boys, fresh off a botched robbery, are hiding out without a clue as to what to do next.SPOILER The movie has a good ""hook"" (three bored suburbanites try to become crooks) and the plot twist at the end is a decent idea (while running a job predestined to fail, the boss robs the boys blind), but the writing is pretty weak and the directing worse. ENDSPOILERI am actually glad Owen Wilson made it into the business as a comedic actor, but I can see why he hasn't written another film.I don't recommend this movie, unless you are really bored, are a big Wilson Brother's fan, and like to have a movie running while you clean the house.Bubba Joe Louis",Bottle Rocket

When I awoke, feeling sooo much better, I restarted the DVD and the smile didn't leave my face, even occasionally laughing hysterically; the scene where Dignan lets the smoke bomb off during the robbery is just mint. In fact that whole robbery sequence is priceless. Also great is the whole love interest thing between Anthony and Inez which comes across so naturally. Not sure why somebody compared this with El Mariachi by Robert Rodriguez, pretty much like comparing Casablanca with Pulp Fiction I'd have thought. If like this person, you tend to think far too much and over analyse everything instead of just kicking back and enjoying something unfold before you, then give it a miss, not to be recommended though as this film's a treat.",Bottle Rocket

I should find a *new* copy). Anyone I've ever shown this movie to loved it.James Caan gives his best performance since 'Misery', only this time it's funny.Watch for the scene where: Bob's driving, they just left Anthony's sister's school (when he returned his mom's earrings)...

Having enjoyed 'The Royal Tenenbaums' very much, I'd been itching to see this film for a long time. All I can say is that I was unimpressed with the film as a whole, but loved some of the lines within. The situation seemed overly absurd, and the characters' motivations were sketchy at best. There are some wonderful scenes and I laughed out loud a number of times, but I was also on the verge of turning the film off one or two times as well.

137,Heisenberg-G1,A very well written and different caper comedy that works on many levels.,10,3 August 2009,"Bottle Rocket is one of the most original and unique films that I have ever seen. With witty dialogue and great on screen performances, this film is a massive hit. With his first performance as actor on the big screen Owen Wilson also co-writes Bottle Rocket. The story is focused on three young aged friends in their life of crime, robbing houses and planning heists.These three men; Dignan, Anthony, and Bob are not bad guys. They are just a trio of men looking for something fun and exciting to do in their mostly boring lives. Having no jobs Dignan, Anthony, and Bob decide to pull of heists for fun. Let me get to introducing these characters, Dignan is a somewhat dumb yet riskless man who has nothing going on in his life and he is the so called mastermind behind the plans. Anthony is Dignan's best friend who was rescued from a mental hospital with the help of Dignan. Anthony put himself in the hospital for self-described exhaustion. This man is not crazy. The last of the trio is Bob. Bob is a very dumb and stupid idiot. Bob is the getaway driver in the heists called on upon by Dignan. There is not much to really know about Bob, pretty much only one word describes him.....idiot.After making a road trip buying a few guns these men plan their next heist, a local bookstore. They manage to steal a small sum from the store and succeed in getting away safely. They then decide to spend the night at a hotel on the side of the highway. At the hotel, Anthony spots maid Inez and the two fall into a romantic relationship although she cannot speak English very well. Before leaving the hotel, Anthony gives Dignan an envelope for Inez. Dignan delivers the envelope not knowing how much money is inside. She also unaware of this. Dignan steals a car but quickly breaks down in the middle of the highway. Anthony reveals that the envelope he gave to Inex contained the rest of the cash from the heist. Coming to the anger and disappointment of Dignan, the two go there separte ways from there. I will not reveal the rest of the story to anyone, not wanting to spoil it for anyone. That was just a brief summary on the film's simple yet brilliant and original storyline.Bottle Rocket being witty and funny at the same time marks Wes Anderson's film debut, which is a fascinating indicator of what is to come. Being a cult classic this film holds up to repeated viewings to please fans every time. Bottle Rocket also stars Luke Wilson, Robert Musgrave, Lumi Cavazos, and James Cann all giving good performances. But Owen Wilson is the one that shines in the cast giving a terrific debut performance, which also holds true for Wes. Bottle Rocket is a truly great, brilliant caper comedy that will likely hold its fame for as long as I can think.",Bottle Rocket

139,BottleRocket8,Wes Anderson's debut is a delight!,10,24 March 2005,"I don't have the words to express how much feeling I have for Bottle Rocket. Bottle Rocket is a movie that I'm sure is sentimental to a lot of people. Wes Anderson and Owen Wilson's superb writing style is first sampled in this debut film from the original director. Anderson crafts charming characters such as Dignan, Anthony Adams, Inez, etc. This movie may be considered light hearted yet it still touches real life emotions such as love, friendship, loyalty, and insanity. In the opening of Bottle Rocket we learn Anthony Adams is in a voluntary mental institution. This is where we first get a sense of the hilarity that is Dignan. Dignan devises a master plan to free Anthony from the mental home. It is in the first scene we learn Dignan does not have such a high mental capacity but is dedicated, caring, and loves to scheme things. Throughout the film we meet memorable characters along the way. Even James Caan as Mr. Henry. The movie is filled with jokes and quotable lines from Dignan, mainly. Also the love story within Bottle Rocket is one of the key factors that makes it so dear to me. Anthony falls for a cleaning maid at a hotel he and his cohorts hide at after a bookstore robbery. The end climax is brilliant. Dignan, Anthony, Bob, Mr. Henry, Applejack, and Kumar attempt to burglarize Hinckley Cold Storage. This is where we get the classic ""They'll never catch me because I'm f------ innocent"" I can't help but smile throughout this whole movie. It shows the dedication and desire to make a picture about someone's dreams. Wes shows his aptitude as a director in several ways such as in the acting, the flow of the movie, writing, techniques etc. Wes develops a lot of his trademarks here. Fueled by an awesome score by Mark Mothersbaugh and an unforgettable soundtrack with such musicians as The Rolling Stones, Love, and The Proclaimers.An unforgettable classic.",Bottle Rocket

From the mental home breakout, to the robbery at the end, it's just so perfectly done. It made me laugh all the way through, that doesn't happen with many movies to me. Wes Anderson is perhaps the best writer in Hollywood but saying that you cannot forget to mention Owen Wilson. The romance between the woman at the hotel and Luke Wilson is both touching and funny, giving the movie that type of hilarity and lovingness that every movie needs. It has a good blend of drama and comedy and the fact that James Caan robs that guys house is funny all its own. Applejack and Kumar are absolutely historical and Owen Wilson's character is probably my favorite character of all time in any movie (except for Mike from the Godfather).

The character of Dignan was too too great (Played by Owen). The situations were perfect, nothing overplayed, all believable. I loved this movie, it was better than the Royal Tenenbaums. Dignan interacting with just anyone was great. From his attempt to steal a car with an unaltered coat hanger to his first robbery interacting with the workers, pure genius. The other characters were good as well. Luke bringing the love interest into the movie and a mutual friend who is rich off his parents, its like they are all a bunch of mid twenties kids interacting.

Luke and owen Wilson and james caan are great in the film. but owen Wilson owns his character so much its quite incredible.if you've ever enjoyed another wes anderson movie or if you are a fan of subtle humor, or if you like off the wall movies about growing up and awkward romance, i very VERY highly recommend bottle rocket.",Bottle Rocket

It has witty humour throughout.The style of his camera-work is introduced in this film. We see Owen and Luke Wilson as friends who decide to take on a life of crime. Their choice is not relatable; yet, they are relatable because they seem very innocent about what they are doing. Outstanding writing and directing for a first full length film. It features a memorable role played by James Caan as the father figure/ hardened criminal. If you are a fan of Wes Anderson, WATCH this film. If you can, see the original short film ""Bottle Rocket"" as well. Don't expect the bigger sets, models of sets, clay-mation, or all of his frequent collaborators.

Wilson, who has since gone on to play shallow, surfer dude type characters in big budget action films) provides the central drive for the story, the heart of the movie lies in the character of Anthony, a man whose good nature, loyalty, and altruistic heart provides the thematic web on which the true force of the movie lies.  Truly a great picture.  I highly recommend one of my favorite movies of recent years.  Give it a chance; you won't be sorry.",Bottle Rocket
147,Prufrock-12,Brilliant Comedy,10,25 January 2000,This is probably one of the most brilliantly written comedies of the nineties. Wes Anderson and Owen Wilson are excellent writers. The Wilson brothers are all hilarious. This movie is a must for anyone who likes comedies. I also recommend the Wes Anderson movie Rushmore.,Bottle Rocket
148,beaner-6,Terrific Movie,10,28 December 2000,"Superb movie about friendship, loyalty, love, and trying to find your place in the world. The humor is very dry, witty, and subtle. Owen Wilson's Dignan is the funniest/quirkiest character in recent memory. The movie gets better and better with repeated viewings as you laugh out loud at things you didn't catch before. The characters are extremely realistic and it is amazing the way Anthony looks out for and is loyal to his fellow friends Dignan and Bob Maplethorpe. Highly recommended.",Bottle Rocket
149,jasonsad,Great movie,9,18 July 2019,I have like no complaints about this movie. The characters are written really well and it's shot really well and it's just funny.Like IMO that's all you need to know.,Bottle Rocket
150,movies-66,"Fun movie, endearing characters....",9,2 May 2001,"I was pleasantly surprised by this lighthearted crime story. The cast in this film really enchanted me to endear the characters and their dream chasing lives. This is a fun, well written comedy about two dreamers and a ""guy with the car"" who attempt to make their big break into organized crime. Rich characters and smart comic delivery make this a favorite of mine.",Bottle Rocket
151,blanchardumer,Funny,8,14 March 2021,This was on sale on iTunes and I love Wes Anderson's work. This was my first time watching this particular Wes film and even then this man was amazingly talented!I can already start to see his style shine through and his style of comedy. Seeing Baby Owen Wilson was a gem! Definitely a must watch if your into comedies about the underdogs who don't go anywhere in life lol.,Bottle Rocket
152,rshivs,Awful! Do yourself a favor and don't waste your time,1,31 December 2006,I wish there was a zero rating available for this movie. Never before has an IMDb rating let us down so badly! It was a total waste of the 40 minutes I forced myself to watch it before giving up. The movie can be summed up as an inane day in the mundane and mediocre life of a bunch of 20 something loser guys. Nothing much happens in the movie. You have to wonder if characters like these really exist in the real world. Pathetic and pitiful if they do. Argghhh! ... Sorry I'd even endure a slap stick comedy over this any day. I guess this is the archetypal example for not blindly trusting IMDb ratings. Avoid this movie.,Bottle Rocket
153,cowshow,"One minute it's running like a top, the next it's broken on the side of the road!",8,7 November 2001,"Bottle rocket is such a great great film. In a time where comedys are dumbing down to the lowest common digit just to keep the highschool jocks in the theater Bottle Rocket takes the high road, or dry road. The characters in this movie are people you run into everyday... Dignan the man with the plan but neither the intelligence or enough help from his friends to pull it off. This guy needs to be in a sequel. Every movie I see Owen in I still feel Dignan right below the surface. Luke as Anthony is perfect for the straight-arrow realistic man. The soundtrack is fantastic (pulling out an old classic from love scores many points) But overall the story of someone just trying to live out their dream whether it is being a rock star, or movie star, or in this case a robber... and not getting what they want out of it in the end... We've all been there and it's time to sit and laugh with some folks who have really been there.",Bottle Rocket

Can you see how incredible this is going to be... hangliding. Come on!You reading this review, and I'm sharing these ideas I won't back down from.

156,weeziethedog,One of my favorites ever,10,26 July 2009,"I think this is pretty much the perfect movie. Owen as Dignan is Oscar worthy. He was born for the part. I love when he throws out a subtle clue to his inner insecurities: ""I'm not always as confident as I look"", or ""What, is it weird being into exercise? Do I seem weird?"", and when he is just a goof, like yelling out in public places, ""Anthony, we gotta hide our identities!""Luke is great as the foil to Dignan, and a truly caring, innocent guy...oh, and the guy who plays Bob gets the ""spirit award"" (to quote Dignan).Futureman (the third Wilson brother) is the perfect psycho sadistic bully brother to Bob.James Caan is funny and scary. He's good at that role. Kinda like Dennis Hopper, but with a 'fro.And Ines is adorable. Most importantly, this movie is hilarious and has a heart. Share it with someone sometime.",Bottle Rocket
157,jeffery1005,Great movie,10,1 October 2002,"First movie i saw from this team and is definatly the best of the bunch. Dignan is the greatest character ive seen in a movie, the dialog is excelant. Please make a part 2!I didn't enjoy Royal Tenebaums, Rushmore was pretty good, the actor selection is outstanding in all of their films.",Bottle Rocket
158,uursw,"Laugh at the vignettes, search for the plot line",4,2 February 2003,"Introduction/CharactersI rented this film after enjoying Owen Wilson's comedy work in such films as Shanghai Noon and the Royal Tennenbaums. I was hoping to see a few sparks of what became his signature...interesting little bits of humorous, off-beat dialog. For that, I wasn't disappointed. As in SN, you can't help but like his character. Dignan despite the fact he is simply a petty thief. Through he little dialogs and mannerisms, he is almost able to convince you he doesn't mean to do others harm, but is really just seeking a place to be be recognized and to belong.Like his brother, Luke Wilson also shows a little bit of what would come to be his stereotypical role. He plays Anthony, the earnest and honest follower who would rather settle down and find love then get involved in illegal activities. In this role he manages to convince us he only gets involved out of a sense of loyalty, rather than to actually gain anything for himself.I was a bit let down by the Bob character, played by Robert Musgrave. He reminds me of a jelly fish, both in his character and in his acting: you see the vague outline of what he is trying to be, but in the end there is very little substance to hang on to. Bob apparently yearns for acceptance by his brother, but ends up looking like a man without a backbone.StoryThe loose plot revolves around the lives of three friends in their attempts to build lives for themselves. Anthony apparently is just looking for someone to love, Dignan is seeking a club to belong to and Bob desires a loving relationship with his brother. Together, they form a little ""gang"" with Dignan as the ring-leader.Overall, I was entertained by the various vignettes that make up the movie, but disappointed with the movie as a whole. The overall plot line, if you can call it that, does not really lace the movie together in a tight package. I felt like the conclusion was an afterthought rather than a planned event.ConclusionI can't really recommend this movie. It is awkward and uneven throughout and you come away almost wondering ""what was the point of this story?"".",Bottle Rocket
159,ed-guerra,Good but not THAT good.,6,17 August 2009,"I'm really big into subtle humor which is why I like Wes Anderson movies in the first place. But Bottle Rocket doesn't have subtle humor. It has attempts at humor. That's where I find everyone just saying the same dribble about this movie that they say about his others. ""Oh it just has limited appeal"" or ""you just have to get it."" No. It's just not funny. Yes you will chuckle at parts, but that's about it. It's almost too obvious that this script was watered down or padded some to make it a feature length. If anything is worth seeing, it would be the original short. Unless you're one of those ""claims to understand every indie film"" types of people, this probably isn't the right flick for you. Any one of his later works will be a better choice.",Bottle Rocket
160,srmoondog007,"Humor, innovation, adventure and originality",9,31 May 2006,"The teaming of the talented Wilson brothers and the illustrious Wes Anderson was a new idea in the mid-nineties, borne out of youthful exuberance, fresh ideas, and long-standing camaraderie. Bottle Rocket was essentially an independent experiment with such subtle humor that it is not received well by all audiences. The brilliance of this picture lies in its undertones, and that does not sit well for people who want immediacy, scatological humor, and famous actors. Sure, they were able to secure James Caan as the ridiculous, kung fu fighting crime boss, but Owen and Luke were unknown, and almost unrecognizable to their current Hollywood characters. This movie is so funny I bought it twice, after I loaned it to a friend who never returned the DVD. It is replete with layers of comedy, unforgettable quotes, and Anderson's signature direction, before it was replicated and mimicked by followers. Admittedly, this film is not technically as superior as the Royal Tenenbaums or maybe even Rushmore. However, it is the bare bones production that make the comedic performances in this film so apparently superior.If you see this film once and don't catch what everyone is talking about, watch it one or two more times and listen carefully. The next time, you may hear Dignan say, ""Okay. There, you see the star is me, right there, and I'll be in there. The X is Anthony. Bob, you're the zero out here in the car.""",Bottle Rocket
161,radnip155,hysterical,10,13 February 2003,Perfectly filmed and written.  Good scripts go a long way.  Owen wilson and wes anderson start a good thing with this debut.

162,joshua-bort,Watch this or you're a darn fool,10,6 August 2014,"Futureman is an angry older brother. Why does he harbor so much hate against Bob? Because he's the only one with a car. What the eff is this? It's a review. Bob has nothing to prove. He's willing to be a getaway driver, but don't ask him to cut his hair. Or Anthony. On the run from Johnny Law ain't no trip to Cleveland. The bandages on their noses during the robbery are the perfect distraction. Bring a bigger bag next time. This was just a practice. A warm up for the big league with Mr. Henry, a karate black belt trained by grand master Rowboat. Don't mess with them or you'll get water dumped on your head.

164,stringcheeseninja,Connections to The Catcher in the Rye,10,26 March 2004,"First of all, let me say this is my favorite movie. But what made it even better was the connections i noticed between this film and the novel ""The Catcher in the Rye."" First of all, Dignan and anthony represent the dual nature of Holden's personality in Catcher. Dignan is idealistic, while anthony is cynical and sarcastic. Secondly, Anthony's red pull-over strongly resonates Holden's red-hunting hat, a symbol of his uniqueness. Thirdly, the way anthony relates to his sister, grace, is eerily similar to the way Holden relates to his sister, Phoebe. (by the way, grace has a friend named Bernice, there is also a character named bernice is Catcher) Fourthly, Holden and Dignan both drink Tom Collins. These points may be more clear with repeated viewing after reading the novel. I encourage anyone who wants to comment on these observations to post a message relating to them.

165,anotherkumar2345,"Best movie ever, man.",10,17 November 2004,"This movie is excellent, as are all 3 Wes Anderson movies. I can't wait to see Life Aquatic. Those who don't understand the humor of this movie don't understand wit. It's refreshing to watch a movie that doesn't have to slap you upside the head with the humor. You have to be intelligent to get it. Many who have commented about this movie say they loved it, but they recognize it caters to a certain type of humor. I personally think that if you didn't think this movie was funny, you just need to go watch it again, because you probably missed everything. Wes Anderson uses a subtle humor which is easy to miss if you're used to the regular humor. However, unlike most movies, this is one that is funnier every time you watch it.",Bottle Rocket
166,buenosdiers,funny but carelessly made,8,16 September 2006,"too many continuity and other mistakes: in addition to everything on the list here I wonder why there's a police car with flashing lights in the residential neighborhood sitting in front of Bob's parents' house right after the three guys robbed the bookstore? Interestingly it's only there on one or two shots visible through the window, a minute later it's completely gone. Did the film crew forget to send the police away in time before they started shooting?! Very puzzling scene.other than that it is funny, mostly in the dialogs, rarely slapstick nonsense, so i understand that some people don't find it funny at all - the jokes are in the plot and the dialogs. it's convincing although it starts pretty ridiculous that the psychiatrist doesn't have a problem letting him out through the window. the end is surprising too.",Bottle Rocket
167,walleyjm,Cult Classic--Must See,8,22 April 2005,"So, you consider yourself an Owen and Ian Wilson fan. You've seen Old School. You've seen Zolander. You may have even seen The Royal Tenenbaums. But, have you seen Bottlerocket? Chances are good you've missed this cult classic. Irony, well executed comedy, subtlety-- that's what this movie has, that every great comedy has, but has been missing from nearly every comedy in the past five years. Remember the time when you could go back and watch a movie again and find more funny things you missed the last time? This is one of those movies. It demonstrates the talent of Wes Anderson, the Wilson Brothers, and really everyone involved in the movie. Go rent it, and watch it with your buds",Bottle Rocket
168,aidanmonks,Some good and some bad,7,22 April 2020,"The drifting, meaningless ""hang-out"" nature of this quirky, engaging crime/road/comedy flick is often fun and entertaining, and often far too meandering for its own good. Ultimately, what ""Bottle Rocket"" is about is confusion in both path and purpose, and this is clearly reflected in the spontaneity and energy of its central characters, their actions and their interactions. The film is perhaps overly reliant on its everyday dialogue and naturalistic, if not observably detached, relationships that give the film a documentary-like tone that perhaps doesn't work as an environment for typically Anderson-esque characters to inhabit. But this is Wes Anderson before Wes Anderson, which should be considered. As a debut feature, it's pretty darn good. Another potential problem is that the characters don't necessarily undergo any explicit character development over the course of the plot, but this isn't an overly serious issue as the stance can be taken that the whole point is that they don't learn and must continue to drift; on top of this, the greatest part of this otherwise average film is the fact that the characters don't actually need development, they are engaging and interesting enough to keep us hooked for a full 80 minutes with their dreams and moral callousness.",Bottle Rocket
169,Rorz,Yellow Jumpsuits,9,31 January 2006,"This is Wes Anderson's 1st feature length film. In 1994 a short version of bottle rocket was released, something which i have not seen but plan too. There are a number of things that Wes Anderson does with his films that don't necessarily force people to guffaw and shriek with laughter, but rather invites the audience to appreciate intelligent dry humour. Because that is essentially what it is and what makes it even more appealing, is the fact that it's all tightly wrapped up in outrageous plots, sets and costume design. (a deep sea adventure movie, a family of geniuses, a revenge high school drama, matching scuba suits, red Adidas tracksuits and of course those yellow jumpsuits).Bottle Rocket is Simply put...Brilliant. The Wilson Brothers are masters in their own right both playing off each others strengths. Owen the typical high octane overambitious rascal while Luke is the more sombre detuned unsure character just following footsteps. The script is pretty much flawless with Anderson and O.Wilson harmonising perfectly and sides with a typical Anderson soundtrack.I urge everyone to check out this mans work, even if its not your kind of thing. People say that you either end up loving or hating it, which may be true but at the end of the day it all comes down to entertainment. If people can't get a kick out of a scuba team decked out in synchronized outfits or an obsessive father and his track-field children, all the while making it look serious then i don't know the meaning of funny.All i can say is: Sign me up for one of those jumpsuits!",Bottle Rocket
