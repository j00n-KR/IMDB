0,TheLittleSongbird,Harmeless and cute if unexceptional family fare,6,31 March 2011,"This review is coming from a fan of the 80s animated TV show and of the childhood favourite that is The Chipmunk Adventure. I wasn't wowed over by Alvin and the Chipmunks, but it was a cute and harmless film. Same goes for its recent sequel.Starting with the pros of Alvin and the Chipmunks, the production values are great. The photography and editing are decent enough, the locations are striking and the animation on the chipmunks is very good. The chipmunks themselves are adorable, especially Theodore, not only by their appearances which epitomises cuteness but also their voices which are not too irritating. The soundtrack is quite catchy as well, the film bounces along quite nicely, Hill's direction is satisfactory and there are a number of funny and cute moments even if these moments are never more than hilarious.However, it does have its shortcomings. The story is rather predictable, as it can be with these animated/live action adaptations, and there are some clichéd subplots and characters such as David's romance with his neighbour. Some of the script is weak with some of the jokes falling flat, and I do agree Jason Lee is miscast as David looking rather ill at ease.All in all, cute and harmless entertainment but it is also unexceptional in the story especially. 6/10 Bethany Cox",Alvin and the Chipmunks
1,SnoopyStyle,strictly for kids,5,16 July 2016,"Dave Seville (Jason Lee) is a struggling artist and his music producer Ian Hawke (David Cross) rejects his latest song. Alvin, Simon, and Theodore are musical chipmunks. Their tree gets chopped down to be the Christmas tree in the record company. The chipmunks are accidentally taken to Dave's home. Dave discovers the talking chipmunks and their musical talents. Claire Wilson (Cameron Richardson) is his neighbor. Gail (Jane Lynch) is Dave's advertising boss.This is strictly for kids. The parents who bring the kids will find little to no laughs. Did I laugh at the poop joke? Yes. I don't think I was paying attention to the movie. It was more of a shock than funny but I still laughed. One can make fun of Jason Lee doing it for the paycheck but who doesn't. It's not like he's winning an Oscar any time soon. The chipmunks are mostly harmless fun. The music is good initially especially as a Christmas song. Once it goes hip-hop, it gets annoying.",Alvin and the Chipmunks
2,Horst_In_Translation,Not much in favor of this film,4,8 April 2016,"""Alvin and the Chipmunks"" is the first film from a movie franchise that is still running almost 10 years later. Unfortunately, quality is not the reason for that. I can't even be too mad at director Tim Hill here as the ones who are really to blame for this first film being mostly a failure are the three writers. It always baffles me how all of them can be so bad that they do not realize the mistakes of the others. At least, Ross Bagdasarian does not have to see this anymore. First of all, a few general notes about the film. It clearly aimed at younger audiences. There is no violence, no sexuality and basically nothing else that could scare them away from the film. The main villain is also not really evil in a psychological sense, just greedy and ruthless.One problem here is that there are no shades in the characters. they are either 100% good or bad and this always hurts a film. The movie relies a lot on the cuteness of the Chipmunks and even if they are cute, to me their unbearable voices made this almost painful to watch from time to time. And let us not forget: The core plot here is about the trio being great singers. But they are not. Not at all. I wish I could say there is a critical message about musicians having big careers with little talent because of their star factor, but nope. The Chipmunks are supposed to be seen as truly talented here.The good thing is that this weak film runs for under 90 minutes, so it is really not that long. The bad thing is that it still drags. For example, the romance story involving Cameron Richardson was so generic and not working at all. Badly written and the actress' lack of range is certainly not helping either, but in her favor admittedly not even Kate Winslet would have made this character work. I feel kinda sorry for her because it really destroyed her career. Lee as the title character is so-so, certainly has proved in the past that he is talented, but here he can not really show it. Same goes for David Cross. At least the character is somewhat fun in his over-the-top-ness.And finally a couple words about the title characters. It always confuses me that Alvin is one of the Chipmunks himself, so to me this is really ""dave and the Chipmunks"", but anyway.. the film did not have enough funny scenes for me to let me recommend it. The only one I found pretty entertaining was when the trio drank all that caffeine and they were jumping around like bounce balls afterward. But this is not an entertaining movie for 85 minutes and from a dramatic and emotional perspective in terms of the message on friendship for example, I cannot take it seriously at all. Not a good watch. Stay away.",Alvin and the Chipmunks
3,kosmasp,Family Entertainment,6,24 March 2012,"I wasn't that aware of the Chipmunks, but they do seem to have a following. And you can see their appeal to a younger (=kids) audience. They are cute and they can talk. What else do you need for a successful kids movie? Of course the story as it is, is not anything new or great or anything else.As an adult you have to make sure, to try to think as little as possible. A world where Chipmunks exists (an adult world that is) wouldn't look anything like this kids version of it. But you can't blame the movie for that. It's our cynical (realistic?) view that might spoil it for us. Still not the best kids entertainment, it will occupy and satisfy every need the little ones have.",Alvin and the Chipmunks
4,jboothmillard,Alvin and the Chipmunks,3,3 December 2010,"I remember watching the cartoon when I was a child, and being grown up I suspected I wasn't going to like this animated mixed with live action movie, from director Tim Hill (Muppets from Space, Garfield 2: A Tale of Two Kitties). Basically in the woods, in a farm tree, live the tuneful, squeaky voiced Chipmunks, Alvin (Die Hard 4.0's Justin Long), Simon (Matthew Gray Gubler) and Theodore (Jesse McCartney), and they are forced to head for Los Angeles when their home is cut down. They hide in the belongings of struggling songwriter David 'Dave' Seville (Jason Lee), who has his songs rejected by JETT Records executive Ian Hawke (David Cross). When the Chipmunks come out and reveal that they can talk, Dave doesn't want them near him, but he eventually agrees to let them stay a night, and that is when he hears their singing talent. So with a deal struck about living and working together, and Simon getting his glasses, he writes and the Chipmunks perform a variety of new songs, he may lose his other job, but he does attempt a dinner date with his love interest Claire (Cameron Richardson), which doesn't go well. Ian eventually finds out that the chipmunks Dave claims can talk and sing actually do, and without Dave knowing they are signed to his major record label to perform many records and stage gigs. Ian, being a bastard, wants all the credit and the Chipmunks to stay near him, so he lies that Dave doesn't really like them, and they leave him to live with Ian. But the exploitation of the Chipmunks is causing them to feel insecure, become overworked, tired and losing their voices, and Dave does rescue them, and they become a real family, with Claire next to him as well. Also starring Glee's Jane Lynch as Gail. I saw the completely random spoof in Disaster Movie, but it turned out that actually the real movie is almost as bad, or rather corny, to watch. Alvin, Simon and Theodore are reasonably cute and funny at times, but their voices do get on your nerves a bit, their songs, including ""Bad Day"", ""Witch Doctor"" and ""Funkytown"", don't do much for me, and Lee is only alright, overall it is easy for the kids to enjoy, but a silly family part-animated comedy adventure. Adequate!",Alvin and the Chipmunks
5,BA_Harrison,"It's like David Essex's Stardust, but with chipmunks.",8,2 March 2008,"When their tree is cut down and taken to the lobby of a record company, three singing chipmunks, Alvin, Theodore and Simon, meet and team up with Dave, a likable down-on-his-luck song writer, to become a world-wide pop phenomenon. But with a manipulative record exec out to exploit the furry trio for every dollar he can make, will fame and fortune prove to be rodents undoing?I liked 'Alvin And The Chipmunks. On the surface, it's a feel-good family film with a well-meaning hero, cute CGI characters, and a boo-hiss baddie, but it's also a savage indictment of the world of pop music that takes some vicious swipes at the industry's exploitation of minors. Kids will love the silly antics of the cuddly rodent trio; adults should enjoy the lambasting of a business in which image and money are all that matters.Jason Lee (from TV's My Name is Earl) is terrific as Dave, and does a convincing job interacting with his (non-existent) CGI counterparts, whilst stand-up comedian David Cross makes a great impression as slimy executive Ian Hawke. The talented rodents themselves are voiced by Justin Long, Matthew Gray Gubler and Jesse McCartney (although their voices are unrecognisable, having been altered drastically to sound like the famous fur-balls).The humour varies from the most basic (fart jokes and slapstick) to the less obvious and more intelligent (one of the chipmunks inhales helium from a balloon, resulting in an extremely deep voice; Hawke gives the exhausted pop-stars the chipmunk equivalent of a line of coke: a cup of coffee topped with cream).Alvin And The Chipmunks is fine family fun from start to finish, which grown-ups should find themselves enjoying as much as their kids. 7.5 out of 10, rounded up to 8 for IMDb.",Alvin and the Chipmunks
6,tavm,Alvin and the Chipmunks was an okay live-action update on '50s cartoon characters,5,28 January 2008,"After a month of purposely deciding NOT to watch this movie, I finally decided to humor my friend and see this update on Ross Bagdasarian, Snr.'s, creations from fifty years ago. There were pretty funny scenes when they surprised Dave in the beginning and a hilarious one when their manager, Ian (David Cross), gave each of them a caffeinated iced drink to give them energy. Other than that, this was a mostly by-the-numbers story of the pressures of success and the toll it takes on your health. In fact, the climatic scene when the rodent music group is revealed to be lip-syncing to their own vocals (because of their now-hoarse voices) seems aimed at those who go for such acts like Britney Spears and Ashlee Simpson instead of real musicians who play genuine music (though I don't consider what David Seville-Jason Lee-had auditioned initially for Ian authentic either). It's obvious that Lee (""My Name Is Earl"") and Cross (""Arrested Development"") took these roles for a large paycheck though Lee, at least, grows on you after a while. The music performances of the Chipmunks themselves are variable depending on whether you like any of the songs they sing here or the way their voices completely dominate though I admit liking their performance of ""Only You"", ""Funkytown"", and, of course, ""The Chipmunk Song"", and even the updated version of ""Witch Doctor"" (though I prefer the original recordings). Not bad for a reboot though for my money, I think I'd love to see the original version for television from the '50s, ""The Alvin Show"". P.S. What a treat to see the original album covers of The Chipmunks over the years during the end credits.",Alvin and the Chipmunks
7,michaelRokeefe,Furry singing sensations. The Chipmunks!,7,29 December 2007,"The furry three, Alvin, Simon and Theodore...the Chipmunks. Based on the song ""The Chipmunk Song"" that was #1 on the Billboard chart for four straight weeks in December 1958. David Seville created a phenomenon that would result in several Chipmunks albums and a handful of top 40 hits into the early 60's. There was even a TV cartoon series in the 80's. This live action/CGI comedy has the chipmunks run out of their pine tree home that is chopped down and delivered to a record label's headquarters. They sneak a ride to the home of down-and-out songwriter Dave(Jason Lee), who is astonished upon learning that the rodent trio can sing. His three new little friends end up wrecking his home and turns his career and life in a tailspin. Being push hard and heavy by record exec Ian(David Cross), the Chipmunks become a world-wide sensation with generations of adoring fans. The three worn out little singers want to rest and end up back home with Dave. There is some mild rude humor and what movie of this type doesn't. The voice of Alvin is provided by Justin Long. Voicing Simon is Matthew Gray Gubler and Theodore is Jesse McCartney. Others in the cast: Cameron Richardson, Jane Lynch and Kevin Symons.",Alvin and the Chipmunks
8,dbborroughs,Funny in a genuine funny unpretentious way,7,5 January 2008,"Alvin and his brothers crash the home of a frustrated musician named Dave and eventually find fame and fortune as singers. This is more a cartoon then the motion capture films of Robert Zemeckis. I mean that as a slap to Zemeckis who's animated creations (Beowulf, Polar Express) have less life than the all CGI Alvin and his brothers. Whats worse is this film with no pretensions and simply a desire to make one laugh is ten time the fun of most of the ""next big thing in movies"". Can you sense I liked this film? Can you sense that maybe, just maybe we have a mindless winner here? Aimed at kids the humor doesn't talk down to them. Oh sure the humor is childish and low brow but I laughed more times than I did at several recent ""good"" comedies (see Superbad). The music is quite good and the characters are appealing. I like how they play with the things we know about the characters for example how Dave writes the Christmas song we all know love and get sick of every year. There is a reason the film has been near the top of the box office since it opened, its funny, and not just for kids since lets face it there are only so many times Mom and Dad will drag the kids to see a bad movie repeatedly.",Alvin and the Chipmunks
9,view_and_review,"Chipmunks destroy, rebuild, repeat",6,14 November 2021,"""Alvin and the Chipmunks"" didn't translate well into a live action movie. This was an origin story of sorts. This movie tells of how Alvin (voiced by Justin Long), Simon (voiced by Matthew Gray Gubler), and Theodore (voiced by Jesse McCartney) came to meet Dave (Jason Lee), turn his life upside down, then subsequently change his life for the better.When the three chipmunks were taken in by Dave everything they did turned into a disaster, and that's what irked me. They destroyed his house, got him fired, and ruined a potential romantic reunification all within days of moving in with Dave. I was openly saying that I probably would've euthanised all of them. This same extreme scenario in a cartoon doesn't cause the same amount of grief for the viewer. In a cartoon the outlandish and the ludicrous are expected, so you roll with it. In one scene a place can look like a nuclear holocaust occurred and in the next scene everything can be right back in order with no problem. If the same thing happens in a live action movie it triggers a different response.The saving grace of this film is how quickly Alvin, Simon, and Theodore end up being a lifeline for Dave who was a struggling songwriter. After first humiliating Dave by not performing upon request, they went on to resuscitate Dave's career. When the chipmunks performed his songs for music exec Ian (David Cross) all was right with the world. But when Ian wanted to milk the chipmunks for all they had with endless performances and commercials, Dave had to come to the rescue.",Alvin and the Chipmunks
10,anaconda-40658,Alvin Sings a Terrible Tune.,4,15 March 2016,"Alvin and the Chipmunks (2007): Dir: Tim Hill / Cast: Jason Lee, David Cross, Cameron Richardson, Jane Lynch, Adriane Lenox: Computer generated version of the classic animation about fame. Dave's songwriting career hits rock bottom until he is put in possession of three talking chipmunks that know how to sing. Story is flat but director Tim Hill is improving after having made other terrible kiddie films such as Muppets From Space and Max Keeble's Big Move. Jason Lee does well as Dave who must arrange his lifestyle around the antics of Simon, Theodore and particularly the mischievous Alvin. Lee is just about the best element of the film because unlike Breckin Meyer in the lackluster Garfield films, Lee at least presents Dave as closely as we can remember. David Cross as a music producer is pathetically over the top. He is the villain and like many family film villains, he is a complete idiot. Cameron Richardson as Dave's ex-girlfriend is lifeless just like Jennifer Love Hewitt was in Garfield. The chipmunks themselves look great in their visual presentation but there is no evidence of decent screen writing. It is just an excuse to churn hard earned cash from viewers with as little effort as possible. While the nostalgia is there, this is the kind of misfire that will likely have viewers wanting to see the old cartoon, which was much funnier than this spectacle. Score: 4 ½ / 10",Alvin and the Chipmunks
11,DICK STEEL,A Nutshell Review: Alvin and the Chipmunks,8,12 December 2007,"Or at least that's how the theme song of the cartoon series sounded like, dug out from my subconscious. For those, like me, who have grown up in the 80s watching television cartoons like Mask, Transformers, He-Man, there are those which are less action based, such as Peanuts, and of course, Alvin and the Chipmunks, featuring the trio of Alvin, the de-facto ringleader, Simon the smart one (hence the cliché glasses) and the greedy Theodore.With cartoons from the past being remade into feature length movies, such as Scooby Doo and Garfield, yielding mixed box office results, what about these 3? To begin with, this is not quite like the cartoon series, in that the chipmunks are sized correctly, as with the other adaptations (no more handgun transforming to 50 foot robot), and curiously enough, they didn't need their body length clothes to hide their modesty, just a top coloured in the right way will do. And for Alvin, all is forgiven when the filmmakers finally remembered he sported a cap. Having effects wizardry helped to in bringing to life the trio of chipmunks, down to the last furry detail such as their hairdo.Those of us who have grown up with the series, will find multiple shades of story lines adapted from the cartoons all meshed into one here. It's a reworked origin story of sorts, so as to bring in a new legion of followers who haven't seen the series on television. Created by Ross Bagdasarian Sr almost 50 years ago, to have the characters translate to the big screen, bode well for its longevity, at least from the reaction I got from the kids, they are in love with the singing trio with all the clapping and the dancing along the aisle (yes!) each time they perform in their high pitched voices. I too was tempted to applaud, but that would be too geeky-like for those moments I became a kid again.Jason Lee stars as Dave Seville, the ""father"" of our singing sensation, who finds it a little difficult in trying to warm up to the notion of being family with animals. Having started off the wrong foot, it provided ample opportunity for that iconic scream ""Aaaalviiiiinnnnnnn!!!"", as he finds himself out of a career and with 3 extra mouths to feed. But as rehashed scenes and storyline goes, the Chipmunks soon prove to be taking the USA by storm with their brand of oh-so-cute voices and slick dance moves, that they become superstars in their own right.You'll know the drill from here, as dodgy music label producer Ian (David Cross) tries to undermine Dave to pry the cash-cows (heh) from the latter using despicable tactics, giving rise to being the sole adversary with the evil corporation type who's out to exploit and milk the chipmunks for what they're worth. Being a family friendly film, the theme of belonging and err, blood running thicker than water and profits, ring through, though I thought to toddlers, that might not actually matter, but to the parents bringing them to the theatre, then it's a reminder that children do appreciate being loved and having that pat on the back. Justin Long, Matthew Gray Gubler and Jesse McCartney provided the voices for our lovable chipmunks Alvin, Simon and Theodore respectively, though that didn't really matter in the final end product given that their voices had to be sped up to achieve that chipmunk effect. In fact, you and I could also be reading the lines, and applying the same technique to become chipmunks ourselves. And amongst the three, I dare say Theodore will win new fans in the very manja way it got portrayed. A key scene from the trailer had been reworked, so don't be surprised if you see that deviation - though for once, I thought the trailer version was better and closer to character.Like the movie says, ""they're talking chipmunks!"" so I feel that given the holiday season, and the tie-in with the movie to the season of good tidings, it may actually bode well for the film. There may be nothing truly new in the antics of the chipmunks, but they will probably still charm your socks off. So before you roll your eyes at yet another talking-animal film, give this one a chance, and I'm quite certain you'll be tapping your feet at the right moments too!So hit it again, Alvin, Simon, Theodore! And watch those plush merchandise fly off the shelves in time for X'mas! Stay tuned during the end credit roll which showcased some of the album art from their musical albums of the past.",Alvin and the Chipmunks
12,Smells_Like_Cheese,"Give it credit, it's a kids movie",5,18 December 2007,"When I first saw the trailer to Alvin and the Chipmunks, I was horrified, I'm 22 years old, I grew up with the chipmunks cartoon in the 80's and 90's. But after thinking about it, the chipmunks have been around since the 50's, my generation's chipmunks were a new introduction to us as well as this movie is to the kids of 2007. So my boyfriend and I checked out Alvin and the Chipmunks tonite just to see what it was about and you know what? I think it was cute for what it was. There are flaws here and there about the film, but it was meant for the kids, you have to admit. But the voices and characters are cute and the story works. It's a new story to the chipmunk's tale and adventures.Alvin, Simon, and Theodore, three singing, talking, and dancing chipmunks have just got their home(a tree, naturally) torn down and they are taken into the city. They jump into a basket being carried by Dave, a failing song writer, and they go home with him. He first shoves them off, but after hearing their singing, he comes up with the idea to write songs for them and see where it goes. They are a success and everything seems to be going very well for them. But until the music business takes advantage of them and tears their family apart, they realize that Dave is really who they need.Alvin and the Chipmunks of course is not the movie of the year, but for a kid's movie, it was very cute. Judging from my generation of Alvin, Simon, and Theodore, yeah, it was strange seeing them through what this generation considers cute and fun was a bit silly to me. I wished that they would've focused more on the building of the relationship between Dave and the boys, but I guess that might leave room for a sequel. Now, if you're looking for Citizen Kane, don't see this movie, if you're just looking for innocent fun and a cute family flick, I think you might enjoy Alvin and the Chipmunks.5/10",Alvin and the Chipmunks
13,disdressed12,it's all about family,9,21 May 2008,"i loved this movie.it 's mostly live action,except tor the chipmunks.they are CG animated.if you're feeling down,this movie should pick up your spirits.i found it hysterically funny at times.i think adults will love it as much as kids.it's a movie appropriate for the whole family,in my mind.there's nothing offensive,that i could see.there also a message in the movie,though it's very subtle.or maybe it's not that subtle.i guess it depends on the person.really,family and doing the right thing are the most important things.at least that's what came across for me.beyond that,though, i found the movie a riot,and it's really sweet and touching.i highly recommend it.9/10",Alvin and the Chipmunks
14,OllieSuave-007,"Kind of adorable, but looses steam.",5,1 April 2014,"Just like the cartoon, this is an adorable movie about chipmunks Alvin, Simon and Theodore, who meets frustrated songwriter David Seville (Jason Lee). Together, they set out fame as singers, hoping to make a positive impact in their lives. However, the unscrupulous record executive, Ian Hawke (David Cross), wants to exploit the Chipmunks, directly breaking up the family in the process.The movie does pick up the pace at first when the chipmunks first appear on screen and runs into Seville, ending up being his house mates. The chipmunks' singing were pretty fun to listen to; however, the story's pace looses steam somewhere in the middle, where the chipmunks lose their spunk and let the fame get the best of them. The story basically dragged on from there.The voice actors who played the chipmunks did a fine job, but Jason Lee wasn't very good as Seville and clearly wasn't right for the role. I would have liked to see him show more emotion and surprised expressions when he first spots three singing chipmunks (it's not everyday you see three, tiny singing critters). Unfortunately, he showed a disinterest in the role and lacked substance overall.This movie has its fun moments, mostly in the beginning, but not a terribly great movie overall. I'll watch this once, and then find something else to spend other Saturday nights with.Grade C-",Alvin and the Chipmunks
15,sddavis63,After A Promising Start It Runs Out Of Steam,4,16 January 2009,"As cute and adorable as they are, the story of three singing chipmunks just doesn't seem to have enough meat to it to sustain it for an hour and a half. I thought that the first half hour or so of this movie was well worth watching. It was fun, it had a few laughs in it, it was full of energy. Then it somehow just lost that. I wouldn't even say it faded away, because it seemed quite abrupt to me. The fun was gone; the laughter disappeared. My daughter noticed it, too. She's 4 - she laughed uproariously several times in that first part of the movie, then her laughter stopped. Perhaps it took on too serious a tone - the evil movie producer working the chipmunks to death. Something happened, anyway, and it wasn't for the better.Of course, the movie is trying to tell the story of how the chipmunks (Alvin, Simon and Theodore) began. Everyone knows the Christmas song. Here we discover how they met Dave and got their start. The movie is updated to the present time, although their real origin is noted by Dave's street address of 1958, which was the year when the animated singing rodents were first created. Jason Lee did a pretty good job as Dave and the chipmunk voices were also pretty good. David Cross as the evil Ian irritated me to be blunt, and I couldn't figure out the point of the character of Claire, played by Cameron Richardson. She added little to the movie. It's a movie you can watch with the kids - it's probably a movie you'd only want to watch with the kids, in fact. It gets a 4/10 from me.",Alvin and the Chipmunks
16,Robert_duder,An all new generation gets an all new update on something we ALL remember...and they think it's new!!,7,30 January 2008,"I grew up with these little Rock Stars. I had their albums...oh shut up you had at least one...I watched the cartoon show religiously, even during the Chipette Days and those were rough times. I admit I was pretty pumped to see Hollywood was going to make a live action attempt because I loved the first Garfield, one of my favorite movies, the second one...not so much...but I still knew Hollywood had potential to make this work and all these kids who don't have some of these great cartoon mascots to watch on Saturday morning anymore would be introduced to my little rodent friends. Alvin and The Chipmunks is not much more than what it was 25 years ago when it premiered and that is a GOOD thing. They don't make it dirty (with the exception of a few fart jokes which I hate but I'll accept because they are used sparingly) but they have an adventure fitting the singing trio complete with Dave. The best part is they do actually fit different situations and adventures into this one adventure which really made me remember the old cartoon where they were always getting into trouble. It wasn't a perfect movie...and it wasn't mind blowing for us old fans but I think kids loved it, obviously, and I am all for giving them back the Chipmunks.First of all I wasn't sure Jason Lee was the right choice for Dave (I always though a young Bob Saget would have been awesome) but as it turns out Jason Lee does a really incredible job EXCEPT...and this is very important...his first couple of ""ALLLLLVINNNN""'s sound completely ludicrous and forced and like he was still practicing in front of a mirror but his last one in the movie is much better. When cartoon Dave yelled it...he meant business but Lee sounded forced. Still he made a great Dave and I hope he comes back to do it again and again. Justin Long, Matthew Gray Gubler, and Jesse McCartney are the voices of the Chipmunks respectively. Now I don't know...maybe I'm wrong here but I'm pretty sure nearly anyone could have given their voices to the Chipmunks and have them altered properly so I can't say their voices were necessary to the film. That being said I think each one of them properly captured their respective Chipmunk's personality very well. I especially enjoyed Theodore who I always had a soft spot for...yes that's a fat joke. David Cross is really good as the power hungry manager who isn't very nice...and I say it like that because he isn't really a villain per se...just like the cartoon never really had villains but rather situations to overcome and that's exactly how they handled it.Certainly director Tim Hill has had some experience directing kids movies including the aforementioned Garfield sequel which I didn't like but I think it was more of an issue with the script. I think he redeemed himself fully by making an entertaining true to legend story about The Chipmunks. There were some genuinely funny parts...I was laughing out loud when the trio breaks into 'Funky Town' on Dave's window sill. Mostly though the film is definitely aimed at young kids...perhaps even younger than I would have expected but there is nothing wrong with that I really do hope for multiple sequels with carefully written, cute, funny, scripts and the whole cast returning for more. One thing I would have really liked to have seen was a little CGI remake of the original theme song from the Saturday Morning cartoon. That song was a staple to my childhood that I still sing all the time. Welcome back Alvin, Theodore, and Simon. 7/10",Alvin and the Chipmunks

But, will the Chipmunks benefit from Ian's guidance? Not likely! Alvin and the Chipmunks is a darling new addition to the holiday movie repertoire. First, the cast is nice, with Jason Lee giving an adorable performance as the harried Dave Seville, and Cross doing a great job, also, as the misguided studio boss. Richardson has a smallish role, which is too bad, for she is lovely and sweet. It would have been nice if the director had put a more obvious romantic encounter (a few kisses?) between Dave and Claire into the picture. Oh, well. As for the chipmunks, they are a computer-generated joy, being very funny, very appealing and very clever. Kids will fall hard for this trio, in my opinion, and want another film somewhere in the future. Then, too, the look of the movie is wonderful, from the nice costumes to the lovely California setting (Dave's house and neighborhood are beautiful) to the art direction. The script, while not totally original, has plenty of fun and frolic. Of course, after the initial Christmas song, the chipmunks get more heavily into ""hip-hop"" style with a syncopated new version of the ""witch doctor"" song, among other tunes. But, that is a minor element in the overall plot development. Mostly, let us all thank the studios for this film with a big ""chip, chip hooray!"" It is a very enjoyable flick that will plaster big grins on the faces of most everyone in the viewing audience.",Alvin and the Chipmunks

Of course he hasn't a clue what to write for the next track but three irritating chipmunks named Theodore(the cute fat one voiced by singer Jesse McCarthey),Simon(the geeky one with the glasses voiced by Micheal Gray)and finally the leader Alvin(voiced by Justin Long who mind you was great at the fast forward voice over for Alvin). All three of them help Dave with his songs and the manager for some record company wants to have the chipmunks for himself so that they will earn a living.The whole film was so stupid and annoying yet some parts were funny.

The acting was bad from lead Jason Lee, I feel like he didn't even try, which I can kinda understand, based on the material he was given to work with. If you wanna sit down with your young children to watch this, then they might enjoy it, young meaning like the 2-5 range, but anyone older is probably gonna be bored or annoyed. The chipmunks singing wasn't even that fun or entertaining either, once again, it was uninteresting and just downright bland. Sorry, but unfortunately the filmmakers behind Alvin and the chipmunks wasted the potential of what could've been an amusing film, instead they went for dumb and annoying and bland.

31,Beta_Gallinger,"A bland live action/CGI crossover adaptation of a hand drawn cartoon, like the 2004 ""Garfield"" movie",4,20 January 2011,"Alvin and the Chipmunks is a VERY famous cartoon musical trio. They were created decades before I was born, but I was 21 when this movie featuring the trio was released, and had been familiar with the anthropomorphic chipmunk characters for most of my life, having seen them in animated cartoons as a kid. The 2004 film adaptation of ""Garfield"" brought the hand drawn character to the CGI format and in a live action world, and this ""Alvin and the Chipmunks"" film does just that with these characters. I haven't seen the ""Garfield"" movie in several years, but can still remember its mediocrity, which means I wouldn't want to watch it again. After that, I was not desperate to see this later live action/CGI crossover when it first came out, and after finally seeing it over three years later, it's not too surprising to me how lacklustre it is.Alvin, Simon, and Theodore are three talking, singing chipmunks who live in a pine tree in a forest, but their lives change when this tree is cut down and taken to Los Angeles with them still in it! Dave Seville is a struggling songwriter in L.A. who is trying to get a song of his published. He presents his latest piece to Ian Hawke, Dave's former college roommate who is now a JETT Records executive, but sadly, he rejects the song. In the building where this happens, the Chipmunks' tree is put up and used as a Christmas tree. As Dave leaves, the Chipmunks jump into a basket he is carrying and are taken back to his house without him even knowing they're with him! When the struggling songwriter discovers them in his house, it isn't long before he puts them outside and refuses to let them back in. However, he is then surprised to hear the three of them sing, so he makes a deal with them. If they sing the songs he writes, he will provide them food and shelter. With the Chipmunks' talent, it looks like they could be the key to Dave's success, but they end up causing more trouble for him!What is probably this film's biggest problem is not a surprising one at all, and that problem is that the darn thing simply isn't very funny. I didn't watch the entire flick with a straight face, and there were very seldom times when I laughed just a little, such as Ian's reaction to Dave's new song near the beginning, but the vast majority of the gags failed to amuse me at all. The Chipmunks cause a lot of trouble for Dave, which is supposed to be good for laughs, but it isn't. There's one part showing Alvin putting what Dave thinks is a piece of chipmunk feces in his mouth to convince Dave that it's actually a raisin, and then spits it out when Dave is not looking! This is even worse than the chipmunk defecation scene in ""Enchanted"" (a film which came out around the same time as this ""Alvin and the Chipmunks"" adaptation and seems to be much more popular, but I honestly don't get what's so great about it), and it's making me queasy to talk about it! In addition to the major lack of funniness, the three main characters sing some familiar hit tunes, and generally cheesy ones if you ask me. Alvin and the Chipmunks certainly don't make these songs sound any better! Even though I didn't see this ""Alvin and the Chipmunks"" live action/CGI adaptation until over three years after I last watched the ""Garfield"" one, I can still compare them, and while both of them are bland, I would say that this one is slightly worse than the other. Both films are supposed to be comedies and severely lack laughs, but at least the ""Garfield"" movie doesn't have anything like the chipmunk excrement gag here! Well, I'm sure many would say these two movies are strictly for kids, and both of them were made years after my childhood ended, so maybe I'm being a little too harsh. I guess both films could have far more appeal to kids than adults, though 2007's ""Alvin and the Chipmunks"" may have more adult fans than 2004's ""Garfield"", so many could disagree with my opinion on it. Still, I most certainly don't suggest people watch this movie expecting it to be great entertainment for the whole family, nor should viewers expect it to be 100% clean. It spawned a sequel called ""Alvin and the Chipmunks: The Squeakquel"" in 2009, and you can be sure I intend to avoid that follow-up, just like I've continuously avoided ""Garfield: A Tail of Two Kitties"".",Alvin and the Chipmunks

And THIS is the type of movie I'll never show kids. And don't believe all the trolls that rate it 10!

WHO ELSE TAUGHT THAT JASON LEE WAS FUNNY? If I was the director I would have contacted and forced Robin Williams, Jim Carrey, Adam Sandler and Will Ferrell instead of Jason Lee. He is everything but funny, as he lacks charisma and credibility, and all the other actors are all incapable of good acting! The less I talk of the three chipmunks the better it is, they are so stupid and obnoxious at the same time, and the voice actors don't do nothing to make them likeable!

And if he's late why is he waiting in the reception of the building? I assume we're supposed to empathise with Dave and feel sorry for him? Not happening. Especially after hearing those song lyrics.Right then, to those chipmunks. I'm supposed to suspend disbelief a huge amount and accept they can talk. But forest creatures that know what a building is?

Oh, and the chipmunks in the moving bowls getting picked up? Oldest most predictable joke in the world.A good question would be how can chipmunks who don't live very long know a song from the 1970's? An even better one would be how is a song writer unable to sing his own song in tune (when he's pitching the Xmas song and the chipmunks won't sing).We're also supposed to happily accept that these chipmunks can read and write as well. Sorry, got to stop you there. NO! Sadly the ending was rather predictable once we saw the talking doll near the cage, I'd rather not have been lead by the nose to the ending like that? The trouble is Ian knows exactly where Dave lives and can get the chipmunks back easily (a tiny fact they seemed to overlook?).Its a feel good ending with Dave getting the chipmunks back & seeming to be getting on with Clare.

They must find a new home and they end up at Dave's house. The only thing that makes them different is that they can talk and even sing. Dave Seville (Jason Lee) is a struggling song writer who has a great idea about making the chipmunks a new show act, singing his songs. The only thing is that you must remember is that they are chipmunks and they act like chipmunks by tearing up Dave's house and interrupting his love life. However, they also begin to bond as a family with Dave becoming like a Dad. The chipmunks become a big hit and superstars with cute voices and fancy dance moves. The record company executive Ian (David Cross) sees big money in his future and takes over the act and pushes Dave to the side. Dave must try to save his little family before they becomes a show biz disaster.(My Comment) I enjoyed this movie because it brought back good memories. I can't believe that their first song was recorded 50 years ago. They have that certain sound that just makes you smile when you hear them. You recognize their sound immediately. The animated characters of Alvin, Simon, and Theodore are lovable now as they were 50 years ago. I always liked it when Dave would scream the name of ""Aaaaalviiiiiiiinnnnnnnnnnn!!!"" and Alvin would say ""OooooK!!!"" Those two words just make you smile.

But I found nothing amusing with the destruction of songs I knew. Nor did I really feel there was any character development between Dave and his love interest. And where were the Chipettes? The plot was corny and unbelievable. Somehow for the Chipmunks to attain such success rather quickly is just Hollywood interpreting life in an highly unrealistic way.

Dave was far more mild-mannered in the 80s cartoon series from memory, but Jason Lee's hoarse but amicable version of Dave suited this movie. He held his own against the CGI chipmunks, and of course, who doesn't love Theodore? The live action version of this movie is like the cartoon- cute! It beats the embarrassingly bad Garfield movie, where Breckin Meyer just didn't hold his own to a CGI Garfield. I think 'Alvin and the Chipmunks' is on par with the 'Scooby Doo' movies, although Lee doesn't quite pull Lillard's great impression of Shaggy. However, Jason Lee is great as Dave, and he does the father figure thing so well, so I warmed up to his interactions with Alvin, Simon and Theodore.I had no idea who did the voice-work, because of obvious altercations, but Justin Long as Alvin is commendable. Matthew Gray Gubler and Jesse McCartney had Simon and Theodore's voices nailed respectively. David Cross also adds to this movie as scrupulous agent, Ian Hawke, who uses the chipmunks tirelessly for his own personal gain. Not quite a memorable villain, but he does well as the slimy producer guy, and has some funny lines.The best thing about 'Alvin and the Chipmunks' is that it doesn't overdo the singing, and that works for me.

I then remember that the director did direct Garfield 2. I have to admit that the chipmunks are cute and that may draw kids/children to watch it. I do like some of their songs but hearing them sing got me a bit of headache. I am surprised that the cute singing of the chipmunks could match it. The director did a good job for that.

46,Dragoneyed363,"Cute, but not cute enough",4,3 April 2008,"I certainly was not expecting a masterpiece when I was prepared to view Alvin and the Chipmunks, but I knew I was, at least hopefully, in store for a fun and enjoyable time. Now, having seen the film more than once, sometimes unwillingly I must admit, I would say that it is an okay movie for kids, but that is it, nothing more. It follows the lovable story of Alvin, Theodore, and Simon, which has been around for quite a while, it is just less lovable as a big screen motion picture. When I started watching this movie, I immediately assumed it was going to be really good, because I do have to admit I kind of loved the old cartoons, what I saw of them at least, and was expecting that love to contribute to my viewing of the movie. I was actually sort of disappointed with what kind of film it turned out to be. Yes, of course kids would love this film and maybe some adults would like it, because it was a cute film, but, I would say it is definitely and never should be called great for the plain and simple fact that they tried way too hard at times with crappy jokes and humorless antics that the chipmunks I knew and loved from the TV series were a bit annoying.There were a few laughs, well, chuckles really, and I certainly was intrigued by the story plot, but overall I think there were a lot of things that could be changed, like how at the start of the film no one seems to notice the chipmunks running across the building floor and hopping into the muffin basket. I mean, they are small but not that small, and plenty of other things I could tell as well, such as the humorless antics I mentioned earlier, in example, toilet humor, which is sad that that seems to be a big gimmick in children films today, but I would rather not have to make this a spoiler comment by continuing to express my likes and dislikes of the film in full detail to the point where everyone is drooling a little; I'm sure by this point you have either agreed or disagreed with everything I have said. Well, show this to your kids because they will laugh their butts off, but as for adults and teenagers I would say to expect the unexpected which could be anywhere from you liking this movie as the kiddie film it is, to thinking it was just okay and being mildly entertained, maybe even disappointed if you are a really big fan of the old cartoon series.",Alvin and the Chipmunks
47,saarvardi,"Harmful, entertaining fluff for kids and for adults who've watched the show",7,9 January 2009,"I rented this last night and watched it with my wife. Although it's a kids film for all intents and purposes, it's still fun to watch - and some of the more subtle jokes struck a chord with us as well. Yes, the plot is tacky and predictable and David Cross overacted his ""evil"" role, but the overall experience left us smiling once the credits started to roll.So... why did we like this? The answer is the result of several factors, the most important one being nostalgia. If you were a child in the 1980's, there was no way you could miss out on Alvin and the Chipmunks, the hit animated series. The real-life version succeeds in being very similar - both in substance and in style - to the nostalgic show. Furthermore, another major point that contributed to this film's success (in my opinion) are the Chipmunks themselves (Alvin, Simon and Theodor) that are cuter and more adorable than ever in their CGI versions. Kudos to the animation department on that one.All in all, there are better and more successful family films out there, and Alvin and the Chipmunks is certainly far from being a deep and meaningful film that you'll want to cherish throughout the years. However, the good thing about it is - it never intended to become a classic. Instead, it sticks at what its good at being - harmful, entertaining fluff for kids and for adults who've watched the show.I gave it 7 out of 10.",Alvin and the Chipmunks

Suddenly their happy little house is cut down and put up in a work office building as a Christmas tree. There the threesome stumble across a music composer named Dave Seville (Jason Lee) who is forever struggling to impress his boss  Ian Hawkes (David Cross) who is a monster lurking beneath the surface  and achieve success.When Dave hears the chipmunks' marvellous singing abilities he agrees to let them live with him in his house. This action immediately sets off a chain of outrageously funny events as the mischievous trio turn Dave's life upside down.This charming hour and a half of nicely-done entertainment will be highly enjoyed by young and old.

They were very funny and made this whole movie. I didn't think that I would like this movie but I did for the most part. I liked it for what its worth. I didn't think it was any of my favorites, but if you want a fun kids movie this is it. I don't think that any other kids movie really compare to this one. It was pretty entertaining. It was pretty cute, and enjoyable. The acting played by Jason Lee who took care of the chipmunks was pretty good. It is not very easy to play a part where you have to talk to chipmunks. So I think that you have to give him credit for the most part. This movie didn't have any bad language or anything bad for children. It's the perfect family kids movie to see. The story was a little bit plain and boring. I thought the direction was very good. Some of the message were stating that you should do anything for family. When I left the theatres I said to myself I will rent that and see it more. Overall rent this movie and give it a chance it was pretty good. Their were very many scenes to laugh at. Have fun and enjoy this family movie.",Alvin and the Chipmunks
50,Criticman12,Hollywood these days...,2,21 December 2011,"When it comes to Hollywood adapting animated show's/Anime, people always ask, ""Why?"".One of Hollywood's worst adaptations of a cartoon show is none other than the CGI-Animated/Live-action movie, ""Alvin and the Chipmunks"".The story is about a guy named, Dave(played by Jason Lee), get's help from three chipmunks named, Alvin, Simon, and Theodore, because he's having trouble trying to make a good song.Good: I thought the acting was pretty good to be honest. Jason Lee does a decent job as Dave and the actor's who did the voices for Alvin, Simon, and Theodore, were pretty good.The CGI Animation was also good. I also liked how they had some of the song's because I was a fan of the Chipmunks when I was little.Bad: Everything else was boring. Even though I had a few chuckles here and there, I was bored.

51,simonparker1990,"Full of nostalgia, bound to make new fans as well!",8,20 December 2007,"When the box office figures for the US came in this weekend I was absolutely horrified! Sure I expected I Am Legend to do well, but the amount that Alvin and the Chipmunks got ($40+ million!) seemed absurd. Added to that the fact that it had earned more than Golden Compass did in its opening weekend just seemed ludicrous. The trailers I had seen seemed very mediocre and I wasn't looking forward to seeing it that much. So what a surprise, and a delightful one, to say how much I really enjoyed the movie. Sure its a kids movie through and through, and if you're not into talking animals then you will come out of this movie and criticise its plot, script and usual more adult things that critics criticise about. But if you go in willing to sit back and enjoy the movie you will realise there is a lot to enjoy. The three leads themselves, Alvin, Simon and Theodore if you've never seen the Chipmunks before, are all very likable and have some hilarious moments. The movie features consistent humour that ranges from fart jokes for kids, to some really subtle references, most notably one to Die Hard where for one moment I thought Alvin was going to complete his Yipee Kiyay moment and make the parents gasp in horror, he doesn't so don't get too excited. The script itself is pretty decent, there are the obligatory clunky sentimental bits, but generally the movie is consistent and full of laughs. It does outstay its welcome admittedly and feels that little bit too long, but these are mere quibbles as this is a movie that is bound to entertain many kids and adults alike, and the fact this did better than Golden Compass no longer frustrates me, as this is admittedly a much better movie than Golden Compass.The three leads of the movies are CGI creations, they are also surprisingly voice by Justin Long (Alvin), Matthew Gray Gubler (Simon) and Jesse McCartney (Theodore), though you'd never know as obviously their voices have been morphed so they sound much more like the Chimpunks. Anyway their voices sound perfect, Theodore's being the most distinct and will make many audiences world wide sit their and go awww. Alvin is a great lead and has some brilliant moments. Simon is the most dull of the three but has some pretty funny moments as well. But its when the three start singing the movie just comes to life, the Chimpunks Christmas song definitely gave the older members of the audience to relish in, and their rendition of Funky Town is by far the highlight of the movie. The actual adult cast themselves are pretty decent. Jason Lee, from My Name is Earl, is a decent enough lead and at least does better than the adult actors in Garfield who seem almost asleep. When the sentimental stuff kicks in admittedly he does stumble a little bit, but generally Lee is on top form and definitely isn't always overshadowed by the chipmunks. David Cross does the traditional villain role pretty well, although he does start to irritate after a while and when he goes into pure evil mode later on in the film he just seems a bit silly. But by far the worst character in the movie has to be Claire, played by Cameron Richardson, she is out of place in this movie and the romance thing never plays off at all.Where Alvin and the Chimpmunks succeeds where movies such as Garfield and Scooby Doo have failed is the fact it succeeds in the comedy department. Sure the movie has its nostalgia factor, but if it wasn't funny then the movie would be a disaster. Thankfully this is a very funny movie. The fart jokes are obviously aimed at kids, but thankfully there aren't that many of them, in fact when you compare this to something like Garfield you realise how well the scriptwriters have done keeping this to a minimum. Slapstick is obviously a big part but done very well and there are many set pieces that will please audiences. The songs as I have said are definitely the highlights and as I've said before the Funky Town rendition is just pitch perfect. There are many one liners to be found as well amongst amongst some of the clunkers that appear later on. The sentimental scenes also are not as horrific as some more recent family movies have been. In fact some of the scenes generally do warm your heart.Overall Alvin and the Chimpunks is a surprisingly good movie that is definitely something parents should take their kids to see this Christmas. While maybe not as good as Enchanted this is definitely better than Golden Compass, and kids will lap this up. So the obligatory sequel that will arrive seems perhaps a more joyful event then it seemed before I saw this movie. In fact a sequel now seems quite a decent idea.",Alvin and the Chipmunks

This movie is more okay than bad. I mean other than the fact you hear squealing chipmunk voices throughout the movie you also get a message that a lot of people miss, and it's about being young and famous. Yes it can be mediocre having chipmunks as well ""kids"" but I did feel the message this movie was trying to make, and the songs aren't that bad either, if anything I find the Christmas one a bit memorable. And there were some funny moments especially with Alvin sabotaging Dave and his date and when all 3 go crazy from drinking coffee. But the best thing about this movie is the message and portrayal of the life of a kid/teenager surviving in the music industry trying to be successful. Ian is the portrayal of some of the music managers in this world. And compared to 2 and 3 in the quadrilogy, this isn't bad.",Alvin and the Chipmunks

A truly witty writer would have not only had a field day with that, but it would have eliminated the major problem of the entire audience wondering how a digital keyboard can become completely soaked but then work perfectly.There were at least 10 other similar situations.

55,jantoniou,wispy-thin family fare,5,26 December 2007,"There's little of merit to extract out of this celluloid extension to the ""Alvin and the Chipmunks"" franchise except, perhaps, a few laughs here and there.Jason Lee appears to have succumbed completely to the pull of the dollar by appearing as the fictionalization of the already fictional Chipmunks' songwriter, ""David Sevelle,"" simply called ""Dave"" in the movie.Down on his luck, ""Dave"" comes across the preternaturally gifted Chipmunks who are ousted from their forest abode and for whom he writes a song that becomes an instant hit - not unlike the original million-selling Chipmunks' hit in 1958.Any movie must have a conflict to be interesting and it comes in the form of another able comic that also seems to be trolling for a paycheck here, David Cross. Playing slimy record exec Ian, he seduces the Chipmunks into a fancy, happy-go-lucky lifestyle that caters to their every whim. Stick-in-the-mud Dave proferred upon the 'Munks a more conservative, put your money in the bank for a rainy day kind of anti-M.C. Hammer money management philosophy. The 'Munks will have none of it and instead go out a barn burning world tour courtesy of said slimy record exec looking to milk the Chipmunks for all their merchandising worth.Lee appears nearly robotic in his scenes and reluctantly echoes David Sevelles of yore--""Allllllvvvin!"" For a guy who used to be on the cutting edge of indie comedies, it feels like an awkward casting fit, but perhaps this is what his handlers in Scientology want.All this said, the Chipmunks themselves deliver on some pretty good comedic moments. My kids loved them and even us adults got a few amiable yucks out of what is otherwise a bland family movie. I will give the filmmakers' credit for not making them too cutesy, but rather sufficiently anthropomorphic so that we can enjoy them without gagging on the gee aren't they cute chipmunks factor.Though Dave has a pretty love interest, they keep the family-un-fair double entendres and innuendos down to a bare minimum. You won't need to explain much to your children if they ask.Worth the investment to go a movie theatre? Probably not unless you get a good matinée special where they have popcorn and a coke for $5. Otherwise, the kids can enjoy it on DVD in maybe 3 months.",Alvin and the Chipmunks

59,tommystans,It tried,5,17 May 2014,"I remember seeing this movie in early 2008, in Australia movies that were released in America during the Christmas period either come out on Boxing Day or around January of the new year. I liked it at first but after seeing the movie again it has its own problems. The main thing is the pop cultured referencing of the songs, which are made as a novelty item. It would've been a better plot line if we see how the chipmunks brought their success from the ground up in the 1950's rather being a modern take of it. This film just retcon's everything from the 1983 television series. We see Alvin, Simon and Theodore just met up with Dave in the movie as wild rodents in the movie. In the TV show we see them being adopted by Dave after there mother, the chipmunks', abandoned them as she thinks they won't survive through a terrible winter. The same can be said about the Chippettes in the second film, instead of fledging from Australia from a horrible orphanage they were mailed to the record company in L.A.The good thing though is that around the first half of the film they were kept in character, Alvin, Simon and Theodore, like in the original TV series. Alvin the troublemaker, Theodore the food lover and Simon the smart one. Then they screwed up later on by giving them the 'fame gone to their head' treatment. But I will say it had tried to be good, it's not great but it's not horrendously bad. But in my opinion, they should reboot the whole franchise and fix up every mistake that was made and give it some credit to the 80's TV show. Have the plot set in the 1950's when 'Witch Doctor' was a hit and maybe each of the sequel focus on different decades. I know they modernized things for the younger generation of today, but characters like Alvin and the Chipmunks are classic characters that have fans from the past. The TV show and the 1987 movie, even though it wasn't great but at least it was fun, had something valuable to watch to look back at and these movies don't.These films will be nothing but outdated pop cultural fads, I know the same can be said about the 80's TV show but some 80's songs manage to be timeless, like Michael Jackson.",Alvin and the Chipmunks
60,H_Spengler,Decent & Safe for a young crowd,6,22 November 2008,"My godsons (4 and 2 respectively) really liked this, so I give it a 6/10. I wanted to show them a movie that would hold their interest but also was safe and kid friendly.I never really got into Jason Lee, only liking sporadic performances of his (favorite to date is Dogma) but i've been warming up to him lately. In my youth I used to watch the cartoon all the time, so I was curious to see what they could do with it on the big screen. It's definitely a kids movie, but it's not too bad, and actually more of a kids movie than a lot of kids movies are! (Shrek maybe a cartoon, but IMO it's not for kids!)There was no swearing in this film, nothing scary, lots of feel good lessons about family, friendship and teamwork, nothing complicated that would sail over young ones heads, and lots of repeatable and catchy music tunes that we found ourselves humming for days afterwords. (most notably the famous ""Christmas"" song that is still heavily played during the season to this day!) I can think of only one example of potty humor in this entire movie, and it's forgivable (my godsons giggled.)The movie was filmed in a very positive light. The chipmunks were CGI of course, but this was necessary as it was not an animated feature, and puppets would've looked cheesy for the complex moves they did.I liked how they kept Dave humble and a down to Earth guy, he was the perfect father figure and counter balance to the 3 chipmunks. David Cross is perfect as always playing his usual sarcastic character. I was impressed with Lee in this film, as both he and Cross really seemed to be enjoying themselves making it, that always adds to quality.

Well, I never had a father like David Seville, but I always wanted one, and yes my father did yell at me just like Dave does with Alvin.I thought Jason Lee was perfect as David Seville, a lot of people didn't think he did an okay job, but I loved him. I liked the reference to My Name is Earl, I thought it was very funny.I always wondered how Dave hooked up with three chipmunks, and now I know. I thought it was great how the 4 hooked up, and I do remember watching the episode when Uncle Ian showed up, and I wasn't really a fan of him. It got worse when my parents had a boy and named him Ian, and he was always a trouble-maker, still is, lol.It was a great movie, wasn't the best, but it was still a good movie to watch. My five yr. old nephew loves the chipmunks and he thought it was very funny, a lot of kids will like this one, but I think pretty much it's a movie the whole family can enjoy.

However Alvin and the Chipmunks is a delight.I had low expectations of this film when it first came out and I did not want to see it. I remember watching Alvin and the Chipmunks as a cartoon series in the 80's and also The Chipmunk Adventure and I didn't believe this would be nearly as good and would not be worth seeing.Boy was I wrong.The film is cute and all the Chipmunks fit their respected personalities.The Chipmunks may not be for everybody but I love them. I have seen the second film and the new one coming out looks very funny and I am looking forward to seeing it.Alvin and the Chipmunks will surely not disappoint.,Alvin and the Chipmunks
64,rorymacveigh,"Has some OK moments, but bears little to no relation on the original concept",3,18 July 2012,"It truly is a shame when cartoon hero's of your childhood are made into Live action films, it really is, and this is a prime example. Rather than leaving the Alvin and the Chipmunks franchise alone and letting it end on the high note it did with Alvin and the Chipmunks meet the Wolfman, they decided that a live action version had to be done, and this just doesn't meet the bar that the last animated feature left off.The first problem appears in the first 2 minutes, the Chipmunks design. I realise the idea of a live action film is to make them look realistic, but the problem is we don't want to see Alvin and the Chipmunks in a realistic light, we always remember them as the almost childlike chipmunks of the 1980s with their long roll-neck jumpers and Alvin's signature cap. The idea of separating fiction from reality is to make it look unrealistic, and that's what the original series did well, made the Chipmunks look more personified and thereby more relate-able, here they just look like the rodents that chipmunks truly are so you can't exactly relate to them.Second problem is the fact that the film doesn't seem to grasp each of their individual characters. The original series has Alvin as the mischievously egotistical one, Simon as the intelligent pillar of reason and Theodore as the cutesy and innocent one with a heavy appetite. Here, they all appear to be just Alvin, mischievous, egotistical and not really cute at all. The thing that also made the original chipmunks relate-able was the fact that they had individual personalities, rather than just one stereotype like this movie has. Although this does lend itself to some humorous moments within the film, they're unfortunately few and far between and when they do show up you hardly notice them.Thirdly and probably the most important problem, the music. As well as having a critical overview on films, I have a critical overview on music, and this film seems to have no effort in giving Dave a chance to be the musical genius he was depicted as in the previous series, being the one who wrote their songs and oversaw their concerts. Also the music Alvin and the Chipmunks were more often than not known for was 50s Rock, 80s Rock, Symphonic Melodies and other Classic Tracks. Here, they just borrow from other artists and make either Rap or Hip Hop tracks, which to my mind requires little to no brain power to sing or make, just talking to the beat of a drum machine about one's sexual experiences, but that's beside the point. What was important was that Dave in the original was truly the music man, making the songs whilst sometimes borrowing from existing tracks, but at least the music was enjoyable and had something you could bounce to, here Dave doesn't write one song nor does he show up that often, its more so the sleazy villain that does the role of what Dave would normally be accustomed to.Overall, this film isn't its best and though you may consider me to have set to bar really too high for this film based on the last feature length chipmunk film, it probably wouldn't come close to the mark even if I lowered it. It's got a story (to a point), the humour is there (somewhere) and at least Alvin is his usual up to no good self (at the cost of Simon and Theodore losing their personalities). As for the rest, sadly not my cup of tea.",Alvin and the Chipmunks

I was bored out of my mind. The entire plot was ridiculous and the chipmunks weren't lovable at all. Normally you fall in love with Alvin's rebellious charm. Charmed, I was not. I have to be honest, I could not sit through this movie. I think I got up forty five minutes into it. It couldn't keep my attention, how is it supposed to keep the attention of a child?

70,rorymacveigh-66661,Oh dear...,1,29 March 2015,"As someone who grew up on shows such as Alvin and the Chipmunks, I could rip this film apart for all the flaws, removal of character and overall enjoyment that the original cartoon had. But I'll try to contain my frustration at this heinous film and look at it with some objectivity.What's the pastrami? Three Chipmunks with a talent for singing named Alvin, Simon and Theodore live in the forest leading a less than stellar life. This all changes when their tree is cut down with them in it and taken to Los Angeles. There they come across Dave, a struggling songwriter who has a tough time getting his songs green-lighted by his boss Ian Hawke. This all changes when he finds that the Chipmunks have a natural talent for singing and therefore takes them on to help him make music, unaware that his evil boss is planning to work them practically to death so as to make the most money.So, what's fundamentally wrong with this movie? One, it's live action. Why oh why is everything live action these days? The great thing about animation is that characters can be drawn to different styles and in forms that make the more appealing to the eye. The idea usually is to incorporate human features to make the characters relatable and dare I say give them a cute factor.In live action from, they look like dancing, singing rodents that really do put you off the whole thing. They're not designed well and it really doesn't look that good.Next, the story, which is about as 100% recycled as you can get. The usual 'Trouble in Paradise' story has been done a million times before and will probably be done a million times again. Next, the characters, which are dated husks of their former selves. In the show the attachment of the characters to Dave like a father makes up a majority of the show's charm and likability, as well as having personalities that seemed really quite timeless because their design and character traits had been a constant since their original conception back in the 1950's. In this, they get famous, Dave disappears for a while whilst the Chipmunks are worked to within an inch of their lives to record and cover songs. At the same time, their attitudes have been updated to conform to what was currently 'hip' at the time, taking on a rapper persona with the Hoodies and Backward caps. This is not a good choice as come 5 or 10 years down the line this whole fad would have shifted and these will be just lost in a time that people will look back on and laugh. I dare say already the who thing is rather dated, and it's only been 8 years!Now the songs I won't criticise because I'm not here to judge music. Although I personally hate every single one of the songs played or covered in this movie, I suppose they are trying to appeal to what was 'hip' at the time. But musical tastes are something that differs from person to person so I'm not going to condemn nor support the soundtrack on my own opinions. If you happen to like them that's okay with me.Overall, I seriously can't recommend this film, for fans of the original Chipmunks or the new audience in general. The story is recycled, the characters are dated and uninteresting, and the fact that it's live action is probably the biggest sin because it doesn't make them look cute or relatable like they were in the original. If you want to see the Chipmunks do what they do best, watch the originals from the 1980's as this is not a good introduction to the characters or the story at all!",Alvin and the Chipmunks
71,alexandrajade,An awful lot of fun,6,27 December 2007,"It surely is no miracle of modern film-making (or script-writing, for that matter), but if you go see this film hoping for either, look in the mirror to see who's to blame. It's a tame, predictable, nonthreatening story with a lot of chuckle-inducing antics and one-liners from SINGING CHIPMUNKS. An enjoyable way to blow an afternoon.Lee is serviceable as the hard-luck good guy straight man for the CGI critters who, of course, gets the girl in the end. I enjoyed Cross' role as the main antagonist, though as someone who hopefully ends up in the music business in the future I actually found him somewhat sympathetic! None of the 'munks are voiced by particularly big name stars, though even the most recognizable, Alvin (voiced by the 'Mac' in the 'Mac and PC' ads) is unrecognizable.Bottom line, it's a goofy little chucklefest. If you're up for that, go and enjoy. If not, there are lots of other pictures out there.6/10",Alvin and the Chipmunks

73,ilikepuppies,"Kitchen Looks Good, but There's Garbage in the Fridge",2,26 July 2008,"I'm now on a mission to solve a riddle posed by this experience.Consider: This film is exactly what it criticizes. The makers of this are uncaring corporate thugs, bent on bastardizing a pre-existing product into a more modern saleable product. Now ponder that this film is about just that; it's a story of the same kind of thuggery, and delivers the message that it's wrong. This criticizes formulism while clinging firmly to its own formulas (gas jokes and physical gags for the 8-year olds, subversive references to ""nuts"" for their parents, et al).So how does this happen? I have two theories.The first is that there were some unhappy folks involved in the actual creative decisionmaking taking stabs at their corporate decisionmaking counterparts, who are most likely oblivious. This is the theory I would prefer to believe, as it would involve some deliciously subversive haranguing of financiers and management. That I like.But maybe more likely is the idea that the higher-ups are actually in on the joke. That's much more troubling because it would imply that it was an engineered contradiction. In other words, studios know that they are serving us garbage, but are carefully and subliminally concealing it as such. After all, one who criticizes an idea implies that he can be trusted to not employ that idea.I take a special interest in what these businesses are shoveling at my kids. This kind of formula film is damaging, downright demeaning to any person of any age. Yet children are too inexperienced to recognize it as such, so it's good advice for parents to ride along with their kids through these experiences and help them navigate through these obstacles.Teach them that real art isn't born at a boardroom demographics meeting.

74,laci-5,I was expecting much worse,5,5 December 2007,"A CGI+ live action movie from the director of Garfield 2.? Also, once again a movie with a loser ""dad"" character and some very bad children (okay, they are chipmunks but behave just as children as they are kids) like Daddy Day Camp and others? Actually, the chipmunks make all the difference and save the movie. What does not work with Garfield (warm Hollywood-emotions and the animal as a fast rock star-type) works perfectly with the chipmunks. Also their animation is never off-setting as it quite often was with Garfield. And even after almost 50 years, it still makes you smile to hear them singing. When you watch the trailer you can see that poo-eating part which I see is in the movie just to bring in that type of audience - I think it is a bad idea as it makes others think twice before buying ticket for this movie which has only one fart joke and this poo joke of this type of ""humour"". Otherwise it is watchable and the animated characters are even lovable (Jason Lee is not so great in this). It was a fun travel back in the time when I watched them as a child. Not a big movie, also there are problems with the pacing but it's much better than expected.",Alvin and the Chipmunks

This reboot of the squeaky-voiced chipmunks just shows how annoying film making can get. The opening musical number is cute, but the film then turns into an immature and predictable film about the ""glory"" of the music industry. Jason Lee is not able to use his clever comic timing to save it. The chipmunks and Alvin simply do not have chemistry or the interesting characteristics needed to make a movie like this fun.

78,therubixtheory,"Started off great, then became extremely annoying",4,29 December 2007,"I hate seeing the beginning, because i as a (trying to become) writer just cant stand it when i see something on the big screen or in an anime that i thought of ages before watching.basically when i was sixteen i wrote a crap script for a CGI about a monkey, and at the beginning i wanted the monkey and his three friends to sit in a tree and sing ""Hey Hey Were The Monkees"", eventually i abandoned this idea for a more realistic storyline.Then wouldntchaknowit, the movie Alvin and The Chipmunks starts off with them in a tree, collecting acorns and singing the song Bad Day, it makes me laugh thinking about it, i just hate it though when that happens, well, at least i got to see first hand that the idea i thought of would've actually been funny.Alvin and The Chipmunks pretty much sticks a knife into the throat of the concept of normal reality, in simpler terms, it's completely designed to be unbelievable.I've always said i've hated that writers tend to sacrifice the laws of reality for (lack of a better word) toilet humor, how can three chipmunks even know the words to such songs let alone sing them in English, they never think do they.anyway the film started off pretty well, and they did a good job of modernising it, but something went seriously wrong the moment they sang the Witchdoctor song, cute at first but then just became nauseating. the acting deteriorated, the jokes became lame, the dialogue became childish and David sevilles acting turned from bad to awful.the whole film turned highly predictable after the halfway mark, and quite frankly became a rip-off of a Fosters home for imaginary friends episode, in fact i think i've seen the same storyline in three different movies or cartoons.the animation is pretty good i must say but when it's in a film this bad i often wonder why people give them the money to produce it.what kinda annoyed me about this film is that the chipmunks were often referred to as ""Rock Stars"" yet they were clearly performing the in the somewhat RNB genre since they were made to wear flashy clothes and bling, on a personal note i think RNB should be banished.Really, if you like the laws of reality, hate RNB and are a true fan of the original chipmunks then don't go see this movie, or at least don't see it by paying for it.",Alvin and the Chipmunks

I can agree that Jason Lee wasn't the perfect person to play Dave but he still did a pretty good job. I mean, let's be honest here and admit that none of the acting is great in this movie. It isn't horrible but it isn't great either. The thing is that the acting is on par for 90% of kids films. Also, how much can we really expect when it is a story about 3 singing chipmunks? The delight of the film and what people (my family anyway) want to see is the chipmunks get down and boogie. This movie in my mind accomplished everything and more that it might have set out to accomplish. It is extremely funny at times and also has a few heart felt moments. The overall story was very good. There are some morals taught here and you don't always see that with these types of movies. If you are in for some slapstick chipmunk boogie and rock and roll then check this out. I can almost guarantee you that any kid under 12 will love it and it is still enjoyable for adults.",Alvin and the Chipmunks
81,katzinoire,For The Love Of Family,9,18 December 2007,"My 5 year old begged me to take her, and I complied. I had brought a book and an itty bitty book light so I could read during the movie-only to find I didn't even need it.From what I could see, the movie has two messages: the importance of family and also a plug about making young talents overwork themselves with no consideration for their well being.The family part is how Dave Saville-a perma-bachelor who seems to not have his life together enough that he apparently lost a very sweet photographer girlfriend, Claire because he was all over the place-and how he becomes a manager, friend and eventual father figure to 3 talking Chipmunks.We have Alvin, the vain go-getter, who is always got a scheme up his sleeve, Simon, a genius who is always using his noodle to solve situations and Theodore-a loving, sweet emotional dear heart who appears not that smart, but really is just sensitive.Dave ends up with the boys by sheer accident and after learning they can sing, decides to write songs for them, hoping that the songs he writes will perform better being sung by the boys. After a disastrous audition, Dave gets mad and yells at the boys, only to have Simon point out that they had stage fright, and also reminding Dave they are just kids. Dave realizes this and feels bad he yelled at them.The boys decide to make up the fact they blew the impromptu audition by taking a cab to the music producers house, tricking him into letting them in, and eventually singing for him. Ian (the music producer) is amazed, however is manipulative, showering the boys with presents, planning huge events, piling on the junk food, and with no concern for the boys well being.Dave on the other hand becomes a really good parent (even if he doesn't want to admit it). He still has a lot to learn, but his concepts are in the right place. A great example is that for Christmas, he gets the boys savings bonds (not exactly a prime gift, but one that shows he thinks about their future). He also puts the boys money away, fairly. The boys show how they feel about Dave by presenting their Christmas gifts to him: Alvin, in true Alvin fashion, gets Dave a wallet-Dave's existing wallet to be exact, Simon has created a paper clip compass and loving Theodore has drawn a picture of Dave and the boys, the family he explains.Ian on the other hand does what he can to bump Dave out of the loop, and due to some confusion over a letter Dave originally wrote before committing himself to the boys, gain full control of the boys. He manages to do this, working them hard, giving them tons of coffee to keep them alert and awake to handle the long hours(a thin veiled allusion to managers giving performers drugs to stay awake), all the time raking in the cash and having the boys suffer for it. The backup singers and dancers even notice this mistreatment and comment on it, feeling sorry for the sweet boys(who apparently treat them very well, as Dave taught them to).Dave discovers this, and eventually gets the boys back. The ex-girlfriend plot was the weakest area of the film, however the director was smart enough to keep it in the background-although the ex does serve a purpose at a key point, making it possible for Dave to access the boys with her press pass and camera. She also chides Dave on the whole not admitting he really is a dad to the boys. So weak as that plot point was, it had some use.All in all hysterical fun, some great stuff to poke fun at (Dave is supposedly struggling as a song writer, but manages to have a sweet house, all tricked out with appliances, actual food, and knick knacks) and the funniest of those was noted by my 5 year old-Dave finished writing the song and sits the boys down to practice it-they start singing immediately- to which my daughter said how amazing that was. I asked her if she meant the singing Chipmunks and she said no, they learned the words so fast!! I will admit I was skeptical about Jason Lee playing Dave Saville, but he worked very well. All in all a great film to see with your kids, and no itty bitty book light and reading materials needed.",Alvin and the Chipmunks

The story is too unrealistic man. The kids will like it though because of the talking chipmunks. The one thing that I liked although is the editing part. The movie is perfect length. But seriously man it is something you cant digest. I mean movies are unrealistic but this one did not gave you a feeling that it could happen.

The only reason you're still there is because you brought your kids and you can't leave them alone in the theater. You might catch a nap.Tim Hill should never work in film again after delivering this awful piece of junk. He manages to take a decent comic actor in Jason Lee and turn him into a robotic, unsure actor in this production.I didn't have much hope for this movie in the first place, I admit. If it weren't basically the only family film I could take my son to around Christmas, my wife and I wouldn't have gone. God, I wish we could go back in time and stop ourselves. I leaned over to my wife about 10 minutes in to tell her what a stinker I thought it was, but she beat me to the punch.I'm not kidding. It's putrid. Only David Cross's terrific-as-usual work saves this review from being only 1 star.The story is cloying, insulting and stupid, as might be expected for a movie in this genre (although the recent ""Curious George"" was blissfully intelligent and enjoyable). The acting is mostly poor. The decision to ""update"" the Chipmunks songs for today's audience was inadvisable at best and boneheaded at worst. It does not work.The chipmunks of old were clever, mischievous and sly. These chipmunks are dumb, somewhat mean-spirited, obnoxious, and in a surprise, needy to the point of uselessness.Either as a retrospect, a tribute, or as a completely new production, this film totally fails.

So, let me say this: There will be no problem letting her 7 year old watch it.I kinda enjoyed it too seeing how I had to be dragged to it. But once there I was not bored and there seemed to be a crowd that apparently was expecting a treat of some kind as several appeared to be veterans of earlier showings who had then gone out and grabbed their posse to watch it again (only with them this time).Nice way to spend a Saturday with the kids and grab a laugh or three.

This could have resurrected a novelty group that stopped being cute and funny fifty years ago. But what this movie did is pander to adolescent bathroom jokes. There are fart jokes, butt jokes, poop jokes, and general crude behavior from three weasels that would cause most parents to have a cardiac arrest if their kids acted like that.I'll admit there is still a good moraleven if it was just the parents who caught it. It was the message about family that was a consistent theme throughout the movie. There was also the strong message about the danger of child actors. This does not however make up for setting a very bad example for the younger audience.This can still be a kid's movie, but with adult supervision.

88,digitalmaleficus,"Good Movie, Sad Reality",7,22 February 2008,"I went into this movie expecting another ripoff of my past, ultimately destroying a franchise and all nostalgic ability. I am glad to say this is not one of those.One thing I notice myself doing a lot is laughing. There's a lot of giggle moments and a few laugh out loud moments especially involving Theodore. Alvin plays just the same as I remember from my kid-dom days as being a furry version of Dennis the Menace. Simon however seems more like a semi smarter but not smart chipmunk how I remember him being more of a rodent Einstein. Perhaps thats just my own mis-perception. Which brings to mind Dave. I think he is not only the worst portrayed but also worst actor chosen for the role. This isn't Jason Lees fault as much the casting director, for he struggles to play the role, but is just totally wrong for it.The movie does emphasize one major fact and thats how Hollywood pretty much destroys everything for a quick buck, which is kinda ironic considering the movie is a remake of an old franchise which personally would have been happy being left in the past for old time nostalgia.Overall the movie is a good adaptation of an old classic franchise which personally I loved watching and unexpectedly swooned at the beginning of the movie when they sing their Christmas Special original (for those of us who remember.) I especially recommend this for parents wishing to share their past with a modern present which will be enjoyed by the modern era of children.Im glad to see my expectations were far bested, by a job well done, despite its what seems like fatal flaws, down shadowed by excellent acting by all involved.

90,guerillagorilla,Low expectations + better than expected story = decent flick,6,12 January 2008,"Hybrid live-action + computer animated flicks have a quite spotty box office record. Tim Hill, the director of 2006's ""Garfield: Tale of Two Kitties"", knows this very well. That movie tanked domestically, just like the first ""Garfield"" did. The main culprit, of course, isn't the realistic looking blending of computer created characters in a live action world. It's downfall was a tepid, one-dimensional storyline pandering to only the pre-K audience.Hopefully, Hill has learned his lesson going forth from ""Alvin and the Chipmunks"". What we have here is definitely no savior of the retro-saturated market of anthropomorphized rodentia movies (""Ratatouille"" takes the gold for the most creative, fresh and cute rodent flick), but it's better than much of its competition.The trio of symphonic singing chipmunks, having been displaced from their natural home in a tree in a far-away forest, find themselves in the big city, having been transported in their downed tree to the lobby of a megalomaniacal music company. Seems their home is now a fresh Christmas tree. Knowing their new digs aren't friendly to little forest creatures a fraction the size of the next largest life form, they find refuge in the muffin basket of one Dave Seville, having been rebuked by his friend-turned-multimillionaire music exec, Ian. The pairing of these octave-gifted munks with this lonely, bumbling musician provides the backbone of the movie's plot.It's a relief to have been able to laugh along with the rest of the patronage, comprised mostly of pre-teens to freshly post-teens. Granted, I wasn't rolling in the aisles with them, a sign that I must be more critical (and yes, older) than they are. The innocent, brain-resting humor was impeded by a couple factors. Exactly how many potty & poop jokes do we need in a movie these days? By all accounts, we've been shown enough potty pranks to last us well beyond the current Writers Strike (and maybe until the 3d animation folks give the render farms a rest).The cast of actors seems a bit wooden, too. True, it's hard to be especially convincing when they are putting on a show in front of a bunch of void space, but I couldn't help but wonder during the first 10 minutes if a giant pin-up of Jason Lee would have been more dimensional than Jason Lee himself. Due credit goes to him though, for putting in a decent performance this side of Jon (Vacant) Arbuckle. David Cross stole the show, though, for his delightfully weaselly turn as the music exec seeing too many $'s in the Chipmunks.Overall, I'm surprised by how pleased I was when the end credits rolled. If Hollywood has taught me anything with this genre of movies, it's best to go in with very low expectations and be surprised by the lack of suckage put before me.""Alvin and the Chipmunks"" gets 6 of 10 stars.",Alvin and the Chipmunks
91,brettchatz,A huge disappointment for fans of this memorable series,5,31 December 2007,"There are films that inspire and there are miserable attempts of folly. Alvin and the Chipmunks falls into the latter category. Here was an 80's series that had it all: snappy beatz; great humour and fantastic stories. Take that perfect vision and translate it into a full-length feature film and your idea would look a little different than the gruel Tim Hill came up with. Perhaps he never saw the series? We have Dave, a lonely, bungling artist in a world that's hard on soft bachelors. One day he happens to meet a group of talking Chipmunks. It's that simple. These are no ordinary little animated characters however  they sing and they talk. So our intrepid musician writes their songs and gives them shelter. The Chipmunks are a huge hit  America loves them. But can Dave protect them from being exploited by ruthless, greedy men? I advise kids  and only very young kids  to see this with their parents. This is not a film worthy of being considered for adult or post-kindergarten entertainment.",Alvin and the Chipmunks
92,EarthwormJimFan,Harmless fun for a young audience.,6,13 January 2008,"I grew up watching the 80's version of the chipmunks, so when I first saw the trailer to this predictable but cute live-action update, I was somewhat happy. Although I knew that the humor would be targeted at a crowd under 10 years old, I still wanted to see it, especially since the 1980's animated film THE CHIPMUNK ADVENTURE is still one of my all-time favorite animated films.THE PROS: Well I went and saw it, and my expectations were met. It was more for younger kids, but it was throughly enjoyable. It was good to hear the Chipmunks sing their classic Christmas song, there were plenty of funny (but not hilarious) moments, and the Chipmunks themselves were well-animated and undeniably adorable (particularly Theodore).THE CONS: The story is predictable (although typical for most kid's films nowadays). Jason Lee is badly miscast as the Chipmunks' long-suffering songwriter and adopted father, David Seville. Also the ""romance"" between Dave and his neighbor is too clichéd. We don't need some sort of love story in every single film in my opinion.Overall, there is nothing brilliant about this film, but it's still fun. It ought to please young children and their parents.BOTTOM LINE: It's no Citizen Kane, but it's more fun than a Hula Hoop.",Alvin and the Chipmunks

It was born out of my utterly pure and totally nonbelligerent desire to point out the fact that you don't have to be in your prime state of development in life to enjoy a movie such as this. Oscar material? Would never even consider it. Excellent? Not even close. Has more dents and scratches then a car freshly plucked out of a demolition derby? Not quite. Do you have to be a raving Alvin and the chipmunks fanatic, who has seen every single episode, can't have any more collectibles with them unless you create them yourself, would marry any one of them if given the chance, in order to enjoy the movie? Not by a long shot... I can't really find word to describe the movie from the myriad of terms that come to mind, save one... good. I suppose that breaks things down easily enough for everybody to understand. And by everybody I mean the entire range of haters, lovers neutrals, people who lost the last shred of their tiny little soul while still in their mother's womb, others who are just jealous that other people have fun when watching this movie, and a great number of other categories as well. I, for one, believe that the only thing that can stop anyone from enjoying this movie in the least measure is their own way of thinking. If you've outgrown the childhood that may or may not have been influenced by such phenomenons as cartoons, you'll probably find this movie stupid, silly or simply outrageous. But... and this is a big BUT ladies and gentlemen, if you still hold that little spark in your soul that switches off an annoying part of your brain that makes you analyze things, then you will most likely kick back, enjoy the movie and savor your popcorn, fizzy drink and/or the laughter of the 5 year old sitting next to you. And as you look at that little boy or girl's face flushed from all that laughter, you might actually find it somewhere in your more or less frozen soul to laugh yourself once every now and then. If your versatility in the domain of cinema is virtually limitless and unmatched, and you have nothing against a silly, heart-warming comedy now and then, check out Alvin and the chipmunks. You'll like it. If you fall into any other of the categories mentioned above, or simply prefer a brain-twisting, heart-wrenching movie, over other kinds of stuff Hollywood throws at your fragile little brain/retinas, then don't waste your money. Use it to end hunger in Africa... it's more productive that way.",Alvin and the Chipmunks
94,Karlamon,Not as cute or funny as I expected,4,7 March 2011,"Alvin and the Chipmunks is another of those CGI/live-action family films based on a cartoon. This film did look cute and appealing, but beyond that, it had little to offer for me.The overall premise is about three singing chipmunks named Alvin (Justin Long), Simon (Matthew Gray Gubler) and Theodore (Jesse McCartney) who lose their tree home and are sent to Los Angeles, California. The three come upon a struggling songwriter named Dave (Jason Lee) who decides to hire them to sing his songs for him. It's cute at first but later becomes troublesome.Sadly, I couldn't really stick my teeth into this kids flick. It was dull and too predictable mainly because of its dry humor. The gags primarily consist handfuls of toilet jokes and destructive mayhem. It isn't such a bad thing for a children's film, but these gags are clichéd and recycled from other family movies that have already overused these techniques (i.e. farting, making a mess, breaking stuff, getting somebody fired from work). These predictable jokes were used a lot by Alvin and co which bored me and made me find the trio very annoying and unlikeable.Alvin and the Chipmunks is not a disaster, but it's forgettable for grownups alike. I was 16 when I first watched this on TV so maybe I was a bit too old for this stuff. I wouldn't recommend this as your sort of movie if you're over the age of 11, but it's strictly aimed for kids so they will surely enjoy it more. If you have some, give this a rental to keep them busy. ""C-""",Alvin and the Chipmunks
95,dmorrisbadger101,Good Ending!,7,18 September 2012,"PlotThe tree that the chipmunks Alvin (Justin Long), Simon (Matthew Gray Gubler), and Theodore (Jesse McCartney) live in is cut down and driven to Los Angeles. Once in L.A., the Chipmunks meet struggling songwriter David Seville (Jason Lee) who had his latest song rejected by JETT Records executive Ian Hawke (David Cross), his old college roommate. Dave also once had a relationship with his next door neighbor, Claire Wilson (Cameron Richardson). After winding up at Dave's interview, the Chipmunks hop into his basket and follow him home. Once at home, Dave discovers the Chipmunks, and is accidentally knocked unconscious. Upon waking, he kicks them out until hearing them sing ""Only You (And You Alone)"". Dave then makes a deal with them; they sing the songs he writes, and in exchange he provides food and shelter for them. However, all does not go well, as Dave's job presentation is ruined by their coloring on it, and when Alvin tries to set the mood for his dinner with Claire, things become weird and she rejects him after he tells her, ""My life is being sabotaged by talking chipmunks."" To make it up to Dave, the boys go to Ian in an attempt to record a song and get a record deal. Once the Chipmunks sing Dave's song to Ian, Ian signs them to the label and rehires Dave the next day. After a few singles, the Chipmunks become wildly popular. When Dave expresses concern for their well-being and insists that the Chipmunks are ""kids"" who don't need so much craziness in their lives, Ian convinces the Chipmunks that Dave is holding them back. After a misunderstanding with Dave, they go live with ""Uncle Ian"". They become enchanted with Ian at first, but once they set off on a coast-to-coast tour, Ian takes advantage of their naivete, changing their image and working them constantly. Meanwhile, Dave misses the chipmunks and he wishes they would come back home. He calls Ian to see if he can talk to them but Ian refuses, and then conceals Dave's motives from the boys. Later, the Chipmunks are wearing out, and it is all over the news. Dave, infuriated by what Ian has done to the three, decides to take matters into his own hands by infiltrating their concert. Just before the big concert, a doctor says that the Chipmunks are unable to sing due to exhaustion. Ian refuses to hand out refunds and advises the Chipmunks to lip sync. With Claire's help, Dave sneaks into the concert, but is grabbed by the security guards. When the Chipmunks see Dave being taken away, they realize that they've been tricked, decide that they have had enough of Ian, revealing that they were lip-syncing and ruin the concert. Ian catches them just when Dave is about to rescue them. He locks them up in a cage and prepares to take them to Paris. Dave tries to convince Ian to let the boys go but Ian refuses. Ian then leaves in his limo with the boys and Dave chases them but the boys have already escaped to Dave's car. Dave immediately pulls over and admits that he loves them like his own family. Meanwhile, Ian looks in the cage and is shocked to see the boys have replaced themselves with merchandising dolls. Sometime later, when the boys are fully accepted as part of the family, they invite Claire over for dinner again. Alvin accidentally creates a short circuit while having difficulty opening a bottle of champagne. Dave is trying not to say it, but the short circuit causes a blackout in the kitchen. Dave can hold it in no longer and says it, letting out his trademark yell ""ALLLLVINNN!!"", to which Alvin responds with ""Okay!"". In the film's epilogue, Ian (now unemployed) tries to make three squirrels sing, but fails.",Alvin and the Chipmunks
96,barca_AW,Good and entertaining movie for kids at Christmas,7,2 April 2015,"I don't understand the bad ratings of that movie. Maybe i can explain it from the point of a kid, which really likes this movie. I am now an 18 year old Man who is very interested in movies, so when Alvin and the chipmunks came in the theaters i was about 10 years old. And for me and my brother it was an adventure to see that movie. People often forget that there are movies who only exist to entertain kids and not the critical eyes of film interested man who only likes good films for example bird man and so on. This is a movie for kids which is very entertaining and also brings back the wonderful feeling of Christmas in that time. It also learns much about money and friends. I can say that the message of this movie is to stay on the ground and with your family and that you should not go there where the money is. After that movie i became a big fan of the chipmunks. I was surprised that it was that good, my brother and i also always listened to the songs of them. And thats what it about in this movie, its not interesting mystical or something, it is a wonderful entertaining film for kids and the film also contains some good messages.(Sorry for my bad English, i am Austrian)",Alvin and the Chipmunks

The acting is for children as well, so is it a Grammy Award Winner, NO, but, still a fun and loving story! My son is 4.5yrs old and he absolutely loved it!! He was laughing, and jumping around, and totally thrilled about the movie! It doesn't have to have superheros, and violence to be a good enjoyable film for kids to be interested in!

At the very least, you will not be disappointed! It was a lot of fun and worth seeing! I'd see a sequel if they had it, but as far as the cartoon is concerned, not interested.

""david seville sr."" can look down with pride at how his legacy is being handled by ""david seville jr."". hopefully, this film will be a great success, and result in a few more feature films on the adventures of these timeless characters.definitely a must see, and a DVD purchase, when released. great job one and all!!!",Alvin and the Chipmunks

I thought it was hysterical but my parents looked physically sick and like they were in pain.Now let's fast forward to 2018. I was babysitting my little cousin and she had this Dvd at her house, and she wanted to watch it. For a trip down memory lane, I decided to watch it with her.MY LORD WAS THIS MOVIE IMMATURE, ANNOYING, STUPID, AND DOWNRIGHT TERRIBLE.So the plot. Dave takes in stupid chipmunks that sing so he can make money. Because this is a really dumb kids movie, of course, he doesn't care about them at first but then he does. The chipmunks are so stupid. I hate Alvin, he's an annoying brat that ruins everything. Like when Dave had Claire over, he ruined their dinner, and then wonders why Dave hates him.Theodore is so stupid it annoys me. Simon is also just plain annoying. The humor is terrible.Like that scene where Simon ate Theodore's poop because he was trying to convince Dave it was a raisin.UM...WHY WOULD YOU PUT THAT IN A KIDS MOVIE? MY COUSIN LITERALLY LAUGHED AT THAT! YOU PEOPLE ARE JUST MAKING KIDS DUMBER.The only okay character was Uncle Ian, because he was kind of funny as a selfish guy who wants the chipmunks to make money for him.Don't watch this. Please.

But then, after noticing how financially successful its franchise has been, maybe I overrated to a desperate trailer (maybe the poop-eating only appears in the trailer).
But NOOO!! The poop-eating IS in the movie and still as unnecessary! 😫😫

I am giving 10/10 against all other votes to take this one least 0.01 up. The things I see in this animation,Chipmunk's actions, so cute, so impressionable. The characteristic of each of the chipmunks has been created very carefully, and it is consistence through out the film. The story shows us the real business world behind the music world.

106,claudia_lampl5,Brought back my love for the chipmunks,9,4 January 2008,"I was really skeptical about this movie. I said to myself ""I'm going to boycott this thing because of my childhood memories"". Born in the 80's I grew up with the old chipmunks cartoon which I watched every day. The funny thing is: the more I saw about this movie (trailers, pictures etc.) the more I began to research about the old cartoon. I couldn't remember too much about them and now I'm a big fan of the chipmunks again. I decided to give the movie a chance...and I'm glad I did. The movie itself was surprisingly entertaining. Not even the fart or the poop eat joke were too much in my opinion. I saw other children movies that did far worse. During the songs ""Witch Doctor"" and ""Christmas don't be late"" my friend and I began to sing while the child next to me stared at me with big eyes. We even stayed during the credits. Alvin, Simon and Theodore were great. At first I wasn't too happy that they were portrayed as real chipmunks and not some chipmunk mutants that walk on two feet but now I think this isn't too bad. I was surprised that not Alvin got the best (and funniest) parts but Simon (which was great since he was always my favorite chipmunk). I only have two (minor) problems with the movie (thus getting only 9 stars): First the story how they came to Dave. I love/d the original idea about them being a part of his family since they were babies because it has a more of family kind of feeling. Although they were chipmunks I always saw them as his sons in the cartoon. The second problem: Alvin without his cap. All in all a great movie with some ""Awwwww"" moments (Theodore getting kicked out of Ian's room), great music and funny moments. This movie was better than The Golden Compass in my opinion. Thanks to this movie I got my memories (and love) for the chipmunks back and more children learn about this cartoon in the future.",Alvin and the Chipmunks
107,Gar1195-1,I thought it was okay.,6,16 December 2007,"I thought this movie was okay. I mean, first, the beginning of the movie was funny. I loved the part where Dave kicked the three guys, then sent them back in after he heard them sing, but later, it has become a good vs. evil kind of thing. You have the good guys (Dave, the chipmunks) and you have the bad guy (Ian) and I like those good vs. Evil, like those good action movies for example. But, I thought the writing was poor,and it doesn't do as well of a job as the original animated version. It also has an okay cast, but the voices for the famous three are people I do not know or recognize. It was a nice movie, and the children might like it. But if you are a more mature person, this movie would not be your kind of movie. I liked the children comedy, but they sometimes give you hints on what is going to happen next. Like for example, when the chipmunks are captured by Ian, the camera is then focused to the real chipmunks, and the dolls. And I thought that the three are going to switch places with the dolls, and I was right. So, this movie was nice for children, but it wasn't for me.",Alvin and the Chipmunks
108,jake-584,OK the first time,6,7 July 2008,"""Alvin and the Chipmunks"" is the kind of movie that you love the first couple of times, but after that your opinion of it starts to go downhill. One thing that stuck out after the first two times was Jason Lee's terrible acting. There are some iffy moments in the script, but they would have slid by easier had there been an even slightly qualified actor playing Dave. He was stiff, unconvincing, and almost ruins the movie. The chipmunks, fortunately, are humorous and cute enough to carry the movie. The songs are fantastic as well, and I will most likely buy the soundtrack. The character Claire provides a unique love interest. She drops a few comments without breaking a sweat to Dave that left me going ""Oooh . . . burn."" Although ""Alvin and the Chipmunks"" gets tiring to me after a while, it will be loved by children who have never seen a movie about talking chipmunks.",Alvin and the Chipmunks

I have to admit that I like Jason Leee and he does a reasonable effort without being excessively silly. Ian played David Cross is a little over the top but this was acceptable to the adults and made it very easy for the youngest kids to understand. The animation of the Chipmunks was great, OK they did not look like real chipmunks but they did not look cartoonish like in Roger Rabbit.

But to be honest, Jason's performance was terrible, he got a lot of facial expressions but looked very unnatural, I know many people will say it's not easy to act with air or it's just a movie for kids, so don't be so serious on the comments. but he is an actor, whatever the movie is talking about, he need to do his job.

117,sfedulow,Alvin and the Chipmunks - Blu-ray Review from Hollywoodinhidef.com,8,7 April 2008,"Reviewed by James Plath, Managing Editor of DVDTOWN.COM and Contributor to HollywoodinHiDef.com Synopsis One name says it all, but who knew of Ross Bagdasarian, Sr. back in 1958, when ""The Chipmunk Song"" sold 4.5 million records in just seven weeks? Bagdasarian was better known as David Seville, and a high-tech tape recorder allowed him to do the voices for all three chipmunks as well as his own, and the musician's son revived the pop-novelty phenomenon in the Eighties, when it spawned an animated TV show. Now, this live-action and CGI film brings ""Alvin and the Chipmunks"" to a third generation. Forget what you've heard from cranky critics.This is a great family film, entertaining for the youngsters and fun for parents, and not just because it's an ""origin"" story that incorporates snippets of the old familiar songs. Sure, it's a giggle to see how Alvin, Theodore, and Simon end up bagged in a Christmas tree that's erected in the lobby of Jett Records--where Seville just happens to have been tossed out by his old college roommate and Jett honcho, Ian (David Cross). But it's also a hoot seeing Jason Lee duplicate the wide-eyed enthusiasm from his TV character on ""My Name is Earl,"" only with chipmunks to interact with instead of a slow-on-the-uptake brother.The plot is pretty standard. The chipmunks (voiced by Justin Long, Jesse McCartney and Matthew Gray Gubler) strike a deal with Dave to sing his songs in exchange for room and board, but then go with ""Uncle"" Ian after they're convinced Dave doesn't want the little troublemakers in his life anymore, only to have Ian turn into a regular Stromboli, working them until they're ragged (and until Dave can come to the rescue). Dave apparently has problems committing to a family, and so a side plot involves his ex- (Cameron Richardson). Though the Chipmunks go from Chip 'n' Dale clueless to hip-hop savvy faster that Alvin can get into trouble, how much logic do you want from a film that has talking and singing rodents? The CGI animation is excellent, the furballs are fun to watch, and there's only one poop joke and one fart gag, which is tame by today's standards. Kids will love it for the mischief, the singing, and the humor. And ultimately, the message (family first) is a good one.Video Quality Think primary colors, and lots of them, along with strong black levels that provide a nice 3-dimensionality, and not just for the CGI chipmunks. ""Alvin and the Chipmunks"" was transferred to a 25-gig disc using the AVC/MPEG-4 codec and presented in 1.85:1 aspect ratio, and it looks great in 1080p High Definition. The picture has a nice polished plasticine look to it, with strong edge detail.Audio Quality I'm a PCM fan, and so to my ears, while this DTS HD 5.1 Master Lossless Audio does a fine job of delivering a clear soundtrack with a nice balance and spread across the front speakers, it doesn't seem to have that extra ""pop"" that PCM often delivers. The rear speakers get involved during the Chipmunks' shenanigans and music, and particularly with the hip-hop numbers they really come to life. You lose a little fullness with the Spanish and French Dolby Digital 5.1, but both are still very serviceable soundtracks.Subtitles are in English (CC), Spanish, Cantonese, Mandarin, and Korean.Bonus Features For a box-office hit, ""Alvin and the Chipmunks"" comes with only TWO features, not counting a handful of other trailers. That's not even one per ""munk."" One of them gives us the history of David Seville and the Chipmunks, narrated by Bagdasarian, Jr.. It covers all the bases, and while it falls short of being what fans have come to think of as a full-blown documentary, with multiple talking heads, copious clips, and behind-the-scenes footage, it's still a nice feature. There are vintage stills, artwork from advertising and promotions, and a nice overall history. A second short feature on the music explains how Ali Dee and Co. didn't just want to make music for helium-voiced chipmunks; they wanted to make cool hip-hop and R&B tracks that would be worthy of a Top-10 song. It's interesting, but I would have liked to have had another feature on the CGI animation or a commentary track with Lee and the director. Why not? Tru-Blu? If you have a Blu-ray player and you have children, you already know that good HD titles for the whole family are tough to come by. Though there have been plenty of failures when it comes to live-action/CGI versions of a beloved cartoon classic, ""Alvin and the Chipmunks"" really does a nice job of appealing to nostalgic fans of the old music and cartoons, while also jazzing it up for a whole new crowd of admirers.",Alvin and the Chipmunks

Really, taking cartoons and turning them into real characters? How could that work? Well to say the least, they pulled it off. This movie was cute, entertaining, and funny. While it may have strayed a little from the originals, it still had that chipmunk flair that we know best. I am seventeen, and this movie was awesome. It had everyone in the theater, children, teenagers, and adults alike laughing the whole time. And when the credits rolled, there was applause, something I haven't heard at a movie theater in a long time. Even if you aren't a chipmunk fan, any kid will love it, and you probably will too.

Jesse McCartney? Justin long? i know you don't hear them, since their voices are sped up, but thats my point, why get actors like that if you're not even gonna hear them? anyone could've played the chipmunks, as long as they got their voices sped up. that was a rant. anyway7/10",Alvin and the Chipmunks

This well directed thriller should of been more successful in box office. Another thing that surprises me is that the film didn't win Best Picture in fact the film didn't even go nominated. The films screenplay and dialogue is also amazing it should of won an Oscar for the screenplay. I still can't get over the fact of how great this movie is.

Congratulations for this great movie and I hope part 2 will be released!10 of 10 and it's a ""MUST SEE""",Alvin and the Chipmunks

124,Ilikemostmovies,kids loved it,8,12 April 2008,"The kids loved it. It was a little difficult for me to sit through the entire movie but I wasn't there for me. The acting of Jason Lee and David Cross was difficult to watch but the chipmunks' acting was good. We saw the movie at a second run theater where they show movies just about to go onto DVD. After spending $50.00 on tickets and refreshments and two hours I can't get back, the kids asked if we could pick up the DVD on the way home. I could have saved $30.00 and could have done something that I wanted to do while they watched it on DVD. My kids have the DVD now and watch it all the time. Good for the kids, barely tolerable for the parent. I give it an eight as an average. The kids give it a 10, of course, and I give it a 2. The two is for the chipmunks. They are very cute. I find that the more annoying a show is, the more the kids like it. It's what happens as I get older.",Alvin and the Chipmunks
125,jwilsoncritic,Some things don't need to be made into movies,4,28 August 2021,"Alvin and the chipmunks are household names, and their animated TV series was a huge hit for years, entertaining children across the globe.If it had stayed that way, there would be no issue. However, Hollywood's obsession with forcing well known franchises into the 90 minute films has struck again, with this feeling like a glorified, live action episode of the tv show, except this is three times as long.To be fair, the special effects still hold up even now, and considering the $60,000,000 budget, that's not much of an achievement.If you have young children, they'll probably be able to squeeze some joy out of this, but if you are over the age of 7, be prepared to turn the channel..",Alvin and the Chipmunks
126,a-joel624,Cant believe it was this good,9,19 January 2008,"OK, saw it 1st week it came out, then saw it over the winter break holy c*** was it good, i mean for a kid my age(15) i probably would have said OK this movie is a kiddie movie lets go see i am legend, NOPE!!!!! this movie was casted perfectly, and the chipmunks so cute!!!!, only thing was Jason lee do not get me wrong he was good, but only thing was is that he was not aggressive with Alvin, when i say that i mean the typical quote ""Alvin, Alvin, Alvin!!!!!!!!"" was not the best i have heard, then again he only said it once o well. Great movie, love the singing, By far beat I AM LEGEND only in my opioun. THank you Good night9 out of 10 mo-f******",Alvin and the Chipmunks
127,colby_schmidt7-2,A Great Movie finally,10,14 December 2007,hey OK first off i grew up watching the cartoon and when i heard about the movie i thought hey they'd probably ruin it well i went to the theater tonight and the movie was sold out i got the last ticket. got in there and boy was i shocked it was a great movie for any age group i'm 18 and i loved it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!Its got a great story to it and its real funny at parts and the best part for parents is there is no swearing at all so take your kids to see this movie trust me you want be disappointed.Especially if your a fan of the old show and all the old music like i am lol well i'm gonna get off of here see ya'll later peace.,Alvin and the Chipmunks
128,lankymania,It's About Time!,10,16 December 2007,"Fans flocked to see The Dukes Of Hazzard made into Jackass: The Southern Years. Next is CHiPs, so I hear with Fez from That 70's Show. And Knight Rider is the next one on the chopping block. So with Charlie's Angels ushering in the age of killing great concepts, I was a little skeptical going to see how Hollywood would kill three singing chipmunks. I was dead wrong. Alvin and the Chipmunks ROCKED! Making a conscious effort to keep the spirit of the characters intact, the film does not stray from the simple heart that made the concept popular 50 years ago. They were cute, sure, but were like actual children, which made the story oddly believable. And bringing in David Cross was genius, pimping out a good idea for money and mass appeal (The Chipmunks). It casually knocked the idea of killing a great concept for money. Brilliant! This film actually did something quite unique nowadays...it respected the franchise and the fans who grew up with it.",Alvin and the Chipmunks
129,janetta_fambrough,"Good, Clean, Family fun",10,20 January 2008,"If you would like to see a good, clean, fun movie, that you don't have to cover your kids' eyes or ears to avoid ""over-education"" then I highly recommend this movie. I completely loved this movie!!! It was adorable and funny at the same time. I fell in love with Alvin, Simon, and Theodore, all over again after watching this movie. I watched the cartoon series all of the time when I was a kid and always felt they could do more with it. I am so glad they made this movie for the next generation so they can enjoy the chipmunks as much as my friends and I did growing up. Just one more suggestion, wait until it comes out on video to watch it. I'm sure it would be much more fun to watch sitting on the couch in pajamas than in a crowded movie theater.",Alvin and the Chipmunks
130,snax7629,Loved it (and I'm a teen),9,8 February 2008,"I loved this movie for a multitude of reasons. First reason was that Jason Lee was perfect for this role. I know some may not agree with, this but for some reason this role seems perfect (favorite line: ""Ah, this is trippy""). And, hey, he was a heck of a lot better than the actor from Garfield.But the best part about the movie is what happens when you actually listen to the songs that the Chipmunks are singing. Some of them are ridiculously funny when you realize that they are singing about getting girls (The song 'witch doctor' in particular). The lyrics are all fine for all ages so don't worry about that parents, but still the adults will be surprised to hear about the tiny animals singing about having an Escalade.It did stray into predictable territory for the final moments, particularly when Dave finishes the movie in the same manor he always has finished the movies/cartoons (spoiler ahead) by shouting out Alvin's name. It was too stereotypical for me, but it was required as a tribute to the cartoon series. However this didn't affect the film at all.If you're childish, or like watching little animals sing songs, then this is for you.",Alvin and the Chipmunks
131,kda_h,I liked the movie,9,5 April 2008,"You know I have to disagree with the comments on here. I really liked the movie. My children like it and I think Jason Lee did a really good job in the movie. He is believable and does his job well. I don't believe the typecast part. I don't think that John Travolta would have been good in the movie. You needed someone goofier. Bill Murray is to old for this part.Every family movie has the main characters getting together but that is OK. Kids need to see that there is a happy ending to the stories.The movie brought back really good memories and some updated songs. I found it really enjoyed it and there were some great funny spots like The fart move, and the coffee scene.It is a kids movie and as long as you watch it with that in mind I think you will find it enjoyable.",Alvin and the Chipmunks
132,beckham_d81,This is a really great movie of this kind.,10,6 September 2008,"First thing first! The IMDb movie rate is unacceptable. This rate is clearly show the way our people judge the movies. This is a really a great movie, I would say. Why? Just look the chipmunks? Their actions. Are those like stupid Garfield movies? Common people, what the nonsense are you taking. This movie can't compare with stupid Garfield and other movies which has 3 d animation interacted with human. I know the story line doesn't have much content. But this is an entertain movie with CG effects. Look the each character (chipmunk) , how nicely they are performed? I watched this movie several times. Each chipmunk has his own behavior. This uniqueness is protected throughout the movie. You can't compare this movie with old chipmunk's cartoons. That is not fair at all. I really don't like that old carton series. But this movie makes me like chipmunks. The staring song is marvellous! Again, please watch this movie with open heart and vote sincerely. This movie can be enjoy for any age. 10/10 from me.",Alvin and the Chipmunks

134,perbaby2,Good for Kids,8,19 December 2007,"My boyfriend and I went to see this yesterday, because, let's face it- who doesn't love the Chipmunks? The movie was adorable and definitely good for kids. The one disappointing thing for me was the lack of their songs...the only one they kept was the Christmas Chipmunk song- if you don't count the remix of ""Witch Doctor""(there was a Chipmunk Dace CD with it on there..but that version was closer to the original). And the ending could have been a little bit better/had more closure. It was a decent ending- don't get me wrong. But I think it could have done better...I know I was left thinking ""uh..is there more?""Overall, great film, highly recommend for taking kids or kids at heart to see it.",Alvin and the Chipmunks
135,alicelynn,Adorable Chipmunks!,10,29 December 2007,"This movie has a average user rating of 5.7? C'Mon!! Its funny and those Chipmunks, especially Theodore really tug at your heart strings. I think that little voice could melt the coldest of hearts. Its a great movie to take young children too because there's nothing to be concerned about them viewing. You just gotta love those Chipmunks hoarding their food, coloring and getting sucked up in the vacuum. Its the ultimate feel good movie that sends the right messages. Made me want to go home and eat some toaster waffles! Check out the official website for a description of each of the Chipmunks and some other cool stuff.",Alvin and the Chipmunks
136,uksims,Heart Felt and Funny,7,26 January 2008,"I think this movie was had some funny moments in it (Don't ch wish your girlfriend was hot like me- LOL) and very funny. I saw it with my little sister the other day in cinema and we both thought it was great! PROS- The chipmunks were so cute and looked so real (Theodore was adorable)and the storyline was really good.There was a lot of Heart in this movie and some bits almost made me cry. The songs were great (especially Witch Doctor) Great acting as well.CONS- Jason Lee could have been better as Dave and I don't think there was need for a romance storyline.All on all, The movie was great and if you are thinking of a movie that will be funny and heartwarming at the sametime- This is the movie to watch! Your kids will love it!",Alvin and the Chipmunks
137,japresley-2,Alvin and the Chipmunks Brought Back Memories For Me,10,16 December 2007,"Hello There AATC Fans!!! 50 years ago when Mr. Ross Bagdasarian Sr. created three little chipmunks, he created a phenomenon. I was born in 1981, so I remember them back 20 years ago. He has done a remarkable and fantastic job in creating these little guys. Jason Lee's portrayal as Dave Seville was just outstanding!!! I've read a lot of comments about the crude jokes and the somewhat sad moments when Dave thought about giving up. Alvin, Simon and Theodore aren't all about crude humor, they're all about recreating a tone that was first heard of in 1958 and again in 1980. in 2007, they were introduced as icons and showed the world that after 50 to 20 years of being exiled, they are back, and better than ever. Parents, PLEASE TAKE YOUR CHILDREN TO SEE THIS WONDERFUL FAMILY FILM!!!! I've heard people say, they don't look the same, well I've got news for those people, in 1985, I was a little kid, always looked little even at 8 years old, now I'm 26, I don't look 8, but I still get people not believing me when I tell them I'm that old. The same goes for Alvin, Simon and Theodore, yes, they didn't look boyish, they looked like real chipmunks, but it's still them. Another complaint, is the Chipettes. They were not in this movie, and people were flipping out saying, ""Where's the Chipette's""!!!! Well, just like I said about the Chipmunks, the Chipettes are still in a vault somewhere, somewhere in exile. But if us moviegoers can spend our money and see the Alvin and the Chipmunks movie over and over and buy it on DVD, then a sequel will be in the works and the Chipettes will return along with Alvin and the Chipmunks. Ross Bagdasarian Jr. and Janice Karman have done a brilliant job in bringing back those little guys. Mr. Bagdasarian Sr. would be proud of his son and would be thrilled to see all of us marvel at his 50 year creation. It's a must-see and must-have. It's a Christmas treat for all who enjoy laughter and entertainment. Enjoy The Movie and Enjoy The Holidays!!! THANK U!!!!",Alvin and the Chipmunks

139,dramaqueenc1023,Surprisingly... bad.,2,26 December 2007,"I went into this movie with semi-high expectations after loving the cartoon series in my childhood, and this nearly wrecked that love for me. Jason Lee, David Seville in the film, is horrifying. I understand it can't be easy to act with CGI characters who aren't actually there, but I really found his performance atrocious, along with all the other non-animated characters. The chipmunks were adorable, yet sometimes blatantly obvious at moving the plot of the story along, and therefore did not tempt me to stay in the theater for longer than half an hour into the film. If you feel you must see this film, rent it, at the most. It is NOT worth eight bucks to see it in theaters, unless you'd like a good laugh at the horrible acting.",Alvin and the Chipmunks

142,siddhis00,wow,5,20 May 2008,"The chipmunks are adorable, but does anyone know when this ridiculous ghetto phase is going to end? Directors need to stop ruining old songs. The 'Witch Doctor' song was fine the old way, not in ghetto style!!! If you liked the chipmunks from the 80's, don't watch this movie. To movie makers: Leave the good things alone!!! Jason Lee is a great actor, but I didn't see any similarity between him and the original Dave Seville. I'm sure kids will enjoy the chipmunks because they are pretty funny and the movie has it's good moments. But if you're looking for the REAL chipmunks, you'll enjoy The Chipmunks Adventure a lot better. It doesn't look like an Usher video.",Alvin and the Chipmunks
143,OlderSam,5.7..? Absolutely UNFAIR,10,12 February 2008,"First, I watched this movie with my little kids, and then I watched it again alone. My god, it's one hell of a movie, I just can't believe how UNFAIR the voting is.... 5.7? Everything in this movie is just perfect, the animation of the chipmunks, the acting, the story, the joy, and most of all; the way some lines makes you LOL. OK, so far, the total gross of this movie is more than $ 250,000,000 only US and UK which means contradiction, 5.7 and making $ 250,000,000. Just can't get it. Jason Lee was very funny, I'm trying to think of some other actor who would have done better than him... I couldn't find any; he was the only actor for this character. David Cross was the only bad choice; I wish John Travolta had that role.",Alvin and the Chipmunks
144,beachhottie570,what i thought,10,15 December 2007,i love this movie! it was an awesome tale of the chipmunks. i took my brother and sister too see it. even tough they were too young to remember the old chipmunks cartoon on TV i wasn't. it was great and i recommend this to kids and adults. its funny and great. and it wont be a money waste. if you loved the old chipmunks cartoons you'll love the movie<333 10 out of 10 or 5 gold stars it was a cute remake of the talking chipmunks and Alvin Simon and theodore<3 there still in the business the only thing missing was the chipettes. but it was perfect the way it was and i wouldn't change it for the world<3 the movie was too good to be true a number one hit!,Alvin and the Chipmunks
145,sharmainechan,A show worth watching as a family.,9,16 December 2007,"Though I've never seen or heard of Alvin and The Chipmunks, I did know they had a hit single called 'The Christmas Song'. And since this show came along, I decided to watch it. This show did have a moral at the end. It was to in the end, understand that parents do things for your own good and because they love you. They wouldn't spoil you and lavish you with gifts if they knew what was right for you. I myself am a teenager and I loved the show. I enjoyed how hilarious it was, and how adorable those chipmunks were. It really gave me a good laugh and I enjoyed it.If you think Alvin and the Chipmunks is like Garfield, it definitely isn't and never will be. This movie was really interesting to watch.This show, I believe, has captured the hearts of people who love animals & will continue to capture the many hearts around the world.",Alvin and the Chipmunks
146,ryanbryant,It's actually really good!,9,12 December 2007,"I went into this movie expecting to see something close to GARFIELD (which was a terrible film), but ALVIN AND THE CHIPMUNKS is actually really good! I know. It sounds crazy. Especially coming from a 30 year old. I think Jason Lee is the weakest part of the film. He is funny in some scenes but lame in others. But David Cross is good in every scene he's in. And the movie as a whole is great. It's very funny. And surprisingly emotional. This one is going to go up there with recent comedies with great characters. The story is the perfect one for the remake of the 80s TV show I liked as a kid. It's the origin story about how this guy, David Seville (struggling songwriter, disorganized guy) came to adopt 3 singing chipmunks. David Cross is the music executive who keeps shooting Dave (and his crappy songs) down. Dave has just gotten out of a relationship with a cute girl (don't remember her name, but this plot was totally unnecessary -- the movie's biggest flaw is that it tries to jam in a romance between Dave and this girl, when the real romance of the movie is between Dave and the chipmunks). Dave realizes these talking chipmunks can sing, and that launches the career of the strangest music act ever seen to man. But I'll say it again, the movie is very, very funny. I recommend it to families and even to single people like me who enjoy comedies.",Alvin and the Chipmunks
147,musique33,"Take Your Kids, They'll Love It!",8,14 December 2007,"Took my munchkin to see Alvin & The Chipmunks today. Though Jason Lee is boring and David Cross is way over the top, the Chipmunks themselves are awesome. Alvin, voiced by Justin Long AKA the ""Mac"" guy is great! He wasn't as recognizable as Simon, voiced by Matthew Gray Gubler AKA Dr. Spencer Reed from Criminal Minds, who has most of the best lines in the movie. Rounding out the cast is teen popster Jesse McCartney as an adorable Theodore. For those who watched the cartoons as kids, this movie is great nostalgia and definitely how you would have imagined the Chipmunks come to life. The music is pretty cheese, but I still would recommend the movie for anyone who has young kids. The first two shows we attempted to go to sold out while we were in line, so we waited two hours just to see the movie, and weren't disappointed. I wouldn't say this is a must see in the theater, but I would definitely catch it again when it comes out on DVD. The movie attempted an underlying theme of the dangers of fame and it's effect on children, which I thought was interesting given all the child star dramas being played out in the media today. I think they meant it to be a subliminal gift wrapped warning for children to not try to grow up so fast and to listen to their parents because they know what's best for them. I don't know if any of that message will really sink in, but at least the kids will be entertained.",Alvin and the Chipmunks
148,jessica_christians,one of the best movies I have ever seen!!!,10,17 December 2007,"This movie is one of the best movies I have ever seen! It was so enjoyable and so cute. It was also really funny. Jason Lee was so great for the part of Dave, it was hilarious! I gotta say though, right when to move opened and ""Bad Day"" was sung by the Chipmunks, I just laughed so hard it was so cute! If there is a sequel I will definitely go and see it. Right now, I want to get the deluxe edition 2-disc set (if there is one) when it comes out and the soundtrack. They have to make another one! I'm going to go to this movie again with friends and my family. This was definitely a highlight of my year! I'm seeing a lot of comments and reviews about this movie about it being ""bad."" I don't see what the problem is! So what if they aren't exactly like the cartoons that we've grown up loving. It's the 21st century! It's gonna look new! It's gonna be different! I must say, the movie was awesome the way it was created. It was very well written and the acting was off the charts!",Alvin and the Chipmunks
149,alloycat,"Kick back and just enjoy, it's so worth it.",10,24 December 2007,"I can't find one bad thing to say about this movie. I grew up with the Chipmunks, and found the film to be funny, light-hearted, and a great re-vamping of some of my favorite characters. The music was masterfully chosen, and the actors very well cast.Jason Lee fits quite well in the role of Dave Seville, and the voice cast for the boys was spectacular. I never would have guessed that the boys voices weren't done by Ross Jr.If you grew up loving these guys, you'll love 'em more.

150,frcate76,Great movie day with my students,7,31 December 2007,"I'm a middle school teacher and went with my students to see ""Alvin and the Chipmunks"" during the week before we got out of school for the holiday vacation. I'm very thankful for an enjoyable family movie this time of the year, that is provides this much fun for both the students and the adults going with them. I grew up with Alvin and the Chipmunks and I felt like this movie was very well done. When you take a group of middle school students and have all positive response, that's not bad at all. I wouldn't mind sharing this movie with any company that I might have over the holiday and that's what I'm looking for, especially during the holidays. Very well done!While I might be interested in a movie with more of a plot if I were watching by myself, there are movies that I enjoy that are not appropriate for me to share with students. For one thing, 6th graders don't have the life experience to understand some of the movies that even my older students understand.",Alvin and the Chipmunks
151,cschuft,disappointing,1,2 January 2008,"I'm surprised to read all the positive comments on this movie. Even my 4 and 6 year old were bored. The chipmunks are cute...but the storyline is overly obvious. Not recommended for young ones with the least sophisticated tastes.We did hear a few laughs from the audience while we were in attendance; but I wondered why.I don't admit to ever being a 'chipmunks' fan, but I expected to be entertained. It's not even an 'escapist' movie as far as I can tell. Simply a heavy handed view of 'success too young spoils'. We've seen more than enough of that with Britney Spears, et al, haven't we?Don't bother.",Alvin and the Chipmunks
152,donnan-4,great for all ages,10,13 January 2008,"I took my 4 year old grandson to see this movie and he laughed all the way through it. I don't know when I enjoyed a movie so much. The chipmunks were cute as can be, and so lovable. I also am a great fan of Jason Lee and never miss his ""Earl"" show. The songs brought back fond memories from when the chipmunks first were introduced to the world. This movie made them seem alive and just as mischievous as in all their past records. It is great to have characters that can be shared across generations. It was good to relax and watch a movie with no sex and violence and especially no vulgar language. What a great way to spend a Sunday afternoon. I can't wait for it to come out on video!!",Alvin and the Chipmunks
153,kingsambassador,Can't get enough of the 'munks,7,14 January 2008,"A big surprise of this film is that it does nearly everything just right. Good story (just what is needed and nothing more), great casting, and a wealth of fun, catchy chipmunk tunes. ""Alvin and the Chipmunks"" engages adult audiences as well as the kids who just can't get enough of those squeaky voices.The film separates itself from other kid movies through its 'intangibles'...simple things from the choice of Dave's home (with the clever address of '1958', the year which started it all) to the facetious opening scene with the three chipmunks ""angering a tree"" after they ""had a bad day"".Jason Lee is an outstanding casting choice for Dave Seville, the original Chipmunks guardian/songwriter (and stage-persona of Ross Bagdasarian himself). As Dave, Lee keeps a plausible rapport with the chipmunks, reminiscent of Joel's rapport with the machine creatures of ""Mystery Science Theater 3000"", only with the added ability to warm to the chipmunks' charm as a reluctant father might.""Chipmunks"" sticks to the ageless themes of the importance of heeding one's parents and of doing what's wise rather than just what feels good at the time. Dave and his Music Producer Ian Hawke (David Cross) both battle for the chipmunks' attention as symbols of good and bad, respectively.Another big plus for the film are the chipmunks themselves. Alvin, Simon, and Theodore are given greater character distinction and development in this film than in any other Chipmunks production. The CGI art was balanced enough to convey their moods & expressions but without pervading too much of the rest of the real-world movie.The only disappointments were the inevitable ABC (Annoying, Base, Cliché) kid-movie shticks (e.g., rear end/wedgie references, gas moments, etc.), of which the film has a few early infractions but nothing quite able to dispel the chipmunks' puerile charms or to send adults walking out with rolling eyes.Outweighing this are the fun, pathos, and music of a classic trio reborn. All in all, young and old alike will all come out wanting talking chipmunk friends of their own.",Alvin and the Chipmunks
154,Putangpi3,It was surprisingly good,7,17 January 2008,"Surprising as this may sound to most of you reading this, the movie was actually quite enjoyable, much to my surprise. I thought for sure I would be driven insane by those three abnormal voices, but I wasn't. Jason Lee performed pretty well, considering his 3 co-stars were computer generated. David Cross was hilarious in his part as ""Uncle Ian"" and had a few moments were I genuinely laughed out loud. The movie itself is pretty funny, I thought it would be a tacky movie aimed at the 5-10 year old age bracket, but after seeing it myself, I would place it in the any age bracket. As you can see these most common misconceptions that I share with most of you (Most probably) were proved wrong. If you have a bit of spare time, I suggest encourage you to go along and see it. I enjoyed it, and I would definitely watch it again. Full credit to Tim Hill for directing such a good movie, Two thumbs from me.",Alvin and the Chipmunks

Which was awesome .. Mama don't let your baby grow up to be cowboy, CHIPMUNKS..... ALVINNNNN!!! After that this site has asked me to elaborate on my feeling's fine (it's my first post here so rookie mistake) I believe that the exclusion of that particular album was a attack country music in general. And at this point they want ten line's of text fine. It is only a movie about chipmunks with Jason Lee, who happen's to be a way better actor then what ever he was asked to do in this sub par for his standard movie. At this point it's pointless for me to ramble on about it . I tried for ten line's I think I have it .",Alvin and the Chipmunks
157,iamnotfake,Good Movie,10,2 February 2010,"The film is about three chipmunks who can talk and I think it's very good movie. It is a funny movie, squirrels are amusing and clumsy. They messes always and it's fun to look on them. Dave as they live with is always angry and screaming Alvin when Alvin, Theodor and Simon have messed the house and I think it's funny. Now, it has also been a Alvin and the Chipmunks 2.There are good songs in both films but better songs in Alvin and the Chipmunks 2 I think. They are famous all over the world because they are good singers. They have smurf voice and that's right fun. The song I most remember from the first film, Bad Day.The film is for all ages, it's a family film. But I think there are more girls who are watching this movie. But the film is well more a child movie. But I think we older people make jokes in the movie better than what they do younger. It is fun to watch if you have the way several times. For when we make jokes better.",Alvin and the Chipmunks
158,bumblebritches57,"Jason Lee RUINED the movie, and it's sequels.",1,14 October 2012,"The movie was terrible, I LOVED Alvin and the Chipmunks when I was little, I even sang along constantly to their music, and I was excited to hear that a movie was coming out, but Jason Lee RUINED this movie, he's SO god damn grating it's literally unbearable to watch. his ""Alvinnnnnnnnnn!"" scream is terrible, his acting is terrible (Literally the worst I've ever seen, Megan Fox is light-years ahead of this douche-bag) the only good *anything* he's ever been in, was My Name is Earl, and that's because he's ""playing"" a white trash character, and given his acting chops, I wouldn't be surprised at all to find out he is actually white trash. there is nothing redeemable about his ""performance"" and the sad part is, the rest of the movie isn't too bad, not great, but I'd give the non Jason Lee parts a 5.5-6. Hopefully Universal will reboot this franchise and actually find a good male lead, and do away with all the cheesiness, and ""we're-gonna-pander-the-movie-to-three-year-olds-because-they- don't-know-what-a-decent-movie-is"".",Alvin and the Chipmunks
159,celina_sowadska91,"Great for younger audiences, however, it was torture for anyone over the age of 13.",5,3 January 2008,"I'll admit, the chipmunks were cute, and yes the visual effects, and voice manipulation was something to compliment, however, the main actor (Jason Lee), killed any hope (for me at least) of enjoying this movie to the fullest. He was just so hopelessly dull and one dimensional that after about 15 minutes, the cute factor of the chipmunks could no longer satiate my want of solid acting. However, you're hearing this from a 17 year old who went (on free will, I'll admit) to see it with a 9 year, who when I asked what she thought of the movie, said it was 'great!'. I went, just like the rest of moviegoers, due to a brilliant marketing campaign, that was greatly helped by the cuteness, and familiarity of 'Alvin and the Chipmunks' for the older audiences (maybe even the parents, who remember the cartoon version). Come on, who wouldn't want to see a parody of 'Bad Day', the most annoyingly over played song of last year? So I'm confounded as to what to rate this movie. Put simply, kids will love it, the parents might want to fall asleep, and call it day (they will however have to put on a smile when it finishes). I was sitting at the far right of the movie theatre, and thought to myself on several occasions how nice it was that I had a wall to rest my head on, so that I could go to sleep. Anyone's attention span that might get bored of chipmunks, I forewarn you, the acting will NOT be something to lean on; you will have to find the chipmunks amusing, sorry.",Alvin and the Chipmunks
160,rachelabourque,Great Kids Movie,7,17 December 2007,"I brought my 8, 6 and 5 year old to this movie and they left entertained and happy! Although adults might loose interest after the initial introduction of Dave to the Chipmunks, the story was kept simple enough to keep the kids interest. There was some humor that all of us could share and appreciate. Given that the Chipmunks were not only talking Chipmunks, any parent of small children could appreciate Dave's trouble with them.The use of popular music was wise and my 8 year old was excited to know the songs. We actually have bought the sound track for long car rides.I did loose interest about 3/4 of the way through and was hoping the story would wrap up. There were numerous missed opportunities for more adult comedy that could have been slipped in.Overall, cute kids movie and the adults got some chuckles out of it as well! Worth seeing for a Sunday matinée.",Alvin and the Chipmunks
161,kscollins-53296,The cold hands of society ideals entrance me more than this movie,3,20 June 2015,"This movie made me consider immigrating to North Korea, just to be away from this atrocity. Even a one way trip to Mars is better. I'd rather give birth to a live elephant. I'd rather rip my fingernails off. I'd rather eat at Taco Bell. This movie is like how bile tastes. There's also nudity, and it is a one way track to sin. Our economy is plummeting and this is how the government repays us. The cold hands of capitalism have me in a vice I can not escape. One day the death of society with come for us all, in the form of horrendous high notes and outdated clichés. This movie is a dark abyss, and I'm tired to the lies.",Alvin and the Chipmunks
162,falneeg,goofs galore,9,27 December 2007,"It is Christmas time in Hollywood. Dave looks at the clock-it says 6:30, it is still very light outside. I don't know about Los Angeles, but where I live in California, it is dark by 5:00 pm. Other than that, (one of the very obvious goofs), it was a fun and cute movie. I was 5 when they began and I think I knew all the words to all the songs and re-enjoyed the show when my son was little some 27 yrs later. We need more of these feel good, fun and a lack of sexual content movies. Just because we are adults does not mean that is all we care to see when we lay down our $10.00 for a ticket. Not every adult going to see a ""G"" or ""PG"" movie has children in tow.",Alvin and the Chipmunks
163,asb-78749,Alvin and the Chipmunks,9,10 April 2017,"-Title: Alvin and the chipmunks -Genre: Animation -Story: This movie is about the chipmunk's band -Interesting point: musicI usually likes chipmunks. The main characters of this movie is three small chipmunks. So I think this movie is one of the cutest movie. They are different from other chipmunks for the following two points. First, they can speak English. They are good at speaking English than me.. Second, they can sing very well. Their music is so good. I like their music. For this reason, I recommend this movie. I want to recommend this to kids and tired friends. If I have enough time, I will watch this movie again. I hope you watch this movie too.",Alvin and the Chipmunks
