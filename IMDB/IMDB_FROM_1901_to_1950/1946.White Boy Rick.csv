0,bkoganbing,"""This is Detroit, you either are on the take, or you get taken""",6,2 January 2019,"In looking up this film to write this review, I noted that a documentary film was
released the year before with the real Richie Wershawe, Jr. and others telling this
story. I will be looking that up to see if there are significant differences.This is a tale worth telling and it's quite an indictment of Detroit and its governance as well as the war on drugs. Sad though that it moves at such a
baby snail pace.Young Richie Merritt does what he has to to survive as does his blue collar
father Matthew McConaughey with factories closing all over the Detroit area
and suburbs. McConaughey makes a living selling guns out of his car, transporting them from other states with less restrictions and Merritt helps
out.Both the FBI and the Detroit police narcotics unit spot this kid who is only in
his mid teens when the story starts. Jennifer Jason Leigh and Rory Cochrane
are the FBI and Brian Tyree Henry is the Detroit PD. Young Merritt is recruited
to be an informer and he gets involved with some of the drug gangs. Known
to one and all as White Boy Rick.The best part of the film are the Wershawe family scenes especially with
McConaughey and Merritt. I think Merritt was under too much directorial
restraint in his performance. Outstanding is Bel Powley as Merritt's crack
addicted sister. Veterans Bruce Dern and Piper Laurie I only wish had more
time as the grandparents. In fact Dern pronounces a heartfelt verdict in the
end on a law enforcement system that used and abandoned Merritt.It's a good film White Boy Rick, sad it falls considerably short of greatness.",White Boy Rick
1,SnoopyStyle,White Boy Idiot,6,25 August 2019,It's 1984. 14 year old high school dropout Rick Wershe Jr. (Richie Merritt) joins his gunrunning father (Matthew McConaughey) in a gun buying trip and transporting them into Detroit. His mother left the family long ago. His sister Dawn (Bel Powley) leaves with her boyfriend falling into drug addiction. He sells AKs with silencers to his best friend Boo's crime family. He's given the nickname White Boy Rick and brought into the drug world with its corrupt cops and corrupt politicians. FBI Agents Snyder (Jennifer Jason Leigh) and Byrd (Rory Cochrane) with DPD Narcotics Detective Jackson recruit Rick and starts him off into dealing crack.This boy is an idiot which is sorta interesting and sorta infuriating. It does not engender any sympathy or rooting interest. Having newcomer Merritt be the lead has a reality to the movie but he is not the movie star type. He does look rough and older than the character's age. It could have been a comedic character but Merritt is not that capable. The Star of David is really hilarious. The other issue is the attempt in the closing moments to gain sympathy for his plight. There is no sympathy to be had for his idiocy. He's lucky that he didn't get killed in prison. It's never clear why he would work for the FBI other than being a teenage idiot. This story is actually quite interesting. It could have tried for some better comedy. It could have heighten the tension. It's an interesting movie with some limiting flaws.,White Boy Rick
2,boblipton,Annoying,5,15 July 2020,"If you've heard mention of this movie, you'd think it's about how a fifteen-year-old Richie Merritt played police, FBI and the Black drug king pins of of Detroit.What goes up on the screen is a movie about stupid, uncaring people in a stupid, uncaring environment who get played by stupid, uncaring FBI agents, think they're smarter than everyone else and discover that no one cares what happens to them, just like it says at the beginning.At the end, we're supposed to care about this guy, because he never pulled a trigger, just sold them drugs and guns, and those who did are dead or paroled. Isn't that unfair? It makes me want to echo abbot Arnaud Amalric: ""Novit enim Dominus qui sunt eius.""",White Boy Rick
3,Prismark10,White Boy Rick,5,18 October 2019,"White Boy Rick is based on true facts. What should had been a thoughtful drama turns into a gloomy and an interminable bore.Set in mid 1980s Detroit, a city rife with violence and drugs. Rick Wershe Sr (Matthew McConaughey) buys cheap guns, modifies them and sells them on. He is looking for the Golden Fleeced to give his kids a better life. It might be too late, his daughter is already addicted to crack.Teenage son Ricky Wershe Jr (Richie Merritt) gets into into drug dealing and informing for the FBI about rival black drug gangs, one of which he has managed to infiltrate. The film has a narrative that law enforcement coerced Ricky Jr into selling drugs and then betrayed him. When Ricky is later arrested, he was given a life jail term with no chance of parole because of Michigan's then tough drug laws.Ricky Jr served almost 30 years in jail before being released.However the film paints everybody in a bad light but it is so uninvolving. It is a tedious drama when it might had worked better as a cynical dark comedy.McConaughey raises the game when he appears. Newcomer Merritt brings a gauche naive quality to Ricky Jr who let's face it was not too bright. You can sense that when he 'borrow's' his grandfather's car, leaves the keys inside as he goes to meet his sister in a diner. The car gets stolen.",White Boy Rick

The starts in 1984 Detroit with Rick (Richie Merritt) and his dad (Matthew McConaughey) dealing in AK-47's with homemade silencers. Rick eventually starts dealing drugs and works as an informant for the FBI who don't interface with the state. His druggie sister is played by Bel Powley who has never heard of shampoo.

5,kosmasp,No good guys,9,6 February 2021,"Can someone be to young to be a criminal? Or a snitch? Or both? And if so, what do you need to convince him to go either way? Or both ways of course. White Boy Rick is based on a real character and a real story. It begins with a bang of sorts - though I reckon weapons still are a big draw in America. For the rest of the world it seems mental that at gun shows almost anyone (actually ANYONE) can buy automatic weapons.But this is not so much about the second amendment or guns in particular! No this is about this boy being sucked and dragged into a world he should not be involved in. This mostly happens to colored people, though they mostly face harder repercussions ... will it be true for our main character here too? Whoever knows the story, knows the end I reckon. I didn't - I can't say how it'll work out for those in the know. Still the story is very strong and the performances are even stronger! Tension filled from beginning to start ... with enough twists to keep you on your toes and interested",White Boy Rick
6,tavm,White Boy Rick was an involving true story drama though not very inspirational,7,15 September 2018,"Just watched this with my movie theatre-working friend. He and I watched mostly in silence-other movies we watch we sometimes comment on either the action or who certain actors are-so I'm thinking we were both involved in the story though he said afterwards it was ""okay"" and was glad he didn't have to pay admission for it, I have to admit I was also glad to not to have to do so as well. I mean, since it's based on a true story of a 15-year-old boy going from a gun runner to FBI informant to drug dealer who eventually gets to...well, I don't feel like revealing too much but I'll just say that while I was involved in the narrative, I didn't always find myself relating to the characters or having any feeling for their fates. Still, I wasn't bored enough to feel like sleeping during the time we both watched. The '80s setting felt authentic so there's that as well. And, yes, the performances are good but that's expected. I'll just say White Boy Rick is worth a look and leave it at that for now...",White Boy Rick
7,ferguson-6,"Father, Son and FBI",7,13 September 2018,"Greetings again from the darkness. When ""based on a true story"" appears, we can usually bank on either a hero or criminal as the subject. A good person, or a bad one. With this story, we get a teenager who is basically a good kid, but one who does bad things for what he believes are good reasons. It's likely to test your empathy and judgment. Director Yann Demange ('71) brings us the story of young Richard (Rick) Wershe, Jr through a script from writers Andy Weiss and brothers Noah and Logan Miller. We begin in 1984, the height of the ""Just Say No"" era, when Rick (a terrific debut by newcomer Richie Merritt) is a 14 year old living near poverty with his dad and older sister. Mom walked out years ago. Rick helps his dad in the firearm resale business (some legal, some not). Richard Wershe, Sr is played by Matthew McConaughey, who is outstanding as the dreamer who desperately wants a better life for himself and his kids. Unfortunately, the man simply lacks the capacity to do better. Sister Dawn is played by Del Powley (THE DIARY OF A TEENAGE GIRL), and Dawn is an addict who leaves/escapes home with her boyfriend. This is most definitely not ""The Brady Bunch"". Detroit was in the midst of a rapid and tragic decline, and the east side where Rick lived had already hit bottom with crime, violence, drugs and poverty. Rick's teenage resume would read firearms dealer, known gang associate, FBI informant, gunshot victim, cash-flowing drug dealer, baby daddy, rescuer of sister, and server of life sentence. It was quite a run for someone who hadn't yet celebrated birthday number 20. Director Demange shows us how two sides were played against the middle, with Rick being stuck in the middle with no hope for escape. We even see a TV clip of SERPICO for a bit of foreshadowing into life as an informant. What makes the film work, beyond the remarkable true story, is how each of the main characters is humanized to the point that we understand what makes them tick. Dad (McConaughey) is a dreamer who thinks he can sell enough guns to finance a chain of video stores that will be successful enough to keep his family together. Daughter Dawn tries to escape her ""loser"" dad by numbing herself with drugs and running off with the first guy that will take her. Son Rick takes advantage of his ability to create trust by trying to serve his father, a drug kingpin, the FBI, and himself. These three all seem to have good hearts and best intentions, but nothing every really works out for them - despite dad being a glass-half-full kind of guyThis is also a story of contrasts ... especially between black and white in many situations. We learn the difference between 'black jail time' and 'white jail time', and the FBI obviously chose Rick because he was a white kid who infiltrated a black crime ring - he even gets invited to the local skating rink to hangout, and to Las Vegas for a Tommy Hearns fight. There is also the way Richard Sr sees himself as ""above"" the criminals as he protests the proliferation and danger of drugs, while then turning around and selling guns to those who peddle drugs. Selective morality.The FBI recruits Rick to feed them information by threatening to arrest his dad. He is coerced into the world of selling drugs and then later railroaded by the Feds so that they could wash their hands and walk away ""clean"". Because of their influence, Rick is later sentenced to life in prison for non-violent offenses. Of course, he was surrounded by violence, and even the victim of it, but it begs the question of whether the punishment fit the crime. We are never sure if we should feel empathy for Rick, disgust at the system, or frustrated and fed up with a society that set this into motion. The supporting cast runs deep. Bruce Dern and the rarely seen Piper Laurie are Rick's grandparents, while Jennifer Jason Leigh and Rory Cochrane play the influential FBI agents. This marks a 25 year reunion for McConaughey and Cochrane from their appearance in DAZED AND CONFUSED (1993). Also appearing are RJ Cyler (""I'm Dying Up Here"") as Rick's friend Boo, Brian Tyree Henry as a detective, and Eddie Marsan and Jonathan Majors as drug dealers.A surprising amount of humor is mixed in with the gritty crime stuff and family struggles. There is even a comical FOOTLOOSE moment at the drive-in - providing yet another contrast between blacks and whites. Cinematographer Tat Radcliffe (""71) works wonders in some of the least appealing settings you'll likely find in a movie, and his approach perfectly complements our personal conflicts on who to pull for throughout this quagmire.",White Boy Rick
8,Wizard-8,"Okay, though storyline is quite cluttered",6,22 October 2019,"While I knew this movie didn't do very well in theaters when it was initially released, I decided to give it a chance when I spotted the Blu-ray in my local library, since it would be a free viewing. Under those circumstances, I did find the movie worth my time. The atmosphere in the movie feels very authentic; you can really feel the cold and poverty of the Detroit setting. All the actors do a pretty good job in their roles, and the movie always remained interesting and never boring. However, I didn't think that the movie was as great as it could have been. While the movie runs about 111 minutes, all the same it seems to be biting off a lot more than it can chew. It tries to do too much with not enough time, and as a result many characters and subplots don't seem to get as much depth as they needed to make a full impact (Bruce Dern, for example, hardly gets anything to do.) I don't know if this is how the movie was originally scripted, or that the movie got severely cut down in the editing room (though I suspect the latter.) The movie is still worth a look, but I recommend that you see it the way I did, as a free viewing and with expectations not too high.",White Boy Rick
9,deloudelouvain,Never trust the FBI and their shady deals.,7,3 January 2019,"It's only after reading the end credits that I saw that White Boy Rick is based on a true story. That makes it even more interesting but it's not going to change anything about my ratings. White Boy Rick is a good crime drama about the poor part of Detroit in the mid eighties, where a white family struggles to make ends meet. A single dad family with a junkie daughter and a son (Rick) that tries to make some money by selling weapons and drugs. Matthew McConaughey as the father and Richie Merritt as Rick, as well as the rest of the cast did a good job playing their characters. Matthew McConaughey was the most convincing actor in this sometimes slow but not bad movie. There's not a ton of action but sometimes you don't need to when the story is good.",White Boy Rick
10,blanbrn,A look at the dirty side of life that involves tragedy and sacrifice.,6,18 September 2018,"""White Boy Rick"" based on true accounts of the 1980's drug and weapons selling war that occurred on the streets of Detroit is a raw and tough look at street life and what it's like to make a living with drugs and poverty. Thru it all this film shows the pain and drama that the drug life brings and in turn and a twist the FBI used undercover and informant programs so well during the 80's as it's bone chilling and hurtful to see the sacrifice that one young boy named Richard Wershe Jr. made all while he was loved and supported by his dad Richard Wershe Sr.(Matthew McConaughey). Really this is a gritty blunt and raw film to watch while seeing the tragic pain and loss it can bring to people all because of a sacrifice.",White Boy Rick
11,MOscarbradley,Surprisingly sobering and well worth seeing.,8,18 December 2019,"Rick Wershe Jr's claim to fame, or infamy if you prefer, was that at fourteen he was the youngest ever FBI informant before becoming a kingpin drug dealer at sixteen. Yann Demange's (he made ""'71""), film ""White Boy Rick"" is a 'Serpico'-like account of how Rick got into this and it makes for surprisingly sobering viewing. It didn't help that his dad, (an absolutely terrific Matthew McConaughey), was a low-life gun dealer and his sister, (Bel Powley, brilliant), a junkie. You might say that with a family like this, a life of crime was inevitable.It's a tragic story that Demange never exploits and if it isn't quite in the same class as ""'71"" it may be because this is material we've seen too often in the past. In the title role newcomer Richie Merritt is excellent and the film looks terrific, (Tat Radcliffe was the cinematographer), moving nicely from Hollywood crime movie gloss to documentary realism often in the same scene. In the end, this is a grim, downbeat little movie but it's hard-to-believe true story is one worth telling and Demange tells it very well indeed.",White Boy Rick
12,ThomasDrufke,The Youngest Kingpin,8,3 October 2018,"A fascinating true story that I was previously unaware of, White Boy Rick is a relentlessly entertaining and surprising true crime drama about one of the most famous, and certainly youngest, FBI informant/drug dealer the country has ever seen. The McConaissance may be nearing its end but this film certainly proves that McConaughey still has plenty left in the tank at this stage in his career. But we can't really discuss the performances in the movie without giving major props to the newbie, Richie Merritt who displays the perfect amount of cool and vulnerability, especially in his early scenes. The only issue with the film I had was that it definitely has a little bit of trouble closing out. In these types of films, there's always a rise and a downfall, and perhaps even a second rise, and White Boy Rick didn't really know how to balance that in the third act.8.0/10",White Boy Rick
13,capone666,The Vidiot Reviews...,6,17 December 2018,"White Boy RickThanks to wild dog packs, the most popular drug in Detroit today is the rabies vaccine.Fortunately, this crime-drama occurs when the Motor City's drug of choice was crack.Fourteen-year-old Rick Wershe Jr. (Richie Merritt) sells modified machine-guns to street-gangs for his father Richard Wershe Sr. (Matthew McConaughey). When the FBI (Jennifer Jason Leigh, Rory Cochrane) approaches Rick about becoming a drug informant for them, he agrees so long as it keeps his father out of prison. But Rick's ratting on a kingpin (Jonathan Majors) costs him more than his dad.The true story of the FBI's youngest informant, this adaptation of Rick's biography provides great insight into his home life and the state of the city in which he dwelled. Less lavish than most drug-dealer yarns, it's the performances that keep this low-level crime story interesting.Luckily, Detroit roadways are now in such disrepair that drive-by shootings are impossible.

14,westsideschl,Docudrama,7,7 January 2019,"Basically a documentary of one person's life example of how our drug laws put sellers behind bars for far longer than someone who kills, sometimes several people, would receive. An authentic look at a local seller thus not the usual major fictionalized overkill story we usually get in drug crime movies.",White Boy Rick
15,UniqueParticle,Cool crime/drama for what it is,6,8 May 2019,"I don't know much about the real story, honestly. The kid is bit of a punk but he's got balls of steel for the intense circumstances. I also love the soundtrack & cast! Great entertainment for a couple of hours, although definitely not something I'd recommend to the faint of heart.",White Boy Rick
16,tomgillespie2002,A blur of competing plot threads held together by some terrific performances,6,23 January 2019,"If you've ever read up on Richard Wershe Jr, the drug kingpin whose life became the stuff of legend in the prion system over the years, you'll likely be aware that he was used as an FBI informant at just 14 years of age, while the Bureau funded his empire to keep him slinging on the streets and in the loop with any other criminal activity happening in his city of Detroit. After the FBI higher-ups discovered his age, they ditched him, and the dealer known as 'White Boy Rick' was eventually busted for selling cocaine and sentence to life in prison, a ridiculous sentence handed out via some Draconian law that has since been discarded. It's a fascinating, frustrating story that you wouldn't believe if it wasn't true, but Yann Demange's new film White Boy Rick doesn't quite know how to tell it. With so much to be told, the film seems to cast aside the central plot in favour of a domestic drama which, although terrifically acted by the whole cast, doesn't know where its priorities should lie.We first meet the young Rick (Richie Merritt) at a gun show with his father Richard Sr. (Matthew McConaughey). Despite his baby face and bum-fluff upper-lip hair, Rick is confident and street-smart, teaming up with Old Man Wershe to hustle a salesman into selling two machine guns for a ridiculously knocked-down price. Rick Sr. deals guns for a living, but the business is far from prosperous, and he dreams of someday owning a video store and living within the law. His daughter Dawn (Bel Powley) has picked up a nasty drug habit, and the family-of-three regularly have shouting matches in the street. Luckily, Grandpa (Bruce Dern) and Grandma (Piper Laurie) are just down the street to lighten the mood. After pulling off a few arms deals with gangster 'Lil Man' Curry (Jonathan Majors), Rick Jr. works his way into the cocaine business under the wing of an African-American gang. It doesn't take him long to get busted, but FBI agents Snyder (Jennifer Jason Leigh) and Byrd (Rory Cochrane), along with Detroit PD Detective Jackson (Brian Tyree Henry), are quick to pounce, handing the juvenile a fat pouch of cocaine to keep him in action, promising protection in exchange for information.It's around this point that the script by Andy Weiss, Logan Miller and Noah Miler starts to lose control, struggling to grasp the message it's trying to convey in a blur of competing plot threads. The family drama at the very centre of Rick's life is given the most attention, and it's engrossing, often devastatingly raw stuff. Powley and McConaughey are standouts, the former wrestling with an addiction spiralling rapidly out of control and the latter blaming himself for the path his son has decided to take. Rick Sr. hates drugs because they devastate lives, yet his guns are used for multiple murders across the city. The domestic scenes are so well done that you almost forget there's another story being told, one that is setting Rick up for a lengthy term in slammer. So when these moments arrive, you never really understand what's going on.Why exactly would the FBI put so much trust in a 14 year-old relatively new to the drugs scene, and just what does White Boy Rick do on a day-to-day basis? We don't really see him selling drugs, or spending money, or setting up contacts, or building this so-called empire, so Rick's real status and influence remains a mystery. Even his occasional meetings with Snyder and Bird are brief and bereft of information. Demange wants to make the point that Rick was ultimately set up by a government willing to ruthlessly exploit a minor for their own benefit, yet with so little time developing his criminal activities and relationship with the authorities, this aspect almost feels like an afterthought. As a portrait of family dysfunction, White Boy Rick excels, but if you want to really learn about how Richard Wershe Jr went from bread-line gun-runner to FBI informant to a landing a brutally unfair life sentence, I would opt for a Google.",White Boy Rick
17,cruise01,Great performances can not save the slow pace direction.,6,30 December 2018,"White Boy Rick (3 out of 5 stars).White Boy Rick is a decent biographical crime drama based on Richard Wershe Jr. being the youngest FBI informant at 14. He became a hustler and was good at it. The FBI decided to use him as an informant. And eventually Richie started dealing drugs. He was a good kid that tried to keep his family together. His blue collar father Richard (Matthew McConaughey) and his drug addict sister Dawn (Bel Powley).The performances were great with Matthew McConaughey and Richie Merritt. The plot was good capturing Richard Wershe Jr. mid teen years with his father hustling with weapons. And the FBI caught them and decided to use Richard to be an informant.However, the film does have a dull direction. It does not have any thrills or suspense that makes you worry for the real life characters. For the movie taking place in the 1980s. The direction fails to even have fun with that setting from the tedious music score. The movie trailer itself was energetic and exciting. The movie overall was a bit boring.Overall, White Boy Rick is a fair film. Acting was great. The plot was good. The direction was slow and boring.",White Boy Rick
18,Floated2,Solid true story drama doesn't reach full potential,6,28 July 2019,"Not knowing about the true original story thus not having expectations about how accurate the film plays out. There are some good moments of intrigue in the beginning and we see how things come about. White Boy Rick is a decent film but seems as if much detail was either missing or not completely explained and expanded.The movie does have a rather slow pace at times and somewhat goes downhill around 1986 around the part Ricky finds out he pregnated one of the girls thus becoming a father. Understanding it's based on a true story, so the ending isn't exactly a happy one here.Another thing is the character and choices of Rick Jr. were questionable. For instance he gets shot then ends up in the hospital to recover for some time. But once he comes back healthy, he decides to do business back to dealing drugs again with the same crew (as it seems) with the person who shot him, and nonetheless in the same location, hanging out at the same place, as if nothing ever happened. It's hard to find sympathy for the character knowing it was his choice which lead him the life sentence for selling.The movie works best as a family drama with their conflict, father/son relationship than it does as a crime drama. The acting from both McConaughey and Richie Merritt were good and believable but they weren't exactly Oscar worthy. In the end this movie is solid (depending on what you're looking for) but feels as if it doesn't reach its full potential that it could have been better, feeling somewhat disappointing. From the initial trailer, it looked like it might be an awards season type film, but it is left closer to average than great.",White Boy Rick
19,eddie_baggins,A scene-stealing McConaughey elevates a so-so crime drama,7,13 May 2019,"On paper everything seemed to suggest that White Boy Rick had it made.An up and coming director in the form of Yann Demange, who was headhunted by Hollywood after his independent thriller '71 got tongues wagging in 2014, a true life story that was ripe for the picking and one of Hollywood's most beloved leading men Matthew McConaughey sporting the year's best on screen mullet, but sadly for all, White Boy Rick came and went from cinemas with little fanfare after middling box-office and equally as so-so reviews.Most seem to agree that there's nothing terribly wrong with Demange's film, with the consensus instead being that it's just perfectly middle of the line, watchable without ever elevating itself to something more, that special something that makes some true life crime film's more than the sum of their parts.It's hard to argue with this overriding feeling that White Boy Rick is disappointing, in the fact it feels like it could've been so much more, the elements are seemingly there but never molded together at the same time but it doesn't stop Demange's film from being an entertaining examination of the American dream against the backdrop of a drug-addled Detroit in the mid to late 80's.Acting alongside newcomer Richie Merritt (who was literally plucked from the public for this role, without ever previously acting) who plays the titular Rick Wershe Jr., who rose to infamy in the USA after he was used as an informant by the FBI at the age of 15 years old to then move into a life of drug slinging, Demange and McConaughey do solid work in bringing this tale to life as we follow this bizarre journey from depressing start to depressing end.For an actor with little to no experience, Merritt does a amicable job of bringing Rick to life, a stoic like character that seemed to be able to oppress his deeper emotions while McConaughey is a blast as the trailer park like Richard Wershe Sr., the actor bringing both some hilarity and emotion to the tale that ends up acting as a performance that seems cut from a better and more well-rounded film.The problem for Demange's film is that it flows from situation to situation without much care or thought, there's a lot to cover here in a runtime that sits below two hours and it never feels as though the moments in Rick's life that are key touchpoints get as much airtime as they deserve, meaning our emotional connection as an audience member can only go so far.This makes White Boy Rick a cold affair that once every now and then shows glimmers of the heart that lay beneath the surface (Rick meeting his new baby or Wershe Sr. coming to the realization his failed as a father are some such moments) but these glimmers are nothing more, quickly covered up by a continual procession of moments that come and go without much fanfare.Final Say -Always watchable and a nice showcase for newcomer Merritt and the scene-stealing Matthew McConaughey, White Boy Rick is a solid if unremarkable telling of a crazy true life tale that will be hard to remember in the coming year's.3 ½ pancakes out of 5",White Boy Rick
20,paul-allaer,Improbable crime drama based on real-life events,7,17 September 2018,"""White Boy Rick"" (2018 release; 116 min.) brings the true story of Ricky ""White Boy Rick"" Wersche Jr. As the movie opens, we are told it is ""1984"" and we see Ricky, then aged 14, and his dad buying guns at a trade show in Ohio, which his dad intends to resell back in Detroit. Young Rick is soon getting into the action too, but he is snagged by the FBI and reluctantly becomes an informant. What will become of young Rick? At this point we are 10 min. into the movie but to tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: this is the latest film from French director Yann Demange, who previously brought us the excellent ""71"" (about the conflict in Northern Ireland). Here he goes in a very different direction, examining the life and times of a teenager who for reasons too long to explain becomes tangled up in crime at a young age. The movie is plot-heavy, and hence I really don't want to say a lot more on that. Just watch! Striking as well is how terrible Detroit already looked in the mid-80s (the movie covers the period 84 to 88). And that was 30 years ago! The movie does an excellent job recreating the zeitgeist from that era, including through extensive use of music from that era. Matthew McConaughey as the dad is superb, even though in a strict sense, this movie is not about the dad as such and hence McConaughey is playing second fiddle. Newcomer Richie Merritt as Ricky is a revelation and surely we have not seen the last of him. Keep an eye out for Jennifer Jason Leigh as one of the FBI agents. And in an even smaller role, there is Bruce Dern (as McConaughey's dad) and an almost unrecognizable Piper Laurie as his mom. Bottom line is that these 2 hours flew by in no time, and I really enjoyed the movie more than I had expected.The movie's release date had been pushed back a number of times, usually a bad sign (but not in this particular instance). The movie finally opened wide this weekend, and I couldn't wait to see it. The early Friday evening screening where I saw this at here in Cincinnati was attended just okay, and nowhere close to a sell-out. If you are in the mood for an improbable if engaging crime drama, I'd suggest you check out ""White Boy Rick"", be it in the theater, on VOD, or eventually on DVD/Blu-ray, and draw your own conclusion.",White Boy Rick
21,stevendbeard,Interesting But A Little Slow,6,16 September 2018,"I saw ""White Boy Rick"", starring Matthew McConaughey-The Dark Tower, Texas Chainsaw Massacre:The Next Generation; Jennifer Jason Leigh-The Hateful Eight, Fast Times at Ridgemont High; Bruce Dern-The Hateful Eight, Last Man Standing and introducing Richie Merritt, in his first movie.
This movie is based on a true story that took place in the 1980's in Detroit, Michigan. It tells the story of the country's youngest-he was 14 when it all started-street hustler, drug dealer and F.B.I. informant. Newcomer Richie plays Rick Wershe Jr., the aforementioned self made gangsta and Matthew plays his pappy, Rick senior. It seems that Matthew was a great influence on his son-he said, tongue in cheek. He would take him to gun shows and teach him how to negotiate the best deals on an AK 47. Matthew's wife left the family-I wonder why-which led to his daughter getting mixed up with drugs and running away from home, too. Bruce plays Matthew's father and he was a real winner too-he lived across the street from Matthew. Richie hangs with the wrong crowd and gets snatched up by F.B.I. agent Jennifer, who offers him money to basically keep doing what he is already doing, the drug dealing thing, for inside info on his boss. One of the drug lords gives Richie his nickname, 'White Boy Rick', for obvious reasons-he kind of stands out in their group, being a Caucasian. It is an interesting story but it is slow in parts. At the end of the film, you learn about the current circumstances of the real life characters and you get to hear an audio recording of the real Rick Wershe Jr.'s voice-no video however.

23,kluseba,Hard to separate the facts from the fancy,7,19 October 2018,"White Boy Rick might be based upon a true story but it should be mentioned that it is largely based upon subjective claims that cannot be fully verified. The movie tells a story that might or might not be fully or partially true about a teenage boy from a broken neighbourhood in the decrepit city of Detroit, symbol for the downfall of the American Dream, who gets involved in criminal gangs at the tender age of fourteen. He becomes an informant for the Federal Bureau of Investigation which almost costs him his life. Even after being dropped by the intelligence and security service, the tough protagonist with a soft core remains involved in criminal activities and exposes himself and those around him to great danger.On the positive side, the movie oozes with atmosphere and has a quite realistic touch. White Boy Rick efficiently works with contrasts. The decrepit settings of Detroit as opposed to the world of steel and glass in Las Vegas, the poor neighbourhoods as opposed to shiny clubs, the innocent children getting in touch with pitiless gangster bosses and their ruthless associates evoke strong emotions, ideas and images. The film obviously offers some social criticism related to drugs, family and even governmental institutions. The acting performances are brilliant and the story is at times heart-breaking, especially Bel Powley playing the protagonist's drug-addicted runaway sister is very convincing.On the negative side, the film's pace is quite plodding. It doesn't help that the story is somewhat unfocused. It starts at a certain point in the protagonist's life, accompanies him for a few years and ends with a boring text about his future fate. With a few more scenes, such as his birth into a broken family and the departure of his mother at the beginning or his release from jail and reunion with his family at the end would have made for a more complete movie.If you like dramatic gangster movies that offer some social criticism instead of action sequences, you should give White Boy Rick a try. It has enough redeeming qualities to be one of the better gangster movies in recent memory. However, it could have been even better with a better pace and more precise script.",White Boy Rick

Cue the early hip hop tracks & we're thrown into the depressing world of Rick, a latch key kid growing up w/a loving yet irresponsible father (Matthew McConnaughey), a drug addicted sister & some well meaning grandparents. In trying to save his dad's life, he volunteers to go undercover for the FBI & police to keep track of the players involved in the drug game. In a case of being overwhelmingly over his head, Rick tries to play both sides of the law as best he can but he's not the brightest bulb around so his days of being a player are numbered. Nothing we haven't seen before (it kinda reminded me of Donnie Brasco w/its cop/crook dynamic) but it does move when it needs to & the cast of supporting players are vivid & of the moment.

That certainly doesn't make it special in any way, but the story it tells is a true one I had never heard of which seemed interesting. This is one sad story and the movie pulls no punches, it's bleak from the first. The way it unfolds has a sense of dread as to what next. In this chaotic mess there's the bond between a single father and his son which gets so turned around it could only happen in a cesspool of a dark world without hope. This movie was real enough it was painful to watch. I'd have to say the story and the director pulled no Hollywood turns for embellishment. If you're curious watch this heart wrenching unravelling of lives. The saddest thing isn't even that it's a true story. Far worse it is is just one of thousands not unlike it. It is truly heartbreaking in its sincerity and realism. Those without options often get turned into criminals and used, with false beliefs shattered, lives destroyed.

28,rgkarim,Does This Boy Have Game? A White Boy Rick Review,7,16 September 2018,"Biographies seem to be popular this year, focusing on a number of people and their ""contributions"" to society. Today's biography is more about the horrors of a system than a contribution, but these moments are certainly entertaining. Hi, Robbie K here with another look at the world of movies and what lies in store for the price of a ticket. Let's get started, as I review: Movie: White Boy Rick (2018)Director:
 Yann Demange
Writers:
 Andy Weiss, Logan Miller 
Stars:
 Matthew McConaughey, Richie Merritt, Bel Powley
LIKES: Good Acting: Richie Meritt and McConaughey are the central pillars of the movie, holding much of the plot on their shoulders and doing a wonderful job bringing their characters to life. Meritt in particular has to cover a very complex character, borderline between punk kid and individual of poor circumstances. He finds that balance very well, makes for an engaging character and really gives you the full experience of the nightmare that Rick went through. As for McConaughey, he is still the sleazy role, but it's curbed this time for a respectable character you want to follow. Their chemistry impeccable and the heart of the movie as they integrate with their well casted supporting crew. The Setting: It is not as far back as Unbroken, but we get dropped right into a reconstructed 80's hood, where the danger, drugs, and depression lie in wait like a hungry pack of wolves. All the costumes, cars, and buildings were retrofitted to have the look and it works quite well to get you into the setting. The Drama/Portrayal: White Boy Rick has a lot of details about the young man's life, and you'll get to see much of it in this installment. Drama lovers are sure to become entangled in all the messes of Rick's life, with those liking the Law And Order scenarios enjoying this one the most. This film will give you a lot of the 411 on rick's life and bring about all the emotions that come with it. The Music: Surprisingly, the film had a fantastic soundtrack to report on, a mixture of funk, hip-hop, and a little soul to mirror the themes of the movie. It's upbeat and has toe tapping beats to keep you going, and actually brings a little edge to the scenes themselves. Bravo to the casting director for their selection because it really worked. The Pace: While slow at times, the movie does a nice job moving through the various years of Rick's journey to get you to the end game. It is a longer movie, but for the most part it doesn't feel that slow, or rough to get through all the nuts and bolts of this adventure. Drama lovers of course will not find any of this remotely boring, but if you are not that type and along for the ride, you should find much of this movie entertaining. DISLIKES: The Stereotypical Design: White Boy Rick's title brings with it a wave of stereotypical portrayals in just about every character in the film. Whether it be the impoverished, the wannabe gangsters, or the gangsters themselves, the movie really hammers the portrayals to such extremes that it gets a bit cheesy. Perhaps this is how the real-life characters were, but if not, the magnification of these personality quirks got annoying for me at times. Even Rick himself crossed that line sometimes, so brace yourselves. The Lazy Dialogue: Sometimes quite poetic, White Boy Rick's dialogue is mostly focused on being either really complacent (full of really dumb pronunciations or Rick being an idiot to be funny), or really lazy (F bomb laden rants). For such a deep story, I had hoped for a little more movie magic to buffer out the scratchy, lackluster lines they came up with. McConaughey managed to have some beautifully scripted pieces to work with, and the secondary characters got their fair share of poetry in, but for the most part it was a little too stuffed with normalcy/realism to be impressive for me. More use Of The Secondary Characters: Rick knew a lot of people, and his family seemed to be a gigantic rock to which he based his decisions on. While the movie captured the key details, I felt they didn't quite utilize or introduce the characters that well for me. Names were dropped at random, their inclusion was sporadic and I felt many of them had more of a role to play than what was presented. Many of these kingpins and servants could have been epic antagonists to spice up the story, but again my lack of research and not being with Rick means I don't know who these guys really were. Disjointed Story: While the movie has covered a lot of Rick's life story components, the presentation I believe was off for me here too. Each of the issues Rick faced felt compartmentalized, individuals segments that were prematurely closed and then randomly open at intervals that were inconsistent. Yes, you still get the effects presented with the story, but so many pieces without a strong, underlying foundation, led to a weaker representation of what could have been an epic drama. Overall it's not horrible, but it could have been so much better. 
The Verdict:  White Boy Rick is one of those movies that has its fair share of drama to exploit and dive into. A fantastic setting with great central acting will be the keystones to bring these events to life and pull those liking drug/crime story lovers into the mix. The problem is, the movie sort of lost itself in the presentation, not giving clear focus on Rick's character or stories that he had to share and instead giving you snippets into his life. With how much was going on, there could have been a gold mine of a story instead of just some nuggets they portrayed. Still, it gets props for completing the information, and perhaps a director's cut could improve upon it in the future. As such, this History meets Lifetime Movie presentation can be held until it comes to Redbox, and would highly encourage you to take that route. My scores are: Crime/Drama: 6.5-7.0

29,burlesonjesse5,VIEWS ON FILM review of White Boy Rick,7,25 September 2018,"""You're going to get in too deep and they're never gonna let you out"". The ugly, gun-toting flick I'm about to review is palatable but it doesn't quite get deep enough. Did I mention that it's drug-fueled too?Anyway, White Boy Rick is a non-fiction endeavor that allows Bruce Dern little screen time and portrays 80's Detroit as a gloom and doom vista view. With scenes that only rear themselves in the winter time, ""White Boy"" features Matthew McConaughey and newcomer Richie Merritt giving fantastic father and son performances. It also has McConaughey and Rory Cochrane reuniting in a pic after nearly 25 years (remember Dazed and Confused?) As far as fall releases go in 2018, ""White Boy"" teases but it never really takes off from a dramatic standpoint (despite some raw acting and a little family dysfunction). That doesn't mean I'm not gonna recommend it.White Boy Rick chronicles the three-year span of one Richard Wershe Jr. At the wide-eyed age of 14, Rick became the youngest FBI informant ever. Wershe eventually got caught for selling cocaine and was sentenced to life in prison. Rick gets shot, becomes a father, hustles like a seasoned veteran, and learns to cut crack all before the age of 17. Talk about an early dose of life experiences. ""White Boy"" as harbored character study and choppily edited catalyst, cuts corners with Rick's drug dealing plight even though the main character is in almost every frame. Oh well. ""White Boy's"" director (Yann Demange) creates a movie that's darkly dense, rift with diverting sleaze, and rich in its sense of time and place. There's nastiness, atmospherics, and danger all around. Sure Demange's storytelling sensibilities go off-kilter and yes, his ending makes you salivate for a little more reverence (as does the presence of the supporting Matthew McConaughey). Still, White Boy Rick has heightened, old school soundtrack and escapism residuals. Its Scarface/Boogie Nights pigeon is slightly more caustic than being just black and ""white"". My rating: 3 stars.",White Boy Rick
30,elliotjeory,Should of been better,6,6 November 2019,I was looking forward to seeing this but was left disappointed on how the story turned out.

33,proud_luddite,Good but a downer,6,11 November 2018,"Based on a true story: in Detroit of the mid-1980s, Richard Wershe Jr (Richie Merritt) - aka White Boy Rick - is an early teen whose rough-edged father (Matthew McConaughey) enrolls him into questionable activity on the sale of guns. Rick gets further into the criminal world and becomes an informant for the police.Many of the scenes - criminals having fun, dysfunctional families having it out despite the love underneath, law enforcement officers being deceptive etc. - are well acted and directed. The trouble is there are too many of them and it's difficult to keep track of what is happening. Also, the conclusion is a real downer.This is not to say this film should not have been made as the content is a story truly worth telling. It might have been better expressed in the documentary form.

36,aciessi,Not That Bad.,6,22 September 2018,"White Boy Rick is the cinematic equivalent of Sloppy Joes. It tastes good, but it never coalesces into something satisfying, with a solid base of support to keep it together. White Boy Rick has all the ingredients of a great film. A stellar all-star cast, excellent cinematography, razor-sharp editing and a story that keeps you invested the entire time. But something seems missing. For one, some of the story seems rushed to get to the more interesting aspects, without properly explaining how we get there. For example, how did the FBI hone into Rick and his father for an FBI investigation? The agents just appear in the beginning, and we're supposed to roll with it. Now you understand why I compared it to Sloppy Joes. The exposition, at times, is pretty sloppy. But fortunately, never once did that take me out of the film. White Boy Rick is a thoroughly good time at the movies. The performances, notably from McConaughey, are top notch. White Boy Rick himself garners sympathy as a lost soul, and that's important to clarify. Some people might write this off as a run-of-the-mill crime thriller biting off ""The Wire"". If I was so inclined to be jaded, maybe I'd agree. But always give things the benefit of the doubt. Give it a watch?",White Boy Rick
37,rockman182,White Boy Rick (2018),6,14 September 2018,"Ah, Donna Summer and an old timey 80's feel. The trailer for this film was decent for that. Also, we are all still trying to see what Matthew McConaughey is doing next, right? As long as its not those weird Lincoln commercials of course. When you think about this is a fairly interesting true story. A 14 year old informant for the FBI who also becomes a kingpin? That's insane. While there are positives to look at in this film and its well acted on all fronts, I think this story could have been presented better.The film is the true story of the young life of Richard Wershe Jr. also know as White Boy Rick. His dad is an arms dealer and his sister a drug addict, so he does what he can to get by. He becomes involved in selling guns and dealing and soon becomes an informant for the FBI. Things escalate for him as his responsibilities increase and the street life becomes life threatening. The title character is played by newcomer, Richie Merritt. The film also stars Bel Powley and Jennifer Jason Leigh.I think the film was well acted from all involved. McConaughey continues to be on top of his game and his own renaissance and Merritt and Powley are great. The basis for the story is interesting but I feel like the film itself doesn't present itself in an interesting manner. I never thought I was watching something great and I feel like there is an under utilization of talented side actors as well. It was just hard to connect with the film and feel a true emphatic reaction or care for Rick.I don't know if this is one of the cases where the story reads better on paper than on film but that may be the case here. Its fun when Powley or McConaughey are on screen but I think overall it was hard to identify with or get invested in the characters. I think the most hard hitting moments were the texts right before the credits. It doesn't matter so much this was just something to watch to prepare for the more anticipated releases of the week (A Simple Favor and The Predator).6/10",White Boy Rick
38,RforFilm,White Boy Rick is an interesting rags-to-slightly better rags crime story that could have been great had they gotten a better lead.,5,20 September 2018,"We've heard and seen this story before. Achieving the American dream of success through illegal means. Not only is this a trope that has been done tons of times, but movies like The Godfather and Scarface used it to become their own successes as some of the greatest movies ever. So why is this story constantly told over again despite the emphasis that what these characters are doing is wrong? I think it has to do with another kind of American pride; the spirit of ingenuity. Even though we know that theft and hurting others is wrong, but we still admire people that do these things to make it one step ahead of the next guy. People are attracted to people that are driven enough in spirit to reach their goals. We all want that same spirit and try to figure out how to apply that to ourselves.So if this trope is used a lot, then why hear it again? It's all about how different it can present itself that we haven't heard from The Godfather or Scarface or Goodfellas. As luck would have it, we haven't heard it done from the perspective of someone whose only a teenager. So let's hear the story of White Boy Rick. In the mid 1980s, Richard Wershe Jr. (played by Richie Merritt) is constantly encouraged by his father Richard Wershe Sr. (played by Matthew McConaughey) to never run away from your problems and find a way to personal success. This is a lot to swallow considering how they both live in the slums of Detroit and Richard Sr. is still dirt broke and unsuccessful. As a lot of kids are in bad neighborhoods, Richard Jr. is steered towards the local gang as he manages to sell guns with silencers to them at a steep price.As he gets in further with fellow gang members, he's convinced by FBI agents Alex (played by Janet Jason Leigh) and Frank (played by Rory Cochrane) to buy and sell drugs, as a way to develop a network that can be further investigated. Though Richard is not happy about his teenage son doing these things to get rich, he also doesn't put in an effort to stop him. This gets his son in the middle of a lot of the gang conflict, including them wondering if ""White Boy Rick"" is even a needed asset. There are two things here that separate White Boy Rick from the other ""American Dream Through Illegal Means"" movies. First, the focus is on this kid whose making these dangerous choices. Secondly, this isn't your typical rags-to-riches movie. I'd say it's more of a rags-to-slightly better rags. So we have a character whose only in it for a few things he wants before declaring himself ""wealthy"". I have to say that does make this kid more relatable then a lot of other gangsters who are in it for the gold and money. Now does this translate for a good movie?The plot within is a tad clunky. I think a lot of it has to do with Matthew McConaughey and his relationship with his son. It stands out much more in the first half when we see him have to witness his son's descent into organized crime and trying to convince himself that this is going to help him. The first half of the movie also understands that crime in this area would be enough of a draw. It's his descent into the dark side that's really engaging. Where a lot of things drop off is within the second half.While I won't spoil what happens, something does happen to Richie Merritt's character that makes him question his actions. This is when the movie has a hard time focusing on whose perspective and doesn't even seem to know whether we should be sympathetic to the main character. Perhaps if a better actor was set in place it would be more engaging, but Richie Merritt is awkward and is not much of an emoter. It doesn't help that when next to Matthew McConaughey, he's overpowered by the more experienced and charming actor. I'll give this five Star of David blings out of ten. It does have a lot of interesting portrayals about the realities and dreams of these people that are in such positions. Had they gotten a better lead, this may have been one of my favorites of the year. I'd say it'll make a better rental or Netflix movie of the night. Give it a watch and see if you can overcome so-so acting.",White Boy Rick
39,bankofmarquis,Would have been better if at actually WERE a McCanaughey flick,5,17 September 2018,"If you believe the advertisement for the latest Matthew McConaughey flick, WHITE BOY RICK, you would think that it is...well...a Mathew McConaughey flick.And you would be wrong.Set in the mid-1980's, WHITE BOY RICK tells the true tale of Richard Wershe, Jr. a youth who gets involved in drug trafficking and becomes an informant for the FBI and who...eventually...becomes the person who has been incarcerated for the longest time in Michigan for a non-violent crime.Sounds intriguing enough you say. And the cast list says that McConaughey is starring as Richard Wershe, so that could be interesting.But you would be wrong again.McConaughey stars as Richard Wershe, SENIOR, the father of Richard Wershe, Jr. who is played by Richie Merritt, in his film debut - and that's the problem. The actor that might have made the slightness of the screen play and story interesting is sidelined as a minor, supporting character and the lead role - the role that is front and center for the ENTIRE film - is played by someone in his screen debut who brings nothing interesting to the role.Director Yann Demage does a credible enough job moving the plot forward from event to event, but doesn't craft an over-arching storyline - or character transformation - that makes each of these individual scenes work with each other. It's a series of vignettes, but not a total movie - at least not a total, emotionally satisfying film.McConaughey, of course, is the best thing in this film - he has the ""low-life, struggling, white trash"" persona perfected. But he is in the film not nearly enough and his ""big"" scenes aren't big enough to make his appearance in this film worthwhile.Jennifer Jason Leigh, Bruce Dern and Piper Laurie are wasted in even smaller supporting roles and the other actors/characters are just forgettable faces in forgettable situations. Only Bel Powley as White Boy Rick's sister is interesting to watch and has a character worth remembering.There is a good movie in here, I'm sure, this just isn't it. Disappointing would be the best word I would use for it.Letter Grade C+ (for McConaughey and Powley's presence - and for the sure fun of seeing Dern and Laurie together on the screen).5 (out of 10) stars and you can take that to the Bank (ofMarquis)",White Boy Rick
40,abisio,An Very important subject that deserves a better movie.,8,17 December 2018,"I never heard about Rick Wershe Jr.; how the FBI used him by threatening to arrest his father; get him shoot (and almost killed) and then send him to jail for a basically minor drug crime.
What starts as a basically crime movie becomes something completely different particularly when you realize that the worse people are the law enforcement ones.
Sadly, even with the effort of a Mathew Matthew McConaughey playing the most unpleasant, unbearable and worthless character, can save the inexperience of a director and a writer, unable to put in proper images these terrifying tale. Matthew McConaughey deserves not an Oscar but a Novel prize. His character required and ego-less or an unknown one. It is a pure White Trash father, a complete looser with not one redeemable moment. And he does convincing and never looking for any sympathy.
In any way the story is really worth to be known; so please give it the opportunity. I will surprise you.",White Boy Rick
41,kjproulx,"A Streamlined, Yet Effective Film",7,12 September 2018,"Although there is just more content being made today than in any other decade in history, it does seem like films based on a true story have become even more prominent throughout the medium. Not knowing much about this particular story, known as White Boy Rick, I went into this film not truly knowing where it would end up, but still managed to feel a little unsatisfied with it as a whole. There are many biopics out there that handle material in a unique way, but everything about this film feels safe. While the story itself is quite fascinating and the character of Rickie enjoyable to watch, I can't help but reflect on the fact that this film strayed as far away from taking risks as it possibly could have. Here's why I believe White Boy Rick is an enjoyable film to watch, but won't really surpass anyone's expectations of it.Being an insider for the FBI, White Boy Rick follows young Rick Wershe Jr., played by Richie Merritt in his breakout role, as he dives deeper and deeper into the crime of drug trafficking, becoming too involved for his own good. Since stories like this have been told before, I was hoping for something a little more interesting in terms of structure, but it really just feels like a series of events and set pieces that will eventually lead him to his eventual downfall. There is a through-line that gives this film a beginning and an end, but it really just feels like a character progression and evolution, rather than a film that has been structured as three acts. This was a little disappointing, considering the plot itself could've shown a slightly darker side. This is where the movie started to lose me a little.Although the story is meant to be light-hearted in most moments (due to the nature of this crazy story), there are quite a few dramatically effective scenes to go along with them, but it almost felt like the movie was getting a little too serious for the writers, so they had to take away from some of the emotion by adding jokes. The best portions of this movie are when Rick is having a great time with his ""friends"" and hanging out at the roller rink or breaking laws. This is what the movie needed more of, but the family dynamic is a little too prevalent in my opinion. White Boy Rick needed a better balance between its storylines, but maybe that's just me.On top of everything, I think the most disappointing aspect of this movie is the fact that everything feels very standard in terms of filmmaking. From the editing to the direction, to the score and songs throughout the movie, it all felt very formulaic. I felt like I was watching a movie that kept wanting to take risks but decided to play it safe in order to appeal to the real people involved, as well as appealing to the masses. That being said, for a movie that relies heavily on family, the performances need to be top-notch. Otherwise, it would fall apart.Matthew McConaughey gives one of his best efforts in a while and a particular scene actually had me in tears. This really shouldn't come as a surprise, though, seeing as everyone expects him to bring a lot to the table nowadays. Newcomer Richie Merritt is the one to talk about, however. While his performance isn't something that people will be talking about for decades to come, this was quite the impressive first impression. The actor himself has had experiences like this film's premise throughout his childhood, so maybe that added to his talent here, but I'd say look out for his future work.In the end, White Boy Rick has a stellar cast and a talented crew across the board, but it never feels like it's trying to impress or surprise. This is a series of events that lead up to today's current state, and while the story itself is very interesting and makes for a very enjoyable movie, it doesn't have the energy that it promised from its trailers.

It's like an old time gangster movie in some ways, yet young Richie has such a sexy, vulnerable innocent quality. He's one half Jimmy Cagney and one half a very young John Travolta! There are all kinds of emotions in Richie's world. He wants to make his father proud, protect his sister, and be a regular guy in the neighborhood. The fact that the cops always ask him to do the *wrong* thing instead of helping him make better choices is shown in a quiet but devastating way. Jennifer Jason Leigh plays a lady FBI agent who is totally evil, but she never looks like she's trying to be the Wicked Witch of the West. So many great performances and a tragic ending!",White Boy Rick

It was not terrible but it was not bad. Would I watch it again. Probably not it was just one of those films watch it once. And kind of let it go it could have been a lot better. It was no Oscar in my eyes. Mathew has done much better work. Look at that one film he did he lost a lot of weight and had AIDS, In that on film, and look at that other film he did he was told the police the story about his crazy dad and little brother. Then, in the end, he ended up killing that police why. Because of that police were nuts to his own mother. So he killed him to pay for his sins.

45,sweidman-28016,Not Bad,6,28 October 2018,"White Boy Rick Review:White Boy Rick is a crime, drama based on a true story of Rick Wershe Jr., Richie Merritt, and how he was an FBI informant, street hustler, and a drug kingpin in 1980s Detroit all before he was 16. I was very interested in this movie mainly because Matthew McConaughey was in it playing the father and I love him. I didn't like the movie as much as I thought I would though. The main reason was the pacing. It would go like something interesting, then we'll really slow it down for 20 min, then something interesting, then slow it down. It was like that for the first two acts. The final one was interesting the whole time. Richie Merritt was the stand out of the movie. Surprisingly this was his first movie ever. I can see a potential Golden Globe nomination. Matthew McConaughey played basically his same character that he always does. I thought he might do a little something different but it was basically the same and he's good at that. Jennifer Jason Leigh was in it playing one of the FBI agents. I like her but she has such an annoying voice. It's like she's monotone and doesn't care about anything. Her performance was fine though. The other stand out for me was Bel Powley as Dawn Wershe, Rick's sister. That was my favorite part of the whole movie: the relationship between Rick and Dawn. They were going through a lot of problems but those two always seemed to get along so well. The movie was pretty interesting as it unfolded. A lot of unexpected things happened. There were some scenes that were unnecessary and could've been cut out. It was just the pacing that really made it boring to watch sometimes. I also thought there was going to be a little more comedy based on the one trailer I watched but there wasn't as much in it which is fine. It's not going to be an Oscar winning movie. It's not bad at all, it just could've been better with it's pacing and cut out some unnecessary scenes. With a strong performance by Richie Merritt and an interesting story I would recommend it.My Grade: B-",White Boy Rick

The story is bizarre and gripping, and is done really well in my opinion.The lynchpin is the central performance from Richie Merritt, which was solid and very engaging. Matthew McConaughey was expectedly fantastic, and both of them were playing really interesting characters which were great to follow.I thought the film was maybe lacking in its structure and pacing. Things seemed to come and go too quickly at times, and there were moments that felt a little choppy. For the most part though I thought White Boy Rick did a great job of exploring its characters.

First, the music supervisor needed to be fired. The credits starts with ""1984"" but then they play songs from 1982 and songs that really weren't played that way.The cast was wrong and each actor tried too hard to become the ""character."" The result was a phoniness due to an inexperienced director. I just hate when filmmakers go for realism but then overdoes it. Some of the wardrobe was good, but then others seemed way over the top, more like a caricatureThe writing wasn't authentic. Written by someone who likely watched 80s movies trying to capture this.

Totally against drugs etc and the violence and crime that comes with it. I personally don't believe its ultimately as portrayed a ' none violent crime ' because people get hurt either side of drug war and drug use but 30 years FFS . Given what some of Trump's clowns got handed down like Rodger Stone it's just way too long. I think the film missed a trick by just adding that on at the end .

The actor who plays White Boy Rick has some charm about him, he could be good leading man material in the future. Matthew McCounaghey does a good job as well. I was impressed at a lot of things they did get right about Detroit, it's clear the director and writer spent time here. However, I don't think they actually employed anyone from Detroit to go over the script; I winced seeing characters call pop ""soda."" Huge mistake. White Boy Rick also had more of a rural Michigan accent, not an ""urban"" one. I mean, it's pretty bad when the film plays an audio interview from the guy with an accent that one could mistake for a country singer from Oklahoma. Why go with the urban thing then?Either way, it was still pretty good. Some things about the eighties were a bit off, but that was alright.",White Boy Rick
53,itsbobr,Kind of Informative,7,28 December 2018,"This is a True Story about Ricky Wershe Jr (Richie Merritt) who in Detroit in the 1980s was a Hustler, FBI Informant, and Drug Kingpin before he was 16-yrs old.The Wershe family consisting of Richard the father (Matthew McConaughey), Dawn (Bel Powley) Ricky's sister and Ricky, Jr are down on their luck. Richard sells AK-47s with silencer, Dawn is a cocaine junkie, and Ricky Jr. sells what the father makes - mostly silencers for pistols and AK-47s - in his basement. It's not until Ricky tells his father that they can't live like they have been and need money and the only way to get it is to sell drugs, which Richard is against, but gives in to get his Video Store. The FBI tag Ricky Jr to be a informant (with pay) to learn where the drugs are coming from so the FBI can make a big bust.We see Ricky known as White Boy Rick to the Curry gang run by John Curry (Jonathan Majors) hustle and mingle with gang members until one day Ricky is shot because he was thought to have betrayed them.I had the feeling that all the story wasn't told, just the main parts because some things happened too fast. For instance, when Ricky was shot when the Curry gang thought he betrayed them, Ricky was able to get back in their good graces like nothing happened. Not much was explained In this matter.Notables: Jennifer Jason Leigh as FBI Agent Snyder; Brian Tyre Henry as Detective Jackson; Bruce Dern as Ricky's grandfather; Piper Laurie as Ricky's grandmother; Eddie Marsan as Art Derrick a drug dealer; and Rory Cochrane as FBI Agent Byrd.Matthew McConaughey as Richard, the father tried to keep his family together, but was powerless to do anything against the FBI when Ricky was arrested and convicted for possession and distribution of drugs that Ricky maintained the Cops planted the drugs. We see where the FBI did not protect Ricky and this is where their words to trust them to Richard meant absolutely nothing.Richie Merritt as White Boy Rick did an exceptional job trying to do the right thing by playing both sides of the fence. His expressions were spot on in all situations. Kudos.Statements at the end of the movie will tell you what happened to the main characters. (7/10)Violence: Yes. Sex: No. Nudity: No. Humor: No.

56,Lewis_Heather787,Not what I was expecting!,6,22 September 2018,"Overall the film is ok/average, it is definitely not what I was expecting. Now I know that film trailers can be misleading and show certain scenes that don't make it to the final cut of the film. With this film I was going in think I was going to get some quirky, fast paced, shocking crime thriller. That is the sense I got from the trailers. However this film is something else entirely, I'm not quite sure I like it.Instead of being over the top, fast paced or shocking, the film decides instead to focus on the family dynamic mainly between a father and son and occasionally throws in a sister to the relationship. I commend Yann Demange for attempting to give a different angle, however I feel as if the film is missing some wow factor or something astonishing. The film is very slow even for a runtime less than two hours, it can tend to meander here and there, as if the film itself is waiting for something to happen. The cast overall is fine, you always know that McConaughey is going to give a great performance and indeed he does for the most part, but its nothing that I don't expect from him these days. Shoutout should go to Richie Merritt who for his first on-screen performance carried himself very well and took control of the film. He definitely has the potential to go on from this because there is not much to his character in this film.Yeah its ok/average 65% out of 100 or 6.5 out of 10 not as good as I thought it was going to be or actually the film I thought it was going to be. For some reason or another I thought it would be in the mould of a ""Wolf of Wall Street"" or ""I,Tonya"" in terms of style and pace, I have no idea why.

Then it all comes down crashing so fast, I felt like they ran out of time trying to tell the story.

A lot of this is done with the help of the performances, which are all around solid.This movie didn't end up being what I thought it would, somehow again tells the story of someone lead into crime by a inherently broken and downright corrupt system, and unfortunately it's still a major major issue.

59,tigerfish50,Dumb Boy Rick,1,9 October 2018,"The interminable morality tale of 'White Boy Rick' grinds on for almost two miserable hours describing how the teenage son of a fly-by-night gun dealer becomes a bad boy in Detroit's criminal underworld. In common with almost every 'based-on-true-story' movie, fuzziness around crucial plot elements creates the strong suspicion inconvenient facts have been omitted to create a more sympathetic narrative. The script doesn't provide much background to explain Rick's acceptance into a gang of black drug dealers, nor does it reveal much detail about his role as an informant for some dubious FBI detectives. Even after Rick starts his own dealing operation, the story consistently portrays him as an innocent adrift in an ocean of sharks.The dysfunctional relationship between Rick and his father occupies center stage, but is given similarly shallow treatment. The rest of the characters come and go like bit players, scarcely more important than extras, making it impossible to care about any of these lowlifes as they eke out their dismal existence in perpetually freezing Motor City.

Excellent direction, screenplay, costume, cinematography, setting, soundtrack and acting. The entire cast deliver sterling performances. McConaughey continues to impress as a versatile actor bringing life to complex characters. A stellar performance by first timer Merritt makes me look forward to his future work. Both actors immerse themselves in their roles, are superlative and compliment eachother perfectly. The plot is based on real events and revolves around a father and son. The father, Rick Sr. buys and sells guns illegally to support his family which eventually catches the eye of the FBI. The FBI then recruits the father's son Ricky Jr. to go undercover to keep his father from prison. Soon the Ricky Jr. finds himself swept up in the lifestyle and lure of money and becomes an actual drug dealer. The plot is gritty, greasy, corrupt, violent, captivating, duplicit and has a cathartic ending. This film has many powerhouse scenes none better than when Ricky Jr. is visited by his father and Ricky Jr. says, ""Look where I'm at. It's like I'm dead in here. That's the way they want it"".

At one point he says to his son, who can't understand how his father is happy despite being poor and bummed out: ""What can I say I'm a glass is half full kind of guy"".
I actually thought the movie was finished when Wershe held his baby grand daughter in his arms and danced. I guess this is what makes the story a tragedy. It seemed like they could be happy, but the retched poverty, the drugs, the blind alley that is drug dealing, the lost american dream - got the better of them. At least of Rich Wershe Jr. After he is sent to jail, his father keeps his undying good spirit. And at the very end of the movie, when Wershe Jr. himself speaks after being released 30 years later, we recognise his father in his voice. He is finally free.

This begs the question, why did this film even need to be made? Not only is this script loose with facts and important details, it only scraped the surface of a much bigger story, that is still playing out today.
I came across some comments on the White Boy Rick trailer on YouTube to the effect that the FBI did Ricky dirty. It goes to show that this films is confusing people as to what really happened.Mayor Coleman Young, Chief of Police Gil Hill, and their corrupt judges were the ones that did Rick Wershe Jr dirty. They wanted him put away forever, because he knew too much. The FBI has been fighting FOR Rick's release from prison. Coleman and Hill's cronies have been fighting to keep him in prisonUnimaginable corruption and criminality at the highest level of Detroit City Government is the legacy of this saga, yet its a minor detail in this poor filmThe cast is just average.

74,cyifly-2,Very Underwhelming. Wanted To Like it. Tried To Like It. It Just Wouldn't Let Me.,5,24 January 2019,"White Boy Rick started off pretty well. I knew nothing about it and didn't know the background of the 'true story.' After watching the movie, I'm not sure I do now either. The movie had good people in it, but it plodded along pretty slow. When the story seemed to pick up or get interesting, it just dropped right back off and went kind of limp.It left more questions for me after than I had at the beginning, and never really gave any answers. Just when it had the opportunity to wrap up all the questions, it stopped, leaving giant plot holes. Rick was supposed to turn into a drug kingpin. They movie barely even told you how he got into selling the drugs and did NOT ever show him as a 'kingpin.' Barely a low-level street dealer. So how were we supposed to believe he was this 'kingpin?' Here are some more holes you could drive a truck through:1. Why did that kid shoot Rick? He apologizes, then shoots him -- Which makes me think someone sent him. Who? Rick gets out of the hospital and works right in the same circle of people as the guy who shot him. Why wouldn't they want to shoot him again? Why would Rick go back there? Everyone acted like nothing ever happened.2. If he ever did become a 'kingpin,' he was selling in the same area as the guys who shot him earlier. Drug dealers are extremely territorial. Why would the let him cut in on their action? Why would they let him in the door of their hangout? It was almost like they started working for him, but they didn't really elaborate on that. Again, they shot Rick earlier... Why not kill him to stop him from dealing in their spots?3. Who had the 8 kilos of drugs? Where was it? The police busted Rick for it, but never showed he even had it.4. Were we really supposed to feel sorry for a drug dealer going to jail? He begged his dad to let him deal drugs. He started dealing drugs. He got busted for drugs and went to prison for dealing drugs. What's the confusion? The end of the movie turned weird... like we were supposed to hate on the judicial system for putting criminals in jail or over-punishing them. It was like a propaganda piece developed to say the police framed him and his sentence was extremely harsh and we should blame the crooked police and the judicial system and feel sorry for the drug dealer for getting life in prison. I kind of felt sorry for him because the movie did a very poor job in showing how much he was dealing. It hardly showed him distributing at all. But if he was a child 'kingpin,' like the ads and movie posters say, then he belongs in prison.5. What happened to his baby's mother? She only showed up when the baby was born, then was gone for the rest of the movie a minute later.It would have been much easier to watch something else than to walk away with all these unanswered questions.",White Boy Rick

I have seen many ""known' actors who try to force their way into a certain way of carrying themselves: when you are from the street, when you have come up the hard way.

That's Hollywood though, they love to act like they care so much about the little people but they don't, they live in their safe little bubble living for accolades",White Boy Rick
83,boatsfra,Entertaining but Missing Something,5,16 December 2018,"Hello-
Watched WBR last night because I love Matthew M in anything he does. I did read the reviews and have to agree with the middle of the pack here: the movie is entertaining, but the plot goes from side to side which makes for an unpleasant watch. Did it leave a mark in the annals of movies that I have seen? Yes, but only because it's based on a true story. All the actors pour it on but the acting isn't enough to save this movie from being really great. WBR is a good movie and the ending is satisfying, but for two hours it's a mishmash of story lines. I do recommend watching MM in a supporting role here, but don't get too excited.",White Boy Rick
84,ShaeSpencer,"A solid, unique film.",8,16 August 2020,"There are a lot of tropes at play here, and yet the whole thing felt almost entirely unique. I LOVED the choice of having the little kid filling the roles and responsibilities of Brenda's dad. That was pitch perfect.",White Boy Rick

86,tlooknbill,About 30 minutes in I walked out of the theater...,4,26 September 2018,"I guess I just didn't want to see another tough and gritty realistic looking drug related crime drama that reminded me of what it was like living in the '70's for African Americans even though the movie's story takes place in the '80's. I didn't live in those cities back then and never took or sold drugs. There were movies on TV and on the big screen back then that made that life style so darn depressing. And that's exactly what I started feeling within the first 30 minutes. I didn't care about the characters even though they were well acted. Maybe it was the slow pacing of how the characters related to each other. I mean it crawled even up to the Las Vegas scene. I kept asking myself why do I not care? Why don't I find this movie interesting? I didn't want to know what was going to happen next. So why am I watching this?I love movies especially tense and realistic ones like ""White Boy Rick"" but it came across more like your typical socially conscious PBS gritty documentary portraying the dead end lifestyle of a drug culture where there's no hope in sight. It's the same reason I don't watch reality TV about prison life on those investigation detective cable channels.Maybe the movie is just too realistic at recreating a time I'ld like to forget. It is a very well made serious movie but it's just not a story I'm interested in. The trailer saying it's based on a true story I thought was going to be a story that would unfold similar to ""American Hustle"" which I liked. ""White Boy Rick"" unfolded alright but never opened up and 30 minutes waiting for that to happen just wasn't worth my time.",White Boy Rick

88,smithpaulusmc,Just Say Yes,8,15 September 2018,"White Boy Rick (2018)""Just say no"" was the mantra of Nancy Reagan's War on Drugs. But I cannot say no. I cannot say no to White Boy Rick. Andy Weiss' retelling of the Rick Wershe Jr. story is captivating. The script alone bears fantastic potential. It cleverly plays with the audience and dabbles in foreshadowing so pure that the viewer only recognizes it after the movie has concluded. Newcomer Richie Merrit is astounding. He perfectly melts into the decaying Detroit landscape and delivers an honest and emotional performance. Matthew McConaughey further removes himself from his Rom-Com typecast of the early 2000's and once again establishes himself as a chameleon actor. White Boy Rick's greatest strength comes from the power of its characters. If you removed the main plot and were left with only landscape b-footage and the inner workings of the Wershe family, the film would still succeed. The Wershe family is painfully broken. The cold Detroit winters and drug epidemic have played their mark on the city's people. Director Yann Demange captures the bulk of it with apparent ease. The editing is concise, the score is moving, and the story is real. There is nothing more to say.",White Boy Rick

90,AlphaBravoCheesecake,Interesting but Richie Merritt terrible as the lead.,4,17 October 2019,The film for the most part is an interesting story but the story is very slow and Richie Merritt is a horrendous actor who really detracts on the entire premise of the film.

91,iamjacksmoviechannel,Pretty mild telling,4,27 September 2018,"So White Boy Rick wants its thug card as a famous snitch flick but this dude aint Donnie Brasco and he definitely ain't Henry Hill. At least that's what we could take away from the movie, which is just severely undercooked.Taking place in Detroit during the 80's, Rick is a teenager with a really crappy home life for all sorts of personal and economic reasons. His father, played by Mathew McConaughey, is trying to upset AK-47's to make ends meet. The FBI notices this and the connection the two Rick's have to drug dealers in the area and so they recruit the younger Rick to make controlled drug buys for them. Rick will also eventually set out to in the drug game on his own.First what the movie gets right- this is a very hopeless looking Detroit. In fact i'm wondering if i've ever seen a movie where Detroit isn't poverty stricken and boarded up. But yeah, the whole place just seems to have shut down and people, like the main character's sister, are ready to shoot up and get strung out in order to shut down along with it. Other than that the development in this movie is really on a sliding scale in that for the most part it's just not there. So much of it feels like we're fast forwarding over important events and who people are. The drug gang was mostly forgettable. Most of the time you wanna know how they're so connected to some of Detroits more elite people but that never comes. By the time people start getting shot, you're wondering who these people even are. Biggest disappointment is Rick himself. How does he become so connected with the gang so fast? He gets in with them and a couple scenes later he's dressing in fedoras and fur coats like a boss. But yeah there should be so much tension in these sting drug buys and there should be some contemplation from Rick, seeing his sister go through the agony of withdrawal, before he begins his life as a bargain basement Wesley Snipes from New Jack City. But there never is cause those scenes are never even put in the movie. The flick wants us to feel some sympathy for him over the prison sentence he got but we don't even get a sense of how big or for how long his operation was going on for, so it's hard to even assume we're getting the full story here. The character is just very underwhelming. McConaughey doesn't really work either here. This isn't McConaughey driving a Lincoln, it's him selling guns out of the trunk of an old clunker. He seems mostly to be a sleaze ball who ruined his kids, yet the movie every once in a while makes him appear like a loving, concerned father- my guess is so that the actor could have a tearful oscar clip at the end of the movie. 
 
Maybe this movie did have a shot at being something bigger and maybe there were scenes that ended up on the cutting room floor. But the biggest questions coming out of it is just where's the meat? How did this become as meager as it did? If you like this, check out Craig James Review on Youtube for more",White Boy Rick
92,HLEYE,Matthew McConaughey with another outstanding performance,8,11 February 2020,"Two of the main things about movies is the credibility of both the story and the characters. This one is good on both aspects, with Matthew McConaughey, although not the (single) lead character with again an outstanding performance. Others are also well cast, and credible. Strong story about the edge of US society, the guns & drugs & outlaw feeling, the maffia like FBI, and the still remains bizarre notion of the America Dream... which is for over 50 million just another nightmare we left behind over 100 years ago in Europe... still US-ers cling to this non-solidarity, every man for himself mentality believing it is freedom...

Instead, it was much darker than expected, and didn't glamorize drug culture at all, which is a good thing. It was a movie about desperation and family bonds, or lack thereof. I felt they did a great job of realistically capturing Detroit street life.I also enjoyed they gave a rather average looking kid with no experience a chance. How rare is that? He proved he was up to the challenge. His sister also did a great job as a heroin or crack head. This movie was dark and bleak. These people were just struggling to make it through the day, and they didn't always succeed. The government's involvement was perverse, and only added to their problems, as is so often the case. The system often compounds rather than resolves problems.",White Boy Rick

The cross between a crime drama and a family drama worked well. I felt it started well, then they started to rush things from one year to the next .

Brother Richard ""White Boy Rick"" Wershe, Jr. (Richie Merritt) and sister Dawn Wershe (Bel Powley)Potential spoilers belowTime once again for me to invest in a movie trailer.As with Logan Lucky last year and with Jackie in October the year before, I saw a trailer at the start of the summer movie season that stopped me in my tracks. I would, in any other case, resist this as one prefers to mull over a film only after I have seen it. Lately, as a personal experiment, I have opened myself to one or at most two trailers per year and welcome the expectations to which I will soon compare with the actual movie. With its part-time VHS filter and sound effects, coupled with a brilliant remix of the 1977 disco classic ""I Feel Love"" by Donna Summer, the trailer for White Boy Rick prepared me for a gritty and sprawling biographical drama - a crime saga more akin to 1990's GoodFellas than the vulgar excess of 2013's The Wolf of Wall Street.I did not realize these past few months that French-born and British-raised director Yann Demange had worked from a spec screenplay by Adam Weiss and Logan Miller & Noah Miller. Given the unspectacular and largely small-screen output of the writers and that this is merely Demange's sophomore big-screen outing, it does not surprise me that the film falls short of its Scorsese-esque aspirations.The crack epidemic and the War on Drugs rages in mid-1980s Detroit. Richard Wershe, Sr. (Matthew McConaughey), an illegal arms dealer, hopes to open up a video store one day with his truant teenage son Rick Jr. (newcomer Richie Merritt). Soon affectionately known by friends and colleagues as ""White Boy Rick"", Rick Jr. helps sell his dad's wares to local drug-dealing gangs while also yearning for the return of his addict older sister Dawn (an other-worldly Bel Powley). In the midst of this, Rick Jr. is recruited as a temporary informant by FBI Agents Alex Snyder (Jennifer Jason Leigh), Frank Byrd (Rory Cochrane), and Detroit P.D. narcotics officer Mel ""Roach"" Jackson (Brian Tyree Henry). However, as naturally skilled Rick Jr. is as an informant and as quick as he is at learning the lucrative drug-dealing trade, such a career is not meant to last.Giving up guns and drug dealing for the law-abiding quest to start a video store chain? Father and son know deep down that it is all a pipe dream.There is little doubt that director Yann Demange succeeds with White Boy Rick in making a definitive dramatization of its titular real-life figure. The movie still leaves more to be desired. White Boy Rick makes its first mistake by throwing its audience into the middle of Rick Jr.'s story, with brief and on-the-move character introductions. This can work for most other stories, though it does not suffice for biographical tales. After all, the primary point of that subgenre is to get at the heart of their subjects. This would involve more time settings than most actors would struggle to handle in a convincing way without the aid of a great makeup and hairstyling department.That does not deny White Boy Rick from showcasing any great performances. In his debut role, Richie Merritt portrays Rick Jr. for almost four straight years. At his side, veteran Matthew McConaughey does likewise as Rick Sr.. After divorcing his wife and failing so far to protect his daughter from crack addiction, Rick Sr. toils as a single father and does his best to stop his son from ending up worse. Blowing everyone else out of the water, however, is Bel Powley as Dawn Wershe. Coming off her breakthrough role in 2015's The Diary of a Teenage Girl, Ms. Powley transforms herself into such a shell of a young woman that few would realize that the actress is not a Detroit teenager, but rather a 26-year-old British starlet.Weiss and the Logan brothers' screenplay prevents me from writing similar praises for the rest of the cast. It is almost laughable how relative big-screen newcomers Jonathan Majors, RJ Cyler (the standout in last year's Power Rangers, which I wrote about here), Taylour Paige, and their fellow black actors largely get set aside shortly after the midpoint. Worse yet, they only participate in cursory development scenes beforehand. Why bother having longtime screen veterans Bruce Dern and Piper Laurie make passing appearances as Rick Jr.'s senile grandparents? Lastly, the script denies prolific British character actor Eddie Marsan a bigger role in White Boy Rick's second half. These are all supporting performances that could have brought color to a 2 1/2-hour-plus portrait of Rick Jr.. The inexperience of director Demange and the screenwriters constrains the two-hour portrait to just one or two hues.Perhaps that is why White Boy Rick leaves me wanting more. Richard Wershe, Jr.'s story demands an unabridged and exhausting commitment, perhaps a miniseries, rather than a somewhat truncated biodrama that sacrifices a fleshed-out supporting cast. White Boy Rick wisely strays from glorifying Rick Jr.'s life of crime, government-sponsored or not. Yet much of its runtime is a fairly high plain that trends downward over two hours, puttering to sea level by the time the end credits arrive. Contrast that with the trailer, in which ""I Feel Love"" builds anticipation with explosive and heart-pumping excitement.Perhaps director Demange and writers Weiss and the Logan brothers should take inspiration henceforth from the former trajectory, rather than the latter.(Parental Note: White Boy Rick has been rated R by the MPAA ""for language throughout, drug content, violence, some sexual references, and brief nudity"". It has also been rated 15 by the BBFC for ""strong language, violence,"" and ""drug misuse and references"" and rated L (Limited adult audience) by the Catholic News Service for containing ""some gory violence, benignly viewed adultery, drug use, brief rear and upper female nudity, frequent profanities and a few milder oaths, and pervasive rough and crude language."")R.N.B.",White Boy Rick

The acting and script to this movie are on another level. The movie takes the time to develop the characters and then take you on the journey with them.Unlike to many movies today where they TELL you who someone is, this movie takes the time to SHOW you who someone is. This develops and attachment to the characters and you dive deeper into their story. This movie did not have a dull moment for me and I have recommended it to a bunch of friends/family already.

Very realistic, a well done period film of Detroit in the 80's which unfortunately hasn't changed much. I love the acting of Matthew McConaughey and once again he doesn't disappoint. The back story is gangs, violence, and drugs and the temptation of quick money but, there is much more, it's trappings and ultimate failures. A thoughtful movie I enjoyed.

Its a movie that starts off a little slow but the speed starts to pick up and it stays steady. Its not the most ideal story but its one that when you watch it you start to question why things happen the way they do. Why pick from the lower level families but then that's typical. The trailer tells enough of the story that you get the gist of it. The FBI essentially picks up and recruits the kid that turns to be the youngest informant. They get what they need and then done. But then it is Detroit back then and it hasn't been painted in a nice picture. Now is it worth watching a second time? That's most likely a no unless you have nothing else to do. Its good for that first viewing but beyond that you'll be better off spending your money on something else.,White Boy Rick

It's an interesting storyline about Rick and his journey from raising himself and supporting his poor family. I feel that this movie sets a positive viewpoint on drug sellers from low socioeconomic family and in what way they are both deserved and undeserved the reputation as criminals for selling drugs. They were born with less opportunities than others when they are expected to be treated as people with opportunities. That unrealistic boundaries of expectations lead them to seek for the life as people with privilege. Then, they are stuck with the consequences.

115,AustinSober,"Well-made, but by-the-numbers true crime story",6,22 November 2018,"I thought ""White Boy Rick"" was okay. McConaughey was excellent as always and the new kid on the block Richie Merritt was believable in his role, even if the character/person he is playing borderlines on ""annoying punk"" quite often. The film also does a great job establishing a poverty-stricken urban environment. (I can't really speak for the reality that is Detriot...but I never hear good things). From the dimly, orange-lit streets covered in faint layers of snow to some very unpleasant, ghetto housing, the feeling of being on the wrong side of the tracks is very apparent. Aside from that, the story is nothing special. Rick isn't really an interesting character, nor is his story as epic as the trailer made it out to be. He sells drugs and parties and then some bad things happen. If you have seen any period based true crime drama, then you have seen this all before. And like many films in this sub-genre, it often lacks any real focus, jumping from time to time and from event to event. This lack of focus makes the investment in Rick's story not as strong as it begs to be, especially in regards to supporting characters. They all just sorta fade into the background. The most emotional moment is actually at the end...the VERY end. That and perhaps a scene where Rick and his dad try to get Rick's sister out of the life of being a junkie...all while Rick sells drugs anyway. ""White Boy Rick"" is a well-made film, but not one I see sticking out from others in the genre. Worth one viewing down the line for those interested in its true story roots.

Overall, the movie had great pacing, storytelling and writing, the only gripe I have with it is that it seemed to end on a sudden note, right when the story was getting to the best pace. Little was put into the ending and if they were to go into the ending more, talking about his life once arrested and had spent time in prison, I think that the movie would of wrapped up better.
The 80s seemed to represented accurately in the movie, with the vehicles, music and clothing worn by the actors. That helped put the audience, including myself, in the world of 1980s Detroit.

The story progress well adding a punch of drama one after the other until we get the conclusion of his life. I like the set design a lot. The music, the city, the clothes haircut and all that.

I was really expecting a lot more with all the great actors on the roster.I think most of the 29 mil that was spent on the movie was to pay that cast because it seemed like a B movie. I mean I realize it was in the eighties, but come on I still want to feel like it was made in this century.The historical data of this movie is off as well. It really could have made for an amazing movie. Unfortunately it just seemed like it was pieced together and thrown on a reel.",White Boy Rick
127,baztopher,Over hyped,4,18 December 2018,"Slow, unlikable characters, struggling to think why someone would want to make a film about this guy's story, it's not like he wasn't a criminal, and his father, also a criminal who tries to make right decisions for him which end up not being very favorable for Rick.Acting was good and cinematography was great but that's the only thing that saves this from getting a lower vote.",White Boy Rick

I was intrigued to find from the very beginning the exposition and plot brought my attention straight to the screen.

Hated the ending, but it was the ending I could expect watching white boy rick from beginning to end.",White Boy Rick
130,mattheddy,Good film,7,8 September 2019,I thought this movie was pretty good. I suppose because I can kind of relate to it. A family stuck in poverty and not a whole lot of options to make it out. Young Rick stuck to what he knew to try and provide for his family. This film shows you how govt agencies will use people to get what they need and discard them. It was a good story. I hadn't heard of Rick Wershe prior to this film. Made me look into his story. There a so many Americans affected by the War on drugs and this movie is a good peak inside that world.,White Boy Rick

Matthew McConaughey (in an excellent, Oscar-worthy performance) plays the boy's father.The film is consistently interesting and has excellent 1980's atmosphere. Well worth watching.

136,dpb0402,Heartbreaking,10,21 September 2018,"White Boy Rick differs in lots of ways from most gangster style films of today for one reason. It's mainly centered as the name would imply around white people. This is a movie about a white kid in Detroit who is going through a life just as hard as any black child in any other film like this about crime and gangsters. The cast of this movie is incredible. As someone who comes from a broken family it is very spot on with the way particular story threads work out. These actors and actresses were all cast for good reason. They look the part of white trash, play the part of white trash, and make you feel like you're watching a white trash family fall apart.This is NOT a feel good movie. I feel like most of these bad reviewers went in expecting a movie about how he was caught early and the bulk of the movie would be him fighting the system. This is not the case. I believe that's why the film is struggling. If you enjoy hard to stomach stories of loss and betrayal this movie is for you.",White Boy Rick

138,collmarsch,Bite Size review,7,23 September 2018,"JUDGEment: White Boy Rick7/10One of the few times IMDb review aggregate is spot on with how I feel. This movie is very similar to Blow with Johnny Depp and other movies this style. The story is engaging, the characters are very well acted. The main complaint I have is that the story jumps around a lot. The movie is oddly edited and I feel that it sets up acts of the movie, goes to deliver and then it jumps away to another topic. It just felt odd watching the movie. I feel that this movie if it had more time to develop it would have been fine. Reaching back the the character acting, the main three, McConaughey, Merritt, Powley all play very strong roles and the acting was fantastic. Should you see this in theaters? I don't know. I thought it was worth seeing but I feel that there are better movies to see in theaters right now. TL;DR: Story was engaging, Characters were acted superbly, editing was weird. If you want to see this, go see it. If you're on the fence, wait and see something else like Searching and catch this in Redbox.",White Boy Rick

140,31Byrnsey,Good. Could've been great.,6,17 November 2020,"I went into this having never heard of Rick Wersche Jr or his story of rise from youth arms dealer to drugs kingpin.It's an intriguing story. White Boy Rick holds your attention because you are under the premise that you'll get into the detail of the 'how?'. But it never really delivers that, which is a shame as I think, with an over two hour run time, it had the opportunity. I was longing for more insight into the FBI's involvement and manipulation of Rick. How did he achieve the rise within the drug scene? And to what level did he reach? Local dealer? Detroit Kingpin? Some questions left frustratingly unanswered.McConaughey and Merritt are great in their roles. They did well to portray the dysfunctional yet underlying closeness of the unconventional father/son relationship.Ultimately, it's a good watch. There are some decent scenes and cinematography. But genuinely believe in the hands of a Scorsese, White Boy Rick could've been turned into a great. It just lacks the depth required to get to that level.",White Boy Rick

Ten minutes into the movie you have a clear idea that you are watching the story of the two of most idiotic people on the planet. A loser father and his troubled harebrained teenage son. You are so repulsed by their idiocy that you stop feeling any sympathy for them. Ricky boy was supposed to be a kingpin but he was not even good at dealing drugs, he was not good at anything actually. He doesn't even have an interesting personality. His fellow drug dealers were lot more interesting and charismatic. Nothing else matters after that. Great thing about this teenage boy who was sentenced to life without parole is that his friends and family and especially his young daughter were spared of this idiot in their lives.

I hadn't read up on this story, because I wanted to watch the movie not knowing any details. I was pleasantly surprised. This movie was not what I was expecting. I went in thinking it would be a Pablo Escobar kinda movie, but it was not. It's about a teenager trying to figure out how to survive living in a low income part of Detroit. It was heart wrenching, and even had some very funny parts. It also had some parts that made you shake your head and say, ""what is he thinking?"" In my opinion, it's definitely worth the watch. Also, I was completely blown away by Richie Merritt's performance. Especially since this was the first time he's acted, ever.",White Boy Rick
152,jenniferanneshelley,Pretty Close to the Real Story!,9,19 December 2018,"From what I've read about the real story of Richard Wershe, Jr., the movie comes pretty close! It was interesting to see how the police so easily used a 14 year old boy who was running guns for his father to get involved with well known drug dealers that he previously had no interest in. Just when Rick knew all about the drug trade, the FBI turned their backs on him. They taught him all the cocaine game and how to be a major player, he didn't learn it from the streets! Being such a young man and wanting the money, of course he is going to sell the drugs.The FBI essentially led to his arrest & conviction at just 17 years old.",White Boy Rick

I had never heard of him but man he can act with the best. White Boy Rick was a surprisingly powerful movie with a few good laughs and several very emotional scenes that were acted perfectly, and the meaning behind this movie hits you hard. The fact this was overlooked for any Oscars proves once again the critics don't know a good movie with a powerful message when they see one. My opinion, it's one of the best movies of 2018 and should have been nominated for it along with best actor and supporting actor. And for the 80s music fans, this has an awesome soundtrack that fits the movie perfectly.",White Boy Rick

It has everything you want : the story comes from a true one and will let you think a lot on your own even after the movie ends.
The cinematography is beautiful, Max Richter for the music lets you speechless and thinking what would have been your call if you were at the place of white boy Rick...
Mc Conaughey shows one more time that he is one of the best actor of this last 10 years, a classic top of the class Mc Conaughey In this movie.

We never see any arrest or other outcome of the operation, and the kid gets to keep the money, which is thousands of 1984 dollars. This relationship mysteriously disappears, and the kid eventually goes into drug marketing for real. Also the kid appears suddenly in Las Vegas -- or is it Vegas, as opposed to some legalized gambling casino near his home (Somewhere near the end someone mentions that it was, in fact, Vegas)? How did he get there? Why? How did his family not ask where he'd been? Is the FBI undercover thing still in the picture? The picture finally does run its course -- downhill -- according to the allegedly true story on which it is based. Was there a mission to this? Did the FBI lie to him or exploit him wrongfully? Were the parents and grandparents too corrupt, or blindsided by their own greed, to place some control over him? Maybe, but the film makes no effort to state its mission, or to have the characters reveal their true natures by any useful dialogue. I suppose that someday a Director's Cut version will be released on DVD, revealing whatever parts of the story were hacked away to get the running time down to somewhere near two hours -- but public demand will probably never rise to such a level.",White Boy Rick

Instead, we got uninspired sad piano, annoying shaky cam, and horrible writing (which also causes bad acting). Matthew McConaughey was absolutely amazing though and his performance was better than any other aspect of this movie.I read up on white boy rick and wow is his life incredibly heartbreaking and this movie does not do it justice.

174,OmegaManGodmode,White Boy Rick is an amazing gangster film!,10,28 May 2019,"If you are in the mood for the likes of Casino, Goodfellas and 80s nostalgia, you will dig this biopic. It also kinda had a Straight Outta Compton feel.Yes. It is yet another gangster film. But there are nuances to it. I mean if you are in the mood for a bleak, dreary snowcast Detroit machine-like era where crime and poverty interplays with the general outlook, weltenschaung and weather then sure you will have another yet different feeling.It IS supposed to be slow. It is not a thriller. It is a crime drama. It is meant to be experienced after your typical American date with butter popcorn in hand to unwind the evening and relax.As for the performance, I will just say this. McHaughney -formerly Sexiest Man Alive-manages to transform a scruffy gun seller in an his unique, honey-delight, soothing suave accent to a charming man which only you can just pass out so naturally almost as to hand-wave the performance, where you don't see the acting. After Rick got shot, one of the powerful moment was a father's dilemma holding a gun in hand whether to take out his son's assailant.And yes of course much has been seen in the scene carrying the junkie daughter out of dimly lit typical dilapidated location.The opening was superb. Loved the jargon and syntax. Only glimmer of hope was the recovering addict - Dawn but other than that the ending is another typical dreary reminder that not all life has a happy ending.Loved the City-of-Angel vibe and the scenario of exchange between the black kids and Rick. For once- thank GOD! - it wasn't about race but a mutual bond of youth who are agreeingly motivated by the power of greed, wealth and the power to call the shots. As the common touch of shooting the birds and havin' a good time shows that we humans are far tied in our roots in our unique and common paradigm than just our plain blanche and bland race.Which is perhaps ironic given the moniker in the title!",White Boy Rick

I was upset cuz I was really excited 2 see it cuz I kno alot about the true story of white boy rick. This movie coulda been sooooooooo much better. BUT thats just MY opinion.,White Boy Rick
192,macinasent,Good but not Great Movie,8,25 September 2018,"I went to see this with an open mind as the reviews were mixed. I actually enjoyed the movie. Yes, some parts were slow but this is not Infinity Wars people (the Marvel generation wants an explosion or murder every 2 minutes). I actually found the dad's character as the most believable. His struggles in life and poor decision making was the actual catalyst for most of the stuff that went on. I say go see it for yourself. May not be a date movie but definitely a guy movie for sure.",White Boy Rick
193,billyduaneblanton,I Was Engaged The Whole Time,9,15 September 2018,"I loved the movie and performances from the entire cast. There were a few awkward points in it, but I never lost interest in the film. Such an interesting story and I'm glad I got to learn all about it. My only nitpick is the ending albeit, original, was very flat. I feel like it could've been executed better.",White Boy Rick

195,dcraig-07462,Disappointing,3,6 September 2018,I wanted to like this film because I knew the true story. But it missed for me. Couldn't resonate with the actor chosen to play the kid.,White Boy Rick
196,jamesptierney,Great Flick But Not For Idealists,10,3 September 2018,"The ironies in drug enforcement provide the sub-text for this excellent film. The FBI uses a 15-year-old kid as an informant to make arrests and seize cocaine brought into this country with the help of the Detroit PD and members of the mayor's family. Rick is merely a pawn in the chessboard of life in which he was destined to either get killed or go to jail. Because I saw the trailer, I was not surprised by the ending, But that's what attracted me in the first place. Enjoy!",White Boy Rick
197,kenklincko,Polluted example,1,14 September 2018,"This movie is a polluted example to our youth,, glorifying guns drugs and violence is their only way ,, somehow ??? people can't get enough",White Boy Rick
198,sparky_blondie,Not to impressed,4,17 September 2018,"Was a great heart warming story, but it drag with a slow moving snale like view.. where was the excitement, where was the trill of the adventure, it was a cruel story of one man whom ended up lost, because of greed.",White Boy Rick
199,billgamble,Not your typical drug dealer movie.,7,18 September 2018,I enjoyed most of this film. There were a few slow parts and its just as much a family drama as it is a crime/action flick. I thought newcomer Richie Merritt did a good job. He is likable and I found my self rooting for him throughout the movie. The setting of the film is early to mid 80's Detroit when factories are closing and the city is starting to spiral downward. This is a bit depressing but the city itself is kind of a character in the movie because of this. You understand why young men turn to a life of crime when there are no other ways to make a living. White Boy Rick was more a victim of his surroundings and environment than anything else. I can't recommend that you sprain an ankle running out to see WBR but it is worth seeing.,White Boy Rick
200,liliacuellar,Worth paying to see,10,23 September 2018,"Although its not what I expected it's what i needed to see, I was expecting one thing and got something completely different. Can we give a shout out to the person responsible for the music! Great cast underrated movie I wouldn't be surprised if this doesn't do well since it's rarely playing in theaters only one showing per theatre in a county . Not much playing time. none the less I would see it again.",White Boy Rick
201,bluemaxximus,Slow,2,27 September 2018,"It takes a long time for anything to happen and when it does, I didnt feel any connection to the characters involved.",White Boy Rick
202,americanaviator,Overrated,3,30 September 2018,"Good acting and costumes, but that's about it. Highlight of the movie, they boy gets laid and goes home and smells his finger. That's the most exciting, yet only classic thing in the movie.Overall just a depressing movie, that dragged on. In order to really get a true story out of this, a proper and well researched documentary would have been far more beneficial. The whole ""gangster"" persona was overplayed, just tell the story of what really happened.At the end of the movie I was just depressed and disappointed I wasted $7 and nearly 2hrs of my time. Never again.",White Boy Rick
203,lorenzocarr-05374,Best Movie,5,1 October 2018,White Boy RICK great movie don't no how one could wanna see Kevin Hart than not to see what really goes on in world today!!!! Real Deal !!!💯💯💯,White Boy Rick
204,brownachante,Good Movie,8,15 October 2018,"I found White Boy Rick to be very exciting but yet sad. Based on true story of Rick Wershe Jr. Shows the come up of a young boy who grows to the kingpin in Detroit. If you are into gangster films, you would be very intrigued by this film. Rick was introduced to drugs at a very young age. Because his dad had gone into some trouble into with police, rick was introduced to drugs from the federal governments. This movie does a good job of showing how corrupt cops and the government are. Rick had to sell for the government to keep is dad out of jail. Rick got involved with the wrong people. White Boy Rick does an amazing job with showing the effects of gangs taking over teenagers' life. They started to introduce rick to things had never seen before, so he became very money hungry. 
 This movie reminds me a lot of many other movies but this one is more realistic because this movie was based on a true story. White Boy Rick does a great job of showing how Rick was able to come up from having nothing to everything. Although I believe they could've added more detail in key events of his life. They could've shown more of the work of that the feds had him do, they would show him asking but not doing the actual act. I believe could have been way better. The ending feels super rushed. It seems as if they wanted the movie to be over but there was so much more the audience needed to know. The customs and acting were spot on in this film. The casting look very much likes the actual people. I feel as if it was an accurate depiction of Detroit at the time. After watching this movie, it leaves you to want to learn more. They do a very good job in showing how it was during that time.
 If I had to rate this movie, I would give this movie an 8.5/10. The movie was an emotional rollercoaster, most of the movie is excited, although it does have some slow parts. Somethings could have been left of this movie and more important key information could have been added into the film. The movie had some very sad moments. The ending was very shocking and could've been better. Overall the movie was good but could have been better. I would recommend this movie anyone who likes this genre of movies. I would watch this move again to catch things I've might've missed the first time.",White Boy Rick
205,cimtex-85978,Everything We Hate in a Movie,1,27 December 2018,"Friends treated us to a high end theater, not realizing that this was a horrible film. After the first five minutes we wanted to walk out, but couldn't be rude to them. Although a true story, it was extremely unpleasant and upsetting. We avoid the new movies that leave nothing to the imagination: the graphic violence, sex, vulgar language and unappealing choice of actors. We are devoted fans of the old movies on TCM. Fantom Events shows the classics at theaters; browse their website to find truly great movies. Don't waste your time and money on white boy rick.",White Boy Rick
206,shiska420,"Good movie, but hard to believe when major facts are wrong.",6,27 December 2018,"I enjoy true stories as do most watchers and I also enjoyed watching White Boy Rick as a fiction. As soon as a movie based in 1984 mentioned buying/selling/shooting a .40 cal gun, I knew it was a made up story... If a movie is a true story, shouldn't it only contains truth and facts? The fact that White Boy Rick is even holding a .40 cal makes this movie now science fiction. He's from the future. Had they said it was a Bren Ten, then yea, it would have been believable. Because the 10mm was invented in 1983, it could have been around. A .40 caliber hand gun round was not invented until 1990. So if White Boy Rick and his dad were FFL dealers. They were buying and selling guns that had not yet been invented. At this point in the movie I knew I could get up and get some pop corn. Because if the facts were not right on the simple things that anyone can check, how am I to believe the rest of the movie is truthful? A .40 cal in 1983, ha. The FBI would have liked that. Good entertainment.",White Boy Rick
207,jellybean-10701,Rented a copy and was suprised,8,5 January 2019,Okay so I.walked out of the Redbox not knowing what to think when I picked this out but wow was I ever happy with my choice I had a rush of action a little humor and even sadness but I say I recommend picking up a copy,White Boy Rick
208,ruthkremer,It was never meant as a typical gangster movie...,10,9 January 2019,"First of all: Don't look at the poor ratings of this film and go see the movie.Last night I saw the movie and then went to IMDB to check the reviews. I go to theatres every week, actually have a background in film and I try to stay away from reviews on forehand so I can form an honest opinion. But afterwards I always check the ratings. The ratings of White Boy Rick disappoint me. And for the first time in so many years watching movies I felt like creating an imdb account and rate this movie because of the unfair low ratings.
I don't know how people missed that in the trailer, but for me White Boy Rick was never just a gangster movie. It is actually not a gangster movie at all, it is a strong family drama in the Detroit subs. It is about struggling in life, poor decision making and temptations. About surviving life itself in Detroit subs. Heart wrenching, true and very strong and believable acting; not only of Matthew McConnaughey who was as strong as in Dallas Buyers Club but also for young Ricky played by Richie Merritt. The fierceness of a 14 year old boy that fights for his father and sister as taking over the providing source role but is also just a kid as well. Well done!Definitely worth the watch. Its dramatic, its fierce, it will make you laugh but also cry at the end as well (seriously, the whole theatre was quiet and even I had to swallow a tear big time). I could really feel the sadness of that kid longing for home and family but facing a 20 year sentence at 17.Coming to the ending of the film I felt they could have done more with the FBI part and pointing out the system before actually ending the movie. I am rating this movie with a 10. Because I want to upgrade the ratings as much as I can. From my professional opinion I would rate it a big 8.",White Boy Rick
209,mcmanuscourtneyl,White Boy Rick,9,14 January 2019,A movie I could sit and watch straight from beginning to end again and again. Alot better then expected and based on true story.,White Boy Rick
