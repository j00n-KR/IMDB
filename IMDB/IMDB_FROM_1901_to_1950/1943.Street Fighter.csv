0,MartinHafer,"In this case, perhaps IMDB was being too kind!",2,23 February 2019,"""Street Fighter"" is a bad film according to nearly everyone...though it managed to make a ton of money at the box office. It currently has a pitiful score of 3.9 and is #80 on IMDB's infamous Bottom 100...the 100 worstrated major release films of all time. It's not surprising, as movies based on videogames stink...with pictures like ""Super Mario Brothers"", ""BloodRayne"" and ""Mortal Kombat: Annihiliation"" also on this list of terrible films. And, that is why I decided to watch the film...to get a good laugh. But is it really THAT bad??The games Street Fighter and Mortal Kombat are very similar...side-scrolling fighting games. The biggest difference is that Mortal Kombat was a bit bloodier...otherwise the two had a lot of similarities. In fact, Jean Claude Van Damme had his choice, as he was offered the lead in both films at the same time by competing studios! Either way, he was screwed!In this particular movie, a coalition of armed forces have invaded some fictitious country in order to oust a maniac, General Bison (Raul Julia), from control. The leader of the coalition forces is Colonel Guile (Van Damme) and you know sooner or later they're going to have a boss battle and good will ultimately triumph over evil. But, in between, there would be prison escapes, other baddie fights, and well, a LOT of talking!So is it bad? Heck yeah! But it might not be for the reason you think. While I am not a huge Jean Claude Van Damme fan, he is not the problem with the movie. Sure, he's wooden...but that's all the writers gave him in the script and they didn't give him enough time doing what he does best...fight. No, the reasons it's a terrible film are twofold. First, the picture looks too much like a cartoon. Cartoony uniforms, cartoony and one dimensional baddies and it just looked cheap and dumb...so although the maniacal General is supposed to be a threat to the world, he comes off more like a villain from a Popeye cartoon! And, the biggest problem with the film was Raul Julia. It's sad, since he could be an amazing actor and it was his final film before dying so young...but he was simply terrible, overacting and chewing up scenery right and left and the film focused almost exclusively on his dumb character and not enough on the hero. Overall, a mess of a film that would make adults bored and children, well, despite it being a 'nice' Van Damme film it's still awfully violent and I wouldn't even let most kids watch it. A terrible and misguided film which earns a 2 simply because there really are a few films out there that are worse!",Street Fighter
1,TheLittleSongbird,One of the biggest examples of video games not translating well to film,3,26 June 2016,"While there are exceptions, video games have had and still do have a dubious track record when adapted to film.'Street Fighter' is one such example. It is a terrible adaptation of the video game series, and is not a good film at all on its own terms (was actually familiar with the film before being familiar with the games, so even with no knowledge of the video game series it still manages to be bad).It can be argued that other video game film adaptations do a worse job making it clear what it's trying to be and what the target audience it's trying to primarily aim to, because from the get go it is clear what 'Street Fighter's' target audience is and that it's not meant to be serious or profound. That doesn't stop it from having a lot of things done wrong and from being one of the cheaper-looking video game film adaptations.The best thing about it is absolutely Raul Julia. As a result of dying from stomach cancer (he would die a few months later, but of stroke complications), Julia does look gaunt and frail which makes one panic as to whether he would cope with the demands of playing the larger-than-life dictator. Any concerns are obliterated, because he is the one actor who seems to know what sort of film he's in and how to fit in well with the tone, he goes for it full-throttle (he may look gaunt and frail, but he certainly doesn't act it) and makes for one hugely entertaining and sometimes menacing, but always memorable, villain.Ming Na Wen is also not too bad, playing her character with allure and dignity. Sadly the character is badly underwritten so she doesn't shine quite as much.Jean Claude Van Damme however is very wooden in a role that requires more heroism than what he gave, some of his line delivery sounds awkward and lacking in clarity too. Kylie Minogue's sexiness is not enough to disguises her limitations as an actress, complete with a non-existent accent and a fatefully ill-matched pairing with Van Damme with no obvious spark or chemistry. The rest of the cast struggle to bring believability or personality to underwritten and weirdly distorted characters, where the names are there but almost like thrown in into a completely different film with personalities that don't have what makes them so special in the first place or so far removed from before.Cheap-looking production values are also present with haphazard editing, tacky set design, inappropriately natty costumes and just everything looking and feeling rushed. The music consists of generic and repetitive rap that feels misplaced and out-of-place, and very under-powered orchestral scoring with compressed sound mixing. The action is both overblown and under-rehearsed, the nods to the fight moves in the games looking and feeling clumsily fitted in. The script is childish, with an overuse of one-liners and jokes that often jar with the mood or (apart from the odd amusing one from particularly Bison) are too intelligence-insultingly stupid to be a mild chuckle.Despite having a crisp, buoyant energy, the storytelling is hectic and confused with many things with potential but left under-explored and has a cobbled together feel, where the dropping of characters' names and the games' fight moves feel randomly thrown in. People will say that one shouldn't take it seriously, the thing is though to anybody who says it that those who criticise it for being silly and cheesy and all that actually are aware of what the film is trying to be and how to judge it. The argument is that we feel that 'Street Fighter' goes overboard in the silliness and stupidity, leaving room for little else, that it becomes exhausting, the games were silly but also fun and didn't forget to treat the audience with respect. Like it or not that is actually an understandable criticism, and one this reviewer shares.All in all, has a couple of bright spots, the biggest one being Julia, but it really is one of the biggest examples of video games not adapting well to film. 3/10 Bethany Cox",Street Fighter
2,Leofwine_draca,Entertainingly bad,4,1 January 2017,"This cheesy movie is based on a video game and is often unintentionally hilarious. A totally wooden cast battle heroically with absurd dialogue to often amusing effect. The budget here has been totally blown on the scenery, special effects, and costumes (which admittedly look very nice, especially the natty blue soldier uniforms which Van Damme and his cohorts wear), so it 's all very colourful and visually stimulating. Unfortunately those expecting a serious film will be extremely disappointed as this movie is aimed squarely at children, never for once engaging the brain. The loose plot simply has loads of different characters moving from one situation to another and fighting a lot of the time. Sounds confusing? It is. We're talking bombastic here, not subtle.I actually like Van Damme's performance in this film. It's obvious that it's supposed to be a light, fluffy film yet he never once breaks into a grin, instead being commendably straight-faced. The only thing I didn't like was his red hair! Here he gets lots of tacky one-liners which even Schwarzenegger would refuse to speak, and they're often funny because they're so cheesy (""Only somebody out of their mind could attack Bison's island by boat."" ""That's good, because General Bison has driven me insane"").There are a few familiar (and sometimes out-of-place) faces in an otherwise unfamiliar cast (picked solely for their physiques more than anything else, it seems, especially the lame Bruce Lee wannabe and the Marc Singer-lookalike who play Ken and Ryu). Raul Julia has a ball playing the evil dictator, and it was the actor's last film, as you can tell by the star's gaunt, pale appearance. The film is actually dedicated to him as well. A lot of people have commented on what a bad film it was to bow out on, but as I said, Julia looks like he's having fun in his over the top, overtly villainous role so kudos to him. Simon Callow pops up as a stuffy official for no particular reason and Kylie Minogue's role is still a mystery: her acting abilities are non existent, she has about two expressions and thankfully she's hardly in it.The action when it comes is supremely stylised and over the top, as you would expect. Characters battle it out for ages and do all sorts of quick, physically-impossible moves. The film loses some credibility when introducing the Blanka character - in the computer game a fearsome green monster, in the film a laughably poor and shoddy rubber suit which looks worse than the Incredible Hulk did. They do make up for things by having a hilarious ending battle between Van Damme and Julia, where dictator Bison gets hover boots and shoots Van Damme with lightning from his hands, RETURN OF THE JEDI style. Movie buffs will also notice a high number of references and in-jokes, some surprisingly subtle, some blatant (Godzilla-like fighting as two men flatten a model city). STREET FIGHTER is a really bad film, yes, but it's entertaining with it, and never boring. All right if you're in a silly, affable mood.",Street Fighter
3,SnoopyStyle,bad kind of video game movie,2,4 February 2016,"In the southeast Asian nation of Shadaloo, military dictator General Bison (Raul Julia) are holding hostages and battling the forces of the Allied Nations led by Colonel Guile (Jean-Claude Van Damme). Guile's friend Blanka is one of the captured soldier who Bison turns into a mutant. Ryu Hoshi and Ken Masters get into trouble dealing with criminal Viktor Sagat (Wes Studi). They are all arrested by Guile. Ryu and Ken are recruited by Guile and they stage an escape for Sagat. They even fake killing Guile. Reporter Chun-Li (Ming-Na) discovers the truth.The story is a mess trying to weave together all these game characters. It is sad to see Raul Julia in this and it's obvious after the fact that the man was sick. To his credit, he put in plenty of effort but the man looks sickly. The movie looks bad and silly. This grand mess is not compelling and all the action in the world can't save it. It's not even so bad that it's fun.",Street Fighter
4,kosmasp,Lost in Fight-slation,6,15 May 2021,"A movie adaptation of a video game ... back in the 90s many producers thought it'd be a good idea. And while this came before Mortal Kombat, it also came quite toothless. Yes Street Fighter the game never was as violent as Mortal Kombat ... but considering it is about fighting ... there is almost none going on for most of the time.Now if you delve into the making of or the general history of the movie, you will find out that due to many reasons (school shooting being one of them if I'm not mistaken), the movie had to be trimmed down. So there was more action and more fighting ... which all seems to be lost (the deleted scenes do not offer anything in that department).As it is, the movie apparently only got a PG13 rating because they added a curse word in post. So after all the trimming, the movie would have been a G rating or something like that ... something the target audience wouldn't have wanted to see. Which as it seems became true in a sense anyway ... while it did make 90 million worldwide, the movie is not considered that much of a success. The story of the making of the movie is much more infamous ... especially with the big name attached to it (van Damme) and it being the last movie Raul Julia did - he died way too soon from illness. Not that you could tell by watching the movie - his performance is impeccable.Van Damme came from a Timecop all time high ... something that in retrospect seems to be the pinacle of his career ... almost a shame, because even while many claim he can't act, the matter of fact is that he actually can. I would go on to compare him with Seagal, but that is not real a tough challenge for any individual - to show more emotion that Seagal that is. That aside in this movie a side character is the one that shines through that you may not expect! It is the one played by Andrew Bryniarski! He later moved on to become one of the Leatherfaces ... but here he showed his comedic chops ... he steals almost every scene he is involved in. And he might be the closest to the video game character! Having said all that, the movie is more than flawed and yet it was quite fun to rewatch the camp quality of it ... especially with all the acting talent involved! It could've been a lot better ... it could've been a lot worse too though ...",Street Fighter
5,gavin6942,Pure 1990s Cheese,6,14 June 2013,"Colonel William Guile (Jean-Claude VanDamme) and various other martial arts heroes fight against the tyranny of Dictator M. Bison (Raul Julia) and his cohorts.Who else (besides this film's director and producers) can picture Kylie Minogue as a martial artist in the military?? Not I. Apparently they thought she had the right look to be Cammy. And I guess she does. With some of the others (Dhalsim) they did not even try to stick to the video game.This is generally considered a terrible movie. And, indeed, it is a terrible movie. But give them credit for what they were trying to do -- take a game with no plot and construct a narrative out of it, utilizing several characters in a coherent way. As silly as the result might be, it worked. Perhaps ""Mortal Kombat"" is the better film, but this still beats the heck out of the ""Mario Bros"" movie... what was going on there?",Street Fighter
6,Quinoa1984,is it not good? in the words of M. Bison: OF COURSE! but it's not the worst,4,18 March 2009,"One could say simply this: at least it's not Paul Anderson's Resident Evil, right? The 1994 Street Fighter is a movie anyone who grew up in the 80s (or maybe even the 70s) have seen at least once, either against their will kicking and screaming or with a bunch of friends laughing and yucking it up - or maybe even legitimate die-hard fans of the video-game, one of the definitive fighting games. It may have been impossible for there to ever be a good Street Fighter movie (and lets not kid ourselves, this is far from the Sonny Chiba Street Fighter in terms of just the fights themselves let alone the story), but perhaps we got the Street Fighter we deserved. It's colorful, crazy, a little random and even a little epic thanks to the BIG if inferior-to-Schwarzenegger presence of Jean-Claude Van Damme. Also very good is the decidedly one-note Raul Julia who did this as his last movie as one for his kids.So, what to criticize then if I'm trying to be fair? How about the completely non-sensical and basically militaristic plot, the weird blue camouflage gear made up as if the soldiers are fighting in the sea, the ill-attempts at comedy and the overwhelming bits of unintentional comedy, or just the cheesy make-up done for that guy in green with the orange hair? There's no limit to what to criticize, but at the same time Street Fighter is non-threatening in that way that sometimes bad movies can be. It arrives with a thud, and does some damage, but you can't say that you didn't have a little fun... unless, of course, you're looking for a really good video game movie, which is almost redundant at this point of modern cinematic history.",Street Fighter
7,BandSAboutMovies,Raul Julia makes this movie!,5,30 January 2018,"Street Fighter features many of the characters from the game and some of them hit the mark. Many of them don't. And for years, I wrote the film off. I wondered, why did they pick Raul Julia to play M. Bison? After finally watching it, I now know that no one else could have played him.How much do you really love the game? Then you'll probably hate how idiotic Ken and Ryu are. You'll probably dislike that E. Honda isn't Japanese. And you'll have trouble with the fact that Dhalism is a scientist and that Charlie and Blanka have been turned into the same character.But if you can get away from that, you pretty much get a live action cartoon. There's a great scene where E. Honda and Zangief (Andrew Bryniarski, Leatherface in the 2003 remake of The Texas Chainsaw Massacre) have a fight while Godzilla sound effects play. Kylie Minogue is great as Cammy, even if her costumes are a little more modest than the video game. Wes Studi makes a fine Sagat. And the fights are really fun.Best of all, Julia really makes M. Bison sing. There's a great scene of him trying to seduce Chun Li in his chambers and he has a portrait done of him by John Wayne Gacy. And he brings a Shakespearean gravitas to a role that a lesser actor would not work hard on at all. The fact that he was suffering from stomach cancer (he died two months before the movie was released) is amazing when you see how much he put into his performance.Street Fighter was the first movie that Steven de Souza directed. Up to then, he'd been better known as a writer, working on films as diverse as 48 Hours, The Return of Captain Invincible, Commando, The Running Man, Bad Dreams, Die Hard, Die Hard 2 and Hudson Hawk. He was beholden to a really rough schedule while working on the film, as Capcom had a hard and fast date that he had to hit. That said - he succeeds in making a silly take on the franchise. There's even a Goofy falling sound effect made by one of the enemy soldiers!",Street Fighter
8,Hey_Sweden,"""I like my games LIVE and in colour!""",8,29 January 2018,"The late, great Raul Julia plays an insane dictator named M. Bison who rules the roost in ""Shadaloo"", a fictional South Asian country. Currently he's holding a bunch of hostages for a staggering 20 billion dollars, and is at work on a process of turning ordinary soldiers into inhuman fighting beasts. Fortunately, he is opposed by the dedicated heroes of the ""Allied Nations"", led by Colonel Guile (Jean-Claude Van Damme). Other characters caught up in the melee include hustlers Ken (Damian Chapa) & Ryu (Byron Mann), and a reporter named Chun-Li (eternally gorgeous Ming-Na Wen) who can't be taken at face value.Big budget adaptation of the popular Capcom video game throws in everything but the kitchen sink for the sake of an entertaining show. Don't even bother attempting to watch it if you want to be intellectually stimulated or want anything resembling ""high art"". It's purely for action fans who want to be dazzled by spectacle (although not necessarily fans of the game). It's got plenty to keep it lively: hilariously tacky sets, an over the top nature, tons of explosions, vibrant widescreen photography, and some colourful characters. Subtle it ain't, but it is amusing, even if lacking the real wit one would expect from debuting director Steven E. de Souza, whose credits as a screenwriter include ""48 Hrs."" and ""Commando"". As you can see, de Souza gives it some semblance of a story, instead of just having one fight after another, which is what you might expect of a video game adaptation.The international cast features some classy thespians like Julia, Simon Callow, and Roshan Seth, in addition to familiar faces like Australian songbird Kylie Minogue, Grand L. Bush of ""Die Hard"", Miguel A. Nunez Jr. of ""The Return of the Living Dead"", and Andrew Bryniarski (Leatherface in two of the more recent ""Texas Chain Saw"" pictures). Ordinarily it would be depressing to watch an esteemed actor like Julia in their cinematic swan song (especially since Julia clearly looks ill), but he definitely seemed determined to go out in a blaze of glory, and he makes M. Bison a wonderfully grandiose, scenery devouring bad guy. Van Damme is good, and charismatic, as usual, but he can't help but look bland in comparison. Ms. Wen is a delight.Is this a ""good"" movie? This viewer is not going to go out of his way to make a case for it being one, but it's damn entertaining. Sometimes that's all that matters.Eight out of 10.",Street Fighter
9,preppy-3,Silly but lots of fun,7,31 July 2000,"I can't believe all the negative comments I've been reading here about this movie.  Really, people, what were you expecting from a Van Damme movie? Citizen Kane?  Yes it's silly, Van Damme's acting is atrocious and Raul Julia looks very ill (and is miscast) in his last theatrical film.  Still, the movie is not overly violent (hence the PG-13 rating), the script and the actors never take things seriously for one moment, everybody (except for Julia and Van Damme) give out good performances and some of the jokes are actually pretty funny.  Also there's a STRONG gay subtext between the Asian and American ""friends"".  Maybe I'm seeing something that's not there, but the looks those two exchange at times...  It's loud, it's VERY fast-paced...it's a HUGE amount of fun!  It's not classic cinema...heck, it's not even good cinema, just fun!  Turn off your brain and enjoy!",Street Fighter
10,poolandrews,I don't know whether to laugh or cry.,5,17 September 2007,"Street Fighter is set in the South East Asian country of Shadaloo which is recovering from a bloody civil war, evil warlord General M. Bison (Raul Julia) kidnaps some aid workers & Allied Nations soldiers & demands $20 billion or he'll kill them. Colonel William F. Guile (Jean-Claude Van Damme) disobeys orders & decides to attack Bison's hideout & take him down, however he isn't the only one who wants to see Bison dead & various assorted character's & fighters join in to help including boxer's, sumo wrestler's, karate experts & kung-fu kicking news reporters!This American Japanese co-production (it was part financed by Capcom who made the Street Fighter games this was based on) was written & directed by Steven E. de Souza & I don't quite know what to think about it. The film is based on the very popular Street Fighter series of computer games up-to Super Street Fighter II: The New Challengers (1993) which I was a big fan of & without wishing to boast was pretty darned good at & I could complete the entire game without losing a single fight! The script tries to shoehorn every character in even if they don't have a particularly large role except that of Fei Long who is the only character from the computer game that was left out (the final boss Akuma doesn't really count!) which is odd because considering this is a martial arts film I would have thought he would have been the easiest to fit in being a straight Bruce Lee homage. As a straight action flick this is pretty bad, there's actually a distinct lack of action & not that much fighting either. As a film based on a computer game it's bound to upset some who think their favourite character doesn't get to do enough or fight enough & some of the character's seem surplus to requirements & are there purely to get name-checked. Having said that this is one of those so bad it's good type films, the best comparison to it I can make is the old 60's Batman TV series as they both have a certain embarrassing camp value which makes them watchable & it only lasts for just over 90 minutes. For those who don't know keep watching as the end credits roll as once they finish there's another few minutes as Bison's hand bursts through some broken monitors & rubble on the floor.Director Souza is more used to writing big budget action films rather than directing them & it show's, the action isn't anything special & as already mentioned there's not too much fighting. Some of the computer game character's look silly on screen, Balrog in his boxing short's & gloves looks stupid & where did he get them from? Sagat doesn't look like his computer game counterpart, Vega isn't right, Blanka looks awful, Dhalsim looks nothing like his computer game persona & here they turn him into a scientist for some reason nor does T. Hawk, Dee Jay doesn't get to fight anyone although Chun-Li, Guile (played by JCVD even thought the character is American), Cammy (played by an Australian even though the character is English) & especially Bison all look good. There's nothing that violent here or particularly exciting & there's a lack of the character's special moves from the games as well.With a supposed budget of about $35,000,000 Street Fighter actually made triple that at the worldwide box-office even if it didn't deserve to. It's reasonably well made on location in Australia, Thailand & Canada & some of the sets are impressive but you can't help but cringe at the camp bits. The acting isn't that great, Raul Julia in his last film before he died is in top form, JCVD puts another nail in the coffin of his theatrical career while both Ming-Na as Chun-Li & Australian pop star & actress Kylie Minogue as Cammy are pretty hot looking.Street Fighter is one of those films I have a hard time deciding whether I liked it or not, I mean on the one hand it has a terrible story with stupid character's but on the other it's so camp & fun it's hard not to like it. I'll give it a straight down the middle 5 stars out of 10, I liked & hated it in equal measure.",Street Fighter
11,utgard14,"""This is merely superconductor electromagnetism. Surely you've heard of it?""",4,18 May 2014,"This movie suffers from the same problem as most video game or comic book adaptations in the '90s. The people making it just don't take the source material seriously so the whole thing comes across as one big garish cartoon with no attempt at characterizations or an intelligent plot. It's supposedly for teenagers and adults but it's intellectually on a level only pre-teen children can enjoy. There is some entertainment here, but only in that disreputable ""so bad it's good"" guilty pleasure way. Most of the actors ham it up, particularly a slumming Raul Julia in his last film. Jean-Claude Van Damme is about what you expect, only with ridiculous dyed blonde hair. I did enjoy Ming-Na Wen as Chun-Li but the rest are lame. This is also the disappointing film directorial debut of Steven E. de Souza, who had written the screenplays of some of the '80s best actioners. He also wrote this mess but unfortunately it's missing much of the wit that Die Hard, Commando, or Running Man had.",Street Fighter
12,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,Eh... wake me up when it's over...,1,28 July 2004,"When Jean-Claude Van Damme is starring in a film, you're already preparing for something bad, but this might actually be the worst film he's made, as it's more than just bad; it's excruciatingly bad. It's not the worst film ever made, but it's close. For an action/martial arts movie, the fighting/action sequences are very tame and far between. The plot is laughable at best, and full of holes. The acting is painfully bad. The characters are badly written stereotypes, not to mention that the film obviously tries incredibly hard to implement all of the characters from the video-games in the movie, which results in far too many characters, and far too many supposedly interesting characters are pushed into the background and settle for cameos, to make way for the more popular characters. The dialog is awful. The script is horribly badly written. The ""humor"" is childish and lame. The film has so many unintentionally funny scenes that it must be a record of some kind. The fight sequences are predictable and, like I mentioned earlier, tame. There are also far too few of them, considering that it's supposed to be the driving point of the film, rather than the predictable and badly written plot. The film really doesn't have anything to offer, honestly. I recommend it only to huge fans of Van Damme, and kids/teens with nothing better to do than watch some badly choreographed fights by Van Damme and various badly trained actors. Everyone else, find a better way to kill 90 minutes and skip this one. 1/10",Street Fighter

Van Dame sucks too, but that is no surprise...what really makes this movie bad though is the almost complete lack of fighting.  And why is Raul Julia Bison...Raul hasn't exactly made a career playing super tough fighters has he.  Seeing him fight Van Dame in the end is laughable.

It's not bad, it's just kinda boring. After awhile, I just got tired of seeing these underdeveloped characters all shoehorned into the story to fill a quota. Oddly enough, I got a real GI Joe vibe from this movie, far more than anything Street Fighter. One needs to watch something like this with beer in hand to fully appreciate the b-movie fromage. Alas, my fridge was tragically devoid of oat sodas, so I missed out (a mistake never to be made again, honest).I feel like I'm rambling. The point here, I guess, is that it's not the sacrilege that the internet has made it out to be . . . obviously, it's not great either, but hopefully if you approach this in the proper frame of mind, you might have a good time.Don't watch it alone.

17,JamesHitchcock,Don't Expect a Cinematic Masterpiece,3,7 March 2013,"In the fictional South East Asian nation of Shadaloo, an international peacekeeping organisation, the Allied Nations, has sent a military force to confront the armed forces of a drug lord turned military dictator named General Bison. As the AN's personnel all wear pale blue headgear it is not difficult to work out which real-life international peacekeeping organisation they are based on. As the United Nations are not always popular in America, particularly in right-wing circles, someone in Hollywood evidently thought that they could do with some good publicity. . The AN commander, and the film's hero, Colonel William F. Guile, is supposed to be an American, even though he speaks with a foreign accent and is played by Jean-Claude Van Damme. Given that the AN is a multinational organisation there is no reason why a Belgian could not be in command, but the film was evidently made on the basis of the American assumption that they will always be in charge of any international peacekeeping efforts. Guile's female second-in command, Cammy, is supposed to be British, even though played by the Australian Kylie Minogue, presumably reflecting the view that the Special Relationship means that Britain will always play second fiddle in supporting America's efforts. (At least Minogue does attempt a reasonably credible English accent). When Bison kidnaps several dozen humanitarian workers, and the AN's High Command want to appease him by paying the twenty billion dollar ransom he is demanding, Guile leads a mutiny and mounts his own operation to free the hostages. Several other characters play important roles in the subsequent developments, including Chun-Li Zang, a beautiful Chinese journalist with her own reasons for seeking revenge against Bison, Bison's ally the arms dealer Sagat, and Ryu and Ken, two con-men who get caught up in the action after trying to sell Bison fake weapons. The film resembles a sort of cross between a James Bond and a martial arts movie, although it never reaches the standards of any of the Bonds, even the weaker ones like ""On Her Majesty's Secret Service"" or ""Quantum of Solace"". (It doesn't measure up to the standards of many martial arts films either). The Bond influence is most apparent in Raúl Juliá's characterisation of Bison as an evil megalomaniac with dreams of world domination, and in the final assault by the AN forces on Bison's headquarters. Bison comes across as a cross between a Goldfinger-style Bond villain, Hitler (his uniform with its death's-head insignia is reminiscent of an SS officer) and Pol Pot (the Shadaloo flag is that of the Khmer Rouge with a green rather than a red background). This was Juliá's final feature film- he died soon after completing it- and he is about the only actor to emerge with any credit. Van Damme, however, is as wooden as he normally is, and even his fight scenes, normally something he does well, are not very convincing. Kylie originally came to public attention as an actress (in the TV series ""Neighbours""), but her performance here shows just why she has been well advised to concentrate subsequently on singing rather than acting. About the supporting cast, the less said the better. ""Street Fighter"" is based on a video game, and it is a general rule that whenever the words ""based on a video game"" appear at the beginning of a movie, they can also be translated as ""Don't expect a cinematic masterpiece"". There are a few partial exceptions to this rule- ""Prince of Persia"", for example, was not exactly a masterpiece but still managed to be a pretty decent action-adventure film- but this is not one of them. The acting, Julia apart, is wooden, the plot clichéd, the action sequences unconvincing and the attempts at humour leaden. The Bond films, at their best, can take implausible story lines like this one and turn them into stylish, sophisticated entertainment. Director Steven E. de Souza has been unable to turn ""Street Fighter"" into anything other than a prize turkey, devoid of style, sophistication or entertainment value. 3/10",Street Fighter
18,FeastMode,my notes,1,24 July 2019,"A joke. one of the worst movies ever made. another movie that makes me feel blessed to get to experience what good movies really are. watching it as a joke, this was entertaining and hilarious. filled with almost constant things you can make fun of. the acting is absurd. the actors were all horrible choices. some of my favorite characters from the game were played by someone so LAME. vega?!?!?! smh. i think every single casting decision was horrendous. van dam was a US soldier who can't speak english lmao. but the tattoo of the american flag proves that he's american. the fighting was disgustingly awful. so funny (2 viewings)",Street Fighter
19,bowmanblue,Just don't take it too seriously,7,12 April 2015,"Streetfighter 2 - the arcade so popular, it reinvented one-on-one beat-'em-ups. It was only natural that Hollywood was going to try and cash in on it. However, as Mario Bros found out, making a movie out of a (pretty plot less) video game is no easy task.First of all, let me say that Streetfighter the Movie is rubbish. Secondly, let me say that I loved it.There was no story to the arcade, so the film's writers were always going to have to take a hell of a load of creative licenses to try and gel it all together in some form of narrative format (after all, how much story can you get into sixteen people from around the world knocking the hell out of each other?). And, I think they did a pretty good job - at least with the story anyway. It follows - mainly - the film's biggest star Jean Claude Van Damme, As Colonel Guile, who leads an A.N. (that's 'Allied Nations' - think United Nations, but with a different name) task force of soldiers against the warlord dictator of (made-up country) Shadaloo, namely M. Bison. The 'Mussels From Brussels' is joined (and hindered) by almost all the other main Streetfighters (not that any fighting is ever done in any street, but never mind...).Unfortunately, what the film does well in coming up with a coherent and (nearly) believable story, it lacks in what fans want to see. Sadly, none of the actors are particularly good. There are too many characters and none of them are given enough screen time to particularly develop their characters. Plus many of them don't really look much like their on-screen counterparts. Not only that, but their computer-generated incarnations are also better at delivering their lines. The actors' dialogue is pretty clunky and cringeworthy. However, all this could be forgiven if the fight scenes were better. Okay, so it was released a few years before The Matrix redefined martial arts battles, but the fights are more similar to old James Bond fights where people just roll around on the floor a bit. The 'special moves' taken from the arcade are pretty hard to spot and, despite having a pretty big budget (for 1994), it makes you wonder where it was spent.So Streetfighter is a pretty bad film. And I still love it. Maybe because as a teen I played the arcade, or maybe because Kylie looks pretty hot as Cammy. It's camp, it's stupid, it's mainly for die hard fans of the arcade. If it ever finds a new audience, it will probably be with twelve-year-old boys as they would find it pretty much action-packed and exciting.The Matrix it is not. Stupid fun it just might get away with, even if Mortal Kombat is actually a better film.Don't be too harsh on it - at least Raul Julia gives one hell of a cape-swishing performance in his last ever on-screen role.",Street Fighter
20,ericstevenson,Very awful,2,1 June 2017,"Well, here we start with Video Game Month and it's very sad for me to watch this movie at all. At least I got to look back at some of the Nostalgia Critic's reviews. As an early video game movie, it's as awful as ever. The main problem is that it focuses on Guile instead of Ryu and/or Ken. Even worse, I would have at least given this film some credit if it had included the Hadouken or Sonic Boom, but we get absolutely none of that at all! Seriously, I was waiting for that at least at the end. The plot is stupid and really has little to do with the games at all. It's mostly just M. Bison trying to take over the world (of course!).The pacing in this film is terrible. I keep thinking there were deleted scenes that I missed. One scene we have Chun-Li talking about how she's going to get revenge on M. Bison and then later we just see them together. There's a good line or two, especially M. Bison's, ""For me it was Tuesday"". This was Raul Julia's last film and it's pretty easy to say that this was the worst last film of a noteworthy actor. It's a pity I knew little about him. It was dedicated to him which is pretty insulting. The sets in this film look terrible. The props are all bad looking.We just random talking scene after random fighting scene. There's no rhyme or reason for what's going on. I think this might have worked as a short film because it certainly feels like one stretched out to the length of a feature film. The scenes are redundant, especially with Bison just flying over and over. It mostly just suffers from being dreadfully boring. Even the stupid fight scenes have at least something going on. My pain has begun, my friends. *",Street Fighter

22,callanvass,"""Why do they still call me a warlord, and mad? All I want to do, is create the perfect genetic soldier!"" One of the most enjoyably cheesy experiences, you will ever have!.",6,27 January 2010,"Street Fighter is by no means, a good movie. In fact it's pretty bad, but part of me thinks a lot of them knew that going in, and they all managed to make the most of it. The lighthearted tone of the film really helps make it better, then it ought to be. I laughed a lot with some of Bison's cheesy, yet undeniably classic lines, and Van Damme showing off a comical side that is refreshing to see. A perfectly wooden, yet fun cast, provide many entertaining antics along the way. I enjoyed the chemistry between Damian Chapa and Byron Mann. They were natural together, and gave the movie a lot of laughs. The absurdity of the costumes worn in this movie, only made the movie that much more fun. Because you see, Street Fighter is all about the creativity, and cheerfulness. It was never meant to be a great movie, just a fun one, and I think they accomplished that well. The silly fight at the end between Guile and Bison, is the worth the price of the rental alone, it was a hoot!. This movie undeservedly gets too much flack for my liking, there are a lot of movies, much worse than this one.Performances. Jean-Claude Van Damme is certainly not good in the acting sense, but he is a lot of fun, nonetheless. His comical awareness is top-notch, and his silly bantering with the cast, gave me a lot of smiles. This is the reason I am such a fan of his, he is very charismatic. Raul Julia is great fun as Bison. It's a shame this was his last film, but he is the true Bison. Ming-Na is cute, and lively as Chun Li, I rather liked her. Damian Chapa and Byron Mann play off one another, wonderfully, I really loved watching them together. Kylie Minogue is pretty sexy, and most certainly wooden, but she had fun in her role, and that's all I wanted. Wes Studi is pretty good as Sagat, and did his job well. Grand L. Bush and Peter Navy Tuiasosopo are a lot of comic relief, and managed to be pretty entertaining. Miguel A. Núñez Jr. is silly and fun as Deejay. Rest of the cast are very lively, and do their jobs well.Bottom line. Street Fighter is a lot of fun, if nothing else. I'm aware it's a bad movie, but you know what? I don't care. All I care about is what entertains me, and Street Fighter does just that, every time I see it. Recommended for some cheesy fun.6/10",Street Fighter
23,The-Sarkologist,You will never get the time back that you spend watching this movie,1,9 December 2013,"There are some movies that are so brilliant that all of the holes in it make it even better. Street Fighter is not one of them. They have made movies from books, from toys, from old TV series, and from real life events, now they are making them from video games. Okay, they did that a while back with Pac Man, but that was a cartoon for kids. Street Fighter is not meant for kids - it is a Jean-Claude Van Damme action movie, which to me usually means that it is going to be rubbish. I watched Street Fighter expecting it to be rubbish and I was not disappointed.This movie I just could not take seriously. It was not a comedy and that was what made it worse. The only redeemable character was a tough so stupid that he didn't realise that the bad guy was actually a bad guy. It wasn't funny because it was funny, it was funny because it was just so stupid. This movie is one you watch with friends because you just sit there paying out all of the flaws.Some people say Van Damme can't act. Well, in this movie whenever he spoke I would wince. If he can't act then this movie proves it. And if he is supposed to be French then what is the accent that he has. The only reason Van Damme draws a crowd is because he is a good fighter, but you don't notice this in this movie, the fight scenes are rubbish. The bad guy flies around the screen shooting Van Damme with lightning bolts and Van Damme, with one kick, kills him. And this guy is supposed to be a top notch martial artist. Hey, he spends most of the movie fantasising over killing Van Damme and when he does meet him he gets his butt kicked in two seconds. All I can say is that I wish I missed this movie.",Street Fighter
24,Movie Nuttball,Good Van Damme film base on the video game classic!,10,7 August 2003,This movie based on the classic Street Fighter 2 video game is a good film and I don't think it deserves to be on the IMDb bottom 100: #48. Sure it may not exactly follow the game and some of the characters maybe inaccurate and the movie may seemed rushed at times but isn't other movies like that also especially if they are based on video games?Jean-Claude Van Damme is very good in the movie Guile but the late great Raul Julia put on the best performance in the film!He made M. Bison a really great and feared villain with such a spectacular personality!They other characters are good and most of them do resemble the ones in the video game.If you haven't seen Street Fighter and love Van Damme films and what to see Raul Julia in an excellent performance(arguably his best) then I recommend you see this action packed movie based on the great video game!,Street Fighter
25,tarbosh22000,One man's trash is another man's M.Bison!,4,29 June 2010,"We all love the Super Nintendo classic game ""Street Fighter"", but what was so annoying about it was that you had to press buttons and be interactive. And it didn't have Van Damme. Now you can sit back and relax and let the storyline take over! The plot involves General M. Bison (Julia) who wants to take over the world using genetic supersoldiers such as his guinea pig Carlos Blanka, but stopping him in his quest for world domination is Colonel William F. Guile (Van Damme) and his team of ""Street Fighters"" which include all the classic characters you know and love from the game, such as Ken, Ryu, E. Honda, Balrog, Cammy and Chun Li. Some of the evil characters are Zangief, Sagat, Vega and Dee Jay. They obviously took some liberties with the good and bad characters from the game. Naturally, Dhalsim is a scientist (with no stretching power).The 90's gave us some classic video game movies besides this one, such as Super Mario Bros.(1993), Mortal Kombat (1995), and Double Dragon (1994). What a golden time for unabashed cash-ins.When Van Damme isn't wearing his blue beret, we see that his hair is red. Not only is this the only movie to date where he is a ginger, As we all remember, Guile in the game is blond. A Van Damme highlight is when he says ""Bison...how many children are you going to orphan...I'm coming to get ya Bison!"" and then flexes his muscles in strange meathead fashion.Raul Julia as Bison once again proves the old adage ""Never have a last movie"". See Raw Nerve (1991) for more information on this. After a speech about ""stoicism"" he then proceeds to chew the scenery to pieces. But what would you do in his situation? You have to feel somewhat bad for Julia, but he seems to be making the best of the situation before his tragic death. There is a point in the movie where we see an artists' rendering of Bison as a sad clown. Huh???!!?? Bison's suit has rocket boots and a CPR function. In other words it inflates in and out very funnily. His big line in the movie is ""GAAAAAMMMMEEE OVVVEERRRR!!!!"" You gotta love it...I think.""Street Fighter"" is tailor-made for dumb-dums. Everything is spelled out for you. When gas floods Bison's HQ, Honda proclaims ""It's gas!!!"" When Chun Li jumps out of a window, Honda yells out ""She's gone!!!!"" Either Honda is a big moron, or he thinks the audience is.The budget must not have allowed for Dhalsim stretching, ha-do-kens and sonic booms. All the characters at least attempt to say their catch phrases. However, one of the most disappointing things about the movie is that E. Honda failed to do his classic move, the ""thousand-hand slap"". Why even make a Street Fighter movie if that's not in it? The movie almost justifies its existence when at the end, all the heroes jump up in the air and shout ""Yeah!"" and there is a freeze-frame. Then the title comes up (sans the subtitle ""The Ultimate Battle"", inexplicably seen during the opening titles). This is a great fan-favorite technique.After Mortal Kombat, Street Fighter is the second best video game movie of the 90's! For more insanity, please visit: comeuppancereviews.com",Street Fighter

Still, I bought the idea and went to the theater with high expectations.To be honest, the movie is not a disaster but it just didn't catch the vibe of the video game; it just didn't feel like ""Street Fighter"". The kung-fuesque action sequences were very interesting but didn't follow the greatness of the game. Mortal Kombat worked because it's characters were ""real"" persons while it was extremely complicated to get on the big screen real persons that were originally cartoons. Also, the plot was very complex when the video game makes it very simple. Still I enjoyed the cheese factor of it. The producers and Director tried too hard to make it feel like the video game but they couldn't reach the objective. Sadly, this movie is remembered as one of the worst of it's kind.

He did that awesome Flipping Flash Kick! Raul Julia(1940-94) as M. Bison was not bad at all. Too bad this was his final big screen. It was nice for the movie to say good-bye. Chun-Li play by Ming-Na really displayed her character well. And her pigtails were cute as well. Singer Kylie Minogue as Cammy? Not bad! I liked her Thrust Kicks and Hooligan Ride. Gregg RainWater as T-Hawk, great choice. The changes in other characters was a shocker: Edmond Honda, Hawaiian? Get Real! He's still sumo. At least he did the famous Hundred Hand Slap. Suzuki Balrog? His first name is Suzuki? And a good guy? Now that's something you don't see. I liked the part when he helped Cammy with the controls. BALROG: ""Allow Me."" , and punches the controls really hard. Deejay was bad, Blanka was an Incredible Hulk reject, Zangief is a moron, you figure out the rest.

32,freemantle_uk,So bad it's almost good,1,19 October 2008,"Street Fighter was one of the first computer games to be made into movie and help start the trend that computer games don't make good films. Street Fighter is at best an expensive B-Movie and few people deny that it's a bad film. However at the same time they is something strangely compelling when watching film.The story of the film is an international peace-keeping force is sent to a fictional country in South-East Asia. This force is led by Colonel William Guile (Jean-Claude Van Damme (a bad Beligan actor playing an American)). His mission is to help stabilise the nation after the overthrow of the director M. Bison. Bison has an evil plan to regain power of the country and then world dominion. He kidnaps civilians and he demands $20 Million and all the Allied Nations forces to leave the country in 2 days or he would start killing them. Instead of giving in, Guile leads his forces to fight back against the villain, like the American hero that he is. Ryo and Ken are involved as well, but they are con-men in this film, who are involved in the underground fighting scene before getting involved with Bison. Blanka is also in this film as a part of Bison's evil plan, where he hopes to make to super-soldiers that would help him on his quest.There are a lot of problems with this film: it is poorly written and directed. They is so much going on that it easy to get lost and lose interest: sometimes less is more when it comes to film-making. The acting is terrible, the action is sub-par, only Van Damme is any good at fighting. It also has too many characters from the game, which ends ups people not caring for some of them. It would have been easier to just have a few of the major characters from the game and focus on them. As well the film is disloyal to some of the game's characters, especially Ryu and Ken, who were not lovable rogues but good guys in the game. Balrog was also made into a good guy, when in the game he was bad game. The filmmakers also seem to be on a mission to have as many nationalists as possible and be a politically correct as possible. It adds to a scene of unintentional humour. The film is funny but for the wrong reasons. It is like a car crash, you know you shouldn't watch it but you can't help it.",Street Fighter

There's a nice sense of pure playfulness to this movie & it's performances all feel the same especially the hilarious but genuinely great performance from Raul Julia (R. I. P) as evil leader Bison, which was Julia's last movie performance as he was actually seriously ill & dying of Cancer while he was making Street Fighter so big respect & big love for that & gracing us with one of the best & most fun Villains in Cinema history!!! I love Bison even though he's the big evil mastermind bad guy, he's just such a fun presence & feels like a fully invested character & performance thanks again to the great Raul Julia (The Adams Family 1&2, The Rookie) & truly good actor who seemed to have so much fun playing crazy & wild characters like Bison & Gomez.Street Fighter also has the action legend Van Damme & he's fine as our main tough soldier hero Guile, he doesn't do much acting wise but is Cool for his action & Fighting scenes & I've always been a big Van Damme fan since his Apocalyptic Masterpiece Cyborg (1989). The rest of the ensemble cast are all ok to good in their roles many which are small to be honest but all fit in nicely to the story & all get a little bit to shine. Kyle Minogue is terrible though.I love the action set pieces & it's wacky fun & cheesy vibe as well as it's pure 90's Nostalgic feel & look.This is no masterpiece or Classic but it is exactly what it was meant to be & that's a fun action film based on a popular video game & that's what's truly good about this!!!Over time Street Fighter may become a proper ""Cult"" film? But i like it so much & always will anyway.All in all Street Fighter is simply a Nostalgic, Cheesy slice of 90's good natured & un-threatening action fun with a truly standout performance by Julia as Bison.I have fond memories of this flick & it makes a nice cosy late night piece of entertainment with plenty of Cool scenes & fun lines, mainly from Bison.",Street Fighter
34,hu675,This incredibly stupid movie does have some funny moments but suffers from miscasting and a bad script.,6,30 May 2008,"Colonel William F. Guile (Jean Claude Van Damme) and his troops are trying to stop an sadistic evil General M. Bison (Raul Julia) and his men. Since Bison has kidnapped tourists for $20 Billion Dollars in three days and he also has Guile's close friend (Robert Mammone) kidnapped as well. But there's trouble in the way, when an mysterious reporter (Ming-Na Wen) and two crew members (Grand L. Bush & Peter Navy Tuiasosopo) wants to kill Bison for personal reasons. While two con-artists Ken (Damian Chapa) and Ryu (Byron Mann) find themselves caught in the middle between the good and evil. Guile needs to find Bison before he murders the hostages and takes over the world.Written and Directed by Steven E. de Souza (Who wrote action films like ""Commando"", ""Die Hard"", ""The Running Man"") made an intentionally silly movie, based on a hugely popular Capcom video game. Julia is actually the main reason to watch this absurd feature, since it was one of his last films. Julia does has his moments in the movie and he gets some of the biggest laughs in it. Same goes for Andrew Bryniarski (Best known for playing Leatherface in the recent ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" remake and prequel) as Zangief, who's playing not as bright bad guy. But it's actually de Souza's script and some of his cast hurts the movie badly.Van Damme is certainly miscast as the lead and he's never believable as the American Colonel due of his Belgium accent of course. It's bizarre seeing Pop Star Kylie Minogue as Lieutenant Cammy, who gives the worst performance in the feature. Even Minogue admits that as well. The best acting from the film besides Julia is Roshan Seth as the sympathetic scientist/doctor and Wes Studi playing one of the main villains in the picture. Since ""Street Fighter"" was made for kids, the script could have used more imagination and better written as well.It is not a total waste, thanks to good production values and most of the cast tries hard to make it work. But in the following year ""Mortal Kombat"" was much more successful and better than this campy movie. ""Street Fighter"" over the years does have some loyal fans, even those who enjoyed watching bad taste in horrible movies. I find it watchable but it is not the kind of picture, i want to play it on my DVD player soon.From the ""Van Damme Quadruole Feature"", DVD features an clean non-anamorphic Widescreen (2.35:1) transfer and an good Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound. The Collector's Edition of ""Street Fighter"" wasn't anamorphic as well. From watching the film, it sure does looks like a mess. Which it explains they were five editors working on this picture. Producer Edward R. Pressman (Conan The Barbarian, The Crow, Wall Street) produces better features than this one.

Guile's character isn't as good, but Van Damme plays it decently, despite the fact that a million soldiers of Bison shoot him with rifles and he was able to divert from all of them. It's totally absurd and incredible, but I have to remember that Street Fighter is a film for children, not for old teenagers like me.

38,lemon_magic,This is the movie police. Put the DVD down and back away slowly.,3,24 December 2005,"I dunno, it's not so much that ""Street Fighter"" is that putrid. There are moments when things don't suck all that much. The real problem is that ""Street Fighter"" is so cheesy and ill considered that you can't believe that a) the movie produces would release it to the theaters and b) that anyone who wasn't a 14 year old male arcade dweller would ever pay money to see it. Consider some the inherent problems in making a ""quality"" adaptation of this game to the silver screen. First of all, you need at least a dozen male and female actors in good enough shape to at least LOOK like martial artists. You have to work up some decent fight choreography incorporating both wildly diverse martial arts style and the 'over the top' stunts that are only possible with wire works and CGI. You have to come up with a story that gives all these characters something to do, and you have to do it in a way that caters to the demands of the original fans of the fighting game. You have to have actors who can pretend to fight, or at least fighters who aren't total stiffs on camera. And (if background info on this movie is accurate) you have to try to do it on the cheap, sparing every expense. ""Street Fighter"" solves none of these problems, except for the ""cheap"" part. Instead, it goes for ""camp"" from the very start, and aspires to be a 1990s version of the original 1960s Batman movie (the one with Adam West, Caesar Romero and Eartha Kitt). It features Jean Claude Van Damme (a fighter who can't act) and Raul Julia (an actor who can't fight) mouthing some of the hammiest, corniest dialog in the history of cinema and forces them to do things neither of them were suited for. It features a plot that would have been rejected by the story editors of the old Republic serials. It utilizes virtually none of the the signature moves and styles of the supporting characters from the video game - the actors basically do ballet at each other while the camera cuts around to make us think that actual fighting is taking place. And the SFX and costumes are so cheap that you long for the purity of the hand drawn animation and character designs of the original games. I will say this for it, though - there are two or three moments in the film that are actually funny - most of these belong to the actor who plays the hulking Russian Sambo expert ""Zangief"" as a dim-bulb for comedy relief (BTW the movie never mentions that he practices Sambo). My favorite line in the movie belongs to him - ""You get PAID ?!?!"" That line and the way he delivers it add an extra star to the rating. Do NOT approach ""Street Fighter"" as anything other than purest Velveeta cheese food product, and you may be OK. Even then you may get annoyed enough to turn the DVD into a Frisbee and sail it out the nearest window.",Street Fighter
39,alexanderdavies-99382,The worst martial arts movie from JCVD!!,1,7 August 2018,"What in God's name was JCVD thinking when he signed up to make this load of piffle?? Everything about this film reeks of ineptitude and on a fairly grand scale. The acting, script, plot, direction (what there is of it) and special effects are woeful. Even the fight choreography isn't as good as it should be. The whole production bears no relation to the computer game whatsoever and is an insult to its legacy.
 The attempts at injecting some humour are about as cringeworthy as it gets and only causes acute irritation.
 With Van Damme, his expression usually reads something like: ""OK I'm here to save the world, nothing to worry about."" Superman he isn't! Too many characters have nothing to do and they are supposed to be involved in the action.
 Why a classically trained actor like Simon Callow would agree to appear in this, heaven only knows (reminds me of Laurence Olivier being cast in ""The Jazz Singer"" and ""Wild Geese 2"").
 In a way, I was glad that ""Street Fighter"" is the first Van Damme film I ever saw - simply because I knew there had to be better ones out there......",Street Fighter

Movies like this were made in such a way that they didn't appeal to the fans of the games or the casual movie audience.My primary complaint is the laughable casting. It's like the makers of the movie knew absolutely nothing about the games except for the sex, names, and races of the various characters. They make a huge effort to work the names of every character into the movie, just so the audience will (presumably) think it's cool to see their favorites on the big screen. But, Van Damme as an American soldier? Kylie Minogue as Cammy? Oh, and let's briefly mention the story. Balrog is a cameraman and Ryu and Ken (with brown hair!!) are some type of lovable con-men?

Was to Hitchcock. Unfortunately the comedy was too subtle.

It's true that Jean-Claude isn't very good; in fact, this movie, despite being a vehicle for him, would have been just as good (or bad) without him. But you have to admit that Raul Julia is a class act! In short, this movie was a lot better than I feared (though I'll grant that my expectations weren't high).Ming-Na Wen is very cool, and even Kylie Minogue is into the overall slightly self-ironical feel of the film.

45,mentalcritic,"I'd call this film crap, but that would insult fecal matter...",2,30 September 2004,"In the mid-1990s, video games were more popular than they have been before or since. It was therefore only a matter of time before films based on actual video games, as opposed to based on the concept like Tron, began to appear. To say that this new sub-genre had a less than impressive debut is like saying that Star Wars: A New Hope was a mildly unexpected success. When one views this example of the genre, however, one can see all sorts of reasons why.First of all, was it really necessary to include every character in the video game? Ken was often regarded as being unnecessary for the video game on which this dreck is based, and very few characters have any distinguishing characteristics. Guile could have had a chance to develop and show a personality, but they chose the worst possible actor on this planet to play him.To cap that off, the filmmakers make it clear in a hurry that they not only had no respect for the actual story of the video games, but for the slightest cultural details relating to it. Ken, in spite of being listed as hailing from the USA in the second video game, is actually Japanese. The bio given in said video game explicitly states that he is only in America to train against a wider variety of opponents. Someone also should have explained to the writers that Ryu is pronounced ""Ree-you"", not ""Rye-you"". That I know this in spite of not speaking a word of Japanese should tell you something about how much effort was put into this turkey.Raul Julia gets a thankless turn here as Bison, the evil dictator that took the story of the second video game out of the realm of mildly implausible and into the downright absurd. No explanation is given of who Bison is, what motivates him, or how he came to be the dictator of a satellite island of Thailand. This is acceptable in a video game, where stories are basically an excuse for action sequences. In film, however, where one is paying to basically see a story presented in a visual form, it is completely unacceptable.Making it worse is the fact that the action in the film is so bland and weak. If you're old enough to go and see a film like Hard Target or Face/Off, you have absolutely no reason to bother with this turgid effort. Not surprisingly, this was the beginning of the end for Jean-Claude's career, and it has more or less permanently crippled many others.All in all, I gave Street Figher a one out of ten. It was another eight years before they managed to make a decent film out of a video game. While this is no Wing Commander, it does come awfully close at times.",Street Fighter

51,Maziun,Laughable kitsch,1,23 February 2014,"Written and directed by Steven E. de Souza (writer of ""Die hard"" , ""The Running man"" and ""Commando"") this movie is often criticized as one of the worst movies ever. It's was based on popular computer game with no plot. Was there any plot in the game ? It doesn't really matters. The whole game was about colorful characters fighting with each other – that's it. Not really a material for good and serious movie. ""Street fighter"" is quite obviously aimed at kids. The whole story (bad guy wants to rule the world) , the dialogues , the humor , the costumes , music and art-direction are proof of that. The movie makers assumed that little kids are the fans of the video game , so they made movie aimed at them. That's why the movie is so bad.Fans of the game weren't happy with the movie , since it took some liberties with the characters and story. It works however as a decent adaptation. It presents quite many characters from the game that are quite well written into the story. Most of the characters did look like themselves or at least tried to.The movie has it's share of memorable and funny one-liners and dialogue. For example : ""Quick , change the channel"" , ""I guess you didn't see that"" or Bison's speech about burning the village.The best thing about this movie might is probably Raul Julia (""The Addams family"") performance as the evil general Bison. Julia understands perfectly the whole B-class movie style and is simply adorable in his performance.Jean Claude Van Damme , Kylie Minogue and the others are terrible when it comes to acting.There are some little jokes hidden in the movie - parody of Japanese monster movies from the 1950s , lovely scene with the drawing , a parody showing Bison as Hitler. You can even hear the voice of who was the main hero of movie ""Good morning Vietnam"" If nothing else this a ""so bad , it's good "" type of movie. You will get quite a lot of cheap laughs of it. It's definitely more entertaining that many of those serious and professional movies. It never takes itself too seriously and it's so silly that it's almost an art. Today movies are trying hard not to be cheesy. This one embraces the cheese. The just don't make them like this anymore and that's at least one good reason to watch this movie.I give it 1/10.

It stars the goofy Jean-Claude Van Damme, a low rent combination of Arnold Schwarzenegger and Bruce Lee, who's idea of acting is based on grunts and a heavy dose of stink eye. There is also pop star Kylie Minogue and...Raul Julia. What the hell is he doing in this? At least he is having fun, but this is not the type if film that should be remembered as his last. Watching somebody play Street Fighter is more enjoyable than this. The characters are morphed into these freaks of what they are in the game, several of them bear no real resemblance. Vega, Blanka, Dee Jay, and Dhalsim are the ones that come to mind. The fights are lazily choreographed, with little attention paid to what characters were capable of in the game and the movie even falls to give any background or real motivation.

Sure, there hardly is character development in any of the genre films, but that wasn't my beef. It's the fact, that effects are poorly made, settings are bad and even the actors are more bad than usual.Actually Street Fighter looks like very typical late 80's small budget action film. Only problem is, that it was made mid 90's and it had a budget over 30 millions. With that money more capable director would have made very enjoyable action flick, but of that there are no worries in the Street Fighter.Jean-Claude Van Damme gives out a even bit more worse display of his actinic skills than usual.

In fact, I'm actually ""shocked"" and ""surprised"" just how low it really is. I think it's worth at least a seven. Street Fighter is a good movie in my view. It's thoroughly entertaining. It's full of action and fights. It has all your favourite characters just like in the video games. The movie, Street Fighter, is not to be taken seriously. It's based on the video game series. I'm glad a movie was made though. I always wanted a ""Street Fighter"" movie, and that's what happened. People should be happy there's a Street Fighter movie. It came out during the nineties. I'm a Street Fighter fan, but another reason I was interested in the movie was because it involved one of my favourite action-heroes Jean-Claude Van Damme. He played the character - Colonel William Guile. He's one of the most popular characters in the Street Fighter franchise or series. I also like his theme song, but it was not part of this movie. Jean-Claude Van Damme was the right choice to play that character. He was so cool; he was so good. Street Fighter would've miserably failed without him. It was down to him why the movie was exciting. Another thing I liked about the movie was that it was staring Kylie Minogue. She was the other reason why Street Fighter was exciting to watch. She was so hot! A lot of people who seen the movie has forgotten about her. Jean-Claude Van Damme and Kylie Minogue made a great team, and I'm talking about the characters they were playing. The character Kylie Minogue played was like some sort of assistant to Colonel Guile. Let's not forget the other two popular characters in Street Fighter: Ken and Ryu. In the movie, Street Fighter, it seemed that Guile had the bigger role compared to Ken and Ryu. I don't have a problem with that, but it would've been nice to see Ken and Ryu more in action. They were quiet in the movie. And let's also not forget about General Bison. He's the exact opposite to what Guile is. Street Fighter is a movie that looks better when it's on television during the evening. That's my impression! I don't think the overall rating will change for the better anytime soon, but I still think Street Fighter is a fun movie. It's an action movie. I'm glad there was no sequel though. It makes Street Fighter hold more weight. You should give Street Fighter a chance. I also like the poster or front cover which depicts Colonel Guile or Van Damme.

61,jayjaycee,A film like that crashed car you can beat up in this bonus level,3,7 November 2020,"""Street Fighter"" is an action film directed by Steven E. de Souza starring Jean-Claude Van Damme and Raul Julia.
⚪
All in all, Steven De Souza's attempt to bring one of the greatest beat'em ups to life fails miserably, because this film knocks itself out cold from the very beginning, as the whole production is almost two hours of pure cheesiness, and despite the appearance of almost every beloved character, the extraordinarily corny acting, the abysmal plot and the ludicrous story make this adaptation a cringe worthy and utterly questionable production that marks the career low of everyone involved.
⚪
After the previous film has been a masterful drama that received a perfect score, I thought the only way to hold the balance would be if I watched a terrible film. Hence I decided to check out probably one of the worst video game adaptations that ever seen the light of day, and even if I hoped it would be slightly better than its reputation, I had to accept the truth that it lives up to its status. How can anyone who is not totally deluded green-light this whole production? Seriously, imagine one of the worst scripts you can come up with and lubricate it with faeces, cause apparently, this is the exact procedure that has taken place when the officials discussed the making of this disaster. I mean, what is the purpose of this film, anyway? Apparently, its story is based on the lore of the ""Street Fighter II"" game, but why in the hell would they do this? This game's sole purpose was to give kids and adults alike the chance to virtually beat up their best friends at arcades on Friday evenings, nobody cares about the story, it is completely irrelevant for the enjoyment of the game. However, producers seemingly thought it was a phenomenal idea to use this as a base for a full length feature film (that inexplicably runs for almost two hours) that wants to cause the exact excitement that fans experience when playing the game. What else can I say but that they failed terribly? The ""Street Fighter"" games and spin-offs are my favourite beat 'em up franchise, and me and my brother have fought us for many years now, and as a fan, I can say that it is one of the greatest for a reason. Accordingly, tremendous was my disappointment when I sat through this abomination that dares to call itself ""Street Fighter"". First, why did they degrade the game's actual main characters Ryu and Ken to useless and ridiculously incapable side characters and made Commander Guile, who is a useless and ridiculously incapable side character in the game, the protagonist of the film? Just kidding, we all know the answer to that, they did it simply because he is American and only Americans can save the world from evil warmongers, especially in a country that resembles Vietnam a lot. Considering that is an American production, this is dumb but understandable, but why did they cast The Muscles From Brussels as the true American icon? All my admiration for him put aside, he can barely talk in English, how did they expect him to master an American accent? Furthermore, who thought that he was the ideal choice? He looks like a cosplayer who comes last place and gets barred from any contest in the world, and I am not even talking about his costume. What happened to his hair? Why didn't they cast Dolph Lundgren? I know that he isn't from the states either, but at least he resembles the character optically, doesn't he? Instead they casted the constantly cocaine sniffing and philandering martial arts star, because he was popular at that time, but hey, he is not the only one responsible for this fiasco. Even if I was surprised to see that they in fact included most of the beloved character from the video games, I was just embarrassed by how they casted the roles and how they looked? Some were nailed pretty decently (Andrew Bryniarski as Zangief was on point!), but they all acted so painfully ridiculous. What do you expect, though, when you cast pop singer Kylie Minogue as Cammy? Well, if there is one whose performance nears the term ""acceptable"", it is the late Raul Julia as antagonist M. Bison. Seriously, despite the terribly written script, he delivered decently as the warmonger who combines the most famous character traits of every dictator who has ever walked the earth. But even Gomez Addams cannot save this mess of a film. The story is utterly ludicrous and doesn't even make an effort to be acceptable, as long as every character appears more than once, it thinks it has done enough. Also, this film is an adaptation of a fighting game that consists of over the top moves and exaggerated choreographies, so where are the combat scenes and signature moves? Seriously, there is little to no brawling and when I thought I have recognised a shoryuken or a hadouken, I laughed so hard, simply because it was so terrible. And why do they have so much trouble finding the hostages? They all have seen that they are in this pit in the middle of the stage. Just when I thought it couldn't get any worse, they all did their winning pose from the games, and I cringed so hard. Seriously, this film does everything in its power to be cheesy and unbearable for fans of the game. In the end, I even cried, simply because it is so dreadful. This film is probably one of the worst video game adaptations that exist...",Street Fighter
62,jonathanruano,Street Fighter,4,9 November 2012,"Jean-Claude Van Damme is back in action as a Colonel no less who, in the time honoured tradition of the fake Hulk Hogan-type wrestling matches, challenges Saddam Hussein look-alike, General Bison (Raul Julia), to a fight of all the ages. The filmmakers tried to make this film funny, which is an appropriate strategy given how preposterous the plot is. Unfortunately, the jokes usually don't quite come off the ground, though a couple worked: like when Raul Julia claimed that he was creating killing machines for the good of mankind. That joke made me think of those American policymakers who say that they want world peace, but neglect to tell their audience all the violent things they are prepared to do to achieve universal peace. Another one was Raul Julia's claim that he could actually make one of his Bison bucks convertible into just five English pounds just by holding the Queen hostage. You don't have to be an expert in monetary policy and fluctuating exchange rates to realize why this claim is so laughable. But aside from that, the jokes persistently fell flat. In addition to the bad jokes, the other problem with the film is wall-to-wall scenes with property being destroyed as a cheap ploy for generating entertainment.Finally the most unfortunate thing about this movie is how it wastes the prodigious talents of some really great actors. Wes Studi was unbelievably good as the Heron native Mogwa in ""Last of the Mohicans"" (with Daniel Day Lewis and Madeleine Stowe), but his acting gifts are wasted here as the villain Victor Sagat. At least, Studi had a sense of humour throughout this picture. Similarly Roshan Seth delivered wonderful performances in Attenborough's film Gandhi and David Lean's Passage of India. But in this movie, Seth is reduced to a nerdy scientist, though he is capable of so much more than this. How did Seth, given his remarkable acting career, end up in a movie like this? Finally Simon Callow gave a memorable performance in Milos Forman's Amadeus, but here he is reduced to a Neville Chamberlain-type appeaser.

They are totally opposite from the original, in kinda childish way You need to check the film out, to see what a hell I am talking about. I'll mention only this example, well, I mentioned it before Col. Guile (Van Damme) is a leading man, instead of Ryu (Byron Mann) and that's unacceptable! I give it up For the end, Raul Julia OK Julia was the best actor in the film. No more, no less. From his theatrical background he brought us a different kind of M. Bison. By the original, Bison is dark, calm and super evil. Here, he is cheerful, evil but extremely over the top. Thanks to Julia and his enormous acting talent and unmistakable charisma, his Bison is marvelous. Every word he says, every move he makes, we are watching him, he knows how to attract attention. Raul Julia stated that he starred in the film because of his sons, who loved the video games. So, just for his kids, well fathers are real heroes in real life. But, when the film was nearly over, he died from cancer and the movie was dedicated to him. That's noble but is it really noble to dedicate this piece of crap? I would spin in my grave. I would give a posthumous Oscar to Raul. He did a magnificent job. Just like Frank Langella did a good work with Skeletor in Masters of the Universe (1987). Great actors can't save the crappy films, but they can make them more interesting and fun to watch.Overall don't watch this film, you have something better to do. Stick to the games and anime. It's far more better and more faithful to the spirit of the original.",Street Fighter
66,ThomasColquith,An Enjoyable Romp,7,26 September 2021,"I think ""Street Fighter"" is a better movie than the abysmal 4/10 IMDB rating suggests. I rated it a 7/10 because I enjoyed it that much even though it is kind of corny and silly, but that is the point, it is just intended to be that kind of film and I think it succeeds at that. Look how Bison uses buttons and a joystick to set off river mines, obviously a nod to the gaming console; it celebrates all of this more than poking fun at it or succumbing to it. I thought that the filmmakers did a fine job of achieving what they set out to do. The sets were cool, cinematography good, acting adequate, the script was not real deep but what do you expect. I thought that Raul Julia and Ming-Na Wen were terrific in their parts.The only change I would have made was excise the Blanka storyline as I thought that it was too dark and cruel in the context of such a silly fun fatuous movie. So, all in all, I rate it a 7/10, though I am somewhat biased as I played the Street Fighter II video game before and was familiar with the characters.",Street Fighter

69,haterofcrap,Garbage,1,19 March 2013,"""Street Fighter"" is a typical video-game: Dumb, boring and poorly made, with zero appeal to most viewers, even those who, unlike me, can enjoy a dumb action flick as long it is entertaining. The sad thing that is ""Street Fighter"" is not only dumb, but also terribly boring as well. It has an idiotic plot, bad performances and many pathetic scenes that made one viewer wonder in what were the makers of this movie thinking. It also has Jean-Claude Van Damme (one of the worst actors from the entire cinema history) as the main star, and that is enough reason to stay far way from this terrible movie.The ""Street Fighter"" movie is just as bad as the ""Resident Evil"" movies.",Street Fighter

So then, I saw it. Video games based on movies are most of the time poor productions. Movies based on video games tend to be even worse. And this movie is even worse than that, if that's even possible. And I promise you, when you see this, you'll know that it is. For starters: Guile is American. Van Damme with his French accent is a totally wrong choice for the role. He also looks totally different than Guile. The story is Ridiculous. Even when you had expected a bad script since it's based on a video game, it still disappoints you. The fighting scenes suck, if you can call them fighting scenes at all. I just don't figure why van Damme didn't quality-check this crap out of his movie portfolio. The only good thing in this film is Zangief, and that is only because he was so stupid and funny.",Street Fighter
71,The_Phantom_Projectionist,"""Quick! Change the channel!""",6,10 May 2015,"The biggest distinction that STREET FIGHTER: THE MOVIE holds for me is that it's the first Van Damme picture I ever saw. On a global scale, it was the first video game-film adaptation to turn a buck, which should count for something despite the routine bashing it receives for how shoddily it portrayed the most popular fighting game of the time on the big screen. I was personally never a huge STREET FIGHTER fan, but while I can certainly spot the plot line unfaithfulness, I can't help but notice just how fun the movie is. It's a poor adaptation and a questionable action movie, but nevertheless a decent teenaged adventure when taken at face value.The story: When the mad warlord General M. Bison (Raul Julia) is poised to overrun the earth in pursuit of his own personal empire, it will be up to a multi-faceted group of fighters - including Colonel William Guile (Van Damme), reporter Chun-Li (Ming Na), and conmen Ryu Hoshi (Byron Mann) and Ken Masters (Damian Chapa) - to stop him.This film is definitely over-cast, comparable to MORTAL KOMBAT: ANNIHILATION in terms of saturation. No less than fifteen characters from the original two games - more than half of their combined casts - are featured, resulting in a stifling deficit of character development, since next to none of them have the appropriate amount of screen time for it. The actual casting choices of these characters can also be taken to task, but I'm pleased that - through the admirably accurate costumes and cosmetics - most of the performers at least *look* like their animated counterparts (in some cases, like Robert ""Blanka"" Mammone, you almost wish they didn't). Personalities and backgrounds have been addled with as expected to accommodate the tournament-free premise, but none of them bother me as much as the case of M. Bison: he's the single goofiest part of this whole immature adventure, practically a forerunner to Dr. Evil, having been written so comically that it's impossible to consider him threatening even when he's snapping guys' necks or shooting electricity from his fists.The movie never has a problem with pacing, rolling along fittingly enough at a video game's pace and always presenting you with some silly or bombastic event to watch; it's never boring. Sadly, there's not nearly enough fighting going on, and when it does happen it's not that great. It seems amazing that, considering what it's based on, the movie only has a 'round half-dozen fights, depending on your definition of a fight (i.e. I don't consider it a fight when Guile and his team ambush some soldiers and Kylie Minogue does a cool but unnecessary pro wrestling move), and even more amazing how very bland most of them are with Benny Urquidez supplying fight choreography. Some of the performers just aren't good, and some of them surprisingly so (is this the same Damian Chapa who rocked the house with Michael Worth in U.S. SEALS 2? I hope not!), but other times they just feel stifled. For example, the showdown between Ryu and Vega (Jay Tavare) was my favorite of the movie, and really felt like it could've gone somewhere were it not for the cramped locker room they were in.Apparently, the critical lashing STREET FIGHTER received moved Van Damme to choose his future roles more carefully, so in a pinch, I'll accredit every good movie he did subsequently to this minor disappointment. Seeing as this particular franchise hasn't done too well in live-action film regardless of who's involved, I can't be too hard on this first attempt and will continue to regard it neutrally and enjoy it by accident every few years. Fans of the games who somehow have yet to see the film should avoid it unless they're intentionally looking for something to heckle.",Street Fighter
72,BrickNash,Money making garbage which didn't care whether it was a good film or not.,2,5 May 2014,"Trash!This would be the best word to describe this train wreck of a film. As a boy I was a huge video game player and I adored the fighting genre. Double Dragon, Final Fight, Golden Axe and then came Street Fighter II and blew everybody's socks off so it was only a matter of time before a film version was made but I don't think anyone expected it to be this bad.Just to clear things up, I adore low budget 80's and 90's action/martial arts films. They have a quality that is so pathetic and funny yet is backed up with tremendous action and fight sequences and the reason they are like this is because they are trying to be serious. Street Fighter has none of this charm! The film was not made to be good, it was not made to stand the test of time or reach for any awards or even please fans, it was simply a quick cash making effort with the name of an immensely popular game.For a start the film looks dreadful! A scattered assortment of tents, boxes and scabby buildings make up the wobbly sets giving the whole film a cheap and grubby look that just doesn't work at all. Seriously, King Of The Kickboxers probably had a fraction of the budget of this film and looks 10 times better with genuine Thai locations and vastly superior fights. The costumes all look like they were made the night before by the cast's mothers and aside from all looking far too new, they don't fit very well and would be better suited to a high school pantomime.The script is laughable, chock full of crap one liners, crowbarred in to attempt to get the 8 year old's in the audience to laugh and probably failing miserably. Then comes the changes, the many changes! Street Fighter II should have been what the game was, an Enter The Dragon style tournament which, while not being original in any way, would have more than kept the feel of the game rather than the crappy dictator style story. Ryu is now an American, Guile is now Belgian, Sagat is Native American Honda is Hawaiian, Dhalsim a Doctor....OK the last one wasn't so bad and I sort of liked the crossing of Guile's friend Charlie with Blanka but it was handled in such a shallow, Batman & Robin sort of way that all credibility was taken out. Vega does look pretty accurate I will admit but doesn't actually do much.The fight scenes are few and child friendly (e.g. short, boring and fast cut!) I was shocked to learn that the action was choreographed by the great Benny ""The Jet"" Urquidez. A superb martial artist and star of many Hong Kong martial arts films and names including Jackie Chan, but I have s suspicion that the studio told him to calm it all down.It's really hard to like Street Fighter, even as a bit of fun because it's such a poorly tacked together piece of filmmaking that simply doesn't care about whether it is a quality product or not.The wonderful Raul Julia does what he can with the horrible script and actually looks like he is having fun with it. Kylie Minogue looks very hot in a uniform and she's always a joy to watch but that's honestly the best things I can say about the film.If you haven't seen it, then watch it and see for yourself and then watch the infinitely superior Mortal Kombat film which not only manages to be a reasonably faithful conversion of the game but is a great looking action film in it's own right with really some decent fight choreography and special effects (for the time!)If you really crave Street Fighter II specific action on screen then I highly recommend the superb Street Fighter II anime film which pulls no punches and is almost infinitely superior to this garbage in every way including fight scenes, story and accuracy.",Street Fighter

Wow. This kind of starts off having the feel of Flash Gordon to it, or something similar. The problem is that it takes itself too seriously. It could have worked if they had kept it silly or lighthearted, like on Crank: High Voltage. They just do nothing for the first half hour but lay out all the main characters, as if forcing it down your gullet with a hot poker. Around an hour-twenty into it, during the speed boat scene, I had to shut it down. It was just totally unwatchable. One of the worst parts is at the beginning when, on national television, which Bison is watching, Guile (Van Damme) outs one of his own soldiers, who was captured by Bison!! Instead of giving a personal perspective, like a Mortal Kombat style fighting, it kind of gives an epic, ""map of the world"" perspective, which did not work well.",Street Fighter

JCVD was not right for this movie. I would have gotten someone like Dolph Lundren or anyone else instead to be Guile.The film crew aspect for E. Honda, Chun Li and so forth was really dumb and then whoever they couldn't fit in to be ""bad guys"". The back story they gave Bison was so silly that he had to be a drug dealer and all this nonsense to get to where he was. I honestly liked the mysticism about a lot of them just knowing for example Bison is a powerful man should have been enough Raul can act but all the theatrical stuff he keeps spouting makes him look silly. The actors who played Ryu and Ken hardly look a thing like them and I feel the story should have revolved around them more than this watered down action story that they proposed I guess it was easier for Hollywood to do. They could have just had a tournament and instead .. we get .. this.The special effects look awful. Most of the locations looked boring. They even hinted a fight against Vega versus Ryu but the second they are about to fight instead of having a poorly choreographed fight they make you watch more of this extremely mediocre movie. Blanka is a joke in this movie how he looks. That electric zap effect near the end is awful.

He is played by Jean Claude Van-Damme and is a French dude witch inflated fake muscles. Which I can't tell if it's Guile or Van Damme who things they are real. It's really hard to tell.Chun-Li is a news reporter instead of an Interpol agent, and Balrog and E. Honda are her news team? What? You mean Balrog from the games that works for Shadaloo is now a reporter?? Sagat is not Sagat. The patch is on his wrong eye, and he's not as tall as he should be. Once again, why didn't the creators of this movie reconsider putting their powers on this film??Ryu and Ken are one of the saddest parts of this film. Instead of being trained by Gouken.

Also, stop thinking that Guile and Nash are Bison's archenemies, because they aren't. Everyone knows Ryu and Ken fight Bison.I can't believe Capcom approved of a movie like this.

79,wchngliu,"Streetfighter is Beyond Tragic, Rather It Sucks",1,3 July 2007,"There are clearly no other words to describe how terrible Streetfighter the movie is, other than the director, writers and producers of this film have paid little attention to the video game. I've played Streetfighter 2 a few times in the past and so I am well familiar with the characters in the game. By far, one of the most horrendous films ever produced, the truth is this could've been a great film to watch. Sadly however, the martial arts fighting style has been mostly watered down in favour of ammo, guns and bazookas. As for the cast, I beg to differ when in comes to criticising the cast choices; likewise, Cammy- she is supposed to be British and so she has an English accent and yet who plays her role? Kylie Minogue, of whom is in fact an Australian and is more famous for her pop career than a film one. If I was the director, I would've hired Tamzin Outwaite who used to be in the British soap opera east enders, as a) she's blonde and b) she's a Brit. As for Guile, Van Damme? Are you sure? He has a Belgian/french accent, for goodness sake. I would've had Dolph Lundgren instead, never mind Van damme. Okay, Lundgren is from Denmark but he sounds more American than Van Damme does. And instead of Ming-Na Wen for the role of Chun Li, I'd have Zhang Zhi in her place. I have nothing against Ming, as i think she is very talented and deserves better than this tripe but rather I'd have an actual Chinese born actress playing a Chinese Born character. Speaking of Chun- Li, whoever thought of the idea of her being a news reporter?! That is so ridiculous. As others have said on here, Guile was never the main character in the game- and yet to the directors, they thought that because Van Damme was more well known and recognisable than Kylie and the others in the acting, sorry film world, they thought we might has well have him as the main focus of the movie. The inconsistencies in this flick are there for fans to see. The fight scenes are almost laughable to watch. This version of Streetfighter, is OMG so bad that this movie and Super Mario Bros must rank up there as the worst of the worst in film video game adaptations.

He consistently fails to incorporate the necessary elements (worthwhile supporting cast, interesting plot and at least a decent script) that would make any of his films successful.  After so many downers, one would think he'd try to deviate from his standard, (selling the whole movie on himself and his martial arts skills..) but no... here he manages to scrape up only one positive component - a great villain.

89,SwingBatta,"Stupid ""Fighter"" should be left in the street",3,25 March 2002,"Cutting right to the chase, watching ""Street Fighter"" - based on what was the most popular video game in the world until ""Mortal Kombat"" came along - is not the equivalent of observing a train wreck; it's the equivalent of being in one. The thin story has Colonel Guile (Jean-Claude Van Damme, complete with a bad dye job and American flag tattoo) attempting to rescue relief workers held hostage by General M. Bison (portrayed by the late Raul Julia, always a professional to the end) in the fictitious Southeastern Asian country of Shadaloo. Guile is in charge of a military force, called the ""Allied Nations,"" that has been recruited to defeat Bison. I guess we're finally at peace, because apparently every world leader could afford to deploy hundreds of their soldiers to some destitute armpit of a country to fight someone wearing a red leather suit and cape.While the plot is simplicity itself, it's too bad that the other 99% of the film is an utter display of stupidity, such as having the ethnically diverse cast portray characters of totally different races. For example, Native American actor Wes Studi plays a character of Thai descent, while casting Belgian Van Damme as gung-ho patriot Guile makes as much sense as having Ronald McDonald play Norman Schwarzkopf. It's a wonder that writer/director Steven E. de Souza didn't make someone show up in blackface.
Never mind that ""Street Fighter"" is based on a game built around the martial arts, because there is virtually none of it to be seen anywhere. There is an incredible amount of gun violence, and of course the good guys are perfect shots while the baddies couldn't hit water if they fell out of a boat. Guile even holds off over a dozen of Bison's henchmen with a bottomless machine gun clip  as he sits out in the open, no less. Meanwhile, two soldiers, each armed only with a handgun, are able to confront an entire army equipped with AK-47s.The ending is pathetic. Try to keep a straight face when Guile gives a pep talk to a group of soldiers as they gear up for the big showdown, or when he says to Bison, ""This is the collection agencyyour ass is six months overdue, and it's mine."" Besides rampant intercutting between several inferior fight scenes, the lousy showdown between Guile and Bison consists of an incomprehensible and dizzying hodgepodge of fast edits in order to conceal Julia's stunt double. (During this contest, the 180-degree rule is broken quite often: in one scene, Guile is facing screen right as he attacks Bison. After a brief cut to Bison, Guile is suddenly facing screen left.)Plot holes are as abundant as the story's lack of coherence. For instance, the AN soldiers navigate ""inflatable assault crafts""  complete with outboard motors  through a river that leads to Bison's fortress. Not only is the word ""inflatable"" misspelled on every one of the boats, but how could those huge motors fit in the flat carrying pouches, and how were they able to inflate all the boats?On a closing note, here's an interesting bit of trivia: In 1999, de Souza had an equally lambasted script for another video-game-to-film adaptation rejected.

It was a game I used to play for hours with friends, beating each other up, and it didn't get old. You know why? Because it was a video game and not a movie! Who in their right mind thought that they could take a video game with a plot as thin as a starved Paris Hilton, and turn it into an enjoyable movie? Again, ""The plot is too thin, so let's rewrite all the characters and the entire storyline so it doesn't even remotely resemble the game"". Whoever pitched them this idea should be locked in a theater and made to watch this movie over and over and over again nonstop for a month!

92,Yonhap S,trying too hard...,4,13 September 1999,"Not so bad, but below average.  I've read a gaming magazine's interview on Steven deSouza and this film.  In it, he pointed out why Super Mario Bros. was a disappointment because the characters were being to be like the videogame too hard.  One such example was how the producers could make the Mario Brothers leap high like the game by giving them mechanical boots. Ironically, the Street Fighter movie suffers from the exact same reason.  We get lame reasons for some of the characters' costumes, and Ryu's fireball. Both movies also have trouble with their setting.  Why can't Super Mario Bros. be in some fantasy land with cartoony mushrooms?  Why can't Street Fighter be some sort of tournament or challenge?  Some kind of realism had to be applied where it just couldn't be done.I don't have much problem with the relation of the characters since Mortal Kombat successfully switched Scorpion and Subzero into Shang Tsung's minions.  It's not all bad since we see Kylie Minogue, Ming Na Wen, and basically awesome fight between Guile and M. Bison.The verdict: 2 of 5 stars.",Street Fighter

95,The Spectacular Spider-Man,Words cannot describe the sheer awfulness,1,7 October 2001,"This is possibly one of the most embarassing movies ever. Take a really, really poor script that for some reason rejects the most obvious approach - an Enter the Dragon/Bloodsport/Kickboxer martial arts tournament - and goes for a ridiculous special forces operation against evil dictator Bison. The large crew of comicbook-like characters could logically turn up for a martial arts tournament (that's what the game is about), but that they all happen to turn up in Thailand at the same time instead is absolutely ludicrous. Just as silly is the film's attempt to recreate the characters from the video game onscreen. John Claude Van Damme would have been an acceptable Guile had he been a supporting character that didn't say much, just kicked ass, but as the lead....he sucks. The guys supposed to be Ryu and Ken are hilariously wrong for the part, as is the wrestler-type guy supposed to be the male model like, acrobatic Vega. And why is Kylie Minogue Cammy? The only casting that is in anyway accurate to the game is Raul Julia as Bison, and he gives the only decent performance, an amusingly tongue-in-cheek explosion of evil. Thankfully the urban myth that this was his last film isn't true. Then there are the terrible attempts to recreate the moves from the game. Watch 'Ken' do what's supposed to be a Dragon Punch on 'Sagat' and laugh - that's what we kids used to do in the school yard in 1991! The other moves are just as laughable. The entire film is shot in a bright, cartoon-esque way that makes it even more ridiculous, and the costumes and make-up are cheap and tacky. To put it as bluntly as possible, Street Fighter is terrible.",Street Fighter

I can say that this is not good enough if Jackie Chan should play Ryu. I think Lucy Liu should play Chun Li because she should be the one to play and speaks wonderful Cantonese and mandarin. Even Stallone would not make a good Balrog because he is 5 foot 10 inches and weighs over 200 pounds. Even if Stallone is 270 pounds, he still would not be a good Balrog. Raul Julia is not a good M. Bison because he is not Thai. Why not get a male Thai bodybuilder to play M. Bison? I think the cast is not good enough because it is a hard to choose problem.

Admittedly game based movies are maybe one of the hardest genres in existence to convert as gamer expectations are so high.
I'm a gamer and movie addict, but I love this for what it is.
It's not a top line hit for me, but it has lots of fun and entertaining elements.
In the war of fighting games Street Fighter was always the less nitty gritty version of fighters compared to Mortal Kombat and that definitely is how this movie has been filmed, less dark and violent as it could be. I think that was to embrace a wider audience.
I'd hope on day there would still be a remake, just an ultra dark version of it, upping the violence and sfx.",Street Fighter
98,fullenw,Wheres the Action???,7,12 May 2007,"I'm going to cut this film some slack. Movies based on comic books and video games have high expectations to live up to and are open targets for criticism.CAST: There are some recognizable faces in Street Fighter like Jean Claude Van Damme, Miguel Nunez, and Raul Julia. I thought this movie was cast greatly because the actors resemble the video game characters. There are complaints about Van Damme as Guile, seeing as he has an accent and hes not American but physically he was a good choice.Story: They'll be no tournaments or fighting on the streets. The story is basically Bison keeping hostages for ransom.Most of the characters seem thrown in. Anyway, T Hawk and Cammy are Guiles assistants in the army. E Honda, Chun Li and that boxer(forgot his name) work in television/media. DeeJay and Zangeif are Bisons right hand men. Vegas a prize fighter. Ken, Ryu and Sagat had there own stories but got mixed up in the main story.It sucks that Blanka and Dhaslim were poorly represented. Blanka was an experiment gone wrong with no fight scenes. Dhaslim was a scientist and was nothing like a witch doctor. Thats OK though because they're were so many characters you cant heavily focus on all of them.The only thing that always ruined this film for me is the lack of action. Especially with Van Damme you'd expect more action scenes. This movie mainly crams all the action in at the end. *Good note is Guile does that hurricane kick* The action scenes before the end are very brief and disappointing(like when Chun Li goes off on Bison). This movie puts the story ( a weak story at that) ahead of the action and most people prefer that. So its your call. As years passed I learned to appreciate the film for what it was.",Street Fighter

I did stand in line to see it as a 14 year old but they wouldn't let me see it alone because I was too young at the time. Maybe what really happened is the ticketeer didn't want me to waste my money on this hunk of junk. I saw the Santa Clause starring Tim Allen instead and that movie might have been bad but compared to Street Fighter it was Oscar worthy.I actually still have this movie on VHS collecting dust, I taped it off TV and before it was the much better (still terrible) Double Dragon Video Game movie.Only Video Game movie worse then Street Fighter is Mario Brothers.

Bad movie or not i found myself enjoying it. JCVD was not that bad. Raul Julia did a great job as Bison and there would have been a sequel made to this if it werent for his death due to cancer. RIP. Ryu is suppost to be asian..i know in the game he looks white but hes not so im happy that in the movie they made sure he was what he was suppost to be. Him and ken are also not brothers, they were both trained at the same dojo, which is also mentioned in the movie if you pay close enough attention, so this film did not totally mess up the storyline of the game, it actually corrected a few things. I think this was an exciting and enjoyable film if you dont take it seriously, do not listen to pretty much all of the people reviewing this and give this movie a try, its not too bad.",Street Fighter

When the movie was release on December of that year I was one of the first in line to see it. While I was in line I was thinking that this was going to be a great movie it has Van Damme as Guile, and the late Raul Julia as Bison. The movie started and it was all good but 10 minutes later I got the impression that this was not what I expected, 30 minutes later I was starting to get anxious, 40 minutes later people were starting to leave the movie theater, 50 minutes later the theater was half empty, and 60 minutes later I definitely realize that the movie was not what I expected. That night I left the theater with a really bad taste in my mouth. I couldn't sleep that night thinking about the waist of money and time. The movie was awful, the acting was cheesy, the costumes where terrible, and the plot was stupid. It was perhaps the beginning of the end of Van Damme's carrier. Never have I seen such a bad movie.

103,tfc,Cheesy and salty nachos that covers up some real meat so it's worth eating.,6,28 February 2002,"Yes, ""Street Fighter II"" (SF) is based on a video game, yes there is a plot, but it's covered under a cheese sauce. I personally believe this is why SF is being slammed because of this video game connection. However, I have watched it several times and each time it's more entertaining. This is because the movie is really built around Raul Julia's strong performance as the quintessential, over the top megalomaniacal evil dictator M. Bison. Van Damm Plays a likable, but cocky, driven tough good guy that plays the supporting protagonist for Bison (it's all about the bad guy). The rest of the supporting cast play small parts likely based on the video game but are well enough integrated into the plot as not to cause any potholes. These minor characters do add a twist to the plot's irony like, the pacifist Dr. Dhalsim, the simplistic Zangief, the ""geeky"" Dee Jay, and others, that makes Bison's warped dreams possible while offering a great dental plan in a corporate/Nazis workplace. Guile's timid bureaucratic superiors unintentionally aid Bison through appeasement (Chamberland/Hitler). But, back to Bison. Watch Bison because he violates almost every rule in the ""evil overlord rule book"", which makes SF a must see ""B"" movie. And, If one knows the personal quotes used by the most unsavory people who ran/ruined the world in the 20th century. These similar type of quotes are all used by Bison in his villainous monologues. My personal favorite Bison line, ""For you, the day Bison graced (killed) your village was the greatest day of your life. But for me... it was Tuesday."" There are also several art/decor references to serial killers and dictators (i.e. Clown pictures/Gacy). For the kids there are explosions, fights, and cheesy dialog. For the adults there are scientific/ethical/moral/historical undertones to make it a plausible ""what if"" story. Strip the comedy, the silliness, and the absurd extremes, you would have a James Bond-ish film based on some current world events. In a way, SF is a little like Casino Royale (1967), laughable, yet held back a grade for being the class clown that no one takes serious. SF may at first seem like a kiddie pool, but there is a deep end for adults. Like nachos, don't ask which wine goes with it best. Watched SF again in 2017 and raised it from a 5/9 to a 6/9.",Street Fighter

Like the characters, the music, etc. But because it's so terrible, it's what makes it such a fun, enjoyable movie. I've only played one of the Street Fighter games, that being the fourth one. So I watched this film not really expecting a faithful adaptation, but a fun, entertaining mess. The action sequences are so terribly amazing, the characters are laughably cheesy, the acting is so laughably awkward, and the movie has a very frail Raul Julia as Bison. Definitely a guilty pleasure movie at best. The final fight scene was pretty cool and I did like how they added the cliche of the main character supposedly be dead, but when he's really alive. A fun movie! If you like a good guilty pleasure movie, this might be the film for you. If you are a big fan of the video games, you're gonna really hate this movie.",Street Fighter
105,solidgameboy12-1,Why I defend Street Fighter to this day.,7,27 November 2010,"Street Fighter is a strange video game movie. The game is an amazing 2D fighter with a wide array of characters from different continents who battle it out for...something.The Movie, surprisingly, has more plot than you would think. M. Bison (Raul Julia, in his final performance) is now portrayed as a megalomanical super villain who has dreams of causing collapse to the entire world, such as killing a large number of hostages unless paid a ransom worthy of Dr. Evil standards, creating a breed of super soldiers and kidnapping the Queen of England and create his own world based off of his image. Trust me, it is as silly as it sounds.Lt. Guile (Jean Claude Van Damme) approaches the situation in that he has to save the hostages and hopefully put Bison on ice, once and for all, thus stopping his plans for world domination.From there on in, the movie is basically an almost two hour fan service with various subplots with almost all the characters from the Street Fighter universe. Zangief and Dee Jay work for M. Bison as Muscle and Computer Technician, respectively. Chun-Li, Balrog and E. Honda are all out for get revenge and Ken and Ryu are professional fighters hoping to score a battle against the vain Vega and evil Sagat.Like I said, the rest of the movie is nothing short of fan service, since all the actors deliver some truly awful one liners aside, Van Damme's Guile almost sounds like Tommy Wiseau (""The Room"") when you close your eyes, and the whole plot itself is actually quite boring.Well, why in the world would someone defend this movie then? I'll give you three reasons, two are part of the movie, and one is a personal thing.1. Raul Julia's M. Bison. A villain who looks rather powerful should be given a great performance. While Raul Julia did die after this movie was over, there is no denying that he went out with a bang rather than whimper. His performance is laughably over the top, but at no point do you look at his face and see a man who seems to think he's in a movie, and as a result, he makes the movie quite amazing. If anything, he gives us a theatrical villain which, for his character, works very well.2. There was a lot of room for potential here. Let's be honest, writing a movie is easy, but writing a good movie is hard. The director (Who is also the writer) took a fighting video game and crafted a movie out of it, and a fairly well done one at that. Sure, not in execution, but in originality, it works.3. It was a movie from my childhood. I was a child of the 90's, and as such, I can remember my parents letting me watch this at a very young age, and it was awesome. Damn the Nostalgia factor, but it's what makes this movie really good. I can remember how intimidated I was in the final battle scenes, and how cool M. Bison was to me (in that over the top Saturday Morning Cartoon style of cool).This movie is a very easy one to attack for just not being good, but understand from my point of view, even knowing how bad it is, having no character development, some truly cheesy one liners and awful performances, including Van Damme giving a performance that makes him sound like Tommy Wiseau if he smoked cigarettes for ten years and you closed your eyes real tight, I still like it.It's cheesy, terrible and ridiculous, but all you need to know is that Raul Julia delivers some of the best lines for years to come, and you know you are dealing with a kind of cult classic when one of the film's greatest lines is, ""This is merely superconductor electromagnetism. Surely, you've heard of it."" In other words, go see this movie if you haven't already.7/10.",Street Fighter
106,Syrchek,"Bad, really bad",2,2 May 2005,"The first time I saw this movie was in a theater in the fourth (!) grade. Of course back then I had no idea that there is such a thing as criticism when it comes to movies. But I still didn't find it entertaining(about a 100 times less than the video game).About ten years later I found out why I didn't find it entertaining. It's because hands down the movie sucks like a hungry calf sucks a teat. Anyone who has seen it and who is over the age of twelve can tell you that.The last time I saw it is now over a year ago. I thought the acting was god awful, even the representation itself of the characters from the video game (!) was horrible. And don't even get me started on the ridiculous ""plot"". What's also sad is that this was the late Raul Julia's last performance on the big screen. I don't mean to be offensive but that would be a crappy way EVEN for Van Damme to end his appearance on the big screens.Because I was a huge fan of the video game, I will generously give this mess of a film a 2 out of 10 and also because it's one of those movies that make you laugh because they are so bad... 1/5 ..",Street Fighter
107,Pilsung89,"Not the worst, but could've been much better",3,16 April 2008,"I was thrilled when I discovered that there was a Street Fighter movie, because I am a huge fan of the game. When I saw it, though, it was pretty disappointing for what I was expecting. The movie could've have been much better in so many ways.The basic plot is that M. Bison is trying to take over the world with his minions, and Colonel Guile is leading the allied nations forces against his forces. Some other street fighter characters are in the allied nations army. Otheres are civilians with personal vendettas against Bison, others are cons forced into the mix, and others follow Bison.The acting is pretty bad, and I'm not just talking about Van Damme. The only actor who was really good was Raul Julia, perfectly cast as the evil Bison. Some of the others were not good or bad. Also the storyline is very clichéd with many jokes/plots/lines that have been vastly overused or are ridiculous. A good example is where the spokesman for the allied nations says he stopped Guile from taking all the soldiers, and there's 1 cook still on the base. Another example is when Guile has to pretend he's been shot, the medics don't even try to perform CPR or anything. The plot where it looks like the allied nations won't attack was way too quick. It should have been a at least a few minutes long where the characters had to think.The film's worst problem, which defies logic of a Street Fighter movie, is the lack of action. There should have been intense, lengthy fights scenes coming every which way! Instead we are treat to a bunch of quick fight scenes with only a few moves per fight, some of which are not choreographed well at all. Some of the characters from the game don't even throw a single punch! The best fight, and the only one that was really good, was the final fight between Bison and Guile. It was pretty intense and well choreographed. However even it has a flaw. Bison is supposed to be an extremely tough and skilled fighter who can shred any other street fighter. But for a good portion of the fight, Guile is kicking his butt with almost no problem.The plot of the game Street Fighter is to fight off 12 opponents in order to confront and beat Bison. This movie should have been nothing more than all of the street fighter characters entering a world combat tournament and trying to get the chance to defeat Bison. Throw in a few few vendettas and personal reasons to want to defeat Bison, and some dramatic dialogue between actors after the fight scenes, and you would have a classic adaption from the game. This honestly shouldn't have been too difficult. Some might enjoy it, but I didn't. I don't recommend this one.",Street Fighter
108,jwhale9382,"I like this movie. (There, I said it!)",7,4 March 2009,"I didn't get to see this movie when it first came out. A lot of people said it was terrible. I finally saw it on TV in the mid-nineties, and I have to say, I wasn't great, but I wasn't nearly as bad as everyone said it was.The movie is set in the fictional country of Shadaloo, and involves a military showdown between the Allied Nations strike force, and the terrorist army of M. Bison. Bison has captured a group of hostages and will execute them if the A.N. doesn't give in to his demands (typical terrorist threat). Col. Guile steps up to face Bison. Also, other characters from the Street Fighter game get involved either by accident or on purpose.I completely agree that the movie has many gaping plot holes, it's not always coherent, and many parts come off silly. I know most fans were hoping for a serious action movie as opposed to a campy spoof, but in all honesty, it's still entertaining. I think they were trying gear it more towards kids and that's why it was so campy.""Quick! Change the channel!"" Omigosh! That has to be one of the funniest things I've ever heard in my life.One thing I would like to address: Many people claim that his was the movie that tainted the image of Raul Julia. I disagree. If you watch closely, you can tell he's lampooning the role. The result, Bison comes off as a humorous cross between Adolf Hitler, Josef Stalin, Saddam Hussein, and Dr. Evil. It was great. Van Damme does a good job as Col. Guile. He definitely a great job on the fight scenes. Ming Na Wen probably does the most believable performance as Chun-Li, who is probably the most credible character in the movie.Bottom line: While this movie has a weak plot and cheesy acting, it's so silly, that it becomes a ""so bad, it's good"" movie.

And after seeing what they make with street fighter after this movie, and that include the mini-series with zero budget everyone is saying it's good... no it's not. This movie is by no way a masterpiece but it delivers.Why it is a success and make 100 mil at the BOX-OFFICE when it cost barely 35. The kids like it at that time, i know, i was 11 ! It was not PG or G, but it was suitable for children. I was there alone between Christmas and new year's eve. One awesome gift my father gives to me. I also had tons of action figures and vehicules that year. You know what... it's 2017 and I still have them. It was based on the GI Joe.The way they built Guile was right. He need to be strong and look good. Cammy was MILF all the way ! Chun-Li OK a reporter but when she fights, she is a beast. Bullrog, E. Honda are fun and have chemistry. Ken and Ryu are right on target ! Always see them as friends just like the Double Dragon team of Billy and Jimmy Lee.The villains are fun as hell. I remember hating so much Raul Julia because he was right on target with his Bison performance. The man deliver his last live performance before passing away and that's sad. Truly a highlight here.The only storyline I found a big boring is the one with Carlos Blanka and Dhalsim. They have chemistry, it's just that it's bland and a bit bad. Blanka should have become that huge beast and kill tons of people at the end.Andrew Bryniarski is the only Zangief i will believe. Jay Tavare was made for Vega role. Too bad there is no sequels or spin off. That man will have made a perfect Vega live film. Imagine him fighting Wolverine/Logan ! oooh ! Maybe the film has not aged too well, many complains about the change... try to make a good film out of a Street Fighter game when there is NO storyline... good luck !

114,vkn,A poor film in itself and a terribly bad adaption of the games.,2,15 April 2001,"Anyone with a fondness for videogames is bound to be familiar with the Street Fighter franchise. Those who grew up or were around during the big home console boom have even very probably played some version of Street Fighter 2 to death and know the characters quite well. And to those, it will be blatantly obvious how -wrong- this choppy adaption of the game is. People bad-mouth the Super Mario Bros movie for being too loosely based on the games, but the Street Fighter film is much worse in that department. So much in fact, that this almost looks like an alternate universe version of the Street Fighter saga, and not a very pretty one either.As usual with videogame adaptions (especially fighting game ones), one shouldn't really expect anything of earth-shattering levels. Most of us will be satisfied just to see the characters from the games fleshed out on the screen and strutting their stuff for a bit. Well, not so here. There's some kind of silly plot going on about rescuing a bunch of hostages from flipped dictator wannabe M. Bison. Oh well, any excuse would be good enough to have the characters from the games appear and beat each other up, but the movie starts to do everything frighteningly wrong almost right from the start.Primo, some bright spark decided that almost all the characters had to be completely changed from their game selves. I'm all for originality, but this just ends up looking embarassing. The grim and mighty Sagat from the games turns into a dopey-looking smuggler of sorts, Ryu and Ken are cast as bunch of semi-outlaw ruffians instead of the worthy warriors we know (also note that the Yank actors don't even know how to pronounce Ryu's name. If I was called Ryu, I'd slap the face of someone who called me ""Rai-yoo""), and it goes on and on. To fans of the game, a lot of this will seem terribly clumsy, if not downright insulting to the characters they know and love. Beefy Russian Zangief was never a faithful servant of Bison's, and neither was Dee Jay (Balrog the boxer has also changed sides suddenly and is one of the goodies...and a news reporter at that). The whole shebang just seems like a total mess, thrown together after just playing the game for two minutes. The way Blanka and Dahlsim were turned into complete farces speaks volumes.It's doubly painful to see how shoddy this has become when you consider how easily all these mistakes could've been avoided. Unlike a number of other game adaptions, there is some simple, yet solid base material for a film to be found in the Street Fighter games. The movie could've taken on a more linear path, describing a big martial arts tournament just like in the games, where everyone has their own (sometimes slim) reasons for competing and taking on Bison. It would perhaps have been unoriginal, in a Bloodsport-on-acid kind of way (side note; Bloodsport actually reminds one much more of the Street Fighter games than this film, with a ""world warrior"" flavor clearly present in there), but at least it would've done it's job of turning a game into a film properly.The way it is now, the character's names and costumes are the only slight similiarities to the games (plus a few teeny-tiny references). Overall it's just a messy and corny film, that's more like a trippy action movie for young children rather than a film based on the games. It doesn't even resemble a martial arts movie very much. Sure, there are fight scenes, but they're not quite Bruce Lee (Fei Long is missing from the movie, by the way), and are hampered by cheesy lines and dumb hampering around. Most of the action you get here would feel more at home in a standard ""run around and blow everything up"" kind of film. This is not so much a Street Fighter movie as just a forgettable action/warfare film on caffeine.Although the cast features some big names, one really has to wonder who came up with the bright idea of casting Raul Julia as a flipped dictator (who's even supposed to be a grandissimo martial artist. No, seriously). It's nice to see Van Damme again, though the day-glo yellow rinse they did for his hair won't go down well with everyone. And seriously, if you're going to star him in a film, at least have him strip off large amounts of kit at some point.In a nutshell, this is a travesty. The film fails miserably at everything it tries to do. Still, at least there's an anime version of the game (several ones, in fact) that does a more faithful and overall far better job, I'm told. Just goes to show you that Japanese games are better off being adapted by Japanese studios. Or studios who have some kind of clue, for that matter.",Street Fighter
115,Emphinix,So corny that it killed the game with stupid sense of humor,3,16 January 2007,"As a big fan of the Street Fighter video games and anime movies and series, I gotta say that this movie was very corny that killed the Street Fighter feeling. Most of the characters of the movie were totally butchered. This is a terrible video game based movie just like Double Dragon.Van Damme was horrible making a fool out of himself by playing as Guile with a corny accent. For example, this is how all of the characters were butchered.Chun Li was never a reporter, she's a detective working for the Interpol and plotting her revenge on Bison for her father's death.Ryu and Ken were never a pair of small time hustlers, they were trained under their master Gouken. Ryu is always wandering in places seeking his rival and Ken is a rich guy who is Ryu's best friend.Guile was never the main character of the game.Charlie was presumed to be killed by Bison and he was never Blanka. Blanka is a monster named Jimmy who disappeared in a plane crash.Cammy and T-Hawk were never part of Guile's army.Sagat was never an arms dealer and he is a muay thai champion and Ryu's rival.Dee Jay was never a bad guy. He is a Jamaican rapper and fighter, not a computer genius.I do not remember Balrog being one of the good guys.And Sawada was never part of the game story. Steven E. Souza was afraid to put Fei Long since it payed tribute to Bruce Lee.AND Shadaloo is supposed to be Bison's narcotics group that smuggles drugs and guns worldwide, not a city.What I can say of this story is that it is stupid, corny and a total waste of time.I give this movie a 4 out of 10.",Street Fighter
116,Vassago,"Wants to be entertaining, not violent - that's why some people don't like it",10,27 April 2000,"Aside from Jean Claude van Damme's traditionally wooden performance, this movie is quite entertaining - that's because it is planned as a funny spoof of fighting movies rather than a cruel beat'em up. This is also what the game on which it is based was originally all about - fun rather than violence, parody rather than blood. Unfortunately, the movie attracted mainly people who expected cruel, violent massacre and were angry not to see it - an audience obviously not high enough to see and appreciate dozens of little jokes scattered throughout the movie (there are some, which are quite obvious - such as the parody of Japanese monster movies from the 1950s - and others, which require a more careful look - such as the lovely scene with the drawing, a parody showing Bison as Hitler, with a similar ""creative"" ambition and similarly ridiculous results!). The script was apparently too good for most of the audience who expected more of a violent fight such as ""Mortal Kombat the Movie"" - which those people obviously liked more. However, unlike any other ""fighting"" films, this one you might show to your kids and people who dislike ""fighter"" films - that is because Street Fighter is a harmless fighting comedy rather than a violent fighting action feature.",Street Fighter
117,asiduodiego,This is why you shouldn't make movies based on videogames,2,26 March 2011,"Here's the thing: videogames are NOT movie material. Period. In videogames, the story serves just one goal: to lead us into the game. The characters are NOT developed on purpose, the idea is the player fills the blank spots with his imagination... and I just can't figure out who thought anyone was filling ""Colonel Guile's"" space with a Belgian dude.Seriously, this movie is just boring garbage. Its more shameful flaw is that it's the last Raul Julia movie: he was in some stupid movies before (such as ""Overdrawn at the Memory Bank""), but, he was a great actor, and he should have been redeemed after this garbage... but life is cruel sometimes.There is really not much to say about this movie: boring characters, boring story, laughable performances, strange plot-devices (Dr. Dhalsim?).

I mean who would cast Raul Julia as Bison or singer Kylie Minouge as Cammy (even though she did look hot in her army uniforms). Some characters were too predictable like the boxer, the sumo, the scientist, and even Guile were predictable.Mainly I say if it had better actors or better acting it might have been better but no.

It's stupid and nonsensical, with silliness that doesn't belong, and explosions where there shouldn't be, and Van Damme out of his element (but then again, this movie IS a big P.O.S.--so maybe he's IN his element). The plot involves M. Bison taking on the world and demanding the payment of 20 billion dollars so that he will release the hostages. Whether he does that or not doesn't really matter because there's so much else going on that we tend to forget about a few plot points here and there. It's only until they spring up again does anyone go, ""Oh, right, I forgot about this thing. It's still going on?""So why did I give this a 6? Does that seem a little high to you? Probably. Critics despise it. Fans of the games despise it. It's got a 3.7 on IMDb. I haven't played the games. I'm not officially a critic. And unlike a lot of critics and would-be critics, I enjoy some terrible movies as guilty pleasures. Max Payne, Spirit of Vengeance, Double Impact, etc. etc. etc.. Street Fighter isn't much of an exception. It's got the energy of a Saturday morning cartoon, and it's twice as fun as most PG-13 action films these days--which, in a way, is kind of sad.

Neither of us liked it.As a fan its confusing, even baffling why they changed so many characters backstory (Charlie doesn't die, instead he becomes Blanka?!), looks and even ethnicity (Honda is Hawaiian), it gets to a point where it takes you ages to recognize certain characters, although they are some of the most iconic things in pop-culture. Why didn't they just take one of the countless stories from the universe and made it into a movie, there even is a fully fleshed out SF II story, which they claim the movie is based on. There are also VERY few SF moves, none of them have famous quotes from the games and bisons moves are artificially made with machines. I could go on for ages about this part, so lets just skip to the ""not-fan-perspective""...Apart from the fact that this feels like a terrible secret agent plot there are much more severe things wrong. There are too many characters crammed into the movie, yet we don't get any motivation for the majority for them, it just feels like they are there, because they had to be in the movie, also we don't care about them.

123,tweiss1981,I don't care what anyone says...I like this movie!,10,17 March 2001,"Why is this film getting such miserable reviews?  I, for one, loved it.  The game and the movie can be two separate worlds, and still get their points across.  (Sorry, ""Disney's Inspector Gadget"" doesn't count)I read in a Gamepro magazine from July, 1994 where Steven E. De Souza (director) discussed some details in this movie.  He did say that all 16 characters would appear, though some briefly.  This movie wasn't trying to be a clone of the game...it was trying to exist on its own terms and merits, off today's headlines, so a few changes were made.  (I appreciate originality) The problem they did have was, the way this movie was being made, they had too many heroes and too few villains, so, to make this movie work, they needed to make a few changes.  Some characters will switch sides. (ie. Balrog, the American boxer, known to the Japanese as M. Bison, is now a good guy, while DeeJay and Zangief, the kickboxer and the Russian, are aides for Bison)  In the October 1994 issue, a later annoucement was made that everyone but Fei Long would appear.  (I'll discuss it later)  But, still, most of the other characters do appear on their respective sides, in one way or another.  Guile, Chun-Li, Ken, Ryu, Honda, Dhalsim, Cammy, T. Hawk and Blanka are all good, while M. Bison, Sagat and Vega are still bad. 
Also, I do like the new story they gave Blanka.  The options were: a young boy named Jimmy lost and raised in the jungles of Brazil, or a soldier named Charlie (Guile's friend in the game, who Bison murders)taken prisoner and mutated into a beast.  I mean, the former is something right out of Tarzan and the Jungle Book.  The latter plot must have pleased the CapCom execs, otherwise they wouldn't have permitted it!I see Sawada as a stand-in for Fei Long.  If he was in this movie (a Hong Kong movie actor) he'd probably get a wise-guy personality, making him like Ken Masters, the less serious of the two Shotokan students, and Johnny Cage of Mortal Kombat.  It wouldn't be Street Fighter without Ken, so, no Fei Long.  All in all, this is a cool movie.  Better than the Super Mario Bros. and Double Dragon movies.  And unlike Mortal Kombat, it can work on its own, without the game behind it.  It may be mindless fun, but hey, at least it's fun.  I thought Van Damme made a good Guile (he seems to stand up for everything good and right, making him a well-respected SF character), and Raul Julia really went out with a bang (no pun intended) as evil Major Bison.  If you can, also try the American Street Fighter cartoon.  (I have a comment on it, too) And if you hate this movie still, you'll love it after Paul Anderson releases that Resident Evil movie.",Street Fighter
124,Tanuccoon,"Terrible? Perhaps. However, it's still terribly funny.",10,3 November 2007,"A list of good movie adaptations of popular video-games is unsurprisingly short. The material, in terms of story-line, characters, etc, really doesn't lend itself to movies. However, that's never deterred even somewhat ambitious studios out to make a quick buck and, in rare instances, these studios unintentionally create a gem.Street Fighter is not a movie to be taken seriously. The plot is unimpressive, the casting is terrible, and you'd be hard-pressed to find a line of dialogue that can be spoken with a straight face. However, all of these seemingly awful elements come together beautifully in one of the greatest examples of camp that the movie industry has ever churned out. Almost every line is quotable due to how unintentionally (or maybe intentionally) bad it is. The entire movie is basically one huge comedy with three minutes of seriousness, in the form of a speech, towards the end with intermittent fight scenes.Fans of the Street Fighter franchise will, most likely, hate this film on general principle. Producers cast the physically diminutive Raul Julia as the power-mad General Bison, relative unknowns as Ryu and Ken, few characters resemble their video game counter-parts (Jean-Claude is possibly the closest fit), and the writers took many liberties with the characters' backgrounds. Likewise, fans of action flicks will be unimpressed (or possibly even annoyed) by the lackluster fight scenes, weak (but strangely hilarious) story, and the like.However, despite (or rather, because) of its flaws, this movie is a great laugh and I'd highly recommend seeing it with a few friends just so you'll have someone nearby that you can turn around to and ask, ""Did he really just say that?""",Street Fighter
125,willhaskew,A glutted Hollywood train wreck,2,5 March 2015,"Video games make horrible movies. This schlock was based on the most popular 2D fighting game of its day and was gobbled up by Hollywood. It diverged highly from the game story line (which admittedly was not very well suited to a live action film) with B-movie martial arts actor Jean Claude Van Damme as Guile, the Special Ops soldier from the USA, as commander of a U.N.- like group of peace keeping soldiers fighting M. Bison (Vega), dictator of a small nation called Shadaloo. It doesn't help any there's no mention of any tournament and Ryu, Street Fighter II's real protagonist, is demoted to a glorified cameo along side Ken Masters. Characters like Balrog, T. Hawk, Blanka and Dhalsim are all after thoughts as well. When you think about how ridiculous just the attempt to portray Blanka (think The Incredible Hulk with Lou Ferrigno cheesy) was, one has to wonder why they made a film at all? For some reason they also attempted to combine Blanka and Charlie from the Street Fighter Alpha series together into one character. If you believe the Wikipedia article about this movie, Van Damme and Raul Julia's salaries ate up most of the $35 million budget (hard to believe Mr. Spinning Side Kick of Death made $8 million for this crap). Van Damme was also notoriously carrying on an affair during production with co-star Kylie Minogue while his then-wife was pregnant. Sadly Raul Julia made his final movie appearance in a throwaway role as M. Bison. Conclusion is that this was a giant greedy cash grab by Capcom. There are some supernatural elements missing like Bison's Psycho Power or Ryu's Hadouken technique which given the aggressive filming schedule, the cobbled together screenplay and bad casting choices would've probably looked horrendous in this movie any how. It's a movie to avoid for most unless you are feeling extra nostalgic, a first time viewer who isn't bored easily or maybe just a hardcore Street Fighter fan.",Street Fighter

141,ccomley,Unutterably dire,1,6 December 2004,"This film entirely fails. It fails to engage, it fails to entertain, it even fails to amuse. Based on a video game, with some attempt to create a ""comic book"" style, but there's no meat on the bones, and the bones are rickety. VanDamme is VanDamme. When it comes time to kick someone, he's your man. Up until then, he looks pretty. Why has someone tattooed a US flag on his shoulder? Minogue is very easy on the eye, especially in the blue vest. And she isn't singing. But there's any number of ways of admiring pictures of Minogue and most of them can be effected without having to hear her singing if it's not to your taste! Ming-Na is also easy on the eye especially in the very silly dress or the black catsuit, and she's not quite so ubiquitous, so that could be this is the film's saving grace. She also has the only role that comes close to having anything in it to work with. Raol Julia tried hard, but even here the character just doesn't work. I suggest you watch The Addams Family, which is brilliantly written and really gives Julia a chance to show his not inconsiderable talents.At the end of the day, this is a waste of good celluloid. Watch something else. Anything.",Street Fighter

First there was the $10 for the ticket, the $5 for the pop corn and soda, and then $50 to clean the guys clothes I puked on. This movie made me sick.

143,skradji,Street Fighter film not recommended for the most hardcore fans more of Street Fighter.,8,10 October 2014,"A film that arouses feelings. On the one hand as an adaptation of the famous game is not true, but as film itself, however, is very funny, precisely because it does not take itself seriously.The problem is that given a perhaps too caricature parody or tone, rather than as a one hundred percent serious film in every way. The film has humor, but went with it, so that really was hard to take it seriously. Then there's that created a sort of parallel universe, many characters changing sides and giving them a different role or the video game as Balrog, Sagat deejay or appearance. However, it is not an absolute mess, as entertaining as it is quite drinkable. Among the most positive, we can say that the film is so psychedelic and surreal and such a colorful and lively picture that is nice to see, as a kind of bizarre comic. The presence of Raul Julia, his gestures and exaggerated poses and a great and wicked sense of humor, a dictator are the most memorable of the film, and in fact the character of bison is really the only well-focused and tailored all film. Van Damme is on his line, he does what he does best, and even like him for the way he laughs at himself. Actress Ming Na, however, I find it much more believable and sexy as that Kristin Kreuk ChunLi, but putting it as a journalist was a total mistake, journalist should have been a simple camouflage to infiltrate the fortress of bison as part a plan of interpol. Anyway, I also thought it was a bad video game adaptation that not a bad movie, because I always liked and I sported small and still does, but after seeing that stupid movie of street fighter: the legend of Chin Li, made ​​this even more I liked him and had even more affection than he already had. !For Raul Juliá, Vaya con Dios!.",Street Fighter

But the idea was genius!!!!!!!!!,8,14 February 2003,"DANIEL MANIA COMMENT #10This was one of the greatest box office travisties in the history of film!!!! I admit that Van Damn was the best person to play Colonel Guile and Raul Julia was a great M.Bison but the rest of the entire film was left in shambles!! Why Oh Why??!!!!!!!! First of all there were no decent special effects in the entire film. Second, the costume designer should have been drug out into the street and shot after the film's premier!!!!! Blanka looked like E.T. on steriods and why the hell was Balrog rolling with Chun Li Zhang.  Here are some questions I have for the producer and director of this film!!!Why did Vega have black hair?? Why was D.J. a computer hacker??? Why were the two actors who played Ryu and Ken casted???? Where were the special effects?????!!!! Why was T-Hawk with the A.N.??????  I would just like to know.Ok the movie was very bad, however, I do suggest that it be added to your Martial Arts dvd collection because of it's genius concept. I mean the story was great and the martial arts choreography was ok minus the so-called special moves!!!! This is an 8/10 and nothing more and the only reason I don't scorch this film with a 2/10 is because of the idea in general and the story.Once again this is Daniel K.

I thought Van Damme did alright as Guile and Raul Julia puts in a good final performance R.I.P. There are too many characters and are not are given enough screen time to show what they can do .It has a simple storyline to follow, decent action scenes, the film never has a problem with pacing, rolling along fittingly enough to keep you interested. Some decent acting by other actors. The props are bright and the colourful costumes and also a change in filming locations other than America which makes a change.In conclusion watch it if your a van damme fan (i'm a fan)and street fighter fan as your favourite characters come to life but don't take it seriously otherwise you won't enjoy.Overall a decent action flick.",Street Fighter

148,duffyboy666,Makes the bastardisation of Batman by Joel Schumacher look like a fine tuning job!,1,21 November 2005,"If you were to ever walk into a video games arcade in the early to mid 90's, you would often come across the game known as Street Fighter. Made by Capcom, it's what passed for Tekken in those days although it's still kinda going now. It's a basic 2D fighting game like Mortal Kombat (without the gore) although 3D versions were released in the late 90's Playstation era.And yeah it had its moments. I remember Christmas 95' when the New Challengers version was released. Hours of fun of me and my brother kicking each others heads in over the second controller! Although one memory that it would do well to forget ever happened, would be the reason why you're reading this review in the first place, it's movie based on the series.Street Fighter the Movie is like the first turn on the left as you drive along Hollywood's tunnel of shame. With Red Zone Cuba, Manos and Gigli being at the far depths....but hey let's not go there of course. It is a truly awful horrible film that deserves no part whatsoever in anyone's movie collection, with the exception of Joel and the bots.I know I'm often one to talk about dubious achievements so I might as well get this little tid-bit out of the way. Street Fighter the Movie is the worst ever movie based on a video game. And the video game based on this movie, is the worst ever video game based on a movie! Amazing how it holds both titles.Remember how most sensible Batman fans felt after seeing what Joel Schumacher did to the caped crusader? That's how Street Fighter fans will have felt after seeing this hateful wreck. It takes all the characters, stories and personalities and puts them in a blender. And then decides to convey them with some awful F-Grade actors and terrible role play.Now one of the excuses that the producers of this mess gave was that they weren't sure how to fit people into roles and find the right actors with a low budget. Fraid that doesn't pass Pedro. Just look at the original Mortal Kombat movie. It was no masterpiece, but it still stuck the the roots or the games story and considering it was a low budget, they didn't do all that badly in terms or actors and personalities, and the finished product (although formulaic) was tolerable.Anyone who even has a rough idea of the Street Fighter games before this was released would be able to tell you the following three things. 1) Ken and Ryu are the main characters. 2) Guile is an All- American boy scout. And 3) Chun Li was one of the weakest characters in the game apart from her lightning kick.OK....So why Mr Director, even though even the most average gamer knows these three things, how come 1) Ryu and Ken take a back seat as B-characters?! 2) Guile is a muscle bound machine with a french accent?! 3) Chun Li is one of the best fighters?! To call the casting bad is an understatement! Which brings me onto the two main players in this debacle. Raul Julia and Jean Claude Van Damme. Raul Julia was ill during this movie and was in no position to play the top bad guy, M.Bison. Whose role is reduced from super-villain to a mere crime boss! And since JCVD is playing a character that he's nothing in common with, the result?....The final fight scene is basically JCVD destroying M.Bison.You're telling me that THAT passes as a final fight scene? Get out of here. As a matter of fact, I think I'll get out of here. Look at any other video game action movie, particularly Mortal Kombat or Doom and you'll see where this appalling movie went wrong.Don't Watch This Movie.",Street Fighter

In the asian nation of Shadaloo City, civil war has erupted between the forces of drug lord-turned Bison and the Allied Nations led by Guile. Bison has captured several A.N. relief workers, and via a live two-way radio broadcast, demands Guile secure a US$20 billion ransom in three days. Guile refuses and vows to track Bison down, but his assistant, Sergeant Cammy, is only partially able to pinpoint Bison's location to the river-delta region outside the city. One hostage is Guile's friend Sergeant Carlos ""Charlie"" Blanka, who Bison orders taken to his lab for his captive doctor and scientist, Dhalsim, to turn into the first of his supersoldiers. Though Charlie is severely disfigured by the procedure, Dhalsim secretly alters his cerebral programming to maintain Charlie's humanity.

Don't believe the people who says this is a bad movie. Sure, it's not the best movie ever made, but it's still watchable.Fun fact: In 'Street Fighter' Raul Julia plays a dictator, while in 'Moon over Parador' he's the right-hand man of the paradorian dictator, Alphonse Simms.",Street Fighter
150,siektwo,what a letdown...,3,22 March 2005,"wow. this is an ""action movie"" with Van Damme that is based on a FIGHTING GAME for home video game consoles.Sounds like it could be pretty cool huh? wrong. where's the action anyways? there's a couple of fight scenes in the film, but nothing is even close to impressive.Isn't the reason WE (van damme fans) watch films like this for the fighting? So much potential, but the film would rather wallow around in the cheesiest plot line ever...as opposed to giving fans a lot of kick ass fight scenes.The film attempts to throw a bunch of the popular video game characters into the film, if only to have them in there and nothing else. It was a tremendous letdown to see the character ""Vega"" turn into such a wimp. Vega didn't even do much fighting either...very disappointing.The bright spots are Raul Julia's character, ""M Bison"". Although, its a sad film for such a great actor to leave on (RIP). There's also some humorous moments (intentionally) that made me chuckle, but those moments also took away from the film at the same time.CLIFF NOTES: hardly any real action, mostly some cheesy gun battles. when the fight scenes did happen, they weren't anything impressive...especially since most of them DIDN'T have van damme in them. The film gets stuck in trying to make a plot and throw as many characters from the popular video game into the mix.

You have to go to the Schwarzeneggers, the Stallones, and to a lesser extent, the Van Dammes.""I've seen and enjoyed many excessively violent films featuring actors such as Stallone and Schwarzeneggers. However one of the things that I found utterly appalling in this film was the graphic nature of how many people have their necks broken.

I got to see it and it was really bad. It turned out to be a war movie more than just your average martial arts movie. Reasons why I hate this movie 1. It is suppose to be about a tournament not a freakin search & rescue operation. 2. Why is the setting is in a city called ""Shadaloo?"" FYI Shadaloo is a criminal organization lead by M. Bison. And the setting should take place around the world! 3. Ryu is suppose to be the main character instead he plays a minor role and along with Ken they're like from the mafia or something. Guile is the main character and plays a major role. What's up with that? 4. Why is Charlie Blanka? Charlie is dead/Blanka is young boy named Jimmy. 5. Dhalsim is the master of Yoga why is he a scientist? 6. Sagat is a Muay Thai emperor not a arms dealer. 7. Zangief and Dee Jay are not Shadaloo members they don't have any important roles. 8. Chun Li is suppose to be a Interpol agent, E. Honda is a Sumo wrestler, and Balrog is a Shadaloo member. They're not reporters! 9.

I was so pumped and excited to finally see this movie. It was almost that feeling that Star Wars geeks get at new Star Wars premiers and then.....the movie started. Ha ha, oh man this movie was just so terrible in it's live action format. The characters were poorly embodied by their actors. They weren't dead on either. Doctor Dhalsim? Gimme a break! This movie is just awful. I remember the theater being packed and as the movie kept going I just started to slouch and hide in my seat. I was just embarrassed to be watching this fiasco of a movie. The acting is terrible, the plot is terrible, everything is a mess. I just couldn't wait for it to end. When it did, I just wanted to get the hell out of the theater as soon as possible so that no one I knew would know I just sat through that movie. Avoid this movie at all costs. Mortal Kombat 1 is a far superior movie to this garbage and takes it's approach a lot more serious. Street Fighter doesn't amuse or entertain or even make you laugh, it just deserves to get flushed down the toilet. Street Fighter 2 the Animated Movie is a lot better and their characters are identical to those of the video game. No ridiculous flipping kicks by Van Damme either. A 1 out of 10.

I don't think there are too many actors out there that were at home playing video-games at the time, lets face it they are a little more busy. So they did what they could, read some of the comics and did their best, which i have to say was pretty impressive, especially since most games at the time were more considered for the teen consumer.The Movie has a few Gags and the fighting styles are a little humorous, take the time to put yourself in mind that this movie might have been more than a challenge to make at that point in time and don't be to serious with it, enjoy the film as a kid comedy and I'm sure it will be much more appealing if you are looking for a violent no holds bars kind of movie i'd think about another film.

I don't think I pumped more quarters or lost more brain cells in the screen of any other video game. I think I beat the game with every single character 2 or 3 times. So when I saw a commercial of a Street Fighter movie, my 12 year old heart went like a jack hammer. I never saw the movie in theatres, though. Disappointed, as most of my friends said it was 'AAAwwwwsome!!"" 'No worries"" I figured. I'll rent it. It was, without question, one of the worst movies ever made. I was able to come to this conclusion at age 12! TWELVE! At age twelve, any move with blood, or lasers, or pointless violence and/or explosions, AND Jean-Claude Van Damme was indeed 'AAAwwwwsome!!' But STREET FIGHTER was so unimaginably terrible that I almost stopped playing the game, my FAVORITE game ever, altogether. I couldn't imagine continuing to play a game whose subsequent movie cost me a good 25 points of my IQ. I did continue to play the game though, after a brief hiatus, on the simple basis that the movie had jacked the game up so badly, and had changed so many things around, they were too different things. That was the last Jean Claude Van Damme movie I ever saw, and looking back over the last  8 years, (actually, the last [however long Van Damme's been making movies] years) that was a fine decision my part.What's worse was this was the final film that the great Raul Julia made before his untimely death. Sometimes I jokingly think that watching this movie is what did him in. On imdb.com's rating scale, I gave this movie a 1. Forced generosity on their part.

But with less budget.,1,21 December 2016,"I can just imagine the executive conversation that led up to this ""movie"". ""Hey!

The one guy that kinda wrote Die Hard is on the payroll, But I could only afford him as a writer if I agreed to let him direct as well, what could possibly go wrong?"" And 35 million dollars later? Everything went wrong! Thats what! Street fighter is a remarkably sad and ham fisted excuse of a ""movie"". What a waste of film stock and electricity this is. Even by ""movie based on a video game"" standards, Street fighter really is a steaming pile excrement and is shadowed by really ""good"" video game movies like the super Mario bro's and wing commander. It is an insult to any human that this abomination of entertainment exists at all. The acting is possibly the funniest part of this farce, I know Jean Claude is no Lawrence Olivier, but in other movies he at least does a convincing job of learning his lines well enough not to have to read them off the auto- prompt. I think at one point you can even see his eyes scanning the for the next line. Looks like the director diddnt bother to consider things like acting to be that important, because the entire cast including the ones with actual acting careers sounded like they were performing in a high school amateur dramatics production that was directed by someone on the PTA. Cardboard sets, cheesy one liners that sound like they should have been written for Adam West in a reject Batman TV series episode from the 60's. No detectable story line to speak of, an all star cast and potentially winning franchise. How better to waste 35 million bucks? If I was in this movie, I would be so embarrassed that I would probably kill myself. Why am I writing about it?

167,spikeprime,"Silly, flawed, bizarre, but AMAZING",8,25 November 2020,"Look, I'm not going to pretend this is technically a good movie from an objective sense. It's not, and we all know that it's not. Its mis-steps and foibles are many and varied, and in a story sense, it hardly resembles the game it is based on (not that there was much plot in the game, or games in general, back in the 90s).However, when you consider what they had to work with, it's a miracle this film came out as well as it did. It's easily one of the best transitions from videogames to movie theatres. Admittedly, there's not a lot of competition as there hasn't really been a legit ""good"" movie based on a game in the long and storied history of adaptations.There are, however, a LOT of positives to this film. Raul Julia, for example, is utterly magnificent as M. Bison in this film. He truly captured what made Bison such a compelling villain, and surprisingly manages to pull off that silly costume with class and style. He apparently researched a great deal for this role, looking into how historical dictators have spoken, and discussing the character of Bison with his children, Street Fighter 2 fans themselves. He takes the role completely seriously, giving a straight performance. In the scene between himself and Chun-Li (her backstory taken right out of the game, almost exactly -- with the exception she's a reporter instead of working for Interpol now), he sells every moment. He follows her dramatic monologue about how he ruined her life with simple words:""For you, the day Bison graced your village was the most important day of your life. But for me... it was Tuesday.""That's not just a good performance, it's honestly good writing in itself. Raul Julia and Ming-Na-Wen are both stellar actors, and they bounced off each other incredibly well during that scene in particular. Even the music of the scene was great, enhancing the tone and feel expertly.The jokes of the film are a mixed bag. Some, like the famous ""Quick, change the channel!"" line of Sagat's still gets a good laugh, even from people who hate this film. Others have either aged badly, or were never funny in the first place. Though there is a lot to be said for unintentional hilarity in scenes which were (I think?) supposed to be taken seriously.The biggest weakness, in my opinion, is Jean-Claude Van-Damme. In all honesty, he is and always has been a discount, low-rent, lamer and less interesting version of Arnold Schwarzenegger. He has no charm, charisma, acting talent or even fighting prowess, leaving much of his stunts and battling to others. That last point usually isn't a problem, but in a film based on a fighting game, it does make it less convincing and more boring whenever Van-Damme is on screen. IMO, they should have gotten a better actor. Even the aforementioned talented cast such as Raul Julia and Ming-Na-Wen struggle to hold the film while Van-Damme is on camera, sucking the life and charm out of every scene he's in.Looking past that, it's mostly a fun film with colourful and lively characters, a bizarre and self-aware ridiculous plot, mostly a good cast with funny scenes (even when they're not supposed to be), and is the final film of Raul Julia's entire career before his too-soon departure from us.It's not perfect, but I'd be lying if I said it wasn't a tonne of fun. If anything I said makes you interested in this film, please do yourself a favour, ignore the bad reviews and just give it a watch.8/10, would watch again.",Street Fighter
168,Staack117,A tale of disbelief...,1,19 November 1999,"Rarely am I so aghast that I'm left unable to speak, and this movie was able to do it.  Really, I'm left wondering if this was just the most ill-conceived idea for a video game-to-movie translation, or a brilliant work of evil.  I understand the rigors of making a successful story out of a multi-character (with no absolute main 'star' character) game that has multiple plotlines and viewpoints...  I understand how difficult it is to please fans of all the characters, by including as many as possible.  But, brother, this is almost as bad as most of those old Hanna Barberra cartoons, like the Super Globetrotters or Galaxy Trio.  All the famous Capcom characters (all of which ooze personality) are reduced to shallow bastardized versions of their former selves.  They portray the menace and horrors of war with as much depth as a Three Stooges Short, only the Stooges have better fighting scenes.  It's not that the cast doesn't have the skill, they were just too busy degrading their Capcom counterparts to do anything special.But all of this adds to one hell of a jaw-dropping movie.  It sucks so hard, you are forced to figure that it was intentional just to see how low they could go.A french actor with an accent thicker than L.A. smog, portraying a clean-cut all-american soldier (who is, according to Capcom, actually a Major)? What's wrong, did Arnold Schwarzenegger ask for too much money?",Street Fighter
169,saxon_princess,A good and enjoyable movie,10,24 April 2007,"Okay, so not all of my family agrees on the movie. But, I enjoyed it from the first time I saw it on T.V. The two main actors, Raul Julia and Jean-Claude Van Damme portray their characters well, though Kylie Monigue turned me off her character a little. Be in mind that being based on a video game it can not be perfected to follow the games exactly. In general the movie is centred around two forces based in Shadaloo, where A.N. (Allied Nation) hostages are taken by General M. Bison (Raul Julia) and unless is demands are met, he'll kill every single hostage is has. It is up to the U.N. leader, military commanding officer Colonel William F. Guile and his army to rescue them. They are joined along the way, under unfortunate circumstances, by a ninja journalist Chun-Li Zang (the voice of Mulan) her two friends a former sumo-wrestler E. Honda (Peter Navy Tuiasosopo) and former boxer Balrog (Grand L. Bush) as well as two thieves, Ryu Hoshi (Bryon Mann) and Ken Masters (Damian Chapa). A good enjoyable movie with some light class actors and a well thought out plot . Okay so not every person in the world will love this, but when you want something for a rainy day (like it is out here) then this is the type of movie I'd recommend. Overall I gave it 10/10 because not only is Jean-Claude Van Damme one of my favourite actors, everyone of his movies entertains me greatly, not to mention the awesome fighting scenes. For fans of Jean-Claude Van Damme who have not seen many of his movies I recommend that you see The Replicant, Timecop and maybe Universal Soldier (if you don't mind a little bit of a corny actors based around him).",Street Fighter
170,Comiccritic83,The most underrated video game movie ever,8,20 September 2005,"9/20/2005WARNING! THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS! IF YOU HAVE NOT SEEN THIS MOVIE YET, PLEASE DON'T READ THIS REVIEW!Still with me? Good.""Street Fighter"" is based off of the video game series of the same name, though it is more popularly known for ""Street Fighter II"" with its vast assortment of heroes and villains. The movie features the same characters from the game and three from another Street Fighter game. Instead of a World Warrior tournament of fighters like in the game, the movie focuses on General M. Bison (the late, talented Raul Julia) wanting world domination in pure James Bond villain style, with a vast secret hideout and dozens of henchmen. Bison has taken 63 hostages and demands 20 billion dollars to be given to him in three days for their return. Bison is also working on a super-soldier program (isn't that Captain America territory?), in which Dr. Dhalsim (Roshan Seth) is unwillingly mutating Guile's captured friend, Carlos Blanka (Robert Mammone), into a green-skinned, orange-haired man-beast (think orange Don King hair on the Hulk, but not as strong or muscular).The Allied Forces are fighting Bison's troops and Colonel William Guile (Jean-Claude Van Damme, whose last name you still can't say out loud without muttering unintentional profanity), Bison's long-time nemesis, is determined to get them back. Guile makes a deal with two arrested smugglers, Ken Masters (Damian Chapa) and Ryu Hoshi (Byron Mann), to join the gang of Bison's main henchman, Victor Sagat (Wes Studi), to find Bison's hideout in exchange for their freedom and passports back home. The problem is, reporter and martial arts expert Chun Li Zang (Ming-Na Wen) is after Bison for murdering her father. Chun Li takes her film crew and fellow fighters, Balrog (Grand L. Bush) and Edmond Honda (Peter Tuiasosopo), to follow Ken and Ryu.At Bison's fortress, Chun Li, Balrog and Honda are captured while the homing device Ken and Ryu have lead Guile to the hideout. With the aid of Cammy (Kylie Minogue), T-Hawk (Gregg Rainwater) and his soldiers, Guile invades the fortress and helps his friends save the hostages, while taking down Bison and his forces.Well, except for Honda being a Hawaiian sumo, Balrog being a hero instead of one of Bison's evil henchmen, Zangief (Andrew Bryniarski) being a villain instead of a hero, Sagat not being a 7 foot tall tough fighter like the game, and other various changes, the actors do mostly resemble the video game characters and their looks. The movie actually improves on Ryu and Ken by making them more relatable. In the game, Ken is a wealthy, vicious and arrogant fighter, while Ryu has forsaken everything else in his life to perfect his fighting skills. In the movie, Ryu and Ken are the buddy team you see in every action film, but here it works. The two steal from criminals by selling them weapons that turn out to be bogus. Ryu is a straight-man with a conscience and will to help others without thought of profit, while Ken wants to be rich and has a wondering eye for good-looking single ladies.The cast works well, particularly Minogue as Cammy, Van-Damme as Guile, Jay Tavare as Sagat's helper Vega, Wen as Chun Li, Studi as Sagat, Chapa as Ken, Mann as Ryu and, best of all, Julia as Bison. Bryniarski also does great as the not-so-smart, yet good hearted henchman Zangief who turns good by the end and he has the best laugh-out-loud moments (like when he realizes Dee Jay works for the evil Bison because of the paycheck, Zangief asks, ""You got paid?"").The action works well and the fight scenes work well, especially Ken VS. Sagat, Ryu VS. Vega and Bison VS. Guile. But curiously, most don't have many memorable fights except with guards (like Balrog and Cammy), which is a shame, since so many opportunities for fights don't happen in the film. For example, Chun Li has a brief fight and awesome fight with Bison, but she doesn't fight any other villains except for Bison guards. Others, like Dhalsim, don't fight at all. And while it's nice to try and have an origin for Blanka, he's not as feral or muscular (or cool) as he is in the game, nor does he have any memorable fights, except in quick glimpses with - you guessed it, Bison guards.Also, none of the characters have any special powers like in the game. It's a shame things like Ryu's fireball (which only happens in a brief flash of light in the fight against Vega), Ken's flaming fist when he uses his Dragon Punch move and Dhalsim's fire breath are all absent.If you watch after the end credits, the film has an ending that sets up for a sequel (which, right now, is reportedly in the works). No matter what the public (or Street Fighter fans) think, I actually liked this film. It has good action, nice humor and good characterization. Is it disappointing? Sure. But is it good nonetheless? Of course.",Street Fighter
171,ggarmatr,"25 years, still disappointed",3,31 October 2019,"So, okay. We're still a few months from its actual silver anniversary. But I think it will be more like ""charcoal"" anniversary.
When I went to the movies to watch this with my friends during its cinematic release, I was excited for a number of things: (1) van Damme was quite a hit in my country; (2) I had started playing and enjoying the game upon which this movie was based; (3) My preferred character when I played was Guile, played by van Damme in the movie; (4) our literature teacher just made us ""The Joy Luck Club"" so by this time I had a crush on Ming-Na Wen--i didn't really who Kylie Minogue was; and (5) Raul Julia, whose performance as Gomez Addams was something I really enjoyed.
At that time, I probably would have rated this an 8. When we watched this again during college years, I'd have rated it a 6 (we still had fun playing the game). A few more viewings in the next few years and it's become an even more blah movie. A throwback gaming event made me borrow my friend's DVD collection of Street Fighter movies.
Oh boy. It's gotten worse. We can chalk it up to that adage about becoming wiser as you grow older, but the movie just didn't take me to that excitement when we watched it in the movies.
Sure, it's not the worst movie ever. But, franchise-wise? Very good chance that it is.",Street Fighter

It's mystifying how quality actors such as Raoul Julia and Ming Na Wen got involved with this sad mess.

173,hannesjungbeck,A very American pile of garbage,4,21 November 2019,"Street Fighter (1994) has very few things going for it. They actually featured a lot of characters from the games, something that game to movie adaptations for some reason get wrong a lot of the time. The casting is pretty spot on apart from T.Hawk who's from Sacramento or something, but that's pretty much it. The script is stereotypical and blasé and follows a well known linear format but with enough romance, humor and slapstick action thrown in there. In true 90's action film style there's the soldiers in hockey gear who can't aim for their life, and the dramatic one-liners between the fighters are cringeworthy to say the least. The shots and framing are film school 101 and camera work is not very interesting.The acting ranges from OK to horrible but never, ever above. Van Damme is annoying and fake as well as Kylie Minogue, who's in this for some reason. During the fight at the end between Ryu and Sagat they kiiinda do some of the moves from the game, but no visuals or sound to really enhance the fact that it's a SF movie can be found.If you are indeed on the lookout for a cheesy, American, mainstream action movie with bad acting and ironically low quality dialogue you won't be disappointed by Street Fighter. But don't tell me this is a good movie by any stretch of the imagination. If the movie contains the line ""I need a vacation.""- you know it's bad.",Street Fighter

This movie was based on the popular video game of the time and I felt it was portrayed well, the characters were all in it and on whole it wasn't a bad film.  Ok, enough of the professionalism this movie starred Van Damme as Col Guile and it was a terrible performance, for starters it was Van Damme and he didn't need to be made more of a fool but that hair colour and the script he was given made The Order look like a masterpiece (if you are wondering why I didn't compare it to Replicant just watch it and you will see why).  Some of Van Dammes quotes were just plain awful, ""F*ck you...Bison"", ""you son of a bitch"", yeah sound good quotes for an action movie but listen to him say them and you will hear what I mean with that accent. It was very disappointing to see the character Blanka in this movie, he was like the anorexic incredible hulk, I detect it was just kylie manogue with her make-up on. As for Kylie Manogues acting in this movie, well lets just say Van Damme was an Oscar winner compared to her. I'm still not sure what the story was about, oh yeah, rescue hostages or something, there you go; there was a running plot behind this trash. I have seen worse (for legal reasons these movies will remain anonymous) but this movie was borderline Executive Decision (certain people know why I have chosen this movie), which makes it technically a classic in our books.

176,dead_pool09,"a lot of fun. cheesy? yes. but fun, and that's what it was going for. vastly underrated.",10,30 November 2009,"As a Street Fighter fan I decided to try and defend this underrated movie. I enjoyed the live-action movie back in 1994 and it carries my general perspective of Street Fighter.Many people complain about the movie straying from the game's plot, and all the characters were changed. This isn't necessarily true, the game's plot isn't that deep: you, as one of the Street Fighter characters, try to bust a drug lord and his minions. Even the game Is a little deeper than the Super Mario Bros. movie's plot (two plumbers trying to save the day), but try making a 90-minute movie out of it.Same for the movie's views of the characters. Most of them are close enough to the game's characters. The movie did portray Guile, Bison, Chun-Li, Sagat, Ken, Ryu, Cammy, Zangief and Vega correctly (Guile and Chun-Li both still have personal vendettas against Bison, Ken and Ryu have their rivalries with Sagat and Vega, etc). I had no problems with E. Honda, and Blanka and Dhalsim only briefly appear (I personally prefer the 'Charlie mutated into Blanka' story). The only characterization problem the movie had was that a few characters just weren't shown right. Steven E. DeSouza should've just re-cast the actor playing T. Hawk. Plus, Balrog and DeeJay swapped alignments, but that's all. Most of the World Warriors and Grand Master characters ARE correctly depicted, just the New Challengers (exception being Cammy) just needed better casting.",Street Fighter

Crappy fighting, crappy acting, an Oscar worthy plot and ensemble cast (ha ha) and Van Damme as Guile. What a joke. And if you thought that was hilarious, check out Gomez Addams himself as the sinister M. Bison. Then there is Blanka (played here by the Incredible Hulk...I think) who looks utterly laughable.

Van Damme is the star and he does not do a good job but the writing, concept and directing didn't help either.  Julia's last movie, one of his worst moves.  There was not enough commitment on the part of the entire movie to make it bad, yet entertaining.

The role of Bison is played to OTT perfection as it should be in my view by Raul Julia, and also Kylie ain't that bad either.

The best actor in the entire film is the late Raul Julia. He gives the popular video game character, M. Bison, human traits and a personality. It's sad this was Raul's last film, but he did his best to the last. There are other actors to admire. One is Wes Studi, who, as Sagat, has great chemistry with Raul Julia. Damian Chapa is really good as Ken. Byron Mann is perfect for the role of Ryu. Andrew Bryniarski is quite good as Sagat. Ming-Na Wen does well as Chun-Li, too. Grand L. Bush is also good as Balrog. The cast seems perfect, with two exceptions: Jean-Claude Van Damme and Kylie Minogue. Julia, Studi, Chapa and Bush make Van Damme and Kylie Minogue look like the leading couple of the ""Brady Bunch!"" The music, most notable in the scenes with Bison, is pretty good, too! Steven E. de Souza is an interesting director. This film beats other video game movies, including the RESIDENT EVIL films, the TOMB RAIDER flicks, SUPER MARIO BROS., DOOM, ALONE IN THE DARK, etc. This film was made possible with the contribution by Raul Julia.

189,commieluke,hey at least Raul Julia was good....,4,4 May 2003,"A lame film, yes. But how did it ever get into the bottom 100??I can't believe there are people out there who actually manage to hate this film. Ok the plot is weak, characterisation non-existent, and most of the acting ranges from poor to mediocre, but it has a number of small things going for it and one very big thing (hey don't get excited girls)The plot may be lame, but c'mon, you have to give it points for focusing on it rather then bogging down the run time with masses of pointless subplots. Hell even the obliquity romantic subplot is pushed so far into the background so as to be almost unnoticeable. It's not a laugh a minute, but some of the lines did strike me as funny. Yeah yeah I have a lame sense of humour, but it's not like I get to choose what I find funny.Neither of these two points are any reason at all to watch the film. There is in fact only one reason to do that. Raul Julia. Wow. If you're playing an insane megalomaniacal villain you have to go all the way or the whole thing falls down. Raul Julia goes all the way, then a little bit further. The screen positively lights up when ever he's on it, frankly the film is worth watching once just to see him in action. I would go as far as to say that Bison is now one my favourite film villains ever, and the only thing that stops this film from becoming utterly forgettable. Don't get me wrong, it's still a bad film, but Raul Julia's performance prevents me from hating it.I am surprised to see it so widely panned. C'mon, it's a street fighter movie, what did you expect?? You didn't go into this looking for an emotionally moving experience with numerous fine understated performances, and if you did you're a moron. It's action fluff, that's all it aims to be, and on that level the film is a success.I have no idea what to rate this film. On one hand it's a piece of crap, on the other I can't slam a movie that had such a great villain. Watch it, but keep your expectations low and you won't be (to) disappointed.Character by character line up (in no particular order).Bison - well I just went into how great I thought Raul Julia was in this film. A+Guile - huh?? Who cast Jean Claude Van Damme as an American soldier? Once you get past his accent though, he turns in a fair performance. Make no mistake though, that accent is very distracting for the most part. Weren't there any American action guys (with smaller salaries) available? C+Cammy - again with the casting. Why is Kylie Minogue playing a British solider when she's Australian? Granted the American audience won't notice, but it was bothering me for the whole film. Anyway a small part, and again a fair (if dull) performance despite the accent. CKen + Ryu - well their both fairly interchangeable (hey just like the game). They both look fairly good in a fight (or at least their body doubles do), and when their required to actually say something they do a fine (albeit bland) job. C+Zangief - the main source of the comic relief. Hey I liked this guy, and the accent actually fits! Wow! B+Dee-Jay - apparently he's the computer guy. Huh? So why's he called Dee-Jay? The name made much more sense in the game. A lot of his part consisted of having to look at Zangief when the Russian makes a stupid comment. Not very demanding, but he it done well. BE.Honda - this guy sucks. Only the Godzilla reference while fighting Zangief was funny. Otherwise he was just another good guy. Ho-hum. DBalrog - like E.Honda. only without the funny Godzilla bit. D-Vega - well he's not in it very much, just around for the fight scenes which make assessing his character difficult. Still, from what little we got he was good. CSegat - suffered from being the second villain to Bison. Hell anyone would have paled next to that, but the fact that you actually noticed Segat in comparison says a lot. C+Dhalism - yep, he's in it. He's the nice doctor bloke in case you where wondering. Utterly different from what he was like in the game, they really only made him the doctor because there was no other place for him. D+Blanka - green guy with a dumb wig. Sounds interesting? It isn't. Still, the wig was funny. D+T.Hawk - who? His name was only mentioned once in passing, he was one of the generic solider guys. Seriously, they could have cut him out and noone would notice. Hell I doubt anyone noticed him anyway. FChun Li - cute girl. Lame actor. But still.. She's cute, and her opening news broadcast was well done. She bought two irritating sidekicks with her though.

The movie wasn't well done to say the least. It sorta played off of that feel when Street Fighter II game was first released that Guile was the lead character. But the way that they had all of the characters set up was just an insult to the game. Ryu and Ken being street hustlers, Chun-Li being a news reporter, E. Honda and Balrog as her news crew, DeeJay as Bison's lacky, and Sagat being old and short. What really killed it was when the fight started with Ryu and Vega and he did that sorry-ass Hadou-ken which was nothing but a camera flash. The whole plot just screwed the movie up. The only things that the movie got right was Zangief and Vega. Zangief was a big, brainless brute who indeed did work for Bison. The guy they had to play Vega fit his entire profile. He was a pretty boy and he had the fighting techniques from the game down somewhat. The only difference with Vega was that he didn't have any dialogue and he didn't get all hysterical when he burned his face. It just really puzzles me to know if CAPCOM had any say in the making of this movie at all.",Street Fighter
191,waltos_1999,"Should have been better, but wasn't",2,26 March 2001,"It seems that there was a trend to movies based on video games. Before the first Mortal Kombat came out, no film could quite get that enjoyment level. Super Mario Bros. and Double Dragon turned out to be huge flops, and sadly, so has this movie. All three basically have the same problem in common - the plot of the movies has little to do with the video game, which may turn off most viewers familiar with each series.Granted, I was expecting Street Fighter to be a high-impact movie laden with special effects and spectacular fight scenes, but this film delivered on neither. The only convincing fight scene was the showdown between Guile and M. Bison (and even THEN, I wasn't convinced).There were lots of inaccuracies in this film (that only hardened Street Fighter purists might notice) - for instance, Dhalsim as M. Bison's evil doctor, E. Honda's character being played by a Samoan, Balrog holding a gun (with his boxing gloves still on, no less!). And whoever did the casting for this film should have been fired immediately after the film was completed! OK, OK, so maybe there were a few casting accuracies (Ming-Na Wen as Chun-Li, and Raul Julia (God bless his soul) as the sinister M. Bison), but there were a few BIG misses (Jean-Claude Van Damme as Guile, and Peter Tuiasosopo as E. Honda --- they don't really fit their characters) that couldn't be overlooked.I can't say that this is the WORST video game-themed movie ever made, but I'd give it a 4, because it did manage to retain some of the game's hotness. I'd rather watch Mortal Kombat over this one, though.",Street Fighter
192,Red_Scarf,The reason why movies made from video-games have a poor reputation.,2,25 July 2000,"Flicks based on video games don't get as bad as this one.  Ok, maybe thats not true- Double Dragon was even worse.  But lets face it, when you go to watch a movie, there are plenty of elements that you would look for in a motion picture.  It's either good acting, great direction, perhaps an involving plot, explosive action, or possibly humor.  Street Fighter possesses absolutely none of these elements.  Hence it totally fails in all catagories.  Overall, the casting was terrible, save a few minor characters and Raul Julia as Bison.  But I mean, the popular Ken and Ryu play limited roles (oh and their outfits are prison uniforms in the movie) and instead they substituted a Frenchman (JCVD) to play the heroic Guile as the main character.  How stupid.Not only that, but nearly all the characters in this movie are American (so much for the ""World Warrior"" gag).  And half of them don't really fight. Perhaps the biggest problem with Street Fighter was that they tried to put too much of the game into the movie (and they didn't do a good job of that either).  They tried to fit in too many characters, who mostly do nothing but let you know that they're in the movie.  But there is one very retarded part in the movie that tried too hard to capture the essense of the game: Bison remotely tries to kill Guile using a ""joy stick controller"" with a large camera display (just like in the arcade), while Guile is in a hovercraft.  Bison actually manouvers the joy stick in ways as if he's performing special tasks, just like a dragon-punch in the game (street figher fans know what I'm talking about!).  When I saw this part, I was laughing my ass off (at the movie, not with it).  After that, I knew that the rest of the movie would be pathetic too, which it was of course.4/10 for Street Fighter!",Street Fighter

194,roboncrak,A complete waste.,1,18 December 2001,"Whatever money, talent and time were invested in this movie was completely wasted. What were they thinking when they wrote this awful script? I'd rather not know. The less I think about it, the better it will be. If you are a fan of the Street Fighter gaming legacy, this movie will have the same effect as a slap to your face. Especially if you paid to see it since the characters used in this real life adaptation of the game are so unconnected to their original background from the game that I found it sickening. Chun Li a reporter? Balrog her camera man?! No, no NO! Even though it might have been difficult to write a decent script to follow SF's original storyline, the final product I saw was just unacceptable. Their casting decisions might be considered mediocre at best as well. Thank God that time where Hollywood had to cast a well-known figure as leading role has somewhat passed. Jean Claude is a sucky Guile if I've ever seen one. It might have been okay if he wanted to go pass Halloween of something... but he just doesn't look like Guile at all.To be really honest, this movie is mediocre even if you forget the fact it's an outrage to the original Street Fighter's essence. Some good performances on the acting part by Raul Julia. (Also his last film, poor man... to end his career on this type of flick... some say he might have died of shame.)If you're a fan of SF and just must see every movie ever made about it, this movie will rank very high in your worst movies of all times list. (In fact, it will surely be a reference for bad movies for the rest of your life.) If you're not - although you might enjoy it a tad more, don't waste your time on this movie and rent something else.",Street Fighter

And I can't see what the problem is with this film.Supposedly the problem was that it put more focus on comedy then martial arts, but both seemed rather well here.Many of the jokes put in seemed to get a giggle out of me such as Zangief's stupidity and Bison's lack of taking anything seriously. As for the martial arts, what is here is pretty good too such as tag team fight, a sumo wrestle and the main one with the Protagonist and the Antagonist. Another problem I suspect the film may of had was that not many of the characters were fleshed out enough, but I personally can forgive that since there isn't much room for all characters and it's nice to even see them put in here at all.The effects, while many outdated nowadays, are pretty passable and the sets were really well designed.I understand this film didn't do well for many but its one I can personally recommend if you have not seen it.",Street Fighter

197,krainov-artiom,"""If good men do nothing, that is evil enough""",10,14 April 2015,"The veteran of action movies, screenwriter Steven De Souza took as basis not the original game from 1987, he took its more popular sequel ""Street Fighter 2""(1991), which differed much more original design and interesting selection of fighters. But he wasn't trying to just make a fighting game, he decided to use the characters and ideas of the game as the components of sci-fi action thriller, which he invented. Steven is also a director, this film is his second director's work, after a long break on screen writing career.In the film there is a big semantic implication and teachings, in the form of dialogs and remarks between the characters. The picture is filled with deep meaning, but it does not become tedious or boring, on the contrary everything is very appropriate. The film is very spectacular, excellent stunt work and work of the artists and special effects creators.Despite PG-13 rating, the film does not seem quite childish, it has a lot of violence and murder, ever-present tension. For example, the movie begins with news from the hot spot and displaying of General Bison breaks the necks of the captive soldiers. The director came up with the fictional country Shadaloo in which General Bison is trying to seize power, while on his secret base, equipped with modern equipment and weapons, serve him a lot of fighters and scientists. His ultimate goal is to have the whole world. General wants to create an army of super soldiers, mutants. He takes as a donor of one of the captured soldier named Carlos Blanca - Charly, it is one of the interesting changes of the director, in the game mutant was another man, but his name is also Blanca, in the game Charlie is the name of the soldier who was killed Bison, and for whose death now wants revenge him on another soldier named Guile, Charlie's friend. Also for example, the girl-fighter Chun Li in the film is the leading reporter, reporting from Shadaloo, boxer Balrog is the cameraman, and sumo fighter Honda a television director, they both leave a career and now work in television together with Chun Li. A excellent interpretation.Street fighters, main characters of the original game Ken Masters and Ryu, now deal with different kinds of fraud, they arrive in Shadaloo to crank out another thing, but to cheat Sagat and his men they have not come out. Sagat decides to use them as gladiators. But during the first bout of Ryu with champion Vega, the building bursts Colonel Guile on the self-propelled gun, and arrest everyone. Now Guile wants with the help of Ken, Ryu and Sagat to find the lair of Bison and rescue the hostages. Parallel to this, Chun Li and her friends prepare his plan of salvation. This is very well thought out story. Like in the game, Ryu helps Ken, to make the right decisions.It should also be said that Steven was able to skillfully use the elements of fighting in the story with gun shooting, explosions and chases. In the film there are all super attacks and the habits of the characters, and the actors are strikingly similar. Best turned out Vega - very quick and plastic fighter in the mask and with a glove with blades, which brilliantly played the Jay Tavare, the character literally stepped off the screen of the arcade machine. The same can be said about Zangief, naive strong man, who, being a kind man, foolishly went to serve for Bison.Guile is well played by Jean-Claude Van Damme, in the film he has a short haircut, which in principle is right, because he's military. From Major, he became a Colonel, he perfectly fulfilled all the incredible techniques of this character from the game. But personally I very liked Damian Chapa in the role of Ken, he gave the character a more natural image, a kind of merry rascal. Well, and actually, this actor always liked me. General Bison is great played Raul Julia, this is perhaps his best role, the last role unfortunately, the actor died two months after the completion of filming, the film is dedicated to his memory. As always at Steven De Souza, a very competent humor, really funny in many scenes and dialogs. The film does not become too comedic. All perfectly balanced. He also wrote the title song and exciting radio-remarks. Great Graham Revell music, perfectly emphasizes the atmosphere and morale of the film. Especially managed opening theme, and the theme of sending of the AN(Allied Nations) soldiers.A movie that may many teach the younger generation, an example to follow. The perfect combination of action, sci-fi, fighting and humor. A great example of how to make movies based on video games. 10 out of 10.I strongly disagree with critics who threw slop this wonderful film. Guys, I think you do not understand what you want. Probably you wanted make the characters look cartoon and silly, like in the game. In any case, this is not a criticism, it's just your stupid taste. Need to be a very bad person to scold this film.",Street Fighter
198,Jennifer_Gardner,Laughing at most reviewers (Read before giving this movie a 1/10),10,22 November 2005,"This movie ranks as one of my favorite films I have ever seen. I have watched the film over 7 times over the past month and have still enjoyed the work. Reason? People keep viewing this film as a serious VidGame-to-film adaptation. It isn't. This film has a creative license, which has it's own storyline, with a few ""game"" ideas thrown in. This film isn't supposed to be a serious action flick. It's a light-hearted action spoof, which is meant to entertain.I disagree with 99% of all reviews i have read all around the internet, in which to say that this movie doesn't suck. People just can't see it for what it really is - a spoof, not unlike Hot-Shots (albeit, not so obvious).Raul Julia is the best, and from what i feel, the Bison I'd imagine to be. Mad, self-opinionated, and damn sure of himself. So sure that he can still joke.People need to stop viewing this film as a straight forward VidGame-to-film adaptation. This is a film, with Street Fighter characters and a couple of Street Fighter backgrounds. I could guarantee that if all the characters were given different names, people would be complaining that ""it was a street fighter ripoff"".Take my advice - give the film a go, and view it as a spoof. Something just to laugh at, and not taken seriously. Once you master that, you may begin to see why i love this film so much",Street Fighter

This is a video game into a movie, the adaptation is very well and it used the video games story line almost flawlessly it also filled in very tiny details that wasn't in the original storyline by the creators of the game (witch were then added to the game, **good communication between game and movie creators) so remember this movie was made for gamers 8-25, at the time it was made the Capcom Super Nintendo Street Fighter series was VERY popular, The casting was also very good in this movie, the only casting i found inaccurate was the part of carlos blanka after his mutation i personally thought a larger character should have been chosen seeing as though blanka in the game sits around lower ribs and is crouched down at that level so his standing height would be around 6'5,close to 300 pounds (after mutation) so before mutation the actor would need to be 6'5 200 pounds",Street Fighter

And I found it kind of funny. The story is all twisted if it gets compared with the video games story; I mean, in the video game, Ryu is the most important character and in the movie it is hardly seen. Cammy is a creation of Bison (in the video game), so she is part of the bad guys, while in the movie she is friend of Guile. A lot of intentional mistakes were made in order to transform what could be a good story into a useless-action-movie.I hoped to see hadoukens and spinning kicks when I first saw the movie, but there is nothing of that. In other words, the movie sucks.PS: Kylie Minogue, who played Cammy in the movie, declared later that she was completely sorry of shooting such a bad movie.",Street Fighter

I can see partially where people would complain about it, but for the most part it is a movie that any gamer or one well-acquainted with the series will enjoy. Non-gamers may enjoy it as well. It has plenty of action. This movie is pre-special effects. This is what makes it so powerful yet so simple at the same time. It doesn't rely on effects--it relies on the storyline alone. For adults who were growing up back then, this is a serious trip down memory lane. You have to stop and ask--""where were you when the Street Fighter movie came out?"" I suppose as hardcore gamers and fans, nit-picking is in our system. We expect video game movies to be right on the dot of the storyline within the game. We are disappointed when these expectations are not delivered. A good movie about a fabulous game really doesn't have to do so. Street Fighter proves this by taking elements of each character's story from the game and putting in on screen. It is a classic in its own right.",Street Fighter

This one is near the top of my list and like to explain why.First of all, in all so-bad-they're-good movies the villain is just pure hate and villainy. (check, the main baddie being a disapproved over-the-top version of Darth Vader) Second, all characters should look like they ran straight out of a comic book (obvious check, since the base of this movie is a computer game).Third, the army of baddies can't hit a thing with overpowered / modern weapons, when the hero has a small rifle (or a handgun) with he single-shots every baddie in the area. (check, and this movies makes that a double-check) Fourth, cliché's about women. The only are annoying and just screw up everything ( according to the cliché of course ;) ) (check, with one exception, a blonde girl does succeed in kicking some a**. Mr. Tarantino, have you been inspired by this?) Fifth, really dumb sidekicks (check. Only the bad guy has a dumb sidekick, but I take that as a check) Sixth, the plot is either very dumb or non-existent, with ""plot""-holes the size of Texas (check, it really makes no sense at all, although the ""drop in the middle of the action"" twist was nice for a change) Seventh, it has to be predictable. (Check, at the end, the main building collapses with Jean Claude trapped inside. The main cast all thinks JCVD died, one minute they cry a bit, and in the next minute he walks up to to them and says that he is alive. :/ ) Eighth, even with all mentioned and taken into account, it has to be entertaining to the point it's actually re-watchable. (CHECK!!!, this one is really hilarious. The absolute rock-hard bottom in the movie is when the two heavyweights fought and it looked like they actually fell through the stage, I LOL'd very loud and thought I died, chocking in my laughter.)Wow, that's a 8 out of 8.

Van Damme was not believable and the script was poor. The only thing that saves this movie from being a disaster is Julia's performance. Kylie Minogue was a pleasant presence in the movie.

It reminded me of the times when the cast of saved by the bell were all involved with the basketball team, or the debate team, or working at the beach club, or in a band together. So much of the character has to change to shoe horn them into the movie. Ryu and Ken as Arms dealers? Chun Li, E. Honda and Balrog as a news crew? Come on.The even larger issue, however, is the lazy writing by the guy who wrote Die Hard, 48 Hours, Commando and so many other fun movies. This effort seems that of a first timer who had seen a couple of 80's action films and figured ""how hard can it be?""I honestly enjoyed Raul Julia's over-the-top portrayal of M. Bison, the only issue being that it deprived us of a real fight scene at the end of the movie (Same issue that Attack of the Clones had in an Annakin vs. Dooku showdown). Julia was in no position to provide anything but cartoon action. The choice of JCVD as Guile is... fine. He was the hot action commodity at the time. I get it. He isn't American. Stop putting him in movies and telling us he is American. Make something up! He was in the A.N. He could be from France, Belgium or wherever and you can just accept the detail change. I feel like Ming Na's performance was encouraged to be a little stereotypical, which is unfortunate. Sure, Bison can get her in the outfit in the end, but just some of the actions and tells were a little too much like an old Bruce Lee Movie, without the benefit of Bruce Lee. The bottom line... you can have fun watching this movie if you know what it is, but in no way shape or form is it a good movie. Poorly conceived. Poorly executed.

Plain characters, horrible story, horrible Bison (Sorry, Raúl Julia. You didn't deserve this part). Horrible main character (Van Damme stinks as a Guile, and Guile is not even the main Street Fighter character). Stinks at all!

220,KylieLover,Hmmm... Does my nickname tells you something?,2,27 September 2005,"I remember watching this movie when I was bout 10, big fan of the video game and didn't even know who Kylie Minogue was. I've always hated Jean-Claude Van Damme, except for his butt. Who ever told him he was an actor, must be hanging in some plaza and its balls should be selling as costume earring. He's always hideous, and this film isn't an exception.Know, Raul Julia, a Latin pride. Did he die because of insanity? Only someone as not well coordinated of his faculty would choose a movie like this and play a character like that. After this movie, I've become European. The movie used to fascinate, that's why I give it 2 stars. But know I find it pointless, and don't let me start with the VG that inspired this piece of crap.And know to the matter that brings me here... Ms Minogue. She's my idol, but I can't stop thinking how come she's always involve in such terrible movies (I've heard good comments bout The Delincuents tho). She's part of the stage here. She's doin nothing. Tis a shame cos I've always adored female characters on video game.Besides that, cute ending.",Street Fighter
221,hancocka,"I perform the ""Shun Goku Satsu"" on this movie",1,29 December 2004,"Shortly after the beginning of the disastrous Street Fighter movie, we see the words ""Based on the Capcom game Street Fighter"" displayed. How ironic, then, that the movie following is anything but. For a movie that purports to be based on one of the most well-known arcade games of all time, the Street Fighter movie does not so much tell the story of the game as it does rape, butcher, and mangle it into an unrecognizable form. The Mortal Kombat adaptation, while certainly not being a cinematic masterpiece, at least stayed relatively faithful to the games.Somewhere along the line in this parade of broken lives and shattered dreams, someone decided that the tournament-based, Enter the Dragon-like storyline of the game would never fly with the American movie-going public. And so it was rewritten, becoming a typical American action flick, with plenty of huge explosions, loud gunfights, and thinly veiled right-wing propaganda. A Japanese protagonist? That will never do. Why not cast the Belgian Jean Claude Van Damme as the American Guile, and have him become the main character? It's not as if fans of the game are going to mind, are they?Street Fighter the movie is a catastrophe. Every character, bar none, from the games is butchered and rewritten beyond recognition. Chun Li, played perhaps the only well-casted actor in this dreck, Ming Na Wen, has become a mere reporter (with a smirking Balrog and a Hawaiian shirted E. Honda as her camera crew, natch) instead of a detective, Ryu and Ken are incompetent gun smugglers, and Jimmy/Blanka and Charles/Nash become the same person in one of the most laughably absurd plot contrivances ever thought up. There are so many incongruities between this movie and the game that it becomes difficult to tell if they are merely the result of the incompetence of the writers, or their actual intent. For example, were the writers (whom I hope are begging for change at bus stop right about now) aware that ""Shadaloo"" was merely the name of M. Bison's organization, and not the name of a fictitious South Asian country? (which conveniently rests atop present-day Myanmar?) Or were they simply not paying close enough attention to the game's storyline? Who knows?Consider the most egregious example of the screenwriters' disdain for the source material: M. Bison walks into his laboratory and addresses one of the scientists there as ""Doctor Dhalsim."" Was Dhalsim a doctor in the game? Do we ever see him fight in this movie? Do we ever see him using his remarkably elastic limbs? The answer to all these questions, of course, is no. The writer's simply drop in a character named ""Dhalsim"" just for the sake of saying they included him. The movie's failing is in its desperation to include every single character to the detriment of the rest of the film. I can only imagine what Akuma would have looked like had the writers decided to include him.Anyone who played through Street Fighter knows that each character had at least one defining personality trait. Ryu was the stoic martial artist seeking to become a true warrior, his friend Ken was brash and arrogant, Vega was obsessed with beauty, Sagat wanted revenge on Ryu for scarring his chest, etc. It should come as no surprise that none of these traits appear in any shape, form or fashion in this movie, and in the rare moment that a character DOES act like their game counterpart, it's more often the result some sort of lame contrivance than a scripted personality trait. Chun Li's cameraman Balrog only happens to box. When Ryu and Ken and ""inducted"" into M. Bison's army, the uniforms they wear just happen to resemble the white and red karate gis they wore in the game. To top it all off, M. Bison gives a lengthy explanation of how his ""magnetic levitation"" that allows him to perform the movie's equivalent of the Psycho Crusher. It's as if the screenwriters set out to make a completely different movie, and were only told halfway through that it was supposed to be a Street Fighter movie.Which brings me to my next point; there's little actual ""street fighting"", giving fans of the games precious little to chew on through the movie's running length. Whatever fight scenes we get are brief and unexciting, and are nothing next to other martial arts movies. Instead we get Jean Claude Van Damme running from scene to scene, spewing out pithy one-liner after one-liner, gleefully trampling any remaining source material that hasn't already been butchered. Only Raul Julia and Ming Na Wen come through with any dignity left; they apparently realized what a turkey this film was and at least tried to have some fun with their roles. Their noble efforts, however, are sunk by the awful screenplay, which should be an example to future filmmakers of how NOT to adapt a video game to the big screen.As an aside note, there was actually an arcade game made of this movie. Yes, it was terrible, too.",Street Fighter

223,yama-2,Best Part of the DVD was the Interactive Menus.,1,27 February 2005,"OK right from the start I'm watching the popgun scene and immediately thinking ""Jackie Chan"" and ""Chris Tucker"". A stupid scene that was contrived to introduce the Ryu and Ken characters. Now in every other media that I have seen regarding Street Fighter (the game, the anime, the comics) these characters are rather complicated and are normally handled with care. They really don't come off correctly as ""goofballs"". So I hated this interpretation of them. Van Damme was COMPLETELY miscast as Guile. With his accent there was no way he could have pulled it off. Guile's character is supposed to be the gung-ho all American G.I. Joe type. He doesn't even look like the video game character. They could have at least given him the big brush cut and the green fatigues. Sagat looked like an old man. Again...to the casting director...have you even looked at the video game character? He's freakin' huge. He's virtually all muscle. How can you miss things like that? Mr. Julia didn't fair much better, although I like him as an actor he just could not pull this off. Bison is a TOTAL psychopath, Julia gave it his best shot but really fell short. He doesn't particularly fill out the uniform either. The action was also too slow to do justice to the characters. Perhaps they should have thought about enhancing the speed. As for the other characters, I think there were just too many to build upon. I found it familiar to Mortal Kombat Annhilation where they were introducing SO many characters that it was hard to keep them straight. In summation, I didn't really care for ANY of the characters but Vega and Zangief were probably the best cast even though they were still misused.Now as for the plot, I still really don't know what the plot was aside from Bison taking over the world. Bison was dressed up as Hugh Heffner in one scene...maybe that was the plot...hard to tell.Things that stuck out: 1. Most of the extras were wearing red uniforms...how convenient 2. ""The pilot...would have to be...out of his mind..."". Come on, I'm no actor and I can deliver the line better than this. 3. Bat boat...""stealth mode detected""...hmmm not very stealthy 4. ""This is the collection agency...your ass is six months overdue"". Ouch...good line Van Damme...who wrote this little gem? 5. Took Chun Li 20 years to get this far? Wow, that is one long case. I probably would have given up after 5. And she's been allowed to expense things for that long? Must be a government job. 6. DNA mutagens? Anabolic Plasma? Sounds like good watching. 7. Prison escape? Classic. Always needed in a movie with weak characters and story and everything else. 8. ""They will talk...or they will...die"". 9. Incredible Hulk Paint...where do I get this?",Street Fighter

225,ratbooger2000,Not as bad as you think,10,11 October 2005,"Since this is an old movie I'll try and keep this relatively short. Everyone has already said how and why this is a bad movie and everything they say is a legit reason to hate this movie. However, I actually want to give this movie a positive review. Looking beyond the inaccuracies to what is considered canon in the Capcom storyline (which is probably the main complaint), this movie is just fun to watch. Lots of great dialogue exchange, some pretty nice action sequences, and excellent campy comedy. That doesn't mean it's a good movie though. The story overall is only average at best and there were a lot of noticeable editing mistakes (or just lazy editors). However, I still find this an entertaining movie to watch. The best way to enjoy this movie is to take it for what it is: action comedy.Pros: +Actors look close to their video game counterparts +Good overall action +One of the most quotable movies +Simply hilariousCons: -It is at best an average movie -Bad editing -You still might be mad because it's not accurate to the game",Street Fighter
226,rayshu,A solid guilty pleasure for me at least.....,6,11 November 2015,"This movie sure has a lot of faults in trying to base itself off a video game. First of all, many of the characters were either miscast or shallow. However I'm gonna start off by saying that Raul Julia has changed the way we view M.Bison in the franchise. He glorifies the persona as a simple dictator bent on taking over the world. A few other characters such as Zangief and Chun-Li also kind of helped me enjoy the movie a bit better. It might be because they were the closest in having resemblance to their game counterparts.Other than that, it's pretty funny casting or interpretations of everyone else. JCVD as Guile? LOL..... Kylie Minogue as Cammy, uh.... I guess she looks the part and this extends to stuff like E.Honda being Hawaiian to Ryu and Ken being con men. So practically the movie tried to change much of the law for the shake of making a movie. It's pretty messy or as I like to say...Cheesy.The movie is pretty goofy.... The effects are pretty over the top and same goes for the fight choreography. I mean look at the fight Ryu and Vega have... The dialogue also does belong in this category too but it's pretty laughably entertaining. Alright let's talk about the story.....Well, other than the fact M.Bison wants control. Let's see what the protagonists are up to. They just need to stop him. I mean there should have been more depth for us to care about Guile or Chun-Li's reason to hate Bison. It might have been a better idea to make Charlie a deceased dude rather than integrate the name into Blanka. That's just me, but I don't think adding the name 'Charlie' means a whole lot since later games in the franchise introduce the actual character. Chun-Li on the other hand needs a more fleshed out insight into her story, that's all I want from her. Ryu and Ken who are naturally the poster children of the franchise are nothing more than two goofy side characters who go about switching alliances. They're pretty bland. To wrap this movie up, the movie is sure not a good adaptation of a video game but the movie is a good time if I want to have a bit of roast.",Street Fighter

All the characters have kept to the game and it is obvious that the producers or whoever spent a lot of time adding detail and effort to the characters personalities, clothes etc. However it is obviously a hard job scripting the film due to all the characters backgrounds and so it often seems a little peculiar putting categorising certain characters but it's still good.The acting is mainly good however for some character there is little to see and the script is basic because, well so was the game. In a review i wrote that actor was cheesy however some actors wern't great but simply went by the script but the brilliant acting by Raul Julia was truly one to see as he plays a brilliant eccentric, You may know him form Addams Family. .They do give Van Damme and Kylie some poor lines but if u ever played the game u'd give this GREAT movie a 7/10 . They do,do great combat and their is often tension built so i say to not to slate this movie on it's random plot but to commend it's efforts and doing well to keep the game still going..The story goes that a mad man kidnapps loads and loads of important people for 20 billion dollars and it's cournal Guiles job to get them back .With combat, street fighting, romance and a good list of celebs it should appeal to most.Kylie Minouge = Cammy .

Not only does this film get the story of the games wrong(Chun-Li is NOT A DAMN NEWS REPORTER!!!), but the acting is hideous(particularly Jean-Claude Van Damme), the script is infernal(it makes Mighty Morphin Power Rangers: The Movie look like The Lord of the Rings), and the special effects leave much to be desired(some of the worst I've ever seen). Those looking for a good martial arts movie should stick with The Matrix, those looking for a good beat-em-up action flick should stick to Batman Begins, and those looking for a good video game-based movie should stick to...Street Fighter II: The Animated Movie.

A side of me agrees with the fans of the original Video-Game sub/storyline (Ryu being the Main Character and Ken basically being like a clone of Ryu... a Show off none the less, talented)... For a true fan of the Game, I would say that this Project was the greatest catastrophe to the street fighter franchise... Every fan of the game remembers this nightmare of a movie.But, Just as the movie itself... It's still entertaining. My mother really enjoyed it...

As someone who as a boy, was an avid collector of the figurines and a great fan of the game, this movie was a must-see. It's a simple story with a simple theme-good vs evil.Set in a parallel or future Earth, a war rages. General M. Bison (Raul Julia) is the megalomaniac who desires world domination but believes his purpose is just and noble. Colonel W. Guile (Jean-Claude Van Damme) is the UN Commander out to stop him. All fans of the game, look out for Ryu, Ken, Vega, Sagat, Zangief (a dumb follower of Bison), E. Honda, Balrog, Chun-Li (a reporter), Dhalsim (a doctor) and my favourite character, Blanka (who is a loyal friend of Guile). Featuring a cameo performance of Joe Bugner (an Aussie boxer) and starring Kylie Minogue (an Aussie singer), the movie leads to a final showdown between Bison and Guile.Entertaining, funny and always corny, Streetfighter is a lighthearted movie, in my opinion, solely aimed at the fans of the game, videos and figurines. As for those who have no background of the film, watch it but don't expect to see a meaningful film-it's an action vehicle for Van Damme and Julia (RIP).",Street Fighter

If you haven't played the games then just trust me those things listed above are staples of the Street Fighter games and should have been included, and *please* do not judge the games by this movie.

However I do feel bad about just saying negative things about this movie, so here is one positive note: Raul Julia makes the perfect M. Bison, if I were to remake the movie I would definitely recast him (In fact thats why I am giving it 2/10 instead of 1/10).

The gamepad was worth it, but the movie..well... free is still a little stiff.I give it two stars, and that's being generous. I admire the producers drive to want to make Street Fighter into a live action movie. I really do, but there were so many things wrong with that I don't know where to even start. Well first of all (a bit of repetition a head), everything was backwards. I can't even say backwards; they just stuck people in roles the producer wanted them. Ryu a hustler? Not hardly. And Vega hispanic instead of Spanish? Don't think so. They had a cast full of notable actors, but 1.) many of them were not suited for the role (first thought that comes to mind is Wes Studi -most notable for playing Geronimo- playing Sagat), and/or 2.) their true talent was suppressed (such as Ming-Na who played Chun Li). The producers should have really thought about this one before they made it.

Here we have a screenplay that was clearly written out of Steven E. de Souza's love for America and being American and killing things that aren't American, so the first thing we do (just like in every Schwarzenegger flick) is take a man who can barely speak English, or at least well enough to seem anything but miscellaneously European, slap an American flag tattoo on him and hope that Deaf people love movies based on Japanese Video Games from the 80s. In all this film is that generic 80s bad where you can still watch it. Some guys like Kylie Minogue, I guess. But going back to my first point, the only reason to watch this film is reassure yourself of your masculinity whilst at the same time releasing effeminate ""Awws"" for the genuinely adorable way one of the franchises biggest, sweatiest and most Russian-est guys is shown as a lovable mentally challenged bear-man.",Street Fighter

The movie certainly is not up to the other kinds of work you saw from Mr. Julia.The performance is wooden and seems to be pieced together from what the director may have had on hand. that is, maybe Julia did not even finish his scenes before his death.

242,starbane,Best Movie of Our Time,10,12 August 2005,"I am horrified to see the low reviews that many were giving this movie. My analysis? The movie is too smart for the reviewers.If Street Fighter was simply a serious action movie, than it would be lacking on several levels. However, Street Fighter is not a serious action movie. In fact, the movie is a parody of every action movie, and ultimately a parody of itself.Imagine being a writer and being told to write a script bringing together such random characters as the Russian Zangief, the Brazillian monster Blanka, the Thai kickboxer Sagat, and all-American Guile. What would you do? It would be nearly possible to create a serious and realistic plot from this. So the clever writer, de Souza, didn't. He made fun of the randomness of the game by creating a story that was paper-thin and dialogue that made no sense but sounded like ""action talk"". The result was one of the funniest comedies of all-time.My evidence? Examine this line.Bison: Why do they call me a madman? All I want to do is create the perfect genetically engineered soldier.That line, delivered by the amazing Raul Julia, summarizes the perfection of this movie. It is a hilarious and fitting line.Above the obvious humor, there is also a level of subtlety that is very amusing. Some of the jokes are hard to catch unless you've seen the movie 184 times, like me. For example - the text on the boxes that the AN troops are loading reads ""Inflatable Assault Vehicle"". And during the prison break, Vega pulls out a ""prison claw"", made from sticks and twine. These moments are nothing but comical genius.The bottom line is that Street Fighter is a beautiful and perfect movie, one of the only ones that I have ever seen. The only problem is in the ignorant viewer, who can't appreciate humor at its best.",Street Fighter
243,garyfletcher-10536,"What im on tv, im on tv now.... Leave it",7,29 January 2018,"This is without doubt one of the best 'worst' movies of all time, or is the worst 'best' movie? Its a movie based on the video game Street Fighter, with John Claude Van Damme portraying Colonel William F. Guile. The majority of the films budget was spent of Van Damme, which is why the other cast members are little known actors, barring the odd one or two. 
Despite Van Damme's brilliant performance as Guile (yes he was good), in the video game Street Fighter Guile is actually American! So its a little strange seeing him in his US Military gear with a Belgium accent. The same goes for Kylie Minogue, who is supposed to be English, but at least she puts the accent on. Honda looks more Samoan than Japanese, and Sagat is about 5'9, whereas in the video game he is a giant of a man!
Despite these (minor) niggles, the film and its cast actually work, with the characters proving to be quite likable. The one character i wasn't keen on however was Ken Masters (Damien Chapa) who wasn't a very convincing Ken to the one i'm used to in the games, and he was actually quite annoying. After getting through the first few scenes and his chemistry with the brilliant Byron Mann, who plays perhaps the most iconic character in the games at least, Ryu. Byron is a very talented actor who has gone on to work on some great things, such as DC's Arrow. Ken was played very poorly in my opinion, and he was more goofy then bad-ass, which would of suited him better. Again, this is down to the low budget cast. Ming-Na Wen plays the hugely popular Chun-Li, probably the most famous female fighting video game character. She does a decent enough job, and pulls off her trademark moves from the games (like the fast kicks), and looks especially gorgeous in her battle dress. Her calibration with on screen characters Honda and Balrog was unusual to say the least, but it worked for the most part. 
They somehow managed to drag poor old Simon Callow into this film, albeit briefly for some comedic scenes with Van Damme. I feel he brings the credentials of any film up with his presence alone, however long the duration. 
I can't talk about this film without mentioning the brilliant Raul Julia however, and his extraordinary performance. This was to be his final appearance in film, as he sadly passed away shortly after the films release. I do feel that the success of this film is largely down his portrayal of M. Bison, and boy did he nail it. Raul is absolutely amazing in Street Fighter, and without question the best actor in the film. Van Damme may have been the star and the highest paid, but Raul Julia steals the show with his performance.
Getting down to the film itself, it is without question a cheese-fest from start to finish, and everything a 90's action movie should be. So many films from this era followed the same pattern, bad guy takes hostages and has a list of demands, and hero saves the day, but it nearly always worked, at least in terms of entertainment. 
If you've never played the video games, you will still like this film, as its pretty self explanatory and easy to follow. If you do like the games, you will easily recognize the characters and their trademark moves which are taken straight from the games. 
Give the film a chance, it may surprise you, and its worth watching for Raul Julia alone, and his screen time with Van Damme is priceless. My only gripe is that they could of done more with the plot, and introduced a few more characters, but that aside the film is actually fun, just don't take it too serious.",Street Fighter

246,briandsutton-13337,A big disappointment,2,9 March 2021,I don't like this movie because they split into two teams and had a ridiculous story that didn't fit the legendary video game. All they had to do was make a movie similar to bloodsport in that they were all individuals fighting for themselves. That and it was very poorly cast. When you're a huge fan of something and anticipate a movie coming out to show the thing you love on film and you get a ridiculous joke it's a big let down. Mortal Kombat did a much better job than this although it had it flaws too it was a least cast well and captured the tone of the game.,Street Fighter
247,DMole,"Terrible, Terrible Movie",1,2 July 1999,"This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. Anyone who liked this movie is completely ignorant. It's pathetic when the video game has a better story than the movie based off of it. This is a horrendous movie. Jean Claude Van Damme in his worse role ever (you thought some of the others were bad). I'm sorry, but I didn't buy him as an AMERICAN soldier. Raul Julia shouldn't have take this role. When his character says, ""You thought you were fighting Bison the human when you were fighting Bison the God,"" you can't stop from laughing. The dialouge is absolutely rediculous. It's funny when it's not meant to be. And, the special effects are terrible, as well. Such as when Bison flys. It's so fake.I am a fan of the video game, but I hated the movie.",Street Fighter
248,jho_o8,not worth the street fight,3,23 September 2006,"This movie does not even lead up to the game. The plot isn't good at all. Terrible acting performances by most of the actors/actresses. I was surprise to know that Kylie Mingoue was Cammy. The fight scenes were fake. My favorites in the game were Ken and Ryu, and they made them unreal. Stick to the game other than the movie. The movie probably made more the movie. And for the rest of the other fighters, their background stories are also fake and very hard to believe. Basically, the whole movie from start to end was very boring. In my own opinion...they SHOULD MAKE A REMAKE OF STREET FIGHTER!!!! SAVE UR MONEY!!!",Street Fighter
249,hchamaa1,just scraped a pass,5,8 October 2006,"First of all, i hope that my comments do not offend anybody, they are clearly stated in terms of the Movie and that is all. I am a huge street fighter fan and am disappointed with the movie. The plot was fine, however, the characters were ridiculous! T-hawk, one of the largest characters of the classic, was so tiny it was a joke. Edmund Honda, who, as i understand, is Japanese, the movie portrayed him as being Hawaiian. And Guile...supposedly 100% American, was played by the muscles from Brussels. (no offence to Van-Damn). This movie ruined the classic street fighter image, and if it weren't for my favoritism of street fighter, i probably would've voted a 4.",Street Fighter
250,forense,They killed the game.,1,24 April 2002,"This movie is really a great waste of film, time, art, ideas and anything you can think about a movie. To begin, what did they have in mind when they did the cast? The only one who looks like the game's character is actually Raul Julia (I'm sorry for this being his last movie). And I only mean his face. Van Damme may be a good martial artist but he doesn't look like Guile anyway. And now, he's NOT the main character in the games, the comics, the animated series, nowhere. Why here? Because it was an american release? C'mon! If you take a look at the game you'll see Sagat is about 7 feet. And in this movies Ken is taller than him! Where was Tong Po? Now, Balrog is an spanish ""handsome"" bullfighter who never takes off his mask to protect his face, but in this movie we see his face the whole time and he looks like a mexican. Zangief is a powerful russian wrestler and in this movie is powerful russian idiot. Why? Because he's russian? If they didn't know, Vega has psycho-powers, not magnetic powers, and the movie version of the psycho crusher almost revealed the strings used to make Julia fly. The movie has nothing to do with the real storyline of the game, and the FX looks like any episode of the Saban's series (Power Rangers). And they had face to make a Mortal-Kombat-style game of this. In three words: Don't watch it!",Street Fighter
251,saiki-anmei,It's Okay,6,29 July 2007,"I watched this movie on one of the movie channels because I didn't really have much else to do, and it caught my interest since I have seen the anime before. It was different from what I expected, and things like the mispronunciation of Ryu's name bugged me (and by that, I mean I was tempted to yell at the TV since mispronunciation has always bugged me). The characters were written differently from what I knew, and that irked me. I'm used to Chun Li working at a hotel in Hong Kong, not as a journalist trying to defeat Bison, same with Cammy being a lieutenant for the AN rather than an assassin. Also, having Jean Claude van Damme play Guile was rather funny, especially since he speaks with a European accent and in the movie Guile comes off to me as a hardcore patriotic American colonel for the AN with the American flag tattooed on one of his arms. (He tried though. At the end of the day, he tried.) The special effects also bothered me, like during the fight between Guile and Bison, and Bison had those electricity sparks around his chest; however, the movie is twelve years old, so I can't really expect them to be excellent. Bison's life support system underneath his clothes bothered me as well. I don't like god modding like that. In the end it was pretty enjoyable, but it's not one of the movies that I would watch five times over or until I get sick of it. I might possibly watch it again if I'm bored and I really don't have much else to do. It's one of those titles that supports the sentiment that Japan should handle its own franchises.",Street Fighter
252,MovieMan1983,why do people hate this movie?,10,1 April 2002,"Almost everyone i talk to hates this movie.  They think it is the worst movie ever made.  I would have to disagree.  I think the movie has some good parts and some not so good parts (like when Ryu, Byron Mann, tells Ken at the end ""i know you don't,"" in the deep voice)  I believe that Street Fighter is one of the best made from a video game movies out there.

258,pastortunde02,Not Faithful to the game,3,29 April 2011,The Street fighter movie is the worst film adaptation of any game i have seen so far.The movie was not really faithful to the game. the characters had their background stories changed. In the game; the major character was Ryu; but in the movie the story was centered around Guile; i believe much story could have come from Ryu's side and it would have made the movie very interesting. Chun Li was another character that was not well developed in the movie; she was depicted as a news reporter which was not the case in the game. the Chun Li character would have contributed to making the story worth watching; but unfortunately her character was reduced to nothing. there were no special moves in the movie; the only moves we saw in the movie were poorly executed i.e Ryu's hadoken move against Vega and Ken's shoyuken move against Sagat. the storyline was too campy; there could have been a better storyline on the side of either Ryu or Chun Li. compared with Mortal Kombat and Dead or Alive movie adaptations; this movie bombed.,Street Fighter
259,marcos-mercedesn,The worst movie I've ever seen,1,11 October 2014,"This is without a doubt the worst movie I've ever seen. Usually when a movie is so bad you just move on and stop watching, but been a fan of Street Fighter I had to watch this thing from the start to the finish (twice in my life).The story is completely different that the story in the video games or the story of the other animated movies, Ryu and Ken are secondary useless characters, this movie is a waist of time.They just tried to make another action movie for Van Damme which impersonated Guile and was the main character in this movie, just another waist of time.I cannot believe how bad this movie was, just horrible.",Street Fighter

It's pure garbage and it's just indefensible how this was even watchable as a kid. I'm disappointed in this movie, but even more so in myself for thinking this was a really cool movie.It tries, it really does, and I give it credit for this by adding an extra star, but more than 2 is really pushing it.",Street Fighter
261,SeedX,A list of things wrong in the movie,8,9 November 2005,"1. the character that plays ryu is Chinese, ryu is Japanese. 2. sagat is suppose to be at least 7 feet tall. 3. sagat is suppose to be thai, not played by a native American. 4. street fighter is suppose to focus on ryu and ken, not Guile and Bison. 5. Cammy is played by an Australian, cammy is British. 6. since when was dhalsim a scientist. 7. one minute dhalsim is in a scientist outfit, next thing u know he half naked with a shaved head. 8. Balrog is a good guy???? 9. Vega is played by a native American, Vega is Spanish 10.

262,Rockerman6781,This is terrible,2,20 December 2004,"I am a Street Fighter fan and I think this movie sucks. It doesn't make any sense The characters look nothing like the characters in the game. Except for my favorite, Vega thats the only good thing about this movie. The movie is even humorous at parts (Blanka) Major Bison looks so bad that I started to cry.The acting is nothing short of awful. The song at the end of the movie is pathetic. In all fairness it does make as a good martial arts movie.You can also see this as an alternative to Mortal Kombat. So I recommend this movie if you like to laugh, Vega is your favorite Street Fighter Character, or you like cheesy martial arts movies.So heed my warning next time you are looking through the discount section in the video store do not buy this even if it marked down to twenty five cents. Actually play the games. Cool someone read my review",Street Fighter
263,jason_too_hot,I'm a lover of the games...but this film.....,3,3 May 2006,"Overall, the film was pretty appalling, it's gotta be said. Firstly, the American hero doesn't even have an American accent. They try to cover this by tattooing an American flag on his arm. Secondly, Kylie as Cammy? What the hell were they thinking? Thirdly, Ryu was not the ripped main character, just a mere skinny sidekick of Guile who knew how to fight. Dee-Jay was hardly featured at all and wasn't Blanka meant to be from Brazil?? The only attempt of a proper move from the game was a pathetic attempt at a dragon punch from Ken- which was not only hesitant but lacked his feet leaving the floor. I did think though that Chun-Li and Honda played good parts but the rest....was just awful. Sorry street fighter lovers!",Street Fighter

This is what happened when they were thinking about this movie. note:The boss is John and all of the other people are Bob John:Now everyone to make this movie complete i need everyone to gather all the information about ""Street Fighter"" (Moments later) John:Now everyone did you get and study everything about street fighter Bob:Of course we did so now we can make a great street fighter movie John:exactly now i need all of you to throw everything out and keep only the bare minimum of street fighter Just from that little story you can get the gist of how this movie was made i would say more but i have other things to do at the moment so see all of you movie lovers later 1",Street Fighter
265,Bromhidrosis,Vastly Underrated,7,5 July 2005,"I really don't see why most everyone has a problem with this movie. The storyline is solid, and is, contrary to what most people believe, somewhat true to the story. Like it or not, Guile and Chun-Li are meant to be the main characters in SF2 and the movie reflects this. In the games, their endings are directly tied to Bison. Of the remaining 14 characters (obviously not counting Bison,) only one other is: Cammy's, and that's only because Bison tells her about her amnesia.As for the casting, it was very well done. The only problems I saw/heard are Van-Damme's French accent, Dhalsim's casting as a doctor, which WAS well done despite being unfaithful to the game, T. Hawk's lack of height (I think Rainwater is shorter than Van-Damme) and Chapa's short hair. Otherwise, everything else was spot-on, especially the casting for Bison. Raul Julia is the only person that I think could've done it. He's a fairly versatile actor AND he looks like Bison. A couple other characters were miscasted like Dhalsim, but the excellent acting made up for that.The combination of Charlie and Blanka was both acceptable and unacceptable. How? Street Fighter Alpha didn't come out until a year after this film did, but both Blanka's and Guile's endings disprove the combination. Getting back to the story, it was actually believable for not being based around a tournament like SF2 is. Being forced into a three day timetable by Bison's ransom demands made the movie seem all the more action-packed, to me at least. The scene between Bison and Chun-Li in Bison's quarters could've been cut out, though, except for the part where Bison was about to get his butt kicked by Chun-Li. The final battle between Bison and Guile was the most blatantly choreographed yet still exciting thing I had ever seen in a martial arts movie up to that point, other than the odd scene from a few Jackie Chan movies.The sound was pretty horrible. Generic rap somehow found its way into the movie in the cage fighting arena scene, and I swear I heard it again when I played the god-awful SF3: Third Strike. That one should've been permanently shelved. The orchestrated music that made it into the movie was nearly impossible to hear, although some of it was vaguely reminiscent of Guile's stage in SF2. The worst part was the lack of music from the game. A symphony orchestra doing all the music from the characters that made it into the movie (so no Fei-Long or Akuma) would've been great. So would have the Amiga CD32 version of Super Turbo if it was out or the arcade version of Super.Many of the characters signature moves are not present. I counted one Hadouken (to Vega in the Ryu+Ken vs. Vega+Sagat fight in Bison's quarters, very easy to miss as it's done at point-blank range,) a few flash kicks (minus the special effect,) and one Psycho Crusher (I think that's the name.) No Sonic Boom, no Shoryuken, no anything else.Overall, there are a few glaring issues (sound and lack of special moves mostly,) but it's still very enjoyable.7/10Recommended to: Martial arts fans Van-Damme fans Street Fighter fansNot Recommended to: Street Fighter fans who believe Ryu and Ken are supposed to be the main characters without realizing only three endings out of sixteen people (not counting Bison and including Akuma) are actually tied to Bison himself.",Street Fighter

Bison was some skinny geek.. Oh let me not mention DeJay.. What the hell!?! Some skinny bad-speaking Jamacian.. I wish I had more good things to say, but I don't.Cammie was not sexy at all, Blanka was ridiculous, ken and ryu were some skinny no skilled fighters.

Also, Kylie Minogue is in the movie, that's kind of strange. This site left out the BEST quote of the entire movie. Anyone who is familiar with Street Fighter the game will know that Sagat has an eye-patch. At one point in the movie, it is discovered that Ken and Ryu are spies for the AN (the good guys). They are spying on Sagat and M. Bison. When this is discovered, M. Bison turns to Sagat, covers one eye with his hand, and says ""I guess you didn't see that.""

268,intabernaquandosumus,Watch it for the nostalgia,4,20 December 2005,"I first saw ""Street Fighter"" in theaters with my older brother and a few of his friends, and, as a four year old, I was upset by the lack of hadokens, yoga fires, hundred hand slaps, and sonic booms. Now older and (slightly) more mature, I can point out some of these movie's flaws accurately. First off, the campy style, as funny as it may be, takes away from the gritty and dark attitude that video game of Street Fighter II conveyed. Too many one liners, and predictable reactions are present. POSSIBLE SPOILER ---When Bison tells orders Chun-Li be taken into his personal quarters, E Honda and Balrog struggle harder in the same cliché way most heroes do when a villain is taking a female member of the team---- Some of the choices for actors were also under par, like Van Damme being Guile. I understand he's a kick@$$ action hero, but the guy is not all American, which is what Guile was all about. The portrayal of Sagat was disappointing; he's supposed to be a terrifying 7 foot tall menace, not some weak looking failed businessman. Removing Fei Long altogether was understandable, but Blanka should've been more prominent, rather than some odd rehash of Charlie and the Brazillian beast. Making Dhalsim a doctor, with NO powers at all, does not do justice to the real Dhalsim. I liked this doctor, but I want to see Dhalsim! Some of the characters were okay though; Dee Jay made a surprisingly good villain, Bison was well chosen, and Zangief was hilarious, but that's about as good as it gets. This movie also lacked any special moves at all, I mean understand they were on a low budget, and it was nearly 12 years ago, but come on, you can have a corny movie with cool colors, a cool movie with no colors, but you can't have a corny movie with no colors and expect people to love it (colors means ha-do-kens by the way). The only move they tried to portray was Bison's psycho crusher, and that kind of failed. Although the game was amazing, this movie should only be watched if you're not expecting the glory of the game, and can take this crap lightly. I feel like a teacher who has failed a student...",Street Fighter

(Allied Nations) are their only hope.The action in the story is pretty good, and there are good fights. The plot is a bit cliché, and at times almost silly, but I can see this movie becoming a cult classic. Not because its-so-bad-its-good, but because its not a movie made to appeal to a wide audience.

270,storres128,102 minutes of torture,2,21 February 2007,"If you're not a fan of the Capcom video game it was based on, this movie will bore you to tears with it's pathetic plot and hilariously bad acting. If you are a fan, like me, then this movie will question your faith. Why would God allow this? Street Fighter is a fantastic video game series with many likable characters that have very different reasons to fight each other. The movie pits them in two simple groups: the good guys led by Guile (Jean-Claude Van Damme), and the bad guys led by M. Bison (Raúl Julia). It makes no sense to see a Japanese sumo wrestler in a Hawaiian shirt, a native American soldier with face paint and a feather on his head, a Chinese reporter (Ming-Na), a banned heavyweight boxer, a British special forces agent with a part-time singing career (Kylie Minogue), and two traveling karate bums all helping the U.N. fight the evil drug-dealing tyrant M. Bison, whose team is composed of a Spanish bullfighter, a Jamaican rapper, a semi-retarded Russian bear wrestler, a one-eyed kick-boxer from Thailand (Wes Studi) and a Brazilian green-skinned monster who hates happiness. I wish I was kidding.It's a shame this was one of the last films of the great actor Raúl Julia, who did what he could to play a madman bent on world domination. Vaya con Dios, Raúl.If you somehow make it to the end of the film, be sure to watch until after the credits roll to witness one of the biggest jokes in Hollywood history, topped only by the ending of ""Masters of the Universe"", which is quite possibly the worst movie of all time.

THere is a lot of goofiness, yes I rolled my eyes saying this is very stupid, and it was acted out pretty much, it seems the cast wanted to finish this movie fast and go to the beach to relax. The best past though is when Guile is faking is death at the morgue and surprise the journalist, I rated it a two over a one, because of Van Damme acting in it and the ladies was beautiful, besides that, it is the worst movies that I ever rented.
