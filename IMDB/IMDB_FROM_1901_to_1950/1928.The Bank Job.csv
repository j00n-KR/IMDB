0,Leofwine_draca,"Familiar, but a whole lot of fun",7,22 June 2012,"Okay, so heist movies are ten-a-penny at the moment, but that doesn't mean that a decent bank robbery flick that ticks all of the right boxes won't do the job. THE BANK JOB, a supposedly true '70s set story of scandal, corruption and one big score, proves that there's still life in the genre yet: this is a slick and efficient movie with style to spare.Tough-cookie-with-a-heart Jason Statham plays Terry Leather (what a name!), the owner of a small East End garage who assembles a team to tackle a bank robbery. Said robbery takes up much of the running time as we get involved with the meticulous planning and preparation, but of course you don't have to be a cinemaphile to know that there's going to be hell to pay afterwards.Things take a decidedly vicious turn with the involvement of a seedy strip club owner (David Suchet, playing against type and excellent with it), and from that point in it's every man for himself. Statham relishes the chance to do more than just hit people, even if he does just end up playing the same old tough-but-decent character he plays in every single movie.Saffron Burrows, looking exceptionally gorgeous, is a fine addition to the cast and indeed the acting is what this movie's all about. Stephen Campbell Moore and Daniel Mays also do well as gang members, and keep an eye out for Craig Fairbrass playing to type as a particularly nasty East End thug.The real stars, of course, are writing partners Dick Clement and Ian La Frenais, who have been doing this thing since the '60s and whose script is so witty, entertaining and well-rounded that it would have been impossible to get it wrong.",The Bank Job
1,SnoopyStyle,Jason Statham without the action,8,1 March 2014,"Terry Leather (Jason Statham) is a struggling petty criminal. Martine Love (Saffron Burrows) has a proposal to rob a bank breaking into the safety deposit boxes. Martine had been pinched for smuggling drugs, and the MI5 or MI6 is using her to get at a deposit box. They're after Michael X who is a black activist, drug smuggler and general disruptive element. The only problem is that he is blackmailing the government with embarrassing photos of a royal family member in the deposit box. Terry doesn't know about the photos. When the gang breaks into the boxes, they find other embarrassing photos of prominent politicians, incriminating ledgers of big criminals, and lots of loot. Now everybody is after them.I don't know how much if any of this is true. All I know is that it doesn't really matter for the movie. The actual robbery is fun. The aftermath is quite complicated. It doesn't go into the flashy realm of the Oceans movies. The only minor complaint is the ending that is a little too neat. Somebody got overtime neatly pulling all the loose threads to wrap up at the same time. It's really unnecessary. A messy ending could have worked better.",The Bank Job
2,claudio_carvalho,A Great Surprise,8,25 February 2012,"In 1971, the criminal Michael X (Peter De Jersey) blackmails the British government with compromising photos of members of the parliament practicing kinky sex with prostitutes. He keeps the photos in a safe deposit box in the Lloyds Bank in the Baker Street.The ambitious MI-5 Federal Agent Tim Everett (Richard Lintern) plots a bold plan to retrieve the pictures using a heist of the bank. He arrests the former model Martine Love (Saffron Burrows) in the airport trafficking drugs and offers security information to her to facilitate to rob of the bank.In return, he requests the content of the safe box no. 118 that belongs to Michael X.Martine goes to East London and meets her former lover, the car dealer Terry Leather (Jason Statham) that is married with two daughters but owes money to a dangerous loan shark, and tells him that the bank's alarm will be deactivated during a few days. Terry summons his friends and the team of amateurs succeeds in the heist. However, together with the money, the gang also steels the photos of Michael X; the book with the transactions with dirty cops of the Scotland Yard of the pornographer Lew Vogel (David Suchet); and photos of politicians in the Sonia Bern's brothel. Now different groups organize a manhunt to Terry and his friends with different objectives, where the stolen money is the less important. ""The Bank Job"" was the great surprise of this week, with a good story based on true events. I bought this Blu Ray a long time ago but my expectations were very low. However this film is one of the best movies of bank heist that I have ever seen. In the end, the thieves are the most charismatic characters among such corruptors and unethical people. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): ""Efeito Dominó"" (""Domino Effect"")",The Bank Job
3,classicsoncall,"""I know if this stuffs up, I'm in poo-poo land!""",8,25 May 2019,"""The Bank Job"" has all the earmarks of a Guy Ritchie flick but without his name attached. I'm thinking of pictures like ""Snatch"" and ""Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels"", in which there are multiple sets of characters vying for a particular outcome. The eccentric British dialog and eminently seedy characters add to the entertainment value, while the plot isn't as difficult to follow as a Ritchie film. I didn't know going in that the story was based on an event that occurred in London on September 11th, 1971, the infamous Baker Street Robbery in which the money and valuables stolen were never recovered. For historians, that 9/11 date seems rather coincidental and almost conspiratorial, though it occurred three decades before the World Trade Center disaster.For this viewer, Jason Statham was the only known commodity in the cast, and as always, well suited for this sort of caper. He heads up a small band of merry men who are set up for a safety deposit bank heist, though there is a hidden agenda at play that involves the indiscretions of British politicians. A sub-plot involving a Malcolm X styled revolutionary running a drug operation is also included, more of a distraction actually from the main story, but still serving the film's purpose in the end.Given the film's historical setting in 1971, I was reminded of the Scottish singer Donovan who came to prominence in the mid-Sixties in England and ultimately, America. He had this hit titled ""Mellow Yellow"", that in retrospect seems fitting to honor this film's female lead who portrays the character Martine Love. It's Martine who gets the whole caper going when she approaches Terry Leather (Statham) about the bank job. Had she been around when Donovan came out with his hit tune, you'd believe the line in the song - 'I'm just mad about Saffron' - was meant specifically for her.",The Bank Job
4,lee_eisenberg,the '60s meet the '70s,7,26 August 2008,"Prior to watching ""The Bank Job"", I had never heard of the Baker Street robbery. That made the movie even more of a treat. While the plot has former criminal Terry Leather (Jason Statham) gathering some friends to carry out a heist so that he can pay off a debt, I interpret something beyond that. The movie is set in 1971, and some of the content is a remainder of the 1960s. Not only does the soundtrack include ""Lola"" and ""In the Midnight Hour"", but Michael X is a true personification of the black power movement (there's also a ""Free Angela Davis"" poster in one scene). And of course, the whole scheme looks to me like a real swipe at England's power structure. However, as things progress, it seems that the idealism of the 1960s is giving way to the cynicism of the 1970s. To be certain, at the end, we learn about how England's government has classified Michael X's files until 2054.Then again, I may have tried too hard to interpret the movie. Whatever the overall gist is, I recommend the movie, partly to learn about the robbery, but also as a look at the change from the '60s to the '70s. Also starring Saffron Burrows.",The Bank Job
5,jboothmillard,The Bank Job,5,4 May 2011,"I might have heard the title somewhere recently, and I may have heard about the lead actor, and it was pretty obvious from the title what the plot would involve, so I watched, from director Roger Donaldson (Dante's Peak, The World's Fastest Indian). Based on a true story, London car dealer and artful dodger Terry Leather (Jason Statham) is having slow business so former model who has a thing for him Martine Love (Deep Blue Sea's Saffron Burrows) makes him an offer. There is a bank on Baker Street that will have its alarms turned off for a couple of weeks, and the plan is to tunnel underneath two buildings opposite to get into the vault and take what's inside. So a team is assembled to carry out the plan, including photographer Kevin Swain (Stephen Campbell Moore), occasional pornographic actor Dave Shilling (Plus One's Daniel Mays), posh conman 'Major' Guy Singer (Bridget Jones's James Faulkner) and mechanic Bambas (Alki David). Inside Guy's gentlemen's clothes shop two doors away the tunnelling begins, obviously there are complaints about the noise from the neighbours due to the loud underground drilling. There is a point while doing this however that the floor caves in while in the tunnel, and that is when they find an underground site full of skeletons, and this makes for an easier passage to the branch of Lloyds. They manage to tunnel into the bank vault while one of them keeps an eye on the street above for any police, and they find many safe deposit boxes full of jewels and cash, as well as one with incriminating photos of a royal having sex with various men. There is a point when it looks like they will be caught in the act by police, as they are using walkie talkies that are being listened to, but they manage to get away with it, and that is when they find out the truth about the robbery. Martine made them rob the bank so that they would bring out the safe deposit box with the photos, that a Trinadadian thug, a high-end bordello owner and pornographer are involved with, to trade for avoiding a prison sentence. Guy and Bambas escaped with their share of the bank vault loot, but they are murdered by unknown persons, and the most threatening person wanting the photos seems to be Soho gangster Lew Vogel (Poirot's David Suchet), who kills Dave and kidnaps friend Eddie Burton (Michael Jibson). In the end Vogel and his criminal cohorts are arrested, Martine says goodbye and the gang members go their separate ways, and Terry is seen with his wife and kids living carefree on a yacht in paradise, the end text says that parts of the robbery investigation still haven't been concluded. Also starring Keeley Hawes as Wendy Leather, Craig Fairbrass as Nick Barton, Colin Salmon as Hakim Jamal, Peter Bowles as Miles Urquart, Peter De Jersey as Michael X, Georgia Taylor as Ingrid Burton, Richard Lintern as Tim Everett, Hattie Morahan as Gale Benson, Rupert Frazer as Lord Drysdale, Gerard Horan as Detective Sergeant Roy Given and Sharon Maughan as Sonia Bern. Statham is less thuggish than usual which makes a difference, the supporting actors get their time too, especially Suchet who is quite sinister in moments, it is an easy to follow story, and if you like caper film then this is reasonable entertainment, alright heist thriller based on a true story. Worth watching!",The Bank Job
6,ccthemovieman-1,"Heist Films Are Usually Entertaining, And This Is No Exception",8,14 August 2008,"Jason Statham is well on his way to becoming typecast. It seems like he's in a ton of these kind of action films lately, although this movie is a bit more subdued and complicated than some of them. At least in this heist flick, there are several twists and turns and you have to stay alert to follow who is exactly on the up-and-up and who isn't, and Statham isn't punching out 10 people at once.This is another one of these modern-day films in which the crooks, the thieves, the bandits - whatever - are the ""good guys"" and the police and the government officials are the bad guys. This seems to be a big favorite of the anti-authority filmmakers world in the last 40 years whether it's in Hollywood or London. Regardless, it's a very entertaining film and Statham and company are fun to watch. That's also nothing new as the tough ""Transporter"" star has become a regular at playing these kind of nice guy/macho/thug roles.Statham plays ""Terry Leather,"" a man recruited by a former hottie/model girlfriend ""Martine Love,"" (Saffron Burrows) to rob a bank. Statham is a family man but desperate for money and, obviously, not very honest. Thousands of pounds/dollars is in it for the thieves but valuable compromising sex photos are the real goal of the people who want the bank depository drawers robbed. Those want to be grabbed before the owner uses them and ruins some high uppity-ups in British government. Several people wants photos for other reasons. This whole thing isn't simple; there are number of sub-plots along the way regarding who wants what in the bank and for what reasons. There is also a story involving a Malcolm X-wannabe kind of creep who is into extortion and murder. Actually, everyone is pretty much a creep in this film, just to varying degrees. They are all interesting, too, and several of the minor characters have a good sense of humor, too. In particular, I liked Daniel Mays as ""Dave Shilling."" Add some very tense robbery scenes, some sex early on, some double-crosses later and you have a very serious Keystone Cops type story where you're never quite sure what crazy thing is going to happen next.A fun two hours of diversion, supposedly based on a true-life account, but knowing filmmakers I suspect much of this is made up for dramatic purposes. That's okay, we just watch to be entertained, and this is entertaining.",The Bank Job
7,rmax304823,More Than They Bargained For.,7,15 January 2010,"We keep thinking of safe deposit boxes as places where people keep cash and other valuables, like jewelry, family heirlooms, and the like. And, of course people do keep money in safe places. I had an elderly friend who kept her spare cash in the freezer, ""in case the house burns down."" It was wrapped in aluminum foil and labeled ""St. John's Bread,"" in case a burglar got into the freezer. What's so weird about that? It makes perfect sense.It also makes sense that if you have illegal drugs or incriminating physical evidence that, for one reason or another you want neither destroyed nor made public, you'd keep THAT in a safe deposit box too.That's what the half dozen thieves in this ""based on a true story"" movie find out. The bunch of diverse robbers are pretty well organized under the leadership of Jason Statham. They rent an empty shop two doors away from a bank and plan to tunnel under the intervening Fast Chicken restaurant until they're under the vault, then melt their way upward into the sacerdotal sanctum itself, bust open all the boxes, and make off with all the loot.Their enterprise is discovered by accident and at the last minute they're forced to stuff everything they can into their canvas bags without examining the take. When they DO have a chance, they discover that all sorts of inculpating data have been caught in their net.Let's see. There are the records of drug and prostitute transactions between a phony Black Power advocate from Jamaica and a London porno producer. There is a book of payoffs to bent detectives on the police force. And there are curious pictures of some members of the royal family involved in certain escapades, including, it appears, Princess Margaret. People keep things besides money in safe deposit boxes. And when these various groups discover that their property is in the wrong hands, they're most anxious to get it back.The government agents operate smoothly. They brush the London police aside and take over the investigation. They're all dressed alike in impeccable dark suits and speak with polished accents, but they're entirely serious.Even more determined is the Porn King -- David Suchet in another sterling performance. He and the Jamaican whore monger are particularly vicious. They chop up a possible informant with machetes, they use welding equipment to remove an informant's foot, and they shoot truculent captives. The thieves and the police refer to this rich and powerful gang as ""villains,"" without sarcasm.The thieves themselves aren't entirely innocent or idle and they wangle things so that, in the end, all but one of them are released, while the coppers on the take and the villainous drug operation get busted.It's fast paced and credible, though I'm not sure how closely the story hews to historical fact. The credibility of one scene, however, is unimpeachable. With a horde of murderous goons hot on his trail, Stratham rushes home to his wife, who has just found out about her husband's part in the robbery, and thrusts his share of the loot into her hands, saying, ""If anything happens to me, use this to get away."" His wife replies that the papers say a woman was part of the gang. ""Did you SLEEP with her?"" Sratham hesitates, and his wife bursts into sobs and begins slapping him about the head and face because he may have been unfaithful. Never mind that they might both be dead in an hour. THAT scene, I believe.That doesn't really matter since this isn't intended to be a documentary film. It's supposed to be a gripping thriller, that's all, and it succeeds. It even has a moral. If you're going to hide your shameful secrets, the freezer is as good a place as a safe deposit box -- and cheaper.",The Bank Job
8,blanche-2,True elements and a certain amount of conjecture make this one intense movie,8,16 August 2009,"Jason Statham, Saffron Burrows, Daniel Mays, Steven Campbell Moore, Mike Jibson and James Faulkner are all part of ""The Bank Job,"" a 2008 British film about a bank robbery that took place in the '70s. The script is based on true elements, apparently, that are pulled together into one feasible plot. A young woman, Martine Love (Burrows) is framed for bringing drugs into the country, and the charges are dropped in exchange for her getting some of her low-life friends involved in a bank heist. Who's behind the bank heist? Just the British government, which wants no connection with it. They want Martine to bring in the contents of one safety deposit box, which contains compromising photographs of Princess Margaret, and they don't care what happens to the rest of the loot. If the robbers get away, they get away. If they don't, they don't, but no one will connect them with the government.Turns out the bank safety deposit vault is quite popular. A madam keeps compromising photos of British officials there. A porn king keeps a book with payoffs to authorities there. When the boxes are robbed, everybody, for their own reasons, wants the robbers.This is a very exciting film, with lots of action, as well as plenty of violence, some of it gross, as various factions go after the contents in possession of the robbers.There apparently was such a big robbery in the '70s, and the criminals were never caught; there have been compromising photos of Princess Margaret that have never been published; there was the John Profumo scandal - etc.! The acting is excellent, as is the Dick Clement and Ian LaFrenais script, and director Roger Donaldson keeps the pace going.Highly recommended.",The Bank Job
9,Quinoa1984,"enjoyable, quasi-conventional heist picture with cool Statham and some twists",7,7 March 2008,"The Bank Job has been compared to one of those 'classic' 70s crime pictures, where the story and characters are paramount to more trickery in the style. It's no Jean-Pierre Melville, to be sure, but the Bank Job isn't anything to really snub your nose at either. It is shot and edited, to be honest, much more like a 'usual' crime thriller of the 21st century (quick, hand-held, with a color saturation that is only excused for the fact that it's filmed in grungy, gray London) than a cool 70s era pic. But within the boundaries that director Roger Donaldson sets up, he knocks it out pretty well, if only in the sense that it's the kind of film that gets a better, or more involving for the audience, as the robbery and its convoluted consequences get more intense.Now, to some genre fans, you should be warned: this isn't some slam-bam action fest like out of the Italian Job, and it doesn't have necessarily a whole lot of ""hip"" dialog (there's some good zingers and quips, mostly in subtle jabs, British lines, or jokes on the one character who acts in porno movies) like some othe recent flicks in the genre. But its core story is compelling enough to carry any little flaws in the structure- by that, I mean, there's sometimes so much at stake that it leans towards becoming some kind of political thriller- by making it about the criminals, and they're ambitious, creative (if 'been there done that') style of drilling and tunneling into a bank vault. That it has its facts based on real events (which we're given way too much exposition on in the final title cards) gives it a boost as well.But if there is any reason to check out the film, aside from the nifty heist scenes and the cunning twists that become the whole host of characters, check it out for Jason Statham. He's an actor who seems to be at home in these near B-movie thrillers and (dare I say it) vehicles like the Transporter movies and the recent Crank (the latter I have not seen). He's the kind of actor that early on in his career (or as 'early-on' that I knew of) when he would pop up in a movie and I'd say ""oh, it's that guy again, he's pretty damn good"" (i.e. Guy Ritchie's first, and Statham's first two movies, and even Ghosts of Mars). Now, with the Bank Job, he comes about as close as he could ever at this point to being like a Steve McQueen. By that point of praise, I don't mean quite like he's a great actor. But, for what Staham, and by his own token McQueen, can do in a thriller with some brains, he can carry it like few others. For the Bank Job, he makes an excellent presence in an otherwise good, though not blow-me-away, heist picture, which is a big boost all by itself.",The Bank Job
10,michaelRokeefe,Interesting British bank caper.,8,22 July 2008,"Tense, taut and anxious. Very crisp cinematography and nicely paced. Terry(Jason Statham)is a car dealer just ""getting by"" and not wanting to mess things up for his new family by relying on his checkered past. But things are too tempting when an old flame and successful model Martine(Saffron Burrows)comes by with an offer to make him lead man in a foolproof bank robbery. The target is the safe deposit room of a bank on London's Baker Street. What Terry and his rag-tag, but apt crew doesn't know is that the boxes contain more than just a wealth of money and jewels...but also dirty little secrets of high interest to one of London's biggest underground porn lords, the top echelon of the British government, and even the Royal Family itself.I really enjoyed Statham in CRANK(2006)and he doesn't disappoint this time either, albeit a little reserved. Burrows is just absolutely stunning and enough acting ability to serve her purpose. Also in the cast: Daniel Mays, Peter Bowles, Alistair Petrie, Georgia Taylor and Michael Jibson.",The Bank Job

12,Theo Robertson,Interesting Take On The Formula,7,16 February 2014,"After seeing something in the region of 20 million British films released in the first decade of the 21st Century I eventually came to the conclusion that at least 19,999,990 were gangster films with a sub heading of "" Cheeky gangsters try and steal some money . Thank you for creating us Guy Ritchie "" . With a screen writing team of Le Frenais and Clements best known for their comedy scripts and with a starring role for Jason Statham who shot to fame in LOCK STOCK AND TWO SMOKING BARRELS one could be forgiven in thinking that THE BANK JOB sees Statham turn full circle and return to the sort of tongue in cheek movie that kick started the British cinema crime boom In some ways this is exactly how the movie plays out . A bunch of likable London geezers commit a heist only to find that some very unlikable villains aren't happy about it . Where it differs from the Guy Ritchie classic is that it's supposedly based on true events . You can work out who the real life Royal family member is but apart from that the rest of the characters are vague . It's interesting that the film ends with a caption saying that names have been changed to protect the guilty but one can't help thinking the guilty might only exist in the minds of the production team . It also leads to a rather incomprehensible ending that'll have you sneering "" yeah right "" Another problem is that Roger Donaldson is no Guy Ritchie . This isn't necessarily a major criticism and you do think perhaps if he did try to emulate Ritchie's style then he would have probably made a mess of it . It is some what noticeable that everything is a little bit flat and workman like on a visual level . Matthew Vaughen's LAYER CAKE did manage to bring something new and refreshing to the British gangster movie unlike here where everything chugs away nicely but there's nothing outstanding",The Bank Job

17,view_and_review,Standard heist movie with not so standard players involved,6,26 October 2021,"""The Bank Job."" What comes to mind when you hear such a title? If anything other than a heist movie comes to mind then you are being very imaginative. ""The Bank Job"" was, in a lot of ways, your standard heist movie, and in many ways it wasn't. Though directed by Roger Donaldson it had hints of Guy Ritchie in it.The movie took place in 1970 London. A Trinidadian Black radical and small time criminal named Michael X (Peter De Jersey) had some rather incriminating photos of a certain British royal. He kept the photos in a safe deposit box in Lloyd's Bank which kept him out of jail even with all of his criminal activity. Some MI-5 or 6 people wanted those photos, but also wanted to be distanced from whatever means were taken to get them. An agent named Tim (Richard Lintern) contacted a drug smuggler named Martine Love (Saffron Burrows) who contacted Terry (Jason Statham) who put together a crew to do the job. Once the job was done the real excitement and movement of pieces began.There is a lot to keep up with and you can easily get lost in who's who because there are so many characters representing so many different interests. I liked the pace of the movie and the general theme. I wasn't entirely behind any particular character, even Terry, which made the movie a little less enticing.",The Bank Job
18,neil-476,"Entertaining, with roots in truth",9,4 June 2008,"I must confess to some irritation. This movie arrived back at the multiplex for a special one-off guest reappearance, show starting at 8.00pm. So I arrived at 7.50, only to have to queue for 20 minutes for a ticket due to thousands of twittering young women going to see Sex And The City at various 8.10pm shows in 5 - count 'em! - 5 other screens. So I missed the start. Le lapin triste aka. not a happy bunny.But I got into it quickly. It's a British crime thriller starring Jason Statham (The Transporter). It cleverly weaves together a number of real-life events in 1971 into a ""this might be what happened scenario"" involving a bank robbery, the hidden purpose of which is to recover photographs revealing the sexual indiscretions of a certain British princess of the realm. The first half of the movie is the heist, the second half is what happens afterwards when our gang is at the mercy of the British establishment and also the underworld figures who want back sensitive items which have disappeared from their rifled safety deposit boxes.Although it is not without humour (it was written by Dick Clement and Ian LaFrenais, names well known to British TV watchers for having a long pedigree in comedy and comedy/drama), it's a fairly dark movie which sustains a moderate level of suspense throughout. All the cast are good, although David Suchet, Gerard Horan, and Peter Bowles all stood out in their own ways.It also delivers a sense of period and location well. Set in the Baker Street / Marylebone area, I can vouch for the sense of authenticity, because I lived and worked in that area at around that time.All in all, I enjoyed it quite a lot, and I recommend it.",The Bank Job
19,evanston_dad,Solidly Entertaining and Atypical Heist Film,8,27 August 2008,"This slick, no-nonsense thriller had me on the edge of my seat.The film is based on a true story, but take that for whatever it's worth. I don't know anything about the bank robbery portrayed in this film, so can't answer for its accuracy. But it's one hell of an entertaining movie.If you're going into it because you enjoy heist films, be warned: little attention is payed to the actual mechanics of this bank robbery. Instead, the film is much more about the people (police, thugs and MI5 alike) who become invested in seeing the bank robbers caught when it becomes known that the robbers targeted safety deposit boxes, and by extension the private information contained in them that could make or break the lives of many.Jason Statham heads up the cast of not especially well-known British actors, and aside from a rather out-of-place fight scene towards the film's climax, is asked to keep his action hero persona under wraps.Grade: A",The Bank Job
20,ferguson-6,Are you using a Jackhammer?,6,9 March 2008,"Greetings again from the darkness. Based the true story of a bank heist in 1971 London, this is a slick little movie with nothing really new to offer. Long time director Roger Donaldson is known for both fluff such as ""Cocktail"" and quasi-action films like ""The Recruit"". His best film is a bio-pic called ""The World's Fastest Indian"". While this one is not at that level, it is easily watchable, if ultimately a bit empty.Action star Jason Statham is trying to make the transition to real acting. His short-comings are obvious here in the scenes with his wife. Still, he has definite charisma as an action guy and is at his best in the few high-octane, testosterone-fueled scenes. The weakness of the overall cast is best exemplified by the fact that Saffron Burrows (""Boston Legal"") is the second lead in this. She is so awkward in front of the camera that everyone struggles playing off her. The rest of the gang is mediocre at best ... no real standouts.This one is not as much fun to watch as say ""The Italian Job"" because it lacks the action of the heist and the fun of planning. Here we get a few shots of some guys digging a tunnel. Most of the action occurs after the heist. The best part is realizing that less than 40 years ago, this job was pulled off by a gang of goofs in a major city like London.Go in with low expectations and you will find the film somewhat enjoyable.",The Bank Job
21,anaconda-40658,Bank on Statham!,7,13 May 2015,"The Bank Job (2008): Dir: Roger Donaldson / Cast: Jason Statham, Saffron Burrows, Stephen Campbell Moore, Daniel Mays, Richard Lintern: An entertaining yet terribly routine caper regarding a task gone wrong. Jason Statham stars as a criminal presented with a task of robbing the safe deposit boxes at a bank. He gathers a crew together but doesn't realize that their quest for wealth is actually a quest to obtain incriminating photos of authority figures. Structure is formula but screenplay is clever. Improvement for director Roger Donaldson who previously made such junk as Species and Dante's Peak. Statham does well trying to straighten out sabotage as well as complete the task at hand. Should viewers be applauding their actions? Perhaps not. Saffron Burrows plays an ex-girlfriend who lures him into this crime but he isn't sure whether she can be trusted. Other roles are either interesting or underused but they mainly serve as symbols for shabby screen writing. Among the supporting cast are Stephen Campbell Moore, Richard Lintern, and Daniel Mays and none of them appear to be scoring much in terms of a good career move here. Very similar to the original version of The Italian Job only the ending isn't nearly as clever. There is a lot of potential here yet the film still manages to fly south when failing to deliver a sense of purpose to an incomplete job. Score: 7 / 10",The Bank Job
22,gradyharp,A Bank Job Goes Wrong for All the Right Reasons,8,20 July 2008,"THE BANK JOB is first class entertainment - a well-written script (Dick Clement and Ian La Frenais) with many twists and turns, face paced direction (Roger Donaldson), and a reliable cast of actors who know this genre well. AND it is all based on a true event from 1970 when a bank heist in London resulted in a number of falls of the heads of government who were locking away their 'dirty underwear' in the safety deposit boxes of a quiet bank on Baker Street. A great, unique movie this is not, but it is one that provides close to two hours of complex but highly suspenseful antics that keep the viewer glued to the screen. Terry Leather (Jason Statham) isn't making it as a car salesman and has debts to pay to the crime world. He meets an old sweetheart Martine Love (Saffron Burrows) who proposes that Terry and his friends rob a bank that is due for security repairs and a fairly surefire safe means to instant wealth. Martine just happens to be working with a fellow who wants some rasty photographs of Princess Margaret in questionable sexual liaisons and has Martine setup the 'easy heist'. Terry and friends agree to the too-good-to-be-true venture and begin to burrow into the bank vault under cover of night and clever means. Once the 'keystone cops' of London arrive on the scene the comedy portion begins, but when Terry, Martine and friends successfully achieve their goal, all manner of complications occur and the ways in which police and governmental corruption color the picture makes for a solid ending. As a fine addendum, the true facts of this actual heist and resulting events are flashed on the screen before the closing credits. The cast (including such fine actors as Stephen Campbell Moore, Daniel Mays, Alki David, James Faulkner et al) seems to have a great time with the caper and there is just the right balance between suspense and comedy to make the movie work. And oh the secrets about naughty England we discover! Grady Harp",The Bank Job
23,The_Void,Well made and exciting modern crime caper,8,8 June 2009,"I wasn't in a rush to see this film in spite of the fact that I love crime capers; and that's because I had it figured for yet another Pulp Fiction-style modern crime film. After the first ten minutes, I feared that my fears had been confirmed; but as the film moves on, it grows into itself and turns into one of the most exciting and entertaining crime thrillers of this decade. The film takes place in the seventies and focuses on a real bank robbery (although I suspect that certain elements of it were made up). What's interesting is the way it ties in to actual history and features several real people in the plot line. The plot focuses on an indebted garage owner named Terry. He is told by a former girlfriend that one of the local banks is having a new alarm fitted and will be off over the weekend, and comes up with a plan to rob the place. What Terry and his chum's don't know is that a secret government agency is behind the whole thing; and want the motley crew to rob the bank in order to retrieve some photographs that are being used by a Trinidadian to blackmail the UK government.The film stars Jason Statham, who is absolutely perfect for his role. The actor obviously gets type-cast all the time; but when he plays this sort of role so well, who could possibly complain? The plot moves very quickly and there's plenty of snappy dialogue; some of which I doubt existed in the seventies; but it still works well. The bank job obviously takes centre stage, and it's a rather daring robbery in the way it's played out. The film is more than that, however, and just as important as the actual robbery itself is the implications of it. The repercussions for the Government, the criminal underworld and various other parties provide plenty of interest once the robbery has been and gone. Contrary to other modern crime films, this one does not put its focus on violence either. There is a little bit, but it never goes over the top and it's always the story that takes the main focus. The film boils down to an exciting and suitable conclusion that ensures that everything ends on a high. Overall, this is certainly one of the best crime films in years and comes highly recommended!",The Bank Job
24,mm-39,Good film,7,12 March 2008,"Well casted and directed. The movie has a strong cast. Many of the minor(mi 5 and the cops) characters have very anal attitudes, which get across as very analytical. The minor characters behavior and facial expressions show way to up tight attitudes. Being so wounded tight all the time everyone creates a need to vent sooner or later and that is why those picture in the vault were so incriminating. The movie is about dirty secrets. The pickle these people were in. Nothing is so easy and when the robbers were found out by mistake and even bigger pickle is created for them, and the robbers created a bigger pickle for the others by their reaction. I get the film's message. Brilliant! Stay clean and stay out of a pickle. M5 bought the robbers off in order to stop the damage. 7 out of 10.",The Bank Job
25,DICK STEEL,A Nutshell Review: The Bank Job,9,8 July 2008,"If I remember it rightly, the very first time I saw Jason Statham star in a movie, it was in Guy Ritchie's Snatch, and since then he's had his fair share of crime capers ranging from the remake of The Italian Job where he starred as Handsome Rob, to mindless, high octane action movies like The Transporter series where he's the star vehicle (pardon the pun). While these movies can't possible earn him any action awards, you can't deny the fact that this guy's pretty charismatic in his own right, and I've no qualms about watching him play characters on either side of the fence, taking on his opponents in Crank or War, holding his own opposite Jet Li.While we await for the next installment of The Transporter or Crank, or The Brazilian Job, his The Bank Job sure took longer than expected to make its way to our shores, where the DVD should be released later this week. But as always, I'd recommend to watch this bank caper on the big screen. Don't expect plenty of Statham's signature moves when he takes on his opponents here, as he relies pretty much on his wits in order to survive a web of tangled intrigued where a simple open and shut case of a bank heist, turned out to be much larger than his team could digest, involving, check this out - high ranking government officials, the royal family, the British secret service, local neighbourhood cops, local neighbourhood crooked cops, gangsters, brothel owners, a society rebel, and an old flame. Phew!Based loosely on the Baker Street Llyods Bank robbery in 1971, Statham stars as Terry Leather, a two-bit lowly crook who's given an opportunity by Martine Love (Saffron Burrows) to break into the said bank, given inside information about the bank's security systems, and unknown to Leather, having the heist unofficially sanctioned by people in the right places. The job is simple, to break into the bank vault where the safe deposit boxes are, and make away with everything inside. But of course the real value lies in some incriminating photographs found within the boxes, and I thought this played out like The Inside Job.Only that it doesn't primarily take place from within the bank most of the time. The Bank Job covers a much larger spectrum, of conspiracies and trust issues between the members of the heist, as well as between shady characters who each have their own agenda of self- preservation. With plenty of dirty little secrets hidden snugly inside those safe deposit boxes, their respective owners while having a sense of fear permeate through their bones upon hearing the news, more so want to uncover the culprits, and recover their assets. It tells of the unwanted trouble and attention brought towards the perpetrators, as they realize that their apparently simple job, turns out to be a Pandora's box.If this was enacted based exactly on case files, then you can't help but to chuckle at how sometimes Fate and just plain silly luck would shine upon the players of the game, and enable coincidental circumstances to happen in order to have everything work out in a certain favour. And in either half of the story, from the enactment to the untying of the knotty situation they're stuck in, The Bank Job fulfills in keeping things light, funny, and given the many shenanigans that politicians get themselves into, it just reminds you that some things don't change.Those looking for elaborate plans and probes in heist movies Ocean Eleven style will be disappointed, but if you're looking for something leaning toward spy versus spy stuff and one-upmanship, with a classic underdog story to boot, then The Bank Job should already be in your must-watch list this week!",The Bank Job
26,Smells_Like_Cheese,"Finally, 2008 has a movie to brag about!",9,14 April 2008,"I was watching Ebert and Roper the other day on TV and they were discussing 2008's movies and how over all they have been disappointed, I think we all have. But they did discuss the top movies to see and The Bank Job was in their top three, I finally found a theater that was still playing the movie, I saw it today and I have to say that I really loved this heist movie. It's definitely one of the better heist movies in a very long time because it brings something different to the table, this isn't a movie about the heist, it's the aftermath of the heist. We are always usually left wondering if the robbers got away with the heist afterwords in movies. Now this movie is based on a true story, it's based in the 1970's(bonus it doesn't remind you every 10 minutes) and it's about just amateur robbers that pulled off one of the largest heists in England's history with finding corrupt cops and ending badly.Martine Love approaches Terry Leather, an amateur thief and long time friend. She offers information to get into one of the biggest heists they could hit, the ability to break into a vault. Terry and his group successfully break into the vault and takes four million pounds, including jewelery, cash, bonds, and some extremely private and damaging photos of the mobsters and government of England. When the group just about gets away with it, things go terribly wrong when one of the members are captured and they found out there was an alterer motive to this heist.The Bank Job has great acting, terrific editing, and is just a great thriller that truly keeps your attention. Jason Statham, this guy has never really stood out to me as someone who could be a good actor, most of his movies could never display what he could do, but The Bank Job is without a doubt his finest role to date that I'm aware of, he pulls the part off well and makes the story more real. The Bank Job has great drama and action, it's a great movie that I'm really glad I saw, a big recommendation if you're looking for a good movie to watch.9/10",The Bank Job
27,sddavis63,A Pretty Decent Movie With A Wild Ride To The Finish,7,24 August 2009,"The movie started off strangely and almost lost me. The opening scenes were of someone secretly taking pictures of a sexual romp. It seemed totally out of step with what I thought the movie would be about, and I wondered for a moment if I had the wrong movie, or if this was going to turn out to be some sort of soft-porn movie. Then, the scene shifts abruptly to London, and the implication of the next few scenes seems to be that this will be a fairly standard, cliché story about a guy who owes money to unsavoury characters and pulls off a bank robbery to save himself. As it turns out both initial impressions were wrong. In fact, this turns out to be a fairly interesting and entertaining (even moreso because it's based on an actual event) story of a bank robbery set up by the British Secret Service to save a member of the Royal Family from embarrassment.The characters are interesting, and run the gamut from a smut/port king to MI5 agents to both honest and corrupt cops. The most interesting character is probably Michael X, a British black nationalist leader (who models himself after Malcolm X) and who is very mysterious throughout (a mystery that grows at the end of the movie as one of the closing captions tells us that his file is being kept secret by British authorities until January 1, 2054. What was this guy up to?) Unfortunately, the least interesting character here was probably Terry. That's unfortunate because he's also the central character in the story, and yet there was nothing about him that gave me any kind of strong reaction. He struck me as pretty bland compared to everyone else.The movie really flies in the last few scenes, once Terry sets up the ultimate confrontation at Paddington station. As most of the central characters in the movie finally come together at the same time, it becomes quite a ride. 7/10",The Bank Job
28,Buddy-51,solidly crafted crime drama,8,2 November 2009,"Terry Leather is a shady car dealer in East London who finds himself in hock to a local gangster who's putting the screws on those who owe him money. Desperate for some quick cash, Terry allows a former friend and model to trick him into helping pull off a major bank heist, unaware that he and his buddies are actually being used by the British authorities to steal some scandalous photos that, if published, could seriously embarrass the royal family. The potential blackmailer is a black radical who models himself on Malcolm X and who thinks he holds the upper hand with the authorities as long as he is in possession of the pictures, which he has put in a safety deposit box in Lloyds Bank. Terry and his crew, unaware of the back story and convinced there is a fortune to be had for the taking, fall right into the authorities' trap, bearing all the risk should the scheme somehow fail, yet sharing in few of the rewards should it come off as planned.Based on an actual event that took place in 1971, ""The Bank Job"" is a solid, old-fashioned heist drama directed by Roger Donaldson with a super-abundance of suspense, energy and style. There are twists and double crosses aplenty in the screenplay by Dick Clement and Ian La Frenais, which uses the bank robbery as a mere jumping-off point for a scathing survey of the London crime scene, ranging from the lowest levels of two-bit thievery to the upper reaches of police and governmental corruption. There's also just enough uniqueness in the setup to keep us from feeling we know where the story is heading while it's still playing itself out. Despite a rather large cast of characters, we're usually able to keep most of the people straight during the course of the drama, though there are a few moments in the back half of the film where a little more clarity might have been helpful.In a bit of a change-of-pace for himself as an actor, Jason Statham gets to shed his ""Transporter"" action-hero image in favor of a more recognizable working-class stiff and family man who happens to have a serious penchant for running afoul of the law. Also compelling is Saffron Burrows - a dead-ringer for a young Charlotte Rampling - who stars as the seductive go-between who lures Terry and his men into a plan that may well lead to their undoing.The Great Bank Robbery of 1971 had the dual effect of not only turning villains into heroes but of helping to purge much of the corruption and rot lurking in the top echelons of British society. It's a fascinating piece of twentieth century history brought to vivid and memorable life in a gripping and stylish film.",The Bank Job

33,bowmanblue,Who are the criminals here?,8,17 June 2014,"Don't be fooled by 'The Bank Job' having Jason Statham as 'top billing.' If you've seen any of his films in recent years, you may think that this is just another 'kick-ass' kind of mindless film. Luckily, it's much better than that.It's about a gang of London bank robbers who get - unknowingly - recruited by MI5 to break into a bank and steal some photos which mustn't ever be made public. It's 'based on a true story,' by which I mean that there are definitely some facts on display here and the bits that aren't facts have been 'filled in' to make it a better story.However, I wouldn't dwell on how true every aspect is. If you did that you may not enjoy it. True or not, it's a twisty-turny kind of affair where you don't know what's coming next. It's almost like a Guy Richie film without Guy Richie having anything to do with it. Like 'Lock Stock' and 'Snatch' The Bank Job features multiple sets of dodgy characters whose lives are seemingly separate, until they're eventually brought together.The opening segment is a little slow, but stick with it. Whether you just like Guy Richie films, British films, gangster or heist films, there should be something to entertain most people here. Even if you don't like any of those genres, it also makes a damn good thriller, too.I don't know how true the story was, but, as the credits are rolling, even if you don't believe it happened just the way you've witnessed, it's the kind of story that you can't help but feel is quite capable of happening.http://thewrongtreemoviereviews.blogspot.co.uk/",The Bank Job

35,g-bodyl,Very Clever Film!,9,21 December 2013,"The Bank Job is a smart, effective, and one of the best thrillers regarding bank heists I have seen. I knew I would like this because as an American, I do have a sweet spot for British films whether they are thrillers or comedies. This film starts off a little slow with some character-building and effective it is, but the action picks up halfway trough and there the action picks up and never stops.Roger Donaldson's film is based off the true story of the 1971 London bank heist which surprised many people. It's about a criminal underground guy named Terry Weathers and his shady gang who are hired to take on a bank all while being involved with the MI:5, a porn king, and other corrupt public officials.The acting is pretty good. The only actor who is pretty famous is of course, Jason Statham. He shows off his acting chops here dramatically but that doesn't mean to say he does not kick some butt. He does have some good butt-kicking scenes towards the end.Overall, this is a great, entertaining British heist film. I liked how the film doesn't focus primarily on the action, but it focuses on the audience getting to know and even like the main characters. The action is still there of course, but every bit of characterization helps. I think that is what the British excel at regarding film. I rate this film 9/10.",The Bank Job

38,slightlymad22,One Of Stathams Best,7,19 January 2015,"The Bank Job maybe Jason Statham's best movie (excluding his role in the first Expendables movie) I really enjoyed it it is not your usual Statham movie. Plot In A Paragraph: Based on a true story Martine (Saffron Burrows) offers Terry (Statham) a tip on a foolproof bank job on London's Baker Street branch of Lloyds bank. She targets a roomful of safe deposit boxes worth millions in cash and jewellery. But Terry and his crew don't realise the boxes also contain a lot of dirty secrets - secrets that will endanger the lives of everyone involved. It does get bogged down with too many subplots in its short running time and there are some awful attempt to cockney accents. However these are only a minor flaws in an entertaining movie.In its edition of February 16, 2008 The Daily Mail newspaper reported ""The four men caught, charged and convicted of the raid went to jail without ever having their names mentioned in the press, and to this day their identities and the circumstances of their capture remain secret. Even the lengths of their sentences are still shrouded in mystery.""",The Bank Job
39,johnnyboyz,"It's a deal, it's a steal, it's the royal scandal of the century - apparently.",7,14 March 2009,"The Bank Job is a colourful and quite cheery film on mere face value, but what lurks beneath and quite clearly by the end is a film showing more the effects of attempting to live a life of crime, no matter how innocent or ignorant they may have been when they committed the act. Once the robbery does happen, that in itself kicks off a whole chain of events that endangers the gang we focus on. Such is the change in both content and atmosphere post-robbery, when there is a general sense of panic as well as a torture scene that it feels as if the film has matured somewhat; grown up out of the flashy and Ritchie inspired knock-about caper and rather merged into something else, a tale of survival as these petty criminals just try to survive as they take on the British government.What makes The Bank Job stand out, I think, is its very deliberate attempt to establish itself as one thing before branching out. It's post-robbery unravelling of events moves the more typical British gangster or, in this film's case criminal, out of a comfort zone more associated with British crime films and pits them against an opponent or 'foe' they are quite clearly out of depth against. If American crime or gangster films are usually more focused on the progression up a hierarchy within the criminal world and British films of this genre are more concerned with everyday criminals of a much lower rank mingling amongst one another, then The Bank Job is exactly that for one half before moving the criminals out of their comfort zone and forcing them to confront forces above them or forcing them to take on some sort of hierarchal challenge, hence the definite 'shift' in tone and content.It's an interesting approach, something that was done with far more success in another recent British gangster film Layer Cake, which took time to establish a 'world' and a life for its protagonist before thrusting them into confrontation with forces they really, in truth, either didn't want to go up against or had no knowledge to the fact they were meddling in their affairs in the first place. If you can recall it, Craig's character in that film was dabbling in affairs linked to a powerful mafia boss' daughter.The Bank Job sees Terry Leather, played by Jason Statham in the sort of role he's able to sleepwalk through nowadays, who is in his own comfort zone of sorts in selling cars and living a relatively 'straight' life despite being in debt to someone powerful enough to send people round to scare him. His weakness is lack of cash and female link Martine (Burrows) tells him of a London based bank whom are disabling their alarms for a short time, thus allowing time for a job in which a team would be able to burrow in underneath into the safety deposit box vault. Rather than act as some sort of siren with the potential to lure Terry to his potential doom in regards to the job, Martine merely offers him the chance and due to his financial situation, Terry is very open to the idea and accepts.So early on it's all very simple, fun even, as Terry rounds up his crew consisting of misfits young and old, dumb and educated but always helping one another out when required. This instigates a couple of reasonably suspenseful sequences such as a policeman on his beat paying a random visit to the shop the crew have rented and are subsequently using to burrow from. Additionally, when an amateur radio operator overhears the robbery on the team's two way radio, it produces a police search of all the local banks for anything out of the ordinary. It is simple and unspectacular but it delivers. What they are really in there for though, are certain photographs of a member of the royal family engaging in acts the government would rather have kept under wraps. The photos are possessed by a Trinidadian militant named Michael X (De Jersey), who is using them as blackmail to save himself from police interference in his own shady activities.Prior to the robbery, the gang see off a good friend of theirs after he is married and quite obviously on the brink of a new chapter in life with his new wife. It echoes the situation Terry and his crew will find themselves in, on the cusp of an event that will give them their own springboard in life, albeit through desperation for money instigated trough a crime orientated event. Entangled in with all this going on are certain scenes that pause to reflect the results of Terry's actions, when he has a disagreement with his wife Wendy (Hawes) once she finds out what he did and the possible repercussions that will destroy both of them and their family. You cannot fault the film for energy and it deals with its would-be labyrinth narrative rather well when everything gets really involved. It's also interesting to see a film which uses a heist as its initial incident for a setting up of things but rather than have all the criminals betray one another for the loot, do the opposite and come together as they realise they've bitten off more than they can chew. The Bank Job is pulpy, punchy entertainment that works in this regard.",The Bank Job
40,TheMovieDiorama,The Bank Job robbed its characters of any personality.,5,16 February 2019,"This is one of the more mainstream British crime flicks (along with Ritchie's 'Lock Stock' and 'Snatch'), mainly because Statham and a plethora of stars from acclaimed British TV are stamped on the front cover as if it was a gossip magazine. But at the end of the day, it's just another heist thriller that surprisingly has an underdeveloped robbery to make room for corrupted police officers, militant gangsters and members of parliament enjoying some seductive role playing in a brothel. All connected through plot conveniences that even the characters themselves are confused by. Based on the true story of a bank robbery successfully taking place where a safety deposit box containing incriminating photos of powerful individuals is stolen. Statham and his gang of cockneys do their best to keep the story swiftly moving, and with that there are some enjoyable lighter moments. Donaldson's direction is often electric and meticulously weaves various plot strands and a wide range of characters into an involving story. As with most bank heists, it's often formulaic and so therefore we look for character interactions to keep the crime engaging. But due to the robbery (including its conception) actually only taking up a third of the film's runtime, it doesn't allow any personality to shine through. These ""propa"" robbers were incredibly dull as they unrealistically drilled quickly underground to the bank vault. Plot conveniences were littered throughout, including its conclusion, but the most noticeable would've been the accidental dropping of a certain walkie-talkie which inadvertently fooled the police. Makes for a badly constructed plot if you ask me. The lack of action is certainly appreciated (as I'm sure Statham wanted to wreck gangsters with just a jewelled necklace) and, again, it is watchable. It just offers nothing new in a sub-genre that is pretty tired, the main event being rushed and the characters themselves being borderline sleep-inducing.

41,Movie_Muse_Reviews,Fresh heist story that happens to be partly true,8,28 August 2009,"""The Bank Job"" is fun, so much fun that you kinda have to stare awkwardly at its ""based on a true story"" tagline. Did a bank robbery where the press was blacked out really happen? Was it really set up as a government operation to retrieve critical blackmail photos of Princess Margaret? Speculation aside, ""The Bank Job"" hardly needs its truth disclaimer. It's a good story taking a different angle on the overdone British heist thriller. Its place in history only makes it the more unique.First of all, don't be worried of about this being just another Jason Statham movie. The Transporter and Crank series star has finally piloted something genuinely creative here. For one thing, the film takes place in the '70s. With that comes a whole different look to the heist movie and no fancy technology either.The story has Statham's character Terry and his band of amateur criminals being offered a unique bank robbery opportunity by an old friend, Martine (Saffron Burrows). What they don't know, is that Martine is doing this to clear her own record and has set them up to a do a job for the government: retrieve incriminating photos of Princess Margaret in the possession of Black Panther Michael X, who's using them to keep himself out of jail. The photos are in a safety deposit box in the bank in question.Half the film is the heist itself, then the second half its aftermath as the thieves find themselves being hunted by law enforcement, the government who put them there in the first place and the immoral men in power who want the photos back. We actually end up pitying Statham and his men because they had no idea what they were getting into.""Bank Job"" works very quickly to get the heist going and it's sort of choppy film-making for a good thirty minutes. After the characters and what's really going on with the government and all settles in, the movie takes off. Its non-traditional heist premise simply requires a good deal of set-up time. The characters are a little shallow, but they have clear goals and clear things at stake. Their amateur technique comes through and wins our sympathies despite their ignorance of radio technology and how they pop champagne bottles found in the deposit boxes before they've even left the bank.It's safe to say ""Bank Job"" is one of the better heist flicks made in awhile, with so many tired and repetitive stories being told. British TV writers Dick Clement and Ian La Franais deserve a lot of credit for finding this story, sealing the rights and bringing it to life in an entertaining and creative way, regardless how much is actually true.~Steven C.

42,jzappa,"A Stale, Commercial Waste of Good Material",6,2 September 2008,"The story of the Baker Street bank robbery is perfect for an exciting thriller. The poster of this movie is a 1970s-style shot through the driver's side window of an old-fashioned sports car, out of which Jason Statham determinedly looks. These are the surefire appeals of The Bank Job. Unfortunately, it is treated with the most washed-up commercial attitude one can imagine being practically applied to it. It panders to the horniest, most easily stylistically dazzled of the 18-25 male target audience, rushing through itself, leaving no time to gather all the pieces of itself it leaves behind along the way. Where is it rushing? To the bank, duh. And it made it! It opened at number four in North America based on its performance in just a little over a thousand theaters.Jason Statham, who can now play the likable anti-hero in his sleep, plays an ex-small time hood who owns a deteriorating car garage, hassled by two loan sharks. His old girlfriend Saffron Burrows seduces him into a bank robbery on Baker Street in London, which would of course clear up all his debt. So he gathers a bunch of old friends from his days as a thief to be his crew. We've seen the heist dozens of times, even done by Woody Allen, but to see it with the knowledge that it is chronicling true events makes it exciting: They lease a shop near the bank and start digging a tunnel underneath the middle shop to reach the bank vault. The girlfriend, however, has been caught smuggling heroin into England and desperately wants to avoid jail, is setting them up on behalf of so sets up the heist crew to take the fall for her on behalf of the authorities, who want the mysterious contents of one of the safe deposit boxes.What happens from there is quite cool. But the film sleepwalks through it after having subjected us to stick figure characters. Statham is every tough guy thief we've seen in every heist flick. His cronies are at once jackoff comic reliefs who mean to enter the porn business and are also cool and swaggering. The worst is Saffron Burrows's girlfriend character, who is entirely devoid of a personality not just due to the script's womanizing neglect of it, as we're of course supposed to accept her for her breasts and smooth voice and nothing further, but also due to Burrows, who is the last actress in the world who would ever flesh out a character like that. She never emotes and has no significant presence, which proves the filmmakers' lack of intent to put her character on the same level as the rest of them. She is a token plot- mover, but to be fair, so is everybody else.The movie even neglects to depict a rich 1970s atmosphere. The cars, of course, are vintage '70s, and there is some consideration give to the free love movement, but the music, the comportment of the people, and the detail in the sets do not pertain at all to the era in which its story is set. Frankly, it makes the era interchangeable. In fact, the whole film is interchangeable.",The Bank Job
43,Vartiainen,Bunch of C-rate criminals rob a bank for the secret service,7,5 May 2020,"A British comedy heist film starring Jason Statham and a whole bunch of other great British actors. Loosely based on a real London bank robbery that happened in 1971. To this day some members of the robbery gang have eluded capture and it's still very unclear just what was stolen from the numerous safety deposit boxes. Plenty of rumours to go around, which in turn inspired this movie.What makes this movie so enjoyable is first of all its quintessential Britishness, but also the fact that these criminals are quite frankly just a bit above rank amateurs. They clearly don't have all the details worked out and they're constantly stumbling into new problems and complications.The back story containing the secret service is also rather interesting, although it of course takes some liberties from published sources. I mean sure, it is not impossible that the secret service was pulling the strings behind the scenes, but I somewhat doubt it. Makes for good cinema, though.If I had to point out a flaw, I'd say the final third of the film doesn't quite manage to pull itself together. When all these separate factions start colliding, it becomes a bit of a mess. Likewise the ending, which deviates quite noticeably from real life events, is on the saccharine side of things.Still, for a heist movie this was delightfully different from the norm.",The Bank Job
44,jtindahouse,Not your typical Jason Statham film,7,2 September 2020,"'The Bank Job' is not your typical Jason Statham film. It has a lot less action and a lot more, for lack of a better word, maturity about it. It's surprisingly grounded for a bank heist movie. Only the British could have done a movie like this, the Americans would have made it completely differently. The only thing that did feel a little American was the willingness to show some pretty extreme violence in different parts. The use of nudity was also a lot heavier than I expected going in. I enjoyed the film, without ever really loving it.I know the film was set in the 70s, but it really bothered me how easily things were done. This would have to be the most incompetent bank in the history of banks. No cameras, no alarms, not even any systems in place for if things are suspected of going wrong. It made the bank heist element of the film not have to be that clever. 'Ocean's Eleven' would be rolling in its grave.The film moves at a reasonable clip. The pacing is pretty tightly put together. Even though there is a distinct lack of action, the film never feels like it's dragging for this reason. This was one of those films I'm glad I've seen, but I'm unlikely to remember much about it in a months time. Worth a look, but don't get too excited about it.",The Bank Job
45,Chris Knipp,Burrowing underground,7,20 March 2008,"In this serviceable but not extraordinary film based on real events and set in 1971 London, a group of amateurs pull off a bank robbery that goes wrong in a lot of interesting ways. Prompted by an ex-model former girlfriend named Martine (Saffron Burrows), Terry (Jason Statham) recruits a group of friends to tunnel into the safety deposit vault of a Lloyd's Bank on Baker Street. The alarms at this particular branch are temporarily off for adjustment of a new system, just as Martine told Terry they would be. The metal drawers hold millions in jewelry and cash. Things seem pretty dicey more than once during the ambitious robbery, but the crew does succeed in taking away the loot.It's not the robbery that matters, though, but the complications arising from the fact that in the drawers besides money and diamonds there are a lot of dirty secrets (the phrase ""Pandora's box"" is even used). The madam of a fancy brothel has stashed photos of high level gents and ladies doing all sorts of naughty things at her establishment. Another box contains records of a Soho porn czar's payoffs to a corrupt police officer. And still another has scandalous snapshots belonging to the sleazy slumlord and fake black radical, Michael X (Peter De Jersey), kept to blackmail the government. These include photos of an adulterous royal, Princess Margaret, and it's the need to conceal her scallywaggery that's prompted a boss at MI5 named Everett (Richard Lintern), who's been dating Martine, to set off the whole caper, calling on her because she's said she knows some ""villains."" She must comply, because he's gotten her off a drug-running charge.The Bank Job has a retro feel; unfortunately a mid-level director like Donaldson can't really compete with the best of the old heist flicks this one resembles in its more mechanical aspects. For instance, a foreign expert is brought in, and he gives a demonstration in a basement, much like Cesar le Milanais in Jules Dassin's Rififi--but the memory is devastating, because this movie is nowhere near as fresh and suspenseful and atmospheric as that Fifties gem. Of course this isn't meant to be taken quite that seriously--though it isn't meant to be farce either; it's too involved in its reinvention of real events for that. There's a successful effort to make the accents and lingo authentic, and the grungy images achieved by cinematographer Michael Coulter and intrusive music (by various hands) sort of evoke the Seventies. Unfortunately in all the complicated stuff that happens, this movie forgets what it wants its tone to be. Sometimes it's light and funny, sometimes it's just factual and hurried, and when the cohorts get tortured by the nasties, it's pretty grim.The subplots of the parliamentarians and the MI5, crooked cops and porn dealer Vogel (David Suchet), Terry's straight family life with two girls and wife Wendy (Keeley Hawes), at times seem overly complicated, but the movie would collapse without them, and film editor John Gilbert deserves credit for keeping things energetic and flowing by shifting scenes in ways that make this machine seem to be running on all four cylinders. The writing of Dick Clement and Ian La Frenais, an experienced pair with some admirable credits, can't be faulted from page to page; but they're trying to weave in too much material. There's another subplot of a ham radio operator who by chance intercepts the robbers' walkie-talkie communications between Terry and his rooftop lookout Eddie (Michael Jibson). All things considered it's surprising all this stuff flows as well as it does. Lively English acting helps here to make the various groups of characters, especially Terry's team, not hard to keep track of. Jason Statham stands out, with his big face, short hair, and perpetual three-day's growth of beard. That may not be a very Seventies look (and indeed the Seventies are sometimes forgotten in the film), but he has an intensity that makes his character feel stronger and more authentic than even the most able of the other cast members; it's his film, and that's another thing that helps save The Bank Job from becoming totally mediocre. It has a strong center.The ham radio interception gave the robbery its press name, ""the walkie-talkie bank job."" The police still couldn't pinpoint which bank the voices were coming from, but they broadcast tapes of them on commercial radio the next day seeking identifications. The job was done on Sunday, and Monday morning of course Lloyd's employees find out which bank was robbed soon enough. Several of the robbers come to grief when captured by the crooked cop and his porn associate, but four days after the robbery the government issues a a D notice, forbidding any further press coverage in the interests of national security, and the other fledgling thieves slip away, with mutual wink-winks and a turnover of all the incriminating materials to authorities. A majority of the box holders did not report their losses, end titles say, so by implication they were all up to skulduggery; even the money was largely dirty. Oh, those naughty Seventies.",The Bank Job

Here is one called ""The Bank Job"" from England which involves a small group of petty thieves who have decided to climb the ladder into the big time. Jason Statham plays the leader of a small time clique waiting for a big score. Enticed by a former girlfriend to rob the safe- deposit boxes in a bank, he wants no part of it. Unfortunately when told how much money they can net, he convinces his friends and they too are bitten by greed. What they don't know is that his girl is being pressured by some high officials to commit the robbery and they will dismiss the drug charges she is facing. However, there are more than just high officials involved, when the bank vault is opened and robbed. Aside from them, there are many corrupt policemen, notable criminals and radicals who also are afraid as the hidden contents are placed in jeopardy. The movie is very low profile for Stratham, but he and the superior cast take this drama and pitch it into one which should have garnered more attention from the public. The Eye candy in this film is delicious as is the gangland violence and backstabbing intrigue. This film is great in many ways, but one has to see it to appreciate it's directness. ****",The Bank Job
47,freemantle_uk,A right royal scandal,7,29 July 2010,"Bank robbery, gangsterism, corrupt coppers and establishment conspiracies, yes, that's 70s Britain for you. With the 70s backdrop the New Zealand director Roger Donaldson and veteran writers Dick Clement and Ian La Frenais take one of the biggest robberies in British history which was hardly reported. It has lead to accusations to a intelligence service conspiracy.Terry Leather (Jason Statham) is a ex-criminal who is in deep with two loan sharks. To get him out of his trouble his ex-girlfriend Martine Love (Saffron Burrows) tells him that the Lloyds' bank on Baker Street is having it's alarm system replaced and it's underground vault would be unprotected. And there is added bonus that the content of the safe-deposit boxes would be unreported. Terry and Martine form a team, Terry's petty crooks friends Kevin Swain (Stephen Campbell Moore), Dave Shilling (Daniel Burrows), a Cypriot mechanic (Alki David) and the conman, 'major', Guy Singer (James Faulkner). They plan to borrow from a rented shop to the bank. But what the crew don't know is that Martine was recruited by MI5 to retrieve embarrassing photos of a member of the Royal Family that civil rights activist and slum lord Michael X (Peter de Jersey) is holding to stop the CPS from prosecuting him. Brothel owner Sonia Bern (Sharon Maughan) uses the bank to keep embarrassing photos of public officials and gangster and porn king Lew Vogel (David Suchet) keeps a record of police officers he pays off. When the robbery is completed Terry and his gang ends up being chased by MI5, corrupt police officers and gangsters as they try and find a way out the country.Donaldson does have a mixed record as a director, but he had made good films in the past like The Recruit. He has a real eye for detail, capturing the spirit of the early 70s (which was influenced by the 60s) and allows The Bank Job to more along with a fast pace, from the preparations to the robbery to the chase. There is some action and has a fun feeling of a heist movie. He is made the film easy to follow despite the number of players in the film, adding a lot of intrigue. But Donaldson as a director is often more serious, with films like The Bounty and Thirteen Days, and the film was trying to be a little more light hearted. Donaldson did a good job, but I would have liked to have seen what Guy Ritchie or Matthew Vaughn would have done with the material.The acting throughout the film is decent, not was bad (except the children but their roles were small), but no one was exceptional either. Statham is a decent enough actor and The Bank Job is one of his best films outside the Guy Ritchie films. He is actually an actor in the film and not an action star, even though he does get to use his martial arts skills. Admittedly a few of the characters are a little clichéd, MI5 officers being very posh and want to keep the status quo going for themselves, crooked cops who want money and sex, salt of the earth, cheeky cockneys and clichés of posh people. It's not the actor's fault, but there could have been a little more effort to play against the clichés.The film if fun, but it is a fictional account of the robbery. The only thing we really know is that a robbery happened. The rest is based on urban legend and coincident. If there photos they properly would have been sold to a newspaper in Britain or abroad and that MI5 would have had a black ops team or use the SAS to get the safe deposit box. It felt little forced that film tried to link the events to Michael X and police corruption in the Met. Overall, 7.4 out of 10 would be a fair rating.",The Bank Job
48,ianlouisiana,"O.D.C.s get dumped on by ""Them""?You're avin'a tin barff.....",4,21 February 2015,"By 1971 nobody gave two hoots about who Princess Margaret had sex with.

She slept with the well - endowed John Bindon?Roddy Lewellyn,Peter Sellers..Mustique should have been ankle - deep in condoms...... The preposterous idea that ""The Establishment""(what a splendid catch - all term that is) should encourage a team of frankly not overly - bright London crims to do a safety deposit vault in order to get photos of Royal/Commoner action is the wellspring behind this creaky ""thriller""that is thirty years beyond it's sell - by date. The simple fact is that if the Security Services wanted to suppress the photos they simply had to serve a ""D"" notice on the Bank's Governors and walk out with them. All sorts of rumours were prevalent at the time about the real ""Baker St. Moles"",many set about by themselves. The self styled Michael ""X"" was a pimp and a violent criminal hiding behind the skirts of his community whilst presenting himself as it's saviour. He was later hanged in Jamaica where his ethnicity was not considered consequential. Without the silly Royal connection,""The Bank Job"" must stand on its merits as a ""Caper""movie but singularly fails to do so. The usual Brits turn up and do their posh or mockney turns,trouser the cash and go onto better things(or not,as the case may be). Mr Suchet gives a Michael Caine impersonation that entertains for about two minutes but unfortunately lasts rather longer. The Met scarcely covered itself in glory during the Baker St investigation and certain officers were quietly ""resigned"" in the aftermath of the affair - that much is true,but no real - life villains were ""disappeared"" or found hanging from Blackfriars Bridge or wherever a favourite subject for conspiracy theorists. The fact of the matter is that it was a crime that read better than it actually turned out. And,in ""The Bank Job"",it didn't even read that well.",The Bank Job
49,alindsay-al,An average heist film,5,5 October 2015,"I enjoy a good heist film so I decided to watch the bank job and its an average heist film. The premise of the film is based on true events that saw a bank robbery in the 70s which involved gangsters, politicians and MI5. I like Jason statham and he is really good in this movie. He is his usual gruff self in this film but you buy it and it really works for the film. However, in a heist film its really important to like the crew and apart from statham I didn't care about anybody else in this film. The crew were boring, the villains were boring and the politicians were boring. The story was a mixed bag for me, I liked the heist elements and thought overall that it worked pretty well. However, the film deals with corrupt cops and African terrorists and I didn't find any of it interesting. The script was incredibly bland except for a bit of well placed humour. The style of the heist was pretty cool but the grit of the film had nothing special about it and you forget about it pretty quickly. Overall this is an average movie that is very forgettable.",The Bank Job
50,MBunge,"If this isn't a true story, I wish it was.",7,26 October 2010,"The Bank Job isn't exactly a true story. Many of the things that happen in this movie did happen in England in the early 1970s, but they may not have been all connected in exactly the way this film links them all together. So, it's possible that government espionage, police corruption, political sex scandals, media censorship, black radical activism, the British Royal Family, an underground tomb and a ham radio operator all played a role in the greatest unsolved bank robbery in English historyor maybe they didn't. Either way, this is a fun little caper to watch.Terry Leather (Jason Statham) is a small time criminal now trying to make a living in 1971 running a car dealership in London. Then a woman he knew back in the day, former model Martine Love (Saffron Burrows), shows up to offer Terry and his villainous mates the score of a lifetime. Martine claims to be sleeping with a guy who told her a bank is having its security alarms replaced, leaving it unprotected for an entire weekend. Looking to get out from under his debts to a loan shark, Terry rounds up a crew to tunnel into the bank vault. What Terry doesn't know is that the whole robbery has been cooked up by British intelligence (MI-5 or 6, no one can keep them straight) to steal compromising photos of Princess Margaret from the vault, photos that fiery black radical, pimp and drug dealer Michael X (Peter De Jersey) has been holding over the government's head to protect himself from prosecution.What neither Terry nor British intelligence knows is that the vault also contains compromising photos of scores of English politicians, taken by a local brothel madam, as well as a ledger of payoffs to corrupt cops by porn king and whore monger Lew Vogel (David Suchet). When Terry and company realize what they've stolen is much more likely to get them killed than make them rich, they have to figure out how to maneuver their way past the cops, crooks and spies without winding up disappeared or dead.This is a very smart crime story that doesn't waste all it's brain power on a ridiculously convoluted robbery. The actual bank job is fairly straight forward, but it's only a small part of the overall story and all of its delightfully suspenseful complications. It's not just cops-n-robbers. It's cops-n-robbers-n-spies-n-feckless politicians-n-bad cops-n-even worse criminals and all of them wonderfully performed by a superb cast. Peter Bowles and David Suchet, known to most folks from ""To the Manor Born"" and ""Poirot"" on public television, are charmingly ruthless as an English spook and a seedy crime boss with a kidney stone. Jason Staham proves he can do much more than simply beat people up in highly choreographed fight scenes and Saffron Burrows and Peter De Jersey are perfect in their roles as jaded party girl looking for a new start and thug who uses his race and politics as a cover for unvarnished criminality.The Bank Job also has that distinctly proletarian view that distinguishes British crime dramas. In American cinema, crime stories are defined by the concept of the gangster, a figure who consciously separates himself from normal society to live by his own rules. In British movies, crime is treated like just another working class vocation. Terry and his buddies grew up to be criminals the way other men grew up to be carpenters or plumbers or house painters who play in a band on the weekends. It's a completely different understanding of the criminal in society and I find it endlessly fascinating to catch all the little things that are different than what would be in an American crime flick.",The Bank Job

Instead, this film is fast paced straight through, and doesn't stop with the fast cuts and nonstop talking until the end credits. Other than this being somewhat confusing if you're not paying close attention, I have very few other complaints. The nonstop action was such a huge problem, it bumped down this otherwise entertaining, and interesting flick.A group of people, rob a bank full of safety deposit boxes belonging to important people, with discriminating evidence against them. The job was easy, now it's the aftermath that will tear this group apart. All the acting was good, though super great acting wasn't needed for this, because no one ever had the chance to really show off their ability. There was not one emotional scene in the entire movie, which is good, in that the movie just goes through without being a drudgery, but it also leaves the characters underdeveloped. They are all developed in their background and professions, but none of the characters are easy to connect with, again because of the brisk speed. It's a pretty interesting plot, then when you think that this was based on a true story, it's quite amazing. This was a good movie, but it wasn't outstanding.My rating: *** out of ****. 105 mins.

What I saw was a film that didn't offend my intelligence, took some unexpected and delightful turns and constantly surprised me with his old fashioned storytelling style but very modern sensitivity.It is very hard to explain why the film worked so well, suffice to say that the performances are right on the money, each one giving us a portrayal of a member of a society that doesn't exist anymore. In spite of this, the film doesn't feel like a period piece, or is in danger of ever feeling dated. It is amusing, quick and clever. The situations never feel forced and are wholly dependent on a some avant garde tracking shot or a desperate attempt to showcase a technical skill. Here is a script that serves a purpose, to retell how an event had some unexpected consequences. We are treated to a movie with an intelligent screenplay, full of snappy exchanges between some adroit performers.Roger Donaldson has directed some very exciting movies before.

57,AudioFileZ,Spare Style Serves True Story of Tragic Bank Caper,7,13 May 2008,"This movie should be seen. It's both telling and cautionary. Without checks and balances power breeds corruptness...From the street corner to the highest levels. Though it happened in the seventies, I imagine there have been quite a few similar instances of clandestine government misappropriation of power since. This particular one was quite tragic and took many years to be completely revealed. It got hushed even with the ""good"" cops arresting quite a few unsavory figures and the press having some knowledge that it was more than just a robbery. The press would not let it go in today's connected world because if they did it would simply come out later on the internet.More to the point, the story begins as a powerful London based black rights advocate is in possession of explosively sexually incriminating photos of a ""Royal"". We're shortly made aware that he uses the potential national scandal from the unpublished pictures as a sort of ""get-out-of-jail-free"" card allowing him to do the real business he is in which is the illicit drug trade. He's a partner to a ""Dapper Don"" porn gangster named Lew Vogel. It's worth noting that David Suchet gives a performance portraying Mr. Vogel worthy of Sir Lawrence Olivier's menacing Dr. Szell from Marathon Man. That's high praise indeed. You get the feeling that Lew Vogel would sell his mother's soul as he seems devoid of humanity while appearing the picture of civility. Vogel thinks he is the great beneficiary in this drug sourcing relationship, yet it will prove to be his downfall not because of anyone in power wanting to stop illegal drugs. No, society will still allow a modicum of drugs, after all this the late sixties mentality. But, who is so stupid as to blackmail the British Monarchy? You soil ""The Crown"" and you go down...Right? Vogel's big faux-pas turns out to be the storing of his incriminating payoff book in the same Baker Street bank's safe deposit vault as Michael X's explosive photos, each party's items unknown by the other. This act sets up a domino effect of violence and death.Power, greed, and the ability to manipulate people, if not outcomes, come together to create this true sensational crime caper. It is uber-sensational as well as shockingly tragic, it shows a real lack of morality at the highest levels, the kind of corruption one suspects yet doesn't want to know exists. Jason Statham is the most sympathetic character here-and he's a car dealer who barely squeaks by as he turns back mileage on ""Terry Leather's Low Mileage Cream-puffs"".

58,RatedVforVinny,Interesting story based on bizarre truth.,6,15 December 2018,"A very interesting movie concerning 'The Safe Deposit Robbery of Baker St' in 1971. Based on a true story but we will (in fact) never know the complete truth, because the Home Office put a gagging order on the case. The film suggests it was over photos stolen of a Princess (a member of our own Royal Family) doing something very naughty in an orgy. Seems far fetched but it must be something of this magnitude because the 'perps' got away with millions and without ever fear of prosecution. The film implies the MI5 had no choice but to make a deal with the robbers, in return for their silence.",The Bank Job
59,gazzo-2,Very solid caper flick.,7,30 March 2008,"I thought that there was more to this than met the eye on first glance, too. Statham is a fine lead in the Bronson/Daniel Craig school of tough guys, his cronies all familiar faces. I liked seeing Poirot as a vile pornographer, and they even dragged Lord Mountbatten's name into all this-! really something else. Elliot Spitzer ain't got anything on these guy nossir.Is this a 'good' movie-? Sure. I liked the blue collar, nothing goes perfectly style that was used in the actual bankjob itself, as it was the crew weren't exactly pros. I liked seeing the bad cops and corrupts sleazebags in the gov't get haulted into the mix, plus the John and Yoko unspoken cameo was an eye-opener too! Things tie up pretty neatly towards the end, the one caveat I had were that I kept getting the two lead brunettes confused. Both have high cheekbones and look enough alike, so that you can be forgiven for thinking one is the other.This is a good solid film and worth your while, a def. B movie that does that genre proud.*** outta ****",The Bank Job
60,Galina_movie_fan,Big Trouble on the Baker Street,8,22 January 2015,"While watching The Bank Job (2008) by Roger Donaldson I could not help thinking how much it felt like a Guy Ritchie's movie, the best that he did not direct. The Bank Job is fast, smart, and so well made that I can only agree with Richard Rupert of At the Movies with Ebert& Rupert, ""The most entertaining heist movie I've seen in years"". It is based on the true story of the Baker Street robbery that involved a robbery of the safe deposit boxes at a branch of Lloyds Bank on the corner of Baker Street and Marylebone Road, London, and the following political scandal that the content of some of the boxes might have caused. The robbers were never arrested, and the cash, jewelry and the documents were never recovered. I am not sure how much truth is in the film but it works fine recreating the atmosphere of the 1970s with its political corruption, sex scandals that link to the highest circles, and the police incompetence.I mentioned Guy Ritchie above, and it seems that the colorful characters from the different layers of society that inhabited London in The Bank Job might have come directly from his early movies. The most decent and sympathetic turned to be the petty thieves led by Terry Leather (the role fits Jason Statham like a glove) while the owners of the stolen safe deposit boxes are mostly corrupt and despicable. Among them the members of the parliament who like to visit the fashionable London brothel, the leader of Black Power organization who keeps the compromising pictures of a member of British Royal Family in the coveted deposit box 118, and the porn-king of Soho (David Suchet) who makes the note of his every payment to the bent cops of London in the special book. Sushet, known to millions as a master of gray cells, the world famous Hercule Poirot, is here on the other side of the law. Perhaps, you won't remember this movie for its outstanding photography and spectacular scenery but as far as the level of entertainment and thrills goes, it is certainly a hit. And the big one.",The Bank Job
61,p-stepien,This is the job,7,1 March 2009,"One of the most entertaining movies of 2008 and it's a shame it didn't get wider release.Jason Statham is basically Jason Statham. And it seems likes he's been in every bank robbery movie in the last 10 years. So basically he's playing the same suave and bright Englishman he's been portraying from some time. Enough said that he fills his role perfectly... as usual.What really excels this movie is the script. Although you might see this film borrowing from flicks like Snatch or the Italian Job you are suddenly thrown into a totally different type of movie. The bank job is relatively simple and essentially is just the back-story. What really matters is the mayhem that occurs afterwards. Malcolm X wannabes, porn kings, corrupted cops, MI5 and sadomasochistic parliamentarians all feature on the way to this apparently based on a true story finale. Essentially unbelievable.The film had some minor faults, including clichés and slightly cardboard characters resulting from lacking build-up, but in essence this film is nearly perfect. Very refreshing after the over-the-top and unrealistic Ocean franchise or the remake of the Italian Job.Great entertaining fun and really a movie gem.",The Bank Job

This is a crime drama in ""caper's"" clothing.It leaves out the cheek and humor of ""Snatch"" and ""The Italian Job"" remake, and also the over-the-top jaw dropping action sequences of the movies like the ""Transporter"" series in favor of a glum, complicated plot full of conspiracy and double crosses and espionage.""The Bank Job"" isn't bad at all, mind you...it just doesn't have the energy level and the zing of many of his other movies and it isn't as much fun to watch. The cast is solid, but there's really no chemistry here between the characters, and Saffron Burrows is wasted in a role that occupies a lot of screen time, but doesn't really do her justice somehow.The last five minutes (before the ""coda"" at the end) throws a sop to the audience by letting Stadham's character beat the crap out of a couple bad guys, but it's too little too late, and the final scene between Stadham and his wife and Burrows is way too pat.Still, I like a lot of things about this movie...it just wasn't what I was hoping for.

63,bob-rutzel-1,Somewhat very good,9,18 July 2008,"This is based upon a true story in London in 1971.British Secret Service needs to get damaging photos of the Royal Family and allows Terry Leather (Statham) and his crew to rob the bank where the photos are in a safe deposit box. Of course, Terry doesn't know the Secret Service is behind this.I know, I know, if you've seen one bank heist you have seen them all , but this one is somewhat different. First of all it's based upon a true story; 2nd: each faction either performing the heist or monitoring it believe they are in control of what is going to happen; 3rd: ordinary people, not regular bank robbers, make up Terry's crew; 4th: no CGI (hey, this is 1971) or fancy electronic gadgets are involved; and 5th: no explosions, or car chases. (Okay, all those things aside is there something more that makes this ""somewhat different?""). Yes, well, the heist goes somewhat wrong, sort of, and the negotiations after the fact are what makes this movie exciting, and we are privy to the very real concerns of top echelons in the English government and corruption within the Police Force. (So it's just not about the sought-after pictures within this story?) That's correct..somewhat. All in all this is very good. I must point out that Richard Lintern II who plays Tim (who originally sets all this in motion  and does a good acting job) somewhat resembles a young Sean Connery who played James Bond, who was also a British Secret Service Agent if you recall. The rest of the cast performed exceedingly well.I know, I know, when you see Jason Statham's name you figure you will see a lot of kung-fu, karate type fighting. Well, surprise, surprise, surprise what you will see is a very good acting performance by one Jason Statham. 'Bout time too.

The sceneries and atmosphere is well adapted in the 70s. Jason Stratham convinced me in this role and looked cool. If you like this genre I recommend you to watch the much more thrilling ones as THE THOMAS CROWN AFFAIR, ENTRAPMENT or THE Italian JOB. Too overrated,I give with my wife 5/10.",The Bank Job
65,tomsview,Top job,8,6 June 2014,"As far as crime caper movies go, this is right up there with the best.The film has the added conviction that often comes with stories based on real events such as ""The French Connection"" and ""Munich"" to name a couple. The story takes place in 1970. A gangster, Michael X (Peter de Jersey) has some compromising photographs of a member of the royal family. He uses these as insurance against prosecution for his crimes. Tim Everett (Richard Lintern) of MI5 is ordered to get the negatives, but he is told to use unorthodox means so as not to incriminate the government. Through Martine Love (Saffron Burrows), a woman Everett has rescued from a drugs charge, a small-time criminal, Terry Leather (Jason Statham), is brought in to do the robbery. This entails tunnelling beneath two shops to get to the bank. Terry pulls together a team including a tunnelling expert. The icing on the cake in ""The Bank Job"" is the bank job itself. The robbery sequence is long, full of detail, and packed with tension. The film was directed by Roger Donaldson who had remade ""The Getaway"". Although Alec Baldwin didn't eclipse Steve McQueen in that effort, Donaldson's action sequences, which included a similar robbery, were a notch above Peckinpah's. Donaldson can also handle intense human drama as he proves here and in films such as the brilliant ""The Bounty"". The story is full of lewd lords and crooked cops, and the plot twists in all directions as other characters are drawn in whose secrets have also been exposed. Although the film starts with a light touch it becomes progressively darker as retribution comes from all directions. One of the aggrieved is brothel owner Lew Vogel (David Suchet) who makes a point that sums up a lot of the characters in the film. As his associates are about to work over one of Terry's friends with what looks like a sand blaster, he says, ""I have a very jaundiced view of life. From what I see most of it is corrupt, venal and vile, and I'm just saying this so you know that I don't have a better nature to appeal to or a compassionate streak"".""The Bank Job"" has a great cast. Jason Statham is perfect as Terry and Saffron Burrows adds class to any movie she is in. This is definitely one of Roger Donaldson's best.

67,seymourblack-1,"High-Level Blackmail, Corruption & Criminality",9,27 December 2013,"The title of this movie sets audience expectations at a very low level as it suggests that what's going to follow is a thoroughly predictable, run-of-the-mill heist thriller. Fortunately, nothing could be further from the truth. This fact-based story of one of the biggest bank robberies in British history is actually full of humour, suspense and interesting characters and focuses on a crime that ultimately had links to British Intelligence, the Royal Family and high-ranking politicians as well as a large number of corrupt police officers, a top London crime boss and a group of Black Power radicals. The robbery provides many moments of tension and amusement when things don't go precisely according to plan but what follows takes the story up to another level of excitement as the lives of the robbers suddenly come under threat from a whole variety of different directions.Dodgy used car dealer Terry Leather (Jason Statham) is deep in debt to a bunch of loan sharks whose thugs are getting progressively more threatening with each visit they make to his London east end business. When he's contacted by one of his old flames, an ex-model called Martine Love (Saffron Burrows) and she tells him about a low-risk, high-value bank robbery that she's interested in carrying out, he recognises that this could get him out of his current problems and make him and his family financially secure for life. Martine is extremely confident about the proposition because she's had some inside information about a precise period of time when the alarm system will be temporarily out of action.Terry knows that this type of job is out of his league and the crew that he enlists are similarly inexperienced but they all consider that the risks involved are worth taking because of the exceptionally high rewards on offer. What Terry doesn't know is that Martine is being blackmailed by an M.I.5 agent Tim Everett (Richard Lintern) who's interested in recovering some embarrassing photos of a royal princess which he knows are stored in a safe deposit box in the bank's vault. The photos need to be recovered to protect the Royal Family but also because they're being used by a Black Power leader to blackmail the government and protect him from being prosecuted for his various criminal activities.Certain aspects of Martine's behaviour raise Terry's suspicions that she may have a personal agenda but nothing prepares him for what they actually find amongst the cash and jewellery etc. Incriminating photos of the royal princess, prominent politicians and the Head of British Intelligence are all discovered in close proximity to a ledger full of recorded transactions which contain details of pay-offs made to corrupt police officers by a top London criminal who runs a porn empire. The events that follow get remarkably tense as everyone's lives are put in danger and Terry gets involved in some very difficult negotiations with people who are extremely powerful and ruthless.Terry Leather is the type of character who's very familiar to film noir aficionados i.e. a hapless protagonist who gets in over his head and then finds that every step he takes gets him in deeper and deeper. Jason Statham does well in this role and exudes a certain amount of charm as well as being convincing as a tough guy. The remainder of the cast includes some really good character actors who add a great deal of colour and authenticity to the action.""The Bank Job"" is directed and written in a style that brings tremendous clarity to a story that has many layers and the pace of the action is absolutely exhilarating. The time taken to introduce the bank robbers is well spent as it makes them interesting to watch and also puts the audience on their side.",The Bank Job
68,inspectors71,Everything I Like in a Movie,7,26 May 2016,"Roger Donaldson's sharp, suspenseful, and very human crime drama, based on, apparently, a true story of what some minor criminals find in the safety deposit boxes in a small bank, delivers what is critical for a heist movie to succeed:1. Everyone is a real, flesh and scars human 2. Violence is usually threatened and almost never graphic 3. Decency and degeneracy can walk hand in hand 4. If the good guys win, it's going to be at a terrible costI just saw another Donaldson picture a few months ago, The November Man. Remember how I appreciated the line delivered by Pierce Brosnan to his protégé, something like, ""You can either be a human or a taker of human life; you can't be both."" The November Man was a more standardized action flick, but the moral choice Brosnan's trainee has to make sends the quality of the movie up 1/2 dozen notches right away.In The Bank Job, Donaldson is able to convey the vulnerability felt by many of the primary and secondary characters. There's real fear on the faces of the guys at MI-5 (or is it MI-6; I never know). Jason Statham (who turns in a darn-good performance here) is torn between benefiting his family or destroying it. I don't know all the other actors, but everyone of them, as I said before, is so real, so smart, craven and foolish. The heart and soul of The Bank Job is in its ability to convince the audience that what they are seeing is plausible, maybe even real. When an up-and-coming spook spots a young woman he sent on an undercover mission in the Caribbean, covered in a shallow grave, he doesn't act tough. He forces back his emotions, and then orders the local authorities to burn the bad guy's house to the ground. If this guy can hang on to his career, he's going to be a holy terror in the British Intelligence community. Except for the usual problem of deciphering Statham's thickened and mumbling accent, and the less-than-a-clear-mix musical soundtrack for 1971, I found nothing to complain about here. If you find The Bank Job at your library, in a bin at Wal-Mart, or on Netflix, I would suggest you drop everything for the evening to watch a fine piece of restrained film-making. One of the message boarders commented that, if this had been made in the US, what made it so good would have died almost instantly. How true.",The Bank Job
69,antoniotierno,engaging,7,1 September 2008,"The script is based on a true story, so the details of the case are truly and genuinely charming. Acting (of most actors) is mostly OK, even though there's not so much depth to any of the characters - I'd have probably expected more details, being it a fact based story. Jason Statham is not the best actor on earth but is quite convincing as the lead (I would also say always convincing in these ""action"" roles). In short ""The bank Job"" is worth seeing due to many enjoyable moments and also because it sheds light on a fascinating true story. London location is very appropriate and suitable for this sort of story and everything of those years has been rendered properly.",The Bank Job

It's a well crafted crime thriller that's been executed in a realistic, suspenseful manner. Since there's Jason Statham in it, I did expect action but got very little of that. Not a problem since the plot is tight and the film is full of suspense. I couldn't almost believe it's a real story, until the end. This is one great heist thriller that features not just a great execution but also strong performances and art design that gives a perfect period feel to it. Won't say too much, other than that it's a very well written movie with some really good twists and turns that will keep you glued till the end. Also, be warned there's graphic nudity (almost), strong language, very less action, it's at times slow, and most importantly it's not for kids. Rest others, go watch it. It won't cost you much of your time as it's a little shorter than 2 hours.",The Bank Job
71,jaredmobarak,Knee-deep in fried chickenThe Bank Job,7,13 April 2008,"I think the fact that The Bank Job is based on a true story makes it more intriguing then it possibly should. As a whole, the film is pretty standard fare for the genre, a bunch of amateurs attempting a huge heist, government conspiracies behind it all, secrets at every turn, and of course the romantic angle of two lovers who can never be together. Really the fact that it is true shouldn't make a difference, but for some reason it does. Honestly, the plot of a bank heist to get compromising photos of a Royal might be the only thing true on screen, the rest might be pure Hollywood. Either way, it's a fun ride and worth watching if you enjoy a nice caper and can look past the usual problems that most filmmakers today ask you to.As an audience member, we are privy to three sides: the British end trying to keep all ties broken yet setting up an illegal operation to rob a safety deposit box; Michael X's end with other nefarious characters using blackmail to stay out of jail and corrupt cops to run the city of London; and the hapless crew of small-time criminals attempting a big score without knowing how big it actually is. I believe that Saffron Burrows is the true star of the film, playing all sides to make sure everything goes as planned. Her role has the biggest stake. She is blackmailed with freedom from drug charges to get a gang together, she is thrust back into the life of an unavailable childhood crush, and she must come to grips with the trouble she is hiding from those she cares about while the ones playing her watch it all happen from afar. Burrows handles it all very well and uses her looks to get what she wants from all parties involved.The most intriguing part of the film has to be the British intelligence scenes. Watching the deception and debauchery on display and the running around to hide it all because they thought it was safe is interesting. One would hope people in their positions would take precautions or maybe not partake in those activities at all, but then we are talking about politicians. While that portion caught my attention on a more intellectual level, seeing how the plans unfolded, the gang of robbers was what made me want to continue watching. This ragtag bunch is funny, endearing, and well performed by all the actors. They are good friends and have fun doing this seemingly safe job.Jason Statham is solid as always, leader of the crew, never allowing himself to be backed into a corner. He anticipates the fact that Burrows coming back after so long could be trouble and he makes sure to keep an eye on her activities. Even with that, though, he stays on task and plays the good family manwell as much as one can when you are in debt to larger criminals then yourself and partake in illegal activities whenever they present themselves. Also, no one does the cold stare of disgust like Statham when one of his friends does something stupidit is his trademark expression. The others add some nice flair too. Daniel Mays, who I enjoyed in a very small role last year with Atonement, is great comic relief and his interactions with the third of the friends, Stephen Campbell Moore, is always entertaining. James Faulkner is also a lot of fun as the con man front of the crime. Being so much older than the others, yet having the same sensibilities as them, hidden behind his play's exterior of a cultured gentleman, is great.My one real gripe overall is with the ending. Not the way it ends necessarily, but how all the characters go about their activities. You know what is coming from the get-go; there is no way it will all go without a hitch, where would the intrigue be with that? I like how it all played out, I liked all the double-crossings and deal makings, however, when the crap hits the proverbial fan, all involved seem to take it in stride way too easily. I mean people are dying, getting tortured, and risking arrest, yet all our ""heroes"" just act calm and collected as they plan a way to outsmart MI-6. Honestly, these guys should be shaking in their boots. But it is a film, and that attitude allows it to end nicely and quickly once the heist is complete, so I don't put too much stock into the misstep. The film still ends up being entertaining and, as a bit of historical escapism, succeeds.",The Bank Job
72,joebloggscity,"Another British heist movie; thrilling, nostalgic and intriguing addition to the genre",7,6 July 2008,"After Lock Stock was released around ten years ago, there was a revival in the British gangster genre. Sadly, most that followed were poor with the odd exception (i.e. Layer Cake). Now though, the Bank Job has been released and seems to have slipped through the cinema without being much noticed here in London. Nevertheless I managed to get to see it in the Cinema, and happy to have done so.The film is based in 1970's London and centres round a beautiful lady who cajoles an old friend (Jason Statham)to get a crew together to stage a bank raid to steal the contents of the deposit boxes held in the secure basement. The catch? Well, there's loads. There's govt and secret services involvement, a porn baron with criminal links, a militant black power activist on charges, corrupt policemen, and most difficult of all for the main lead is the inevitable wife and kids! Might all sound a bit overfed but it actually knits together quite well, and the script writer deserves a lot of credit for his work.Acting is generally quite good, with a superb job done by David Suchet as the Porn Baron. As for Jason Statham, well he played ""Jason Statham"" (surprise surprise!) however joking aside he does a grand job and his persona suited the role very well. Camera work and settings were very good, and as this was the 1970s, added credit should be given to the producers as it does well to give that whole feel of capturing the era.There are a few flaws (the bank job itself seemed much easier than I expected in some ways for such a small inexperienced crew), and it claims to be based on a true story in order to give it added gravitas. As much as I'm sure the crux of it is based on the actual real-life bank job, you just get the feeling that there is huge ""artistic license"" taken in all this. Nevertheless, truth can be stranger than fiction so who knows? Overall, I'd say you'd be hard pushed to find much better out in the cinema in the criminal/gangster genre at present. Its thrilling, enjoyable and at times tense. There are moments of humour in the movie, so its not all dark toned. I'd recommend it to anyone who is interested in the British gangster genre, and although it doesn't rate as highly as the classics, it is in my opinion a welcome addition.",The Bank Job
73,Maziun,Good robbery caper,7,11 August 2013,"This movie is not only great entertainment , but also a somewhat documentary based on real life events. It might be hard to believe , but the events that took place in movie ACTUALLY happened in real life. Few facts : * A big bank robbery did take place on Baker Street in 1971, culprits never found, money never recovered. * There was serious police corruption in London in the 1970s, cops on payrolls of drug dealers and pornographers. * Princess Margaret was involved in a series of affairs, some caught on compromising photos which were not published by the otherwise relentlessly sensational British press * There was a militant British black-power advocate, called Michael X, involved in a one-man, multi-country crime wave. The stories and characters might seem unconnected at first, but as the goes it all becomes very clear. It's old fashioned storytelling style but with very modern sensitivity. No unnecessary action set pieces , just good story and characters.The story is set in 1970's London. The 70's feel is brilliant - the great rock music, the depiction of the swinging sex scene in London, the perfect costumes , clothes and hairstyles. All spot on. The humor is subtle . The characters are likable and believable. Roger Donaldson (""No way out"") directs it with a lot of energy. Things moved along really well. This movie is full of intense action and great wit. All the emotions seem real.Jason Statham (""Snatch"") gives the best performance in his career . He never was more charming and charismatic than here. Saffron Burrows is HOT and creates a very interesting femme fatale . David Suchet (TV series ""Poirot"") is a frightening porn crime lord. Peter De Jersey is very scary as Michael X.

But it was a choice from our DVD rental provider and my wife and I thought it might be interesting. It proved to be excellent. In the Lionsgate tradition (amply demonstrated in previews of other Lionsgate films before the main event arrives), it contains a great deal of violence. However, the violence serves the plot, which is too complicated to describe here in great detail. Essentially it is an allegedly true story about a crime engineered by a British spy agency to retrieve some photographs stored in a London bank vault which show a member of the Royal Family engaged in a sex orgy on a Caribbean island. The small time criminals engaged to execute the break in are recruited by a woman who had been caught smuggling drugs into Britain and coerced into cooperating. The break in brings fatal consequences for some, though not all, of the gang members because several of the safety deposit boxes contain evidence implicating a couple of violent criminals and many members of the London police force. Interestingly, one of those violent criminals is played by David Suchet, who some viewers will recognize as ""Hercule Poirot"" in the many episodes of Agatha Christie stories that appear regularly on PBS. Of course, he's nothing like Poirot in the movie. But it's a reminder, if any is needed, that Suchet is an excellent actor and -- like many other Britons seen regularly on large and small screens -- extremely versatile.

The trouble with true stories is how much they're willing to simplify or how much they're going to go into the details to explain the whole thing without cheating with History. The Bank Job does a pretty good job of staying on the fine line: most is explained, little is really confusing except that making it simple, with all the bit and pieces of real facts in the way, doesn't make a convincing mixture.On the whole the small-time crooks crew is really too much a bunch of nice guys, too small for the job but managing to do well all the same.

Intriguing premise, right?Okay, the film starts out showing brief nude scenes which we later learn are what had been in said photographs. Then we learn of the conspiracy plot, and how the small-time crooks are found and lured in without their knowledge. There is also an irrelevant subplot about a black man having sex with a white woman, evidently as some sort of 1970's political statement. But then comes a scene where the crooks go to a strip club, then a brothel, and we see lots and lots of bare breasts and buttocks and the crooks get bound in leather and chains for S&M.We turned it off at that point. We were expecting a story about crime and conspiracy, but the movie clearly entered gratuitous sexuality territory. It's one thing to be suggestive and another to be outright pornographic. If you want a bank heist movie, there are plenty of infinitely better choices, and if you want porn, well, there's no shortage of that on the Internet.",The Bank Job

81,WriterDave,I'll Throw a Brick at You!,7,11 March 2008,"Sold to the American public as another D-level action pic staring Jason Statham, ""The Bank Job"" is actually a crafty British heist flick based on an incredible true story. The screenwriters deserve credit for creating a serviceable script with so many intertwining stories based on little actual evidence, conjecture, here-say, and conspiracy theories revolving around royal and political sex scandals, militant Caribbean drug lords, undercover MI5 agents, bumbling crooks, crooked cops, and double-crosses and cover-ups. It could've easily been a confusing mess, but providing the viewer pays attention, ""The Bank Job"" gets the job done as crackerjack entertainment.Though aptly directed by veteran Roger Donaldson, the film does suffer from an overly salacious opening ten minutes designed to grab the audience's attention, some shoddy editing, and an intrusively bad action-style music score. There's also an attention to 1970's period detail in the dialogue and clothes that comes across as caricature and adds an accidentally humorous undertone to the otherwise cold-as-ice affair. However, the details of the ""truth is stranger than fiction"" tale and the fun had by the ensemble cast make for a breezy way to spend a few hours.Donaldson also has an eye for the ladies. Led by a smashingly gorgeous Saffron Burrows (looking like a European version of Michelle Pfeiffer circa 1992), the powerful women depicted in ""The Bank Job"" are far more than just eye candy. Statham is also fairly good as the head of the bank robbing crew, and when he finally throws a brick at a guy near the end of the film, it will put a smile on any action fan's face.Things get tidied up a bit too nicely in the end, where it seems only the really villainous characters have to face justice, but before the credits role, there are a series of real-life epilogued details plastered on the screen that make the viewer realize maybe this all really did happen. Now that's a jolly good show.",The Bank Job
82,raypdaley182,Weird but good,6,16 April 2008,"""Based"" on a true story. I use the quotes as I'm not sure how thoroughly it's actually based on aforementioned true story. Statham plays Terry, (a small time villain who owns a car showroom) well enough, the girl playing Martine I think was 2nd choice for the role (I have the feeling Lena Heady turned it down) and needs to learn how to pronounce Marylebone correctly too.A mistake no Londoner would make. As their doing this job for MI5 (did MI6 even exist back then, they'd be an awfully new as a department wouldn't they?) off the record it's basically a black bag job.With bent coppers on the payroll, and brothel madams photographing high flying clients in case they need to do a bit of blackmail just about everyone is on the take in this film. Set in the 1970's they've researched well, hair & clothes are very accurate.For those curious when their planning the job? Yes, Glentworth Street did & still does run parallel to Baker Street. The debt that Terry (Statham) owes must be huge as the thugs took a brand new E-Type Jaguar (easily worth two grand even then!).It's a nice twisty plot with MI5 bosses asking a junior man to ask a girl he helped out of some drug problems to ask her slightly criminal friends to rob a vault. Simple really.Everything doesn't go to plan (they fall into a plague vault, they get overheard by a ham radio guy who phones the police) and Martine gets caught removing the contents of box 118 that MI5 wanted her to steal and it turns out its pictures of Princess Margaret having sex which is why MI5 wanted the job done in the 1st place, the robbery was just a cover for it to prevent a Royal scandal and blackmail by a group of Black Power supporters.The tension between Terry & Martine is picked up by the remainder of the gang and she has to explain herself when he reveals the photos. It turns out the photos were taken by a drug lord who runs the black power group (and is under surveillance by a female MI5 agent) but the gang also have a book containing all the payments made by a London Porn Baron (David Suchet) to bent coppers.Eventually Terry sets up meetings to get new passports and promises of immunity with Lord Mountbatten but there are scuffles and Terry & co get arrested but MI5 explain the situation and they get let free.Terry and his family leave England. There's also a brief explanation about the ""real"" robbery although details are sketchy and unlikely to be released until 2054.The film is OK as a robbery movie and stands up well, the subplots of corruption and who trusts who are very twisty indeed. It's well worth a look.",The Bank Job

84,beresfordjd,Astonishingly enjoyable,8,12 April 2016,"I have only seen one other Jason Statham movie and that was Lock Stock and two smoking Barrels. I do not remember him at all. I have always avoided his films because they look as thought they are stock(no pun intended) stupid action movies. However this was on TV so I recorded it to have a quick look. It has a great British cast of character actors and it is written by Clements and La Frenais which guarantees quality. Jason Statham is no Olivier but he carries his role well ably supported by reliable actors like Keeley Hawes, Daniel Mays, Saffron Burrows, Peter Bowles and others. There is hardly any wasted screen time in this gripping thriller, said to be based on actual events - if that is so then it is amazing indeed. It starts quite slowly and one is tempted to bin it for the first 15 minutes but then the seemingly unconnected threads begin to knit together and you just have to watch it. I will take the opportunity to check out Stathams other movies if they are half as good as this. It is great when one is surprised by the unexpected when you watch a film.",The Bank Job
85,danielmanson,I was pleasantly surprised by this,8,14 June 2020,"Ok then. I actually really enjoyed this film. Had some good action scenes and so on, but what was great was that this isn't a typical Statham movie at all.I will say that this film works with absolutely no prior knowledge of this true story, it works really well as a stand-alone story.
I thought the first half of the film was a lot better than the second and maybe dragged a little towards the back end of the film. But it's nothing major.
The film keeps you in suspense a lot, even after the robbery! It's just a good film and well worth watchingI recommend",The Bank Job
86,Shattered_Wake,S_W's Review of 'The Bank Job' (2008),8,15 March 2008,"After a brief stint in total crap, Jason Statham is back where he belongs: a bank vault. Based on a true story, 'The Bank Job' tells the story of police and government corruption, blackmail, murder, and robbery. What's not to love about that? After Michael X, the British version of Malcolm X, reveals he has incriminating photos of a certain member of the royalty, the MI5 or MI6 (I can never tell the difference) 'hires' a group of low-level hoodlums to rob the safety deposit box which contains the pictures. But the robbery is the easy part. It's the repercussions that create the best drama in the film.'The Bank Job' is a funny, sexy, and thrilling ride set for anyone who can dig it (see, the film's making me talk 70s already).Final Verdict: 8/10.",The Bank Job
87,diane-34,The way these movies should be made but aren't.,10,16 August 2008,"Diane and I watched this marvelous movie several days ago on the recommendation of a friend and we were far from disappointed; the movie was a cracker and we both indulged ourselves in a crime movie with out the accompanying Hollywood histrionics of car chases, crashes, fistfights and assorted bloody mayhem to entertain the folks in the Heartlands.Because the story was true and the details of the case even 37 years after the fact are still officially masked, the whole viewing experience is extremely powerful. The movie is of course plot-driven and what a plot it is. It must be hugely difficult for the actors in such a movie because they know, regardless of how well they conduct their acting tasks, the audience will be absorbed in the script and the""what happens next syndrome."" However, all the actors in hindsight, did not interject one (at least for me) discernible misstep in their collective performances.The sum total is a movie of sublime excellence that only the British seem to be able to carry off so well. It is in this respect an old fashioned movie, meant only in superlative terms. It is a movie to be savoured in all respects.",The Bank Job

She tells an old scheming friend of hers, Terry (Jason Statham), about this golden opportunity and before long he has gathered a team who can get into the bank and make a raid. Little does he know that he's being set-up purely so Martine can get the invaluable photos and consequently be released from a drugs charge from the Government. The Government is being blackmailed because of the photos and wants to get them back so they can destroy them. A simple job soon becomes extremely complicated and dangerous. Will Terry get busted? Will the royal family be shamed? Will Martine walk free? See it to find out.A well put together movie, with plenty of twists and turns.

Instead what he does indirectly effects everybody else. And because of that, everybody is trying to stop him.So Statham and Burrows work together to try to get out the mess she created.

The Bank Job although has its moments which make it kind of like a Jason Statham/Brit flick it is different in the sense where it reflect the seriousness of the situation they had gotten themselves into.

Little does he know that agents of the State are only using him for their own purposes. There are the usual scenes for heist movies where we are introduced to the gang members and a comic touch to some of the scenes as it clear that the gang may be out of their depth.

Set in the 70s and based on a true story of an extraordinary bank heist, it would be understandable if snazzy gizmos and high-tech effects are absent, but the execution could use a lot of help.Martine (Saffron Burrows) is an ex-model who hires her ex Terry (Jason Statham) to rob a bank. Despite having already turned over a new leaf complete with a wife and kid, Terry accepts. He and his team push through with their plan, only they uncover not just material wealth but blackmail-worthy bits of damning evidence as well.There is no charisma between the main characters, between the purported exes and within the thieving team.

We kept watching hoping that the rest of the film might make up for the scenes. The weak plot and non-descript dialogue did not make up for all the continuing COMPLETELY GRATUITOUS shots of naked women in the film. Highly suggest avoiding.

102,joemamaohio,My Review,7,11 July 2008,"Based on the true story of a daring bank robbery at London's Lloyd's Bank in 1971, ""The Bank Job"" focuses on young rogue Terry Leather (Jason Statham), as he agrees to do a bank job with the cohesion of mysterious Martine Love (Saffron Burrows). Even though they've never robbed a bank before, Terry and his friends orchestrate an elaborate plan to dig under the bank and get inside the vault from the inside.This is the basic premise of the film, but what makes this film so great is the several underlying subplots that keeps the viewer entranced. Martine is working with an organization to retrieve photos taken by radical Michael X, whom they've been trying to arrest but can't because he's blackmailing them with these pictures. There's also a safe deposit box belonging to a local madam with incriminating photos of some of the highest officials in government, as well as another box with a list of corrupt cops that a seedy strip club owner wants back.With all these underlying, overlapping story arcs, ""The Bank Job"" is more than just your typical bank robbery movie, and that's what makes it so fantastic. You never know who's on the good side, and who will prevail (if anyone). And Statham is totally in his element which clearly shows in his flawless performance. Sure, there's a lot of mistakes (mostly due to the fact that it takes place in the early 70s but a lot of the exterior is modern-day), but it's still a very well-done picture.",The Bank Job
103,seawalker,Takes too long to get going,6,10 March 2008,"In it's own small way ""The Bank Job"" attempts the same trick that the writer James Ellroy pulled off so well in his fine novels ""American Tabloid"" and ""The Cold Six Thousand"". That is, to weave a connected narrative from matters of public record (the Baker Street Walkie-Talkie heist and subsequent D-Notice, the disgrace of certain Conservative government ministers due to sex scandals and the fall of the criminal Michael X) and public rumour (the indiscretions of Princess Margaret, the involvement of Lord Louis Mountbatten in British intelligence operations and the true extent of police corruption and involvement with certain London based porn barons of the early seventies). It works, kind of. The problem with ""The Bank Job"" is that it takes too long to get going.During the first half of ""The Bank Job"" there is a definite whiff of seen-it-all-before ennui. The job is instigated, the team is assembled, the job is pulled. Pretty unrealistic, so-so, anaemic stuff, frankly, with variable acting. (Whoever told Saffron Burrows that she can do 'cockney'?)Then suddenly, during the second half, writers Dick Clement and Ian La Frenais rediscover the form they had when they wrote the brilliant early 70's Richard Burton vehicle ""Villain"", and ""The Bank Job"" becomes really entertaining, gritty, seedy, violent, fast moving and complex. Shame it wasn't like that from the start.Nice, slightly out of character performance by Jason Statham, who only has one real 'hardman' moment. Fun, extended cameos from a galaxy of jobbing British character actors. Peter Bowles, Keeley Hawes and David Suchet, amongst others. See if you can spot Colin Salmon. I didn't even realise he was in the movie until I read the credits.In retrospect, probably a missed opportunity, and it should have been better, but ""The Bank Job"" is still worth seeing if you have the patience to stick with it. It does get better as it goes along.",The Bank Job

Most of 'The Bank Job' is true, some highly fictionalised but it's none the better or worse for that! In fact, take it at face value and you'll have a wonderful time with it. It evokes 70's London fabulously, the music and fashion being a highlight of the movie. The script sparkles and the action, once it gets going, moves at a cracking pace.

106,nturner,"Sit Back, Relax, Enjoy",8,7 November 2008,"Jason Statham is a macho guy. He's got enough testosterone to sink a battleship and probably has to change blades in the middle of a shave. In most of his films he plays an over-the-top role as a hero involved in unbelievable action from the beginning to the end of the film. He is very good in those roles, and I must admit that I enjoy those action flicks. The Bank Job is somewhat a change of pace for Statham. It has its fair share of action, but the action is not exaggerated. There is far more subtlety here than in most of his other films.The tagline of the film is ""Based Upon a True Story"" but don't think that this is an truly accurate depiction of the actual crime. In reality, the film uses three events of the early 70's amalgamated into a fast moving crime thriller.There really was a bank robbery in 1971 London at a bank on Baker Street just a few blocks from the fictional home of Sherlock Holmes. The thieves tunneled under a connection shop and blasted their way into the vault where they rifled the safety deposit boxes. It was reported that they got away with some five-hundred-thousand pounds of booty but the actual amount may have been much more considering many of the box holders did not disclose the contents of the boxes.Also active in 1970's England was a radical known as Michael X who was basically the English version of Malcolm X. He was a darling of such supporters as John Lennon.The Royals in the 70's were having a very good time - especially Princess Margaret. She had a scandalous affair with a much younger man that eventually led to her divorce - keeping in mind that her husband was surely no saint.The authors of the screenplay have skillfully combined these three elements into a nice, tight little crime caper thriller that holds your attention from beginning to end. Terry (Statham) is approached by long-time friend Martine (Saffron Burrows) with a scheme to rob a bank. Terry - who doesn't always travel on the side of the law - agrees in order to find the money to keep his exotic car business going. He gathers together a group of acquaintances with whom he has worked in the past. The plan is to rent a vacant shop near the bank, tunnel under the vault, and break in through the floor. It seems that Martine has found out that the vibration alarms have been turned off for a short period of time.What Terry doesn't know is that Martine is working as a front for MI-5 and that the true objective of the theft is to retrieve some compromising photographs of Princess Margaret. Throw in photographs and films of high government officials in sex acts stored in the vault by a high class madame and an account book of a major porn producer who is paying off the cops and is in business with Michael X in human trafficking and you have a room of safety deposit boxes filled with riches and the seeds of disaster for a large number of government officials.All of the acting and the actors in this film are restrained and believable. Stratham does a great job as one time bad boy who has settled down with a wife and kids and only ventures into the theft in order to maintain his lifestyle. His companions come across as just regular guys who don't mind a bit of larceny. Saffron Burrows is absolutely beautiful. She is a former model and plays a former model in the film. But she isn't there just for window dressing as she certainly holds her own with her male counterparts.The Bank Job is good, solid entertainment. It doesn't challenge, but that doesn't matter because it enables you to just sit back, relax and enjoy.",The Bank Job

When I started hearing good things about this movie I thought to myself I will see it. I saw it because I got in free since I work at a movie theater. This movie delivered some funny, intense action scenes. I didn't like that their wasn't a lot of action though. If you are going into this movie expecting a ton of action their is pretty much none at all. One thing bad or good about this movie was that it wasn't just about a bank job. In the bank they were robbing they had special things in one of the safety boxes. I don't want to spoil it though so I will stop. In The Bank Job some of the thiefs get a second chance to restart their lives, and others they don't. One fact good about this movie is that it's based on a true story. Most of the time whenever movies are based on a true story or true events it's a good movie. This isn't going to win any awards or anything like that. This also won't be a high budget film. The acting was very good in this between all of the characters. This movie also explains everything very well. They don't leave anything open or missing at the end.

109,simonparker1990,Slow beginning but brilliant pay off,8,12 February 2008,"I'll be honest, I only saw The Bank Job because I had some free tickets for an advance screening, had I have not got these tickets I would not have bothered seeing it. The only trailer I had saw for it just didn't really appeal to me, I do enjoy Jason Statham movies, but this one seemed a bit serious in my eyes. Still I went today to the 6.30 screening and was surprised to enjoy it quite as much as I did. Admittedly for the first half hour I did get quite bored, the characters weren't really memorable and the set up seemed really dull. Thankfully when the heist gets under way, and especially the aftermath, the movie hits top gear and left me thrilled. The fact the movie is based on a true story still leaves me quite amazed, as the events that happen seem purely like the stuff that you see in the movies. How much of it is real and how much of it is purely to make it a better movie, a fight involving Statham I am certain didn't happen. The performances are surprisingly well rounded, Statham doing a brilliant job and the majority of the supporting cast getting some great scenes. Alas the movie does start to fall apart under close inspection, the plot is never concluded quite as well as I would have liked, and the movie does have some long stretches where not a lot is happening. If you can overlook this fact then you will a lot to enjoy in this very well made movie.So onto the performances. As I have said Statham does a surprisingly admirable job in the film. When you look at his CV of films you realise he isn't exactly the most talented actor. In fact all he generally has to do is grumble and hit things a lot. But there is just no denying that the man has a hell of a lot of charisma, in this film he truly gets to display his acting skills. Of course on occasion he delivers a dodgy line, but then if you watch some of the smaller scenes with his characters wife you realise how much potential he has. If given the right material I am sure Statham can truly develop as an actor. Saffron Burrows is brilliant as the slightly suspicious Martine for the first half, unfortunately after the heist she has little to do and the character never felt fully concluded. Still she does have some great moments in the earlier part of the film. Daniel Mays runs off with the majority of the movie as Dave, in fact this looks set to launch Mays career a bit further, he has the best lines and is a funny character. Richard Lintern (who I have to confess I thought was Dougray Scott for half the film) is brilliant as the man behind the heist, in some way that is, and his character is one of the most rounded. Peter De Jersey as Michael X is menacing in his all too brief screen time, but like Martine his character never felt fully dealt with. Still he and the other chief villain, David Suchet, are quite menacing.The Bank Job when advertised does come across as a typical gangster flick with a lot of humour in it. However when watching it I have to be honest and say it isn't that funny. There are a couple of lines here and there but the movie doesn't really make you laugh that much. Neither is it that big of a gangster flick, of course there are the local gangster running around, and the movie becomes more along that line towards the end. But for the majority of the film it comes across as a slightly grittier and far less flashy Ocean's Eleven. The scenes where they try to rob the bank are definitely some of the highlights, however its the final 45 minutes that stick firmly in mind. What happens after the robbery is just thrilling to watch, will they get away with it, won't they? Things also get a lot darker near the end, also quite violent one scene, or the idea of what was going to happen, made me wince a bit. The film is superbly directed as well, its not too flashy but there are some great shots in there. Unfortunately the music does start to irritate after a while, everything seems overdone, a scene which is meant to be funny is ruined because the music sounds like its from an action movie, it just doesn't truly suit the film all the time. Also as previously mentioned the beginning as well is quite boring.Overall The Bank Job is a great movie that with a bit of fine tuning at the beginning could make it even better. If you want a smart thriller that will surprise you because of it being based on real events that I highly recommend this. Don't expect an all time classic though.",The Bank Job

111,beregic,loved it and will be watching it again in the future! great plot,9,26 April 2008,"i highly recommend it to anyone into high quality heist plots both from realistic( quiet historic even in this case) as well as artistic ones. many first screener ""daily"" reviews has been categorizing it as average, while this is anything BUT your standard robbery movie( it DOES employ ""classic"" takes in plot substance ONLY). this is something that is very well acted, directed and especially gives the most REALISTIC take on the greatest( as amount taken) UNSOLVED robbery ever. i am going to speculate that the first 20 minutes must been the culprit(for those negative reviews) where the movie takes its time in constructing the characters which are MANY. typically the main complaint would be that of under-developed characters; well this one has them over-developed, and after seeing it all you will understand that for good reasons.for people that loves suspense this is just perfect. i must make a note here; not the general Hollywood one based on shocking the viewer, or by being ""stylish"" like ""ocean 11,12,13"" , but by REAL LOGICAL consistency. the movie's elements come great together , that in the end you will not care much about being ""surprised"" with some likely dumb twist, but you might, just as me, care about how the things will turn out for each and every character involved. no things blown up here, almost no violence at all( but the ones existing are very brutal in concept). it is not a ""mob"" movie, no cheesy lines or tony Montana type. here you have an excellent combination of old school suspense technique, with very realistic elements on top of which you also have a focused direction that implements well the newest filming advancements and ""tricks"". basically do not buy into the typical Hollywood commercial and ""promises"" here, that is the only way i could see anyone having a ""let down"" for this one. also the very young viewers will likely and simply not understand it, at least not completely as it should be.the greatest robbery of London has created many conspiracy theories, and this whole production mirrors the well know and most accepted one.while not proved, the FACTS are absolutely correct( read the reviewer next to me for excellent details). i do have a problem with this that i did not like; while one of the main ""bad"" characters was apparently indeed black, the movie has a certain racist undertone and i would argue that they are unnecessary rants from both sides. but the ones coming from ""mi5"" and ""mi6"" characters, i found them disturbing a lot regardless of their importance to the plot.this is the only reason i give the feature 9 stars and not 10.the whole action plot has got me so involved into it that i completely forgot of Jason Statham as the most respected ""fighter"" on screen this days. (without giving spoilers away i am sure you will not get disappointed at that chapter either, comes at an unexpected moment and perfect timing and delivers enough to enhance the plot, not undermine it.) the supporting actors are GREAT( i did not see any flaws that some reviewers mentioned but then again i am not an ""art"" observer, thanks God)).most, if not all , are British, and again i can not help but notice the superiority of British cinema to that of Hollywood( or the new kid in town, bollywood). no i am not British nor English first language speaker( as you easily notice from my not so good writing skills).before i end i must add as well that this movie has had delivered yet another excellent social-political message with practical application. lets just say that it brings to the spotlight e the ""princess Diana's"" case yet again, even if in theory there are no historical relations in-between the two ""cases"". for once, i was fully on the robbers ""side""( generally they create sympathy only but not here) while watching, and i send ""thanks!"" to Mr. Roger Donaldson wonderful direction of giving it to me ""straight"".enjoy!",The Bank Job
112,tanelteder,following Guy's path,8,30 May 2011,"I can honestly say, this movie is worth seeing. I like British stuff, especially if its good British stuff. The Bank Job that is. I must admit, I didn't love it as much as Guy Ritchie's two famous cult movies, but I really liked it still though. There are some truly intense scenes mixed with a brilliant British slang. I think the screenplay was very original and well written. There were many open ropes and that is the basic of an interesting movie. So it's my recommendation.We all know Jason Statham and what he is capable of. He doesn't disappoint here as well. Perfect for the role and he has some fantastic supporting actresses too.I haven't seen such a story told before in a movie. Maybe only read in Mickey Mouse comics book where The Beagle Boys were thinking about pulling off such an idea.",The Bank Job
113,J_Trex,Excellent Crime Caper Movie!,9,10 March 2008,"The reviews were generally good for this and the film did not disappoint. The setting is England in the early 70's and the Director did a nice job of re-creating the era. The clothes, language, music, etc. evoked the time and mood perfectly. The cast was largely unknown to me, except for Jason Statham, yet they were all outstanding in their roles. The dialog was sharp and fast moving. Statham in particular did very well in this role. It certainly makes a difference having a great script to work with. The plot was full of intrigue and twists. There was plenty of action, drama, witty dialog, government malfeasance at the highest levels, violence, the whole nine yards.The main plot involves the heist crew being unknowingly setup by MI5 (England's FBI) to break into a bank vault, using the bank robbery as a ruse, to retrieve blackmail documents involving top government officials. The documents belong to shady mob characters, who want the documents back, as does MI5. High drama ensues as the mob and MI5 close in on the heist crew.Some viewers might find the plot development slow moving toward the beginning, but I believe it more than compensates later in the film. The last 45 minutes were as good an ending as I've seen in a crime drama in years. I would definitely recommend this film.",The Bank Job
114,pmdawn,Your average Statham movie.,6,10 April 2008,"This movie had a lot going for it. Based on a true and legendary heist. Early 1970s style. Jason Statham.I won't lie, this movie entertained me. It was a fun flick. But it managed, somehow, to be unbelievable. And this is allegedly based on true events. The subplots are vague and uninteresting and the ""seventies"" style is not well-explored (sometimes even made irrelevant). The good cast and the main interactions between the ""robbers"" is what saves the movie in my opinion.This could have been anything from ""Layer Cake"" and ""Lock, Stock..."" to ""The Italian Job"" and ""Revolver"". However, it is inferior to all of those because it is ultimately unsatisfying and tries to mix too many ingredients at once, but it never gets too exciting for the viewer. There's some humour in the film, which helps, but at the end I was left frustrated. Another director, another script... things could've been different.I'm a big fan of Jason Statham, but he needs to choose his roles more carefully. This movie could have been really good, but because of the pragmatic and ultimately boring way it is told, somehow it turns out to be just another heist movie when it should have been the greatest of them all.",The Bank Job
115,patlightfoot,Most entertaining film yet,9,28 December 2008,"I watched this DVD back to back twice. I loved it. Then watched again when my family showed it on Christmas Day. And as a student of film studies (BA actually at UNE with a minor in Communications) I thought it was great. I rarely do that but some movies do have that reaction with me. However, watching the special features segment, was a bit amused that it wasn't totally true as it was advertised to be.But like 'Snatch' or 'Saving Grace' 'Greenfingers' those low budget British movies seemed to catch the viewers attention, and like me, loved it. We forget, it's ENTERTAINMENT FIRST.I hope that others also appreciate that the London scene during this period was dominated by some rather nasty people like the Kray Twins, and this was in someways after the great train robbery was a bigger heist. Accomplished by lesser crims. That's what was so amusing about the whole theme!",The Bank Job
116,janos451,Improbable Reality,8,7 March 2008,"If ""The Bank Job"" were fiction, it would be a fairly decent robbery caper. As it is, ""The Bank Job,"" a veritable documentary and realistic whodunit, is awesome. Unlike most films, this one requires a couple of advance tips: First, watch it with the improbable idea in mind that most of it is actual, hard-to-believe truth; second, don't be impatient. As the story of a 1971 bank robbery begins, the setting in London, the parade of seemingly unconnected stories and characters is rather confusing, complex, disjointed. But stay with it - there is a crescendo of excitement and excellence. The true elements of ""The Bank Job,"" some hidden until recently by Britain's ""D Notice"" censorship law (modified in 1993, becoming DA, or Defense Advisory) are these:1. A big bank robbery did take place on Baker Street in 1971, culprits never found, money never recovered. After initial big headlines, the story disappeared from the newspapers. 2. There was serious police corruption in London in the 1970s, cops on payrolls of drug dealers and pornographers.3. Princess Margaret was involved in a series of affairs, some caught on compromising photos which were not published by the otherwise relentlessly sensational British press, under the D-Notice rule. 4. There was a militant British black-power advocate, called Michael X, involved in a one-man, multi-country crime wave. (In 1971, John Lennon paid for Michael X's bail, something not mentioned in the film.)""The Bank Job"" director Roger Donaldson (of ""No Way Out"") brings together all these true threads in a way that may be true even in its totality, director and cast prevailing over some shoddy work from too many writers. The content is all true, the context is excitingly possible. Did the government, in trying to prevent exposure of Princess Margaret by evidence in Michael X's possession, mastermind the bank robbery? Was MI-5 or MI-6 (says a policeman in the film: ""I never remember which is which"") involved, and actually assisting the robbers? Again, possibly. The cast is remarkable: Jason Statham is the ringleader, the bad guy of ""Transporter"" and ""The Italian Job"" turning into a scourge of the really bad guys. Saffron Burrows, James Spader's vamp nemesis on ""Boston Legal,"" brings her remarkable name and looks to the criminally and emotionally ambiguous major female role.Peter De Jersey is a totally scary Michael X; David (""Poirot"") Suchet is a frightening crime lord; and a whole host of top British stage actors fill in big roles and small ones. Don't be misled by reviews speaking of a so-so thriller - ""The Bank Job"" is a great deal more than that, even to the point that you may want to see it more than once.",The Bank Job
117,catchuanbu,Good movie,7,14 January 2020,"""The bank job"" was the great suprise of this week, with a good story based on true events. This is a well made film set in the 70s with some great actors and some even greater classic vehicles. I did expect action but got very little of that. Not a problem since the plot is tight and the film is full of suspense. I couldn't almost believe it's a real story, until the end.The movie keeps a good pace and never takes it so seriously. It build up the plot lines and tries somewhat successful to tie everything together. There is some good tension, about violence( not much) and eventually, vindication for most of the parties.Loved the movie...again based on true story involving royal family photos.",The Bank Job
118,KingBrian1,A Descent Bank Heist movie,7,16 December 2014,"British Bank heist movie. The English are good at making these sorts of movies. The use of actors and actresses who are British or English is an asset to the film. Their dialects, lingo colloquial made it authentic and believable. Decent film about events in 70's Britain. I have doubts about truth as a lot of the film seems more about generating atmosphere about what life was like back then. The one problem with this film is does it pass the truth test in the process of making it. A lot was fictionalized to make it a good movie. I for one like the whole drilling under the buildings to get into the bank and the behaviour of the police. Other aspects I find difficult to believe ever happened. Still like it though.",The Bank Job
119,Len9876,Jason Statham is 'hot'!,9,27 July 2008,"""The Bank Job"" (2008), even if fictionalized, is so real that is scary and shocking. The tension mounts, then the action suddenly slows, and I found myself grasping for the twists and turns. They are definitely worth waiting for because the excitement escalates to a high of 10. Even though this film has not been highly promoted, do not think that this is an average whodunit. It is not. This film is absolutely superb!The theme is political corruption, and involves true-to-life events, going way beyond just a London bank robbery. This is a film that you will want to see more than once, as it pulls you into what may seem to be unconnected stories that have nothing to do with one another. But, they do. There is a crescendo of chaos which, at times, is difficult to bear. There is mayhem, murder, mystery, intrigue, and suspense. I found myself holding onto the edge of my seat, right up to the surprise ending. Some of the true-to-life events, which were included in an IMDb.com review, might make this film even more exciting for you:1. A big bank robbery did take place on Baker Street in 1971, culprits never found, money never recovered. After initial big headlines, the story disappeared from the newspapers. 2. There was serious police corruption in London in the 1970s, cops on payrolls of drug dealers and pornographers.3.

The content is true, and the context is possible. Did the government, in trying to prevent exposure of Princess Margaret (by evidence in Michael X's possession), mastermind the bank robbery? Was MI-5 or MI-6 involved, and assisting the robbers? The affirmative is quite possible.The entire cast is superb. Jason Statham is 'hot' as the ringleader in this film, and as the 'bad guy' of ""Transporter"" and ""The Italian Job."" He exceptionally portrays a scourge of 'really bad guys'. Saffron Burrows, James Spader's vamp nemesis on ""Boston Legal,"" brings her remarkable performance, looks, and body to her presence, as one of the principal criminals. She appears to be the beauty and the brains, behind the virility and the brawn. And, this promises to be only the beginning, of long and distinguished careers, for both Jason Statham and Saffron Burrows.Peter De Jersey plays a frightening Michael X. David (""Poirot"") Suchet is a scary crime lord. This, in addition to the brilliance of the entire cast, makes this film an exceptional thriller. I rate this film a 9 out of 10.

120,HBeachBabe,just another day on the (Bank) Job,6,14 April 2008,"There's an old screen writing adage that all story telling can be boiled down to: Put your main character in a tree, then throw rocks at him, then get him out of the tree. On those terms, a caper film is already tailor-made since the heroes are crooks thus they have ready-made antagonists in the authorities/police/government trying to stop them.The Bank Job does a nice job of setting up a number of different plot lines leading to our heroes getting in a tree (breaking into a bank vault). The problem then comes that we are waiting for the rocks to start hurling in, but they never come. Sure there are some setbacks and tense moments, but overall, the heroes/crooks are rarely in much jeopardy - certainly never enough for us as an audience to think that they won't succeed at the heist and the getaway, even when the getaway gets complicated. Films like this thrive on tension and while the heist and the exit plan are entertaining, they are rarely tense.The film also suffers from a lack of third act twists. Everything that happens is very straight forward and set up in previous scenes. There are no big reveals, no stunning reversals. I'm not saying a film has to have an ""I see dead people"" moment, but a heist thriller needs to have some twists and on that count, The Bank Job comes in low.I enjoyed the film for what it was, but couldn't help thinking it should have been so much better.",The Bank Job
121,filmsploitation,Solid if unoriginal!,6,18 May 2008,"British and crime thriller goes together as well as Brighton seafront and slightly ropey seafood. And ropey would be a good word to describe the recent Brit crime films  Revolver, Played and many other crimes against a once great genre that spawned Get Carter & Snatch. So when journeyman director-for-hire Roger Donaldson, he of Species and Dante's Peak fame, teamed up Jason Statham (one of the hardest working Brits out there at the moment) as much as I knew I'd watch the film my hopes weren't exactly high. It's a relief then that, for the most part, we get a solid three star movie that does very much what it says on the tin. Offered a job to rob what seems like an easy to hit bank, Terry (Statham) and his crew of petty crooks get embroiled in a deadly plot to cover up a scandal that could rock the foundation of the British monarchy bringing them face to face with spooks, bent coppers and crooks with lethal consequences. Apparently based on the true story of the 'Walkie Talkie bank robbers', Donaldson's film ticks most of the boxes you expect from a modern day British crime thriller, not least the inclusion of Jason Statham who makes his fourth appearance in a genre (Lock, Stock, Snatch, Revolver) that he is becoming somewhat of a mainstay of/typecast in (delete as appropriate). Sweary, violent and with a swerve ending its very much film-making by numbers here. But then again Donaldson has never been a director who stamps his originality on proceedings. This is especially clear when judging the confusing first thirty minutes of the film where you never quite sure who is who or even who is screwing who. A better director might have made this sparkly and fun, but in Donaldson's hands it's just plodding and dull. However the later hour of the films running time is where it starts to come together and with the bank job well underway the film's characters, story and motivations seem to gel much better. It's here the film finally lives up to it's snappy trailer It's fair to say that this is a film that belongs to its lead and even though Jason Statham is very much playing the Jason Statham we know and love that isn't such a bad thing  his charisma and charm light up the screen yet again, lifting the not so great moments. It's fair to say that without him would probably have been a much duller film. As for the other cast, David Sucher is the best of the rest as porn baron Lew Vogal and Craig Fairbrass turns in another one of his familiar hard as nails performances but Keeley Hawes is wasted as Terry's wife and Saffron Burrows delivers yet another performance phoned in from the comfort of her own home. Whilst never reaching the heights of films like Get Carter, Snatch or a multitude of other Brit gangster/crime films that come before it, there's a lot to enjoy in The Bank Job and if you can get past the first, uncomfortably weak half an hour there's a good movie ready to entertain you. Just don't expect anything overly original.If you liked this try: Snatch, Oceans 11",The Bank Job

It's a type of movie where lots of directors don't even try or fail to catch that change of pace, the speeding up, and make it successfully, but an experience director like Donaldson, knows how to slowly build tension and drama till explodes in the end, connecting all dots, and on top of everything the characters are developed and breed even though the film is breathless.",The Bank Job

126,ashi-lance,The Bank Job '08,8,27 August 2013,"It's a British crime thriller starring Jason Statham. It cleverly weaves together a number of real- life events in 1971 into a ""this might be what happened scenario"" involving a bank robbery that happened at The Baker Street in Central London, the details of which never came to light. The movie started off strangely and almost lost me. The opening scenes were of someone secretly taking pictures of a sexual romp and I thought for a moment whether it is some kind of a porn –flick and I had the wrong movie. West Indian crime lord Bombass (Alki David) takes compromising photos of a high profile royal figure on holiday in the Caribbean and secures them in a top secret bank vault to be used for extortion means at any time, whilst establishing his own crime empire. MI5 get wind of this and assign sexy Agent Martine Love (Saffron Burrows) to get them those photographs and she approaches Terry Leather (Jason Statham), a car agent and his mates which lead them to a daring and complex break in to the bank's vault to retrieve cash and valuables for themselves for a secure future & clearing off their debts and bring photos for MI5 (about which Love never tells to Terry), a commitment that Love has to keep in order to stay out of the crime (possession of Drugs) that she has committed for which she was caught by MI at an Airport The first half of the movie is the heist, the second half is what happens afterwards when our gang is at the mercy of the British establishment and also the underworld figures who want back sensitive items which have disappeared from their rifled safety deposit boxes. Plus, the surprising elements of corruption that are very much alive in the British System of Bureaucracy comes to light. The best part is that the pace and thrill of the movie holds you back at the edge of your seat and result is a thrilling action flick where Jason Stathom stands out.MY RATING: 8/10",The Bank Job
127,bloodymonday,Review: The Bank Job,6,10 October 2008,"A classic caper film is like going to see an orchestra. Even though you are already know what you are going to experience on that evening, but you're still able to be amazed by how well prepare they were. The Bank Job is a caper film alright. But calling a classic one might be out of reach. Although what you saw in the first half is very entertaining piece of storytelling, but I can't really say the same thing on the second half. It's a frustration that caused by various factors (more on that later). In the end, it just really left me out cold.Formerly known as Baker Street (hands down, far more superior title), The Bank Job follows the true story of crime of the century (as they claim) in 70's era London, England, where a bunch of criminal (led by Jason Statham and Saffron Burrows) dug tunnel into the bank's vault, and then looted all the jewel & cash including items in client's safe-deposit box. A little did they know, there's a bunch of people who desperately need to retrieve those items back including secret photos of disgraced Britain's royal family, serious consequence ensured.From a starting point to procedure of the caper, I feel really engaged by it. The atmosphere is just simply perfect. They indeed have a right look and mood to that era. In fact, it reminds me of another classic caper film like Rififi. They also have a right leading man; Jason Statham is back to his British's groove once again (as a 'straight guy' in Guy Richie's films). And I don't know that his research is having watched all Steve Mcqueen's films or not, but his persona is really like the man himself. They also cleverly introduced a bunch of characters through inter cut that promise you that they will somehow relate to each other in the end. For me, it's like watching Guy Ritchie's Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels all over again But after they got away with the crime, suddenly everything that works somehow stopped. I would say a sloppy directing and editing are the main reason behind it. The consequence that affected team members is simply generic. How generic? Let's see, good guys succeed, and then a casualty occurred (of course, some of them dead), and finally it's a payback time. It may be alright if they ran it with a groove that they found in the first half. But all of that didn't have a same energy like they did 30 minutes ago at all. And those sub-plots (about porn king's book and drug lord's photos) are badly executed. The emotion also shifted with no apparent reason. Like characters seem really desperate in this scene, and then they're back to extra cool in the next scene. Come to think of it, in the end, when Jason's partner in crime asked him why police were letting them go, Jason said ""How the f**k should I know, just keep walking"". I think this sentence is like the joke on itself.Anyway, as I said before, everything else in this film are more than fine. The look and sound are cool enough to make us feel attached to that era (especially how they chose songs to play in it). In my opinion, good caper film is a rare breed nowadays (if you wanna call Steven Soderbergh & his pal's Ocean Trilogy as 'Caper film', then be my guess, because I prefer to call it as 'Vanity Project'). The Bank Job is the closest thing you can find, and having a right to call themselves as caper film.",The Bank Job

In fact, there is no intelligent character depicted in this entire movie.If this really represents true people who committed a 'daring robbery', then those who could not catch these idiots must be the most inept imaginable.The acting, such as it is, is little more than caracitures and meremly saying the lines from a script with no depth, no nuance, no personality.

130,daveygandthekeyboard,Better than your average caper film,9,24 July 2008,"Based on true events, this is a tightly plotted and paced movie that starts off feeling like a caper film, then ends up as something else. The story is about a gang of second rate crooks who become patsies for a government operation, hired to break into a bank that holds some incriminating photos of some people in Parliament. They tunnel under the vault, break in and spend the night ransacking its contents, only to be overheard by a ham radio operator who calls the policewho at first don't even believe him. It is the incompetence of the thieves and then the surprising outcome of the heist that set this apart from other such films, giving the events a weight that would otherwise not be possible. Jason Statham does his thing, kicking ass when he has to. This is a very enjoyable film.",The Bank Job
131,belindar-2,Excellent Film,9,4 December 2015,"This is one of Jason Statham's best films. When watching this film, you will really enjoy it. There was not a dull moment from start to finish. Staham is highly underrated and should be in the top ten of male actors. The fact that the movie was based on factual events makes it the more enjoyable. After watching this movie you will want to go back and follow his career movies and wonder why he has not received more credit for being such a great actor. Put this in your movies to watch at least once a year and you will really enjoy it each time. The British really know how to make moving pictures, in my opinion they really out rank the American ones, and I am an American.",The Bank Job
132,grenmonkey,The whole film just seems wanting to be something much more than it really is...,2,26 May 2009,"When it reads ""based on actual events"" on the title of the movie, ""great film"" aren't the first two words you'd think about. Boasting on a fact that something vaguely similar to the events of the film might have happened in real life isn't the most convincing sales-speech to any story. All it does is make it sound like the filmmakers are working on an excuse for a poor script.The Bank Job is just that. It's sad because I happen to like Jason Statham (the leading man of the film), I believe he's the action hero of the 21st century, above all the Vin's and Rock's the world has to offer nowadays. He just feels too misplaced in this film and the one scene we get to see Jason in his element jumps out too much from rest of the film and makes the whole scene feel as misplaced as poor Jason himself.So what's the film about? The story is about a group of amateurs robbing a bank in London, in the 1970's, them getting hold of some nasty photographs and half of London wanting their lost property back, in any way possible. Yeah, it sounds good and it's even British-made but I didn't enjoy it. I was expecting a great heist movie and was badly disappointed, most of the film concerning about the photographs. I just couldn't care less.The story was poor, as were the actors who all felt very much off-beat, probably concerned more about their paychecks than the actual art they were supposed to be making. The cinematography nor the director's efforts didn't do much good either. The whole film just seems wanting to be something much more than it really is, forgetting all the founding stones (that are the basis of any good movie) in the process – right casting, directional efforts, a working script. 1/4",The Bank Job

The movie is based on a heist were in a group of part timers are approached too rob a safety deposit vault in an English bank and what looks like an easy escape goes bad real fast. The movie as its advertised is based on true events and does look believable as reality to a point. This is not your usual plotted out heist film were they spend the most of the film planning the robbery and then executing it towards the end, The movie if pretty in-depth about the robbery from beginning to the end.

When they discover what's actually in some of the safety deposit boxes, they realise that their lives are now on the line because they've uncovered some dirty secrets about powerful people.The way the script meanders, with numerous twists and turns is a delight to behold, as are the visuals which display 1970's London with an authentic look and sound. There are so many ""villains"", that our bunch of thieves soon became the most innocent people in the story, as they try to dig their way out of the mess they find themselves in.With pitch-perfect performances (Jason Statham's Terry closer to his Lock Stock... performance) and highly entertaining script, this movie keeps ramping up the excitement and tension and it all culminates in a breathless climax.

In time, real gangsters, the Police and MI-5 are all chasing Terry's gang and roughing up each other. The movie is a grand bit of story telling. It is a great cops and robber story with lots if credible twists and turns. This is refreshing because we have all seen too many Hollywood crime pictures that are just too comical and science-fiction like Mission Impossible or Oceans 11+. It's entertaining, and would have been without its irrelevant nudity. This movie is not providing social commentary, or teaching us about history: it is just a fun story that is told well. Kudos to the writers, Clement and La Frendais. The performances are believable especially Jason Statham and Saffron Burrows --although the action oriented story does not test their range.

This movie is full of intense action and great wit. You will literally be at the edge of your seat up to the last minute, wondering if someone is either going to get killed or is someone going to get away. It is full of realistic drama, action, ultimatums, conspiracy and lust. At times it gets kind of scary and your heart will beat faster simply from the music. It is based on true story with a few additions of its own. The movie is put together absolutely perfectly.The movie is neither too long to the point it bores you and kills the story nor too short to where you don't know the outcome. Everything in the movie is timed perfectly and is played step by step. Everything makes sense which although eliminates some surprises, those surprises are hardly needed and are so obsolete that you won't even care nor realize.Overall the movie is ""jolly good"". British actors are really much better than American ones. All the emotions seem real and at a few points you'll feel just like the characters, which is great in any movie because it simply makes it more real. One more thing, this movie isn't for the faint of heart, there are a few scenes that are very graphic and gruesome, and a few scenes that should be in a rated ""X"" movie. Of course this doesn't do anything to the movie except add even more realism too it. This is just extra knowledge for those who may feel uncomfortable or squeamish in such scenes.

Every now and then a new element is introduced, keeping our attention while the action moves on. No major holes were found, with all the relevant elements linked and explained.

141,Grant_Price,Don't waste your time,2,13 March 2008,"What truly worthwhile aspects can be taken from a film like The Bank Job? Well, 'Mutton Dagger' for a start. Including that is nothing short of immature genius. Lots and lots of breasts is another. Expert alliteration using the world renowned C word is also significant. Aside from that though, there isn't much, leaving The Bank Job a vacuous and unpleasant experience. Anybody expecting another Lock, Stock or Snatch (as the marketing suggests) will be severely disappointed. Sure, director Roger Donaldson attempts to weave an intricate tapestry of lies, double crosses, witty dialogue and interrelated characters who all conveniently find themselves present at the less than satisfying climax, but he utterly fails. So many poorly executed sub-plots and underdeveloped characters are crammed into the running time that there isn't actually any room for anything else. Like interest. Or continuity. Or drama.The tepid story is based on an actual 1970s bank robbery which took place in London by a team of small time criminals. Amongst the safety deposit boxes in the bank's vault are a number of photographs depicting a member of the royal family in various promiscuous positions and a ledger containing the names of all the corrupt police officers in the city. Various interest groups do not want these items to fall in the wrong hands and so, with little imagination, try to retrieve them from the group of robbers. That's it. That's the whole story. It's VERY difficult to guess the outcome, like whether the cheeky criminals lead by wide boy Jason Statham will get away with it and live happily ever after or if the compromising ledger will fall into the hands of the only honest policeman in Scotland Yard, but I believe anybody not in a persistent vegetative state could probably work it out. A little more problematic though, is how everything actually all works out. The screenwriters noticed this during filming and helpfully included a couple of lines of dialogue in order to resolve any ambiguity which, to paraphrase, went like this: Bank robber: ""How did we get away with not getting arrested by the police for stealing millions of pounds, when they CLEARLY knew it was us, even if we did give them the ledger?"" Jason Statham: ""I don't know."" Excellent. No perplexity here. There is also a side story involving Black civil rights revolutionary Michael X (NOT Malcolm) which seems like it was shoehorned into the film during post production when somebody suddenly realised that the entire cast was white. It is difficult to recall anything about the cast, which consists mostly of cardboard cut-outs with voice-overs. There were policemen, whom you could tell were policemen because they arrived in twos, stood with their hands in the pockets of their flowing black coats and spoke as though they were doing somebody a favour every time they opened their mouths. The antagonists were easy to discern because they looked menacing and used four word sentences which were almost always dripping with malice/stupidity. Finally the good guys were the ones standing around Jason Statham whenever he was in a scene, unless it was a scene in which he was being menaced by the bad guys. It took really solid acting all round to convey this. It would have been mightily confusing otherwise.See this film either if you don't like money and like to rid yourself of it in the most boring ways you can think of or if you find it amusing to observe Jason Statham struggling through yet another miscast role: JS: Do I need to look angry or confused here? Director: Well, she's your daughter and you're giving her a present. JS: So...angry then? D: No, I'm kind of looking for loving and happy. JS (pulling a face): You mean like this? D: Well...that's more like confusion, don't you think? JS: I...can't tell.",The Bank Job
142,ruhi-yaman,Not quite what it could have been...,6,13 April 2008,"The most dangerous lies are those that are based on kernels of truth. This is why I cringe whenever I see the ominous words 'based on a true story' advertising a film. The Bank Job is the fictionalized story of the walkie-talkie robbery that took place in London in 1971. A small team of Cockney lads, existing on the margins of criminal milieu, successfully robbed the safety box vault of a posh branch of Lloyd's Bank and, on the face of it, got away with most of the proceeds. The film uses some of the facts (the crew was indeed spotted by a ham radio operator, only a handful of safety box owners made any claims) and lots of gossip (the rumour was that one of the safety boxes contained naughty exploits of a royal princess, another implicated a cross-dressing Lord Mountbatten) , then adds some of its own inventions: MI5, or was it MI6, staged the whole operation to recover the pictures and there was also a ledger detailing payoffs to crooked police by a porn king (David Suchet, unfairly looking like the late Ronnie Corbett). Jason Statham, as Terry the leader of the crew, does his Jason Statham act and the rest of the cast turns up to give reliable performances. The whole film works in its contrived and rushed way, but it is much less than what it should have been. The look of the film tries to emulate the 1970s heist flicks but the director (Roger Donaldson) is not sure whether he wants to make a Boulting Brothers style heist romp or a more grungy Brit gangster film. Light-hearted scenes suddenly give way to brutal torture of likable characters, farcical asides lead to serious exchanges. The look of the film, although generally true to the era, sometimes appears sloppy or rushed (underground signs, for example, look distractingly modern).It is an old-fashioned script with an old-fashioned structure. The use of real names for dead characters, with all the implications on their reputation and on their families, is a nasty element in the film, considering that it is largely based on gossip and innuendo, and it sits uncomfortably with the would-be comedy of bumbling crooks, spooks and coppers.",The Bank Job

144,phantomtristan,This is no Ocean's-style heist film,6,7 March 2008,"Despite a weak, B-rate feeling opening, The Bank Job manages to pull itself up and shape into a wildly engaging, gritty, realistic heist film that holds nothing back and does not have the comfy, playful feel of the Ocean's films. And here's the kick: its' based on a true story.Yes that's right, it is based on the true story of the 1971 Baker Street Bank robbery in England, considered to be one of the biggest bank robberies in British history. Terry Leather (played by Jason Statham) is in a spot of trouble. He owes money to some criminal bigwig, so when an old friend Martine Love (Saffron Burrows) comes along with a proposition for him and his two mates to rob a small bank's safety deposit box vault, he takes it. As they begin their job everything fits perfectly into place and moves along at a smooth pacean almost too smooth pace as very quickly the little proposition spirals madly out of control with secrets and double crossing being revealed, all before coming to a surprising ending.I was disappointed that characters were not as fleshed out and developed as I would have liked. However, Terry is done very well and I feel Jason Statham, the most underrated action movie star, has an almost Bruce Willis-type presence.The acting and dialogue was good, Saffron Burrows gives a bristling nuanced performance, and Terry's two mates Daniel Mays and Stephen Campbell Moore both bring a balanced energy to gang of criminals.The Bank Job is a rough, somewhat violent heist film that does not have a fun feel to it, however as it picks up from the mediocre beginning it holds you with a raw intensity that rewards you even more once the credits roll as you read the real life aftermath of the characters.",The Bank Job

The first 30 minutes were just filled with dull scenes and too cool for school Jason Statham pretending to drink a cocktail, a pint, and a glass of wine engaging in mundane conversations with various individuals. The only pleasant part was his voice which is why this film truly earned its lone star. Other than that I would recommend this to someone who can't sleep; this is about effective as ASMR.

149,ericjams,Above Average Caper Flick,7,17 March 2008,"As caper flicks go, all I really hope for is something that succeeds in being both novel and entertaining. My hopes were satisfied by The Bank Job. The plot itself is based very loosely on events that occurred in the 1970s in London. The royal family has some dark secrets. An outspoken activist/petty criminal/drug importer has evidence of these secrets, which he uses as leverage against the government who desperately wants to prosecute him. This evidence is stored in a safety deposit box within a London bank. British Intelligence conjures up a rather reckless plan of employing a bunch of two-bit/amateur criminals to break into the vault, and take the evidence along with whatever else they can carry out. Apart from one intermediary, none of the robbers know the government's secret agenda. Of course, things get complicated whenever the possibility that a bunch of dirty secrets are in the wrong hands, and eventually the movie juggles several interconnecting plot lines, all related to the contents of the vault and their implication on various interests from the royal family, to corrupt police, to the sexual indiscretions of parliament members.The movie keeps a good pace and never takes itself too seriously. It builds up the plot lines and tries somewhat successfully to tie everything together. There is some good tension, a bit of violence (not much), and eventually, vindication for most of the parties.The problems with the movie are numerous, but nothing that ultimately destroys the fun. Yes the movie is rife with inexplicably, unnecessary side characters (see female undercover agent in the Caribbean). Yes the movie's dialogue veers into indecipherable 1970s British slang, which gives a comedic undertone to conversations that are intended to be serious. Yes there exist rampant plot issues that make you wonder how stupid cops really are. And yes the acting is OK, at best, lets face it Jason Stracham is meant for British caper movies the way Keanu Reeves is meant to play a clueless surfer cop in Point Break - so while he's not winning any Academies, he fits these rolls just fine.You could wait for the DVD, or if you are looking for a fun way to kill 2 hours, you should go to the theater for this one.",The Bank Job

151,gregopego12,Engaging and suspenseful,9,24 September 2010,"You have a movie where the good guys aren't exactly good, and the bad guys aren't exactly bad. It's a peak into a world of elites who think they can pull strings like puppeteers, only to find that they aren't as clever as they think they are. And, since it's partially a true story, people in England may be feeling the ripples of the events today in their press and politics. The Center of the story shifts around, but all the arcs get pulled together at the end. We start with someone photographing someone for blackmail purposes. The blackmailer happens to be a criminal with pretensions of being a civil rights leader. He successfully mingles with celebrities and the gentry who want to entertain the rebellious side of society for a bit. He's busted, and decides to threaten to release the photos (kept in a safety deposit box) if the case against him continues. Then, he flees to Jamaica (I think) with a noble family's daughter spying on him for crown and country. Enter a model/ lord's secret girlfriend who now needs her own ""get out of jail"" card. She's given the task to round up a crew to break into the safety deposit vault and steel the photos. She enlists some old neighborhood chums who are a bit down on their luck with their honest professions and see the job as a foolproof score. What makes this movie great, is the fact it gives enough time for the bank job, and then the fallout.

This was a quality British heist movie, not just a bunch silver foxes forgetting to cash their pensions and robbing casinos instead. This film is structured around a true story, where fact runs true and fiction begins i'm not sure, but with a bit of creative writing they've managed to put together a plot full of characters you can empathise with, with side plots you actually care about and still have a bit of the true British beating from Statham lobbing bricks at bonces.

For me, unfortunately, 'The Bank Job' turned out to be a let-down. My overriding impression of the film when I walked out of the theater was that the movie was a messy piece of work. It's a half an hour too long, its multiple story lines never quite find their proper course (some of them are downright superfluous) and the ending, particularly the final scene, is preposterous.

Better still are the crictical reactions from both professional and amateur reviewers who, like me, conduct their historical research after seeing the film, giving an added intriguing dimension to one superb tale.
When it comes to such crime capers, writers such as Dick Clement and Ian La Frenais are masters of the art.With wonderful casting and superb acting throughout James Statham is in his element in this tale of criminal coercion, blackmail, double crossing and corruption that cuts through the very fabric of the social class system of the time. A tale where almost nobody is not involved in some sort of underworld, self promoting agenda. He plays a small time crook, lured by a mis-placed loyalty to a pretty face from his past (Saffron Burrows) into leading a small gang of equally amateurish crooks into raiding the safety deposit boxes at a local bank (Lloyds is a real bank chain in the UK), having been given assurance that the vaults are being conveniently left unguarded by a temporary security fault (yes this is true, it is the trusting 70s).The raid is a success .... or is it? The raid's success soon attracts the attention of some of the more ruthless, sadistic, professional criminal characters from higher up the pecking order of both The Underworld and the guardians of the political and social elite.It is a plot that intrigues and captivates from beginning to end, full of characters ranging from the downright nasty (David Suchet as the ficticious Lew Vogel and Peter De Jersey as the all too true Michael X) to those who elicit a bit more sympathy, being pawns in the greater scheme of thsoe who manipulate them (Hattie Morahan as Gail Benson, who really was the doomed daughter of a Member of Parliament).One of the best of such crime dramas to come out for a long time.",The Bank Job

A number of his previous roles have been darn memorable (The Italian Job, and The Transporter, just to name the most obvious).I will warn you now.... If you have had a hard time watching British movies previously.... because of the thick Old English accents, you will have a hard time with this movie. I am an old fan of BBC, so I did not have any trouble.Now this flick is solid, with good suspense, and a clean, although not perfect story/plot. If you have previously read any of my reviews.. I will be damned to play spoiler here.... so, if you want to know the story's' faults, go see it yourself. But still, it was an excellent movie, with great acting from majority of the actors/actresses. There is really not of a lot of action in this movie, it more of a mix of suspense with some mystery, mix in a little drama, and then add a tiny bit of action.. you have the Bank Job.It does get pretty intense, in a number of scenes. You should be able to feel the tensions, and feelings of the characters as they progress through the movie. Just wondering what lies around the next corner they come to.I am telling you that this is a pretty good movie, I suggest that if you like suspense dramas, and you like Jason Statham, and don't forget about Saffron Burrows (if you watch Boston Legal, or have seen Reign over Me with Don Cheadle, and Adam Sandler), you should know of her.

There have been a few which stand out and have a different genre of action ,comedy ,thrillers and such but the bank job combines all these elements and adds more to it in such a way that it keeps the audience gripped.The entire story is based on real events that were undertaken on Baker street in 1971 . The setting is in London and London in the 70's was amazing. The entire movie is divided into 2 main parts (The heist and the aftermath). This is Jason Statham at his best. He delivers A+ acting for his character and as usual uses his tactics that he had previously used in movies like transporter and Italian job. The dialogs however turn bland once in a while and sometimes the story strays too often away from its main plot . However in the end it leaves the viewer satisfied.The entire screenplay is over the top and innovative. Since it follows a true life incident sometimes it becomes unreal and sometimes a bit cartoony.Many parts of the movie is driven by corruption of politicians and the police and pornography and blackmail.It is an insane job to use all these elements based on a true story and bring a throughly entertaining and engrossing film-making experience.This is definitely a must watch",The Bank Job

The plot is based on real story which covers the 70's England. There is suspense but not much action like Jason's other movies. Jason usually does not act in movies which have stories, rather in ones with action. Could not recognize Saffron Burrows at first, but then remembered- played the role of Hector's wife, Andromache in Troy.I was overwhelmed with the choreography. It perfectly portrayed the 70's London. I have been to London before and the story does make me compare the present and past London.

I remember the watching the news and then nothing, never twigged there was a cover up, Everyone knew A member of the Royals was a naughty girl, just how bad was never revealed. I was OK with it as were most of the people I knew, the press were the problem as they were with Dianna. At 1:06:00 precisely you realize that Mick Jagger was one ugly son of a gun. Lol. One reviewer called Mick's appearance a ""cameo"" I thought a cameo was someone appearing as his or her self, not someone famous acting as someone else. Anyway, I would like to know what Mick was thinking, being on screen for a few seconds only. Anyway, Well worth a second watch knowing how each person ends up.

The research for this movie was non existent. After spending years in the motor trade during the period the film was supposed be set, I was reduced to tears of laughter at a guy turning a milometer back using an electric drill. You can be assured, that any motor trader from those days would not have needed a power drill to clock a car. The many inaccuracies contained in this film ensured that it couldn't be taken seriously.Goofs in a TV movie are just about acceptable because the TV movie is generally of the low budget type, but this was supposed to be a pukka film. The really bad wooden acting of Saffron Burrows was painful to watch. Jason Statham and the rest including David Suchet made the best of a bad script. The story thinly based on the Baker St safe deposit robbery could have been so much more accurate and without the drill, miles better. I could go on for a long time but I feel queezy just thinking about this bad movie. I watched the film free on Film Four so it only robbed me of time.",The Bank Job
162,stuartdr,Well crafted film full of humor and story,10,16 March 2008,"The Bank Job is a well done British film. It stars Jason Statham as the star role. The film is based on a true story regarding a gagged (As kept hushed from the public ears) bank heist in London. Main concern a rag tag group of people attempting to rob the safe deposit box of a bank to obtain some loot.Being a rag tag team group of people, it certainly makes for a quirky humorous group. The dialog seems very natural and fits the mood of average job Londoners. Mainly the character Dave serves as comic relief for majority of the film.The film does a good job at keeping the humor and drama steady and makes fluid transitions between the two. Both the funny parts and serious parts feels natural to the plot and is well done. The heist scene is very well done. It keeps the tension high but at the same time assiduously injecting wee bits of humor.One problem with the movie is how some of the subplots are confusing regarding how it relates to the main plot. Despite how the film explains and tie off most of it at the end, the first 1/3 of the film can have a lot of raise many questions that aren't quite explained until around the end.The ending is respectable and is very well done. A second climax end it off in a bang and then slowly finishes off the film. Again the film provides intensity/humor and story/drama to the very end which was very well done since it will keep you from getting bored.Overall, Jason Statham fans and those are like British humor and a film that incorporate a good balance of story and action/humor should enjoy this film. It is easily the most enjoyable film I've seen this year and I am looking forward to more films from Jason Statham in the future.",The Bank Job

If it had stayed lighter throughout, I'd have enjoyed it much more.All the actors were fine (I like the fact that you know what you're getting with Jason Statham - you don't *want* him to come across as 'actorly', you *want* him to play the lovable hard-man), the direction was slick, and the film was never boring.

I had no clue that it was based on a true story until the very beginning credits. The story was beautifully written not to mention the directing and I have to say that there was NOT one slow part in the entire film. The only problem I see with this film is that there hasn't been much advertisement but billboards about this film. I have not seen a movie trailer whatsoever regarding this film and its opening up next week.

I immediately fell in love with the settings and the scenery of the movie, it takes place in the 70's and the characters were superb. They basically sucked you into their reality and I not once had a moment of feeling that there was an actor on the screen, trying to give a convincing performance. The soundtrack matched the mood of the movie perfectly and it managed to put a smile on my face. Great job! The film may seem like it's going to feel long at first and knowing the title of the film, you keep waiting for it to be fulfilled, BUT be patient. You are greatly rewarded for it. The screenplay is in my opinion a masterpiece, a little complicated but brilliant! What I noticed in particular was how everything seemed to flow together perfectly - the characters, the soundtrack, the locations, the cinematography... None of it stood out, it was a perfect mixture of perfect ingredients. In its entirety however, next to most of the garbage which seems to find its way out of Hollywood nowadays, this is the albino chimp. This film STANDS OUT!

I'm not much of an action-film junkie, so I'm not that familiar with Jason Statham's work, other than what I've seen from the many trailers for his other movies. I was very impressed! He's a great anti-hero: conflicted, ambivalent, dodgy, passionate, quick-thinking, but in the end just a simple guy who wants to shed his past and make a better life for his family. My eyes were opened in the first scene where some thugs come to his car lot and break a few windows. Instead of round-house kicking them, he hangs his head, whines a little about his damaged inventory and wonders how he's going to get out of his shabby existence.Jason's character carries this movie in a gritty, plucky, underplayed, and oh-so-British way... from the muddled, disjoint beginning (I liked it, real life is muddled and disjoint and therefore so is the story) all the way through the ""Oh s$#@!! how are they going to get out of this?"" suspenseful ending.Worth the outrageous $10.50 we pay for movies these days.",The Bank Job

He also made a memorable performance in 'Van Wilder 2: The Rise of Taj' as Charlotte's father. Lauren Cohan (TV's 'Supernatural') played Charlotte, Taj's love interest. The acting all together was top notch. The dialogue was gritty and realistic. I loved the story. Each and every character had a memorable quality, worth talking about with your friends.

170,FourNineFoxtrot,Pretty good heist movie.,7,8 August 2008,"Interesting story, decent to good acting, and a healthy fill of violence, plus a bit of humor, make this a pretty solid movie.Statham does pretty much what he always does, and does it about as well as he ever does. Not as much an action movie as his recent films, but effectively the same character.Others have said that, for a movie set in the 70's, it really doesn't feel like one. This, I think, is true: I don't expect sepia tones and a constant barrage of classic rock, but a more pronounced period piece feel would probably have elevated this movie. Or at least given it some style.Which leads to my only serious gripe about the movie: No style. It left me cold. Had none of the fun and eccentricity of thematically similar, but stylistically different Guy Richie movies (Snatch and Lock, Stock), which Statham also figured prominently in. It may be unfair to compare this film to those, but the comparison was, well, unavoidable. Without that extra... something... this movie falls a bit short. It wasn't quite good enough to make it as a more serious heist movie, and the humor that was there seemed to indicate an uncertainty as to what kind of movie was being made: Were they trying to emulate Guy Richie, or Michael Mann? Too serious for the former, too light for the latter.A good effort, and not a bad movie. Not amazing, but solid.",The Bank Job

It might not have massive appeal outside the UK, however it is a good (based on fact) story. I'm not a massive fan of 70's music, but it wouldn't have done any harm to have a bit more in the background just to give it more of a seventies feel about it. The general mood of the film was good and for me seemed to set the scene well, without going overboard with sex or violence.

175,manar_alrawahi,Best heist movie I ever watched.,10,11 June 2014,"Scripted with a light touch by Dick Clement and Ian La Frenais and directed with considerable verve by Roger Donaldson, The Bank Job is a combination of heist movie and conspiracy thriller. It's a speculative account of what lay behind the actual robbery in 1971 of a branch of Lloyds Bank in London's Baker Street. Amazingly, a radio ham recorded the thieves' walkie-talkie conversation while they worked and alerted the cops, but no one was brought to justice.This was just a year before Watergate and the film's producers claim that whereas the Washington break-in opened the greatest can of worms of the 20th century, the scandal the London robbery would have revealed was squashed by the government issuing a D notice in the interests of national security.A case of life imitating art, the robbers borrowed their plan from Baker Street's most famous resident; Sherlock Holmes's tale 'The Red-Headed League' details how thieves tunnel into a bank vault from a shop down the street. The sympathetic minor villains, led by Jason Statham, have been conned into this caper by a beautiful model with underworld connections (Saffron Burrows), who's being blackmailed by the security- service people.She's after a safety-deposit box containing compromising photographs of a British princess having sex with a couple of black studs in the Caribbean. The pictures are being used by evil Black Power charlatan Michael X, respected friend of John Lennon and Yoko One, seen here dining with him, for blackmail purposes to keep the law at bay. But after a successful heist, the crooks discover that in addition to money and jewelry, they also have the account book of a Soho vice king (David Suchet) recording his bribes to the cops and compromising photographs of toffs, civil servants and politicians from the deposit box of a fashionable brothel-owner.So the hapless crooks are pursued by MI5, the Special Branch, ruthless gangsters, bent bogeys, a single honest cop (the one good apple in the Met's barrel) and the royal family in the form of a benign Mountbatten. The film races along with the speed of a bullet train, catches the 1960s ethos just as it had gone totally rancid and is a great deal of ugly, subversive fun.",The Bank Job

Nobody commits a crime & advertises it over a cell phone or walkie talkie. Just plain dumb & typical British stupidity throughout this whole movie as was the script.This is just one of millions of idiotic British movies that depict the raw stupidity of their entire countries' population & is an excellent example of why ALL British movies & TV shows should be burned & banned on this planet.

Outside of Terry, we barely know enough about the cops, the crooks, and the ""spooks""; all of them are basically one-dimensional pawns put into service to drive the plot along. And there is considerable plot which is briskly plowed through.Outside of the lack of technology, I wouldn't have known that this movie took place in the early 1970's if I wasn't told. I wasn't convinced of its time nor place. The stock dramatic musical score didn't help, as I was thinking that maybe a handful of songs from the period would have helped authenticate things.

If you're not looking for a story that goes very deep and are into a bit of British slang and humor as well, then you'll probably like this movie.Jason Stratum plays a part that is similar to the character in Lock, Stock and Two Smoking barrels.

My fiancé, on the other hand, is a sucker for any true stories, so we picked up the DVD. I was not expecting to like it at all, but the storyline was good, it was easy to follow, the characters were likable (or not, as appropriate!), and the action was good. I was not impressed by the apparent stupidity of the robbery crew (for example, having dinner delivered to the ""job site"", their overuse of the radios and most of all, their decision to take a NAP after they broke through the vault and then sticking around for so long after the robbery when they knew things the cops were on to them). Additionally, their was quite a bit of gratuitous (ie, senseless) nudity, which, as a woman, just made me roll my eyes. I understand that sometimes nudity is important to a plot, but I don't need to see 40 sets of breasts to understand that they're in a brothel.Overall, it was an enjoyable movie and worth the $14.99 for the DVD. :)",The Bank Job

It moves at a good pace that leaves you interested with the actual events in the film.The acting was well done. Jason Statham continues to be one of todays most under-appreciated and underrated actors. Yes, he does do some questionable action movies, but when you put him in a role where one actually needs to ""act"", he never disappoints.The dialog was ""catchy"" but still believable. The characters in this movie are believable in their ""sinister"" ways or their ""everyday joe"" kind of ways. You really do end up hating certain individuals and loving others. There are so many interesting characters that have an interest in the bank heist that you really do want to know how it all ends.There was no unnecessary violence just for the sake of violence and yet at points, it felt like an action thriller.In the end, this is a movie with a great plot, great characters, good dialog and an ending with no holes.

It isn't action packed with car chases and fight scenes as one might expect of a film starring Jason Stathan but there is plenty of intrigue and suspense with a welcome dash of humor here and there. Even the few bloody scenes were restrained but no less effective for it. The acting was low key which made it more realistic for me and all the more fitting because it is based on a true story. The villains are not over the top and are quite believable. I am a fan of both Stathan and Saffron Burrows so I was pleased that this was not a cheap ""B"" movie just made for the action junkies but a smart suspenseful, realistic thriller. I thoroughly enjoyed The Bank Job.",The Bank Job

195,sarangdotcom,great movie. surprisingly accurate. alota of...,9,23 April 2011,"people that are quite ignorant. I have read many reviews that claim that the story had a simple plot line, unrealistic, and weak. Well based on some further research, although some of the contents in the movie might have been conspiracy theories, most of the facts within the movie have factual evidence to support. There was in fact a man name Michael X(abdul malik) who was allegedly charged for the murder of two people. One of them being the woman he was seen killing in the movie. The way he killed her is described as the same way. Hacked to death in a predug grave. Also, Michael X's files were to be kept hidden until January 1st, 2054 according to the local newspaper that was covering the story. There was in fact a large sum of corrupt law officials at the time of the incident. News paper records show some detail of the events of the bank robbery. Conspiracy theories arise to explain the outcome of events, process of events, and suspects of events regarding the robbery. Its a movie, fabrications can be made to increase excitement. Too many people are being too picky with movies. It was a good movie. I did not fall asleep. and it kept me on edge during several points of the movie. All in all, it was a well made movie. Had a good transitional flow. and had many different elements involved.",The Bank Job

Saffron Burrows and that cute cleft chin is one fine woman, where has she been all this time!? Jason Statham is an under rated actor who seems to just get better! Absolutely loved the ending (that the good/ bad guys got away), and the corrupt politicians ended up taking it in the shorts. Funny how art mirrors real life, ala NY Govenor Spitzer, the jackass! I will and have highly recommend this movie, I did not expect that much out of it, but when I found out that it was based on a true bank robbery that I clearly remember from news reports of the day, I had to go and see it! Most definitely an 8 star movie for me!",The Bank Job
197,The_Psychic_Goat,Worst Film of the Year So Far!,1,11 February 2008,I saw this film at a free preview a few weeks before its official release. I was really looking forward to it having seen the trailer and was very disappointed by the quality of it.I don't mind British gangster films when done well. Layer Cake for instance was excellent and Snatch was alright but this seemed very poorly acted and the dialogue was laughable.I would particularly single out Saffron Burrow's acting as astoundingly poor. She was more wooden than a log cabin. Her character was supposed to trick the other characters into doing something and I found it surprising that they would believe her as it was so obvious that she was supposed to be lying. They would have had to be both blind and deaf for it to be believable that she could deceive them.Jason Statham did what he always does which I didn't mind in Crank as it was somewhat amusing but here I just found him very irritating. His character seemed a bit misogynistic and he was clearly supposed to be a 'loveable rogue' but I definitely disliked him.It did get slightly better in the second half to be fair but it was an extremely noisy and annoying film. It was also rather dull during the initial stages and I kept nearly falling asleep only to be woken a few seconds later by the noise.The main problem with this film is that none of the characters are at all likable. I really wanted them to get caught by the police! Not all characters have to be likable (eg There Will Be Blood didn't have any likable characters) but when you are supposed to be on someone's side and you just want them to fail then it's clearly not working.,The Bank Job
198,Carylefeew,Good!,7,28 February 2012,"I expected this movie to be somewhat entertaining, and maybe a bit cheesy. After all, it's not difficult to muck up a heist movie. However, this film gets it all right. The acting is top notch, the story is not only engaging and clever but TRUE (!), and the experience of seeing it is thoroughly enjoyable.The only complaints I have of the film are that the characters do get a little cheeky from time to time (but hey, they're British, so it's kind of expected), and there's a couple flashbacks/lapses in time that are initially confusing - although everything is clearly laid out about halfway through.

Occasionally it veered uneasily between (camp) comedy, (camp) sex/nudity and strong violence (horrid torture scene). The 70's setting was spot on (from my dim memory), with great evocation of that era in the clothes, cars, haircuts and attitudes. Overall a significant British crime caper, and certainly Stathams' best for a good while, although he still played Jason Statham, rather than essay a different character. That said, the last time I saw him try something different was Revolver...I liked it, and would thoroughly recommend it, but don't take your granny.",The Bank Job

It is a great heist movie that starts of slowly, and builds up to a payoff that leaves you satisfied. The first half sets up the characters and the storyline. Knowing that this was based on real life events made it just that more entertaining. The second half is ripper; edge of your seat stuff where i was cheering the characters along.

202,dcusano898,Good Action & Retro '70s,9,8 March 2008,"Paid my $12 on a rainy Friday opening night because of the plot--1971 London (a few years before I studied there), police/MI5/MI6 and based on a true story. I also hadn't been conscious of Jason Statham before this as ""action flicks"" with a lot of jumping martial artists,flying limbs (attached and severed) and crashing cars aren't my usual dish of tea. (BTW I'm a woman.) I was happily surprised and thoroughly enjoyed it. The pace never let up until close to the end, the plot didn't descend into implausibility, they got the look and feel of '70s London (mostly) and the acting was good. Statham can act enough to carry a picture, Richard Lintern was just perfect (and did the most acting) as the MI5 or 6 guy, David Suchet was pitch perfect as the Soho pornmeister with the weird moral sense, and Kelley Hawes was just right as the wife. I don't watch Boston Legal, but Saffron Burrows (where do they get these silly names?) as the setup girl for the heist team was only fair up to the ""bank job' and afterwards acted like she was punching a clock in the part of the film that needed the most help.If you're a car person like me, you'll love watching all the Britmobiles. You will wince at what's done to a particularly pretty Austin-Healey 3000 MkIII in Leather's used car garage by Perky at the very start of the film.BTW the website is heavy on clips, sound, Statham and totally shortchanges the cast.",The Bank Job

205,shjones88,The best bank robbery movie you'll ever see...,10,31 March 2008,"This English movie with no surprise didn't score high at the U.S. box office. Well, Requiem for Dream didn't either, and many consider it as one of the greatest movies ever. The bank job is the greatest bank robbery movie ever. And it is a true story, involving the highest secrets of the government, mixed with the biggest London thieves, and somehow related to these amateur robbers; this original melting pot works out great. It is kind of like an Ordinary Decent Criminal (with Spacey) but without the comedy, and with a better plot. It is true that the movie doesn't put you that much into the seventies because of the music, but that is not it's primary goal. Filled with action and suspense, the movie grips you onto your chair after the first minute of the movie. Unpredictable, this movie is a great entertainment for those who are looking for their hearts to pound a hundred times a minute for an more than an hour.",The Bank Job

The history of Jason Statham's movies made me slightly uneasy about the film because they usually consist of an abundance of action without much focus on the actual plot(The Transporter). I was surprised at how this movie was actually pretty fun to watch. Knowing that the plot outline is a true story, it was interesting to watch it unfold. The basic plot, without giving away too much information, is that there are compromising photos kept in a safety deposit box in a bank in London which must be broken into to obtain the photographs. Of course, there are plenty of twists in this movie to keep you guessing. Usually I am not a fan of British films but the humor was well placed and the action was spread evenly, appropriately climaxing at the end of the film. I recommend this film to someone who wants to go see a fun film without too much of a serious plot line.",The Bank Job
207,shreddedmeat,Absolutely awful...,3,7 March 2008,"I went to this movie with the hope that it might be enjoyable action/thriller. How wrong I was. An early contender for worst film of 2008.The acting was almost exclusively trash; certainly there were no stand out performances. Statham and Burrows are particularly wooden. The screenplay was utterly awful - in fact, there were several points at which I considered laughing out loud at the direly embarrassing nature of it. It was also far too long.I honestly don't understand how people can be saying this film is brilliant when one considers the competition still around in many cinemas - namely Juno, No Country For Old Men and There Will Be Blood.An absolute shambles on the whole, albeit fairly slickly made and it does pick up towards the end - however, there are very few films which I consider walking out of. This was one of them. Avoid.",The Bank Job

If you are a Jason Statham fan or are a fan of great suspense movies I recommend that you check this movie out. It is better than Statham's other movies such as Crank, Chaos, and Transporter 1 and 2. The rest of the cast is great as well. They keep the suspense going till the end of the movie not ever letting you know what will happen next. So, when looking for a movie to rent, I suggest you check out the Bank Job, you will not be disappointed. Based on a true story, the Bank Job is a story of lust, greed, drugs, sex, and cover-up that absolutely cannot go unwatched.",The Bank Job
209,nando1954,The Bank Job is a very interesting and energetic movie.,10,4 March 2008,"I had a lucky opportunity to see ""The Bank Job"" at a special evening advance preview screening somewhere in the wonderful U.S.A., and I have to write that I think it is a very interesting and energetic movie. I am a fan of Jason Statham and I think this is the best work he's done on film, even better than ""The Transporter."" Usually Statham plays a bad guy or a guy with a bad streak, and this time is no exception. But I really got a sense of how determined Statham's character was to protect his family from the fallout from the legendary bank robbery. I also really like the incredible 1970s feel of the film - it was as if it had been made in the early 1970s, what with the great rock music, the depiction of the swinging sex scene in London, the perfect costumes, and just the general overall style of the movie's look. I also loved the pacing of the movie, which was quick and up-tempo. Things moved along really well. I also liked the movie's different plot elements and its understanding of how money can corrupt everyone, even the upper crust, and how a scandal must be dealt with to avoid shock to England's Royal family. The movie is fun to watch and I enjoyed it thoroughly. It's definitely well-worth seeing. I don't know what movie the person who commented about the tunneling saw, but there was hardly that much tunneling - maybe a few quick scenes to establish things. They were in and out of the tunnel quickly. I never felt that the tunneling went on and on. And the pacing of the movie is so good that nothing drags or seems overdone. Statham's character reacted perfectly to everything that went on around him. This is a darn good movie, with good action and excellent acting. Saffron Burrows is very good and alluring and David Suchet really played the sleazy porno king very well. I would recommend this movie to fans of Statham, Burrows, and Suchet, to people who like caper movies, to people who like looking at London, and to people who enjoy the buzz that existed in the 1970s.",The Bank Job

The fact that the UK had a media black ban 'D' notice really makes for some investigations on the facts around the movie. finding out that there are recordings of the robbery many people that were around at the time absolutely believe this was a large robbery that was covered up, a right royal scandal and we all love them don't we! Amazingly the film was quoted as perhaps inspiring a major heist in Italy on February 26, 2008. on this night thieves unknown at the time of writing pulled an Oscar-night heist by tunneling into a famous jewelry store in Milan, Italy, to swipe $20 million in gems - as company bosses partied thousands of miles away in Tinseltown.

It is a great bank caper film with lots of parallel plots and plot twists. I am partial to Jason Statham, liking him in Transporter and Transporter 2 (who woulda thought 2 woulda been better?) and Saffron Burrows from seeing her in Boston Legal (who would believe an actress name from Indian rice?)I found the film to be thoroughly entertaining without requiring lots of mental input or intense concentration.As for bank heist films, i place this high but not as high as ""Inside Man"" which is, well, in a class by itself and which i recommend at the highest level.",The Bank Job

213,user-886-496032,Could have been a gem,6,1 January 2014,"When money spoils a good story.I know little about screenplay or script writing despite being on the fringe of TV and film production for six years but I do recall how financiers were more concerned with ensuring a profit than they were with the story. I mean the story is the whole point of it, isn't it? Sell them on the story and offer them good actors and direction to loosen the purse strings. More than once though they interfered at the eleventh hour and what would have been a gem was turned to mud instead.I watched The Bank Job with Jason Statham and Saffron Burrows. From my own very small involvement in its production I know that it was a film based on fact, so I was disappointed that the films financiers felt they had to completely alter those facts. The matter is no longer buried by the Official Secrets Act so they have no excuse. Robbing a bank to save Princess Margaret's reputation gave them a chance to throw a bit of sex and scandal in, but the real story was that in one of those safety deposit boxes was a Cold War intelligence coup so great that once handed to the authorities by the robbers, not only was all the evidence against the gang quietly destroyed but so were their previous criminal records AND they were allowed to keep everything else they had stolen. The investigation carried on (in name only) so as not to tip off the Russians.I think I know which would have made the better film and I am pretty sure the writers, Dick Clement and Ian La Frenais ('Porridge' : 'Auf Wiedersehen, Pet' : 'Lovejoy') knew it too. Once again the money men got it wrong.They were filming Jason's garage in Southwark, beside the Thames a stones throw from the old Fire Station used in 'London's Burning' Ironically only the location manager and myself knew that they were making a movie about tunneling to commit a robbery of a million or so pounds and they were in reality stood quite literally fifty feet above two billion in gold as the location was across the narrow road from what was back then a massive covert vault.From time to time local residents may object to the presence of a film unit but this was the only one where one used a forklift truck to attack the portable generator.",The Bank Job

Good supporting cast with many faces you will recognise (spot the Eastender) apart from a terrible performance from Stephen Campbell Moore who looked like he was on a comedy show.

219,pamelakilroy,"If you like action films that are actually boring, still don't see this movie",2,7 April 2008,"2 is a generous score for this film, as it really has no redeeming value whatsoever. There are so many things wrong with ""The Bank Job"" it's hard to know where to start. The most glaring flaw is probably with the editing, which was incredibly disjointed and abrupt. It's possible this was part of an effort to artificially create a hectic action-film style pacing, but many of the scenes were slow, boring, and unnecessary, so that really doesn't qualify as an excuse. My friend K.J. joked it seemed like someone had taken the film print and chopped at it haphazardly then marked it final cut.The editing also contributed to the other enormous flaw with this film: its confusion over its own identity. It is advertised as being based on a true story, but it is filmed like a typical Hollywood action-heist film complete with the cheesy musical score and every cliché in the book. Thus, the weight of the events never hits home with the audience, and when characters are brutally tortured and/or murdered, there is little to no emotion by either the characters or the audience. On reflection this is actually quite disturbing and irresponsible film-making, and probably the result of trying to fit all the elements of a very interesting story into the framework of a fast-paced action film. The result is that the plot is sloppy and forgettable, while the action is boring and unsatisfying.The movie is best summed up by the scene in which a shot of one of the dead characters leads to an extended close-up of the peace emblem on the bracelet of the dead character. The shot seems to bring up themes of peace and tragedy in a film that has spent literally zero time developing either of those themes. It is instead implying the message, ""You recognize this symbol and therefore know how you are expected to feel when you see it, but we don't have time to subtly and artfully elicit that emotion, so just think of other better movies and remember this is a TRUE STORY.""If you are thinking of seeing this movie because you are interested in the story, do a google search instead. If you are thinking of seeing this movie because you like action-heist movies and have already seen Inside Man, watch Inside Man again. Even the smallest fragment of dialogue you missed while crunching on a Dorrito will have infinitely more value than anything in this witless vapid excuse for a movie.",The Bank Job
