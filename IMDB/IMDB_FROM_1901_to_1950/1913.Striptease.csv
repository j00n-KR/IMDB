0,MartinHafer,Bad...just not as bad as you'd imagine based on those Razzies.,2,8 May 2016,"""Striptease"" is a multi-award winning picture. Unfortunately, these are Razzie Awards---awards given for god-awful films and performances. It received an amazing seven nominations and took home six awards--including Worst Movie and Worst Actress! This puts the film is a very unique league...as few films have been nominated or won like ""Striptease"". This alone is the reason I watched the film...I was curious how bad this bad movie could be.The film is about Erin, a divorced mother whose husband is a trashy criminal...yet we are to believe the judge game HIM custody. Regardless, this ex- made sure she lost her job and now she has been 'forced' to become a stripper. With no experience, she instantly becomes a star attraction and the men in the club go positively insane when she dances. During one of these times, a crazy congressman (Burt Reynolds) gets out of control and soon all sorts of unforeseen situations result.So is this really a bad film? But what's surprising is that it's basically an ultra-low budget trash film...or that's what it looks like. Yet, inexplicably, the movie had a HUGE budget--including $12,000,000 for its star, Demi Moore!! Why they chose her, I have no idea as her appearing semi-naked didn't help the film to become a success. Instead, they could have easily gotten a cut-rate stripper and saved a LOT of money. And I think this huge budget and big studio treatment for essentially a trash film is why it got so many Razzies. If it was just some cut-rate trash film, no one would have noticed it and the film would have quickly disappeared. The film suffers because it's a bizarro script that seldom makes sense, has characters who simply are caricatures instead of believable members of the human race and because the film cannot decide what it wants to be. Is it a comedy? Is it a raunchy film? Is it a drama about a mother trying to regain custody of her kid? Is it a murder mystery? Is it a film about politics and the abuse of power? Is it an episode of ""The Jerry Springer Show""? Any one of these might have worked...but together the film is just brain-achingingly weird and nonsensical--especially by the very end. Not bad enough to have earned 6 Razzies...but pretty bad.",Striptease
1,TheLittleSongbird,Sleaze tease,4,24 August 2018,"Was put off for a very long time from watching 'Striptease'. Not because of the negative critical reception, that it looked and sounded bad and the Razzie awards, but because many people and friends persuaded me not to give it a chance and said that it was as bad as its reputation. Have a vast majority of the time respected and trusted their opinions just in case one is wondering.Having however heard how good the book was, a large part of me was interested in reading it. Found the book to be brilliant, it is very funny, very clever and very insightful. Wanted to finally see how 'Striptease' as a film would fare so finally caved in and decided to give it a chance. Doing so, that it does not do the book justice is the least of its problems. Didn't find it quite as bad as its reputation, but can totally see the dislike and agree with a lot of criticisms directed at it. The flaws are many and they're big, but 'Striptease' is not without its moments.'Striptease's' biggest fault is the script, weak enough to have a near-paragraph of its own and bring the film down significantly. The satire isn't anywhere near close to being sharp enough, it is heavy-handed rather than insightful and in an attempt to pull punches it goes well overboard on the sleaze, the humour jars badly as well, is not placed well and is not funny generally. The characters are too much like caricatures and jar as much as the humour and how seriously the drama is taken, and the mystery/crime elements and the comedic elements are not harmonious together, instead feeling like two (or more) different films.The story is not much better, there is a lack of energy, the dance sequences are more gratuitously sleazy, it is more pure tack than sexy and the sentimentality gets far too much. Anything dramatic is lost amidst all of the script and story faults and undermined by the complete lack of mystery due to too many early reveals (i.e. the villain identities). Andrew Bergman has done some great work, his direction here is not representative of that, the story fails to interest or come alive and it all felt tonally unfocused. Demi Moore may look good, something that 'Striptease' exploits, but she looks uncomfortable and plays her challenging role too seriously, with her character also written too seriously and sticking out like a sore thumb with the rest. Robert Patrick overdoes it as his cartoonish character. As said however, 'Striptease' has moments. The best asset is most of the supporting cast, who seem to clearly know what film they're in and how to play the characters. Burt Reynolds in particular is a delight and seems to be having a ball. Ving Rhames is also great, classy fun without going over the top, the film is worth a one-time watch for those two alone.Howard Shore's score is pleasant enough and the songs fitting reasonably well, the only sour note on the soundtrack being the one from the Light Crust Doughboys that deservedly received a Razzie award, don't always agree with Razzie nominations and wins but they were spot on here. The production values were reasonably slick.Overall, not that bad but for a film with so many big problems that is not so big an endorsement. 4/10 Bethany Cox",Striptease
2,SnoopyStyle,"so bad, it's funny.... ?",4,26 November 2015,"Erin Grant (Demi Moore) loses her secretary job at the FBI due to her criminal former football star ex-husband Darrell (Robert Patrick) and loses custody of her daughter Angela (Rumer Willis) due to losing her job. She ends up stripping at the Eager Beaver trying to earn the money to appeal the decision. Congressman David Dilbeck (Burt Reynolds) becomes a big fan. Shad (Ving Rhames) is the bouncer. Her fan Jerry comes up with a scheme to use the congressman to get to the judge. Jerry is killed and police detective Al Garcia (Armand Assante) investigates.This is deliberately stupid and the characters are deliberately ridiculous. Yet Demi Moore is playing it completely serious which is the way that she's written. The movie is caught between a scary Lifetime movie and a wacky comedy. It is utterly unsustainable and none of it works. There are points where the movie is so bad that it borders on being funny. Mostly, it's cringe-worthy.",Striptease
3,Hitchcoc,Don't Bother,4,3 January 2017,"I was channel surfing and hit HBO and struck upon this movie. I remembered this movie being in the theaters and that the title was certainly provocative. I think Demi Moore is a pretty good actress (although she seems to have disappeared off the face of the earth) so I suppose she decided to be a rebel and show off. The plot is so ridiculous and the characters so shallow, that it's hard not to laugh at times that are supposed to be serious. I found Burt Reynold's character to look sort of sick. The struggle for custody certainly wouldn't be helped by her choice of employment. But mostly, instead of being a bad movie that had an element of naughtiness, it is just plain dull. This is the woman who played a really cool character in ""A Few Good Men.""",Striptease
4,classicsoncall,"""Do you have any idea how nuts this was?""",5,13 May 2021,"That's a quote by someone in the movie and not my comment on the film in my summary line above. But it just as well could be, because it's difficult to figure out what kind of film this was supposed to be. Some of it's played for laughs, while a lot of time is spent on Erin Grant's (Demi Moore) desire to get back custody of her daughter after an unsympathetic judge awarded same to her criminal husband (Robert Patrick). He's not even her ex-husband, which makes things all the more absurd, as he constantly tries to thwart Erin from spending time with her child. On top of all that, Grant becomes a stripper at the Eager Beaver to make ends meet, not exactly your best recipe when filing for a new motion.I'll say this though, Demi Moore makes for one seductive performer, and I'm a bit surprised at how daring her performance was in this film, given those scenes in which she bared almost all. I had to rewind that scene where she removed the towel from her head after taking a shower; I wonder how many takes that took to get it just right. Unfortunately, we never do get to see a creamed corn wrestling scene, and I thought it a little unsympathetic to take out a hit on Monty Python, but I guess that's the way things go in a movie with the title ""Striptease"".The most embarrassing performance here has to be that of Burt Reynolds as the demented Congressman David Dilbeck. He plays his character as a caricature, and I got the biggest kick out of a line by someone stating that he and his campaign manager (Paul Guilfoyle) 'had to go on Willie's orders'. Presumably Willie would have been President Bill Clinton, who had the appropriately applied nickname of Slick Willie by the press of the era. I couldn't think of a better way for this picture to end than to have all of Dilbeck's goons buried under a pile of sugar at the finale. Def Leppard would have been proud.",Striptease
5,jboothmillard,Striptease,4,21 September 2005,"Taking off her clothes was quite a popular thing, so somebody thought, why don't we get Demi Moore to do it throughout a whole film, and it happened, from director Andrew Bergman (Honeymoon in Vegas). The result a higher pay for Moore, more flesh than usually shown and a rather silly script/story. Anyway, Erin Grant (Razzie winning Moore) needs to get a job that earns a lot of money so she can have proper custody of her little girl, so she decides to become a stripper in a rather popular Las Vegas type club. She earns loads of money from using really good Annie Lennox songs and the power to dance and flash her flesh. Also starring Razzie nominated Burt Reynolds as Congressman David Dilbeck, Pulp Fiction's Ving Rhames as Shad and Terminator 2's Robert Patrick as Darrell Grant. Personally, it is only worth seeing for the nudity content. It won the Razzies for Worst Picture, Worst Original Song for ""Pussy, Pussy, Pussy (Whose Kitty Cat Are You?)"", Worst Screenplay and Worst Screen Couple for Moore and Reynolds. Okay!",Striptease
6,ccthemovieman-1,More Baloney Than Bare Facts,4,16 August 2006,"This soft-core glossy skin flick (which is what it is, if you're honest about it) actually was better than I anticipated. the story was interesting all the way through, featured some great female bodies of course, but had decent acting and photography. The nudity involved breasts, nothing else and there was no sex. Demi Moore looked awesome at times; too tough-looking at other times.Robert Patrick and Burt Reynolds played over-the-top characters who got a bit annoying after awhile. Reynolds is particularly sleazy and they use him in this film to denigrate elected officials and people who speak out for ""family values."" Hollywood loves to trash the latter, having no values of its own. They also trash Republicans and a group called ""Young Christians,"" just more typical cheap shots of the Libeal film-making industry. They are unrelenting.The only likable character in the movie is played by Armand Assante, although the film makes you root for Moore in her custody case.I understand the book is much. Gosh, that's a surprise!",Striptease
7,BA_Harrison,It's no Showgirls.,2,9 August 2016,"I can remember Striptease being sold to the public as the film where Demi Moore flashes her newly augmented cans, the A-list actress paid a whopping $12.5 million to play stripper Erin Grant, whose quest to gain custody of her little girl (played by Moore's real life daughter Rumer) lands her in deep water with a sleazy congressman (Burt Reynolds) and the shady businessmen who back him.If seeing a lot more of Moore is all you're after, then you'll be as happy as the proverbial pig, the muscular actress jiggling her jugs and bodybuilder's butt throughout, but anyone expecting anything remotely resembling a decent film will feel more than a little disappointed: the plot is as cheesy as hell, the characters are incredibly clichéd, and the comedy is embarrassingly bad.At least Moore made a tidy fortune out of this mess, but I imagine Burt Reynolds, Ving Rhames (as lovable bouncer Shad), Armand Assante (concerned cop Al Garcia) and Robert Patrick (Erin's low- life ex) made total idiots out of themselves for a lot less.",Striptease
8,moonspinner55,There must be a more painless way to see Demi Moore disrobe...,2,25 June 2006,"Shabby comedy-drama from Carl Hiaasen's novel has former-FBI clerk Demi Moore turning to stripping at the Eager Beaver in order to pay off her legal debts; seems she's in a fight to retrieve her child from her ex, yet the film doesn't see stripping as disreputable, thereby presenting Moore's Erin Grant as a hard-working heroine with a heart of gold for us to sympathize with. Director Andrew Bergman may have helmed this project blindfolded, how else to explain the sketchily-drawn characters, the ridiculous strip-club sequences or a dire subplot involving Congressman Burt Reynolds? Solid supporting turns by Armand Assante as a cop and Ving Rhames as a bouncer give the film its only validity. As for Moore, she isn't a bad actress, nor is she a stupid one, but the $12 million she acquired for her non-performance here seems like a joke on the audience--and on Hollywood. * from ****",Striptease
9,sunwarrior13,All About Demi Moore's Body,5,14 December 2011,"Striptease is about a stripper who becomes involved in both a child- custody dispute and corrupt politics.It is a sex comedy film directed, produced, and written by Andrew Bergman. The film stars Demi Moore, Burt Reynolds, and Ving Rhames. The film is based on the novel of the same name by Carl Hiaasen.The screenplay,based on a satirical novel, tells the story of Erin, who has just gotten a divorce from Darrell, the sleazy ex-con she foolishly married. However, the judge's memories of Darrell's days as a football hero win him custody of their daughter, and Erin, concerned for her child's safety, is determined to fight the decision. Erin has just lost her position as a secretary for the FBI, so, to cover her legal bills, she takes a job as an exotic dancer at a strip club called the Eager Beaver. While she has no experience taking off her clothes in front of an audience, Erin soon makes friends with the fellow dancers and finds a protector in the club's burly but good-hearted bouncer, Shad. She also makes a few fans among the regulars at the club, most notably David Dillbeck, a drunken lout with a bottomless appetite for sleaze -- who also happens to be a conservative congressman with ties to right-wing religious groups. One of Erin's admirers snaps a photo of her with the congressman when a brawl breaks out at the club, and he suggests that it would make fine blackmail material. However, when the man with the photo turns up dead, Erin discovers that Dillbeck's people play a bit rougher than she expected. This movie showcases nothing but Demi Moore's star appeal and sexy body.Nothing more.Andrew Bergman's screenplay and storyline was a complete mess.Personally,I do believe that this movie,Striptease together with G.I. Jane,practically placed Moore's stardom into a downhill and it never recovered since then.She could have been a better actress had she chosen better materials after attaining popularity in Ghost instead of going for the high paycheck that movie offers come her way that does nothing except use her star appeal rather than her showcase her acting ability.",Striptease
10,Theo Robertson,Guys It's Not Meant To Be Serious,5,19 August 2005,"Some people take both life and cinema far too seriously . Look at STRIPTEASE for example . The opening scene takes place in a court where Erin Grant is fighting for custody of her child against her husband Darell who has a serious problem with drugs . The judge decides that because Erin is unemployed pill popping Darell should get the kid ! Erin realises that the only way to get the kid back is if she gets a job as a stripper at The Eager Beaver nightclub and on her first night there she blows away the opposition . Got that a woman who has never stripped before is miles better than than the old pros who have been doing their dance routine for years . In fact she's so good Congressman Dilbeck feels duty bound to save her from a punter by hitting a drunken punter over the head with a champagne bottle . Hmm so you've got a senior politician who frequents The Eager Beaver nightclub which obviously doesn't harm his career prospects and assaults a fellow patron andnobody calls the press ! That's just the start of the movie ( And it gets more and more incredible as it goes along as if you hadn't noticed ) but people come on to this site to say what a terrible movie it is ! Thanks for pointing this out but it's not actually supposed to be a great movie is it ? It's done tongue in cheek with Burt Reynolds giving a career worst performance as Congressman Dilbeck . This alone would have made it watchable enough without Demi Moore flashing her silicon enhanced breasts around at every opportunity . If you think this is a serious movie then perhaps Ving Rhames role as Shad is a knowingly ironic character: "" No it's a f--kin' shrimp . Course it's a roach "" which is a clever way of explaining to the less clued up audience members that it's not a shrimp , a roach or a turkey - It's a tongue in cheek movie",Striptease
11,lastliberal,Florida politics on display,5,28 June 2008,"I am a big Carl Hiaasen fan and, while this may not be his best work, it certainly exposes the flaws in Florida politics for all the world to see. While certain environmentalists are celebrating Governor Charlie's transfer of $1.7 billion to Big Sugar, you can see in this film, even in a comical way, how they have out congressmen in the bag.Demi has come up against DCF and has to do anything to get her children back. Unfortunately, she has come into the clutches of Congressman Burt and his evil henchmen. I really didn't think her performance was all that terrible, and I certainly appreciated the new work she had on display in a very skintastic moment, just as I appreciated seeing the lovely Pandora Peaks, Rina Riffel (Candyman 3), another skintastic performance by Dina Spybey, and that snakey performance of Barbara Alyn Woods. Let's hear it for all the fine performance that took our attention away from, well, I guess there wasn't much else.Ving Rhames was good as usual, and I did enjoy Armand Assante. But, that aside, it was the performance on stage that really stand out.",Striptease
12,Boba_Fett1138,Is it a comedy or a drama?,4,2 November 2005,"The filmmakers really didn't seemed to be able to make up their minds. At times the movie feels like a drama but at times and especially in the last 30 minutes the movie suddenly turns into a (lame) comedy.This movie is truly a waste of talent. There are a lot of good actors in this movie such as Demi Moore, Burt Reynolds, Armand Assante, Robert Patrick and Ving Rhames. Also the music by Howard Shore really isn't bad and deserved a better movie.The movie makes a really pointless impression. The story felt highly unlikely and the movie was filled with many implausible moments. Also it may sound weird but also all of those striptease sequence got really boring after a while and they felt like they were put in the movie to put some life in it. Unsuccessfully though. ""Striptease"" is a failed movie that doesn't take itself serious enough at times with as a result that the already flawed story becomes even more ridiculous at times.Still a tiny bit better than ""Showgirls"" though.4/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",Striptease
13,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,A T&A movie... with a plot?!? Who came up with that?,1,5 September 2004,"Like Paul Verhoeven's Showgirls, this is a T&A movie. The thing is, while Verhoeven knew what T&A was about(T&A standing for Tits and Ass, it's obviously nudity), Andrew Bergman(who I suppose is the person to blame for this movie) doesn't; I guess he thought it should be more than just nudity, and tries to inject a drama plot. Newsflash: naked girls and family troubles don't mix. Any teenager can tell you that. Apparently, Bergman didn't know, or maybe he was trying to ""break new ground""... who knows. The result is a mess. One minute you're seeing half-naked ladies with fake breasts, the other you're expected to care about the main character's child and her difficulties with getting custody. It just doesn't work. The plot is decent at best; it probably could have worked, with a hell of a lot of work done to it and in a very different movie. But as it is, it doesn't work, on any level. The acting is mostly ridiculous; I guess the actors didn't take it too seriously and just went through it as campy as they could. Apart from Demi, who apparently believed that the film was serious. The characters are poorly written clichés. Robert Patrick's character is too cartoonish, and, frankly, belongs in a slapstick comedy. It was interesting to see a role so different from the hard-ass characters he normally portrays, but still. He added very little comic relief, and mainly came off as a pathetic attempt at it. Burt Reynolds' character was also so over the top that you didn't know whether to laugh, cry, or feel sorry for him. The dialog is amateurish and the script is poorly written. The humor is childish and the film tries far too hard at making you laugh, which pretty much only results in the audience cringing over it. Basically, the film could have been something, had it just determined to be a drama or a T&A flick; 'cause it sure as hell doesn't work well as both. The climax of the film brings one or two smirks, but no real laughs, and in the end, you feel like you've just wasted almost two hours that could have been spent doing something far more creative. If you want to look at naked women, find a better T&A film, or search the Internet. If you want to see a naked Demi Moore, look for one of the other films where she gets undressed, or, failing that, look for screen-caps of this film. Whatever you do, avoid this one. It's really bad. Really. Bad. I recommend this to no one, apart from possibly people who are willing to do anything and watch anything just to see Demi's breasts. Or people who'll watch anything, for one reason or another. 1/10",Striptease
14,Uriah43,The Stripper Versus the Sleazy Politician,5,9 November 2018,"This film begins with a woman named ""Erin Grant"" (Demi Moore) arguing for custody of her young daughter before a judge. Unfortunately, the judge rules against her because of her current occupation as a stripper even though she has explained to him that she was fired due to her husband's criminal misconduct. Not long afterward, while performing her routine at the stripclub, a brawl occurs involving a person who just happens to be a morally flawed United States Congressman named ""David Dilbeck"" (Burt Reynolds). Yet, even though he was wearing a disguise to hide his true identity, he is still recognized by a couple of people. And this creates a huge problem for them as Congressman Dilbeck has surrounded himself with people who are intent on keeping him in power and are willing to take whatever measures are necessary to keep his reputation intact. And their ruthlessness becomes even more pronounced as his lust for Erin increases-with those able to identify him becoming prime targets. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that this was an extremely uneven film due in large part to the ambivalent direction, meandering plot and horrific acting of Burt Reynolds. On the other side of the equation, I liked the performances of Ving Rhames (as the bouncer named ""Shad"") and the aforementioned Demi Moore who I thought was absolutely sensational. That being said, in spite of the rather obvious flaws, I still liked this movie to a certain degree and I have rated it accordingly. Average.",Striptease
15,anaconda-40658,Demi's Career Laid Bare.,2,13 July 2015,"Striptease (1996): Dir: Andrew Bergman / Cast: Demi Moore, Ving Rhames, Burt Reynolds, Robert Patrick, Armand Assante: What woman is stupid enough to believe that this film is helping their image? Title indicates that this morbid entertainment is an illusion or a tease. Demi Moore loses a child custody battle so she bares her boobies for cash. She is the centre of attention of a drunken congressman who is so obsessed with her that he has items of her clothing stolen. Eventually he offers her a large sum of money to dance for him privately. He soaks himself in Vaseline and lusts after her. Too many erotic dance sequences and too little plot. Locations and costumes have appeal but structure is predictable. Director Andrew Bergman used similar themes in Honeymoon in Vegas but his talent here is uninspiring. Moore basically prostitutes herself in facing what many strippers are up against but she isn't doing herself any favours. She has never looked more stunning but that is all part of the tease. Burt Reynolds is amusing yet unreadable as the congressman overcome and overthrown by lust. Ving Rhames plays the stereotypical bodyguard. Robert Patrick is given the thankless role of ex-husband whose final scenes are embarrassing. Armand Assante plays a cop who should be searching for a decent script for Mr. Assante. Mindless circus act serves only as a cheesy erotic peep show. Score: 2 / 10",Striptease
16,AaronCapenBanner,Demi Moore,1,3 December 2013,"Andrew Bergman directed this film that stars Demi Moore as a recently divorced young mother who has lost custody of her daughter Angela(played by Rumer Willis) to her thief ex-husband Darrel(played by Robert Patrick) so she takes a job as a stripper in a nightclub, and is a big hit, though must dodge the unwanted attentions of a lecherous Senator(played by Burt Reynolds) who is involved with the murder of one of her admirers that was blackmailing him, and that a police Lt.(played by Armand Assante) is investigating. Despite Demi's undeniable beauty and skill in her dance/strip routine, this film is dreadful, both poorly directed and written, with (mostly) unappealing and obnoxious characters, and utterly unfunny comedy. A dud.",Striptease
17,JamesHitchcock,As a stripper she's good. But as an actress...?,4,9 October 2020,"The plot of ""Striptease"" is a complicated one, and I will not attempt to set it out in full here. Suffice it to say that the main characters are:-Erin Grant, a former secretary with the FBI who becomes a stripper in order to raise the money she needs for a legal costs in a bitter child-custody dispute.David Dilbeck, a corrupt Congressman in hock to Big Sugar interests. He becomes infatuated with Erin after seeing her perform.Darrell, Erin's ex-husband and a petty crook.Al Garcia, a police detective investigating a murder linked to Dilbeck's powerful backers.The star is Demi Moore, who in the early nineties was one of Hollywood's leading young actresses. The fact that she was offered $12.5 million, a world record payment for any actress at the time, to star in this film is evidence of just how highly regarded she was. I have heard it suggested that the salary was so big because the producers needed a big-name star but no other big-name star in Hollywood was willing to reveal as much of her body as the script required her to do. (And I must admit I just cannot imagine the likes of Michelle Pfeiffer, Meg Ryan or Julia Roberts in the role. To say nothing of Meryl Streep). In financial terms, therefore, it was a wise move for Demi to accept the part. In terms of her wider career it was anything but. ""Striptease"" was not the sole cause of her once-glittering career going into decline- it was only one of a number of unwise choices she made around this period- but it certainly didn't help.""Striptease"" was based on a novel by the Floridian writer Carl Hiaasen. Unlike the film, the book is sharp and satirical, funny but with a serious edge about the darker side of life in the Sunshine State. By comparison the film looks flabby; there are a few easy laughs, but the cutting edge of Hiaasen's satire is lost. So just what is so bad about it? Well, despite that $12.5 million paycheck, a lot of the blame has to be down to Demi herself. As a stripper, she's good, with the looks and the firm, toned body needed for the part. But as an actress?The problem with the film was summed up by the critic Nathan Rabin, who pointed out that Demi, when not gyrating and revealing her charms to the world, looked as though she were acting in a serious drama about a struggling single mother whereas the rest of the cast were trying to make a zany crime comedy. Perhaps she had got director Andrew Bergman mixed up with his gloomy namesake Ingmar. Even Bergman had to admit that Demi isn't the world's funniest person. And when you're trying to make a comedy and your $12.5 million leading lady insists on treating it like a serious drama, you've got problems. Did he never think of saying ""Lighten up, Demi!"" Perhaps in Hollywood you don't tell someone that expensive to lighten up.Bergman's next line after ""Lighten up, Demi!"" should have been ""..and tone it down, Burt!"" Burt Reynolds, trying to get as far as possible from his tough-guy image, is massively over-the-top as Dilbeck, even by the standards of zany comedy, playing him as a sex-mad buffoon and ignoring the fact that Dilbeck is actually dangerously corrupt. Robert Patrick as the crooked Darrell also plays his character essentially for laughs, making the confrontations between Darrell and the straight-faced Erin seem very incongruous.Although ""Striptease"" was widely regarded as a flop, it was not a disastrous box-office failure; worldwide it actually made a profit. It under-performed, however, in the American market and was almost universally loathed by the critics. It won seven Razzies, including ""Worst Picture"" and ""Worst Actress"" for Moore. Burt Reynolds failed to win ""Worst Supporting Actor"", but I must suspend judgement on that decision until I have seen the performance which took the award, Marlon Brando's in ""The Island of Dr. Moreau"".In the seventies and eighties and early nineties, there was a growing trend towards eroticism in the mainstream American cinema. It was assumed that sex sells and that only a few puritanical killjoys would object. And then, suddenly, this trend seemed to go into reverse around the mid-nineties. It wasn't so much that the New Puritans had won or that we were heading back to the days of the Hays Office. It was more a realisation that sex doesn't always sell. Along with the likes of ""Body of Evidence"" and ""Showgirls"", ""Striptease"" was one of the films which forced Hollywood to re-evaluate one of its most cherished maxims. 4/10",Striptease
18,Smells_Like_Cheese,"At least Showgirls had personality, what was this?",1,22 March 2009,"I was cruising through my movie channels and I saw that Striptease was playing, I remember seeing the trailer for this movie back in 1994 when I was a kid and wanted to see it, oh, my parents had to forbid it. But of course since I'm 23 and on my own, I think I was allowed to view it. I kinda wish now that I had my parents here to tell me no because this movie was really bad. I mean most people make fun of Showgirls, I mean yeah, it's understandable, but at least that had personality and more memorable moments than this. Demi Moore just strips down to some really depressing music and this movie has the strangest humor in the world. I could see how some people might get a kick out of it, but over all it just a bad movie, it has no zest and nothing to make it special. A story about a stripper... OK, here it goes.The film revolves around Erin Grant, a former FBI secretary, who loses custody of her young daughter Angela to her ex-husband Darrell. In order to afford an appeal, Erin becomes a stripper at the Eager Beaver, a Miami strip club. A Congressman named David Dilbeck visits the club and immediately begins to adore Grant. Aware of Dilbeck's embarrassing indulgences, another Eager Beaver patron approaches Erin with a plan to manipulate the Congressman to settle the custody dispute in Erin's favor. However, Dilbeck has powerful business connections who want to ensure he remains in office. Consequently, those who can embarrass him in an election are murdered. Meanwhile, Erin retrieves her daughter from her negligent husband. Dilbeck's personal interest in Erin persists, and she is invited to perform privately for him. He asks her to become his lover and later his wife, despite his staff's concerns that she knows too much information. A debate occurs as to whether to kill Erin or simply keep her quiet by threatening to take away her daughter.Demi is alright in the movie, if even that, I'm being pretty generous considering she let her daughter, Rumor, act as her daughter in this movie. If I were Rumor, I'd be like ""next time, I pick the mother/daughter bonding event"". I wouldn't really feel like watching my mother dance around naked for men nore a camera. Well Rumor must have gotten a huge raise in her allowance for that to happen.

21,callanvass,An unwatchable mess,1,11 November 2013,"This is the film that got Demi Moore into a bit of a downward spiral. She's still relevant, but her acting career was never quite the same. The problem with this film is that it doesn't fully know what it wants to be. It tries to have the best of both worlds with action & comedy, but it doesn't work with this movie. The action is not exciting, and the laughs come across as unfunny and desperate. The only time I was remotely interested in this movie is when Demi Moore does her strip scenes. She's got such an amazing body that I became jealous of one of my favorite actors (Bruce Willis) because he used to be married to that gorgeous woman. It tries to throw in cheap sentiment with a custody battle, involving Demi's daughter in this movie (played by her real life daughter, Rumer Willis) to no avail. A lot of the time I end up liking films that are verbally thrashed much more than others do, but this deserves all of the bad reviews it gets. Demi Moore tries her hardest, but her beauty isn't enough to make this movie interesting. I really did try to come up with reasons to care about her, but I couldn't do so. It's not her fault that she's in such a horrible movie. Burt Reynolds embarrasses himself in this movie. He wears an awful blonde wig, and has a poor accent too boot. Ostensibly, he wanted this part very badly, according to IMDb trivia. I get that his star power was nowhere near what it once was, but come on, Burt! Armand Assante smokes a lot of cigars, and doesn't make much of an impression. Rhames, Patrick, and others do what they have to do adequately, but they can't do much with the script. The ending might involve the most cocaine I've ever seen on filmFinal Thoughts: Save yourself the trouble, and avoid it. It's bad enough to begin with, and it's almost two hours.

22,ironhorse_iv,"If you strip away the bare sex appeal of Demi Moore from this movie. It really does expose, how unfunny, this movie is.",4,16 June 2016,"While this movie was pretty known in the 1990s, for being one of the several movies where Demi Moore appears topless, it's probably more memorable, today for having been panned by the critics and winning several Razzie Awards, including ""Worst Picture of 1996"" than anything else. After all, not a lot of Millennials, might know, who Demi Moore is, since she pretty much, barely acts, these days. Directed, produced, and written by Andrew Bergman, Striptease tells the story of Erin Grant (Demi Moore), former FBI secretary/single mother who has turned to stripping to earn enough money to gain legal custody of her young daughter, Angela (Rumer Willis), while also finding herself, matching wits with a lustful United States Congressman, David Dillbeck (Burt Reynolds), and his powerful corporate backer, Malcolm Moldowsky (Paul Guilfoyle) in order to get her job back with the FBI. Without spoiling the movie, too much, I have to say, the movie is somewhat directionless. It doesn't know, if it wants to be, a political thriller, or a sex comedy. There were a lot of pointless scenes that really goes, nowhere that weren't exciting, nor funny. If that wasn't bad, enough, the plot for this movie doesn't make much logic in real-world sense. Honestly, what type of a judge, allows a criminal with a record, visitation rights, much less sole custody, because the other one is a stripper? I get that, the book explains it by saying that the local cops buried Erin's ex-husband, Darrell (Robert Patrick)'s record when he agreed to be an informant, however, that probably wouldn't happen in real life as well. I have to say, there is a huge difference, between the film version of 'Striptease' and the 1993 novel of the same name, by Carl Hiaasen, as well, despite some critics, playing the screenplay is pretty faithful to the book, which it is not. One of the biggest difference is that, the environmental message has been left out. There is little to no mention of the subplot about the plutocracy of sugar growers in Florida, and the exorbitant subsidies regularly granted to them by the U.S. Congress. Another big change that the film did, is how a lot of supporting characters of the novels were either demoted to nameless cameos, or cut from the film, all together. A good example of this, is the character, Joyce Mizner, who played, a semi big part, as the fiancée of the man, Dilbeck attacks, but as of my knowledge, doesn't appear in the film. Honestly, whatever, did happen to her? Another change from the novel, is what happen to Erin's ex-husband, Darrell toward the end. I get that, there were concerns that the ending of the film, being too dark, not comical enough; but all of these rewrites and reshoots, did nothing, but cause delays & make the ending, somewhat anticlimax. It wasn't good. I get that, audience didn't want, Burt Reynolds to be, a violent villain, but how can, Reynolds show that he is a good actor, if he only plays over the top comical characters. It really does limited his acting range and somewhat typecast him. Because of that, I really couldn't get behind, this cartoony Congressman character, at all. It was really, nothing new from the actor. Not only that, but his character does a lot of annoying, and somewhat too gross & pervy things, I really didn't want to see. All of the jokes, with him, really does fall flat. It was a little too, much for me to take, much like Robert Patrick's character, who I also easily equally dislike. Honestly, if there was one character, that I somewhat like, from this film, it has to be the bouncer, Shad (Ving Rhames). While Ving Rhames's acting is mediocre, at best, with his stone-cold expression. At least, he's one of the only actors in the film, that didn't make a fool of themselves, along with the other, being Paul Guilfoyle & Armand Assante as FBI agent, Al Garcia. Then, there is Demi Moore, whom dour acting in this, is mostly meh. It's just so jarring and awkward to see, her single-parent plot, be, taken so serious, compare everything else. It felt like too different types of movies, here, being mixed together. Maybe, if she had more flair, it could had help the movie, but it really wouldn't matter. Her character was so badly written, so I can't say, she's the worst thing about this film, because she's clearly not. Her sex appeal is the only one that keeps this movie from falling apart and somewhat marketable. Still, Demi Moore kinda ruin movie's much-advertised nudity and eroticism, by promoting this film, looking like a masculine butch than a femme woman. I get that, she was filming 1997's 'G.I Jane' at the time. However, her muscle bound frame and bald head were really distracting, and made people, more interested in finding out, what 'G.I Jane' was about, than what 'Striptease' was telling us. No wonder, why this movie failed at the box office. It also didn't help that this film was association with the previous year's film about nude dancers, 1995's 'Showgirls'. Both films were highly criticize, for its sleazy premise, and because of that, some critics were a little too judgmental on the subject matter. In my opinion, I don't think the movie is the worst. The stripteases sequence are choreographed to present the strippers as seasoned pros, indifferent to their nudity and disdainful of their customers. However, due to the awkward humor and somewhat unlikeable characters. I can somewhat agree. This film is not good. It's a movie in limbo.",Striptease

Well, the plot is terrible and there are monumental mistakes and goofs but Demi looks at her best and delivers a raunchy, almost comical performance. Burt Reynolds is a joke in this movie.

Getting over that very raunchy, commercial, and flamboyant Verhoeven effort, Showgirls the year before, the strip show circuit, is thrown back in our faces again, where what we have here, instead, is a story, only this movie is less captivating, or enticing. Fighting for custody of her daughter, against her white trash alcoholic ex, (Patrick in one of his best performances) our hot Demi, such eye candy in black lingerie, goes back to what she does best, stripping, so she can earn enough to get herself a good lawyer and have permanent custody of her angel. This only scratches the surface of the story, involving murder, of an overweight, drooling customer, who tries to help Demi out of her pickle, bringing the attention of a good natured cop (Assante very good, but wasted here). After all the body, practically landed on Assante's doorstep. Of course the scene stealer is Burt, as a crooked congressman, who really has a kinky side to him, sporting different disguises when he frequents strips clubs. But we all have our kinks. His performance can be seen as terrible, or terribly great if you can grasp that concept. It's sad he got a Stinker award, whatever as this character is the furtherest from Burt, we've ever seen, as he's not Burt. Demi does really work the stage well though, like a pro, and we almost see all of Demi. She's As an actress here, though, she's done better, Disclosure, solid evidence of that. We too have a hot stripper actress from Showgirls, as well as other hotties. We have a really cute and funny, chimpanzee, could be the same one from Monkey Trouble, for all I know.

In order to get her back, Erin would stoop to work at a strip club. During the time, a Congressman(Burt Reynolds) catches his eye on Erin and takes a high interest in her. Another patron at the club wants to help Erin get her daughter back. But he knows what kind of a person the congressman is, and is later killed. Erin does get her daughter back, since the judge who remanded to the ex died of natural causes, she couldn't wait months to get her back, and the ex is very negligent. When Shad(Ving Rhames) the bouncer hears about all this, he would jump into action to make sure that she gets her daughter back. This movie is raw and highly impactive. Good star quality. Demi Moore does her character well. Her dancing and strip skills are top notch. Her daughter Rumer is very nice in her role. At the mother/daughter remain intact. It was a fine movie.

29,NateWatchesCoolMovies,Slight fun,7,11 January 2016,"The 90's saw a lot of comedic fluff come and go, some memorable, others not so much, and some nestled in that perfect, laid back place just between. Striptease falls into that category; it's not that eventful, but provides an enjoyable diversion with the help of a cast that's clearly having fun, and a reliably solid lead performance from the always fantastic Demi Moore. Here she plays a stripper doing her vest to raise her young daughter (Rumer Willis, Demi's real life daughter with Bruce Willis) right without much money or help. Moore is gifted in the fact that she can play the nastiest chicks just as proficiently as the more innocent good girls, and every area of gray in between. Here she's clearly got a good heart and has been obligated to enter her line of work trough her devotion to her daughter. That and it makes for a sexy character quirk to keep audiences perked. She's also attempting to avoid her deadbeat, dim bulb ex husband Daryl (Robert Patrick) who steals wheelchairs and sells them lol. She gets caught up in a dangerous blackmailing situation when a cheerfully alcoholic congressman (Burt Reynolds) takes a shine to her one night, and is forced to turn to sympathetic cop Al Garcia (Armand Assante) and bodyguard Shad (Ving Rhames) for help. It's slight, breezy stuff and although it's not the greatest movie, I was charmed by Demi and the happy go lucky tone that it keeps up. Having her real daughter in the film also really strengthens their scenes with a dynamic that you wouldn't otherwise get.",Striptease

As a comedy/drama this one misfires most of the way, being especially impotent on the dramatic side. But of course ""Striptease"" (a mis-title) was promoted as just that, titillation in the form of one Demi Moore. The lovely Mrs. Willis has been working out to obtain the body that she flashes for around a minute all up on screen.While Moore uses her looks to full effect (male fans won't be disappointed), her considerable acting talents (which began to show promise in ""A Few Good Men"" and ""Disclosure"") are nowhere to be seen here.Bergman's script - adapted from a novel - manages some timely humour along the way, but it is otherwise flat and silly, while his direction is uninspired. Resurrection of this near flop is left to a couple of comically enjoyable turns from two of the support cast. Ving Rhames, who really does get better and better, seems to be able to make something from almost anything, and he delivers a very funny turn here as an ""Eager Beaver"" bouncer. Robert Patrick gives the film's other hilarious showing as the nutty ex-husband who it seems will go to great lengths to stop his former wife (Demi Moore) from gaining custody of their daughter (played by real life daughter of Bruce Willis and Demi Moore, Rumer). Other support comes from Burt Reynolds and Armand Assante.""Striptease"" completely fails at being a thoughtful drama about child custody and women fighting for themselves, but comically it has its moments.

31,TheFearmakers,Makes Showgirls seem like The Godfather,1,24 January 2021,"""It will never happen again"" is the last line in STRIPTEASE, a flimsy exploitation with a single promise - to feature the world's then top actress a topless scene and beyond, with a record breaking payday attached... And Demi Moore's character was right... No one asked for a sequel.Making SHOWGIRLS seem like PULP FICTION, with so many flaws it's difficult to know where to begin... So how about the beginning: Perhaps one of the worst pre opening credit sequences of all time, beating out Wilfred Brimley appearing on his grandson's television set in COCOON 2...In STRIPTEASE we kickstart inside a courtroom where Demi Moore's single mom Erin Grant tells the judge everything we need to know, a case of exposition dialogue gone haywire: Her cheating loser husband got her fired as an FBI secretary, and she lost custody of her daughter... And following the credits we cut directly to our heroine stripping at a high-end dance club - no setup, no progression, nothing... Just the matter at hand, and what half the audience paid to see.In the flesh, Demi looks fantastic, a bronze goddess making up for what was hardly distinguishable in BLAME IT ON RIO years earlier... Her strobe-lit numbers are reminiscent of FLASHDANCE choreography: Erin is not only head over heels above the other strippers, she's sought out by a Right Wing politician who loves naked ladies and Family Values, and could be involved with murder...Burt Reynolds, as Congressman David Dilbeck, trying for a comeback that he'd garner in his Oscar nominated BOOGIE NIGHTS performance a year later, plays someone so clownish he needed only makeup and a honking nose. Which would have made him a lot funnier. Attempting to do what a Charles Durning type character actor would pull off without going overboard, Burt fails at every possible turn.And another wasted player plays it the most mellow and subtle, and still bombs out, in Ving Rhames as Shad, the dance club's heart of gold bouncer who is a tough, awkward oddball - these same traits summing up the entire viewing experience: In attempting a commercialized mainstream setting within a risque subject, no genre benefits: STRIPTEASE is never quite sure to be a working class dramedy, a lightweight crime thriller, a political satire, a modern exploitation or romantic comedy...Enter investigating cop Armand Assante who, being a faithful husband, doesn't amount to a possible or even peripheral love interest while Demi Moore is simply collecting that paycheck, having zero chemistry with her main motivation serving as the plot's McGuffin: real life daughter Rumor Willis, with a one-note expression throughout, is excruciatingly out of place.Yet the grand prize for worst performance goes to another capable actor who, like Burt and everyone else, should have known and acted better: TERMINATOR 2 arch villain Robert Patrick, as Erin's no-good white trash husband seeming part of a Happy Madison vehicle, takes the cake and eats it too. And you'll hear a lot about how awful SHOWGIRLS is.That's because it's unintentionally hilarious, timeless and memorable, and wonderfully classic, campy and perfect. But this uneven catastrophe, providing torture without tickles, has no camp value whatsoever. And any bad movie lacking cult status is a forgotten footnote in cinematic purgatory: a suitable place for STRIPTEASE to reside.",Striptease
32,triple8,a bit better the 2nd time around but can't TOUCH the book.,6,9 May 2004,"The first time I saw striptease, I rated it a 4. Now, having seen it again, I admit it's a bit better the 2nd time around-maybe a 5 or 6 but no more. My main problem is still the same-it just isn't half as funny as the book. And without that incredible humor, the movie didn't have a chance.I did enjoy the perfectly cast Ving Rhames as Shad and Burt Reynolds breathed life into the bumbling congressman. But while there were a few funny lines, the movie didn't wear comedy well. It kept switching back and forth from a comedy to a soap opera. Demi Moore while as beautiful as ever didn't stand out to me in this role, they maybe should have gone with an unknown actress. I also think the strip dance scenes weren't sexy. There was this almoast desperate quality coming from the movie: like ""here's Demi-everybody drool"". I thought it was a bit over the top.And that's just the problem-the story which WAS over the top worked as a book-here it didn't work quite as well, certain things that happened just seemed ridiculous. Without the tongue in cheek humor that made me absolutely LOVE this book, the story was lost and became-almost ordinary.Anybody who has read the book knows how marvelous this could have been, I actually believe it could have been a classic. As I mentioned, there were a bit more positives this time around,the MALE characters were better then the female and certain lines and scenes did work a bit better when I saw it a second time. But knowing what a 10 this movie could have been, it's kind of sad. I can't put my finger on exactly WHAT fell flat but as mentioned, the best I can say is the movie should have taken itself less seriously and focused more on the comedy-there was a real lot of comedy in the book to focus on!-it's tough to do a hilarious satire like movie and also make it a mini soap opera. The movie didn't quite pull it off but the strong casting of the male leads sure helped. 5 or 6 out of 10.",Striptease
33,Spleen,What was the POINT?,3,5 August 1999,"I've never been inside a strip joint.  I don't know what they're like. I'll wager, though, that there's a fair amount of variety - whereas it looks as if Hollywood uses the very same place for reference in every movie in which strippers appear.  It must be doing great business.  That damned fireman's pole at the front of the stage - what, is it holding the roof up?  Why do the dancers perform on a poorly-lit stage with a strobe lamp going off? Has it occurred to anyone that the audience might want to get a good look at things?  And why is the predominant colour an unappealing blue?  Surely ALL strip joints aren't like that.  Let's hope not, anyway.Do you want to see bare breasts?  Forget it.  Some powerful person behind the scenes clearly belongs to a splinter religious sect and believes that nipples are evil, and so they've carefully choreographed even the backstage scenes in order to prevent us from seeing one.  This sort of thing I would object to in a disinterested way even if I weren't a heterosexual male. It just looks silly.  It looks silly when people have sex wearing boxer shorts; silly when people pour detergent into their baths and hide under the foam so that the camera can't see their naughty bits; and sillier still when the action is set in, say, a strip joint.  If they really want to be so self-consciously coy they could have rewritten the story ever so slightly and made Demi Moore work for, say, a greengrocer.  (The movie would have been no duller and a good deal more honest.)  But AS a heterosexual male, dammit, I wanted to see tits.  (And NOT just Demi Moore's.)  Is that too much to ask?  Failing that I would have settled for an interesting story or witty dialogue or any one of a hundred other things that were also absent.

34,Galina_movie_fan,Good or bad? Funny or ridiculous? Misunderstood satirical masterpiece or...,5,12 August 2005,"...the flop that deserves six of its Razzies and the nomination for Worst Picture of the Decade?I think, ""Striptease"" (1996) directed by Andrew Bergman based on the book by Carl Hiaasen, is all of the above - a curious mixture of laughs, satire, absurdism, darkness, silliness, and over-seriousness. The latter comes from Demi Moore who plays Erin Grant, the FBI secretary - losing her job and the custody over her daughter to no good small time crook wheelchairs stealing husband (Robert Patrick looking and acting like a stoned, redneck version of Gary Oldman) and who takes a job as an exotic dancer in the local club ""Eager Beaver"" to earn money for her court appeal. In the club she becomes the hottest attraction and meets many...interesting characters, the most colorful being, of course Congressman David Dilbeck (Burt Reynolds) who ""just loves naked women. It's a character flaw"" and who is absolutely smitten by Erin. Erin also makes friends with a club bouncer, Shad (Ving Rhames) who is perhaps the best thing in the movie - clever, sharp, sarcastic, with the great sense of humor. One scene where Shad tells to Dilbeck's bodyguards that Meryl Streep used to work in ""Eager Beaver"" as an exotic dancer and they seem to believe him is brilliant. If only everything had been as good as he was we would've had a really great movie. What do we have now? Well, Demi Moore looks really good with the minimum clothes on. I mean, the woman was a 33 year old mother of three at the time and her body was marvel to behold. I just think that she was too serious, intense, and solemn doing the striptease numbers  after all it is not only strip it is tease, too. It goes to her acting in the movie in general. Reynolds seemed to have a lot of fun with his sleazy drunk Congressman David Dilbeck, election-day choice of Christian groups and a lot of laughs comes from his mannerism and quotes. There are plenty of laughs, actually, in ""Striptease"" but quite often they seem like the wrong and unintentional type for the movie material. Who had the best laugh? I'd guess, Demi Moore did after been paid $12.5 million  one of the highest paychecks for an actress back then.",Striptease

36,PredragReviews,Howard Shore Soundtrack Rocks!!,7,8 May 2016,"I have enjoyed this movie ever since I first viewed it. And the main reason is Demi Moore. She has obviously done her homework and her dancing is quite literally, stunning. She is truly superb as one of the sleazy nightclub pole dancers and I appreciate an actor who has taken the time to experience the real thing and then gets it spot on when required. Some of the support cast leave things to be desired. Moore's estranged husband is not the best drunk/drugged I've ever seen and Bert Reynolds portrayal of the congressman couldn't have been more hammed up if the producers had tried. Demi learned to dance like an exotic dancer for this film and after just having a baby at the time, she looks great.And even with an indifferent script, Moore holds it all together so as not to allow these annoyances to ruin this otherwise enjoyable comedy/drama.The story was hugely predictable, and the acting was pretty bad, but this movie was really funny. There were some great one-liners. If you are a fan of Demi Moore, then you will recall her dancing to two terrific Lennox tunes, ""Money Can't Buy It"" and ""Little Bird."" These tunes marked the clear highlight of the film, but mysteriously are missing here, along with another haunting Lennox song titled ""Cold"" which can be found on the album Diva along with the other two missing songs. Overall, a pretty good movie with Moore's ""chair dance"" being one of the most sensual acts I have seen in a long time! Overall rating: 7 out of 10.",Striptease

The mix really doesn't work, and the clash between Demi Moore's overly serious acting and Burt Reynolds' whatever the hell Burt Reynolds was doing couldn't be more off-putting. The boat scenes, dear God the boat scenes, the memory just won't go away. That's what I call nightmare fuel. Robert Patrick and Ving Rhames are also in this movie, which I guess makes it a bit cooler than it deserves to be. Their characters aren't interesting in the slightest, but hey, they're still Robert Patrick and Ving Rhames. As well as pretty much every other aspect from this weak, overlong movie, I really hated the climax. If that's the best solution you can come up with, you might want to consider not making movies.

It's actually got a lot of funny bits in it, and Burt Reynolds, Ving Rhames, and Armand Assante provide solid support for Demi Moore. Frankly, the real-life strippers brought in as extras were a bit better dancers than Demi, but Demi has absolutely nothing to be ashamed of here, at least as far as I'm concerned--she did a great job of showing with the pros. But then, like I said, I have a pretty low character. I just got a kick out of this ""so wrong"" movie, and it reminded me of when I didn't have to worry about everything I said everywhere I went.

40,The_Movie_Cat,Silicon Silly Con,4,24 January 2000,"Ultimately, for a film called Striptease, this contains very little disrobing of any kind. It completely defies the expectations  and requirements  of it's audience by having Demi clothed for the majority of the duration, and it shoots it's bolt early by having Moore strip within the first twenty minutes. Moore reportedly met several strippers  or `dancers' as they're respectful known here  and doubtlessly asked for a sensitive portrayal to avoid causing offence. To this end, we have a very supportive, `sisterhood' of erotic dancers who are togetherness and praise. The bitchiness and snide competitiveness that you would expect in such an institution is absent (apart from a humorous scene where one girl accuses another of having a beard) and the stripping elements are toned down almost to the point of non-existence. In their place are fitted a very ropy `comedy-thriller'. Too silly to be a thriller, and yet not funny enough to be a comedy, it satisfies neither convention and flounders nowhere in between. Direction can be occasionally rewarding, such as the shot taken from inside a washing machine, and Moore plays it admirably straight. Ving Rhames and Armand Assante do well in their respective roles, though Rhames is essentially portraying a black stereotype.  Burt Reynolds, meanwhile, is lousily over the top as a libidinous congressman in a misfiring b-plot that attempts satire, yet never hits the mark. Is this really the same actor that was so effective in Boogie Nights?Striptease employed three dialogue editors, an amazing fact given that the script isn't exactly Shakespearean. However, Striptease can at least be commended for having a beginning, middle and end. The film also deserves praise for exploring it's subject without unnecessary exploitation. Topless shots of Moore are kept to a minimum, while she keeps her briefs on the whole time despite the nature of the job. It's just a shame about that blasted monkey.",Striptease

The actors, except the main one which is OK, do an average job, consolidating the overall low-budget feel of this movie. As upsides, it is very sensual, the main character being a stripper at a famous club, and funny through the characters' stupidity.

42,AngelHonesty,Good for What it Is,8,5 August 2021,"I was surprised at the low rating for this film. It made me hesitate before watching, but I was happy I decided to see it. I think the real question is, what are you expecting to get out of this film? Demi Moore plays the strong lead of Erin Grant who is a stripper trying to take her daughter back from her criminal husband. The movie is filled with hot sexy strippers who dance away to the crowed, Demi Moore is gorgeous as she proudly shows off her body when she strips and dances. The film is full of eye candy with a splash of comedy as it makes fun of the US senator and his sexual idiocy. The storyline is nothing deep or impressive and perhaps the movie is a little drawn out for the simplicity of it. But it's funny how they mock the senator and there is lots of eyes candy with the stripers. The main goal of the film is naked woman dancing and they defiantly succeeded with that.",Striptease

All characters are surviving in a grim world. Fortunately the director lets the actors breathe and the music lets the atmosphere live. In the end, the audience gets a casserole of film elements and little of the satisfaction that comes from watching these types of movies. Formulaic, cheesy b-fun emerges.

46,SKG-2,It's not as bad as they say...it's WORSE!!!,1,22 September 1999,"Two amazing things about this movie; no, make that three:(1) That Carl Hiaasen actually liked the adaptation of his hilarious novel.  Hiaasen is still one of the funniest writers around(if you read STRIPTEASE and liked it, I highly recommend all of the other novels he wrote by himself), but this proves his taste is questionable.  This movie, unlike the novel, is painfully unfunny.  There are occasional good lines from the novel(like when Ving Rhames(the only good actor here, along with Demi Moore's daughter Rumer Willis) telling two security guards that Meryl Streep used to strip under the name Chesty LeFrance), and even a couple of original ones(like Moore refusing to dance with cream corn because she doesn't want it to go up her ""hoo-ha""), but the motivations, the characters, and the story are all hacked away; (2) that Andrew Bergman is responsible for this mess.  After all, from his track record as writer(THE IN-LAWS, FLETCH, co-writer of SOAPDISH) and director(THE FRESHMAN, HONEYMOON IN VEGAS(both of which he also wrote), IT COULD HAPPEN TO YOU), you'd think this was someone who knows funny.  But he goes so wrong here it's unbelievable.  Typical is the scene where Burt Reynolds character, who we know is a lech, delivers a sermon on ""family values.""  Did Bergman think he was actually breaking new ground here? Contrast that to a similar scene in the book, where we hear(though don't see) his character deliver an off-the-cuff speech on Israel which works precisely because he's feeling horny.  This is funny.  What's in the movie isn't; (3) That Demi Moore keeps appearing in novel adaptations when she apparently doesn't understand what made the source work.  This is the third novel adaptation(THE SCARLET LETTER, THE JUROR) in a row she appeared in, and they were all awful adaptations of fine books.  Okay, I'm not a big fan of hers, but she's done good work(G.I. JANE, IF THESE WALLS COULD TALK), and this isn't it.",Striptease
47,rajatdahiyax,Much More than a strip movie!!,7,19 August 2014,"Based on Carl Hiaasen's satirical novel, Striptease tells the story of Erin (Demi Moore), who has just gotten a divorce from Darrell (Robert Patrick), the sleazy ex-con she foolishly married. However, the judge's memories of Darrell's days as a football hero win him custody of their daughter, and Erin, concerned for her child's safety, is determined to fight the decision. Erin has just lost her position as a secretary for the FBI, so, to cover her legal bills, she takes a job as an exotic dancer at a strip club called the Eager Beaver. While she has no experience taking off her clothes in front of an audience, Erin soon makes friends with the fellow dancers and finds a protector in the club's burly but good-hearted bouncer, Shad (Ving Rhames). She also makes a few fans among the regulars at the club, most notably David Dillbeck (Burt Reynolds), a drunken lout with a bottomless appetite for sleaze -- who also happens to be a conservative congressman with ties to right-wing religious groups. One of Erin's admirers snaps a photo of her with the congressman when a brawl breaks out at the club, and he suggests that it would make fine blackmail material. However, when the man with the photo turns up dead, Erin discovers that Dillbeck's people play a bit rougher than she expected.",Striptease

An absolute fantastic performance from Burt Reynolds that had me laughing my socks off, every other character seems to just pale into the background. Moore shows more than she ever has, boy has she got amazing legs! The comedy really comes from Robert Patrick who plays Moores' husband who seems to get hurt at every opportunity, and when he meets Ving Rhames, his luck turns from bad to worse. The story is ridiculous with the ending adding strongly to that sentiment, but a strong performance from Reynolds certainly steals the show and categorically proves that he's still capable of out shining anyone.",Striptease

This was surprising for a couple of reasons: the first one being that I'd forgotten the film existed, the second being that I struggled to remember any details from it that would lead to me to feel strongly enough about it to say it was the worst movie I've seen.And so, for some reason, I opted to watch this again. As I suspected, it was a waste of my time that achieved nothing of any value and took the cumulative total of minutes this film took away from me that I will never ever get back to 234. I can only assume director Andrew Bergman met Satan at an abandoned fork of a road in the deep south for this one to bring in $113 million world wide.Striptease is not good, not at all. The performances are bizarre, the script is not funny or sexy and even the soundtrack just doesn't fit. Demi Moore seems to have got her money's worth on highly publicized breast implants and is in fine physical condition, but still somehow unwatchable. Having said that though, this is no trainwreck. The actors all know what they're doing. The scenes are all strung together in a coherent narrative. This may not be any good, but it isn't incompetent either, and that makes things even worse.At the end of the day, unless you have a Demi Moore fetish, you will remember nothing about this movie. You'll forget that Burt Reynolds or Robert Patrick are in it. You'll forget that Moore's character had a child. In time you will forget the film exists. It's simply not bad enough to be entertaining or memorable, or worthy of any thought, positive or negative. And that is the film's biggest crime.

She lands herself in trouble after a politician takes interest in her and gets her entangled in a murder mystery.Striptease is not perfect by any stretch of the imagination. Although, it is a highly entertaining film with funny side-characters, amusing subplots, and some genuinely heartfelt moments scattered throughout. The film's issues lie within the direction, with the source material is trying to make it dark, Bergman is trying to make it silly and Moore is trying to make it serious. The film somewhat hap-hazardously jumps between comedy and drama that doesn't always feel natural. Though Moore looks great as the lead, it's Reynolds who keeps the film comedic and light with his wacky performance. Although the movie has issues, it's oddball humour and a likeable cast keep it entertaining.",Striptease
54,patriciogl10,"Just enjoy it for what it is, a fun movie. And Demi's phenomenal physique!",8,20 August 2018,"If you're anything like me, you probably came across this movie with no one in mind other than Demi Moore, but ended up also being entertained by the likes of Burt Reynolds, Robert Patrick and Ving Rhames. I read many reviews that just thrash this movie because it's nothing like the book it is based upon and I wonder, is that ALWAYS necessary? Should that be the case for every single movie adapted from a book? I think that on many occasions writers and filmmakers are allowed to give their own spins and turns to the material they are working with. Having said that, I think that many reviewers couldn't get passed that and never saw this film for its own merit. It is a decent effort and nowhere near as bad as some are trying to make it out to be. Striptease is an interesting blend of dark humour and a fairly dramatic tone that, while it doesn't try to be one or the other, it merely seeks to find the right balance between them. 
Demi Moore plays a single mother who is an exotic dancer and at the beginning of the film she loses custody of her daughter to her sleazy husband, who seems to make things really difficult for her. She works at the Eager Beaver stripclub and her main interest during the entire movie is to get her daughter back. Burt Reynolds plays the congressman David Dilbeck who becomes infatuated with Moore's character, Erin Grant and he does so seeming quite clownish and somewhat cartoonish at times but never stops being light-hearted in every scene he's in. Ving Rhames plays the club Eager Beaver's bouncer Shad and does a phenomenal job, juxtaposing his expression of over-seriousness in his face with clever sarcastic remarks. Demi Moore delivers, in the sense that you feel her character is divided between earning money by dancing and feeling guilty for having been seen dancing by her daughter which she conveys the discomfort in one particular scene. And if you came to watch a movie called Striptease starring Demi Moore and hoped to catch a glimpse of her stripping and her other-wordly half-naked body, you will most definitely not be disappointed! She's got a sculptural body that will leave you standing watching in awe, whether you're a man or a woman. And on top of all that, you got a fun movie! What more could you possibly want?

58,MF210,Mixed Results,5,18 December 2003,"My Rating: ** out of ****. Striptease was massacred by critics and given six razzie awards. But I believe is that its nowhere near as bad as critics and movie fans say it is. I will admit this is not a good movie but it does have some good moments to it. Demi Moore was awarded a razzie for her performance. Even though I am not a fan of Miss Moore, her performance was not worth a razzie. She was ok in this role. In the dramatic scenes, she was not particularly good. This damages the movie a bit and you wonder what it would have been like with a better actress. However, I cannot believe Burt Reynolds did not win a razzie. His performance was a complete backfire. If he was trying to be funny, than this performance was a failure. Actually, I do not know what the hell he was going for here. The Supporting Cast is actually quite good. Ving Rhames gets all the good lines and delivers them perfectly. Armand Assante was solid in his role. Robert Patrick adds a little more comic relief. Rumer Willis actually shows some potential here. However, once you look by the supporting cast and a couple of funny moments, the movie does not have enough going for it. Yes, Demi Moore looks good when shes stripping but like I said she is not good when she has to act in a dramatic scene. Striptease is trying to be a comedy, drama, thriller, and with a little erotic flavor. It has moments of comedy and is somewhat erotic at times but it is not particularly thrilling. It seems to go on a little too long. Overall, Striptease is at times entertaining and some of the supporting cast, Particulary Rhames, is almost worth seeing it for. But the movie is lacking many things that do not quite make it good.",Striptease

Demi Moore is outstanding as a newcomer to the ""Eager Beaver"", a raunchy strip club where she does a more than adequate job of raising pulses whileVing Rhames watches over her as self-appointed guardian(he's great as usual), and Burt Reynolds has never been funnier as a U.S.Congressman that would make Bill Clinton proud!

So, the amount of nudity seems a little misplaced here, for it is not enjoyable for adults in this plot and not needed for the attraction of kids.

I also read somewhere that Demi Moore had ""artistic""(?) control over the character of Erin written into her contract; well, this is the result - a confused and toothless adaptation of a wonderfully raunchy (and *funny*) book.

It seems Demi Moore and Burt Reynolds are acting in two different pictures. Moore plays it fairly straight while Burt seems to be having the time of his life. The only really outstanding thing about this film is Pandora Peaks as Demi Moore's best friend (another stripper) who has the best set of tits seen on screen in a major release since Pamela Anderson. The film does not go far enough. It had all the elements to be a very edgy comic film but it falls completely flat (with the obvious exception of Pandora Peaks whose tits should have been given a lot more screen time than this movie provided).,Striptease

However it is certainly no achievement and doesn't deserve to be called `underrated'. A vote of 3.9 on IMDb at time of writing (3/2/00) sounds about right. The plot focuses on Demi Moore working as a stripper so she can get enough money to reclaim custody of her daughter from the hands of evil husband Robert Patrick. However sleazy Congressman Burt Reynolds (going incognito, but you can hardly blame him) falls for her and this sparks off events that lead to murder, which cop Armand Assante investigates. There are a good few laughs in here, such as Reynolds going to both Jewish and Christian fund raising events and covering himself with Vaseline. The film also contains solid performances from Ving Rhames as a tough but nice bouncer and the ever-excellent Assante. However the casting of Moore, who just isn't right for the role, dramatically or comically, fatally flaws Striptease. Director Andrew Bergman doesn't handle the film at all badly, but his script is a mess; failing to keep the courage of its convictions and unforgivably pulling its punches on the sleaze and satire. It just isn't funny enough, dramatic enough or compulsive enough to warrant more than a cursory viewing on television. For the record, Moore's (then) much hyped `assets' appear three times, but they like the rest of the film are strangely unerotic, probably because they look like the fake rubbery enhancements that they are. When the owner of the Eager Beaver confesses that he has been impotent ever since he opened the club, we can quite understand why.",Striptease

The stripping is awful, it is apparently heavily erotic - I didn't see anything erotic, the dancing is laughable, this has to be the most overrated erotic movie of all time. There is nothing, not a single relevant, serious, well choreographed erotic dance clip or sex scene. The story was turned into a very shallow script and the only thing that the directors cared about, was showing Demi Moore in a thong. Looking back, this is where Demi's career ended. This movie was so bad it evicted Demi from the movie industry that disabled her any opportunity for a serious role. Demi Moore will be remembered forever in Striptease, the woman who showed a few bits of her butt in embarrassing fashion. There's no substance, no intrigue, no real insight, no drama, if they wanted to do a sexually orientated movie, then they should have waived the rights to Hustler to make a porno movie.

Not sure if the Florida State Tourism authorities would have him on their Christmas card list, but that's bureaucracy for you - no sense of humour.The fourth thing. Ving Rhames. Shad is a well intentioned muscle in the book, and Ving does it close enough to the mark. Wouldn't argue with him, anyway.Third. Burt Reynolds. How can anyone forget the image of an excited Congressman in boots, hat, shorts, and little else, covered in Vaseline and sniffing a girl's clothes dryer lint. And the Hava Nagila scene. Come on, Burt was laughing at himself throughout. At least, I hope he was.And the final two. The immaculate Demi Moore dancing (no, better yet, stripping) to Annie Lennox / Eurhythmics tracks. I already loved Annie Lennox's entire persona and musical output, so good tracks at volume with Demi doing very good visuals is just about perfect. The best? - I thought the scene after her shower in the apartment.No, it's not going to be a film to snuggle down with your wife to (or maybe it is), nor is it a family film.

This movie was a cult comedy that had a great ending. Demi Moore marries a man who is addicted to pills. After having a daughter with this man, she loses her job as an FBI secretary, divorces him and loses custody of her daughter. So she fights to get her daughter back and to prove that he is trying to keep her from doing that. She is emotional but she is strong and angry and knows exactly what this man is about, hes a liar. Hes a thief and she isn't going to let it go. Sharing custody with her ex husband they fight with everything they have, finding a homicide detective to actually help her cause and get her daughter back. In the end thats exactly what she does. Getting custody and raising her daughter. Its a true story of a stripper fighting for what she knows is right. Fighting for what she knew she would want for her child.

The book pointed out that the ones degraded by stripping are actually the men, who turn into drooling, brainless fools, while the women have the control and collect the money.  The movie has to add a scene where the daughter sees the mother dancing (oh horrors!) and the mother has to explain her Sordid Living to the Innocent Babe.Also, in the book, Erin is a top dancer who doesn't have the biggest boobs in the room, but who gets the best tips because she actually knows how to dance.  So who do they get to play her?  Bebe Neuwirth?  Noooo.  Demi Moore. All tits and no dancing talent.Demi Moore was apparently determined to keep this movie from being seen as a comedy.

78,mhthehammer,Shame on you Castle Rock,2,28 May 2020,"Time to see more of Demi Moore (pun definitely intended) with the movie that started the nail on the coffin of her acting career, Striptease. Based on the book by Carl Hiaasen, the movie follows Erin Grant (Demi Moore) an FBI agent-turned stripper who's in the middle of a custody battle over her daughter (Rumer Willis) with the help of Lieutenant Al Garcia (Armand Assante). However, said battle requires a visit to Congressman David Dilbeck (Burt Reynolds) as she conjures a plan to remove him from office after one patron who volunteered as an insider was murdered. Unlike Showgirls, which was a drama and tries to take itself seriously, Striptease is a comedy with satirical jabs at corrupt Floridian politicians. The main problem with the film, however, is that the tone is all over the map, as it cannot decide whether to be funny or serious. That tonal shift might have been caused by Demi Moore, who knew too well about Erin and made her into a radical feminist who opposes her job. Meanwhile, she's surrounded by whacky comic minor characters like Shad the bouncer (Ving Rhimes) and her ex-husband Darrell (Robert Patrick). Part of me wanted to laugh because these minor characters from the book do deserve fit on the big screen, but when Erin's arc came, the movie fell apart. I swear, half the time, I kept wondering why she chose a cushy strip joint like the Eager Beaver instead of staying in the FBI. Despite Hiaasen's approval of the film adaptation, Striptease is a mess and did not live up to its potential as a hilarious political satire. (1 Shawshank Redemption Poster out of 5)",Striptease

Robert Patrick, Ving Rhames and Burt Reynolds performances stood out.

Yes, she can dance a bit, she has worked out, her face is fine - but to get millions for showing off her nonexistent acting skills, and her body - an accomplishment of plastic surgery - is just another proof that there's something seriously sick and disgusting in this world.
Burt Reynolds, Ving Rhames and Robert Patrick did understand that this was a satire, and executed well. Demi Moore was just so stiff and bland and unsexy it  ruined it.

I could relate to her very much. I had to go through a bad custody battle when my very abusive and religiously zealot, cultist ex-husband did everything he could to have me pistol whipped in the court. It eventually backfired, of course, but I was under so much scrutiny and he was under none. That was a double standard, discrimination and extremely unfair.But you will do anything for your kids and if I would have had the guts to, I may have done the same. With all the skills she had and all that she could offer any company or agency, but has no feasible choice but to work in a strip joint to earn the money for attorney's fees to get her daughter back and yet be a good mom and keep her self respect, dignity and deal with the stigma that goes with being one of ""them"" meaning the label that society has marked on women who do this for a variety of reasons, mostly because of their kids.

No one can ever say that Demi Moore is bad at anything; Ving Rhames always puts on a great performance; Robert Patrick, a excellent and gifted actor, Frances Fisher is a great talent. So, it is not like the cast was bad or they did a bad job. Burt Reynolds is the only one I don't care for both professionally and personally, but that is not to say that he was not good in her heyday.I believe that what people had a problem with is the subject matter because strippers are not suppose to have their kids, but addicts, drunks and convicts should, especially if the woman is a stripper.The character of ""Erin"" even said that she would have to find another job, a ""respectable"" job. Go figure. She was not a prostitute and even a prostitute can be a good mom.I thought the acting was quite good, but I have to agree, it could have been made a little better, such as it seemed as if the story line would go over in one direction and then suddenly get back on track.

85,doorbomb62,Ripley and Sarah Connor went to a strip club 10 yrs later...,5,18 January 2018,"Hollywood was on a roll after ALIENS which set the tone for 'Terminator 2: Judgement Day' and 'The Long Kiss Goodnight'. The common denominator being a mother, or in Ripley's case, the motherly figure, forced to take down a baddie whilst caring/nurturing their brood. Here' it's the Smart cop Mother who is taking off her clothes to close the case and all the while wanted to care for her daughter, portrayed quite nepotistically by Moore's eldest Rumor.It might seem an apple to ALIENS' orange, but when you look at the formulas...they're the same film more or less. What's even funnier is that this film never had a chance after following up another stripper picture...that of the over-the-top 'Showgirls' which was highly misdirected, but somewhat better on a scale of morale in which it was attempted to propel that feature. 'Striptease', on the other hand, offers nothing new, making it subpar. Perhaps if Demi Moore was busting out a machine gun in the 11th hour whilst in her sparkly bra and panties...it would have made for a much better sell. They could have even put little Rumor in her arm to the side like Ripley in the Poster of ALIENS. Film would have made at least 7 million more earning back it's budget.

Unfortunately in this case, it is the latter not the former.Demi Moore stars in this comedy (Comedy ??? excuse me, i forgot to laugh) playing a woman forced into stripping (um, pardon me... DANCING !) as her only means of financial support. Her deadbeat thief ex-husband has custody of her daughter and she desperately wants little Angela back.  Burt Reynolds plays a repugnant Congressman with his libido set on HYPER and has his heart and other parts of his anatomy set on capturing the lovely Ms. Moore.The Stripping scenes were at best mediocre, and they were, by far, the best part of the film. If they edited the movie down to a short 15 minute Stripdance by  Demi, it would be a marked improvement. The plot was typical of most murder mysteries but quickly lost its way and the ending was contrived and (unfortunately for a comedy)not humorous in the least. I can fully imagine that the film's money ran out and the necessity for a real ending was also discarded.Ving Rhames, playing the bouncer, was as always a pleasure to watch, i developed a true appreciation for his acting skills in ""Pulp Fiction"" (If your film needs a macho ""heavy"" call Ving.

Ironic really as the cost of her boob job would probably have paid for the custody battle.The central character of Erin is played by Demi Moore who seems to have taken the role to show off the talents of her plastic surgeon; but sadly displayed little talent of her own. This is the films major downfall as the other actors are fine (especially Burt), but Demi's character does not gain any particular sympathy as she is alternately intense, reproving, frowning, stern, serious and then back to intense again. ""Even with a great body you can be a serious actor"" she seems to be saying. In short, Demi was boring and I really did not care whether she won or not.Demi does have a great bod, but personally I find her strangely sexless and preferred any of the other women she worked with.

Demi Moore plays a mother who works in a striptease bar to raise money for a trial to get her daughter back from her criminal ex-husband. When a corrupt congressman becomes obsessed with her, misbehaves and is blackmailed, his political friends set out to kill everyone who endangers the reelection of their puppet. Demi Moore's character, as those of her allies, the formidable bouncer Shad and the clever and honest Police Lt. Al Garcia, are very likable and easy to identify with. Armand Assante as Al Garcia, and Ving Rhames as Shad, put in excellent performances as did most of the supporting cast, such as Stuart Pankin as dodgy lawyer, Robert Patrick as crazy ex-husband, or Paul Guilfoyle as sinister campaign manager. What I did not like, and which was consequently attacked in almost all reviews of this movie, are the actual striptease scenes. They are not sexy, are nothing but distractions, and should have been kept down to a minimum. Also, Demi Moore's acting performance, while not bad, is not on on a par with, for instance, Burt Reynold's.Speaking of Burt Reynolds: he is what makes this movie special. I challenge anyone to name a politician in movie history who is more corrupt or depraved than Reynold's character in this movie. Can there ever be a scene that more vividly portrays corrupt politics than when the congressman has to be dragged away by his handlers from his masturbation session to hold a speech to young Christians about family values?

Yeah, Demi Moore's performance as a stripper is a fascinating part in this movie for which she worked hard, but the movie is more deep than erotic scenes. The movie takes the books plot and makes it a bit more realistic and thoughtful by saying: stripper is not always equal with hooker, many times those girls are in desperate need of money, but keep their morals with them, being just dancers ; politicians sometimes are not what they appear to be, even if they are representing religious groups and as a overall lesson, don't label someone before you understand their story. The big reason why this movie is attacked from all sides is that it messes up (in a satiric way nevertheless) with sensible topics to fanatics who can't understand the reality beside their own opinion(politician are honest, religious people are pure and all people involved with the erotic world are sluts). În reality, there is no white and black, politicians are crooked, religious people are not so religious and strippers are not sleeping with people for money, we must accept the fact that the world is a mix full of shades of grey and the labelling is wrong. It's hard to put this movie in a genre, it has satire (dark comedy) , dramatic story (drama), some great action scenes with suspense (action and thriller), but I think that the idea was to tackle hard topics to reveal the reality and that's what I like about it.

106,IvanaCerveza,Nudity is not this movie's problem,3,4 November 2016,"This movie gets a lot of attention for being a mainstream film with an unusually high amount of nudity, yet nudity is the least notable aspect of the movie from a critical standpoint. With but a single exception, this movie's use of nudity is entirely appropriate to the subject matter: a strip club and its employees. Less nudity simply wouldn't make sense.The lone exception is a scene where Ms. Moore's character practices a stage routine at home after a shower. It turns awkward the moment she pulls panties on under cover of the towel she has wrapped around her body. Why the sudden modesty? She's clearly alone, the blinds are closed, and her comportment in the rest of the scene shows that she feels entirely secure in her person. Why not either a) drop the towel and pull on the panties, or just leave the towel on through the rest of the scene and skip the flashes of buns and boobs? There is either too much nudity in this scene or not enough. The movie makers tried to strike a balance between unnecessary titillation and a desire to keep their MPAA R rating, at a toll to believability.Contrast this with the backstage scenes, where the women re-dress shortly after coming off stage. We believe this. It's probably cold back there. They aren't going to hang around in their skin until it's time to go back on stage.The real problem with this movie is that it is nearly incoherent in its presentation. The style jerks madly between scary, slapstick, and serious. I'm all in favor of nuanced movies that don't fit into neat categories, but this movie doesn't blend them, it just butts mismatched scenes up against each other.It's clear that the movie's main character is not happy stripping for a living, but the sense we get from the movie is that this is because of the club's patrons, not from being nude, per se. One of the most telling scenes in the movie is when the main character's prepubescent daughter steals an illicit peek at her mother stripping and dancing on stage. When her mother learns of it, she is clearly upset by it, but why? Given the stage lights, all her daughter could have seen is the nudity, but it's clearly not nudity that's the problem here, only the audience's reaction to it. That leaves a huge hole in the social commentary this movie could be making, that the only problems needing to be fixed are the risks to the dancers.In the end, I find myself completely unchanged in my opinions about nudity, stripping as a profession, or the sleaze accompanying it. As a sermon, this movie entirely fails, where it had the opportunity to break new social ground.Then there are the scenes of violence mixed with comedy. It comes across not as black comedy, but as clowns stumbling drunkenly through a gang fight. It feels contrived, completely unrealistic. Violence and comedy can blend wonderfully: witness Quentin Tarantino's films. This film doesn't manage to pull that blend off at all.In the end, I give this movie 3 out of 10 because this movie failed to either achieve untethered fantasy or grounded reality. The only scenes that felt real are the exotic dancing scenes. It's 2016: if I want to see beautiful women peeling to their skin, I don't need to plow through 2 hours of incoherence to get it.I'm unlikely to watch this movie again.",Striptease

108,diamond_martini,It has it's moments,7,10 December 2006,"Come on guys, this movie wasn't all bad. Everyone has heard that book is great, and it was. Much like all Carl Hiaasen books. But the movie lacked the spice that the story had. So much was left out of the movie that it couldn't be anywhere near as good as anticipated. The only aspect of the movie that was portrayed well was of course Congressman Dilbeck (Burt Reynolds). I mean, smelling a strippers laundry lint while covered in vaseline right before giving a speech on family values? That's priceless! Demi Moore was... well, below average. As she is in most of her movies. Never the less, I do recommend this movie if your looking to only watch it once.",Striptease
109,catbird-2,A dreadful job from a terrific book.,1,23 January 1999,"Yes, I know that books aren't movies, and that faithful adaptations are not always possible or desirable.  But Hiaasen's book is eminently filmable: lots of plot, eccentric characters, blacker than black humor and very imaginative violence.Instead of filming *that,* this was a vehicle for the sexy-as-day-old-bread Demi Moore.  She's built, but as an actor ... she's built.  Ving Rhames and the marvelous Burt Reynolds are seldom seen, Demi preens and prances, and the comic violence which drives the book is almost all excised.  A pointless bore.",Striptease
110,outatime777,"Anyone who voted 10-7 on this movie has to be funny, right???",3,27 January 2004,"Demi thinks, I think, in this movie she's much more then she really trully is. Indecent Proposal awesome, this movie detracts from that. An actress/actor can truly diminish themselves from early work by taking on these types of parts. Did she need the money or the ego boost. Anyway, I didn't feel good about seeing the Ghost, IP, AFGM lead actress do this movie at all. Demi, not that you'll read this, but keep it real from know on....... I'm outta here, safe to all.",Striptease
111,RainColumbia,"really, a very funny movie",8,2 August 2003,"Hey, come on, guys - where's your sense of humor??  The movie is based on a book by Carl Hiassen, the master of comedy/thrillers set in southern Florida.  Demi Moore, Burt Reynolds and especially Ving Rhames bring the characters to life, and then some!  Doesn't seem realistic?  Have you seen John Sayles' ""Sunshine State""?  This is how the ""other half"" lives, believe it or not... And even not, it's a very funny film.  Demi deserves a lot of credit for taking on this quite challenging role.  She's got a great body, and more power to her!! May the best woman win!!  And she does!!!In addition, Burt Reynolds once again proves that he has a marvelous sense of comedy timing, character creation, and isn't afraid to make a fool of himself.  And Ving...., he's just marvelous. For a good time, rent ""Striptease"".  And bring along your friends.",Striptease
112,jkizer,Surprisingly average,6,11 September 2001,"I first saw this movie after reading about how absolutely horrible it was. However, I found it to be nothing more and nothing less than an average Hollywood film.  All of the characters (e.g. a person whose profession belies their inner character, a sleazy, womanizing politician) and plot devices have been seen before, but the characters are played well enough (especially Burt Reynolds' laughably lecherous Congressman Dilbeck) that the movie ends up being reasonably entertaining.",Striptease

114,cosmiquemuffin,Why the hating? It was fun!,7,21 January 2005,"It may not have mirrored the book, but it has its own charm. I haven't read the book, so maybe that's why I can judge the movie on its own merits.Ving Rhames is terrific-- honestly, has he ever had a clunker of a performance? Demi is luscious (the dance scenes, and the cute scene where she's getting dressed/dancing after a shower), and Burt Reynolds is hilarious. I really loved the congressman character meeting the right wing group slathered in vaseline. ""Fresh, hot, lint!"" indeed! Give it a whirl... it ain't Citizen Kane, but it ain't Battlefield Earth either.",Striptease
115,evoken89,Abuse,3,4 March 2012,"Good lord, this movie abuses every conceivable cliché possible. Imagine a movie about strippers. These strippers are different because they're naive, put upon, victims being forced to degrade themselves for icky men against their will. None of them are just whores or anything, and all of them, especially our heroine, have angelic hearts of gold. They are protected by large African American guardian ""Shad"". The plot centers around ""Erin"", played by Demi Moore, who was an FBI secretary until her husband's misbehavior got her fired and caused the dissolution of their marriage and an ensuing custody battle. The husband is not a great guy, as you can imagine, and takes their child, who is so un-important as a character that I can't remember her name, and engages in a wheelchair theft scam. Unable to win custody through legal means as a result of her occupation as a stripper, Erin illegally abducts the child. An elderly congressmen attempts to recruit Erin into his harem, using knowledge of the illegal abduction as leverage. You can pretty much use your imagination for everything that happens next. From here, the cliché abuse continues as it becomes a foregone conclusion that Erin is a near perfect mother and there is never any meaningfully developed conflict about her struggle raising a child given her choice of occupation. Just a stripper who's a great human being on the inside warring against her victimizers. The acting is horrendous, the characters are flat, the plot is predictable and contrived. And on top of this, despite being a movie about strippers, it was completely unsexy and un-arousing in any manner.The only thing that saves this from being a 1/10 are unintentionally comedic non-sequitors. The horrific and one dimensional portrayal of the congressman, for instance, crossed into strangely amusing territory at times, and something similar happens with Erin's ex-husband.",Striptease

117,iamkatiebubbles,I loved this movie and I'm not afraid to say so.,10,23 August 2005,"OKay, so it's a movie about a stripper... but I loved it and I don't care who knows it! I'm a huge Annie Lennox fan and Demi Moore was great dancing to her songs, she's a great actress and brought a touch of class to the stripper scene! (I'm not a lesbian by the way!) Basically I thought it was a great movie and can't see why most people think it's a dud... sure the storyline was a little unbelievable, but it wasn't taking itself seriously... the characters were all so different, all great in their own ways... I especially loved Ving Raymes character 'Shad' who was so hilarious... the whole movie was fun, energetic and overall in my opinion a great film... so stop the hating!!",Striptease
118,rufus-12,"Not sexy, hilarious",8,1 November 1998,"This movie was not what it was billed to be. The commercials, and even the listings billed it as an erotic drama. It was not that erotic. Demi Moore is made of plastic, and her dancing is not that great. This is, however, a great movie, what it should be based on the book. It is a comedy, with many hilarious moments, definitely worth seeing, whether or not you are into female nudity. Robert Patrick shines as does Ving Rhames. The only downside is Demi Moore herself, who can't tell a joke. Take a nap during her scenes, but laugh yourself silly during the rest.",Striptease
119,juan schwartz,Avoid like the plague,1,14 July 2000,"I don't care if Demi Moore was nude dancing beside me in the theater, that couldn't prevent me from walking out on this cheesefest!  How could Burt Reynolds even think about walking off the set of ""Boogie Nights"", yet think that this was a cherry role?  Heck, I would have even starred in ""Smokey and the Bandit 3"" before I would get near this sorry pile of vomit. Overall, it's the only movie I've ever walked out on and it will never be viewed by my eyes again.",Striptease
120,metallica_rocks-1,Senseless...but sexy,5,24 January 2008,"I think the movie isn't that bad, I mean, I think its fun to watch it, especially for men ;-)... I don't know the book, but I have to point out that the acting performance and the whole storyline is just a shame... After I watched the movie, I thought like ""Where is the sense in it?"" Ving Rhames is my favorite character, some kind of funny, but Reynolds? Just a weak performance, annoying, stupid and negative for his reputation I think... Anyway, visually really ""touching"", but the dialogues and the story just kills any serious possibility to watch this movie...5 points, because of demi moore's ""dancing"" skills...",Striptease
121,decthescouser,Fantastic.,10,25 July 2011,"Its just a straight up guy movie. No intricate plot. Just stripping. Demi Moore has an excellent body, considering she was a mother at the time, it's unbelievable. Yes, it's just a movie for perverted men, but that doesn't mean it can't be funny and worth watching. Ving Rhames plays his character well making him hilarious and interesting. I've only seen the original but it makes me wonder how much extra could be in the unrated version. Hopefully that'll be really worth a watch. Just from the title of the movie you keep waiting to see her perfectly sculpted body but you have to wait through a few strip scenes before you get to see her breasts.",Striptease
122,johnsydwaynest,Stripper defeats evil with a couple of adequate one-liners. Live with it.,10,19 June 2005,"It's funny! It's a movie about a stripper, are you really expecting it to be complicated and profound!? It's funny, it's fun,and it has enough to keep the general populace interested besides the stripping. Just let it be what it is, and you sure won't be disappointed, you'll probably even be impressed! :)Honestly, folks, it isn't supposed to be the Lord of the Rings, nor is it supposed to be the Godfather or Trois, or anything else amazing, if you even call those such. I don't, personally. Anyways, hope you enjoy, I don't think the movie's anything fandabulous, but I think we should look for things to see what they say, not expect them to say what we want. If any of you are waiting for that, go out and make your own movies! Heh. Seeya.",Striptease
123,buymorefansus,"Liked it, a revolution at the time for sure",8,10 August 2013,"Woa I remember when I thought this e-Striptease movie starring Demi Moore was trashy and obscene back then.... now it's actually more prude that the usual music video on MTV. Demi Moore gave her 100% in the stripper character and wasn't afraid of breaking new grounds and offending people in 1996. This is a recipe for success, just like Madonna did for the entire lifetime of her career. I love especially the scene where she stripteases from a cabaret costume with the fedora hat. Hot! And all this plot about the gangster guys and how she needs to protect her and her daughter makes it a timeless, revolutionary movie in my opinion. a+. For the relatively low budget at the time in 1996 this movie is a modern masterpiece in my opinion and since almost 20 years no one has even dared to replicate such subject matter and plot on the big screen.",Striptease
124,epic_of_mayhem,Hiaasen should slap somebody,5,4 October 2006,"for those of you who don't know (and I'm sure there's a lot of you) Strip Tease was actually a book written by Carl Hiaasen, and a damn good book at that. Brilliant characters, an intriguing storyline, hilarious incidents, sex, violence, the works...I gave the movie a 5 because Robert Patrick and Burt Reynolds were absolutely hysterical and on-point (I'm sure THEY actually READ the book), but aside from those two gems this movie was a disgrace.What happened to the plot?!? What happened to like half the story?!? What happened to my self respect?!? Why change the ending?!? The story was enthralling and thoroughly enjoyable when I read the book, the movie (breasts considered) not so much..There's a gratuitous 3 minute topless dancing scene, followed by 3 minutes of Demi and the little girl crying and being superdramatic. CHOOSE which audience you're marketing this movie towards! Women won't respect a nonsense T&A fest and men don't want to see a bunch of sappy overdramatics when the movie was advertised like a softcore porno flick.The fact that a BOOK about strippers was exponentially better than the movie.. that's saying something.Anonymous Disgrunted Hiaasen Fan",Striptease

126,seriksson,The worst film ever made,1,19 August 2005,"I have considered this long and hard, but can honestly conclude that I have never seen a worst film than this. Most films in ""worst films"" lists are low budget films that were rushed B movies that turned into D movies. But Striptease has no excuses. The story is taken from a good book and made into the worst script I have ever heard. Of course, the acting, direction and script are all bad, but with Striptease they are so consistently awful throughout the film that it really defies belief.And don't even mention Demi making her character such a mindnumbingly clichéd ""doing it for the kids"" mom! Starpower at its worst? Nothing can beat this.",Striptease
