0,Leofwine_draca,Poorly-scripted drug trafficking drama,4,15 May 2016,"THE COUNSELLOR is an odd film from director Ridley Scott. While his direction remains exemplary and is difficult to fault, the script from novelist Cormac McCarthy (THE ROAD) is very poor and difficult to fathom. I don't think it's a good idea for novelists to attempt to write such scripts, because novels are nothing like screenplays and such films sometimes come across feeling false and too wordy. That's the case here.Although the plotting in this film isn't too convoluted, it's the dialogue that really drags this down and makes everything feel twice as long as it really takes. Everyone in here is some kind of moral philosopher, given to sitting down and spouting long treaties to the other characters. None of what they say is very interesting, and much of it is rather dull. Hollywood seems to have a real problem in making films about drug trafficking; like SAVAGES, this one misses the mark.The problem lies with the characters; there are a lot of them, often played by popular actors, but none are good. Michael Fassbender's lead feels extraneous in the story and is one-dimensional throughout. Cameron Diaz is miscast and really struggling, and Penelope Cruz is there for the glamour alone. The only one who comes out of it with his head held high is Brad Pitt, who makes things feel as effortless as ever. The rest of the cast seem to show up to do a scene and then disappear again for good. This isn't what film-making is about.",The Counselor
1,SnoopyStyle,characters with no compelling interest,5,23 April 2014,"The Counselor (Michael Fassbender) is a defense lawyer with questionable friends like Reiner (Javier Bardem). Reiner is a brash club owner living a lavish lifestyle and introduces the Counselor to drug trafficker Westray (Brad Pitt). The Counselor proposes to girlfriend Laura (Penélope Cruz). Reiner's woman Malkina (Cameron Diaz) is wild and outrageous. Meanwhile the drug cartel is transporting drugs in an old liquid waste tank truck. The Counselor has a client Ruth (Rosie Perez) in prison. Her son is connected to the drugs and he bails him out of a speeding ticket. Then things go terribly wrong.I don't know what Cormac McCarthy wrote but what director Ridley Scott put on the screen is a mess. None of the four main characters are compelling. Fassbender projects no emotions. Bardem is way over the top still with a bit of Bond villain in him. Diaz is at least interesting, but Cruz is lost in this innocent sweet character. Brad Pitt comes in for a nice cameo. The story feels disjointed. There are bits of great ideas dispersed throughout the movie. However the bits don't add up to a compelling movie. All the A-list stars step on each other. It needs a grittier dirtier style to make this realistic and exciting. The action comes in a little too late. And Fassbender's coolness works against him here.",The Counselor
2,Horst_In_Translation,"Great ingredients, but the meal isn't perfect",6,15 December 2013,"Probably nobody can argue that a film directed by Ridley Scott, written by Cormac McCarthy and starring Bardem, Cruz, Diaz, Fassbender and Pitt has all the potential to end up as one of the year's finest pieces of moviemaking. The result of the above is, among other things, smart dialog delivered convincingly. However, they also say that too many cooks spoil the broth. I'm not entirely certain if that proverb applies to this film as well. The biggest issue with ""The Counselor"" for me was the action. It all felt a bit too over the top and extreme, especially in terms of violence and sexuality. To some extent, it was certainly justified, but somehow often it also felt included to shock or arouse just for the sake of it.Sometimes it felt like a poor man's ""No Country for Old Men"", McCarthy's masterpiece so far. Just like in that one, it's also the smaller characters who leave a bit of an impact here, like Bruno Ganz as a diamond salesman, whose part I certainly wouldn't have minded bigger. Same goes for Dean Norris, who'd have been nice to watch in more than one scene, especially with his recent rise in popularity from ""Breaking Bad's"" superbly hyped final season. Pitt doesn't have much screen time either, but shines a lot during his one major scene and creates an interesting character who could deserve an own movie as well. Which is unlikely to happen though given ""The Counselor"" scored big neither with critics nor with audiences. Another interesting aspect was the connection between Fassbender and Cruz. They only have one scene together, right at the beginning, and even if that scene could have been hardly more intense, I'm not sure it was sufficient to make the viewer interested enough in Fassbender's struggles with possibly losing her throughout the entire movie. However, near the end, when things unfold and we hear the phone conversation. We are listening a certain kind of wisdom from the other end of the line just like Fassbender's character does. That was easily the emotional highlight of the film. In contrast to that, what I didn't really like was Cameron Diaz' character as a super secret agent always in control of everything. I'm not entirely certain if it was her or the way Malkina was written, but it didn't feel particularly credible to me that she was pulling the straws and being the only one sort of who made it out alive at the end. Also the whole motorbike helmet / mourning mother parts weren't executed half as convincingly as they could have been.I believe this movie ends up clearly weaker than what it aspired to be. It's not entirely bad though. If you look beyond the storyline getting a bit messy and confusing sometimes and just take it for what it is, a violent thriller with occasionally dark humor (my favorite ""funny"" scene was when we see a boy's head being severed and then it cuts right to one character sort of removing the head, the cork, of a champagne bottle), and don't look for a deeper meaning, you can have a decent time watching it. It certainly has its moments, especially dialog-wise and also action-wise, like Bardem's or Pitt's final scenes or of course Diaz' spectacular ""car ride"".",The Counselor
3,Prismark10,Cheetahs and diamonds,3,19 September 2014,"Cormac McCarthy is a distinguished novelist but his screenplay for The Counsellor is a mis-fire and the direction of Ridley Scott is off and not helped by the yellow grading which makes the picture look unappealing and even cheap.The film opens rather erotically with Michael Fassbender as the Counsellor and Penelope Cruz as his fiancée. As the film goes on you have lengthy scenes of people talking about life, philosophy, diamonds, poetry, sex, death and even torture. Some of it may even rebound on our characters later as if the writer and director wish to impart a connection but its just obvious signposting such as the contraption that strangles people or references to snuff videos.Anyhow with all this talking, various characters popping up for seemingly no reason a plot emerges and then suddenly The Counsellor along with Javier Bardem and Brad Pitt are all in danger from the Mexican Cartel. You might say the novelist has yet to figure out that writing a screenplay had a different skill set. There is little by way of exposition. The Counsellor is suddenly out of his league but he was never in the league in the first place.The actors are doing their best speaking their lines but its characters in search of a plot.",The Counselor
4,nogodnomasters,A CAUTIONARY DIAMOND,7,16 July 2018,"Michael Fassbender stars in the title role as a lawyer, who as far as I could tell his name was Counselor. He becomes engaged to Lara (Penélope Cruz) who is as pretty as she is naive. Reiner (Javier Bardem) is a rich friend who claims ""Women are an expensive hobby."" His girlfriend Malkina (Cameron Diaz) is extremely high maintenance and out of everyone's league. Counselor has a chance to make some big money when he meets a smooth talking, mutual friend, middle man Westray (Brad Pitt) who arranges for Counselor to finance a drug deal. Seems the biggest problem is going to be how to hide the money. Then in the blink of an eye, things go so wrong as now Counselor and Westray try not to star in a Latino snuff film.The production spends most of the time building up characters with smart dialog. When the twist happens, this changes the film from a clever drama into an action crime drama that needed better action and to last longer. The film seemed to go down hill at the very moment it should have rocketed. It is a well acted film which I enjoyed mostly for the build up. It just didn't bring it home like it should, clearly a weak screen play adaptation.Worth a view as a rental.Parental Guide: F-bomb. Sex. No nudity (Cameron Diaz side breast)",The Counselor
5,kosmasp,Expectations,8,14 June 2014,"I'm not sure what most people were expecting, but it's obvious the movie did not meet whatever that was. If you have so many big names in one movie, those expectations can get very heavy obviously. Still this movie is really good, just not on what some thought it promised them. I haven't seen the trailer yet, but I know those trailers can be deceiving as well as promoting something.The movie has a very philosophical strain and can be watched a couple of times. There is also a sexual tone that some might find disturbing (especially the car window thing, you'll know when you watch it), but it's all about dominance. And it's about life choices and planting things that you will for better or worse reap ... not everyones cup of tea, but a very strong movie nevertheless.",The Counselor
6,jboothmillard,The Counsellor,4,13 January 2021,"I became interested in this film because of its director Sir Ridley Scott (Alien, Blade Runner, Thelma & Louise, Gladiator, Thelma Martian) and the all-star cast, I think I saw some clips, so I was for it. Basically, a suave and prominent lawyer, known only as the Counsellor (Michael Fassbender), makes a living representing drug dealers and criminals. He is desperately in need of cash to pay off increasing debts. The Counsellor's friend Reiner (Javier Bardem) and his greedy former call-girl girlfriend Malkina (Cameron Diaz) discuss a nightclub they hope to buy and talk about an upcoming one-off deal that is worth millions. The Counsellor decides to enter the obscure world of drug trafficking, wanting to give his girlfriend Laura (Penélope Cruz), a lavish lifestyle. Laura has accepted the Counsellor's proposal of marriage, but she is unaware of his situation. Shady but established middleman Westray (Brad Pitt), a business associate of Reiner's, warns the Counsellor about becoming involved, saying that Mexican cartels packaging loads of cocaine are merciless. When the drug deal starts to go wrong, the Counsellor finds himself unprepared to deal with the fallout, and he has to protest his bride-to-be from the wrath of the cartel. Westray explains that the cartel's ruthlessness extends to creating ""snuff films"" where murder victims are filmed having necrophilia performed on them on camera. Reiner is accidentally killed by cartel members while they are attempting to capture him, and then they kidnap Laura. The Counsellor goes to Mexico, hoping to find and rescue Laura. But in his hotel room there, a package containing a DVD is slipped under the door, and he breaks down, aware that it is likely to be from the cartel and contains a snuff film of Laura. In an unnamed location, Laura's headless body is thrown into a landfill site. Malkina tried and failed to steal the drugs herself, without success. But she tracks Westray to London, where she hires a Blonde woman (Game of Thrones' Natalie Dormer) to seduce him in order to steal his bank codes. She then has accomplices steal Westray's laptop and he is killed. It ends withy Malkina meeting her Banker (Goran Visnjic) at a restaurant, coolly explaining how she wants her profits and accounts to be handled. Also starring Breaking Bad's Dean Norris as Buyer, Rosie Perez as Ruth, Bruno Ganz as Diamond Dealer, Toby Kebbell as Tony, Emma Rigby as Tony's Girlfriend, Edgar Ramírez Edgar Ramírez as Priest, Donna Air as Chauffeur, and John Leguizamo as Coverall Man Randy. Fassbender is reasonable as the unnamed title character, Bardem is interesting with his afro-like hairstyle being shady, I felt like Pitt could have done more, and Diaz stands out as the manipulative, predatory, cheetah-owning, tattooed, former prostitute crook's girlfriend. It is let by a slightly silly script, with only memorable characters and performances making an impact, you are almost left to fill in the blanks. It was hard for me to follow most of the time, apart from the obvious bits, including violent encounters and dodgy dealings, but to be honest, I got a little bored, but for those few moments that did get my attention, it is an alright crime thriller. Okay!",The Counselor
7,rmax304823,This Is Drugs On Your Brain.,7,16 February 2015,"I was able to watch only about an hour of this, so these remarks are qualified.My TV Guide gave this production only two stars. I don't know why. The story is simple enough at the start. The eponymous counselor is Michael Fassbinder, who looks the part of a whitebread lawyer. He's engaged and truly in love with Penelope Cruz, a state for which he can't be faulted.A Mexican acquaintance, Javier Bardem, almost unrecognizable with a Halloween hair do, talks Fassbinder into a deal with drugs, and refers him to Brad Pitt as a middleman who arranges the smuggling from Mexico to Estados Unitos inside some kind of ugly tanker truck.Bardem's girl friend is Cameron Diaz, who is unpredictable and odd. And that minimizes her unusual properties. Rosie Perez is one of Fassbinder's clients, now in the slams, who asks him to do her a favor and get her son out of jail. He was arrested for the minor charge of speeding on his motorcycle. Fassbinder does as she asks, not knowing that the son is speeding around and carrying secret tech equipment at the behest of the drug cartel.Then it begins to get complicated, and then I was called away, by Morpheus.It's from a novel by Cormac McCarthy and directed by Ridley Scott. And the writing and direction are well above average. The dialog has some real sparkle in it, just elliptical enough to be convincing as drug-running argot.Fassbinder, as I say, looks straight and earnest. It's too bad that the deal apparently doesn't work out well for him. And Brad Pitt is convincing as the savvy intermediary who warns Fassbinder, as Mickey O'Rourke warned another lawyer in ""Body Heat,"" ""Don't do it, counselor."" Penelope Cruz is lovey-dovey and Cameron Diaz is properly sinister. There is a hilarious scene in which Bardem describes an incident in his car with Diaz. She's going to ""**** my car."" So Diaz gets out, removes her underpants, hops on the hood, and gets off by rubbing up and down on the windshield before Bardem's goggling eyes.Barden tries to capture the picture by comparing it to a catfish or something, one of those fish that glues itself to the glass in an aquarium and sucks its way up and down. ""She got in the car and asked what I thought, and I said it was too gynecological to be sexy."" But why, then, does Bardem still love her. He doesn't know. Maybe he's ""in love with easeful death."" (That quote is from Keat's ""Ode to a Nightingale."") But I understand it ends tragically and, as in Hamlet, everyone winds up mincemeat. Judging from what I saw, if it's a tragedy, it's well above the usual garbage that graces our screens these days. ""Saw IV"" is a tragedy too.",The Counselor
8,blanche-2,breaking real bad,4,25 September 2014,"A true A cast - Michael Fassbender, Javier Bardem, Penelope Cruz, and Cameron Diaz, Bruno Ganz and Brad Pitt(!) star in ""The Counselor"" a 2013 Ridley Scott film. I mean, you just can't get any better than that.It just goes to show you that you can have have the world's biggest budget, the biggest stars, the biggest director, a property based on a top-notch book and produce a total disaster.Michael Fassbender plays The Counselor, who is in love with the beautiful Laura (Cruz), so much so that he asks her to marry him. He seems like a decent guy, but when it comes to a point that he needs money, he stupidly gets involved in drug trafficking. He's warned against it by a friend (Bardem) who is involved, and he's warned off by another player (Pitt), but he's in.I'll start with this, and I know it's a ridiculous question -- is there anyone anywhere in the world that doesn't know what drug traffickers do to people whom they suspect of cheating them, or screwing up? Can it be possible that this man lives in a world where there was no ""Breaking Bad""? First of all, in my life I've never heard dialogue like this. AWFUL. I don't even know how anyone spoke it without laughing. At the end of the film, two characters have a dialogue -- well, one does all the talking: ""The extinction of all reality is a concept no resignation can encompass. And then, all the grand designs and all the grand plans will be finally exposed and revealed for what they are."" And this guy's native language wasn't even English. What claptrap.And the plot. Sketchy, as if most of the story was left out. If only it had been.So what are we left with? Eroticism, which is fine but just kind of thrown in there; visual horror, which was disgusting and gross; and no attachment to the characters. Plenty of horror was to be found in ""Breaking Bad,"" but it was a compelling story with fascinating characters.The actual story is quite interesting but badly handled. I won't bother talking about the acting since these poor people had enough problems.I look around this site and I see that some people thought this was a really good film. I am going to bet that a good 95% of them, if not more, are men. And why not -- gorgeous Penelope Cruz, gorgeous Cameron Diaz, lots of leg, some sex. And for this they assembled a big, important cast and spent $25 million. And flopped. Given what's been going on in the world lately, not the film to see. I can watch this type of thing on underground news shows.",The Counselor
9,Quinoa1984,"A one-time deal, right?",6,7 November 2014,"And now we turn to the Wheel of Morality! Wheel of Morality, turn turn turn, tell us the lesson that we should learn: morale number 666: and the moral of the story is... never keep dating a woman who (bleeps) your windshield spread eagle! Oh, and its both, paradoxically, one of Scott's most wonderfully directed films - in looking at how actors emote in a scene or move around or the camera goes about its business it's fine - and one of the most haphazardly written. McCarthy's script (at least the theatrical cut, I haven't got around to the extended one) feels like a first draft of a script that needed one to ten more rewrites, which I have to wonder Scott bothered to commission. Or maybe I'm wrong and they went about like Hollywood Jean Luc Godards (and I get that contradiction) making overloaded philosophical musings make sense in a story that is rather simple.And its a shame since the dialog is fine, usually, perhaps some of the exchanges are natural and give the actors (especially Bardem but maybe Fassbender too, Diaz is both great and terrible) something to play with. What it comes down to are large portions of the story that feel either cut out or too obtuse (is it deliberate?) to really matter much. Only in the couple of interesting (and graphic) plants and payoffs does McCarthy shine as a writer, NOT stopping a scene to have a character spout babble.In other words, if you're looking for Cameron Diaz squirting all over glass, this is the movie for you! But its another movie, and this is a weird comparison, like Man of Steel or the Lone Ranger from this year where you can see talented storytellers, occasionally firing on all cylinders, and... dramatically speaking, they get their heads up their asses.",The Counselor
10,edwagreen,This Counselor Needs Advice *,2,28 June 2014,"It takes the film over one hour before the extremely weak plot begins to unravel.It never fully explains how attorney Michael Fassbender got involved in this drug mess. The whole thing goes terribly awry with the decapitation of one of the participants, and as a result Fassbender and his crew are blamed and some awful things begin to happen.Javier Bardem is fortunate in that his character is killed off after about an hour. Ditto for Brad Pitt who falls near the end of this mess. The cutting of his carotid arteries is most disgusting on the screen.Penelope Cruz has the misfortune to be Fassbender's girlfriend and she too pays with her life. Fassbender has a ridiculous conversation with her killer and we hear talking about the philosophy of life.The one shining star in this colossal bomb is Cameron Diaz, who shows a maturity she has rarely shown in films.",The Counselor
11,sunwarrior13,Confusing Dialogues And Weird Scenes Like Cameron Diaz Screwing The Car Almost Turned It Into A Mess,8,26 October 2014,"The Counselor is a independent thriller about a lawyer known only as ""Counselor"" gets involved over drug trafficking once around Ciudad Juarez in Mexico and the Texas border that gets him into a lot of trouble.It stars Michael Fassbender in the lead role together with a talented supporting cast that includes Penélope Cruz, Cameron Diaz, Javier Bardem and Brad Pitt.This is a screenplay written by Cormac McCarthy and Ridley Scott directed the film that deals with the themes of greed,avarice,survival and death. The film could have been a lot better.Too bad that it could provide a lot of confusion to the viewer due to its somewhat enigmatic dialogues that characters have to say which only philosophy and poetry majors could only comprehend.Added to that,it also tries to achieve a lot of Shakespearean depth that it makes a mess of what could have become a great film considering of the talent involved in it.Weird scenes are also added such as Cameron Diaz's screwing a car that provides nothing to the movie except a chance for parody among comedians and movie- goers who want to remember something from it.She could have done something better to prove that she is the femme fatale rather than that.Finally,the themes of greed and materialism could have been presented better if the screenplay provided more background to the characters involved.Overall,one should probably watch it more than once to have a better appreciation of the movie and not rate it as a poor one.Too bad it just turned out to be somewhat a forgettable movie upon the first viewing.",The Counselor
12,LeonLouisRicci,"Wordy, Witty, or Something",7,12 March 2014,"Directed by Ridley Scott with a Screenplay by Cormac McCarthy, to get the Name Dropping out of the way, or to Add some More...Michael Fassbender, Cameron Diaz, Javier Bardem, and Brad Pitt, or so to say that Expectations were High for this One would be an Understatement.Understatement is not in Short Supply here. There is a lot of Stating. Long, Sometimes Incomprehensible, Wordy Nonsense about Sex, Drugs, and the Rock n' Rolling of the Universe.

All the All Stars Manage to Bring their Personal sort of Chutzpah to the Movie with Cameron Diaz and Javier Bardem the Most Compelling. Michael Fassbender's Frozen Face is Hardly Worth Much as He comes Across so Petrified. It Appears, much of the Time that He got High on His Own Supply, although We are Assured He doesn't do Drugs. How Noble this Weeping Hero.The Dialog is the Thing here and if this Didacticism Stimulates than so be it, but Much of it is so Thick and Deep it is Wise to take a deep breath before Swimming in this Cesspool of Monologues that can be Insightful but most of the Time are Confusing and Rambling and Perhaps on Page where One can Study the Prose is More Affecting.Overall it is one for the Eggheads and Thinkers and those Expecting a Thriller-Thriller may be Disappointed.

What a huge waste of talent this is. The opening love scene between Michael Fassbender and Penelope Cruz is so awkwardly unerotic I found myself laughing out loud at it. Scene after scene that went on too long and made no sense. The plot was disjointed and sloppy and seemed like a vanity play for the actors involved, particularly Cameron Diaz and Javier Bardem.

14,zardoz-13,Evil At Its Most Audacious!!!,10,28 October 2013,"Watching the star-studded Ridley Scott drug smuggling caper ""The Counselor"" is like paying to participate in a ""Scared Straight"" program. ""Scared Straight"" is that fear-inducing program where juveniles are given a taste of what to expect if they pursue the path of evil. Hopefully, the convicts who intimidate the juveniles in ""Scared Straight"" frighten them out of a notorious life of criminal endeavor. In ""The Counselor,"" a well-to-do Texas attorney gets himself caught up in a narcotics smuggling scheme and learns first-hand the meaning of Murphy's Law. Everything that can go wrong for our ill-fated protagonist does go wrong, and the hardened hellions who surround him warn him at every turn to back out before it is too late. Michael Fassbender top-lines a stellar cast of familiar faces that include Penélope Cruz, Cameron Diaz, Oscar-winner Javier Bardem, Brad Pitt, Rosie Perez, Rubén Blades, and Goran Visnjic. In most Hollywood crime melodramas, the good guys win in the end, but ""The Counselor"" has no winners except its toxic felons. If you abhor movies were evil triumphs over virtue, ""The Counselor"" is definitely not for you. You aren't tempted to sympathize for anybody. ""Alien"" director Ridley Scott and Pulitzer Prize winner author Cormac McCarthy have combined their considerable talents to craft a movie that is incredibly chilling. For the record, Cormac McCarthy is the same fellow who wrote the novel that the Coen brothers turned into the movie ""No Country for Old Men. Brad Pitt's death scene in ""The Counselor"" alone is worth the price of admission if you can keep your hands away from your eyes.The hero in ""The Counselor"" (Michael Fassbender of ""The Centurion"") is known only as 'the Counselor.' Nobody ever addresses him by either his first or last name. This El Paso attorney has wind in his sails. Successful and savvy, he cruises around in a convertible Bentley and appears to want for nothing. Happily, he has landed the lady of his dreams, Laura (Penélope Cruz of ""All the Pretty Horses""), and he dotes so dearly on her that he flies to Amsterdam personally to choose the diamond for her wedding ring. Little does Laura know is that her handsome fiancé has gone into business with a couple of low-class dastards living high off the hog. A shady night club owner named Reiner (Javier Bardem of ""No Country for Old Men"") who has snorted one line too many and a smooth-talking cowboy, Westray (Brad Pitt of ""Thelma & Louise""), both warn 'the Counselor' repeatedly that he should turn tail and light out. Indeed, ""The Counselor"" amounts to a Biblical caveat to flee evil. Our naive hero has bought himself a piece of a $20-million cocaine caper with the shipment of smack destined to be delivered to Chicago. Meanwhile, beneath the border in old Mexico, the cartel seals up their product in large, air-tight barrels and conceals them in squat, heavy, septic truck that looks like it could go bumper-to- bumper with an armored car in a demolition derby and win. The in-joke is that one of those barrels contains the pickled body of a Colombian who has endlessly been shipped back-and-forth like a joker in a deck of cards for whoever finds him. When he is found, he is resealed and shipped off with a qualm. The bad guys get the vehicle across the border safely without a hassle, but another bunch of thieves later hijack the truck. Not only do they steal the truck, but they also decapitate one of their motorcycle adversaries called ""The Green Hornet"" with a wire strung across the highway! Death is as horrifically gruesome here as it was in any ""Saw"" sagas. These guys and their cronies don't any better. They are waylaid by another pair of cartel gunsels masquerading as Texas Rangers and die in a fierce gunfight. An innocent motorist driving up on the scene of the shoot-out by accident desperately struggles to elude lead, but he doesn't stand a chance of making a getaway. The surviving cartel gunman calmly reloads his machine-pistol and riddles the poor slob's truck. Not even the innocent bystanders have a chance in ""The Counselor!""""The Counselor"" boasts an array of vicious but memorable villains. Cameron Diaz of the ""Charlie's Angels"" epics stands out more prominently than either Javier Bardem or Brad Pitt. The character that she plays crossed the moral line between good and evil so far back that even if she looked back, she would never see that line. We are told the only thing that she remembers about her parents was the sight of seeing them thrown from a helicopter at age three. Vulgar wench that she is, her idea of sport involves turning her pair of pet cheetahs loose on jack rabbits in the desert at dawn. Malkina, as she is called, has cheetah spots tattooed all over her back, loves to masturbate on her boyfriend's car windshield, and goes to confession as a joke to regale the priest with her tawdry tales. As it turns out, she is the evil mastermind behind the thief of the smack. Who says women cannot be bad girls? When scenarist Cormac McCarthy isn't creating devilishly, overwrought villains, he conjures up some of the most poetic dialogue that you will ever hear. Meanwhile, Scott and ""Crimson Tide"" lenser Dariusz Wolski have created a movie that on the basis of its elegant cinematography will take your breath away when the hair on your back isn't standing up. Altogether, ""The Counselor"" qualifies as a superb but corrosive crime thriller with harrowing death scenes that you won't forget after the rest of the action has faded from your memory. There are no happy endings here for anybody. Spectators who love to challenge themselves to see how much offensive material they can swallow before losing their cookies will probably be the only ones that will truly appreciate Scott's masterpiece of amoral horror.",The Counselor
15,george.schmidt,Disappointing neo-noir from Ridley Scott and Cormac McCarthy,1,14 November 2013,"THE COUNSELOR (2013) * Michael Fassbender, Penelope Cruz, Cameron Diaz, Javier Bardem, Brad Pitt, Bruno Ganz, Rosie Perez, Ruben Blades, Goran Visnjic, Dean Norris, (uncredited: John Leguizamo) Disappointing neo-noir from Ridley Scott and Cormac McCarthy (his first - and should be his last - original screenplay) which makes not-a-lick-of-sense about titular Fassbender (surprisingly wooden) who finds himself in over his head in a drug deal gone awry involving mysterious cowboy middleman PItt (far-too-sedate here), an obnoxious nightclub owner (Bardem relying on wild-hair and rock star accouterments instead of 'acting), and a drug cartel out for bloody vengeance. The cardinal sin of this potboiler is the first leaden hour cannot compensate for its too-quick-to-kill final one and wasting Cruz completely.

16,neil-476,Broadly unsatisfactory,7,22 November 2013,"A lawyer, out of money but keen to maintain his upmarket lifestyle and treat his new wife to expensive stuff, gets involved in a drugs deal which goes horribly wrong.My experience of Cormac McCarthy - The Counsellor is his first movie script - comprises the films of No Country For Old Men (a hard boiled character piece and thriller which cheats its audience out of an ending) and The Road (unrelenting grimness and pessimism). Ridley Scott has, in my view, spent his career matching exemplary visuals with storytelling which varies from muddled to poor. So I was not surprised to discover that The Counsellor is a hard boiled character piece and thriller of unrelenting grimness and pessimism with exemplary visuals and muddled storytelling which nearly cheats its audience out of a proper ending (what actually happens to The Counsellor?) The performances are all good, and I particularly liked Cameron Diaz' femme fatale (who delivers a sequence of eye-watering rudeness) even though I could never quite work out where she fitted into the whole thing.Because one of the major flaws in this piece is its vagueness. You don't know quite how the drugs deal works, where the Counsellor fits into it, who is double crossing who and why, who gets what out of it etc. You are shown some quite specific material of the drug transportation in progress, and some of the things which happen during their journey, but you are never given a clue as to where they fit in. You only see the horrible consequences (levied by whom? And why?).There are things like Brad Pitt relating a couple of gruesome anecdotes, and you just know they are only there because that is going to happen to someone later on - yes, here it comes! In many ways, this is pretty amateurish stuff, put together by people who should know better.",The Counselor
17,ferguson-6,Convoluted does not equal Complex,3,27 October 2013,"Greetings again from the darkness. The best dramatic writers thrive on creating a story filled with intricacies, multi-faceted characters, mis-direction, and a complex interweaving of sub-plots. Cormac McCarthy has proved he is one of the best such writers through his highly successful novels ... some of which have made the transition to the screen: All the Pretty Horses, The Road, and of course, No Country for Old Men. This, however, is his first attempt at an original screenplay. Describing it as a disappointment is a severe understatement. The cool parts of this movie: Bruno Ganz as a diamond dealer in Amsterdam and the two live cheetahs.The parts of the film that could have been interesting: the wardrobes of all main characters, Javier Bardem's Brian Grazer-inspired hairdo, the line-up of luxury vehicles (Bentley, Ferrari, etc), and the ""bolito"".The parts of this movie that were never going to work: the opening scene with Michael Fassbender and Penelope Cruz frolicking under the sheets, dialogue that is too poetic for the characters, Brad Pitt as his grown up scammer from Thelma and Louise, Fassbender's Texas accent, and Cameron Diaz.The part of this movie that is an outright disgrace: Cameron Diaz doing the splits while having intimate relations with the windshield of Bardem's Ferrari ... maybe this idea came from Joe Eszterhas after being rejected as too outlandish for Showgirls.Chances are viewers will fall into two camps: thinking this is a wild and crazy ride inside the Mexican drug cartel, OR believing this is one of 2013's sloppiest, messiest, most pointless and confusing wastes of time in a movie theater. I am solidly in group two and can't even recommend you see this to determine where you fall.The cast is filled with A-listers: Javier Bardem, Brad Pitt, Michael Fassbender, Penelope Cruz, and Cameron Diaz. The writer is a renowned novelist. The director is three time Oscar nominee Ridley Scott. How could it miss? Even the best actors can be miscast. Even the best writers have work best left unpublished. Even the best directors lose control of a project.I guess the best running joke throughout the movie is that Fassbender's titular character is constantly receiving counseling, rather than offering it. At its core, the story is just another drug deal gone bad (do any movie drug deals ever go ""right""?). With it's unusual visuals, unrealistic conversations, and convoluted sub-plots, this one would have played better as a slideshow. Instead, I am left with this: I'll never look at a smudge on my windshield the same again.",The Counselor
18,anaconda-40658,Diaz Needs Counselling.,8,1 December 2015,"The Counselor (2013): Dir: Ridley Scott / Cast: Michael Fassbender, Penelope Cruz, Javier Bardem, Cameron Diaz, Brad Pitt: Skillful yet unpleasant film that ultimately represents the wages of sin. Michael Fassbender plays the counselor in question. He is a lawyer whose greed leads to a drug trafficking scheme that has severe consequences. Detailed with numerous plot turns and double crosses, some viewers will resent the ending, which provides dialogue of reason for the behavior involved but ultimately allows for sin to wage on. Director Ridley Scott used similar themes in Thelma and Louise where characters excel to the edge of consequence until there is no other move but death. Fassbender plays a lawyer undone by his ignorance with regards to his abilities. He takes an emotional turn when options run out and everything he cared for is torn away leaving him crumpled in a Mexican hotel room weeping. Penelope Cruz plays his naive fiancé unaware of his business nature until it is too late. Javier Barden with hair on ends and loud clothes plays Reiner, a drug dealing client of Fassbender's. He is an entrepreneur as a cover for his real dealings. Cameron Diaz plays Reiner's sexually charged girlfriend Malkina, a malicious poisonous vixen whose nature is much like the two cheetahs she owns. Hunting down and destroying until she scavages what she wants. Brad Pitt is featured in a bit part and ends up trying to skip out of town after warning Fassbender but something gruesome looms ahead. This is a violently graphic and soulless presentation that finds no release from its snare. Score: 8 / 10",The Counselor
19,phd_travel,Stop it Cormac! Ridley and Cameron how could you?,1,3 December 2013,I always thought Cormac McCarthy's stories a bit overrated. Gross gruesome and ugly. But this movie really takes the cake. It's bad beyond belief. What is amazing is how they managed to get top notch actors and director to do this movie. Unlike No Country this tale tries to contrast some glamorous with the ugly but the whole story is so pointless is just isn't worth the effort.The sexual scenes are so bad they aren't even funny from the opening scene with Penelope and it's banal dialog to Cameron and the car. She is above such a degrading scene. She is A list. Brad Pitt all uglied up is above this too. As for Michael Fassbender I know actors more often than not have to take roles they can get but this one wasn't worth it. At least he didn't have to hump a car. The violent deaths and decapitation by that stupid device are just violence for the sake of violence and serve no purpose.The screenplay is so badly written that the plot isn't clear in a totally unnecessary way. There are so many stupid things like why didn't Penelope's character get out of town straight away? What about Javier's character he knew he was in trouble too. The speeches by the characters are okay but hardly compensate for the story. The only good point is the ending is realistic didn't have any cute rescues but it was just so depressing.Don't waste your time.,The Counselor
20,gradyharp,'I'm pretty skeptical about the goodness of the good.',5,12 February 2014,"For those Cormac McCarthy fans this film will probably be disappointing. Cormac's novels bask in run-on sentences, philosophical tangents and just smart ideas while they accompany the well-paced story. This, however, is a straight screenplay, not an adaptation of one of his books, and therein lies the problem. If sitting still through endless conversations about grief, the meaning of life, the impact of loss on the human soul etc entertain you, then you'll love this very slow film. If that kind of thematic dialogue calls attention to itself purely for the sake of 'profound thinking', then perhaps you will be disappointed with a film packed with excellent actors but lacking a credible story. Examples of seated dialogue: 'I suspect that we are ill-formed for the path we have chosen. Ill-formed and ill-prepared. We would like to draw a veil over all the blood and terror that have brought us to this place. It is our faintness of heart that would close our eyes to all of that, but in so doing it makes of it our destiny... But nothing is crueler than a coward, and the slaughter to come is probably beyond our imagining.' And more: 'When it comes to grief, the normal rules of wealth do not apply. Because grief transcends value. A man would give entire nations to lift grief off his heart and yet, you cannot buy anything with grief, because grief is worthless.' When isolated and read (as in McCarthy's fine books) it works well, but place these words as a substitute for dialogue and it pretty much crashes and burns.The region is the El Paso/Suarez border. A rich and successful lawyer, the Counselor (Michael Fassbender), is about to get married to his fiancée Laura (Penélope Cruz) but soon becomes entangled in a complex drug plot with a middle-man known as Westray (Brad Pitt). The plan ends up taking a horrible twist and he must protect himself and his soon to be bride as the truth of the drug business is uncovered and targets are eliminated. The other characters who walk on and off the set include a diamond dealer (Bruno Ganz), a wealthy questionably legal dealer Reiner (Javier Bardem) and his all important mistress Malkina (Cameron Diaz), the jailed mother (Rosie Perez) of a druggie biker (Richard Cabral) – but they all have so little to do with what's going on (whatever that is) that they remain interesting cameos.

22,KineticSeoul,Well it's watchable and it does have it's moments,6,24 May 2014,"This is a movie I saw the reviews by critics that ripped this movie apart before I actually watched it. I am not sure if it's because I had very low expectations for this movie or something along that line, but I was actually somewhat entertained with this flick. I am not quite sure if it's a guilty pleasure flick or not, but it does have entertaining and even kinda intriguing aspects. It seems almost like a missed opportunity for something that could have been great. It has a good cast that fits the roles they are given, awesome soundtrack and really good cinematography. What it falls short is the consistency and the development when it comes to the plot and characters. Some reviewers called the plot of this movie something difficult to follow, but it really isn't. Although the dialogue doesn't seem all that relevant when it comes to the core of the plot. The problem with this movie is how shallow it is, I know maybe it's to show the superficial, selfish and nihilistic side of humanity. But that is what everything comes down to, characters just constantly talking in a pedantic, hubris and snobbish manner amongst each other and especially with the counselor. Just about every characters in this movie is bleak, selfish and lacks a conscience except The Counselor (Michael Fassbender). While trying hard to act cool and suave at the same time. It just kinda seemed like Ridley Scott was trying to pull his own Quentin Tarantino, except not as self-indulgent. As a matter of fact the plot just seemed like something that is secondary and they just thought up a bunch of bleak dialogue and combined it into a plot. Which makes the message of this movie ambiguous. Maybe it's that the smallest mistake, even good intentioned or not can have severe consequences or change which would be a cool message. Or it's just that the people that actually has a code, morality and a conscience is the weak ones that gets torn apart by animals. Or just to show the vain, bleak and dark side of today's humanity and how they do things, maybe all three. Although this film can be intriguing from time to time, even if it mostly revolve around their perspective on women, greed and religion. With the exception of Westray the vain urban cowboy (Brad Pitt) who is the middle man and seems to make the most sense in the movie. When it comes to the ensemble cast is how Cameron Diaz is the one that pulls off the best performance in this movie as the epitome of a psychotic, capitalistic, conniving ""female dog"". Despite this film not really having a powerful script that makes the scenarios to be interwoven and crafted well which makes this movie seem pretentious at times. It seemed like the plot was building the characters up to be something, but leaves it not so satisfying when it came to the end. Which made this whole film lack weight and meat to it. It does have it's thrills and entertainment value though. As a matter of fact certain scenes in this movie just seemed to stick. I was also one of the viewers that found it funny how the smart-ass lawyer that has moral dilemmas The Counselor is the one that gets counseled throughout this movie. The thing is the structure of this film is well planned out and I could see that they were trying to go in a poetic, emotional and gut-churning direction. Unfortunately it just lacked intelligence and just didn't have much relevant substance to it. I give this a 6.9/10, I think maybe the highly negative reviews are there because of how much hype that went into this movie.6.9/10",The Counselor
23,Hellmant,Left me feeling down and uncomfortable for quite a long time afterwards.,8,28 October 2013,"'THE COUNSELOR': Four Stars (Out of Five) Acclaimed author Cormac McCarthy (of such popular books turned movies as 'NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN', 'THE ROAD', and 'ALL THE PRETTY HORSES') wrote his first original film screenplay for this Ridley Scott directed crime thriller. It features an all-star cast including Michael Fassbender, Penelope Cruz, Cameron Diaz, Javier Bardem, Brad Pitt, Rosie Perez and Ruben Blades. The film is extremely dark and gratuitously violent, like all the film adaptations based on McCarthy's work. It's also extremely dialogue heavy, like all other McCarthy films as well. It's received mostly negative reviews due to these things but I think it will long be talked about and remembered fondly (by some genre fans).Fassbender (who also starred in Scott's last film 'PROMETHEUS') plays a lawyer known strictly as 'Counselor'. He's engaged to the beautiful but naive Laura (Cruz, who also co-starred in 'ALL THE PRETTY HORSES') but despite this, and his financial success already, longs for more (out of greed and the fact that his greed has gotten him into a little financial trouble). So he decides to get involved in the dangerous business of drug trafficking with his friend and client Reiner (Bardem, who won a supporting actor Academy Award for his portrayal of the vicious killer in 'NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN'). Through Reiner Counselor meets Malkina (Diaz), a self centered sociopath who's also Reiner's girlfriend, and Westray (Pitt), who partners with Counselor on his first drug deal. Things go horribly wrong and everyone is put in grave danger because of it.I like Ridley Scott as a director immensely (the film is also dedicated to his late brother, filmmaker Tony Scott) but his films are sometimes mixed bags in quality and entertainment value. I'd say this movie is definitely a mixed bag. It's suspenseful and involving (to a certain point) but none of the characters are likable (except for Cruz) or developed enough. The performances are all good (especially Bardem and Pitt) and the visuals and atmosphere are striking but the film is also overly wordy and slow paced at times as well. It's also extremely dark and disturbing and excessively violent. It's definitely unpleasant and left me feeling down and uncomfortable for quite a long time afterwards (which I do give it credit for but it's not a film I'd be eager to see again anytime soon). It's definitely got it's strengths and reasons to see it but it's also a very flawed film as well.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AQkUJbRVsoM",The Counselor
24,wellthatswhatithinkanyway,A dire mess that completely misfires on every level,2,25 August 2014,"STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday MorningA lawyer known as The Counselor (Michael Fassbender) is in need of some money to buy an engagement ring for his girlfriend Laura (Penelope Cruz.) So he talks with his close friend Reiner (Javier Bardem) and is put in touch with Westray (Brad Pitt), a middleman who is instrumental in organising a cocaine deal. Meanwhile, The Counselor visits a woman in jail whose son has been arrested after speeding on a highway and being found with a lot of money in his crash helmet, along with a device used to steal some cocaine from a truck which belonged to a Mexican drug cartel. This will be instrumental in sending the lead protagonist down a dark and deadly path to self destruction.I have tried to describe the basic premise of Ridley Scott's latest, lavish film in as accurate a detail as I can, and I think I got it right, but not without a lot of mental wrangling and incomprehension. Scott, despite his ups and downs in terms of delivering solid work, has never been a director who has tried to include any subliminal meaning or subtext in his films, but that's the best guess for what's going on here, in this staggering misfire of a film, a colourful, all star offering that just leaves you overwhelmed and not in a good way.Somehow, even in the most abstract situations, Scott usually nails the dialogue perfectly and captures it in the most real and natural way possible. But no one speaks like a real person in this film, and all the prose seems completely laborious and overly heavy, drowning the viewer in a sea of incomprehension. But if the dialogue doesn't wear you down, the incomprehensible plot almost certainly well, where you're never really sure how one thing connects to the other or why the main characters are behaving the way they do given their position and situations. You get the feeling it's aiming for something deep and meaningful, but it never rubs off on anything, least of all the viewer.Scott has managed a real 'what the hell happened?' piece here, that revels in human tragedy and shocking violence, but gives you nothing to justify it in terms of the pay off. *",The Counselor
25,paul2001sw-1,Not as clever as it thinks it is,6,2 June 2017,"Ridely Scott's film 'The Counsellor' tells the story of a formerly straight lawyer who decides to carry out a drug deal, which (predictably) goes wrong. But this is not a conventional action film, except for brief excerpts: in the main, it consists of its very cool characters having highly stylised conversations (typified by the fact that the hero is only ever referred to eponymously as ""Counsellor"") about action that is mostly occurring off screen. Or, as Mark Kermode put it, reviewing for the Guardian, ""an A-list cast speaks B-movie dialogue with C-grade effects"", playing ""the kind of philosophising drug-dealers that even Tarantino would stay clear of"".

""The Counselor"" of the title is Michael Fassbender, a lawyer moving in high circles that includes drugs baron Javier Bardem and his lady Cameron Diaz as well as a shady 'cowboy' played by Brad Pitt and his involvement with such characters leads him into situations he might otherwise not want to find himself in.It's typical McCarthy, even if it's not front rank McCarthy, and maybe the tortuous plot proved too much for both critics and audiences but it's a movie that uses its showy cast , (that also inclues Penelope Cruz, Bruno Ganz, Rosie Perez, Edgar Ramirez and Rueben Blades), to excellent effect and thanks to Dariusz Wolski's cinematography it looks terrific. Best of all, it's a movie that takes familiar material and shakes it about in unconventional ways.

27,bowmanblue,Might of the Monologues,5,27 May 2014,"'The Counsellor' is an all-star cast, comprising of Michael Fassbender, Brad Pitt, Cameron Diaz and Penelope Cruz (excluding the numerous cameos by other well-known actors). Not only is it completely 'A-list,' but it's also directed by Sir Ridley Scott. With a cinematic pedigree like that, how could it fail? Well, it does its best.It's far to say that most people who have watched it have hated it. And it's not hard to see why. For a start, if you've seen the trailer, you may feel a little mislead. The trailer markets it (or at least a fair proportion of it) on 'action.' However, if you've watched the trailer, you've basically seen every car chase, punch and gunshot the movie contains. Basically, it's over two hours of people talking to each other.Michael Fassbender plays the titular character, known only as 'Counsellor.' We never learn his name. Why? No idea. He's *surprisingly* a counsellor, but has decided to do a drug deal. Why? No idea. So he travels around the world talking to one dodgy character after the next. And when I say talk, I really mean TALK. He doesn't just chat, he does a form of monologue which, in real life, is completely alien to how normal people interact with each other. Then, when he's finally shut up, the person he's come to see responds with an equally cryptic speech. And so it goes on, occasionally interspersed with *seemingly* random characters doing their own plot line.It's a tough film to watch all right. You really have to be in the mood for something totally 'talkie.' Yes, the actors are as good as their reputations suggest, but the dialogue they're forced to speak does come across as a little forced, even from them. The film is pretty watchable as the multiple monologues to lend a certain depth to our understanding of the characters, but, after a while, it does wear a little thin. The film is over two hours in length and the last half an hour is an even harder watch than what's gone before.Just don't expect wall-to-wall excitement and make sure you're in the mood for a slow two hours if you possibly hope to get the maximum out of this (although, fans of Cameron Diaz may get a little bonus when they see what she does with yellow sports cars!).http://thewrongtreemoviereviews.blogspot.co.uk/",The Counselor
28,dromasca,is this really a Ridley Scott movie?,5,11 July 2020,"A commission of inquiry should be set up to determine how it is possible that a film that gathers such a collection of talents as 'The Counselor' can disappoint to such an extent. The director is Ridley Scott the author of 'Alien', 'Blade Runner', 'Thelma & Louise' and 'Gladiator', the screenwriter is the successful novelist Cormac McCarthy at his first original script but the author of the novel that inspired the wonderful 'No Country for Old Men' , and the cast includes Javier Bardem, Penélope Cruz, Cameron Diaz, Brad Pitt, Bruno Ganz - each of them a reason to make a film in which they feature a 'must see'. And yet, this drama that takes place in the world of the cartels of drug traffickers at the border between Mexico and the United States, although well garnished with violence and sex, fails to capture and retain the attention of viewers and leaves an impression of confusion and of a terrible waste of talent.The 'counselor' (Michael Fassbender) is an ambitious lawyer whose name we never know. In the desire to raise his standard of living and to please his beautiful fiancée Laura (Penélope Cruz) he enters the service of the mob that transports drugs on both sides of the border. One of the transports goes wrong and the Counselor will be suspected by the Mexican drug cartel that he is reponsbile. The punishment for traitors is terrible. Moral decay and complicity in crime can only lead to disaster - this would be the not-so-subtle moral of this story.If the moral intention is obvious, the story is quite complex and could be interesting, but the way it is told makes it unnecessarily cryptic for viewers. The film is difficult to watch, many characters appear and disappear and not all of them have a reason to be on screen, there are no details that link the episodes of the story and give motivation to some of the characters' actions. I believe that to blame here is the fact that Cormac McCarthy's script (he is a valuable novelist, but for the first time a screenwriter) does not seem to have been - surprisingly - advised and corrected by the director to make the film clearer to the public. Maybe there was an intention that escapes me, but the fluidity of the story I was expecting from a director like Ridley Scott is missing. Worse, some of the main characters are reduced to being nothing more than their own stereotypes, including the two gangsters played by Javier Bardem and Brad Pitt. Penélope Cruz is a wasted talent in this film. The same can be said about Bruno Ganz, from whose role it seems that essential parts fell out on the editing table, parts which can be seen only in a special version of the director, but not in the standard distributions. Michael Fassbender copes quite well with the complex role of the Counselor, but I missed something in his interpretation as well, perhaps precisely because the moral of the story is too predictable. The most interesting role is that of Cameron Diaz, who seemed to me the only one who manages to transform Malkina's character from the gangster girlfriend into the pivot of the whole story. The concentration of talent involved in making this film far exceeds the result.",The Counselor
29,g-bodyl,Ridley Scott Is Better Than This!,6,30 December 2014,"Let me make clear right away that Ridley Scott's latest venture is not entirely awful as reviews seem to suggest, but I cannot but feel disappointed as The Counselor comes up limping. This film boasts a high-profile cast and a renowned screenwriter in Cormac McCarthy. My opinion is that McCarthy and Scott do not match. The main problem here is the story. It's dull, boring, and ultimately quite confusing. However, there are some very memorable scenes including one involving Brad Pitt's neck and a refreshingly disturbing sex scene involving a car. The cinematography, while bleak, effectively sets the tone for the film.Ridley Scott's film is about a dude referred to as the Counselor. The Counselor recently got engaged to his beautiful, traditional girlfriend. However, he feels that is not enough. He meets a drug kingpin named Reiner who puts him in the drug business. But of course things go very wrong and now The Counselor must fear for his and his loved one's lives.One of the strong points of the film is the acting, as they try to elevate the story. Michael Fassbender was decent as the Counselor, although his motives are left unexplained. Brad Pitt was excellent as the middle man and he has some of the best lines of the film. Javier Bardem and his crazy hair also was great. Penelope Cruz was decent as Laura, The Counselor's fiancée. Finally, Cameron Diaz was actually quite good and intimidating as Malkina, the girlfriend of Reiner.Overall, The Counselor could have been so much better. It has a great premise and cast plus a prestigious director. The one thing that held the movie down into mediocrity is the story that truly has no spark to it. It's a confusing mess, and that is being kind. McCarthy is an excellent writer, but not a great screenwriter. Although I did like some of the dialogue, which happens to be quite literary. Ridley Scott has done better films, but this isn't a total failure at least. The acting and the technical side to the film are worth noting. Plus don't forget about those cheetahs.

That is because as a reviewer I look for flaws -- much the same same way one of the characters in this film first looks at a diamond.And I found none.

As for the theme of the story, it was a phenomenal, but the screenplay is what failed very badly. To me, some of the scenes in the movie were impressive, enough to stick around the end. As has been a gangster related subject, Midas touch lacks and surprises how a great director make it slip away.Handling a tough situation, following the instinct and the facing outcome of the final result is what the movie to say in a one liner. Obviously, roles were perfectly distributed to the respective cast by the filmmakers and they had given their best as well. So no blame game for the movie's fall in that matter. In my perception it was the dull moments in the movie that acquire more than the best parts. When it was overhauled to build the story and develop characters, never showed signs of recovery.As I am a movie maniac, after seeing a movie, I always think of a sequel to follow only if it was a good one, or I pray for no sequel if it was terrible. I thought the same about this movie as well, after seeing the way it ended. I am now curious what if a sequel makes the way and impacts better than this. Because in the history, so many sequels had excelled than the previous movies.

Rambling on from scene to scene, The Counselor never once gives the audience any connection to its main players, and throughout the film one will be wondering more than once just exactly who is who or what is what giving the film a very nasty disjointed feel, and raises the question of exactly who is to blame for this mess? Straight off the bat some forgiveness must be paid to the actors who all do about as much as possible with their roles, although all have been seen on much better form in previous films. One actress however who cannot be excused is Cameron Diaz, who is surely just biding time until she picks up her Razzie award for an absolutely atrocious performance that includes this year's worst scene involving a hapless and innocent car windscreen. With the actors somewhat forgiven, the majority of the films atrocity's must fall upon (and I say this with regret) the great and legendary word smith Cormac McCarthy, whose script will also more than likely get the Pulitzer Prize winning author a Razzie. McCarthy's script is that of a man set on creating metaphorical and hypothetical jargon that looks to act as a deep and wise thesis on love, life and sin yet comes off as pretentious and weirdly amateurish.Director Ridley Scott has been in the cinematic doldrums for some years now, but all those that thought low points had been reached with such cinema scum like A Good Year, Robin Hood and the overblown mess that was Prometheus can now add The Counselor to that ever growing misfire list and perhaps sit it atop of Scott's worst films. With 2013 so far offering up more than its full quota of disappointing films one can only hope that such talent is not wasted in vain again, for once you have watched this film there is no coming back from its dark depths of horrible.1 catfish out of 5 For more movie reviews and opinions check out - www.jordanandeddie.wordpress.com",The Counselor

Scott is a big name in movies and maybe one of the finest visual director but his late movies (« Prometheus » is an « alien » copy) are just awful ! When i learn that this one was about a drug cartel, I was wondering what was the interest as it's the perfect boring topic (remember « blow »)! But Penelope was also in, so i tried it : the first scene involves her and like American movies now, it's a gratuitous sex scene ! What's the point to depict such intimacy ? I don't know ?? Next, the movie, always in those disgusting orange / blue colors, is supposed to tell a story and maybe i'm dumb but i'm still looking for it ! All this Hollywood cast just tell pseudo philosophical dumb lines about whatever ! They live like kings and queens and they think they know everything but they are just ridiculous, worthy of anything and expandable ! Their soup is only interrupted by another libidinous activity (Penelope & Diaz or Diaz & a car) and by scenes of gratuitous visual violence : like before, i'm still looking the motivation to organize such waste of time !

37,leonblackwood,Waste of a great cast! 3/10,3,24 May 2014,"Review: I didn't enjoy this movie at all. Everyone is talking in bloody riddles and the storyline got boring after a while. There was a sense of intensity throughout the movie which kept me interested for a while, but once the characters started the useless speeches about nothing, I totally wanted to switch it off. Ridley Scott really wasted a great cast, who are not to blame for the film because there performances wasn't to bad. It's really the concept that was disappointing and in some ways, boring. It's a shame, because I did have high hopes for the film after seeing the cast and the fact that Ridley Scott was directing it, but I was totally let down. Disappointing!Round-Up: Brad Pitt really hasn't made anything that amazing recently, which is a shame because the guy can act, but his bad choice of movies are becoming a bit of a habit. I did like his little cameo in 12 Years A Slave, which also starred Fassbender, but he hasn't headlined a blockbuster which has blown up the box office. As for Fassbender, well he is on fire at the moment. With the new X-Men coming out in the cinema and the weird Frank, which does look funny, I doubt that this disappointment with hurt the flow of his blossoming career. I did like Javier Bardem's character, who was a bit of a rich show off, but I wasn't that impressed with Diaz who was a complete bitch. Anyway, I was expecting much better from Ridley Scott.Budget: $25million Worldwide Gross: $71millionI recommend this movie to people who are into there crime, thriller about a drug deal the goes terribly wrong. 3/10",The Counselor
38,TheMovieDiorama,The Counsellor pretentiously advises that all actions have consequences.,3,11 February 2020,"The consequence of watching this heap of mess is that your precious time, patience and intelligence would all be wasted in a two hour ordeal where literally nothing cohesive occurs. Greed drives us to consequential behaviour. Greed makes us unlikeable. Greed, for a lack of better word, is actually bad. Forget 'Wall Street'! This sin leads to loss of life within a few days of manifestation! At least that's what McCarthy's pretentious dialogue alludes to, almost Shakespearean in theatrics. Yet somehow, somewhere, in production, Scott's mechanical directorial vision and McCarthy's bleak lessons in morality separated themselves like fire and ice. Two polar opposites that had no chance in forming a cohesive feature, marking an almighty low point in both careers.Much like the film's narrative, this ""review"" will be segments of wordy rambles that believe to have some self-importance attached to them (and yes, I did just insult my own work for comedic purposes). Nevertheless, the challenge to analyse this embarrassment has been accepted. After proposing to his girlfriend, a lawyer simply known as ""The Counsellor"" becomes entangled in a drug deal that rapidly becomes awry. Scott has some of the finest award-winning actors in his arsenal for The Counsellor. Michael Fassbender. Javier Bardem. Penelope Cruz. Brad Pitt. Cameron Diaz. Heck, even Bruno Ganz makes a brief appearance. Yet this exercise proves that no matter how much star power is thrusted into a project, the outcome is solely dependent on the director who provides the vision for audiences.Scott has been one of the most well-known, acclaimed and popular directors for decades. Tackling a variety of genres with effortless technicalities. So, the fundamental question raised here is: what the hell happened!?For starters, McCarthy's screenplay is riddled with existential monologues that attempt to illustrate the human condition. From a man who provides astute gothic South-Western thrillers, I'm astonished to witness how clumsily written this script was. Every choice in life has its outcomes, whether they are good or bad depends on the decision made. Aside from the odorous self-importance that overwhelms Scott's direction, his screenplay was absent of any structure. The drug deal unfolds without any direct inclusion whatsoever. You couldn't tell if Diaz rubbing her foo-foo on a car windscreen (more on that later, don't you worry) has anything to do with the central plot. I still don't know! Why was that even included?The point is, the basis of the story relied on scattershot narratives between a bunch of unlikeable characters that no one cared for. Talking about women as if they're pets. We're supposed to empathise with the titular ""Counsellor"", considering he risks the most and suffers with undeniable loss, but the bleak offset of detestable individuals produced zero emotional impact. Everyone's rich residing in lavish villas, driving luxury cars and taking pet cheetahs out for a walk. What's the point? If none of the characters are relatable, then no investment can be made.We then get to the drug deal itself, plagued with double-crossings and sly exchanges of envelopes brimming with dollar, which seemingly went south pretty quickly. But you wouldn't have known that without Pitt and Fassbender's heated conversation, because there had been no focus on the smuggling at all. Supporting characters are introduced in every direction, only to then leave the feature two minutes after their debut. Why? What's the point? They provided absolutely nothing to the plot, so why not just cut them out entirely and have a tighter story? It all comes down to this overwhelming burden of pretentiousness. This is not the Ridley Scott of 'Alien'. This is not the Cormac McCarthy of 'No Country For Old Men'. They are both in way over their heads.Frustratingly, the cast do give solid performances. Fassbender's breakdown in the car was magnificently performed. Pitt's cool swagger effortlessly shown. Bardem's crazy antics put firmly on display. Then we get to Diaz and that car scene. Did she not learn from dry-humping Timberlake in 'Bad Teacher'? Well, from what I can only describe as vehicular pleasure, she really did outdo herself. Honestly. It was disgusting. Thank God for my homo genes, that's all I'm saying!If there is one thing I hate in entertainment, it's wasted potential. The Counsellor is a prime example of wasted potential. It's a film that has no real purpose, no real technical merit, and certainly no solid storytelling. Just a mish-mash of unlikeable characters making bad greedy choices in life. And now I've made a bad choice too, by watching this...",The Counselor
39,matthewssilverhammer,"A bad script and strange directing don't help this confusing, self-important, hilariously ill-executed and supremely boring waste of some great talent.",1,2 November 2013,"In ""The Counselor"", there's a scene where Diaz goes to a confessional. As she intentionally makes the priest uncomfortable, he eventually refuses to put up with her games and leaves, while Diaz urges him to stay. Now imagine that Diaz is representing the film and the priest is representing the audience, and you have a pretty good idea of what seeing ""The Counselor"" is like: you want to leave, and it keeps begging you to stay. Despite a bevy of talent in director Scott, screenwriter Cormac McCarthy, and a skilled cast, this is a confusing, self-important, supremely boring and hilariously ill-executed bummer.It follows a group of bad people doing bad things. They live extravagantly and decadently, but it's never really explained how they got to this point.in fact, nothing in the plot is ever made clear. Instead, Scott and McCarthy spend all their time making sure we understand the childish philosophies of the characters through awkward, clunky dialogue. For a story centered on people trying to stay safe, there's no real sense of urgency. Instead, it lingers on these poorly written characters delivering hackneyed ideological dialogue. It's fine to have a conversation driven film, but the dialogue, characters, and/or mood must be more interesting or engaging .The few high points here are the cool weaponry, gorgeous landscapes and action scenes, and a doing-his-damnedest performance by Fassbender. Sadly, these get lost in the lifeless, bloated rubble, leaving moviegoers unwantedly asking themselves, ""What exactly is going on here?""",The Counselor
40,l_rawjalaurence,Not as Bad As Some Critics Have Claimed,7,20 November 2013,"The critical reception for THE COUNSELOR - in Britain at least - has been generally negative, with objections raised in particular to the film's awkward combination of static dialog and apparently excessive violence. This view seems particularly unfair, as Scott and writer Cormac McCarthy conduct a searching examination into the nature of sexuality. The action centers around a power struggle between different protagonists: two ""movers and shakers"" (Javier Bardem, Brad Pitt), one powerful female (Cameron Diaz) and the eponymous counselor caught in between them (Michael Fassbender), who tries his best to appease all of them while making a living for himself. As the action unfolds, each one of these main characters is disposed of, leaving only two at the end. By then we are left in no doubt as to who the strongest character actually is. Many of the film's set pieces - notably a scene where Diaz's character is shown making love to an automobile - are inspired by this desire for sexual and social mastery. With its Texan/ Mexican settings, THE COUNSELOR is very much reminiscent of other McCarthy films, notably NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN. However director Scott's visual style is very different to that of the Coen Brothers, with the emphasis placed on visual panoramas intercut with significant close-ups. There are certain places where the action slows to a halt, as the character engage in long passages of dialog, but once again these sequences can be seen as part of the characters' struggle for power. All in all an entertaining film - not perhaps one of Scott's greatest efforts, but worth a look at nonetheless.",The Counselor
41,Vartiainen,A story told through a wrong medium,5,16 June 2014,"Stephen King has stated that he once tried to write a radio play, but was forced to give it up when he realized he couldn't write it without it sounding like someone was reading one of his books aloud. He realized he was a novel author and wasn't suited for the job.This film, directed by Ridley Scott and written by novelist Cormac McCarthy, is a fine example of what that never-was radio play by King might have been like. It's extremely heavy on dialogue, sparse on action, very stationary and would have served better as a novel. It doesn't take advantage of the visual side of movies at all, a baffling failure on Scott's part, and tries to cram too much into its running time. This ends up meaning that none of the characters have clearly established motives, we don't identify with any of them and in the end we don't care what happens to them. They do talk a lot and some of those conversations are rather unique and interesting. And yet, there is a way to have a lot of dialogues in your movies without it seeming this tedious. Just look at Quentin Tarantino.All that being said, I cannot call it a bad film. The script isn't well-suited for film, but the story itself has merits. It's suitably dark and grizzly, doesn't pull its punches and even manages to surprise you every now and then. Plus, the cast is unbelievable. Michael Fassbender, Cameron Diaz, Javier Bardem, Penélope Cruz and Brad Pitt. This is what we call an ensemble cast and they're all utilized extremely well. Bardem's character is easily the most memorable, but they all give great performances.In the end this leaves us with a conundrum. Can a film be called any good if it isn't structured like a film? Do we have here a film or a visualized novel? Does it matter? Personally I think it comes down to a matter of taste. If you can deal with dialogues only, then this is an excellent dark thriller. But if you believe a film should be more than mouths flapping on screen, then this one might leave you a bit cold.",The Counselor
42,robert-temple-1,One of the most disgusting films ever made,1,21 January 2015,"This film is so disgusting, vulgar, immoral, and horrible in every way that in my opinion it ranks at the very bottom. No, I take that back, it is far below the bottom. Somewhere in some deep subterranean pit of evil, it writhes, a creature of the cesspit. Ridley Scott is the director, and if I could think of one good thing to say, I might consider doing so, but truly I believe the man needs professional help. I should make clear that I am talking about the extended director's cut as available on the DVD. I presume many of the most disgusting scenes must have been cut from the cinema version, or at least I hope so. One example of a scene of unrivalled depravity is the ludicrous scene where Cameron Diaz 'makes love to a car'. Javier Bardem complains that he has to wipe the vaginal fluid off with his socks before he can continue driving, and he criticizes her for being 'too gynaecological'. And do we not have enough decapitations in the real world at the moment without having to watch two of them in this film? In one scene, a man is riding a motorcycle and runs into a wire carefully strung across the road which neatly decapitates him. The killer then picks up the helmet, shakes the severed head out of it, which rolls along the road, and reaches up inside to find the concealed object he is looking for. He then drives away saying on the phone to his colleagues that he must get away quickly because there are bodies in the road (yes, there are always plenty of bodies strewn everywhere in this film). And then there is Brad Pitt who ingloriously agreed to play a part where we see him being decapitated and his head rolls along the street, but not before his carotid artery has been severed so that lots of blood spurts up like a fountain, and of course we have to see a close shot of Brad Pitt's hand with his fingers chopped off as well. This gore-fest of a film has no justification, it is merely a deranged series of visions of evil which ramble along in a kind of mad and meaningless sequence of extreme violence. All of the characters in the film are despicable people, drug dealers who deserve what they get, and they get plenty. Cameron Diaz plays an extremely evil plotter and betrayer, and she actually tries to be a psychopath because her character is one. We are meant to feel sorry for the other psychopaths whom she betrays because they, poor things, are a little bit less crazy and jollier than she is, whereas she simply has no sense of humour. Jolly, laughing Javier Bardem tries to create a likable drug dealing psychopath. Well, what a laudable ideal as an actor! Yes, why not aim so high as that? What on earth possessed all of these people including Penelope Cruz to appear in this despicable film? The salacious scene between Penelope Cruz and Michael Fassbender which appears before the credits is not only pointless, it is so crude and vulgar that Penelope Cruz has terminally demeaned herself by appearing in it. She was a nice wholesome girl before she went to Hollywood, told me she was a Buddhist. Well, that is some Buddhism. Having survived Scientology and Cruz, has she decided to try Satanism, perhaps? Since this film may well be the most horrible and vile film ever made, shall we award it the must suitable Anti-Oscar? I suggest one made of something unspeakable, which even Bardem's socks cannot deal with.",The Counselor
43,BeneCumb,"Protracted reasoning for the sake of ""deep"" movie",7,4 February 2014,"Evidently, Ridley Scott wanted to move on from long chases, explosions, shootings etc, to a more suspense thriller where characters have time and opportunity to present their views, particularly through dialogs. All this has worked well for Coen brothers and Steven Soderbergh, for example, but as for the movie in question, the outcome is too complex, lengthy, and with odd approaches, and - with the exception of Reiner perhaps - the characters lack wittiness and peculiarity the ones introduced by the Coens or Quentin Tarantino do always have. For example, it is difficult to believe that universal human relation issues are touched in a long phone conversation between a dishonest lawyer and drug lord... And there are twists in the plot the reason and nature of which was never explained.Thus, all this is probably the ""fault"" of the screenwriter, but somehow many good and famous actors expressed their desire to participate in this mediocre creation. But at least they played the movie better, and Reiner's part performed by Javier Bardem, and Malkina performed by Cameron Diaz are really different from their ""normal"" roles. Michael Fassbender, Penelope Cruz, Brad Pitt were good as well, although not so distinct. Some other good actors were somehow used in small roles only.All in all, The Counselor is an okay movie for the admirers of the said director and actors, but do not expect light and catchy entertainment, but a pseudo-erotic story where pondering on and over dominate clearly over thrilling moments.",The Counselor

45,meeza,Counseling madness or badness!!,5,22 March 2014,"""The Counselor"" was misguided in so many different ways that it needed some major counseling in effective filmmaking, very pronto!!! Director Ridley Scott, who by great scott is a legendary film auteur, should have canceled his ""counseling"" plans in helming this picture; this just might be the worst directorial effort in Scott's career. Ridley, believe it or not, but it's true. This atrocious movie stars Michael Fassbender as a (yea, you guessed it) a counselor lawyer who gets involved with some shady dealings involving luxurious diamonds, a Mexican cartel, and a nasty-looking murdering instrument. It's so ridiculous how everyone called our leading protagonist Counselor and not by his real name; It did not add any mystery to the character just some bad old formulaic tactic. The movie co-stars Javier Bardem as Reiner, a conniving businessman whose electric-follicle look reminds me of Young Einstein's cerebrally-challenged uncle. Cameron Diaz also gets into the counseling scene with her role as Malkina; Reiner's lady-friend who might or might not have some bad teaching up her sleeve to the counselor and many others. Penelope Cruz, Bardem's real life wife, also pops in here as the Counselor's girlfriend Laura. Brad Pitt, yes that Brad Pitt, is in the supporting plan also playing Westray, a west-end urban cowboy who ends up in one of the most outlandish gruesome gore scenes I have seen in a movie, and I mean that in a ""pitiful"" way; sorry Brad. Yes, these are all well-acclaimed actors who have shown their thespian worth, but not here. However, to give them the benefit of the doubt, they were all entrapped with a profoundly silly screenplay by Cormac McCarthy. Yes, that same McCarthy that wrote the great book ""No Country for Old Men"". Unfortunately, McCarthy's scribe of ""The Counselor"" was not meant to entertain any old or young men; and of course women. It has to be the worst screenplay of the year! Yes, I said it! Are you gonna excuse me now of McCarthyism!!! I am still trying to figure out what ""The Counselor"" was all about, not because it was a cerebral challenge but because it was cinematic bore. So my good counseling ""movie tip of the day"" is to not seek counseling from Ridley Scott's ""The Counselor"". ** Needs Improvement",The Counselor
46,estebangonzalez10,A 95% Cormac McCarthy film,6,8 November 2013,"""I'm pretty skeptical about the goodness of the good.""The Counselor is without a doubt one of the most divisive films of the year. It has received a lot of hatred, but at the same time some people absolutely loved it. I understand why this film has caused such a reaction because it doesn't follow your normal narrative structure and is heavy on the philosophical dialogues. I've liked most of Ridley Scott's films, I was one of the few who actually loved Prometheus, and I also think that Cormac McCarthy is a great novelist (No Country for Old Men being his masterpiece) so when I heard the two were going to work together I couldn't help but add this to my watchlist. My expectations took a blow when I read all the early reviews and so I went into this expecting a complete flaw. To my surprise it wasn't as bad as I was lead to believe (I can think of at least 50 films I've seen this year that are far worse) and I ended up slightly enjoying this. Despite its heavy loaded philosophical dialogues and lack of characterization, there are some great scenes in The Counselor and some great performances. This film easily has one of the most memorable murder scenes I've seen all year, but at the same time it has many scenes that really felt out of place (like the scene involving Cameron Diaz and the yellow Ferrari). The Counselor feels more like a McCarthy film than a Ridley Scott movie, and his dark humor and anti climatic scenes are all over the place here in this suspenseful thriller (if I can really call it that because it isn't really generic at all). The Counselor isn't an easy watch and at times it feels too preachy, but it kept my interest nonetheless. McCarthy's message about facing the consequences of your sins was loud and clear in The Counselor. The plot is pretty simple actually as the film focuses more on the dialogues than the actual events. Michael Fassbender plays a successful lawyer who is known simply as the Counselor. He falls deeply in love with Laura (Penelope Cruz), a girl of simple tastes, but in order to give her a dreamy life the Counselor decides to enter a one time deal involving drug trafficking. His business associate, the wealthy Reiner (Javier Bardem) who spends most of his time drinking expensive whisky in the mornings and watching his pet cheetahs hunt down rabbits, warns him about the dangers involved in this deal. Reiner has been in this business for a long time and knows how the cartel works, but the Counselor decides to team up with him nonetheless. Reiner's girlfriend, Malkina (Cameron Diaz), is a very smart woman who is kind of shady as Reiner never knows what she is up to. The middle man involved in the transaction between the cartel and Reiner is Westray (Brad Pitt) who also warns the Counselor about the world he's getting himself into. The deal is an apparently simple one as the cartel uses Reiner's trucks to carry the drugs to Chicago, but an unfortunate accident puts everyone's life in danger.The Counselor, who ironically in this film is always receiving advice from everyone, learns that greed isn't a good thing. The film focuses on greed and evil, but there is way too much talking at times which makes it feel too preachy at times. I think that much of the criticism this film is receiving has to do with the high expectations that people had about it considering the talented cast and crew involved int his film. Michael Fassbender, Javier Bardem, and Brad Pitt actually lift this film in my opinion and make their characters bearable to watch on screen. These characters aren't people we would care for in any other film, but the actors make it tolerable. I especially liked Fassbender in this film and I think he gives yet another powerful performance. The weakest link here was Cameron Diaz who never felt natural in my opinion, but that perhaps was part of McCarthy's plan. She isn't as strong as Bardem was in No Country for Old Men, but she kind of plays that same character that McCarthy tends to include in his novels. This is the first time that McCarthy writes an original screenplay since the other films were based on his novels, and this is definitely more his film than Scott's. If you are a fan of his work than you will probably like this film more than other people. I think one of the key McCarthy moments can be seen through Ruben Blades's monologue about how our decisions ultimately set our fate. There are just too many memorable scenes in this film for me not to give it a passing grade. The Counselor isn't an easy watch, but if you go into it with your expectations lowered you might actually be in for a surprise.",The Counselor

48,jimbo-53-186511,Proof that a good cast doesn't always result in a good film,4,11 February 2015,"***********THIS REVIEW IS BASED ON THE EXTENDED CUT*************Michael Fassbender plays The Counsellor, a wealthy lawyer who is due to marry his fiancée Laura (Penelope Cruz). However, these plans go on the back burner when The Counsellor gets involved in a drug trafficking operation. A serious of events occur which puts him and everyone around him on the wrong side of The Cartel.Even though the idea behind this film isn't particularly new, I'm not the sort of person who will put the boot into a film just because it isn't original. However if it isn't original then the writers should try to help their audience forget this by at least telling their story in a way that is both entertaining and interesting - this fails on both counts. For me, the story is far too talky and nonsensical. The first hour probably consisted of about 55 minutes of rambling and about 5 minutes of plot development (that's probably being generous as well). There were lots of scenes that were either drawn out or pointless (or both on some occasions) - the scene where The Counsellor buys a diamond ring, the scene with Diaz and Bardem and the Ferrari. You could also add the opening scene as being a long drawn out pointless scene, but I'm prepared to let that one slide because Penelope Cruz is hot. There was so much rambling and pointless dialogue with very little plot development that it pretty much gets to the point where you're past caring what's happening.Brad Pitt is supposed to be an integral part of the operation, but he's probably only on screen for about a fifth of the running time (and most of that time is towards the end of the film).The film's very basic strengths are in that it is ultra cool and slick. The cast are all cool and the film is also quite well-made and also contains some rather nice cinematography.Sadly though, a handsome cast and some pretty visuals & sets aren't going to be enough for most viewers and unfortunately without these things you're left with a rather incoherent rambling mess of a film that takes so long to go anywhere that you'll find yourself past caring long before the film ends. It's a bit like looking at a really beautiful painting - you'll start off looking at it, enjoy looking at it for a short while, but eventually you'll get fed up and walk away. Those were pretty much my exact feelings when the film ended. A bit of a waste really.",The Counselor

However, because of the very poor reviews and box office performance Stateside, I have tempered my expectations before I went to see it. And so should you.""The Counselor"" refers to the nameless character played by Michael Fassbender. He appears to be a very successful lawyer, happily engaged to a gorgeous, church-going girl (Penelope Cruz). However, for some reason this film never really completely discloses, he still felt the need to get himself involved with a Mexican drug cartel for additional cash, peppered with colorful characters, like the wild-haired Reiner (Javier Bardem), his slinky girlfriend Malkina (Cameron Diaz) and the urban cowboy Westray (Brad Pitt). Will the Counselor get away with both the girl and cash?When I saw in the opening credits that the script was by Cormac McCarthy, who was responsible for ""No Country for Old Men"" (which I did not exactly like), I braced myself for one puzzling and boring ride.However, it was not exactly all boring after all. There were those pockets of incredible tension and violence involving necks which you will not soon forget. Michael Fassbender was okay as the titular Counselor, but there was nothing about his character which was fully-explored. He is obviously greedy enough to risk everything he had to get himself involved in nefarious criminal activities, but we do not see why. So we end up not caring at all about him. We actually see other characters counsel him, than him counseling others.Cameron Diaz's femme fatale character Malkina was unexpectedly well- developed. She is certainly no dumb blond bimbo here. Her scenes though were the most perplexing as to where she was coming from. She has a scene on the windshield of a luxury car that was as head-scratching as it was sensually acrobatic.Javier Bardem is really very comfortable playing these cool sinister types. Penelope Cruz is too good to be true. I expected more out of their characters than what ended up in the final edit we saw, which was disappointing.I found the character of Brad Pitt the most interesting one of all. Every time Westray was on the screen, the story perks up and even the long conversations he has with the Counselor actually made sense. Too bad Pitt was only in about a third of the film or less.""The Counselor"" comes across as a slick action-filled crime caper film at first glance. However as you watch it, you will realize that it was actually mostly long-winded, unrealistically philosophical conversations and monologues from the most unlikely of characters.

The specific details of what triggers his fall are not clear, and they might be irrelevant because it's all to be interpreted by some key bits of dialog, particularly in his conversations with Pitt, Blades, and his interaction with Bardem.The biggest revelation is the strength of Diaz's performance. She unleashes erotic and intelligent magnetism. She uses her body, in particular her hands and her posture. The camera also loves her eyes, as they taunt and intimidates those who surround her and tease the audience because we sense she is hiding something very dark, and yet, it also feels like she really never has to lie. From her perspective, you create your own destiny, with little room to act weak if you expect to succeed. Her manipulations are the key to understanding the title, and the final ten minutes in the film are bound to elevate this actress to a new level. She reminded me of Theron's force in ""Monster"" since Diaz is just a different type of evil, just a more strikingly gorgeous one who knows no boundaries in this type of environment.Sit, watch, and be prepared to see some darkness in the most unexpected places.",The Counselor
51,peterp-450-298716,A dead boring first hour and an impressive ending,4,17 February 2014,"A man would give entire nations to lift grief off his heart and yet, you cannot buy anything with grief, because grief is worthless.This is a difficult movie to rate. I have mixed feelings about it. The first part is terribly tedious and boring. A series of hugely pretentious dialogues and incomprehensible philosophical reasoning. It is a montage of various fragmentary issues that make it difficult to sense the vibe of the movie and to understand what it's about. Also there are subjects used that were completely beside the point in my eyes (the erotic beginning for starters). Also the total absence of any explanation of how they ended up in this situation, makes it uneasy to follow the storyline.Ridley Scott, of course known for his masterpieces ""Blade Runner"" and ""Alien"",didn't succeed in keeping up the momentum. You first need to endure a full hour to finally realize what the contents of the movie is and after that you can enjoy a rough settlement by the drug cartel. And that's the double feeling about this film. The first part gets a unsatisfactory grade. The second part is the counterbalance.In terms of characters Brad Pitt tops them all. A savvy person with a reserved and confident attitude that apparently has everything well organized. When something starts to go wrong, he can disappear instantly and retire for the rest of his life. His white suit and Stetson on his long hair gives him a dignified appearance and a rebellious appearance at the same time. Michael Fassbender as ""The Counselor"" was convincing as a lawyer , but what the hell is he doing among those criminals ? He looks like a choirboy who will start to cry when slapped in his face. This is also something that is not really clear . How did he end up with the drug lord Reiner ? Is he also a kind of counselor as Tom Hagan in ""The Godfather"" ? I don't think so. He would earn enough money and wouldn't be involved in the drug deal that ultimately will bring him down. Money problems perhaps ? I don't think so either since he can travel all the way to Amsterdam to choose a diamond.Javier Bardem was also brilliant as the eccentric Reiner. He looked just like a tanned Tom Jones. Cruz played only a minor role and she was just a religious prude naive woman who was constantly upset by the others. The only one I hated instantly, was Cameron Diaz. She is as hot as a typical non-functional oven and she's clearly getting older resulting in slight hanging skin at some places. Besides the fact that she plays a dual role in a sly way, she tries to shock sexually, with as highlight the sticky wet routine on the windshield of Reiner's car.The story on its own is dead simple and it doesn't need 2 hours to be told. It took so miserable long because of the dialogues as mentioned earlier . It was terribly annoying after a while . Even with subtitles in English , it didn't make any sense to me sometimes. Everybody seemed like having an academically degree in languages. It seemed as if they had to transform every dialogue into an anthology of an intellectual high level with a lot of difficult words. Even the drug baron Reiner and someone from the drug cartel used those intricate descriptions. They sound so philosophical that I doubt they could understand themselves. A fragment of the Dutch diamond expert sounds as follows : ""To partake of the stone's endless destiny, is that not the meaning of adornment? To enhance the beauty of the beloved is to acknowledge both her frailty and the nobility of that frailty. At our noblest, we announce to the darkness that we will not be diminished by the brevity of our lives."". Even after reading it three times again, i still can't understand the deeper meaning .The most impressive scene was the liquidation of Brad Pitt. It was filmed fairly explicit and gruesome. The best dialogue was between Pitt and Fassbender about Snuff movies. The funniest thing was the fact that they twice used a joke that's often told here amongst friends. The one the motorcyclist told about the dog food. The second about the Pope in Mexico. Funny to experience that.Final conclusion: an intricate dead boring first hour as a precursor to a quite impressive offensive end. Ultimately, on average, it is still not sufficient.More reviews at http://opinion-as-a-moviefreak.blogspot.be/",The Counselor
52,dierregi,"Yes, it is THAT bad - cautionary tale about not messing with Mexican drug lords, as if one easily get a chance...",1,30 November 2014,"The movie opens with a sex scene which is simultaneously excessive and boring. The Cruz character, named Laura, asks to be pleasured ""down there"" and the Fassbinder character, the nameless Counselor, obviously obliges.Follows a series of disjointed and disconnected scenes, to introduce the other main players: Reiner, a Mexican drug trafficker with a bad haircut; Malkina, a ""femme fatale"" with a weird name and attitude and Westray, a guy who knows other guys.All these people are played by top of the crop actors, directed by Ridley Scott, with a screen play by Cormac MCCarthy and yet the final result is an overlong, bloated, boring movie.The plot involves a vague, messy drug deal and an even vaguer involvement of the Counselor. As everybody who watched Breaking Bad knows, Mexican drug lords get very upset when somebody messes with their drugs, so rightful revenge ensues.Unfortunately, in this case the revenge is not fair and the Mexican guys should know. In one of many weird scenes, we see a main player spying a conversation between the Counselor and Reiner, during which it is spelled out that the Counselor is innocent. And yet the ax will fall on him and on his beloved Laura.The violence is disturbing but predictable. When Reiner and the Counselor coolly discus about decapitation devices, you can be sure that someone will be decapitated before the end credits. The same when they talk about snuff movies Cameron Diaz playing femme fatale Malkina is especially disturbing. Sporting appropriate sprayed-on clothes and super high-heels, with huge sculpted cheekbones, she is supposed to convey fear and mystery. But I just found her cheekbones too distracting to be afraid.",The Counselor
53,jadepietro,Disbarred,2,30 October 2013,"This film is not recommended.Even with its line-up of big name stars, a distinguished director at the helm, and a first-time screenplay by renown novelist, Cormac McCarthy, the majority of critics have universally panned The Counselor unmercifully. But was all the negativity justified?Yes, and then some.The Counselor is a mess. With its over-convoluted plotting, repellent characters, and graphic violence, the film never makes much sense. The story is baffling and pretentious as various acts are set in motion in a multitude of places: In Mexico, a shipment of cocaine is on route to the United States. In Amsterdam, a man (Michael Fassbender), only known as ""the Counselor"", is buying an engagement ring for his sweet and loving girlfriend (Penelope Cruz). In Texas, a party is hosted by a rich drug dealer named Reiner (Javier Bardem) and his kinky, slinky gal named Malkina (Cameron Diaz). Later, the Counselor meets a business associate named Westray (Brad Pitt) and wants in on the drug deal. Of course, we know that something must go wrong to up the ante and it does. Of course, we also know when there's talk about snuff films, be-headings, and garrote devices, there's a strong chance that those things will somehow be a part of the story, and it does. (Let's face it, those subjects rarely come up in one's average conversation, at least, with my social crowd.)So many characters are introduced, centrally used in one or a few scenes and never seen again. By the film's end, none of the character's motives or criminal activity is ever really explained to one's satisfaction. They all speak in banal platitudes and purple prose, spouting philosophic ramblings that one would never hear in any real life situation. Some examples of ripe dialog: ""The truth has no temperature."" / """"You cannot buy anything with grief because grief is worthless"" / and my particular favorite, ""I liked to forget Malinka f**king my car"". (Yes, this does actually happen in an unintentional laughable scene with Ms. Diaz spreadeagled on the hood of a Ferrari and gyrating into orgasmic ecstasy with a shocked Bardem gaping at her positions, looking ultra bug-eyed and perplexed. (Almost, and I said almost, worth the price of admission.) The actors involved throw themselves into their roles, especially Ms. Diaz, all bedecked in leopard tattoos, gaudy jewelry, and the tightest of form-fitting outfits. Truth be told, it is a fierce and bold performance by the actress. Fassbender is also good in the title role. Just as his character remains nameless, this fine actor is blameless for his participation in this misfire. Pitt plays his supporting role with some flair, but Ms. Cruz is used as mere window dressing. Also wasted in their non-existent roles are such talented actors as Ruben Blades, Natalie Dormer, Dean Norris, Rosie Perez, and John Leguizamo. Ridley Scott livens up this crime drama with some solid direction and production values are strong. The director delivers a well-crafted film, but why this film was ever made remains a mystery. The fault must go entirely to McCarthy's incredulous script, a screenplay lacking in any character or story development. Perhaps, on the written page, the whole enterprise seemed like a good idea. But on the big screen, the film is just an incoherent and joyless exercise in style. The Counselor simply needs a lot more guidance.

54,burlesonjesse5,"The Counselor is weirdly sophisticated and Michael Fassbender in the lead, well he's so good he holds the screen in the palm of his hand",7,9 May 2014,"Every aspect of the 2013 release The Counselor (minus the philosophically damned script), tells you that this is a Ridley Scott film. If you enjoy the way he carefully directs by bringing scenes to a slow creep and then having things interrupted with an act or two of brutal violence, then this will satisfy you, the fan of said director. I have to say that initially I had become bored with the first 30 minutes or so of this slick, trashy (might as well throw in stylized) sort of 2 hour resembling of a cable TV drama (rated for mature audiences of course). It started off as pretentious and self indulgent. You have actors constantly engaging in conversations with each other that go on longer than needed. And the dialogue is all about the meaning of life and such. Therefore, I kept thinking to myself, why does everyone in this vehicle have to be so smart? Although the performances were substantial (with the exception of the continuously miscast Cameron Diaz), it seemed as though the script required almost all the cast members to be Socrates (the supposed founder of Western philosophy).Brought to life by rookie screenwriter Cormac McCarthy (his novices shows in his screen writing even though he's a well accomplished novelist) and dedicated to Ridley Scott's brother (famed director Tony Scott) who committed suicide during filming, The Counselor examines a lawyer who on the side, gets involved in drug dealings with the Mexican cartel. Hoping to get a huge return back and taking different angles of advice from a drug kingpin named Reiner (played with a goofy stature and an even goofier haircut, by Javier Bardem), ""Counselor"" (he has no name, this is what everybody calls him) eventually gets in way over his head. He is warned by a middleman named Westray (played by Scott veteran Brad Pitt) that such a deal might be the wrong path to be taken. Furthermore, it doesn't help that he puts his I guess, pregnant wife (Laura played by Penelope Cruz) in harm's way throughout. Let me put it this way, I found myself more embroiled with The Counselor's fate as every other character begin to die off. I read a separate review that said this motion picture was sort of a dark neo-noir. By definition, neo-noir films deal with social ramifications so I guess that critic pretty much got it right.Anyway, if you can get past the gnawing characteristic of the aforementioned tainted screenplay, then you'll find that this movie barrels along by becoming more intriguing and to a fault, more involving. You realize that Scott knows that there is a problem with the script (he didn't write it), but he decides to be in complete control of the camera anyway. He directs with confidence and funnels little nuggets here in there from his other movies, plastering them into this one. His cast is vast and diligent (a couple of cameos by some notable screen talents). He films sequences either from a long distance away or close up with two actors trading words in a small, claustrophobic space. Last but certainly not least, he puts a relatively unknown yet well seasoned Michael Fassbender in the lead role. Known in this flick as simply ""The Counselor,"" he is able to carry the whole 2 hour running time quite well. He's in almost every frame (Fassbender looks a little like a young Jeremy Irons and has Ewan McGregor's manneristic smirk) and goes toe to toe with some big name actors (Brad Pitt anyone) that seem to fade in and out of the proceedings. In the end, you don't quite know what the future has in store for him. But you get a sense that his character is the type of person who falls prey to the notion of bad things happening to not so bad people.All and all, The Counselor as a movie, likes to leave little tracings of symbolism here and there (especially in the opening scene). Its intentions are to let you know that it has deeper interludes that extend far beyond the simple art of a drug deal. Yes, there are little flaws that are evident (some of the dialogue is borderline laughable and cringe worthy) but in the end, it still comes off as weirdly sophisticated. It's for the moviegoer who can hold his or her attention span and not harbor to all the disposable drivel that's thrown in year after year (stuff like remakes of classics which I've been ripping on since March). To be honest, I don't know if I would put this thing on my top ten list of 2013. However, it resonates with you minutes after you see it. And that's something I look for when I want to garner a recommendation. It also has the type of ending shot that I like where the camera focuses on a main character's face, and then goes suddenly to blackout (without any type of fading). With The Counselor, you get a mostly trademark Ridley Scott film and heck, usually he's incapable of making anything mediocre. Halfway into the second act when things get dangerous, Brad Ptit's character states, ""I'd say it's pretty bad, then muliply it by ten."" Yeah, I'd say this flick is not so bad so I'll just add three stars.",The Counselor

56,moviexclusive,"An artificial exercise in phony eloquence, this crime thriller suffers from the weight of novelist Cormac McCarthy's own expository indulgences",4,28 November 2013,"Cormac McCarthy's 'No Country for Old Men' may have made a gripping Coen brothers crime thriller, but his first produced screenplay after earning the love of Hollywood from subsequent adaptations like 'The Road' and 'All the Pretty Horses' proves that it is one thing to be a writer and quite another to be a screenwriter. Indeed, the characters in his self- penned 'The Counselor' not only talk a lot (and we might add, too much), they also do so with such pretentiousness that it's hard to imagine any of them actually inhabiting more than a McCarthy novel. The titular character remains unnamed throughout the film, but Michael Fassbender plays him as a respectable American lawyer who is tempted by his financial circumstance to enter into some illegal business involving a Mexican cocaine cartel. The overwritten script brings in a whole lot of other characters with shady motivations – there's Javier Bardem's Reiner, a business partner of the counsellor who is instrumental in hooking him up with the wrong people; Reiner's girlfriend Malkina (Cameron Diaz) who turns out even more conniving and malevolent than Reiner himself; and last but not least, Westray (Brad Pitt), a shadowy figure whose involvement remains obtuse throughout the movie.McCarthy's idea of building character relationships is to get them to engage in lengthy conversations and wax philosophically about his signature themes of greed, death, choices and consequences. The eloquence however rings phony and hollow, sounding exactly as if a writer typed them – though admittedly if listening to lines like ""truth has no temperature"" from Diaz when she is accused of being ""cold"" gets you tingling, then you will be in for a treat. Otherwise, the dialogue is affected as can be, not least because there are at least two lengthy expositions on morality, mortality, regret and even Heavenly redemption.In the midst of all that capital W writing, the venerable Ridley Scott seems genuinely lost and befuddled. There is hardly any visual momentum to the scenes when all the characters are doing are primarily talking, and because the manner in which they talk makes it seem as if they could go on and on, the transitions in between scenes feel awkward and unwieldy. In between, Scott prettifies the images to show off his character's lavish lifestyles, which his 'Prometheus' cinematographer Dariusz Wolski ensures are a sight to behold. But when he does get a break from the prose, Scott indulges the borderland noir with casual violence, staging not one but two bloody beheadings that we warn you are pretty graphic.Speaking of beheadings, you probably won't care much for one of them, but the other, set in a busy street in the heart of London, will probably take you by surprise – not just for how bloody it is, but also why that said actor would agree to such a sequence. But we suspect, most of the actors probably signed on because of the pedigree, and then realised how lacking in clarity and plausibility the script was. Still, they make the best of what they have, though in different ways. Fassbender tries hard to convince, but his earnest intentions are somewhat undermined by the sheer cartoonish nature of Bardem's over-the- top getup as well as Diaz's similarly overdone femme fatale.And so despite a script by a Pulitzer prize winner, a terrific ensemble cast and Ridley Scott at the helm, 'The Counselor' is a frustrating example of under fulfilled potential. One sort of guesses what McCarthy intended with this screenplay, but his own indulgence and lack of familiarity with the language of film just makes this a writer's exercise and nothing more. It isn't Scott nor the cast's fault that the movie unfolds with a distinct lack of drama, urgency or purpose. Like we said at the beginning, it's one thing to be a good writer and quite another to be a good screenwriter. McCarthy clearly isn't yet a jack of both trades.",The Counselor
57,Sergeant_Tibbs,Pleasantly surprising considering the bad reputation it's getting.,7,9 December 2013,"""Cormac McCarthy's first original screenplay directed by Ridley Scott."" Legends colliding. Hopes were unashamedly high, and that doesn't even account for its star-studded cast with Michael Fassbender, Brad Pitt, Cameron Diaz, Javier Bardem and Penelope Cruz. In the early months of 2013, Oscar predictions for Best Picture were not without The Counsellor, some even for the win. No Country For Old Men is both an instant classic and still in recent memory, yet McCarthy didn't win a trophy for that and Scott still hasn't won Best Director, despite one of his films winning Best Picture. I was guilty of having it as my most anticipated of the year at one point. But then people saw it, and all was lost. Not only was it disliked, but hated, called the worst of the year. Could it really be that bad? The trailers came in and I started to believe it. The acting looked laughable, the production inconsistent and the story uninspired. I lost interest.I ended up going anyway due to my 2013 obligation but with extremely low expectations. Fortunately, the first thing that struck me is that it was absolutely dripping with atmosphere. Ridley Scott's last film Prometheus suffered severely from its script, but I forget how impressive it was at least visually. The Counsellor too has great suspenseful cinematography. However, as my fears suggested, it isn't consistent. There are some dialogue-driven scenes where it felt amateur in the way it was shot and edited. Perhaps they were the victim of not enough time on the day of the shoot but that's no excuse. It results in a film that feels rough, loose and raw, which benefits its themes, but it does feel a little unprofessional. At least the good scenes lift the whole film up. It is a clichéd premise in many ways but it approaches the story in a very different way. This is McCarthy's comfort zone, and his comfort zone subverts all expectation.However, its main flaw is the eponymous counsellor. The one mystery the film does not solve is what he had to do with the central crime and that's a big mistake. His characterisation is paper thin until the last third where we see glimpses of how far he'll go to survive, which is just a few lies. Fassbender really struggles and too often feels out of tune with the rest of the film, taking me out of the moment. It could have worked as if he was like an idyllic child in a man's body but that should have been established more. Otherwise I was pleasantly surprised to find myself intrigued with the other characters, particularly Javier Bardem, of whom feels like a caricature at first and is suddenly humanised in the most hilariously bizarre way from the infamous Diaz car sex scene, of whom was close to delivering the performance that was hyped for us earlier this year if not for her voice which still sounds like she's 20. Takes a lot away from the character.What really makes The Counsellor is its profound existential ideas on death. There's a great phonecall scene from a one off character who talks about the last few days before death and its inevitability. What can someone do in that situation? Perhaps Fassbender's mistimed tears are accurate. While many people may die in the film, in memorable gruellingly sinister scenes at that which are a break from the dialogue-driven ones, it only takes one seemingly insignificant death for the others to spiral out of control. A lot to chew on. The Counsellor is an unusual, flawed yet endearing film that feels like it's living in its own little world. It's a disappointment from earlier expectation but a pleasant surprise from that vicious initial reaction due to its shining strengths. All I have to say is, if you truly know McCarthy you should see that ending coming.7/10",The Counselor
58,tomsview,Counseling required,3,18 April 2014,"Sometime before I saw it, I read a scathing review of ""The Counselor."" The critic thought the movie inept, and particularly disliked Cameron Diaz's car love scene, stating that Ridley Scott had lost his filmmaking touch. Now that I have seen the movie, I think he had a point.The story concerns a lawyer - a counselor - played by Michael Fassbinder who gets involved in a serious drug deal with help from his business partner, Reiner (Javier Bardem), and another associate, Westray (Brad Pitt). Cameron Diaz plays Reiner's scheming girlfriend Malkina, and Penélope Cruz plays the counselor's girlfriend, Laura, the only innocent person in the story.Hollywood loves movies about drug dealers, in fact, movies featuring drug cartels have replaced movies about the mafia - when was the last time you saw a movie featuring the mafia? Anyway, along the way, Mexican drug cartels become involved with dire consequences for the counselor. From that point on it's all about everyone getting their just desserts - or nearly everyone.In dealing out such a succession of punishments, Ridley puts the viewer in the position of the crowds that attended public hangings at Newgate Prison or those that watched heads roll off the guillotine during the French Revolution. And speaking of heads rolling, doesn't Ridley love a decapitation? This is becoming a trademark if ""The Counselor"" and ""Prometheus"" are anything to go by.Although much of what happens is hard to follow, a couple of sequences in the film are actually exciting. I was beginning to wonder what annoyed that critic so much, but then the movie meandered on without much change of tone - except for Cameron's 'scène d'amour d'auto'. The film also finishes with a particularly blah ending. I won't spoil it for anyone who hasn't seen it - Ridley has already taken care of that.Even movies as heavy as this need a lighter touch here and there, and maybe a little wit. However, one thing I've noticed about Ridley's movies is that he doesn't do light and he doesn't do funny. The truth is that he handles sombre historical epics and science fiction opuses better than he does urban thrillers and dramas. ""Matchstick Men"" worked, but it was such a good idea (from a novel), that it would have been hard to screw it up.As for Cameron Diaz having sex with the car? It's a bit like the shower scene in Psycho, you don't really see much, and it's only Bardem's narration that fills in the details. I don't think it is as ridiculous as some critics suggest, but it is tasteless. I wouldn't have felt comfortable if I was on a first date when that unfolded on the screen.""The Counselor"" is a downer. I am amazed that concerns weren't raised that could have changed its course before it hit the screen. I think we get a little snarly about movies that bomb when we have such high expectations of the filmmakers. In all honesty, unlike ""Prometheus"", which also seemed to disappoint the fans, ""The Counselor"" is so irrelevant and forgettable that it may not stain Ridley Scott's reputation too much at all.",The Counselor
59,intelearts,563rd Review: Crime and Punishment,6,18 May 2014,"The Counsellor is more than simply a film about drugs and drug deals - it has characterization and design. The stories criss-cross and form a whole and it a fascinating watch with a superb cast. While Ridley Scott never manages the multiple story lines with complete mastery it is a deeply fascinating film about the nature of how corruption, greed and mega-wealth all warp these protagonists into a schizophrenic norm of unimaginable hedonism and a palpable paranoia where life as a moral imperative really holds no sway. This is a film that has depth and meaning, though it does clearly lack clarity - and it is certainly one of the more interesting films about a multi-billion dollar industry that uses up humans at all stages without a thought. It does remain a very good watch. While it is clearly not the greatest crime movie ever made - it is a surprisingly thoughtful and original look at the top echelons of the drug world at work and play.This is Ridley Scott's 32nd outing as a director - he has been directing films now since the 1960s and several: Thelma and Louise, Blade Runner, Gladiator are iconic. However, his crime movies: Black Rain (Yakuza 1980s), American Gangster (Harlem 70s) and now The Counsellor (Mexican Cartels) don't hit home in the same way. Let me straight out say, this is not, in any sense a bad movie but compare this to Scorsese's deep understanding of the criminal as an integral part of the American story and we sense that Scott enjoys telling stories but his focus is never as clear. The fault here maybe that Scott wants us to care all along about his characters in a way that Scorsese never does - and so loses the absolute impact that the inevitable implosion deserves.This is a crime film worth your time: Fassbinder, Bardem, Cruz, Diaz, and Pitt are not acting light here - there is depth, some would argue too much and I get that, but this is a film that takes up deeper into the mindset of their world than most, and it is worth your time.",The Counselor
60,krocheav,The Counselor Is Losing This Case,3,18 November 2017,"Seems most audiences that fell for this one needed a counselor to unravel the mess it left in their heads. For a mainstream movie, they don't come much grubbier than this. I've never understood the regard some folk hold for director Ridley Scott, who proves with this shoddy work how overrated he can be. As for highly esteemed writer Cormac McCarthy - perhaps at 84 it's time to hang up his pen. Character motivation is largely unexplored and the situations bounce from one glib, almost impossible to understand circumstance to the next. The highest ideals for any of these characters run in the order of greed, avarice, booze, drugs and obsessive sexual obscenity of the most perverse nature. Cameron Diaz is beginning to look as ugly as the foul morality she tends to represent, Penelope Cruz basically appears to represent little more than a woman for a bed - shared by Michael Fassbender in an unnecessarily overdone opening section. Brad Pitt's by-the-numbers role is not much more than a station on the way and could have gone to any number of lesser names. Fassbender's ridiculous decision to play for deathly high stakes with merciless drug cartels offering a deal with a 4000 x return rate (yes you read right!) at least it gives him a chance to show some fear- filled remorse - with possibly one of the better performances in this jigsaw puzzle with too many missing pieces. If your most endearing inspirations for living are superficial greed, perverse sexuality, fashion, drugs or how many people you can cruelly murder, then you could find something to identify with here. Otherwise, save your brain and time, find something else to watch and leave this to the criminal element and biker gangs but, even they may prefer to go ridin'.",The Counselor

They are fascinating to watch because you could view the pure evil it takes to get drugs into the hands of Americans from Mexico. The criminality is so vicious, and the casualties continuously occur like minutes in the day.This film is good. There are long, long conversations that are highly philosophical. They may not relate to drug cartels directly, but it is moreso related to man and lengths he would go to to achieve what he wants in life. Cameron Diaz is breathtaking and gives a chillingly haunting role. Watch her throughout the movie. The rest of the cast is excellent and push the story forward.

What on earth could go wrong? After sitting in a state of bored bemusement for 117 minutes watching this mess, the answer is clearly quite a lot. Ostensibly a sexy, gritty crime thriller, but in fact a frustratingly oblique drama about greed, sex and power, The Counselor sees Fassbender's out-of-his-depth lawyer chased by a ruthless Mexican drug cartel after a deal goes sour. A few rare memorable sequences - Diaz ""appreciating"" a luxury car, a deserted-road shootout - can be found, and Dariusz Wolski's cinematography is superb, yet it's impossible to really enjoy, or engage, thanks to the smothering pretentiousness of Cormac McCarthy's first original screenplay. The story aims for an unrelentingly grimy realism à la No Country For Old Men (adapted from McCarthy's novel), however comes off as forced, silly and entirely false. The first rate cast are fine, with Pitt's enigmatic middle-man and Diaz's sultry schemer standing above the rest, but the extended supporting cast - Edgar Ramirez, Toby Kebbell, Bruno Ganz, et al - are completely wasted in glorified cameos.

63,brchthethird,"Well-produced by Ridley Scott's standards, but with an overly talky and ponderous script by Cormac McCarthy",6,14 November 2014,"THE COUNSELOR is a visually stunning movie with good performances by its star-studded cast, but the overly talky nature of the film made it feel like a collection of scenes rather than a cohesive movie. The story is rather simple: An unnamed lawyer, referred to only as ""Counselor"" (Fassbender) gets more than he bargains for when he enters into a one-time drug deal. Most of the movie is composed of these philosophically heady conversations and salacious anecdotes. While I would expect a movie to have some of these attributes, having a movie almost entirely composed of them starts to wear down on you a little bit. Fortunately, there were a few moments that moved the story along. Even still, they were few and far between (especially with the extended cut I watched). One part I thought was slightly miscast was Cameron Diaz as Malkina, Reiner's (Bardem) cheetah-loving mistress. There was an icy quality to her character and performance, but I didn't really buy her as somebody who wasn't American (she was supposed to be Argentinian). There are also several glorified cameo roles where they show up, talk for a little bit and then exit the picture. Most of the what they said had nothing to do with the story at all, and only served as mouthpieces for Cormac McCarthy's heavy-handed dialogue. Speaking of the dialogue, the script was the first one written by McCarthy directly for the screen, and it shows. He may be a high-caliber novelist, but he sorely needed someone to keep his style in check (like the Coen Bros. on NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN). Ridley Scott did an impeccable job as usual in delivering a visually compelling film, with a few great action sequences (as well as one scene with Cameron Diaz which I will not spoil...suffice it to say, you won't have seen anything like it before). However, the script supporting it just isn't disciplined enough to the make the movie work like it should. One other nice thing I could say is that I enjoyed the score, which punctuated at all the right moments and was never overpowering. Generally speaking, I count this as an interesting misfire. It's definitely worth one watch, but no more.",The Counselor
64,FilmMan47,Ridley Scott's Most Weird Project Ever,4,22 February 2014,"i am a huge fan or Ridley Scott unlike his brother Tony Scott who directed only one good film in his life it was top gun everyone remembers but Ridley Scott keeps the camera clean and never messes up anything he is one of the best director in the world but here something went very wrong as Scott tried to ape Quentin Tarantino but failed he wanted to try something else then usual science fiction films or historical periodic drama genre that he is famous for the beginning of this script is quite underrated i have to say i mean the dialogs and story it could have been a perfect film if it wasn't for dumb moments and limited performances of such big actors to below average the result would not have been that bad.first of all i have to say one thing many moments in this film are not original they are inspired or ripped of directly that deadly neck lock was from saw series and the scene were the biker gets his head cut off & dies because of a wire on the road planted by a bad guy is taken from hit-man:enemy within a novel came in 2007 agent 47 does something exactly like this.the plot:a counselor gets dragged in between the war involving drug trafficking he soon finds out there is a dangerous enemy lurking everywhere and his is not safe.the cast:the most disappointing thing is this the biggest name in Hollywood gets wasted here with almost zero performance except Javier Bardem and brad Pitt these guys did some comedy,Michael Fassbender was nice as usual,Penelope Cruz god she was looking uninterested and Cameron Diaz appears as a villain she played her and she seems to be the only one enjoying every minute of it.this film was going great until it started to look like a direct to DVD film or a spoof on all Hollywood films the ending is pure hilarious the funniest scene was when someone puts a death neck collar on brad Pitt he starts to give hilarious expressions and dialogs it made me burst out laughing one can assume its a serious film but its not its looks more like a satire i mean this film tried to hard to make an impression it was getting extended for no reason.Overall The Counselor 2013 is one of those films the makers and even the cast will point it out as the biggest regret in there careers so if you are a fan of Javier Bardem & Brad Pitt then do watch this.My Rating Is 4/10.",The Counselor
65,dave-mcclain,"""The Counselor"" is a more character-driven story than your average drug trade film.",8,3 December 2015,"Drug trafficking has been the source of countless movies, even before ""Scarface"" Tony Montana invited his assassins to ""say hello to my little friend"". And it's easy to see why Hollywood has returned to this subject so many times since. Drug dealers represent a shadowy underworld full of danger. This sub-genre easily lends itself to great drama – almost too easily. While many of these movies might blend together in your memory with their similar plot lines and interchangeable characters, the 2013 entry into this crowded field stands out. ""The Counselor"" (R, 1:57), treats the drug trade as background. The film emphasizes its human drama, making its characters practically pop off the screen in vivid detail.The title role is played by Michael Fassbender. He's a lawyer who has worked with some pretty unsavory characters and has decided to participate in a Juarez to El Paso drug shipment that promises a very big payoff. He becomes engaged to his girlfriend Laura (Oscar winner Penelope Cruz) and seems to want to give her the best of everything. The Counselor is in league with men like Reiner (Oscar winner Javier Bardem) and Westray (multiple Oscar nominee Brad Pitt) who have seen it all and done it all. They offer advice on how to deal with the dangerous world he's entering, but they don't have a lot of answers when things go south and the local drug cartel thinks that The Counselor is trying to steal their shipment of cocaine. He learns that whenever you're in business with bad people, bad things can happen at any moment and even minor mistakes can be deadly. The mayhem feels simultaneously real and symbolic.This is a thinking person's drug movie. The plot develops slowly as we see various characters doing things and having conversations that seem unrelated or inconsequential, but the great cast and the very smart dialog keep you engaged and make you eager to see how all this will come together. When it does, you can feel the danger the characters are in and the remorse they have, both for poor choices and for misunderstandings that carry life-altering consequences. The outstanding acting (especially by Fassbender) and the film's superior score draw you in and then propel you through plot points that you may see coming, but still generate suspense. This movie makes us think – while putting together the puzzle, once all the pieces have finally been revealed, and in the film's life lessons, both implied by the plot and insightfully expressed by the characters. I think that ""The Counselor"" builds too slowly and doesn't explain some characters' actions clearly enough, but Cormac McCarthy's script is generally well-written and Ridley Scott's direction is excellent.

You have one of the best directors of all time, some wonderful global city settings, great actor ensemble and one of the most revered authors in the world. Yet it's a shamble.Just doesn't grab you at all. The acting is generally fine, but it tries to be such a slow-burn that you just lose interest. Never picks up. Very unforgiving film, with none of the characters able to be empathised with. They are all very immoral or at least amoral.The author also wrote No Country for Old Men, and this should have followed that sort of feel, but doesn't. The dialogue is often incomprehensible, and you just sit there counting down the minutes left.Cameron Diaz despite the years catching up under her eyeballs, plays the role as if she is some very cheapened 20 year old. It can get quite funny and uneasy. Yet her character is also one of the darker manipulators in this film, and does keep it going. I'd like to summarise the rest of the characters, but the rest aren't at all interesting. Javier Bardem in particular is surprisingly poor, or was it just his dialogue? It's just not worth going on anymore about this. It's best left ignored.A real disappointment.",The Counselor

And they're good here.I feel for these two guys. They make the film watchable.The problem with this film is that it really doesn't tell much of a story. The script is really spotty too. At times it's pitch perfect(like late when Fassbender is bartering for his wife - good stuff) - at other times it's teeth-grindingly painful(the first 30 min).The story is very simple, and the dialog sheds absolutely NO light on the details. We know what's going-on but there's no specifics about anything or anyone. We don't know anything about these characters. N-O-T-H-I-N-G. And it's a shame because these people can act, and these characters SEEM interesting.The ""numbers"" conversation between Pitt and Fassbender is the most vague and ridiculous drug-meandering mess of an explanation you'll ever see about anything. I'm a brewer. The equivalent would be me giving you a recipe that says, ""you take some malt, heat some water, put it on that malt, strain it, boil it, throw it in a bucket with some yeast, and bottle it, AND THAT'S EXACTLY HOW YOU MAKE THAT AMAZING BEER OF MINE"", and then expect somebody to draw something from it. Aside from frustration.The story reminds me of ""Traffic"", but the execution and look reminds me of ""Miami Vice"", and sometimes in an even-worse way.It's not terrible - unless you consider it's directed by Ridley Scott and stars two of the finest screen actors in the world. Then yeah.. it's not-so-good.51/100 You !MIGHT! like this if you liked:Savages(about even), Alpha Dog(even), Runner Runner(ever-so-slightly better), Miami Vice(even - wew), and No Country For Old Men(in a different ballpark).probably sitting around 57/83 for 2013.",The Counselor

However, if you go into this expecting another No Country, your in for a rude awakening. It doesn't have anywhere near the intensity or grit, and is just muddled and incohesive. As for the philosophical depth to the story...well it certainly has that. As a matter of fact too much. The Counselor takes thinking to a whole new and too high level and McCarthy's attempts to impart his metaphysical reasoning simply becomes comical.The movie has cast chalk with A-listers, but Bardem's role isn't up to his capabilities and for everyone of the few minutes Brad Pitt is on screen he just makes you wish he was the lead instead of Fassenbender.And as for Ridley Scott, let me just leave it at The Counselor isn't quite a failure inspite of him.",The Counselor

And, the flashback where CD masturbates on a a Ferrari's windshield.Aside from those, I was bored stiff.I mean, what was supposed to be the moral of this story? That crime doesn't pay for those who merely dabble in it, thinking their hands will only get half-dirty? That serial killers can also be organized crime bosses?

There are entire stories started, and left out in the sun to die. There is one true evil in the movie, and it is so much worse than what you would expect. You will be taken deep into the underbelly of the Cartels, but you really never see the darkest sides. You see actions, and results, but there are a lot of missing pieces. This movie seems to have held back from what it was supposed to be, and that is a shame. I did Enjoy this film in the way that The Mexican was enjoyable, but unlike that movie this is not funny, and there is no true lesson learned, just a lot of fear, and reasons to be afraid.

The writing and the acting were great, even if the plot was flawed.",The Counselor
72,billygoat1071,Just Tag Along,7,17 November 2013,"There is one very important rule of seeing The Counselor, always remember that its screenplay writer is Cormac McCarthy. And the thing about this writer is it's the words that bring pizazz to his stories. People may jump in to the film expecting more of the horrifying consequences that the characters will get, but most of it are just scenes of discussions mainly about moral dilemmas and their other interests. It's a somewhat strange film, but it's also thoroughly fascinating, only when you have the right idea what experience you're going to get.The film already falters by lacking any sort of momentum and having a pretty obvious message, even at the very start. There isn't really much going on with the lead characters at the first half other than conversations, but then it's not about them doing anything. Their fate actually depends on what's happening behind their business, where cartels have to feud for the shipment. As a result the danger happens like a snap, where they probably didn't see coming. Surprisingly there is hardly any tension created within those scenes, it just describes whatever effect it will cause when you get to involve in a dirty work.Again, it's all about McCarthy's words. Paying close attention to his dialogue is really the best advice here, just tag along with the subjects he wants to talk about so you may leave yourself interested throughout the plot. Some parts of the script can be too laughably silly, but there are also plenty of fascinating things to think about. And for its surfaces, there are plenty of obvious McGuffins to notice. Obsession with diamonds, cheetah obsessed antagonists (basically because they're predators), sex, and violent consequences. In spite of all of that, it still doesn't built any subtlety, but it's probably an addition for personality.The filmmaking works well enough. Ridley Scott's direction is predictably stylish, and it decently blends with its gritty violence. The grainy camera quality fits perfectly to its tone. And for the acting, it's not a nuance for Michael Fassbender, but he handles the character well and he is, as always, charming. Javier Bardem and Brad Pitt share the same feat with Fassbender. The least impressive among is Cameron Diaz who occasionally hams it up, but that seems what you'll get if you have an intensely ruthless villain.Conventional viewers will find it hard to consider The Counselor as entertaining, but it is quite reasonable. It's not meant to be exciting, nor subtle. There is no nuance to be found either. Despite of being almost uncinematic, it's still ridiculously gripping and provocative. Yes, whatever McCarthy is trying to tell us is too crystal clear, but it's all spiced up. In the end, that's it. Just follow whatever the writer wants to say on screen. Anything else are portraits of their ugly, cruel world and it brings more effect to the story. The Counselor can be a troubling experiment, but it seems to work as it wanted to be.",The Counselor
73,rubenm,"Some fine moments, but unbalanced",6,30 November 2013,"A woman having sex with a car. A guy shaking a decapitated head out of a motorcycle helmet. A man getting killed by an automatic strangling device. All this and more in 'The Counselor', an over-the-top movie about a lawyer getting involved in a shady drugs deal that inevitably goes terribly wrong. Apart from these extreme scenes, the cast is the main attraction of the movie. Top notch Hollywood stars like Brad Pitt, Javier Bardem and Cameron Diaz are playing weird characters. They are all living in a world full of beautiful people, driving expensive cars and living in design interiors. Add to this some dialogues full of absurd wisecracks like 'The truth has no temperature', and you get a film that could be great. With these ingredients, 'The Counselor' could have been an ultra cool film, something like a crossing between Tarantino and the Coen Brothers. But somehow, it all doesn't add up. For one thing, the plot is never completely clear. I tried to connect the dots, but I didn't succeed. This is not in all cases a problem. In a film like 'Syriana' the plot was also hazy, but this didn't bother me. As long as you go along with the general mood of a film, it's not a problem when some elements are not spelled out. But in this case, too much is left unexplained. And then there is the dialogue. There is a lot of it. Some of it is witty and sharp. Unfortunately, there are also lengthy monologues full of heavy philosophical thoughts, which are completely unbelievable and not helping the film in any way. Writer Cormac McCarthy failed in this respect. This film has some fine moments, but it is unbalanced and doesn't reach its full potential.",The Counselor

The reason for that is, of course, Cormac McCarthy. This time the producers, obviously satisfied with the success of two aforementioned movies, gave him the opportunity to write his own movie. Despite all drawbacks, The Councellor makes most sense of all three.It is my impression that the pivot of Cormac McCarthy's work are images on which he builds his stories. This i say without reading the books, merely after watching movies based on them. In The Councellor this has been driven to the extreme.The movie is built written as a series of scenes that happen a specific location and involve a couple of characters. There was almost no connection between them and they are so slow paced that i started wondering what the point was.The cast was fine, except Cameron Diaz, whose looks couldn't compensate the sub-par performance.",The Counselor
75,TheSquiss,"A cold, niche film. Prometheus for the crime genre.",6,25 November 2013,"Ridley Scott has become something of a misunderstood director recently (see the mixed reaction to Prometheus). Audiences seem to keep expecting action adventures (more the style of his bother, the late Tony Scott) instead of the moody, cerebral take on life and fantasy that Ridley so often produces. For every Black Hawk Down, he's given us an Alien, for every Gladiator a Blade Runner...The lukewarm reaction to The Counsellor, judging from the rumblings I've heard, come down largely to this repeated misconception. Scott's latest offering is a good film with a great cast but it's going to bore you senseless if you're seeking car chases and gunfire.The Counsellor (or The Councilor for US audiences) is cold. It's harsh and at times sickening. It's rarely fun, it saunters rather than sprints and there aren't many characters in it that you'll find yourself rooting for. But, trust me, that's a good thing here. My full appreciation for The Counsellor grew on the journey home when I'd had time to mull it over. It's a film that sinks in slowly and the horror of the protagonist's predicament chills thoroughly with time and will repel many audiences from the outset. But for those familiar with, and appreciative of, the work and style of Cormack McCarthy, his first original screenplay may prove to be a memorable and rewarding experience.The Counsellor in question (played by Michael Fassbender) sees the opportunity to make a serious wad of cash through drug trafficking with Reiner (Javier Bardem with distinctive hair). Sickeningly happy with his fiancée, Laura (Penélope Cruz), life is good until he meets up with middleman Westray (Brad Pitt), who tells him the deal is going south and happiness may be in short supply very soon. Throw into the mix a snake in female form, Malkina (Cameron Diaz), and you have a nasty business indeed.The Counsellor unveils the hopelessness and futility of morality within the crime world. It's a harsh existence and, though there's little point in feeling sorry for him for his foolish but conscious choice, it's difficult not to pity the counsellor when his world falls irrevocably apart.The warmth, such as it is, comes from the performances. It's an absolute pleasure to watch so many actors at the top of their game. The action is largely in the dialogue and the reactions rather than though stunts and scenarios upon the screen, though there are sufficient of those to punctuate the conversation.As for memorable moments, both Brad Pitt's final scene and Cameron Diaz's antics with a certain car will remain with the viewer almost as vividly in the aftermath as they occurred on the screen.But occasionally The Counsellor is a dull film and those dull moments blunt the intensity of the dialogue and the underlying sinister tones. In the hands of, say, Paul Greengrass, this would have been a crowd-pleasing thriller, just as Aliens satisfied the gung-ho masses. As it is, Scott delivers a Prometheus for the crime genre that will disappoint many and but fit beautifully into a niche.For more reviews from The Squiss, subscribe to my blog and like the Facebook page.",The Counselor

Unfortunately, the movie just felt like it wasn't trying or it put in the effort that it felt was ""good enough."" That might explain why Cameron Diaz was cast but it doesn't excuse how weak the plot was and, more importantly, how weakly the film's conflict is setup.I get it, ""The Counselor"" wants to be a Tarantino film but it lacks the Tarantino magic.

80,pfgpowell-1,Has its flaws but a lot better than you might have been led to expect,8,16 November 2014,"Don't be put off by the low overall rating The Counsellor gets here on IMDb, it's better than that. The film most certainly has its faults, but for a certain kind of film-goer who likes a certain kind of film it really hits the button and then some. I think the problem it has - and the reason so many critics, both IMDb users and professional film critics, have not rated it highly - is that they expected one kind of film and were presented with quite another.That other film, the one they weren't expecting to see, is not just rather but, in my view, very good. But try to explain a 12-year-old who expects a feast of candy that caviar, capers, garlic, wine, or a very dry vermouth can be even nicer. You're wasting your time. My rather far-fetched analogy might seem a little off-the-wall, but it does neatly describe what's going on here (even though I say so myself).Had The Counsellor been made by a Frenchman or an Italian or a German and had it been marketed as an 'art-house film', the critics, I'm sure, would have been more than a little impressed. As it was they were expecting your standard drug deal goes wrong film, didn't actually get, and metaphorically stamped their feet in outraged protest. So if you are reading this before you've seen it and are reading reviews to help you to decide whether to bother, bear that in mind.Ridley Scott's The Counsellor with a script by Cormac McCarthy - now that should have given away that there would be rather more to it all than meets the eye - is most certainly not without its faults. For one thing it does have its longueurs which are, if not exactly tedious, are a little too wordy even for an art-house film. Furthermore, a lot of what is said in those in those scenes - by the Sephardic Jewish diamond dealer in Amsterdam, by the rather greasy partner in crime, and by the surprisingly philosophical (and apparently very refined) Mexican drug gang boss was - for this viewer at least - verging on nonsense: it sounded right and gave the impression of profundity, but in the event - well, it was pretty much nonsense.Those rather wordy scenes - it is no coincidence that the French word 'longueur' is closely related to the English 'long' will undoubtedly have tested the patience of many a film-goer hoping for, and being denied, the clichéd drug deal gone wrong schtick.I have no idea what the writer Cormac McCarthy would claim his is story is about, but for me it simply portrayed pure unadulterated evil, as personified by Cameron Diaz's character. OK, she gets away with $20 million, but you sense that the financial reward is purely incidental. Diaz's Malkinka is a highly, highly disturbed woman who sets out to corrupt whoever she can, remarkably, it seems, simply because she might be able to: from Fassbender's fiancée Penelope Cruz, to her rather useless would-be playboy club owner boyfriend Javier Bardem to - most obviously just at random - a Roman Catholic priest who is eventually forced to flee the confessional which she has decided to visit. Diaz plays a blinder.Brad Pitt (whose films I like very much and whose ill-advised involvement in Tarantino's unbelievably bad and hamfisted Inglorious Basterds will forever baffle me) is another of her victims, a man who has the wisest head of all the greedy bunch hoping to make a fortune from the drug deal and apparently seems to know when to get out ironically still loses his head.There were the days when Hollywood would only settle for a happy ending and that good always had to triumph as the curtain came down on the last scene (its ludicrous and dishonesty in that respect even insisting that the villain in is version of Jamaica Inn could not be a clergyman - a man of God - and so rewrote du Maurier's story to the local squire became the wrong 'un).Well, those days are now well and truly gone: evil wins out in Scott's The Counsellor and Diaz gives the distinct impression that her character will carry on being successfully evil for quite some time to come. The Counsellor is a lot better than you might have been led to believe. Just don't expect your usual schtick and you will not be disappointed. Yes, The Counsellor has its faults, but the film's virtues more than make up for them. That's why I have given it an 8/10",The Counselor
81,daniel-mannouch,Ain't it Chief,2,24 February 2020,"The Counselor is infamous for it's pretentiousness and the immense critical failure it was, given the talent that had been assembled for the production. And sure as hell, it did not disappoint.This has genuine value as a learning tool for screenwriting classes as it's the absolute antithesis of show, don't tell and is a prime example of why that mantra is true now as it's ever been. The Counsellor is eighty percent subtext and twenty percent text. The length of some of these dialogue exchanges is near surreal. I've seen many a direct to video film with similar examples of talking heads outstaying their welcome, but that was because they had no money.The talent that be-gifted this production meant one thing, $25 million estimate, which of course was made back despite everything, so there was no excuse for near two hours of a two hour, seventeen minute running time (yes i did watch the extended version), to be taken up by arse gazing rhetorical speech. You could blame a lot of people, but let's blame screenwriter Cormac Mcarthy as that's the right answer. I never seen a screenwriter given so much leeway on a production this scale in the modern era and screw it up so badly.Many of the film's faults begin and end with the script as the dialogue occupies the majority of the running time and scenes that resemble something akin to visual storytelling are only there to move the threadbare plot forward or to add emphasis to the inane crap that spewing out of these character's mouths.And yet,something in the back of my mind is telling me I should give credit to a film that is so brazen with it's ambition. But, the dialogue is indeed that insufferable, the plot that thin and the misogyny all that present amongst all the grand speeches regarding determinism, like a fart in a gold plated elevator, that i feel no guilt in describing The Counsellor as an colossal failure and a utter waste of cinematic talent. It's almost so bad it's good, but it's just too sure of itself to retain that kind of charm.",The Counselor
82,rooee,Mistranslated,6,17 November 2013,"There have been some notable films recently about the state of Western capitalism following the crash of 2007, including Andrew Dominik's bleak and humorous Killing Them Softly, which also features Brad Pitt's splendid hair. If you thought that film was heavy-handed, just wait 'til you get a load of this equally bleak but not so humorous Cormac McCarthy-scripted thriller.It was nice of Ridley Scott to offer us the British spelling of ""counsellor"" in the credits, but we could have done with a better film off the back of it. The plot is a simple story of an essentially decent man (the titular counsellor; a reliably solid performance from Michael Fassbender) drawn by greed into a deal with the devil. The devil in this case is a Mexican drugs cartel. After endless cautionary soliloquies, things go awry, and suddenly everyone associated with the counsellor is being violently picked off. Then the soliloquies turn to the nature of grief.On the page, McCarthy is a rambling storyteller, and it works in a kind of bitter-old-man-beside-a-campfire kind of way. His style translates to the page when it is drawn visually (No Country for Old Men and, to a lesser extent, The Road), but for his first screenplay it's like he's chosen a book reading. The result is dialogue – and this is a film driven by dialogue – which ranges from the ripe to the risible.As a painter of the modern soul, McCarthy proves that it's possible to be romantic in tone without being hopeful in outlook. As the malevolent Malkina (Cameron Diaz) reflects, there is elegance in the narrative she oversees – but that doesn't mean that the good guys will necessarily win. The brutal reality of the capitalist system is that it is set up to ensure the failure of those who would do what is right, or even those who would take pause before doing what is obviously wrong.As the drugs are passed from lorry to chemical-cleaned lorry toward the crystal-glassed tablecloths of the elite, we're left in no doubt that this is a film about the money laundered to the top of our society today, and the distance of those who enjoy it from its ugly source. This is a powerful and relevant metaphor, but what's wrong with it remaining a metaphor? Why spoil it with unconvincing monologues which reduce every character to a nameless narrator? With a cast like this, the performances are just about enough to carry it through. I particularly admire what Penelope Cruz makes of a fairly thankless role, while Cameron Diaz is unforgettable... for a variety of reasons. Brad Pitt shows up carrying the same steely serenity as Jon Voight's Nate from Heat, while Javier Bardem shows up carrying another memorable hairdo – but neither has a chance to get to the bottom of their character while speaking dialogue this overcooked.In concept and cast, and in the odd individual scene, this isn't a bad film. But it goes to show that while the meeting of talented minds might on paper look sure-fire, the result sometimes just doesn't hang together as a whole.",The Counselor
83,markgorman,A flawed gem. But well worth seeing,7,19 November 2013,"The Counsellor opens with Michael Fassbender underneath the sheets with Penelope Cruz having a little, erm shall we say, protein supplement? Anyway, she's lapping it up (strictly speaking though, he is.).So far, what's there not to like? Cruz looks ravishing as she approaches 40. My wife tells me Fassbender always looks ravishing.It's a gentle opening to a movie that at times is anything but.It's been deeply criticised in many reviews I've read for the quality of the stellar cast's acting and commitment (Cruz, Bardem, Pitt, Fassbender and Diaz) but I enjoyed each and every performance.It's also been deeply criticised for the script. Now that, to a point, I can hold sway with.As the world's greatest living fiction writer, frustrated by his screen adaptations (No Country for Old Men and The Road), Cormac McCarthy felt it was time to put pen to screenplay paper for the first time.In many ways he shouldn't have because whole scenes are impenetrable guff. And the plot is nothing short of labyrinthine.And yet. It works.It's a languid, stunningly shot (Dariusz Wolski Prometheus/Sweeney Todd) modern day mafia movie/Western set in El Paso,Texas and at times in Mexico.The film's plot centres on Fassbender (The Counsellor) who gets himself embroiled in a drug deal that essentially goes wrong. It gets messy but that's not really, for me, the soul of the film.The soul of it is about female power; their power over men, both sexually and emotionally, and that's what actually makes it both a superior movie but also leads to some of McCarthy's excesses. They might have worked in a novel but appear clunky on screen in places.Diaz and Cruz present opposite ends of the female control spectrum (Cruz womanly and traditional, Diaz a ball breaker). It's interesting casting because Cruz smoulders in her advancing years and plays the ""girl next door""; Diaz, by contrasts, often looks a bit blokey (yes - come on, she's always been one of the boys - There's Something about Mary)She's ageing (sorry to be so frank but she looks more than her two score years and one in this) but that kinds of adds to her menace. For pets she keeps cheetahs. Cheetahs that hunt Jack Rabbits on the Texan plains. She likes the kills.The scene by the pool in which Diaz grills Cruz oh her taste in men clearly positions Diaz as the Alpha female and so the movie goes on to prove.There's lots of A list men in this movie but Diaz is the power broker.In conclusion. Don't believe all the negative reviews. This is a flawed gem that has much to recommend it.7.5/10",The Counselor

85,The_late_Buddy_Ryan,Chicks and Ducks and Geese Better Scurry,5,12 July 2014,"Short of reading the published screenplay by cult novelist Cormac McCarthy (which one critic actually suggested), the only way of figuring out the plot of this one may be to get the Blu-ray with the ""unrated extended cut,"" which has an extra 20 minutes of sex, violence and, hopefully, much-needed exposition. The version we saw on cable was just about incomprehensible. There's a septic-tank pumper truck full of barrels of coke (I think) headed from Ciudad Juárez to Chicago; hit squads dressed as cops and creepy assassins ply their trade; the truck gets hijacked, then hijacked back, and somehow the nebbishy title character is on the hook to the CJ cartel for the whole twenty mil. The mechanics of constructing a coherent narrative seem to be of little interest to McCarthy. Unfortunately what does seem to be of interest are the long, tedious monologues on the meaninglessness of life (and related themes) that he assigns, seemingly at random, to the less-purposeful characters played by the big-name cast members, who do little to advance the plot but get most of the screen time. Of these, Cameron Diaz, as the polymorphous bitch goddess with the brace of cheetahs and the caked-up eye makeup, is by far the most annoying. Ridley Scott does a fine job with the brief action sequences, for what that's worth. Great cast (have Bruno Ganz and Rosie Perez ever been in a movie together?), great cinematography; I found out about a great poem by Machado (""Caminante, son tus huellas el camino..."") that's quoted, untranslated of course, in one of the narcos' long, pointless monologues, so I can't say the experience was a total loss",The Counselor
86,doug_park2001,"""Greed really takes you to the edge, doesn't it?""",8,14 March 2014,"Whew! I wasn't ready for this.WARNING: Many people will casually pick up and watch this film, noticing the prominent cast and hoping for just another good legal thriller that more or less follows the formula. Those people are in for a big unpleasant surprise. THE COUNSELOR will NOT warm the heart when justice is served in the end. Though gory and violent, it goes no farther in those areas than lots of other films do: It's the story itself that is so bleak and disturbing. Another thing: Depending upon interpretation, certain aspects may seem misogynistic and prove particularly alienating to many women.Though a true literary genius, novelist Cormac McCarthy is not known for his cheery optimism. In this venture into film writing, he reaches new depths of pessimism that sometimes border on the darkest nihilism. Nevertheless, there are obvious basic morals to be drawn from THE COUNSELOR.McCarthy spits in the face of so many storytelling conventions here, creating a tale that's seldom told but is so often true. It's all about the young and recently engaged ""Counselor,"" played by Michael Fassbender, who finds himself succumbing to a shady deal with a more-than-shady crowd. The plot flies in many directions, and the sheer number of characters can be a little overwhelming. It's hard to place where everyone fits in and the game each person is playing. The transitions are abrupt, which seems intentional for some reason even though it doesn't exactly work. In that respect, the storyline is indeed flawed, which is why I give this film eight stars instead of ten. It's essentially a video novel, not simply a film adaptation of a book, something that could hasten the development of a whole new subgenre of filming. Still, let's not forget that the first novels were badly plotted, the first suspense films quite unsuspenseful, the first poems badly rhymed, etc. This early effort in ""video novelization"" or whatever we choose to call it employs techniques that work all the time on paper but are harder to utilize on screen. The character development in particular just isn't quite there.Regardless, THE COUNSELOR is expertly filmed, well-acted, and compelling. Cameron Diaz especially stands out as Malkina, a character who's hard to forget no matter how much we may want to forget her. The larger-than-life dialogue is arresting in itself. This sort of script is hard to make work. Many films have tried it, but most have failed, and very few have succeeded this brilliantly. The early exchanges of dialogue between all the major sets of characters are important in foreshadowing and allowing the audience some clue of what's going on here and what might ultimately happen. I know that I missed a lot on first view but am eager to watch this again. . .and again.",The Counselor

Diaz, Pitt and Cruz just seem uncomfortable speaking this gibberish and their performances are poor, and it's topped off with Diaz giving us a humiliating performance and scene where she humps a filthy car windshield. Sure, she's game, but she and most of this cast seem like vacuous Hollywood airheads who trusted this unbelievably bad script and went all out.

89,Ryan_MYeah,Another blunder for Ridley Scott.,3,11 September 2014,"I admire Ridley Scott as much as the next guy. He's great with actors and he's a great visual artist, but if there's one vice he suffers from, it's this. Scott has a penchant for picking bad scripts to film. He's *always* been wildly inconsistent with that, not merely in his last ten years, and in plenty of non-negligible cases, has had to go so far as to use his direction to mask the flaws of the writing. This was especially the case for films like Hannibal, 1492, Legend, A Good Year, and the notorious plot holes of Prometheus. I respect him for always trying to stretch his versatility, but his scripts don't do his strengths justice, and his last decade alone has been even patchier than Tim Burton's. The reason I say that is because The Counselor is yet another example of this. I know Cormac McCarthy is a great author (in fact, he wrote my favorite book, No Country for Old Men), but what makes him great in literature doesn't make him so in cinema. His script feels like it was originally meant for a book but trimmed for the screen, and it shows. The film expects us to immediately accept the reality of the situation, shorting us on crucial details behind the relationships of characters, something that even the awkward exposition can't fix. These characters are so middlingly established that I simply can't care about them. Another indication that it was meant for the page is that the script is incredibly busy and needlessly convoluted. It feels like several different movies are going on at once with nothing tying them together, and full of elements that go absolutely nowhere. As a book, this could be easily expanded upon and you could get away with this kind of busy structure, but in film, it's talky, dull, and loaded with redundancy (We get it, Cormac, actions have consequences). That even extends into the visuals with repeated imagery of cheetahs, no doubt to foreshadow the hungry predators about to descend upon the unwary prey of main characters... SYMBOLISM!Ridley Scott is trying his best to wrangle it all together, but no matter how hard he tries, he just can't generate any suspense from this film, and one of the only good scenes is setting up the wire on the road, because it's one of the few moments with no unneeded dialogue. There's too few of those tense moments present in the film, and despite the best efforts of the cast members, great actors can only elevate bad material so much (none dumber and more horrendous than Cameron Diaz screwing a car), and it makes for yet another blunder for Scott.",The Counselor

There are a few good jokes, a few interesting stories and scenes, some interesting thoughts to ponder on.But, all-in-all, it's bad.Mostly, the story makes little sense in a lot of places. So, the ""all-powerful"" cartel doesn't figure out it's Malkina (Cameron Diaz)? They catch the Wirecutter, they can figure out who hired him. Sure, they wanted to interrogate Javier Bardem to figure that out, but, once they killed him instead, the next obvious step was to take her (or maybe somebody else from his crew first, then they would learn from those guys that they need to take her). The whole point of her is that she's ""wild in the open"", so, people know her, thus cartel knows her.Even worse, she figures out where's Brad Pitt. He's a smart and experienced guy, who has planned his escape for years. Cartel can't catch him. But Cameron Diaz can?! They might have some history, but, that's enough to know of his weakness for blondes, but, not for his escape route. Not to mention that it's highly unlikely that the blonde girl would get the password for his accounts. Even the username is highly unlikely (remember, he's an experience and smart guy). Also, e-banking doesn't really work (just) like this, you need some smart-card or token generator or some such thing.Since the conclusion is w/Malkina, that leaves a very bad impression of the movie. Especially since at the very end she informs us of the coming Doom - yeah, we know, world is coming to and end, it' has been for thousands of years, it surely isn't up to the likes of old dirty blondes to figure that out and lay the wisdom on to us. Had it ended w/Counsellor receiving the (impliedly) snafu of his fiancé, that would have been much better (I would thrown out the Malkina endgame altogether, but, even leaving it but trading places/order would be better).Also, Cameron Diaz, while looking _very_ good for her age, is obviously past her prime and, even for an older guy like Javier Bardem, is not a likely girl to ""blow his mind"", I don't care how many car windshields she does nasty things to.Also, everybody's a philosopher, which also doesn't make much sense. Sure, Javier Bardem does, but the rest of them, no, not really.Acting is decent, but, nothing remarkable.

92,trublu215,This really could have been something...,5,13 February 2014,"The Counselor is a film that trades in coherent storytelling for metaphoric dialog that ultimately amounts to nothing special. While having metaphoric dialog is not a bad thing, having the most direct line in the film be ""these guys are the cartel"" is. The Counselor will have you rewinding every ten minutes just to understand it, which is rather frustrating considering there is a really great film underneath the glossy dialog and Cameron Diaz. Unfortunately for us, this great film that I believe exists never sees the light of day. Instead, the film transitions from one scene to the next without giving rhyme or reason as to what the characters are doing. We, as the audience, are left befuddled by the end of it's 2 hour running time, walking away with a film to decipher instead of a film we could enjoy. Now, there is nothing wrong with a film that makes you think but in a film such as this, thinking is what we should be doing WHILE the film is progressing. And this film is about as progressive as the Great Recession of 2008. The players here turn in great performances, Fassbender is thoroughly watchable while Bardem gives a careful performance as a simple middleman hoping for a score. The rest of the cast falls into normalcy, Cruz gives a good performance but her character is extremely undercooked. Diaz is a weak link in a film filled with Oscar winners and nominees, despite looking seductive, her performance is greatly overshadowed by a really poor accent that goes from being Argentinian to sounding like an American desperately trying hard at a Spanish accent. In any regards, it is complete trash. Brad Pitt portrays Westrey, a sneaky and conniving businessman, very well and turns in a good performance but it never really stands out as great. While there is a lot wrong with this film, there are a couple truly unnerving scenes that keep the film from being a complete bore. A sequence involving a car chase towards the end is specifically intense but never capitalizes on the suspense it spent two minutes building. Instead it ends rather abrupt without any payoff.Ridley Scott directs his actors and the scenes well, but what this film suffers with is proper transitions into scenes and cryptic dialog that gets entirely too ridiculous by the end of it all. This is more of a rental than anything if you're a fan if Cormac McCarthy, but this is a film trying to be far too intelligent for it's own good and instead comes off cheap and wasteful.",The Counselor

Admittedly, aside from the fact that this is not a very cinematic endeavor, the first half of this film is pretty bad. That is to say the first act and a half is far too cryptic for its own good, with dialogue that is in love with its own double entendres and lines which sound as though they would be more at home in a novel than spoken aloud by human beings. But, if you're patient enough to stay with this film until the second hour, you will be rewarded by witnessing how McCarthy and Scott weave this almost action-less tale together, quietly guiding audiences into a brilliantly disturbing and hypnotic finale. The performances (the standout coming from Bardem) are all fine here. These are all great actors, so what else would you expect? Same goes for the direction. The wildcard with ""The Counselor"" was always McCarthy's transition from novel to feature film scriptwriting; a transition that was a first act failure on the grounds of dialogue alone. In that same breath, his high caliber story of a lawyer who gets involved in drug trafficking and his masterful construction redeems him almost entirely by the time it's all said and done. As I alluded to before, there is not much action here, which may give the illusion to some that sequences are occurring but nothing is progressing, which may also promote watch checking. But within this conversation based film, as much as I would have preferred the dialogue to have been handled with more subtlety, the subtext is always interesting, gaining its momentum from the converging stories within the second half. Final Thought: ""The Counselor"" is the film equivalent of an artichoke. You either like it or you don't. And both are understandable. Maybe one day, once all of the critical heat dies down, history will look more kindly on this movie. But for now, there will be flaws within it that a majority of mainstream audiences just won't be able to forgive. Written by Markus Robinson, Edited by Nicole I. Ashland",The Counselor
96,nesfilmreviews,The style doesn't mesh with its content.,4,26 October 2013,"""The Counselor"" is a flamboyant exhibition of attitude and style coupled with sociopathic behavior, and it becomes readily apparent that its style doesn't mesh with its content. Despite being ultra-violent and bleak, the movie's dialogue is brimming with long-winded philosophical conversations that will alienate as many viewers as it pleases. ""The Counselor"" suggests that humanity at large is too self-centered and broken to overcome the solitude of our existence, while it simply throws up obvious signposts of symbolism for what lies ahead. Working as a screenwriter for the first time after years of seeing his novels successfully adapted to the big-screen --""No Country for Old Men"" (2007) and ""The Road"" (2009) -- Cormac McCarthy is stretching his powers of language, his razor-thin storyline, and the cast of characters way too far.Set along the Texas/Mexico border, the counselor (Michael Fassbender) is an El Paso lawyer who decides to finance a major drug deal through one of his clients, nightclub owner Reiner (Javier Bardem). There is no back story for the counselor, except that he's in love with a sexy woman named Laura (Penélope Cruz), and he has undefined money troubles. It's the usual routine for a lifelong law-abiding lawyer gone bad: one major drug heist and I'm out. His clients who are now turned partners, Reiner and Westray (Brad Pitt), orchestrate the cartel delivery from Mexico to Chicago. They also make clear to the counselor that Mexican drug cartels don't mess around, in case anyone wasn't aware. Naturally, the deal goes bad due to a coincidence, and the counselor scrambles to make things right, only to face the severity of his one bad decision. The movie quickly identifies the person pulling all the strings, Reiner's scheming, cheetah-obsessed mistress Malkina (Cameron Diaz). There's nothing left to do now but wade through the numerous decapitations, shootings, and sexual perversity.The movie revels in painting the bizarre, outlandish behavior of its wide-ranging cast of characters. There are an endless array of enigmatic conversations along with the constant inclusion of supporting characters and distracting cameos that are never fleshed out to satisfaction. The bulk of the film consists of wordy meetings where characters interact using dense philosophical dialogue about the nature of their actions and greed, crimes and punishment, all while suggesting that the counselor will be the one to eventually take the fall. A major issue with the movie is that the thin plot is obviously predetermined, and there is little point in seeing it through to the end. Both the counselor and his girlfriend are so bleakly fated from frame one they might as well have ""victims"" tattooed on their forehead.Director Ridley Scott seems so infatuated with the script written by McCarthy that the pace of this sketchy story is in complete shambles. Cormac McCarthy suffers in his first cinema-born effort of trying to insist on his themes too insistently through only the dialogue. Here, characters deliver lines like ""The truth has no temperature"" and ""grief transcends value"" -- and when spoken by people, the words ring hollow and overly theatrical. ""The Counselor"" must have looked great on paper, but it doesn't translate well on the big screen. Except for an unforgettable scene with Cameron Diaz who gets off on the windshield of Reiner's convertible, we can only wonder what could have been.",The Counselor

The film has an star-studded cast and a screenwriter with a big reputation as a novelist, but the end result doesn't add up to anything more than a routine suspense thriller masquerading as a cautionary tale.As far as plot is concerned, the corrupt attorney soon gets out of his depth among the drug smugglers, hit-men, wicked women and a couple of cheetahs, but Scott provides little reason to care about the fate of his characters. Whatever sympathy one might have considered wasting on such generic types soon disappears when they start making pompous speeches to one another in between the shoot-outs, betrayals, kidnappings and assassinations.

Ever since it came out I was intrigued how it got very mixed reviews when it had such an amazing cast and crew. But now I know. I'll start with the positives because there actually is plenty to like in this movie. The acting first and foremost is phenomenal, particularly Fassbender and Bardem. It's the only reason you care about anything that's happening. The directing is slick and stylish, and there are a few scenes that are actually brilliant to see unfold. Some lines of dialogue are powerful. Cameron Diaz was good. I'm already running out of positive things to say so let's get right into it.This movie is a hot mess. There are a hundred characters in this damn thing, it's over 2 hours long when it shouldn't have been, every scene could've been cut in half and the movie would've been all the better for it. It's hard to keep up with all the crap going on because it's so scatterbrained in its storytelling. And that's weird to say because Bardem's character tells some really captivating and hilarious stories. But the movie itself is so wordy and self-indulgent that even if you want to keep up with everything that's happening, there's no good reason to. It's an exercise in tedium after a while. It's like the writer said, ""Let's see how many words I can squeeze into this scene before the audience has no idea what the f*ck it's about,"" and he did that for every damn scene. And again, there are glimmers of brilliance, hell the actual story is really interesting, but goddamn that just makes it all the more frustrating.The plot can be boiled down to a lawyer getting himself in a bad situation with drug guys and how he tries to get out of it. It sounds like a focused plot, but the movie complicates it beyond comprehension. One minute I'm totally entranced by what's happening on screen, anxiously awaiting what's going to happen next, and then the movie will jump to a scene with random characters we've never seen before talking about nonsense, and they just keep talking and talking until I forget what I was entranced with in the first place. Seriously, if every scene in the movie was cut in half, it could be an excellent crime thriller. There are some truly brutal moments in the movie, and some thought-provoking ones, but they get stretched out and morphed to the point of bewilderment. Some of the lines in this movie are cringe-worthy. Like, did they really have to repeat what the other person said in five different ways? No? That's what I thought. And that's why this movie pisses me off.The Counselor will definitely impress some people. If you can handle an absolute clusterf*ck of a movie with a few amazing scenes and superb acting then you'll probably enjoy it. But even that makes it sound better than it is, because the great scenes are so few and far between you're left thinking, ""Why on earth did they go in this direction? They had something great here!"" It's a baffling movie, really, and the more I think about it the more it upsets me because of how great it could've been. Its potential was so clear, it's like they tried to make it as convoluted and stupid as possible.Worst of all, the movie takes itself dead seriously. It thinks it's so great, and again for the millionth time, IT COULD'VE BEEN. But no, The Counselor refuses to take other people into consideration. It's so in love with itself it gives no one else a reason to love it, let alone care. Watch at your own risk.",The Counselor
102,lucasnochez,Review: The Counselor Night Film Reviews www.nightfilmreviews.com,1,11 November 2013,"In 2007, Michael Bay created a mega, summer movie blockbuster event that brought some incredible advances in special effects, a slew of unnecessary sequels and most importantly, made famous the incredibly sexy, sweaty grease-monkey character Mikaela Banes, also knows as Megan Fox. If there is anything Michael Bay did right in that film, was give audience members as well as pop-culture enthusiasts one of the most memorable cinematic stills since Marilyn Monroe in 1954′s The Seven Year Itch. Leaning on the sizzling hood of Sam Witwicky's 1976 Chevrolet Camaro's hood, allowing the heat from the engine to soak Mikaela's body with sweet sweat, Bay created eternal movie magic with that iconic scene. Since then, audiences, as well as critics alike, never thought that the day would come when an overly fetishized, sexual image involving a car would ever come. Oh, it came!The only difference between Diaz's Malkina's outrageous car scene and Fox's iconic heated scene is that, Diaz and company wish they had as good a movie as Transformers on their hands and a film that people will actually care to watch and recommend, and that's putting it nicely.The Counselor seemed to have no advising or counseling on it at all, because director Ridley Scott and company deliver what is surely going to be one of the worst decisions in their careers in a long time. What looked like a thrilling game of cat and mouse, quickly becomes a dry, careless piece of gorgeous snuff.The Counselor follows, well, the counselor (Michael Fassbender) as he navigates the waters of his first ever, illegal and immoral business venture of drug trafficking from Mexico across the United States boarder. That is pretty well everything you need to know and everything that is really told. Just like the lack to give a name to the lead, The Counselor is a cold, informal and perplexing film of too many characters and not enough explanation or purpose.The Counselor shows the relationship between himself and his gorgeous wife Laura (Penelope Cruz), his relationship with people in the underworld including Westray (Brad Pitt) a middle man between professionals and the cartels, Reiner (Javier Bardem) a man of means, and Malkina (Cameron Diaz) the lavish girlfriend of Reiner. Other than that, things go from bad, to worse, in both the narrative of the film, and the film itself.Lacking any real storyline or empathetic characters, The Counselor serves as an ill-advised example of the power within Hollywood. Following in the footsteps of other complete disaster ensemble films like this year's Movie 43 and The Coen Brother's 2008 tragedy Burn After Reading, the film serves no purpose other than Diaz's amazing showcase of acrobatics, sensuality and unexplained perversion.The film itself is a stylized and beautifully shot piece of work. Sadly, pieces of art share more of an emotional response than this film does. The film is flooding with lost scenes, pathetic foreshadowing and unflinching action/reaction shots.One of the most noticeable disappointments of The Counselor is its script. Acclaimed author Cormac McCarthy is a recognized and respected writing force. So many of the most striking narrative feature pieces of the last decade, including No Country For Old Men and The Road, have used McCarthy's work as source material and enhanced the characters and narrative of McCarthy's narrative worlds. In his first venture as feature screenwriter, McCarthy overcompensates with nonsense, directionless and often sleepy dialogue. I'm unsure if McCarthy was pulling inspiration from Shakespeare or Hemingway, but instead of delivering on precise, metaphorically driven, analogical monologues and conversations between characters, McCarthy simply loses his audience and instead allows his talented actors to give long-winded, spoken word lullabies.Every so often, there comes a movie that really makes me scratch my head and wonder how and why all the talented individuals involved could possibly sign on to a movie like this. The Counselor is well on its way to being one of the worst movies of 2013. Strangled with boredom that even scenes of decapitation couldn't possibly help make it even a bit interesting, The Counselor is a failed attempt for everyone involved but Diaz. Diaz will surely be remembered for years to come for her scene atop a bright yellow Ferrari, a vacant golf course and a priceless face made by Bardem, who encompasses the feeling of the whole movie, with one facial expression. Disbelief is the best way to describe it, or gynecological, if that even makes sense, because nothing in this film attempts to make sense. This film is in desperate need of some professional help.Night Film Reviews Rating: 2/10 Stars (Just For The Ferrari Scene).",The Counselor
103,TheFilmGuy1,A Very Interesting Film Indeed,7,3 December 2014,"The Counselor is quite the interesting film. I saw the trailer to it and thought it looked great. When it came out in theaters, I heard pretty bad things about it. I just recently picked up the bluray to give it a chance. While I do certainly have gripes with it, I actually liked it more than I expected I would. I'd like to start with what I liked about it, since most people just rip the film apart. First off, I thought the visual style and atmosphere that the visuals help build was really good. It's a nice looking movie, and that can't be denied. It also has a plot that had me interested. In one way it's something we have seen done before, but something about the way the characters come together worked for me. It's also quite the dark film, and I can appreciate that since many films don't go as dark as this. I also think Fassbender gives a very good performance. Even Penelope Cruz is good in a role that makes you almost fall in love with her yourself.Now, onto the negatives. One huge issue is the script. It's been said before, but it seems like it would work better in a book than it does on film. It was written by Cormac McCarthy who has written many great books, some one which have been adapted to films. But this is just too far on the literature side of things than it is the film side. But one thing that really changes my view of this is the fact that I watched only the unrated extended cut. A lot of the sequences that I had issues with were ones that weren't in the theatrical cut, only the extended cut. But at the same time, these scenes felt like they were needed. The reason why I feel this is because while these dialogue scenes didn't add anything to the main plot at all, without them we wouldn't get enough scenes with the characters. These scenes are simply people telling stories that at the end of the day are just random unrelated tales. Some of the stories added in the extended cut also add an element of foreshadowing that becomes so heavy that we almost know exactly what will happen at the end, ruining some of the suspense. It's as if even though they don't develop the characters, we need them in order for those specific characters to have enough screen presence for them to matter at all. Obviously if these scenes had been replaced by really good character development, the film could have been improved drastically. There's also a few sequences in the extended cut that really don't seem to add much, even if they are kinda cool on their own. There's a phone call between Penelope Cruz and Cameron Diaz that I like, and there's even an extended opening sequence with Fassbender and Cruz that is extremely erotic and I think works amazingly well to establish their relationship from the start. It's hard for me to say whether the film is vastly improved by this extended cut, or if watching the theatrical cut without them would be better. I really don't know, but perhaps I will write a review of the theatrical cut if I ever watch that.A big mis-step for me is letting a certain character come out on top. I won't spoil who, but the character whom I hated the most (and the actor who played the character) ends up kind of coming out unscathed. I think with a better actor, the characters actions and the ending itself would have been good, but in this case it just doesn't work. It reminds me a lot of the ending of Trance (2013) where a certain character comes out on top, but it just doesn't feel satisfying because of the actor in the role, and it instead angers you.At the end of the day, I did like this film. It has many things working for it. It's just disappointing because you can see exactly where it fails, and if those things had been fixed, the film would have been incredible. I would still say its underrated considering how much crap people give it.",The Counselor
104,pontus-randen,What a gem!,8,28 January 2014,"I do not know anything about Cormac McCarthy, but from the language in this movie I would think he is very eloquent and thought provoking.Role play is super. Especially from Michael Fassbender, who is nothing short of stunning. Cameron Diaz carves out a new niche for herself as a witch, something she is obviously much better at than doing comics.The movie itself? Slow paced, beautiful and full of evidence of the drug world's sinister approach to revenge and death. It clearly depicts a world you do not want to end up in and where only the most ruthless and evil people can reach the top. If they are lucky. Meaningless Death just as a sport and show of force.Wow!",The Counselor
105,azanti0029,I wanted to like this film but I just couldn't because there was no character to like in it...,4,20 October 2014,"The Counsellor is throw back to the film noir detective anti hero films of the 50s and to some degree the thrillers of the 1970s but some how it manages to be neither. Different people seek to double cross each other in deals gone wrong either side of the Mexican border. I will fully accept that Mr Scott may not have been at the top of his game during filming this production due to the loss of his brother, but the most fundamental mistake here seems to be a character we care about and the film unfortunately seems to lack one.Michael Fassbender for reasons it is felt are best not explained to us is a reasonably successful professional (I already forget if he was a lawyer or an accountant) who has an attractive wife (Cruz) but has some murky friends (Bardem) who seem able to convince him to embark on a get even richer quicker drug deal which goes horribly wrong when the wife of Bardem (Diaz) is double crossing everyone. With several heavy weights filling out the cast this is the one thing that makes the film actually watchable and several of them turn in nice performances but that cannot save it was a script that lacks a clear coherent narrative. The whole thing comes to a rather bloody conclusion and your left wondering who on earth you were rooting for and when you conclude that the answer is no one, your not really helped much by the most unlikable character winning the day. Perhaps the point of the film was to say sometimes good guys finish last, but there isn't any really good guys in the movie to begin with, just people who are different degrees of dis-likable. Perhaps it was to say that if you live on the dark side of the law bad things happen, well okay but that in itself isn't strong enough to make this a great piece of cinema. While the cinematography is outstanding and everyone has nice little character touches and eccentricities that you could well believe in some cases its not enough to rescue you from taking such an arduous journey with them. Scott has already proved he doesn't make everything he touches turn to gold with the over inflated Prometheus. Here the film is even less interesting when in a plot that we fail to really grab a group of people we don't really care about do some bad things to other people we care even less about. Sadly flawed.",The Counselor
106,Bob_the_Hobo,A Layered and Complex Mess,5,29 October 2013,"A nameless attorney, called The Counselor (Michael Fassbender) has everything going for him: a good job, powerful friends, and an engagement to his beautiful girlfriend Laura (Penelope Cruz). But greed trumps comfort as the Counselor's friend Reiner (Javier Bardem) involves him in drug trade along the U.S.-Mexico border. As the deal goes bad, the nameless attorney has to pick up the pieces and try to either put his life back in place or flee the vanity that he has slowly become accustomed to.The second the screen went black, I knew I hadn't seen a great film. But I also knew I hadn't seen a bad film. The Counselor has brief moments of genius that flash as bright as any classic, but also shares pedantic, drawn-out scenes that seem like filler. It boasts an A-list cast turning in terrific performances, but none seem to know exactly what they are doing, or what their purpose is to the story. There is no doubt that The Counselor has a profound message, but the message gets bogged down in the confusion of important questions the script has no answers to. Written by the incredible author Cormac McCarthy, who wrote a similarly simple and violent book-turned movie called No Country For Old Men, the script follows five characters; the aforementioned, Reiner's oversexed girlfriend Malkina (Cameron Diaz), and the mysterious cowboy middleman Westray (Brad Pitt). Reiner and Malkina's flamboyant and malicious relationship is a perfect counter to the comfortable, unexciting romance between the title character and his fiancé. The Counselor and Laura's unexceptional wardrobe is no comparison to Reiner's expensive suits and cropped-up hair, or Malkina's leave-nothing-to-the-imagination dresses.Michael Fassbender is on a career roll, almost guaranteed an Oscar for Twelve Years A Slave, later this year. Yet his performance is surprisingly bland, more a reactionary character than one deciding his own fate. Brad Pitt does particularly fine work here as Westray. Clad in garb (cowboy hat, boots, cream or watermelon-colored jacket) you would see in every El Paso street corner, Westray is an unassuming and cautionary man who, in the film's first half anyway, seems to be guiding the story more than being part of it. Westray's fate at the end is certainly surprising to any viewer thinking Pitt was cast as simply another name to round out the cast. Pitt is likely the best performance in the film. The problems with the film do not lie in performances or direction. The photography is stunning, with beautifully shot locations in El Paso and Mexico. Reiner's glamorous home is taken right out of GQ Magazine, with its lavish pools and party atmosphere. The scenes in Mexico show a gritty, violent place where money rules, but so it also does across the border. What McCarthy is trying to convey from his work is present in the film, but a few lines on certain aspects of the plot would be helpful. For instance, how exactly was Fassbender involved? How was Reiner? The Wire Man was an imposing and violent force, but who was he? Who did he work for? And who was Malkina, really? As you watch the film, you will see such unanswered questions. If you are a fan of Cormac McCarthy, as I am, you will probably leave the theater with the same emotion I did; one of confusion. The Counselor is not a bad film, but it is far from great. At the same token, the finished product could be great to another viewer, and I would understand why. It may require a second viewing and a more in-depth analysis of the complexity of the film to understand exactly what was going on. A rating of ""five"" is the best rating I can give. It seems as if half of the The Counselor was there, and half of him was not.",The Counselor
107,masterjk2,Ridiculous Ridley,4,5 October 2014,"Someplace here there was a tale to tell. McCarthy must of been high on dope when he wrote this existential screenplay. It starts with an engrossing :-) love scene between two stars under a sheet. The rest of the plot is about as obfuscated. Scott is usually a better storyteller than this. People come from nowhere and shoot 'em up. There are long diatribes about the meaning of life which are meaningless. Who knew cartellers read Kant and Schopenhauer? No one survives but the the evil cat woman. How this ""Counselor"" got himself into such a mess is never made clear. Why Bardem's character ever trusted his mistress is even more opaque. Why anyone thought this could pass for good film-making is ludicrous.The best acting is accomplished by the Cheetahs. Their grace in killing is far more natural than anything else in this dumbfoundingly stupid movie.No stars for anything but the cinematography.",The Counselor
108,JPfanatic93,"Cheetahs, diamonds, car copulating and greedy women, and somewhere there is drugs involved too",6,4 December 2013,"According to Cormac McCarthy, acclaimed author of novels such as No Country for Old Men and The Road (and thus indirectly also responsible for two great cinematic adaptations of said works), hell hath no fury like a woman hungry. In his screen writing debut, The Counselor, we learn a thing or two about women for sure. They can be the most scheming, conniving, ruthlessly intelligent and sexually uninhibited creatures imaginable, or they can be loving, charming wives-to-be instead, though the former eats the latter for lunch if left to her shady devices. McCarthy also means to inform his audience on a diverse range of other assorted topics with this film, including the make-up of diamonds, the dangers of speeding (which can lead to both incarceration and decapitation), the sexually stimulating nature of fast cars and the machinations of a deadly device called a bolito (which we will end up seeing in working order in much more detail than we would like to have seen before the film is over) but the exact workings of the film's main topic, a drug deal gone horribly awry, remain rather elusive by comparison. McCarthy proves he's as consistent in his job as a screen writer as he is a novelist, as he keeps dabbling in the cynical realm associated with man's darker, greedier nature, but coherency unfortunately is not his strong suit as evidenced here.The Counselor features all the ingredients of a strong, effective film, including an intriguing premise, a top-notch director in the person of Sir Ridley Scott and a solid cast to match. The counselor in question is an otherwise nameless man (Michael Fassbender) who leads a seemingly happy life with his fiancé Laura (Penelope Cruz), but aspires to gain much more by better playing his card of being in a position of influence, which leads him to the decision of getting involved in a lucrative but risky drug deal. His associates, the flamboyant bon-vivant Reiner (Javier Bardem) and the cautionary Westray (Brad Pitt) tell him of the dangers of such deals in juicy details (most of which we will see come to bloody fruition in a grand case of cinematic parallelism), but the counselor accepts the job nonetheless. You know this charming man is gonna regret his choice well before he actually makes it, but you'll find him sympathetic enough to root for him to be successful in this venture. When the trafficker loses his head, someone at the top of the game loses a lot of money, patience and general goodwill towards man, which leads to everybody's necessity to bail out immediately or face grave, disturbing consequences. Reiner's girlfriend Malkina (Cameron Diaz), a woman as gorgeous as she is devious and greedy above all else, soon seems to be pulling all the strings and relentlessly hunts the money and those in her way. A killing spree erupts, in which a fair share of people, decent and not so decent alike, lose it all, during which the counselor must come to terms with the very bad call he made, one we always knew from the get-go would come to this conclusion. This film sounds very much like a thriller, which it wants to be, but the amount of thrills it offers comes up short. In fact, the first half of the movie is comprised of endless dialogue, some beautifully written, some less catchy, but much of it quite digressing and ultimately redundant. When the sh!t finally hits the fan, it does so with a vengeance in a bunch of short, brutal bursts, but by that time many spectators will have seized to care, or worse, failed to understand just what is going on and who is connected to who in the ultimate scheme of things considering the many players and their complicated and underdeveloped interrelations.Nevertheless, what The Counselor lacks in terms of writing, Sir Ridley often makes up for to some extent in directing, as the film's best moments are largely cinematic in nature, including the drug dealer accidentally shot in the head and immediately robbed by local vagabonds before being devoured by his own cheetahs, as well as the already infamous scene displaying Malkina's inexplicable drive to copulate with a nice car (Cameron certainly goes for it!), an ecstatic moment of absurdity that ruins the ride for its bewildered owner. The Counselor has all the hallmarks of a flawed masterpiece, as everything is necessary to craft a grand, suspenseful film, but none of it is arranged in the correct order and the dominant overall tone of cynicism, McCarthy's overarching theme, makes it hard to behold as it schemes its way towards an unsettling climax.",The Counselor
109,FilmMuscle,Who Should Be The One Counseling?,5,26 October 2013,"Normally, I fully appreciate bleak films with utterly despicable characters that leave you thinking rather than leaving the theater with a smile on your face, joyous to the fact that the hero saved the day yet again. Sorry, that's not my kind of story as overdone as it is. I prefer brutal realism where humanity is depicted in a much less phony manner. That's exactly what The Counselor promises as its characters take fairly regrettable paths- flawed people that make mistakes in a criminal environment. Some are more oblivious to it (or outright merciless), and some are much more humane in their methods. At first glance, it seems as if it's impossible for The Counselor to be proved a disappointment from the looks of its amazing cast (the likes of Michael Fassbender, Javier Bardem, Cameron Diaz, Brad Pitt, and Penelope Cruz), exceptional director with a credible resume, and a totally prestigious author signed on for his first screenplay. In addition, it appears to be a crime thriller, which definitely commences my adrenaline rush because it's personally my favorite genre. Unfortunately, this film is a perfect example of ""don't judge a book by its cover"" (whether positively or negatively; people just love positivism so they usually associate the idiom with negativism). To simply put it, the story is a complete mess right from the start. We have our main character who goes by ""Counselor"" (played by one of my favorites, Michael Fassbender) confusingly dropped into this situation. How did he end up in this predicament? Why did he choose to pursue such a perilous and illicit path? Basically, the movie never explains anything. You're left in wonderment, attempting to figure out who is on whose side. Who wants to kill them exactly? Characters end up in random places, and the story never even bothers to explain how the two characters even know each other. The script just conveniently places two movie stars in one scene without an effectively developed context to service it. What follows are countless scenes where characters engage in conversation, vaguely discussing the circumstances. The dialogue also feels vastly strange because the characters don't talk like actual people do in reality. Their speech sounds quite literary as they spout metaphor after metaphor, coupled with complex vocabulary. With that being said, I had no issue with it at first. In that, I mean I held no issue with the style of speech. What I did have an issue with was the way the characters spoke in a way that fully befuddled the viewers. It's like only the characters are in on it the entire way without the audience's understanding. In essence, it makes for an inconvenient and confusing experience. Speaking of the cast, Javier Bardem was really the only one that stood out to me. Frankly, Cameron Diaz had me bewildered. She's supposed to be from Barbados with an accent- See, I wasn't even sure whether she was sporting an accent or not. At times, it felt like she had an accent going on, and then in other moments, she was speaking fluent and clear English; so I have no idea what was going on there. Even then, the film could've easily hidden all these flaws by presenting us with a thrilling and suspenseful plot, but it actually turned out to be incredibly uneventful. The scope didn't feel as exciting as it was supposed to be, and it definitely wasted an incredible amount of potential. So yes, I'm absolutely saddened; this was one of my most anticipated films of this year, if not my most anticipated, and it ended up falling embarrassingly flat. There were a few disturbingly violent scenes that boosted the film's tone, for lack of a better term, literally, and reminded us of the excellence of No Country for Old Men. You're also met with an outrageous sex scene that's equally disturbing and sexy for some, and those scenes might be the only snippets of The Counselor remembered down the road. The ending was also not very reassuring, cutting to the credits unexpectedly shortly after another monotonous and ambiguous conversation. The only decent element of this movie was its soundtrack, but then again, its quality could've just been determined in comparison to the oddity and nuisance that the rest of the film consisted of. In sum, the best way to describe The Counselor is ""brutally unsatisfying."" I felt no sense of satisfaction by the time it drew to a close, and everything simply felt so meaningless and forgettable. There's no question that it left a bad taste in my mouth, and I sincerely hope that Ridley Scott ups his game sometime soon.",The Counselor

Nobody's story will ""pay off."" Characters will come and go in a ""plot"" that doesn't exist. Tears are shed. Bullets are expended. But essentially you only need to know this is about greed and survival and an exercise in the flow of money and words.

112,silverton-37959,What's revelatory is a letdown,5,7 April 2021,"This is a spoiler review.When everything starts to come down on the four main characters, the viewer is left wondering what has happened and why it happened. It soon becomes apparent that the ambush of ""The Green Hornet"" via a steel cable strung across the road that decapitates him, was set in motion by Marinka, the character portrayed by Cameron Diaz, who has planned the theft of the truck with the shipment in it.She has been gathering information on the deal that is being done by Counselor, Reiner and Westray; listening in on conversations, etc. The two killers who spy on (and kill) Hornet work for Marinka. Hornet's mother, Ruth, awakens in the night and intuitively knows that her son has been killed. She immediately blames Counselor and sets the cartel on the three involved in the deal: Counselor, Reiner,and Westray, and also on the innocent Laura.It's a letdown to discover that Marinka is behind it all, mainly because she's already tipped Reiner and Westray off to the fact that she's evil and that something isn't right about her being with Reiner. Also, Marinka is an odious character anyway, and Cameron Diaz was well cast since she looks like an evil person. I've never understood the attraction to her. She's unattractive and looks sleazy in every role she plays.The speed with which Ruth (a cartel member in prison for murder) concludes that Counselor is involved in killing her son, is due to the fact that she doesn't like him and that she carries the idea , shared by other cartel members, that everybody is up to something. That idea is a necessary part of their makeup as criminals in a dangerous business.",The Counselor
113,murtaza_mma,A Potpourri of Vestiges Review: Ridley Scott's riveting crime thriller based on a screenplay by Cormac McCarthy,9,10 March 2014,"The Counselor presents the unfortunate tale of an unnamed lawyer, only referred to as the ""Counselor,"" who, blinded by his lust for lucre, despite being repeatedly warned against it, takes a plunge into the diabolical world of drug trafficking, exposing himself to the merciless Mexican drug cartels around the troubled El Paso–Juárez border area. The border is a metaphor for the dichotomy that exists between the civilized world that we think we have built for ourselves and real world, hiding behind its goody-goody façade, which is governed by anarchy and barbarism—a pattern that's key to celebrated American author and playwright Cormac McCarthy's oeuvre. The Counselor's self-inflicted annihilation has all the ingredients of a quintessential Shakespearean tragedy, save its contemporary setting.Films have been known to glorify murders as well as the brutal designs the perpetrators employ to manifest the figments of their gory imaginations. The Counselor depicts two such horrific designs, both of which rely on the ingenious use of alloy wire to terminate the victim. The cruelty involved in both these designs transcends imagination. It's heinous. It's insane. And, yet, it's no less glamorous. While the first design results in an instantaneous death, the second makes death look like a grand spectacle, just the kind of material that Peeping Tom would have cherished. As per the first design, an alloy wire, tied at an optimum height between two poles on the opposite sides of the road, is used to decapitate a speeding biker. The second design uses a throttling apparatus called a ""Bolito,"" wherein a loop of alloy wire is slipped over the victim's head, and a small, battery-run motor attached to it, steadily and irreversibly, tightens the loop around the throat until the carotid artery is severed. Speaking of the art of killing, there is a chilling scene in which Westray (Brad Pitt's character) gives a graphic account of a hapless young girl who was slaughtered by one of the drug cartels in order to make a snuff film for a rich client who even went on to rape her headless corpse.Vintage Ridley Scott, McCarthy's cynical world is on full display here, in all its glory. It's essentially a treacherous realm inhabited by shifty, savage beings capable of doing the most depraved deeds. McCarthy's trademark motifs of greed, lust, malice and death are omnipresent. The dialogue is gritty and replete with philosophical and spiritual overtones, a facet which makes it daunting for the viewer to imbibe it completely during the first viewing, thereby making multiple viewings essential. Here, this critic would like to draw your attention to two conversations in particular. The first takes place early in the movie wherein the great Swiss actor Bruno Ganz, playing the part of a Jewish diamond dealer, delivers a haunting lecture in philosophy. The second takes place towards the end of the film during which Rubén Blades' character Jefe demystifies the true meaning of life and death for the Counselor. Barring these two exchanges the movie has several interesting interactions that the Counselor has with Reiner (Javier Bardem's character) and Westray. The Counselor serves to be a highlight-reel of some of the most graphic and gory scenes every filmed in cinema. And, while these disturbing sequences may enthrall a serious film-goer or a lover of the crime thriller genre, they are bound to repulse the uninitiated lot. Perhaps, it's one of the reasons why the movie failed to impress at the box office. Then, there's the movie's ending that may not seem satisfactory to everyone. But, despite its serious nature, the material is not devoid of humor and sex—a great respite for the casual viewers who are liable to get restless when exposed to a relatively heavy dose of material.Overall, The Counselor comes across as a multifaceted work of cinema that underlines what a team of a seasoned director and a gifted writer is capable of delivering and yet so rarely delivers. A star studded ensemble cast, for once, doesn't end up overshadowing the movie's narrative and, if anything, it only strengthens it. Michael Fassbender, who plays the titular role, delivers yet another gutsy performance during which he goes through a gamut of emotions, once again demonstrating his remarkable acting range. Cameron Diaz is an absolute delight to watch as the quintessential mobster's moll. As Malkina, she is the epitome of feminine villainy and charm. To watch the coldblooded Malkina go about her business is to witness a bloodthirsty predator playing with its helpless prey. Diaz delivers the definitive performance of her career; it's indeed sad that despite giving such a thorough performance she has gone completely unnoticed at this year's major award functions. Javier Bardem, never the one to disappoint, looks exquisite in the role of a sybaritic drug kingpin. Penélope Cruz looks steaming hot as the Counselor's love interest, Laura, especially in the opening bedroom scene she shares with Fassbender. Brad Pitt gets limited screen time but steals every scene that he is a part of. The final scene featuring Westray with a Bolito around his neck is truly unforgettable.

114,rusoviet,I found the film phenomenally well scripted and...,10,18 January 2017,".... fail to understand the avalanche of others who comment with hard disdain. The movie dealt with the most base of human drives - greed and jealousy. These drive the movie from start to finish.It is the unnamed 'counselor' that the film continues to return to We are never told Fassbinder's actual name. He pops in and out of the script and yet it is his act of charity towards a woman who comes around to blame him for her son's demise and painful end.Fassbender is warned to consider the risks in investing in this 'deal' and even though his '%' is small he and the woman he loves will suffer for his 'greed'.Brad Pitt, increasingly in all films, is the weakest link in the cast.The Counselor is a very nuanced film that tells a rich story of empty souls who have no peace and know not when their very lives will suddenly end.Great film",The Counselor
115,PassPopcorn,Pass the Popcorn review,6,14 November 2013,"The Counselor seemed like it was going to be one of this year's best movies. It had everything: a good director, a writer famous for writing the novel No Country for Old Men, and a cast of talented actors including Micheal Fassbender, Javier Bardem, Penélope Cruz, Brad Pitt and uhmh Cameron Diaz. Unfortunately, after watching the move I must say The Counselor wasn't as great as I expected it to be. Also, labeling The Counselor as 'not-really-that-great' could be somewhat of an understatement; it would be more precise to say that The Counselor is, to some extent, a bad movie.The movie mainly follows Michael Fassbender's character – who is never addressed by his name, only by his profession (he is, surprisingly, a counselor) – who proposes to his beautiful girlfriend Laura (Penélope Cruz). However, he is short of money, so he goes into an illegal drug job with his acquaintance Reiner (Javier Bardem). Reiner screws a woman named Malkina (Cameron Diaz) – not that it matters very much in this content, but she is one of the key characters in the movie. Also, Brad Pitt is somewhere in the movie, playing a character named Westray.You might notice in my summary that I was very vague in describing the movie's plot, because that is precisely the movie's main problem – it is rather vague. It is never established, during the whole movie, the connections the characters have with the actual plot, or even the connections among the characters. The audience is never involved in the characters, or the illegal drug job that inevitably goes bad, and therefore can't have an emotional reaction when things go wrong. In that aspect the movie is vague, underwhelming and even tedious sometimes. And while the overall bleakness of the movie might have some (in lack of a better word) stylistic charm, this vague nature of The Counselor is often unnaturally abrupted by some rather specific scenes that lead absolutely nowhere. So, if you hate conventional narrative devices and just want to watch a movie that has completely pointless scenes, like the one in which Dean Norris and John Leguizamo talk about a dead body in a barrel, I've got good news for you.Speaking of vague writing, I had some problems with the movie's dialogue, which was occasionally clingy – mostly the lines spoken by Cameron Diaz. I'm not a big Diaz fan overall, and she even did quite a nice job in The Counselor, but the way she sometimes delivered the lines made me giggle. The rest of the cast was good likewise, which isn't a surprise since they are all experienced actors, and I won't spend much time talking about them. As for Ridley Scott, I'd suggest he retires and stops making movies which are not bad, but are ultimately utterly disappointing. And that's what The Counselor is – utterly disappointing.Rating: 6/10 Read more at http://passpopcorn.com/",The Counselor
116,caseymoviemania,"Despite A-list cast and some shocking act of violence, THE COUNSELOR is too wordy to thrill.",3,3 February 2014,"At the first glance, THE COUNSELOR seems like one of the must-see movies of 2013 (and yes, it was banned here in Malaysia): there's Ridley Scott (PROMETHEUS) on the director's chair; acclaimed author Cormac McCarthy (NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN) making his first screen writing debut; and an A-list cast featuring Michael Fassbender, Javier Bardem, Cameron Diaz, Penelope Cruz and Brad Pitt. With the amount of talents involved, this movie is seriously hard to ignore. But upon finally watching it, I was floored by the disappointing outcome of this movie.WHAT IS IT ALL ABOUT?THE COUNSELOR revolves around the unnamed title character (Michael Fassbender), a Texas attorney who is about to marry his beautiful girlfriend, Laura (Penelope Cruz). He gets himself involved in a US-Mexico drug deal with a shady middleman named Westray (Brad Pitt), simply because he needs money to pay for a 3.8 karat diamond of engagement ring and live a lavish lifestyle. When the drug deal starts to go wrong, the counselor lands himself in a deep trouble that everyone else involved with him will pay the price.THE GOOD STUFFThe movie's sudden burst of graphic violence is simply shocking, especially the one involved ""bolito"" -- a mechanical device comprising a loop of alloy wire attached to a small electric motor at which the wearer's head will be decapitated when the loop is tightened around the neck. Technical credits are top notch, including Dariusz Wolski's lush cinematography, Daniel Pemberton's unusual music score and of course, Arthur Max's slick production design that deserved some mentions here.Javier Bardem is perfectly typecast as the counselor's flamboyant wealthy friend, Reiner while Cameron Diaz steals the show as Reiner's vicious girlfriend, Malkina. As Laura, Penelope Cruz makes full use of her limited screen time hitting all the right notes as the counselor's naive girlfriend and bride-to-be.MOST MEMORABLE MOMENT(S)The controversial, yet bizarre scene involving Malkina having ""sex"" on Reiner's yellow Ferrari. Another one of course, is the graphically violent scene involving the fate of Westray's life.THE BAD STUFFRidley Scott's direction is unusually restrained here, which in turns, becomes his huge mistake because he let Cormac McCarthy's wordy screenplay do all the talking. Although McCarthy is a highly-acclaimed author who has unusual talent for words, he fails miserably as a screenwriter simply because he makes every scene a chore to sit through. Almost every conversation involving two characters interacting each other will last about ten minutes or so. Problem is, McCarthy's love for verbose dialogues are heavy-handed, yet so boring to hear. He should have learn a thing or two from better screenwriter like David Mamet or Quentin Tarantino when comes to talky pictures. Not surprisingly, THE COUNSELOR feels terribly draggy at an almost two hours long. If that's not bad enough, the movie is also noticeably lack of thrills while the anticlimactic ending is such a huge disappointment it might leaves you hanging with... Is that it?As the title character, it's such a waste that Michael Fassbender's would-be impressive performance is sadly underdeveloped.FINAL WORDSTHE COUNSELOR is simply one of the worst movies in 2013. For those who have trouble sleeping all the time, watching this movie might helps.caseymoviemania.blogspot.com",The Counselor
117,georgioskarpouzas,Evil prevails,5,24 November 2013,"This is a very strange movie one of the strangest I have ever seen. It has great actors, a plot impossible to understand, murders and death, sexual perversion, able cinematography, philosophical villains and disgusting morals.The point of the movie is very simple.Evil rules human life and the more evil you are the best chances you have to survive. The most moral character of the movie meets the worst fate, the worst character prevails. It seems the whole movie was made to vindicate the worldview of the Marquis De Sade! All this is rather simple really and it does not need to be explained in literary platitudes. Neither it is something original. What's the point of having a stellar cast and an obviously big budget to reach such a humdrum conclusion?Obviously some people, the screen-play writer whom I did not know but who seems to be rather famous, have a morbid fascination with the human propensity for evil and perversity. I do not want to create spoilers but if you watch the movie with some attention the kind of fate at least two of the main characters shall meet latter becomes more than obvious, this movie have the subtlety of an hippopotamus. I mean it simply is as plain as having wolfs making sermons to seep about the futility and brevity of life before they eat them. Does this thing make for great art, subtlety and insight to the human condition as quite a lot of reviewers state or imply?In my opinion no although my view may be in a degree conditioned by the fact that I find the morality of the movie repulsive and therefore I punish the whole movie based on the wrong criteria. I did not like this movie I had a bad feeling leaving the theatre. On the other hand I liked the actors. They weren't characters they were human allegories for the passions of the soul. Cameron Diaz symbolized the naked will to prevail and sexuality without confines. In Freudian terms the urge for aggression and the sexual urge unhinged by any moral constrains. The prosperity of vice to site one of Sade's novels. Cruz was the Lilly of the valley that was the prey of a cruel and perverse world. The Counsellor was the good man who took a wrong path and was destroyed(although there is no explaining which was his motive for evil-doing despite the continual warnings to do otherwise-the only conclusion is that he did for kicks for its own sake).Two other characters exist played by Bardem and Pitt who are very colorful in terms of character as well as in terms of stylistic choices. They are the ones who warn the hero of the fate that awaits him.You could say that all this has allusions to Elizabethan tragedies and drama but this is an overstatement. And one must note that the way Mexicans are portrayed confirms all the Wasp stereotypes about them.But one thing is certain, this film will gain a cult following among all those who pride themselves for having understood the true workings of nature and society under the hypocritical facade of the JudeoChristian ethic. Their self- satisfaction will gain an immense boost- as if one had slapped the Pope publicly the moment he went to bless the public in St Peter's Square after his election....",The Counselor
118,The_moan_of_all_moans,Well i'll need some counselling after this.,4,25 November 2013,"The trailer to this film gave you so much to hope for; directed by the mighty Ridley Scott, starring great talents such as Javier Bardem, Penelope Cruz and Michael Fassbender and what came across in the trailer as an intriguing insight into drug trafficking. Even the soundtrack added to the excitement.I don't mention Cameron Diaz and Brad Pitt due to the fact they are not great and to be honest they suck a lot of intensity out the film with their drab acting. And it is their lackluster performance which contribute to the films downward spiral. Yes, it is apparent that instead of spelling it out for you, it instead opts for cryptic like conversations and every scene is a piece to the puzzle, but it isn't exactly cluedo like. I knew (as i'm sure everyone did) exactly who was the mastermind. Maybe it was meant to be obvious, but the film had this mysterious aura about it throughout, so when the culmination comes you are left thinking....well i already knew that. There is no payoff. And normally i don't mind a film that just takes a scenario and gives you a realistic outcome, but with this is just seemed flat. And as i said before a lot of that flatness is to do with Cameron Diaz and Brad Pitt. They are so past it, in terms of passion. They both comes across very unnatural, and in a film like this they need to be more convincing.The dialogue is great to listen to and Javier Bardem and Fassbender where great but the meaningful(yet meaningless) conversations and their efforts unfortunately can't save this film from being a failure.",The Counselor
119,radhrh,Disappointing is such a limited word...,1,1 February 2014,"Do the math, take an all star cast where even the likes of Rosie Perez and John Leguizamo play only bit parts, add the writing talents of Cormac McCarthy then put one of the greatest (if not the greatest) movie directors of his generation in charge and wrap it all up in a tale of greed and depravity you should be onto something pretty special. To say I was gasping to see this would have been an understatement.However, the result, instead of being a gripping piece of movie making destined to become a classic, is an overlong, predictable, contrived and pretentious piece of junk. I would like to have termed it filth but that would imply it elicited some kind of reaction other than simple boredom.The film is basically a series of long winded one on one conversations between the various cast members that are intended to be deep and meaningful but are instead merely pretentious and dull. It is rare to see more than 2 characters on screen at the same time. I won't bore you with the plot, such as it is apart from to say it is as predictable and clichéd as it is full of holes. There are no surprises, there are no twists, there is no humour, there is no tension, there is very little action, just a bunch of blah blah blah which is in itself completely unrealistic, who talks like this anyway?

120,jake_fantom,One of the very worst,1,1 June 2014,"This is one of the ripest pieces of cinematic drivel ever to hit the screen. Has Cormac McCarthy been fooling us all this time into thinking he could write? The script is so inane, so weighted down with meaningless philosophical mumbo-jumbo, so filled with dialog that doesn't ring true and plot twists you can see coming a mile away, that I honestly must call into question Cormac McCarthy's writing skills. The film opens with one of the most excruciatingly awful erotic encounters ever committed to film -- the dialog makes you want to hide behind your couch. And the characters! What an atrocious piece of coarse acting Ridley Scott has coaxed out of Javier Bardem, normally one of my favorite actors. And what's with that haircut? Are they trying to top the pageboy in No Country For Old Men? There's nothing really good about this film, but it's hard to make a film without a script -- and what passes for a script in this case should have sent the investors running for the hills.",The Counselor
121,pefrss,I always thought men are making love to their Ferraris,8,25 October 2013,"I will go and see Javier Bardem in any movie he plays in. Sometimes I get punished for this indulgence, like for example when I saw Eat, Pray, Love, which must be one of worst movies on my personal list. Watching the trailers and the promotion for this film I was a little bit reluctant to see the Counselor as I avoid violent films. I only went to see ' No country for old men', because the reviews were so good and Javier Bardem was in it :]. The film opens under the covers and Penelope Cruz as the love interest of the counselor aka Fassbender tries to be sexy , but I have seen Cruz in other movies where she was much more enticing, like for example in Vicky, Christina. Barcelona. The dialog throughout the film is outstanding , sophisticated and unexpected. It is difficult to get it all, I may have to see the film again.Yes, I was confused like everybody else but the movie stayed with me in a positive way. I wanted to read novels by the author because I liked the way he was thinking and I wanted to see the film again to get more of the symbolism. I caught myself grinning thinking about the scene when Cameron Diaz has sex with the Ferrari. After all men buy these cars so that women have sex with them, but turning it around and let the woman have sex with the car instead, is just hilarious. I am sure, I missed some other things, so I will definitely go and see the Counselor again. The story is realistic , at least after all what you see in the news, drug dealing is a cruel and merciless business and whoever gets involved in it ends up paying the price for it eventually. Some characters are a little bit overdrawn for my taste. I am not a big fan of Cameron Diaz and her character seemed more like something out of cartoon than real life, her humping the Ferrari is certainly memorable, if nothing else. The same goes for Javier Bardem (he does not hump a Ferrari, but he looks ridiculous too), but he of course can act and makes up for his hairdo and outfits by giving a great performance. Brad Pitt too looks like a cartoon from another era and I was trying to figure out what the director intended by so over exaggerating. Of course like always in the movies they lived in incredible stylish houses which did not match their personalities , but I guess somebody got paid a pretty good penny to let them film there. It is a confusing film, I will certainly see it again and I may add it to my DVD collection. I gave the movie a rating of eight because there were more things I liked than I disliked.",The Counselor
122,pcrprimer,Collapses under the weight of its ambition,6,5 February 2014,"With a star-studded cast, premier director, and a Pulitzer-prize winning author as a screenwriter, it would be assumed that this would be one of the best movies of the year. Unfortunately, this movie really underwhelms. The directing and cinematography is very good with some very nice shots of Southwestern USA. The performances are very strong by all the lead actors, with Javier Bardem in particular standing out as the colourfully dressed entrepreneur. The main problem with the movie is the script which leads to the actors giving long, uninterrupted monologues. I feel that in an effort to give a symbolic meaning, and strong themes, the movie suffered. If it just stayed the course as a normal thriller, the movie would have been a lot more enjoyable. **Spoiler** As an aside, I still don't understand what the exact nature of the drug deal was, and why Fassbender's character told Cruz's character to just stay at home and wait then meet in a different city. You'd think if the cartel was after your significant other, that you would have a better plan than simply drive yourself to the airport and see you in a couple of days.",The Counselor

124,toddg-473-289818,Too many unanswered questions,4,26 April 2014,"This movie started out great, with an all star cast, and a tale of the brutality of the drug running business on the southern U.S. border. From there it became too philosophical, with long, meaningless conversations with unidentified characters about the futility of thinking there is a way out of a bad situation once it goes wrong.An immediate list of unanswered questions comes to mind: Who were the last two people that Michael Fassbender's character spoke to at the end of the movie? One was in person and the other was on the phone. We never learn how they are relevant to the plot, or to any of the other characters in the movie. Next, was Cameron Diaz's character tied to the Cartel, or is she simply a lone wolf, waiting for other people to kill one another off so that she can be the last man (woman) standing and collect the money? Why make Fassbender's character a lawyer? The only reference to him being a lawyer was when he visits Rosie Perez's character in prison and helps to get her son out of jail for a speeding ticket. Any other type of character would have filled this script adequately, so long as it was made clear that the protagonist's character was a straight and narrow type, naive and clueless as to how the drug business works. In fact, we don't even learn why Fassbender's character gets involved in the first place, other than a vague reference to him being short on cash. Yet he drives a convertible Bentley and flies off to Amsterdam to buy an expensive diamond ring for his fiancée. So why risk it all? We in the audience could have sympathized more with his character had we be given a better explanations of his motivations.Having referenced the characters played by Fassbender and Diaz, I would compliment both of their acting performances. Fassbender, in realizing his world is coming apart, slowly evolves into a weakened shell of his former self, and Diaz is believable as a cold, calculating eccentric black widow type. Fortunately her acting has matured from earlier portrayals of cold hearted characters in movies like Vanilla Sky and Any Given Sunday, in which her acting was far from convincing.Other performances by Brad Pitt and Javier Bardem were entertaining, although they seemed more like caricatures of themselves than believable elements to the story. Overall, this movie could have been better if the audience hadn't been purposefully kept in the dark on so many levels.",The Counselor
125,hkauteur,HK Auteur film review - The Counselor,4,14 February 2014,"To give the simplest summary of the latest film from Ridley Scott and first-time screenwriter Cormac McCarthy, the Counselor (Michael Fassbender), deeply in love with his fiancée Laura (Penelope Cruz), tries to make a quick score in a one-time drug deal with Reiner (Javier Bardem), his girlfriend Malkina (Cameron Diaz) and middleman Westray (Brad Pitt). The deal backfires, and now The Counselor is wrongfully targeted by a Mexican drug cartel. So Cormac McCarthy, Ridley Scott, Michael Fassbender, Brad Pitt, Javier Bardem, Penelope Cruz and Cameron Diaz in a monumental cinematic failure, what happened? Let's be clear. The true author of The Counselor is Cormac McCarthy, not Ridley Scott. The artistic choices that McCarthy is attempting with the script are evident. He seems to have a disdain for exposition, as most of the scenes start and end before the typical story movements in a plot. What remains are these existential conversations that occur after a lot of the action has taken place. McCarthy thinks that by removing story explanation, the film's themes and ideas will float to the surface. The dialogue just drones on and on and on non-stop, having the viewer scratching their heads trying to keep up with it. As a result, there is no time to absorb the themes and ideas that McCarthy is trying to communicate. Audiences can tune to a different syntax (i.e. Yoda or Nadsat from A Clockwork Orange) and absorb heavy themes, but it is hard to do both at the same time. Michael Fassbender carries the film sufficiently on his shoulder by adding as much believability as possible and together with Penelope Cruz make a good solid emotional anchor with their love story. Javier Bardem does his trademark brand of 'psychotic hair acting', fashioning a spiky hairstyle that looks like he is forcibly pulling out his hair with hair gel. Brad Pitt's character just seems like an odd combination of character quirks that comes off more shallow. It is hard to buy Bardem and Pitt's characters because gangsters would never philosophize and advise their underlings like old wise sages. Cameron Diaz is the odd one out and it is hard to judge her performance. It took me a while to realize that Malkina character was from Barbados, and apparently she put on an accent for it, but it was undetectable. The role is something we never seen from Diaz before and it is a wild explosive left-field character. I just don't know what to make of it. Every actor is delivering on what is written, but it's hard to judge if it's good or bad acting because the performances do not add up to the sum of its parts. The actors are not to be blamed.The final conclusion I can draw is that director Ridley Scott and the cast believed that Cormac McCarthy has written something great and have proceeded to honor it by acting it out unedited as if it was Shakespeare. Had they been more critical about the screenplay and its mechanics, something more profound definitely could have been made. From what McCarthy is trying to say with these themes, he would have done better by just writing a philosophy paper about greed and corruption. As a bleak morality tale, it is not at all compelling. The Counselor is not a film I would recommend people to see for leisure, but anybody with an interest in screen writing should give it a watch to study the forensics and learn what not to do, even if you are a critically acclaimed novelist.",The Counselor
126,warthogjump,Great actors in terrible script,6,10 November 2013,"Unfortunately, ""The Counselor"" proves that you cannot out act a terrible script.Surprisingly, Cormac McCarthy, despite his previous great efforts, managed to write a horrendous script. The dialogue is appalling.The characters frequently talk about sex, money, drugs and women, conversation which would generally entertain me in most other drug trafficking films, but nevertheless, McCarthy somehow succeeded on boring me on some of the most interesting topics of dialogue. I am not sure why the dialogue is so bad, maybe because it is so unrealistic and unnecessarily complex or maybe it is because it is some kind of modern Shakespearean riddle through every scene or maybe more likely it is because it is a combination of both.The plot of the movie is alright, at best, but the lack of understanding by the viewer for the actions of each character, especially the Counselor, makes it very difficult for me to feel anything towards any of the characters.The actors do their best to save this film, especially Javier Bardem, who is in an acting class of his own, but the dialogue was so bad that there was no resurrecting this mess. Even for Cameron Diaz, who I could not even differentiate if her acting in this movie was just as bad as the script or if the script in fact concealed her acting capability. Diaz's lines were by far the worst and I don't think any actress could have made it slide half decent. Every single scene Diaz was in I just wanted to look away.If I want to go further, which I will, this is probably the biggest waste of Javier Bardem and Brad Pitt's acting talent. Both actors were given terrible roles and prevented from using even half their huge acting potential.I give the movie a 6/10 for some good, brutal killing scenes (thanks to Ridley Scott), a plot that had potential, but destroyed in the face of terrible dialogue and a list of fine actors doing their best, especially Javier Bardem who stepped out on a limb to save this mess.",The Counselor
127,rtp4242,The Counselor. Has No Appeal.,2,6 July 2014,"The Counselor (Michael Fassbender) is a lawyer who is deeply in love with Laura. (Penelope Cruz) He wants to marry Laura, and buys her a prohibitively expensive engagement ring, and seems to be set for a life filled with happiness. The Counselor inexplicably wants to become a part of the drug trade in Juarez Mexico. He meets with his friend Reiner, (Javier Bardem) and a middle man named Westray (Brad Pitt) and despite their warnings, the Counselor goes ahead with his plan to make 20 million dollars on a drug deal. When a drug courier is killed, and the drug shipment disappears, the kingpin, Jefe (Reuben Blades) goes after Laura. Does Laura survive? Who has the drug shipment?A movie with this kind of star power, directed by Ridley Scott should not be this appallingly bad. I blame the writer Cormac McCarthy, I've read The Road and seen the film, I saw No Country For Old Men, and now there's this movie, all three gave me a massive headache. McCarthy's writing style is enigmatic. There is no cohesive story, no central theme to build a story around. Is it a cautionary tale about drugs or money or is it an exciting drama about the drug war with sexual overtones? It tries to be both, it ends up being a muddled mess. The characters are spouting, flowery almost poetic language one minute, and spouting four letter words the next. Neither the flowery language or the sex talk or PG-13 sex scenes move the story along one iota, and only serves to confuse matters even further. McCarthy never answers the question why. Why does a lawyer, with a beautiful fiancé have a desire to join the drug trade? The characters aren't clearly drawn or delineated, and so the Counselor has great actors, a great director just begging for a good story.This is the first time I've seen Michael Fassbender and his acting wasn't compelling to me. Brad Pitt gives a dull, listless rendering of Westray the middle man. He has a very limited range of skills, limited to comedic action roles. Javier Bardem looks like a troll, I liked Bardem in Skyfall, his character was funny and a nice change of pace. But this is supposed to be a different movie in tone than Skyfall, and Bardem plays ostensibly the same character, and it doesn't work in this instance. Cameron Diaz and Penelope Cruz, who can be great actresses are used as little more than eye candy. The other Latinos, Blades, Rosie Perez, John Leguizamo are all stereotypically portrayed as criminals, and there is not one heroic character of any race in the entire film, just men with varying degrees of murderous avarice.The cinematography is stellar. El Paso Texas and Salt Lake City Utah look glorious doubling for Juarez Mexico, it's those opening shots the draw the viewer in, just as much the dialogue repels the viewer. It's a pity that a great visual director like Ridley Scott (Blade Runner, Alien) had to waste his time trying to breathe life into a lifeless script.

128,fxdx4,Leaves me unsatisfied,6,5 February 2014,"I remember when I out to dinner once and I made my own pasta. I saw all the delicious ingredients and poured them into my creation. The shrimp, the chicken, the peppers and the marinara sauce. It looked good, it smelled good, but you know when I went to taste it, for whatever reason it was 'blah'. Same goes with The Councilor. All those good ingredients are there. There is good acting all around (or almost all, sorry Diaz). The plot excites and I even like Scott's directing (although his last couple films were both major letdowns). But, at the end of the day I cannot say it is a good movie. It is just, 'blah'. The plot is simple; 'The Councilor' (interesting no name is ever given) is in love with a woman and getting into some pretty heavy illegal activity to make a quick buck (why, who can say). Things go bad (as they always do). Simple enough, except we never really know what activity he is getting involved in, we never really know what goes wrong, and we never really know what the role the ½ dozen major characters has to do with the plot. The acting is good. I always enjoy Pitt, and the rest do a solid job. Scott has each do a series of monologues that speak to the nature of man in one sense or another, yet these acting gems do little to add to the movie, feeling more like a film school project. Pitt waxes about the nature of friendship and Bardem recalls an anecdote from last night's club. But, if there is a message or point to these it is lost on all but the most profound audience. This feels like a movie that should have been done by the Coen Brothers, a cross between No Country for Old Men and Traffic. But the film lacks the presentation and humour of No Country, and the plot of Traffic, leaving a bit of a mess. It tries to be philosophical, but does not have much else to back it up. A shame really. Some might argue that is the beauty of this movie – that it truly does imitate life – it is random, unexplained, beautiful and ugly, confused and bored. Events happen, some have purpose, and some do not. I on the other hand need a movie a bit more grounded, exciting and logical.

130,botrytis,A Cult in Sight,7,29 January 2014,"With The Counselor"" we get an unusual concept, which centrum is not definitely the title character, and with that the whole storytelling is set in two directions: The world with The counselor and his accompanies' eyes and the real"" world's members' (kinda metaphorical sentence). The realistic mob world depicted here is in an exotic environment, which symbolisms are set into materialistic-ism, hence we get the picture about priorities of these people, but even the desires of theirs, which get them into dark corners of this real"" world.The story from the Counselor and his accompanies' view is normal, same as we would see the world from their place: naive, reachable opportunities which can be get by money, power, intelligence, 'friends'. The other view is from the mob's eyes: only the fittest survives, no rabbit should mess with the jaguar (it was jaguar in the movie, right?), and these 'newbies', un-experienced lifes are expendable. From these double standards we get the movie in two tastes: The dramatical, tragical and the materialistic, ""death is only a part of business"" ones. Furthermore with these mixing with each other the overall movie is  odd.But let's talk about the more objective part of this product; The visual is fancy, exotic, colorful, from the aspect that it's kinda realistic and set into real world. The actors present quite solid performances, which with the comprehension of the story is on solid basis. The soundtrack is one of the factor which represents the exotic"" environment, on the other hand it's pretty good. The story is the most difficult phase of this motion picture, because it's language is like a woman's: it's always around the bush"" so it's kinda with many secrets and no points in sight. Many people in the audience may be frightened about the movie's unusual structure, but it shouldn't scare anyone, because it's purpose must be understood first and then being judged, however many do in the other way. So as far as I can see, this motion picture has a classy presentation BUT with an unusual storytelling, which gives us some refreshing moments yet as a whole may be misunderstand-able, therefore leaves more disappointment then enjoyment for many people.

131,HaveWisdomWillTravel,Another Piece of Cormac McCarthy Narcissistic Vomit,1,24 February 2014,"My mistake. I didn't check who wrote it before buying the ticket: Cormac McCarthy. All I saw...Ridley Scott, Michael Fassbender, Penelope...what could go wrong? I hated Cormac's No Country for Old Man which left me with rage and nausea lasted many days after. To me that was the lowest point for Coen Brothers. Ridley Scott's turn to be seduced by literary sort it seems. But I forgive Ridley - simply because he lost his brother during the making of this film. Cormac took over the casting directing and editing and left his trademark hate-filled brain and bowel matter all over this tedious, banal, plot less, meaningless, anti-intellect, anti-human, anti- soul, hostile, rotted-corpse-gore-fest piece of trash. The non-story features bland flatly-drawn Fassbender panicking around being lectured at by former mafia insiders who give long boring sermons more tedious than Ayn Rand monologues; a compromising Cameraon Diaz wiping dirt off her bf's car windscreen with her supposedly shaved and fish-like labia; talented Leguizamo wasted and paired with rotting stinking human corpse marinating in Mexican metal drums; beautiful Brad Pitt's body parts being torn apart in sadistic slo-mo and blood projectiles splattering all over pristine modern city streets... Penelope's corpse rolling down unceremoniously off nameless garbage dump... ... Ended with...a final scene presenting - TADA - Cormac's ultimate moral authority:Queen Goddess Cheetah Diaz all perky and botoxed ushered into posh trendy restaurant, then as usual out of nowhere and unsolicited, in ridiculously long sentence structure INFORMED her very attentive financial adviser, that she gets female boners from watching animals hunting and killing animals. We have been INFORMED that we are supposed to be simultaneously turned on and terrified by her really scary self-declaration. YAWN.And that's how Cormac write ""stories"". Informing us of his amazing bowel content.The audience has spoken. Even the most dishonest and pretentious critic cannot excuse this turd from box office dumpster. Sorry, even cheap and grotesque image of Cheetah Diaz's windscreen wiping genitalia will not save the bottom-line, nor turn this Cormac mental vomit into a script. Lesson to Hollywood: let an over-rated literary novelist run your show, let him play casting director and plot the show, expect great losses.And what's wrong with these brand name actors - they can't tell a good script from a dead rotten pile of word salad? All Hollywood screenwriters decamped to the Moon? Brat Pitt wants to throw his years of hard work of credibility away for this?They couldn't tell that there isn't a narrative but a string of Cormac's hard-hitting ""big"" statements???""HELLO!!! Cameron Diaz type is not human but a merciless man-eating CHEETAH on the prowl! CHEEEETAAHHH Diaz is SO BADDDD she wipes her boyfriend's sports car windscreen with her hairless eel of an amazing female GENITALLL!""""LISTEN!!! Penelope is the ultimate sweet sexy kitten every men dream of waking up to but in cynical hate-filled Cormac world, queen Cheetah Diaz is da winner! Sweet kitty Penelope just want romance, so she deserves to DIE! Why? Cute innocent kitties shouldn't date lawyers!?""Cormac kept repeating (apparently non-cliché) statements of...""THOU SHALT NOT PLAY DICE WITH MAFIAS! WE KILL PEOPLE LIKE THEY'RE MERE ANIMALS YOU KNOW!?"" in convoluted half-ass philosophical-sounding long paragraph-length sentences..Cormac's real fixation is however more mundane:""HEY GUYS LIKE ALL OF YOU I LUST AFTER ALPHA CHEETAH QUEEN'S PRIVATE BUT I FEAR SHE WILL EAT ME FOR DESSERT OH NO!!! KEEP HER AT BAY!!! KEEP HER ALPHA GENITAL BEHIND WINDSCREEN! JUST WATCH AT A DISTANCE!! IT'S SAFER!""But Cormac remains a hypocrite - even as he deifies his Alpha-female-bodypart, he very specifically degrades her organ as an inefficient car cleaning device and unglamorous mud- dwelling bottom-feeding fish. This movie is a grand sadistic outburst of Cormac's female-organ-envy. That's all. Sad. Soulless. Creature..Not sure I hate this movie more or Melancholia, which is saying A LOT.

132,fullheadofsteam,"Perhaps too intellectually-driven for most audiences, but worth a watch",7,19 March 2016,"I rated this film a 7 for the following reasons: Excellent acting by all, Ridley Scott at the helm, and dour, dismal reality as rendered by writer Cormac McCarthy. Now the proviso: you must pay close attention to every nuance and detail, and even then you might have trouble piecing it all together. This is a bleak film to be sure, about an American attorney who enters into a business enterprise intending to fund his capital investment with his share of profits from a Mexican drug cartel smuggled shipment to Chicago. The overbearing and fundamental message is that the attorney did in fact know better than to engage in such nefarious illegal activity. When things go south, as they say, meaning that all does not go according to plan, well the Mexican Cartel hammer drops. Engaging and dismal (as intended by McCarthy) as this film is, it is far too complex in dialogue for the average film goer, and this detracts from a more cohesive story line. The dialogue is probably also far too cerebral to be believable among drug-running criminals. All this aside, if you can indeed pay close attention to detail, this film is rewarding in showing us the truest evil of the Mexican drug cartel and, even worse, those who would try to rip it off for profit by manipulating and throwing others to the proverbial slaughter of the wolves.",The Counselor
133,johnklem,8 for ambition and 4 for results = 6,6,7 February 2015,"The Counselor could have been one of my all-time favorite flicks. I've watched it twice and I'll see it again before I die. I'd rather watch a single ambitious failure than a dozen safe successes and this is a hugely ambitious failure. What draws me back time and again is the challenge of understanding why it doesn't work. The cast is stellar and the script crackles with taut, witty dialog and some thought-provoking philosophy. There are even some very funny jokes. Why wasn't Jesus born in Mexico? You'll have to watch the movie for the answer. The photography is gorgeous, the south west locations unusual and that wonderful French confection, the mise en scene, on the face of it perfect. After two viewings, I'm beginning to understand the problem. There's an odd lack of energy. That's always a danger with an ensemble piece or a story that's centered on an everyman and Ridley Scott's been down that road once before. Kingdom of Heaven had the same issues and it's instructive that the director's cut was ultimately the much better version. So, here we have another ensemble piece built around an everyman. Instead of Orlando Bloom, we have Michael Fassbender but here Fassbender, whose acting credentials are pretty damn good, is oddly uninvolving. Of course, his performance is authentic, restrained and everything you'd expect from an actor of his calibre. But he's shallow. Right there, we get to the heart of the problem. He is shallow. He is an everyman, caught up in a nightmare created by his own weakness. But we never learn the root of that weakness, why he needs the deal so badly and that's what's missing from The Counselor. It's like watching an accident that happened years ago to people you never knew. The rest of the cast? Everyone delivers. Badem hams it up shamelessly, Cruz is as good as always, Ganz has the best cameo, Pitt proves yet again that he's a far better supporting actor than starring and Perez is perfect. The oddity here is Cameron Diaz. She's not miscast as other reviewers have argued. She's actually spot on. The beautiful, smart survivor who's reaching her sell-by date as a rich man's toy and knows it. That it isn't a wholely successful performance is not, I think, her fault. She has perhaps the meatiest and most nuanced role as the real architect of Fassbender's downfall but the script doesn't give her the material to explore her character to the full. This is a flawed film, part thriller, part tragedy, part comedy and part shaggy-dog story. I will watch it again.",The Counselor

135,tom-456,Lots of style but zero substance,1,19 June 2017,"In Mexico, lawyer-man decides to dabble in the drug trade, and is strongly advised not to, by the two men who are his connections to the drug trade. Some stuff subsequently happens involving drugs, but it is damned near impossible to figure out any connection to lawyer-man's two drug connections, and nothing whatsoever is ever revealed about what lawyer-man did for them. Lawyer-man visits character played by Rosie Perez, in prison. She tells him that her kid is in jail, for speeding. The scene cuts quickly to a motorcyclist riding very fast along a desolate road, so we can infer that this is her son. A truck hauling septic waste pulls into a small lot. A man steps out and then removes an electronic immobilizer from the back of the cab, which he gives to another man in exchange for cash. This man meets up with the young man who rides the fast bike and delivers the device to him. They are watched by another man and woman in a car some distance away. Via cell phone, the man watching talks to a woman who we soon learn is the girlfriend of lawyer-man's #1 drug contact. The young man who rides the fast motorcycle is soon killed, and the device is taken. The truck is subsequently taken, from the yard at the small septic company's facility. Out on the highway in the middle of nowhere, they are pulled over by two phony policeman. After a bloody shootout, the sole survivor, one of the phony policeman, is now in possession of the septic truck. Both of lawyer-man's drug contacts inform him that he is in serious trouble, but he hasn't a clue why, and neither do we, because we have not been told a single thing about exactly what his involvement with the drug people was. We literally have no clue. Lawyer-man's #1 drug contact (the one with the girlfriend) is killed. The other one escapes, via airport jet. Lawyer-man panics, calls his fiancée and gives her instructions where to meet him. She gets taken at the airport. Lawyer-man's surviving drug contact arrives in Heathrow, goes to hotel, and at the desk has an apparently chance encounter with a strange woman. This woman later meets with the girlfriend of lawyer-man's #1 drug connection, and hands over, in exchange for an envelope filled with cash, a piece of paper with a password. On the street, lawyer-man's #2 drug contact is quickly killed by joggers who take his briefcase and deliver it to the girlfriend of #1, waiting in a car. She opens it, inserts a thumb drive into the small laptop computer, logs in, and up pop a couple windows for banks in the Caribbean. Lawyer-man lays on the floor of some grungy apartment somewhere and is awakened by a knock at the door. He opens the door and finds a small boy who is delivering an envelope. He opens the envelope and finds a DVD, then gets sick and drops it on the floor, without watching it, and sobs. His fiancee's body is then shown being dropped by a bulldozer into a large landfill / garbage dump, and buried under a large amount of garbage. Too bad we never learned exactly what lawyer-man had done to have deserved all this. Apparently, the screen-writer felt that it was sufficient for the viewer to know that lawyer-man did some unethical/illegal lawyering for some bad people who stole from some other bad people and who were in turn robbed by one of their own. But even this much was difficult to figure out, and there were a great many obvious questions that were never answered. This movie is not worth watching.

136,Stewball,A new level of sinister,10,26 October 2013,"By the time it's over you realize this is more blood curdling and wicked than any horror tale. But it sneaks up on you. It's like ""Savages"", ""Blow"" and ""Traffic"" all rolled into one that reaches out and punches you in the throat with the scope and depth of the cold blooded darkness it portrays. It disarms you from the beginning with the extensive normality in it's engaging dialogue, it's interesting characters and even humor, especially one scene involving a Ferrari. But even knowing this I doubt anyone would be prepared for where it takes them, unless they come from this world. Written by Cormac McCarthy, it's very similar in tone to his best known work, ""No Country for Old Men"".I know some will disagree (well, many already have with the lukewarm ratings and disappointing box office it's getting--the R ratings crowd apparently opting for MTV's ""Bad Grandpa"", sigh), but I think this is Ridley Scott's best since ""Gladiator"". The cast is superb, especially Diaz and Bardem; and I gotta plug Natalie Dormer whose character has a small part but makes a tremendous gesture that sets her above the otherwise maleficent current to the story. I'm definitely going to have to watch this again.It's probably over-the-top irony, but think Glen Frey's ""Smuggler's Blues"" when the credits roll.(Edit:) I'm bumping it up from 9 to a 10/10...a masterpiece.

137,graupepillard,What happens when you leave your comfort zone and go into a pit of vipers,4,31 December 2013,"I was not going to review director Ridley Scott's new movie THE COUNSELOR, because of my aversion to Pulitzer Prize winner Cormac McCarthy's pretentious dialogue in this, his screen writing debut. But I changed my mind because I yearned to write a ""cautionary"" review. I listened to what was fumblingly coming out of the mouths of actors I respected in this ""morality"" tale and felt patronized. Short pithy philosophical thoughts were floating from their tongues, hovering in the air lifeless before falling ineffectively to the ground.The film opens with the lovely Penelope Cruz under tousled white sheets making love to Michael Fassbender – the Counselor – who is never called by any other name. The erotically charged love scene quickly collapses under the weight of their asinine conversation, a forecast of what I will have to sit through for the next 2+ hours. Next the camera quickly cuts to the ""dark"" side of Mexico, where high-stakes drug deals are under way, and then we jump to Amsterdam, Columbia, Chicago, and continue hurtling back and forth to various sites on the Tex-Mex border.Our Counselor – a avaricious newbie at the drug game - is about to do a deal with some ""bad"" boys –a strange Javier Bardem with an even more bizarre hairdo, and Brad Pitt, a mysterious man who is at ease with the under-world and seems to smoothly snake his way through it, unscathed and a step ahead of calamity. For me the star of this den of reptiles is Cameron Diaz who I found fascinating as the cold, shrewd, wildly evil and often mesmerizing mistress of Bardem, Diaz, is often guarded by two muscular and sleek Cheetahs (who are tamer than their master,) appreciatively observing them hunt innocent prey. She is the best part of this movie –a carnal and hard beauty with tattoos of Big Cats' paw-prints adorning her body.Suffice it to say the deal goes bad and the Counselor is in a dangerous dilemma. Having been apprised by his ""partners"" (part of the metaphysical drivel) as to the capriciousness of doing business where there are no guarantees – all of the warnings come to fruition. What I found most ineffectual about THE COUNSELOR was the attempt by Scott and McCarthy to make a weak character the archetype for greed and arrogance in a ""game"" against seasoned predators. I did not care about The Counselor at all – he was whiny, vain and as shallow and lightweight as the stream of conversations we the audience had to endure.",The Counselor

It's a first-class film with extraordinary characters and great filmmaking skill.

If you want to see expensive stuff and lots of close ups of beautiful actors talking in code then this is the film for you. If you want a thriller about getting mixed up with the drug cartel you will be lost throughout most of the movie. Not sure what the director's vision was here, was he looking for film festival awards or what? For example, the huge drug shipment is stolen, but then recovered, so why do they go around killing everyone anyway? It isn't even explained how the lawyer is actually involved in the drug shipment, just that he is. Nothing is really explained at all.

140,dndcullens,Wow,10,17 May 2014,"Apparently I am one of the few who came into this movie with no pre- conceived ideas of what it would actually be like. I saw it and got it as it was directed by Ridley Scott, written by a great author and had a decent cast list. I never saw any trailers or reviews and just had the briefest of description of the story. I'll tell ya, its the only way to go. On the other hand this can also backfire with some movies....a lot of movies...so it is not worth pursuing but for this particular movie it was one of the real pleasures of movie watching. The film is one of the best I have seen for a long, long, time. From the direction, to the story (Holy man what a script, absolutely brilliant) to the superb acting all round, it had everything...and in buckets. As an example each of the main characters gets a chance to make a speech and all do well (my favourite being Bruno Ganz's)and if people were left totally bemused by the film after watching the trailer then you need to stop watching trailers. I have not watched any for this and probably for the better. As for the points about the plot going nowhere are the story being disjointed I would say to these people ...... stop watching trailers! Everything is very well explained by the Mexican drug barron near the end and funnily enough probably at the beginning by Javier Bardem. If you want a movie about drug violence and explosions and murders and the rest there are plenty out there. This is sooo not the movie for you. Just to sum up this is a brilliant movie and worth seeing on the fly. All the actors give probably one of their best performances in their roles and Scott's direction is fantastic as always. But where the movie really stands out (and really how movies should be first judged) is in the script. Highly recommended. 10/10",The Counselor
141,nuhc,"Confusing mess of a movie, poorly written with dumb dialog",3,8 November 2013,"My wife and I decided to see this movie since nothing else in the theater looked good. Other than a brief synopsis on the movie theater website, I didn't know anything about this movie. But it looked intriguing with a great cast.Looks can be deceiving, and that was certainly the case here. What looked like it should be a good movie turned out to be a confusing film that goes everywhere, yet nowhere. All the dialog between characters was filled with language which apparently was supposed to be deeply profound and philosophical, but came off as either confusing or silly. People just don't talk like that in real life.The other problem with the movie was the fact that very little is explained. We don't know why the Counselor (couldn't they give the main character a name?) wants to get involved in a drug deal, especially since he's rich enough to drive a sports car and fly off to Amsterdam to buy a 3.8 carat diamond for his girlfriend's wedding ring, but it's revealed later (as much as anything in this movie is revealed) that he got into the deal for money. Of course, we are not told what his involvement in the deal is, nor anyone else's.In the middle of all this heavy dialog between characters, we're shown scenes of a truck full of drugs coming into the country. A truck which gets stolen and therefore the drug cartel thinks the Counselor and everyone he knows is responsible. So therefore the movie turns into an effort for each of the main characters to survive, yet all but one seem unconcerned that they might be killed by the cartel members.This is just where the movie starts to get interesting, yet there are so many continuity errors and plot holes that the movie which was confusing before just becomes silly. Are we really to believe that Westray, who said that he could disappear and not be found, would be tracked to London and then hook up with a beautiful woman from New Mexico (when all the previous action took place around El Paso) and would allow her to steal the password to his computer? I knew she was a plant when he met her at the hotel desk. Are we to believe that instead of driving around with a couple of bodyguards when a drug cartel is after him, a drug dealer is just going to drive around alone with a gun in the glove box? Are we also to believe that the Counselor, after throwing his cell phone away so he wouldn't be tracked, would apparently just run down to the Verizon shop and get another phone? Are we also to believe that instead of going into hiding, he goes down to Juarez to talk to (I'm guessing, that character is never explained) a drug kingpin who instead of just telling him that he's screwed, goes into some pseudo-intellectual philosophical soliloquy? And after talking to this guy, instead of leaving and going into hiding somewhere he just walks around the streets and falls asleep in a restaurant? Are we to believe that Cameron Diaz's character is from Barbados? Why do we even need to keep following the subplot about the truck after the drug cartel goes after the main characters? It's like that part was kept in to fill time and provide some more gruesome on screen bloodshed. And Brad Pitt's character wasn't even really needed in the movie.After seeing this movie I understand that a well-known novelist decided to write a movie script, and this movie is the result. That explains the improbable, convoluted dialog between characters, so much missing from the plot, and why character development was lacking. Best to leave novels to the novelists and leave screenplays to the movie writers.The movie wasn't totally bad, since there were a couple of scenes of people getting killed in interesting ways and a funny sex scene involving a woman and a car windshield. But the confusing plot, lack of development, and ponderous dialog make this movie hard to watch. And the ending is a total letdown. This is a movie I don't really care to see again.",The Counselor

A film which boasts a blockbuster cast with a legendary director, is not only disappointing but it is actually horrendous. In fact this film is almost a wonder in itself given all the positive ingredients, it served up a dis-tasteful, bland and shockingly nauseous dish of utter garbage. The writing was on the wall from the opening scene, with Michael Fassbender who was pathetic throughout, sharing an almost pornographic scene with the cheap under-used Penelope Cruz. Their was occasional style in some of the scenes but as the movie became more and more disjointed and boring, even the style dried up. Full marks to Cameron Diaz who had the only worthwhile role in this hapless movie with a nice cameo from Brad Pitt. I surely hope the novel by Cormac McCarthy was better than this laughable, crude and confusing adaptation of a plot so dull and dreary that even it's overdue climax left no impression.

147,BrentHankins,Drowns under the weight of cryptic dialogue and abstract storytelling.,4,24 October 2013,"With three of his novels being adapted into critically acclaimed films, Cormac McCarthy has opted to try his hand at screen writing, and the fruits of his labor can be seen in The Counselor. Directed by Ridley Scott, the film stars Michael Fassbender as a high-priced lawyer who decides to dabble in something a bit less than legal in order to make some extra cash.Against the advice of associates Reiner (Javier Bardem) and Westray (Brad Pitt), The Counselor (whose name is never mentioned) has somehow gotten himself involved in the drug trafficking business, although the film remains ambiguous about the specifics. Motivated by the love of a beautiful woman (Penelope Cruz) and the desire to maintain the lifestyle he's enjoyed for so long, he never takes into account the sort of consequences he may be subjected to, should things not go according to plan.As the trailers for the film make abundantly clear, things do not, in fact, go according to plan - at least, that's what we're led to believe, since the details of The Counselor's involvement in said plan are never actually revealed. Despite being warned about this scenario from the very beginning, by nearly every other character in the film, The Counselor remains inexplicably shocked and stunned when things begin to unravel.Ridley Scott's latest directorial effort is peppered with lengthy scenes that find The Counselor engaged in conversations with other characters as they try to impart kernels of wisdom, truth and philosophy. Unfortunately, first-time screenwriter McCarthy fails to realize that he's not writing a novel here. Despite the brilliance of his literary works, he doesn't take into account the fact that living, breathing people rarely speak in monologues, and there's scarcely an ounce of naturally delivered dialogue in any of these exchanges.Indeed, if you watch closely you can actually see the actors struggling to wrap their heads (and mouths) around these complex conversations that are surely meant to sound intelligent, but come across as anything but. It's hard to find fault with the talented cast, but when working with such messy material, it's difficult to be at the top of your game.Despite the script's shortcomings, The Counselor provides enough intrigue to keep things moving along for about 90 minutes or so. The problem, of course, is that the film grinds to a complete and utter halt with another half hour still left in the tank, and the final 30 minutes is some of the most excruciatingly boring cinema I've seen this year.

But this is quite a muddle of a film, and one that must have lost something considerable in the translation from page to screen. Set in New Mexico, the aloof plot of The Counsellor concerns a drug deal gone wrong and the consequences of the actions which led to that. There's few what's, why's or wherefores, with little exposition as we're introduced to a world of shady characters who surround Michael Fassbender's counsellor. Those include Javier Bardem's ostentatious gangster, his predatory moll, played by Cameron Diaz and Brad Pitt as an underworld trader/dealer of sorts. Nothing here is actually made clear, including the reason any character does just about anything in the film. Which is by design, of course, especially with this leaning more towards character study than narrative. But with no hook and nothing to hang on to, The Counsellor becomes an increasingly protracted and pointless film. And it's not as though the direction is poor or that the performances are bad, simply that the themes of the film undermines the entire movie. Whilst, some truly risible dialogue and glaring plot-points only serve to hammer home an exercise in the banal. File this under ""could do better!""",The Counselor
152,jericw16,It's 2019 and I Just Watched The Counselor,10,11 February 2019,"A very dark and heavy movie, that is something of it's own. Something that many movies haven't been able to do recently and this should be applauded. Go in knowing that this was written by Cormac McCarthy, his very first screenplay. It's very abstract, lots of metaphors, and dialogue that may seem unimportant and it may be, but that's subjective. The cinematography, acting, score, and editing are all top of their class.Spoiler Time: Fassbenders character is very reflective and remembers conversations that possibly the audience forgot, so much so to a fault, it cripples him in one scene. He receives a burned DVD titled Hola! and based on the story that Bardem's character told him, he believes it's a snuff film of his missing Wife.A very tough movie to swallow, it does not play safe anywhere. And that's something most movies won't do.",The Counselor
153,ArtandJoyofMovies,Movie is pure trash,1,5 November 2013,"While Brad Pitt proves he can act marvelously in his sleep, he is the only redeeming quality in this otherwise worthless piece of trash film. The only purpose of the film I could come up with was a medium for Cameron Diaz to once again prove she is the sluttiest woman in Hollywood. Job well done.This film starts out contorted and totally disjointed. It makes no sense in the beginning, the middle or the end. The opening scene is totally ridiculous and only explained by Michael Fassbender paying off writer Cormac McCarthy big time. I guess it just foreshadowed we were all going to be going down big time before the movie was over.Director Ridley Scott obviously forgot to lay off the cocaine while directing. I cannot even imagine what the plot or storyline was supposed to be. There is no likable character. There are no laughs. There is no suspense. You just get plenty of sweaty Mexicans and gore. The message? Lay off drugs whether practicing law or directing a film.What is really weird is this film was billed as a ""thriller."" The only ""thrills"" were the action between Penelope Cruz' legs and Cameron Diaz and the windshield of a sports car. But frankly, the way Diaz pulled it off and the way Bardem later described the encounter might make any straight guy consider going gay.Everyone in my theater got up and shook their head or wanted their money back.

It's unfortunate because in an interview with Scott, he stated that he just wants the audience to be entertained. The film basically depicts and restates over and over again how the our world is a dark, corrupt, unpredictable, and lonely place. WOW...gee, what else is new? It's fine to reflect the world we live in, but don't leave me hanging in the end with no sense of hope or encouragement.

Several scenes of dialogue rivals Robert Shaw's Indianapolis speech in Jaws. Technically amazing and a fantastic reality of the drug trade, corruption, violence, power and greed.

Why did he agree to get involved in this drug deal? The movie told us almost nothing about this, either before or after he agreed to do it. It had to do with money, and that's about all we know. Attorneys are famously cautious. When and why exactly did this one stop being cautious? No clue. For that matter, why and how did he end up being appointed to defend Rosie Perez's character? He definitely didn't seem to have the demeanor of a criminal defense lawyer, so that one needed a little explanation.In summary, it seems like this would've done better as a three-part six- hour miniseries.

And how do I know this? Well, because there is no story. Simple! You have a very good camera, a very capable director and a bunch of superb actors like Brad Pitt, who in my opinion steals the show. By the way, I thought Cameron Diaz did her part very well in spite of some negative criticism shown here on IMDb. But that's it people. That is all you gonna get, glued by the most crappy-pseudo-intellectual dialogs you can imagine. A plot? Really, was there a plot? Sorry, if there was one it just passed unnoticed. You never understand what's going on, what and why things go wrong, who the people involved come from, what they do, whom they work for. Actors just slide in and out of scene after firing their mystic s*** while you keep on watching in disbelief. Oh, and there are the cats, those stupid cheetahs, making constantly misplaced appearances on the screen. The only good thing about them was they could not talk.

Cartel is the story of a rich advocate who think it's no big deal to grab more money on dealing with a drug cartel to make his own life a bit spicy and gives the best he can to his beautiful wife in a kind of superficial heaven.M. Fassbender (the Councelor) is great as a naive guy who can't or doesn't want to believe J. Bardem (Reiner) and B. Pitt (Westray), his two associates in crime, when they told him, the Cartel won't joke and kill everybody involved if something goes wrong.......

The histories of every character are non-existent, Cameron Diaz is an orphan and we can believe that she used more than her body to come there, Brad Pitt comes from Texas with boots and hat, always leaving for a deal which pays well, but is rather of the dangerous kind and Javier Bardem is an eccentric businessman, if there is no interest in to know more about it, the story is slow to be set up.the best part is when Rubèn Blades is explaining how the life works in their world, literally, to M.

An everyday man wants more Money and turns to the wrong people. What Movies, today, are truly original? not many. when making Movies today and especially in this genre/storyline you must tread carefully and try to create interesting characters and get the right actors and a interesting and detailed surrounding. And this is exactly what the creators have done.Brad Pitt is outstanding although in a minor role, Fassbender delivers a solid performance as usual, all topped with great actors in small parts, Bruno Ganz (der untergang) as a Diamond dealer in Amsterdam and John Leguizamo (Land of the Dead) as a smalltime crook in Chicago for example.The Movie is filled with Matrix-style semi philosophy Worth pondering on and great and colorful dialog.On the downside is the unoriginal plot and the somewhat predictable tying-up the loose ends part and the ending of the characters. BUT, listen up folks: do not take the critique of the dialog seriously, it is magnificent and is not at all slowing down the pacing of the Movie. However, if you are dead serious about formula one tempo in a Movie...sure, you might find the Counselor somewhat slow, but NOT intimidating or negative at all.I give it 8 out of 10.

Even worse, I have viewed the Director's Cut only, or in other words the improved version he would like us to see.The good news, this is a very pretty, stylish and well edited movie. Great photography of things like sunsets and big cats. but, as Brad Pitt might add at the end, don't lose your head yet. The bad news, where do I begin? How about this: scene after boring scene where characters go on and on and on...yet say in every three sentences what they could have said in one. There must be a formula here, take the minutes of each scene, divide by three and...oh, my...not good news. In addition, much of the dialog is spoken in such a flat and odd cadence that at times it appears the actors are reading from TelePrompTers.There is a great deal of philosophy offered in the wordy scenes, kind of like what you might expect in a good Kung Fu movie. Huge life lesson stuff, if you know what I mean, where the obvious is overstated and then there are 'gee whiz' moments of silence allowed so that we viewers can ponder the essence of who-knows-what. I am afraid I never got into it, much like those characters speaking line after line in mechanical earnest, like robots issuing instructions for life.The Director's Cut opens with a scene that is tedious, unnerving and too long. I have read in other reviews that this version has 'extended' scenes that are intended to improve the final product. Don't be fooled as I was. Scene one is just an entrée to a movie with scene after scene where the key players talk too much without effectively advancing something worthy of Mr. Scott's reputation. I kept watching and hoping but it never got any better.Oh, well, it is prettyCasting is a real problem. There is no 'lead' actor present in the movie. Yes, the titular character is Mr. Fassbender, but his role never rises to a 'lead' position. Ridley never allows that to happen. Penelope is just window dressing and Javier is as bombastic and quirky as ever, but we all know he will never rise above a super-character actor slot. And, Brad? Well, he is there but don't lose your head expecting him to rise above his supporting role. Then, there is Ms. Diaz. Her role could have been filled by one of several actresses available. A better choice might have been Gong Li, Julia Roberts or one of your recently middle-aged cousins. Instead, Cam got the part and walks through it like someone in a narcolepsy study.The cast is like a football team without a quarterback, so to speak. Before release I read about the 'powerhouse, dream cast'. Add a lead to the mix, take away the teleprompter and recast Fassbender and Diaz and I might agree.One might think that the wordy scenes and overbearing dialog would at least paint a very clear picture of what is going on in the movie - OK think again. Transition periods from scene to scene are sometimes 'fill in the blank' for viewers, as the movie progresses. Better take notes if you can, that could really help.",The Counselor
167,alexdelliott,Solid thriller that would've made an excellent book,7,6 June 2014,"Remember the 90's? That was a fantastic decade for neo noir thrillers such as the usual suspects and seven. It saddens me now that the label of thriller is usually given to films such as Taken which involve high speed chases, gunfights, fist fights and explosions. This film reminds me of those brilliant 90's thrillers with its slow burning character focus and I am happy to see Hollywood take risks and deviate from their tried and tested formula. On that basis I certainly recommend picking up this film.The story is simple, involving a lawyer becoming involved in a drug smuggling operation when things go wrong and he finds himself in way over his head. We've seen it before. But this film distinguishes itself by focusing on the characters rather than the story. Fassbender plays the role perfectly as the arrogant lawyer who gradually finds his spirits crushed and his perfect life crumbling around him. Along the way he meets some very interesting characters and I have to tip my hat to Brad Pitt who plays the pragmatic middleman in the drugs business. He is cool and intelligent and it comes off with such charm. However the main theme of the film is choice and consequence. We've all been there, made a seemingly harmless choice for selfish reasons which backfires in a way we could not anticipate, leading to consequences far beyond our control. This theme is played out in a mature and very tense way. There is very little action so don't see it looking for shooting and high speed chases, there are so many films I could recommend for that. But this is pretty unique by today's standards.The film isn't without its flaws which seem to mainly come from the writing. McCarthy wrote the film as if it were straight from one of his novels with philosophical dialogues which speak to the audience and heavy symbolism. In a book, this writing would have made this an instant classic but unfortunately it comes off as rather pretentious, lacking in subtlety. Due to its rather unnatural flow, it becomes clear at times that the actors are struggling with it at times.Overall, this film is good. It is a dark and somewhat powerful look into the theme of choice and consequence, grief, death and hopelessness. There are many people on this site who really hate the film and I understand that given the writing. But I urge you to watch it and judge for yourself as it is a thought provoking and solid film that certainly deserves the label of thriller.",The Counselor

The film was all talk (and boring talk) with no real plot. Don't they review what they've shot and realize they are making a true piece of garbage? I guess they figure they can market anything as long as well known names are involved. I guess it has become very difficult to tell a compelling story.

169,micz81,Why it's the most underappreciated movie of the decade?,8,18 November 2020,"The marketing should be blamed here. For misleading poster which is just indifferent, and those typical thriller-like trailers. That kind of promotion does not deliver a single message about the real tone of that movie, about it's theme. Instead, my thoughts were guided into realm already well established in my head - thriller/action/tension expectations.But 'The Counselor' is not a thriller in the way we are accustomed to. It's rather an allegory dressed up as a thriller. But firstly I was also disappointed - the lack of action and the bizarre, hard to follow plot made me regret the screening. I hated the movie. I felt my evening was lost by this nonsense, absurd, chaotic hoax with no thriller-like vibe at all.But somehow I couldn't forget about this movie. Why? If it is so bad, why do I recall some scenes, mood, individual shots, dialogues? Why I'm still 'held' by this film, even so long after the premiere?And I think I got it. That's why I decided to write the review.That movie speaks kind of its own language. You have to be prepared to focus on characters, their stories, their vibe and the heat slowly rising without apparent reason. The plot is almost irrelevant - the 'thrills' come from observing complexity of human behaviours instead. The dirty money/cartels context is just an excuse, just a McGuffin, just a vessel for the tension coming out from character's choices and hearts. You can just feel those circumstances surrounding characters, not understand them perfectly and that's enough to be able to tell yourself who are you observing right now - the Thief, the Wise Man, the Pure Beauty, the Devil, the Jester. All of those almost mythological characters are drowning in the big pool of evil and greed. Their choices vary - from adding the dark water to the pool by mistake or deliberately, desperately pouring it out, just having fun in it, or panicking, etc.That movie is great not in genre-specific categories. It is great because of using those well known formulas to tell not a story, but rather ...a truth. The story gives you, the viewer only a chance to observe. Of course, you can tell that about almost all of the movies out there. But this one is a bit different - it changes the balance in favor of the observation of characters' attitudes, leaving the story in the role of very shady, but not particularly important context of pond of evil. You can observe how people react to this evil. How evil is born, and raised in them, how it is avoided or how it can't, how it's used for cruel hedonistic fun or to fuel the ego, how you can treat it strictly as a work environment. You can feel Cormac McCarthy's philosophical and a bit theatrical approach - dialogues are written boldly in rich, sophisticated language, mysterious tone and with elegant rhythm. And the director and actors seem to exactly know why. I feel they trusted the script and are somehow humble before it. Cormac McCarthy therefore seems to direct this movie from the back seat. And I like it.I highly recommend this title to all of you who seek something different and mature, told with style and respect for subtle nuances of human soul. It's hard to forget this lesson.",The Counselor

And the main cast pull something together here that is unique and edgy. It's dark, it builds up to a climatic ending and it also leaves you wondering. As a Ridley Scott film it certainly has a bit of everything. I think if you allow yourself to be fully immersed in the story, you'll enjoy the film. It's like you're sitting there participating in every conversation that takes place. You're an observer of the underworld and underhand activities that unfold. And that's great directing.

Unfortunately, the trailer was much better than the actual movie.The Counselor was about a successful attorney who becomes newly engaged, gets greedy, and decides to engage in the drug trafficking business, which predictably leads to his downfall.There were so many different angles and characters in this movie, that it was hard to keep track of the direction of this movie.Cameron Diaz gives an honest effort as the sleazy girlfriend, and she actually plays that part to a tee, as in one scene she humps the windshield of a vehicle(don't ask).Some of the scenes didn't make sense. In one scene a guy spends hours in configuring a wire across a roadway where he was plotting to kill a smuggler on a motorcycle. I guess the audience is supposed to assume that no one- and I mean no-one, uses that roadway for a good portion of the day.The same could be said about some of the characters in the movie.

173,orangehenryviii,Brilliant film perhaps cuts a little too close for some,8,3 February 2014,"I don't think it would be going out on a limb to call Ridley Scott one of our greatest directors, no serious movie fan would deny that of the man who brought us Blade Runner and Alien, and this Cormac McCarthy penned film is a bold new step for him; but obviously, seeing the many hateful reviews, a great many film-goers found this one quite unpalatable. The cast is impressive, no B-List-ers here; these are Hollywood's big guns and they are blazing. The production is seamless and the cinematography lush and glossy with some unforgettable imagery. Love it or hate it, you won't walk away from this one without it following you around for a while. Perhaps this is what provoked such polarized hostility, but I think it may be something more: the flashes of ugliness and violence depict what is an everyday reality in Mexico, something we don't like to think about in America; specifically that our fun-lovin' casual drug use is the intrinsic cause of untold suffering of our neighbors south of the border. I can only speculate that this was Scott and McCarthy's intent. There are no good guys presented here, just a slippery slope of human greed, predation, and strife. Our protagonist, the eponymous 'Counselor' (Michael Fassbender), soon finds himself a pawn in an unwinnable chess game of underworld machinations. In other words, this is perfect film noir fare, and it scrapes the grimy underbelly of our psyche deeply enough to sting a little, but like a good medicine, it only stings because there is a wound there, one neglected long enough to fester.

It's mediocre and predictable. It's your standard underworld criminal movie with a few eccentric characters, a lot of wealth thrown around and a central criminal plot. As things progress you kind of expect some action or something to kind of happen but it's really just standard story line that takes you pretty much where you would actually end up given the circumstances. By the end of it, and really through it all you don't really find yourself caring for or even wanting to care for any of the characters or feel much sympathy for them. There is little violence in this movie, which works for me since I'm not a fan of violence but my guessing is that most people who are into this genre loot forward to a few grizzly scenes now and then, and you really won't find much of that there, there is a lot of implication, but only 1 really violent scene.

This movie could have been better had the story flowed a little smoother, but I felt it was watchable and an interesting take on the Mexican Drug Cartel The acting was done well, but I felt like perhaps the editing or writing was very weak. There are some scenes that are kind of confusing (perhaps I'm just missing the point), and I'm not sure they were necessarily placed in the most effective order. This is too bad, because the overall story was engaging and the general flow of the story was interesting from beginning to end.I think Fassbender does a decent job playing the ""Counselor"". He has to go through an emotional roller coaster and he does a good job of taking you on that ride with him. Cruz plays his fiancé Laura. She does an effective job in the role, but I think they could have done a better job with her because you don't really seem to feel the emotion that supposedly exists between her and the Counselor. I think they try to build her up to be very important, but I never got to that point with her.Bardem and Diaz both do a good job. I liked Bardem's fast talking Reimer and his scenes felt more engaging to me. The only problem was some of his dialogue scenes kind of fell apart at the end, but I think that had do with the writing more than the acting. Diaz is still very sexy and she oozes sexuality in this film as Malkina. Some people may disagree because she's not in her 20s anymore, but I think that was supposed to be the point here.Pitt does a good job as Westray. He is more of a secondary character, but like Bardem, he is able to carry the dialogue heavy scenes well.Something was definitely wrong with this movie. Maybe it was bad editing, or bad writing in some parts, but the overall story was very interesting and most of the acting was able to hold it together. If you go in with this in mind, you should enjoy the movie and the story it tells.",The Counselor
177,ajping,One of the most horribly scripted films in living memory - read the book instead,2,24 February 2014,"Remember that high school assignment were you have to take your essay and present it to the class? The teacher wants you to make note cards and adapt your material to the different format. But there is always one or two kids who stand up and read their essay. This is sort of what is happening in ""The Counselor."" An excellent book has been taken almost verbatim and dropped onto the screen. This is, of course, a disaster. The big screen doesn't need as much verbiage because we have costumes and actors to look at. It's OK to leave a few bits of dialog out and rely on facial expressions instead - we really don't need to hear every word. Diaz is a particularly awful casting choice. She only has one facial expression during the entire movie. Fassbender and Pitt do a decent job despite the crap they force out of their mouths. But this has a lot to do with the limited amount of dialog their characters have - they have the least ridiculous things to say.",The Counselor

180,JW-30,Good everything. Bad script.,4,16 December 2013,"Actors and production values are of really good quality, you get to see memorable scenes and some good acting as well - but all in all, this movie is less than bland: it drains.The script about a drug deal gone wrong, a greedy lawyers ruining his otherwise perfect life - that could've been an excellent thriller. But this movie doesn't thrill. It has extreme graphic violence, intense and intimate sex scenes, car chases, well planned and executed murder, luxurious settings - but it doesn't thrill.It has good and highly paid actors, an excellent director - but the characters don't come to life, they feel like cardboard cutouts. There is one big fault this movie has, and that's its script. Wordy monologues (and it has half a dozen) don't make a movie bad or boring, if they fit in well. The monologues here don't. Gangsters with philosophical musings can be funny, entertaining, tragic or sometimes even believable - here, it doesn't fit. (The list goes on, I better stop.)Now, Cormac McCarthy is know to be an excellent author, at age of 80 still writing stories that win awards. Some of his books have been made into great films - after professional scriptwriters adapted them into movie scripts. This is the first script he wrote himself, and maybe he tries to learn scriptwriting now; but I'm afraid it will be a long way. Todays funny-zombie-movies or run-of-the-mill action flicks have better dramaturgy and dialogue than the script of The Counselor. There are different rules for what makes a book work, and what makes a movie work.Avoid this movie, and watch ""No Country for Old Men"" instead. It's based on a Cormac McCarthy novel, the Coen brothers adapted it, and it turned out excellent. ""The Counselor"" - did not.PS: The Counselor in this movie receives counsel from about everybody, from inmates to Mexican barkeepers, but himself never gives counsel. Was that intended as a joke? Didn't make me laugh.",The Counselor

I so wanted some redeeming plot twist to occur, but it just fell deeper into a black hole of despair.There was no-one, nothing to cling to in an effort to pull you out of the quicksand of nothingness. Just nothing.And if you read all of this, then you might just find meaning in the diatribe spouted by the meanest muvverfukker on the phone to Fassbender as he puts the last nail in the coffin of hope.

The opening sequence is long and boring (I mean, we fast-forward porn, why should we watch the whole scene here?) and Cruz is underused. Cameron Diaz looks like my grandma, was she supposed to be sexy? Bardem is playing Bardem who plays Bardem in ""No country for old men"". Fassbender is a nice actor, too bad he can't play a role without whispering half of the movie, so annoying! Brad Pitt does what he can to save the day but... ""snuff movies"", really?

185,lucius_420,Amazing cast lost to a pathetic script and poor direction,2,23 December 2013,"I was expecting a lot from this movie and was very disappointed in it. Ridley Scott, while not the world's greatest director, has made some good ones I really loved before, especially in the science fiction realm such as Blade Runner and Alien. He should stick to science fiction. I feel that what was going through his mind while making this movie was that he thought this was going to be a real art piece with superb cinematography and also a thinking man's movie and also a gangster thriller! However, this original script idea by Cormac McCarthy is just not what he is looking for! That kind of writing should stay in a book where it belongs. Have some vision man, write your own story. It attempted to be a mystery story about a guy who has connections with some mafia type guys and he deals in diamonds (I think? Maybe he just has some diamonds, I do not know if that is made clear) and then he gets involved in some drug trade. OK so all that is not the actual plot. Cameron Diaz just is a psycho woman who knows how to pull strings and kill his girlfriend (I mean wife) and take his diamonds (since it is easier to transport money that way because now she has to disappear, although she never is given a motive for anything except that she is evil and likes to watch others suffer) but there is not really any proper pacing to this ""story"". There's so many loose ends it rivals the number of strands of hair on my head.The ""Counselor"" is Michael Fassbender. Where did he come from? Oh yeah, he did great acting as the evil android in Prometheus (that science fiction movie). There are about three real action scenes that are each no more than three minutes long and just gut wrench shock value gore effects catering to the sadist in all of us which is in poor taste. The music never does anything to liven up the scenes of actors talking. Mind you, there are some great actors here, some of whom I felt out shone the direction given to them. Brad Pitt for example delivered his lines and played his character so amazingly well and I kept praying for him to get an action scene since he was supposed to be the action guy part of the story but all he ever got was a very short gruesome throat squirting from a special little self closing electric garrote wire. I have to admit I always did want to see that happen to him, but I have come to respect his acting more over the years, he has gotten so much better since his early films. Cameron Diaz is amazingly beautiful but I still do not feel much emotion from her. If I put Cameron Diaz and Penelope Cruz on a scale of 1 to 5 for hotness and acting, then I put Diaz at 5 for hot and 2 for acting, and as for Cruz she gets a 4 for hot and a 1 for acting. About the worst it gets. Javier Bardem has a warm presence, but his lines are not quite so witty or thoughtful or provocative as the writer would like you to believe, and he ends up on the sidelines never making any moves on the chessboard, merely an observer who laughs that some crazy woman he is obsessed with is going to do evil things to his close friend the counselor. This story and character development makes no sense at all and is totally unrealistic by all stretches of the imagination.I kept watching this ""story"" ""unfold"" as it were and it tries to make you think it's going deeper and deeper into a crime mystery, but never goes anywhere. Who is this Councelor guy? Why does the main character never take any action at all against the threats against his family? How did he ever have any smarts at all enough to have diamonds??? Or was he just born rich and you never told me? All he does is cry when his toys are taken away. The end. Everything is laid bare at the start, there's no foreshadowing or guesswork involved. There are a lot of questions going on in your mind about the connections between these people in the ""story"" and how they are going to react to each other. The title screams mobsters all over it yet there is no existence of these types of characters in this movie. It is very boring and dull, devoid of life except for a few things. They have the most expensive cameras on the planet #1 and #2 Brad Pitt delivers a few brief lines quite well and #3 There is probably the best scene and saving grace of the entire fiasco where a guy sets up a wire across the road to decapitate a smuggler who rides his motorcycle across the border at 200 miles per hour. Short and bloody sweet but that's only 2 minutes of the movie. The rest is anal seepage from Hollywood. Fassbender was pretty to look at, but he never was very captivating delivering his uninspired lines, it seems almost as if he wished he had not been cast in that movie. Jack Nicholson, Dennis Hopper, he was not very charismatic. I blame the director and writer and producers for wasting Fassbender's talent which we clearly saw in Prometheus. The Counselor is not a very good movie, but hey he got to be the leading role in a multi-million dollar picture, now he will likely be used for something more useful in the near future coming soon to a theater near you, let's keep praying the next time it will be science fiction. He can act better than that god awful Colin Farrell and does not look as flaming gay although maybe they could be gay lovers.",The Counselor
186,onewhoseesme,No Amount Of Money Can Make You Great,9,16 June 2014,"We were told about this ahead of time, that in the Last Days it would become very dangerous. Two of the things that make the days dangerous are that men become lovers of Self and lovers of Money. Selfish and greedy are the kind of people that are on display here. They are experts at their craft, with all of them at the top of their game. Including the writer and director. That is part of what they want us to see. There are no hero's or heroines, only wolves and one queen of the damned. She thinks herself a predator of predators, but she is only full of pride. Two odd events occur because of it, one with a Ferrari the other speaking to a priest. As with Hannibal Lecter, she does these things out of sheer contempt for others. The only virtue was murdered in a snuff film and thrown out with the trash. You don't see it, but more than implied; it is clearly understood. If you know what you are looking at. You are in fact expected to. It speaks only the language of those in the know. This is a sharp slick well heeled and highly polished view of the way we are now. At least at the top of the food chain of those that devour each other. How we have become as a people and a society who placed acquiring things above the saving of souls, more than a century ago. You don't have to be a drug dealer to fit in here, just shallow and materialistic. A very west coast ethos is portrayed, especially that of Southern California.By the end of the film evil is speaking of its own purity. Which is a flat out lie because the position it is taking is a false position. It does no exist. Its false premise is that of Evil being the equal opposite of Good, which is dualism. Not Christianity. Many who do not perceive the difference between them think the two are the same thing, but they are not. The difference is vast. Lucifer is a fallen archangel who was created good and of his own free will became bad. God is not his opposite, God does not have an opposite. The opposite of Lucifer would be Michael, another archangel. The one who kicked him out of Heaven.Good and evil are not opposites and they are not equal, not even a little. Evil is a parasite of good. A bank robber, a drug dealer or a murderer are all going after good things. They are just going about getting them the wrong way, that's what is evil. Choosing the wrong way to get what you want. Because there is a right way. Houses and cars and money are all good in themselves. Evil needs good just to exist, good does not need evil at all. Any more than you need some parasite sucking your blood or eating your organs. You would be much better off without them. That's what the next world is about, all of the Good none of the bad.Money is not the root of all evil, the Bible does not say that. It says the Love of money is the root of all evil. This film is an excellent portrait of that. It would be a mistake to think this only applies to drug traffickers. This kind of thing is done in business every single day by men and women throughout the entire world, among the rich and the poor. Men are stabbing each other in the back and cutting each others throats by the millions, in normal acceptable business practices. Criminals are just much more straightforward about it. More visceral more immediate, more honest. They are just very very mistaken.Most convicts don't think they deserve the punishment they got, their only regret is that they were caught. What we keep seeing here is a bunch of people who haven't been punished, living their lives as though there won't be a reckoning. The darkness does not comprehend the Light. It never has. The Judgment will change all that. Nobody you know has ever gotten away with anything, and nobody will. It's not over yet. There are some nuggets of truth here and there, it is as well written as Mamet or Clancy. But it's not the truth that sets you free, that's another fractional misquote from the Bible. It is only the truth you know that sets you free. Let me give you a little. Jesus said ""This is the verdict: Light has come into the world, but men loved darkness instead of light because their deeds were evil. Everyone who does evil hates the light, and will not come into the light for fear that his deeds will be exposed. But whoever lives by the truth comes into the light, so that it may be seen plainly that what he has done has been done through God.""

187,anteksw,An Average Execution of a Decent Plot,8,13 June 2014,"Okay, here goes nothing. Let's start with the most common issue in this film according to me; wasting valuable potential, this applies to the misuse of the amazing cast, the clever writing somehow turning into a slightly bland, slow-paced, cliché drug-related drama and arguably the biggest issue with this film... the pointless dialogue. I'm not in any way undermining McCarthy's God-given talent of writing pure excellence, what I'm saying is that this film is simply an average execution of a decent and surprisingly compelling plot (despite all the clichés), which is quite upsetting since Ridley Scott usually doesn't disappoint with dramas such as the brilliant 'American Gangster'.Now for the positive aspects. As I admitted previously, the film does contain some clever writing (especially with foreshadowing) and in this case the character of Cameron Diaz really shines through (also on the wind shield). Her sinister presence actually evokes a chilling tone; sexiness combined with evil and psychopathic thoughts provides the audience with something to look forward to past the boring dialogue, furthermore it's nice to see Diaz experimenting with her acting skills and portraying a truly despicable woman. In regards to the rest of the cast... as I said, it just wastes potential in terms of depth; the lack of character development leaves us with bland archetypal characters carrying the plot along, with Fassbender crying every five minutes and Bardem talking about women throughout the whole film. I'm not implying the acting is bad, hell no, the acting is great, it just feels like the characters weren't explored enough for the audience to be truly engaged.Let's actually try and talk about the good parts this time. The cinematography is gorgeous, the settings and the overall aesthetic of the film is absolutely beautiful to gaze upon. The gore aspect doesn't disappoint either, being a Tarantino & Scorsese fan myself I enjoy a bit of gore now and again in films; but only if it has a purpose and if it is executed well... which in this case applies. Despite constantly bashing the pointless dialogue, there is some decent dialogue also... you just gotta sit through all the bullshit first. The overall conclusion of the film doesn't disappoint either; with life lessons being reinforced and actually leaving the audience with something to think about is a very nice and satisfying finish.To conclude, I have a love/hate relationship with this film. However, since the enticing trailers lived up to the hype they built up for me, concluding in overall satisfaction after watching the film... I'm deciding to give it a mild 8 (yeah I know, surprising for the amount of negativity I wrote about). I just wanted you all to know what to expect when going into this film, I don't believe it is as disappointing as the ratings suggest (I've seen films far worse with much better ratings here on IMDb). I say give it a watch, even if it leaves you slightly disappointed you'll still have something to think about... and perhaps reconsider.",The Counselor
188,Iwould,the big advice,10,28 April 2015,"One year after the release, I have now seen this movie a couple (of couples) of times, and there is something I need to write down about it. In short: I feel this is one of the greatest movies I have seen in a while, and I believe that it will be considered much more relevant than many so-called contemporary masterpieces from tomorrow's critics and audiences. I am perfectly aware of the long list of remarks this movie have received: too many dialogues, don't understand the story, the Ferrari rape, too much overall seriousness throughout the whole thing. All these observations would be quite correct if The Counselor was intended to be a normal movie, say, a drug story with some romance, some action, all of them nicely packaged between a credible beginning and a logical ending. But The Counselor is one of those very rare movies that are done to make a statement, not to tell a story. The statement is not subtle, and should be more than clear already if you have seen the movie, but I will repeat it: evil exists, so beware, because you can choose to stay away from it or to mess with it, and if you mess with evil, then evil mess with you – to, eventually, prevail.I believe that in front of certain movies you have to move out from the nerdish attitude, stop looking for flaws in the story and dialogues. The people in the movie do not talk (or behave, btw) like normal people, simply because they are not normal people: they are examples, metaphors, personification of greed, weakness, cruelty, innocence. In this story, on the stage there are not people but some capital sins and (few) heavenly virtues, and they are being acted from a bunch of very talented artists – unless of course you think they are portraying real people, and in this case the actors really would look like a bunch of clowns.I have been familiar with Cormac McCarthy writing and themes for many years now. He has a very peculiar look on things, which means that he sees strange things in what everybody else see as normal, and viceversa (more or less in the exact same way Cameron Diaz and Penelope Cruz misunderstand each other in the swimming pool scene). This peculiarity is very hard to translate on the screen, because is not entirely related to something that can be seen, or shown. That's why people talk so much in this movie, and that's why most of the talk is made by those who in Penelope Cruz world would be called the ""bad guys"". They are trying to give some advice. ""Counselor"" may be the name of the main character, yes, but it's more clearly the name of the movie. After many years of fascination, attraction and understanding with the Dark Side, we are uncomfortable with The Counselor, because The Counselor is, very unusually, Evil advocating against himself: and we should listen closely, because it could represents a chance to understand how to stay out from hell, if not forever, at least a little longer than we are expected to do.",The Counselor

This movie falls under the ""get it"" or ""don't get it"" category. If you get it you'll love every minute, if you don't you're bored shitless. Luckily I was one of those who got it and loved it. You have to look through the pretentious dialogue and look what's going on. All the actors were on top of their game. I was pretty much the first time I saw Bardem as a ""good"" guy. Well good would be stretching it but he was not the antagonist. Diaz as the crazy bitch who moves the strings of the puppets was great although she overdid it a bit. Fassbender didn't play such a strong type as he usually does. His ""Counselor"" was a bit naive and unsure. Bratt Pitt of course has the whole sleazy thing down. Director Ridley Scott made sure that everything looked good and stylish. I hope some time in the future people will look back and appreciate this movie for what it is. A piece of art.",The Counselor

Someone like Sofia Vergara/beautiful woman would be a better fit for this villainous part. I wasted only my time, no money thankfully. Watch a real drama with a thrilling storyline.

192,Joe_Chadowski,"Glitzy, schmaltzy and turgid. Completely unbecoming of the talent involved",5,25 October 2013,"It breaks my heart, and simultaneously infuriates me to report that The Counselor is subpar. And the problem can be narrowed down to one thing; the narrative. Or the lack thereof. The Counselor is written by Cormac McCarthy, a novelist who specializes in leaden stories highlighting the corruption of humans, and who rose to fame as the author of No Country for Old Men. Although untested as a screenwriter, McCarthy as a screenwriter just seemed to gel as an idea. Herein lies the problem; McCarthy does not alter his method of writing and The Counselor's screenplay is delivered akin to a novel. The result is a film completely devoid of a narrative, meaning the story an background of the characters is non-existent. The result is a collection of scenes happening in some sort of ham- fisted, incoherent jumble, and the characters in the movie just react to their surroundings. There is both a lack of description in the attempted story and a disquieting air of self-satisfaction that permeates throughout the film. Ridley Scott's effort to woo you with pseudo- prophetic dialogue and kitsch is downright insulting, and completely unbecoming of the director of Blade Runner and Alien. (Two of the greatest films of all time.) In other words, Counselor neither as incisive nor as blunt as it could have been.On the flip side, I can't think of a better vehicle to prove that film is an art. On paper, The Counselor has everything going for it; the cast, the director, screenwriter. And yet, the result is a failure Film, like anything that can be considered art, is the collaborative effort of a collective idea. The Counselor is a jumbled mess that tries to be everything, and ends up being nothing. What a waste of talent.",The Counselor
193,brickmoviereviews,The Counselor: I Advise You to Stay Away,1,28 October 2013,"Down in Mexico, drugs flow like water. When a successful lawyer decides to go into business with criminals to get a piece of the action, the blood starts flowing too. The Counselor focuses on the Counselor (Michael Fassbender) and his business dealings after he becomes engaged to Laura (Penelope Cruz). With things going smoothly in his life, the Counselor tries to make some money on the side by getting himself mixed in with drug trafficking and opening a club with his friend, Reiner (Javier Bardem). Being a successful businessman and criminal, Reiner is mixed up in a confusing sexual relationship with Malkina (Cameron Diaz) who ultimately has ulterior motives from standing by Reiner's side. With the club being funded by Westray (Brad Pitt), things for the Counselor could not be better, that is until one of his clients, Ruth (Rosie Perez), calls the Counselor from jail, and asks him to get her son released from jail over a speeding ticket.Thinking nothing of it, the Counselor gets Ruth's son out of jail. Once released, the son meets a man at a coffee house, picks up a device that belongs on the truck that is trafficking drugs, and leaves the meeting. All the while, an assassin had been spying on the meeting, and set a trap for Ruth's son, who speeds down the roads at over 200 MPH. After the son is dead, the assassin collects the device, and leaves the body in the road. The people Ruth's son were working for suspect the Counselor was behind the killing, since he freed the son from jail. Fearing for their lives, the Counselor, Reiner, and Westray scramble to save themselves.Plain and simple, The Counselor, directed by Ridley Scott, is awful. The movie does not make any sense. The opening scene is an awkward lovemaking scene between Fassbender's Counselor and Cruz's Laura, and then proceeds to have sex as an underlying theme in the movie, which was, in my opinion, completely unnecessary. The movie is confusing enough without adding aspects that do not even remotely make sense in context. Throughout the entire 117 minutes, The Counselor jumps from scene to scene, plot point to plot point, without any sort of transition or explanation. To be honest, I had absolutely no idea what the movie was even about until I looked it up when I got back from the theater. Drugs were only seen twice, at the beginning and the end of the movie, and only mentioned once, which was strange given the fact that the movie was about drug trafficking. The acting was OK. None of the actors stood out and gave memorable performances. The storytelling was sloppy and haphazardly thrown together, and the writing was terrible. Quite frankly, my favorite part of the movie was the end credits.Of the duds of October movie releases (Runner Runner, The Fifth Estate), The Counselor is by far the WORST of them all. Granted, I gave Runner Runner and OK review and The Fifth Estate an mediocre review at best, I would recommend those movies a thousand times before I would recommend The Counselor once. The movie was sloppily made, confusing, poorly written, uninteresting, and boring.

195,SeussMeTub,"Bleak, Nihilistic Coolness",10,13 November 2013,"Don't listen to the critics! The Counselor is a bleak and unrelenting thriller of the first order that serves as an excellent companion piece to Cormac McCarthy's award winning No Country For Old Men. If the latter movie traces the beginnings of the drug war in Texas in the early 1980's then The Counselor serves as its inevitable aftermath; the drug trade has made many of its players rich and the competition has made killings far more widespread and fiercer than ever. With more money being made the more dangerous it has become- bankers and unscrupulous politicians are now in on the take and so the stakes have gone past heaven.In this potential nightmare scenario exists the title character played by Michael Fassbender, he is a highly successful defense lawyer with a somewhat naive fiancée played by Penelope Cruz and his shady coterie which consists of a wisecracking middleman named Westray (Brad Pitt), nightclub owner and part time dealer Reiner (Javier Bardem) and his viper of a girlfriend Malkina (Cameron Diaz). The counselor is in a bit over his head due to his lavish lifestyle and so decides to do one drug deal to pay off his debts. Of course, with these amoral characters the inevitable betrayal begins and we follow each and every one as the downward spiral ends in a bloody orgy of pain and death.Cormac McCarthy's novels have always been about life and death and the decisions one takes that leads to their respective outcomes- his books are perfect analogies of existentialism. With this, his first original screenplay, McCarthy essentially goes over the same territory that he covered in No Country For Old Men but this time everything has gone corporate- the Mexican Cartel now controls the drug trade in the southwest United States and anyone who dares to cross its path will face an unrelenting army of thugs and assassins until they meet a gruesome end. This pervading sense of doom permeates the entire movie and does not let go; I think the reason why most critics didn't like this film is because there is no humor, no catharsis to pull back the nihilism that pervades the entire storyline. Whereas in No Country For Old Men, the Coen brothers were able to inject their dark humor into the movie, Ridley Scott's directorial skills in this film allows no such reprieve.Fassbender is excellent as the title character; its clear that all his skills as a top defense lawyer has come for naught as he gets involved with things way beyond his expectations; seeing his breakdown into a broken man is a thing to behold. Bardem is as quirky as ever as his best buddy Reiner- his tinted eye glasses, psychedelic clothes and puffed up hair is perfect for the role. Brad Pitt is adequate as the knowledgeable Westray (who seems to be playing a variation of the bounty hunter character that Woody Harrelson played in No Country For Old Men) but its Cameron Diaz who steals the show as the cunning and sociopathic Malkina- she seems to be the new embodiment of death- sultry, seductive and deftly using everyone towards her ultimate goal. Even the bit parts are played by popular actors such Dean Norris, Bruno Ganz, Rosie Perez, John Leguizamo, Edgar Ramirez and Ruben Blades.",The Counselor
196,Tailgunner1944,Don't Waste Your Money or Time,1,13 November 2013,"Watched this movie in the theatre. At the end of it, you had several patrons scream out in disgust like they had been cheated! It movies like this that make me want to run for Congress, so that I can introduce a law that forces movie theatres to issue refunds to customers for showing remarkably and magnificently bad movies! Great cast with marvelous acting. Michael Fassbender, Brad Pitt, and Jarvier Bardem were at their best. What kills this movie is the story. While the movie is unnecessarily long with countless pointless scenes, the story itself is quite captivating and leaves you on the edge of your seat. That is until the end- literarily. You had patrons screaming, ""what!"" It is as if the filmmakers ran out of money, then stopped filming, called it a day, and then sent this tremendously pointless monstrosity to us in the theatres.

197,Ser_Stephen_Seaworth,The Counselor: A Shakespearean tragedy of greed and desperation.,10,25 October 2013,"The Counselor, like previous McCarthy adaptations, is gorgeous to behold, but unlike No Country and the others, this one is unnervingly bright, lensed in iridescent yellows and grungy grim tones. It lacks the scope of a Gladiator or a Kingdom of Heaven, instead acting as a somehow intimate, character-driven (or perhaps ""dialogue-driven"" is better) tale. It is, one could say, Ridley Scott's first fable (yes, Legend notwithstanding). Allow me to explain. The story, like most McCarthy tales, is simple: a nameless lawyer (Fassbender), madly in love with his fiancée Laura (Cruz) and seeking to provide for her and give her the life she deserves, decides to get in a once-and-I'm-out deal: namely, to get involved in a venture dealing with twenty million dollars worth of drugs being ferried to the States from Mexico. The counselor's associates in this job are the flamboyant Reiner (Javier Bardem, returning to McCarthy's bleak world yet again, though this time sporting a Brian Grazer-esque hairdo instead of Chigurh's pageboy) and middleman Westray (Brad Pitt, sporting a Tom Petty style), both of whom warn the counselor that this deal will change his life in ways he cannot fathom. The film also focuses on Reiner's Argentinean squeeze Malkina, played by Cameron Diaz. Malkina is a glammed-up diva in the Donatella Versace vein (comparable to Kristin Scott Thomas's equally diva-like turn in Only God Forgives; they could be sisters), sporting a cheetah-spot design tattooed to her throat and a felicitous feline sneer everywhere she turns (she even owns a pair of cheetahs that she sics on desert jackrabbits for her and Reiner's amusement). Of course, as is wont to happen in McCarthy's world, something goes wrong, sh_t hits the fan, and the lives of every character hangs in the balance. Characters are sliced, diced, shot and (in one gruesome instance) subject to a weapon of grim ingenuity that involves a motor, a loop of unbreakable wire, and a jetting gout of blood. Yet the film also brings levity to it in spades, to the point that The Counselor could almost be considered a black comedy. Much of the film's action is ""interaction,"" as the counselor deals with the other characters that warn, judge, and even blame him for the capricious trick of fate that has sealed their own. McCarthy's penchant for cipher-like monologues is in full play here, and it can bog down an unwary traveler. That said, for all of its deep soliloquies and terse warnings, the film is not indecipherable, and at times McCarthy's caustic wit comes across brilliantly. Scott and McCarthy manage to coax some pretty impressive work from their cadre. Michael Fassbender, whose character is himself little more than an archetype (the ""good man who f_cks up once and pays for it dearly""), is actually quite good here, and I'm probably in the minority when I say that I prefer his turn here over his acclaimed performance in Shame (a film I respect but have little affection for). Cruz makes the most of a rather lightweight part, and even though her character exists as little more than an ideal, it still works. Bardem is, for once, the comic relief, playing an entrancingly funny motormouth who is the polar opposite of his last McCarthy character. He is the one who has the most fun with the dialogue and despite English being his second language, he nails Cormac's every nuance. Pitt's Westray is laid-back yet high-strung, and seems an easy fit for the actor, giving every line a wry twist. But the true revelation is Diaz's against-type turn. She is the character audiences will remember most of all, and not just because of her fornication with a Bentley (it makes sense in context . . . I think). There is a hard, wicked steel in her performance, almost predatory. There are other memorable turns, like Ruben Blades's one-scene wonder and even Dean Norris of Breaking Bad fame, that make this a truly sumptuous ensemble. The Counselor is not an easy watch, both because of its violence and because Scott and McCarthy (I have to credit both men; it feels like such a collaborative creative effort) don't dumb it down. It's a simple story, but it's also one that feels like Scott's most mature work. It isn't without its flaws (certain scenes run on a bit long, while others feel a bit short-changed), but The Counselor results in a perverse viewing that is, in a word, unforgettable.",The Counselor

200,hkfilmbuff,A cautionary tale with unnecessary gore and sexuality,2,2 September 2014,"My interest was piqued by the 3 male leads, and to a lesser extent the director, but it turned out to be a disappointment.In essence, this is a moral tale about a semi-decent lawyer who got greedy and had to pay dearly for his mistake. The irony was that he was inadvertently ""betrayed"" by an act of kindness/compassion. This could have been a classical masterpiece, on the level of ancient Greek or Shakespearean tragedies, but degenerated into an overwrought, perverted vehicle of cheap gore and sex. Frankly, I find the morality hard to swallow, being preached by some drug-trafficking mafia don. Instead of a cautionary tale of tragedy and irony, what hits you between the eyes is the utter ruthlessness, cruelty, and evil of the criminal world.The writer's lofty aspirations backfired, in my opinion. The moral tale was laid down, it seems to me, by a number of questionable characters, a diamond expert, a middle-man of sorts (a ""respectable"" man of legitimate standing but with connections to the criminal world), and the crime lord (an evil person who wants to teach me ""every action has consequences"" and ""mistakes cannot be undone""?) To hear high-sounding ""sermon"" coming out of the mouths of sleazy characters is just ludicrous.Hearing a description of the brutality and sex is already quite enough, to add those extra scenes of indirectly explicit sex and explicit gore is certainly overkill, to the point of revolting.What a waste!",The Counselor
201,stonekeeper_ever,Time to boost the score a little,7,31 January 2015,"I give this movie a 7. Its a bit generous from me, I know, but its mainly because of the low score it actually has. (I'd like to excuse my french in advance im from Canada, Quebec).I've recently watched Killing Them Softly and I have to say I was a bit disappointed as my expectations were high. I gave the movie a 6. I think The Counselor and Killing them Soflty are two movies that can be compared.Now I read the critics before watching The counselor and my expectations were lower, and I have to say I do not agree with the bashing comments on this movie. Of course it's no Smoking Aces or no Running Scared, but not so far behind. I liked the general ambiance of the movie, contrary to Killing them Softly. Cameron was not as bad as some people claim. Fassbender showed great emotion and the rest of the cast was nothing less then acceptable. For some reason I loved the septic truck. All the scenes including it were disgustingly beautiful. Now for all the people who claimed there was no link between many scenes, I don't know what you people were on when you watched the movie. I was a little high (as always when I watch a movie) when I watched it and to my memory there is not one scene that doesn't have a purpose to the plot. Obviously I have small deceptions, per example, the first hour of the film would have needed at least one action scene. Unfortunately they had us waiting more then half of the movie before there's violence. ***SPOILER*** Another thing is that when Reiner died and the cat come close to him they make us think its gonna eat him. Thats not the problem. The problem is after you realize the cheetah just takes a sniff at his body before running away, I was expecting/hoping that the cat would find the guys who killed him and avenge his master. Maybe I have a bit too much imagination...All in all, not a bad movie. Good dialogues (better then Killing them softly) good feel to the whole thing. I don't like the score showing here so I give it a 7/10",The Counselor
202,housecountrywife,"Great film, was much surprised",10,8 November 2018,"I have the unrated blu-ray, and it was laying around for a few months before I finally got bored enough to watch it. As I put it on, I was working at home and using it as background noise, and kept being distracted from my work by the dialogue of the movie, and eventually stopped working just to watch it. I ended up watching it twice in a row!This is a dialogue driven film, as someone else said here, dialogue driven much like a Tarantino film. If you're just looking for action, blood & guts only, do not watch this. If you want to watch a screwed up movie, get the unrated blu-ray. I consider this film an mini-epic, it's not super long but it has the traits and qualities of epic crime films.Best of all, this film covers the Mexico-USA/World drug trafficking trade, which I feel is swept under the rug in the USA in favor of the crisis in the middle east, so for anyone unaware of the bloodbath happening in America and it's neighbor Mexico, you should see this and consider it an educational film. 10 stars",The Counselor
203,JenniferClapton,What happened to this thing,2,29 June 2014,"I don't understand this movie. They talk like in metaphors throughout the whole thing, c'mon, NOBODY talks that way. The best character in the movie was the one played by Javier Bardem, at least he had some depth but I refuse to believe anybody would walk around with that hairdo in real life, he looked ridiculous.And do they really expect us to believe that Brad Pitt's character would have fallen for an obvious plant like the one presented to him in the lobby? She had the slinky dress the makeup and beauty salon hairdo that screams, I would never date you in real life so I must be a plant. His character was too experienced to have fallen for that stunt even though he mentioned he had a weakness for women in the beginning of the film. He wouldn't have acted so recklessly knowing he was a wanted man, especially in the first few days of hiding.Cameron Diaz was the wrong choice for her role but maybe it was just the terrible script, I can't tell. And she was supposed to have an accent? Really?? Couldn't tell except for her talking weird a few times so I actually had to google it. She was really terrible. I understand they made her redo all her lines for the movie so we shouldn't blame her entirely.Penelope Cruz looked absolutely beautiful but they made her character annoying during her love scene in the beginning. I don't know why, that just annoyed me. Let's give Cameron some credit though, her splits on top of the car was impressive, if that was really her.The Cheetahs were a cheesy addition to the movie. They tried to tie it into Cameron's character but it was just lame and added to the cheese fest.It's entertaining enough to sit through the whole thing but at the end you're left feeling unfulfilled and just bleh.",The Counselor

205,scherfcom,"Positive Surpirse: A well-made movie with a touch of ""Traffic""",8,26 October 2013,"In brief: I liked the movie. It was worth watching and it was well made, meaning a very good cast, good chemistry all around, good ambiance, stylish with attention to detail. Fassbender was a positive surprise ... really good. The first scene was pretty much unnecessary and could have been cut as the movie was about 10 minutes too long anyway. The pace increased into a strong finish after it had a few dull moments before that finish.The best couple of lines in the flick, ""Truth doesn't have (know) a temperature"" and ""Grief transcends value"" ... yeah, a bit of philosophical stuff in there. Bottom line message like in most bare-knuckle crime flicks, just don't do the crime, don't get involved if you don't want to put your life on the line. It's no longer ""don't do the crime if you can't do the time"" but rather just don't dabble into crime no matter what if your life and the life of your loved ones are dear to you.It did remind me a bit of ""Traffic"" although ""Traffic"" was much more graphic and more violent, etc., ... and having said that ""The Counsel(l)or"" is NOT a hardcore R-rated movie, even though you don't want your kids to watch it. It's pretty smooth for a Saturday afternoon to relax, ... it's not a very engaging movie, but interesting to watch if you appreciate the acting skills of Bardem, Pitt, Fassbender and Diaz. Overall nice scenery: Ciudad Juarez, London, U.S. desert ... Again, a cool flick, not really shocking and it doesn't glamorize crime, because little by little almost everyone is killed off.",The Counselor
206,CEBaum,"Strangely satisfying, albeit totally ruthless",7,6 November 2013,"The Scott-McCarthy union is far from a train wreck it's been proclaimed in certain corners. In fact, it's often quite enjoyable, even as it blatantly flies in the face of your average viewer's expectations.Plenty of great novelists have made bumpy transitions to screen writing. McCarthy is no exception, but in Scott's hands The Counselor is a strangely satisfying, albeit totally ruthless, tale of greed and its consequences.Like so many of McCarthy's novels, The Counselor is set near the Texas-Mexico border, and involves its share of shady figures with opaque agendas. This time, however, the author has turned his attention to the grisliest possible side of human decay: drug trafficking, and the violence that goes with it.As much as the film has been promoted as a blood-soaked thriller, there's very little violence over the nearly two hour duration. With no room on the page to fill with gorgeously-wrought passages about grand themes, McCarthy sticks a great deal of it in the mouths of his characters. It's a decision that provides any number of strong moment, but is still the film's Achilles Heel. As best as the cast try, there are some lines that are just too ""written,"" and they feel clumsy coming out of the mouths of human beings, even ones as broadly symbolic as these. Thankfully, Mr. Scott and his collaborators keep the whole thing moving along quite nicely, and deliver a polished, if frequently imperfect film. For all of its broader elements, The Counselor is still classic McCarthy, and Scott attacks the pulpy material with enough gusto so as to ensure more than a few stand-out moments. Working with recent collaborator Dariusz Wolski, the film is as rich and glossy as Scott's best, without ever suffocating the material. And, for a director known for staging marathon-length action sequences, he's able to rattle off the film's few flashes of violence with elegance and brevity. Relatively new composer Daniel Pemberton also makes a powerful impression with his ghostly score, which lends even the plainest of dialogues an undercurrent of impending catastrophe.One of the Counselor's most frequently used words in the film is ""Jesus."" Whether hearing something outrageous (a scene with Malkina and car that's sure to leave one talking), or horrific, this invocation of a deity is perhaps his last line of defense from the inky black world in which he's enmeshed himself. At first Fassbender's delivery is almost casual, as though he has no true need of the same religion that Laura holds so dearly. Yet as things inevitably go south, that delivery becomes gradually more panicked. Yet a hollowness remains, but with a purpose: the Counselor needs the intervention of a benevolent higher power, yet also realizes that he's gone past the point of saving.That's the sort of world that Scott mercilessly plunges one into, and it's certainly not for everybody. But either way, it's likely to leave you talking about something. In one early scene, the Counselor visits a diamond dealer (Bruno Ganz), who informs him that what defines a diamond are its little flaws, and that ""The perfect diamond would be composed of nothing but light."" That sentiment also applies to this icy gut punch of a film. It may be littered with imperfections, some particularly disappointing, but in a sense they help define what makes this film – Scott's best in quite some time – work so well.

Most of us are just ordinary and do not have the luxury of having a photographic memory and top DNA. To be a HOT SHOT lawyer I think it is most probably a necessity to have both of these.

He's not happy with his lot, so as well as defending scumbag criminals he aims to become one himself. Yes he's GREEDY and this will be his downfall.I saw this in the flicks on release week and enjoyed it, I then watched it again later at home, and yet again just now this evening.

217,Hello_Im_David,Bipolar Disorder,6,1 November 2013,"How can I explain a movie like The Counselor. It is one of those movies that tears me down the middle. I love it and I hate it at the same time. There are two very distinct sides of this movie. One is the film as a story and the other the film as art. By art I mean meaning behind the story. Most movies these days are all story, with little art behind that story. Think of the big blockbusters or even the big Oscar movies like Argo. There is only the plot, behind it there is either nothing or very little. The Counselor is the exact reverse. The story is there, but it's so thin that at times it almost feels like it's missing all together. At the same time, this movie perhaps more than any other this year makes you think. It is a philosophical piece, with weighty dialogue and big questions. I always enjoy a movie that makes you think, especially because there're so rare. But that is not enough for a movie to stand on its own. There has to be a compelling story. There has to be something to keep the viewer involved in the film, and in this regard The Counselor somewhat fails. The plot is slow moving, it doesn't keep focus and it is generally confusing and convoluted. The cast does an admirable job with the material they are given, but in general I don't think they were given enough license for us to truly understand their characters (except Diaz's Malkina). For example, the audience is supposed to believe that Fassbender's The Counselor and Cruz's Laura are madly in love with each other, but it would appear from their scenes together in the film that their relationship is purely sexual and there are really no hints of a deeper relationship. But as I said the cast does a good job for what they are given. Except for Cameron Diaz. Her character is the most realized in the film, but Diaz looks like she's just reading her lines from cue cards off screen, with little intensity or passion that a part like this requires.Other things to be said for the film include it's amazing cinematography as well as it's fantastic score by Daniel Pemberton. I will also give props to the legendary Cormac McCarthy for the many lyrical monologues sprinkled throughout the film that really do stir the soul when listened to. But perhaps his prose would have been better served in novel form rather than as a screenplay.",The Counselor
218,glennataylor,SPOILERS Worst movie I've seen in some time.,3,28 October 2013,"Really a bad movie. I think more than anything it was weak writing. Stretched scenes that get the point across after 15 seconds, then drone on for 3 min. or more. Unnecessarily violent deaths, graphic, horrible deaths. Obtuse plot development with no strong characters. There was no protagonist in the movie, just a bunch of empty shallow characters that you feel no empathy for. OK, it's a drug movie, a world full of shallow, greedy people and riddled with death. But this is a MOVIE, you are supposed to identify with SOMEONE-ANYONE. Cruz is a beautiful person, gorgeous, sweet, but honestly she can't act. Fassbender surprised me, he was weak in Prometheus, but strong acting couldn't salvage such a weak character. I guess you are amused by Javier, but again, he is just as weak by the end of the movie, and stupid. No precaution when they know they are being hunted by the Cartel?

DANGEROUSLY DECEIVING!,6,20 February 2018,"When I first heard about ""THE COUNSELOR"" during its early production phase back in (2011) nobody could of been more overjoyed than I was about the (2013) theatrical release. Powerfully flooded with an exceptional A list cast along with one of my all time favorite directors, the one and only visionary extraordinaire Ridley Scott, it had Oscar Gold written all over it.
But with powerful dialogue & superior acting taking precedent over Michael Bay type action sequences it didn't sit so well with the majority of film critics and nationwide audiences, ultimately receiving an abundance amount of negative reviews.
From the opening scene legendary filmmaker Ridley Scott sends a crystal clear message to its viewer that in this violently seductive, harrowing nightmarish roller coaster ride ""ANYTHING GOES.""

We do not need details of who, what , where or when regarding the drug deal, we only need to see the greed and the evil it leads to, play out.Yes the dialogue is metaphorical, gloriously so, and the actors deliver this as it was intended to be delivered by the writer and the director. This dialogue is superb in setting the ominous tone for the film, we do not need to know who is picking up what and delivering to whom, we only need to know that it didn't happen and somebody has to pay, pay a price beyond imagining! While there are moments of amusement, it is a deadly serious morality tale that does not play out to our long established preconceptions. Decisions today can make for impossible decisions and terrifying consequences tomorrow.Do not judge, rate or review this film within the traditional confines of typical Hollywood movies, as it barely applies, maybe it does to the star power but not to the content nor the execution.I really cannot wait to see this movie again, I give this an 8/10.",The Counselor

At a minimum I would expect an excellent movie. This movie has an excellent pedigree in the scriptwriter, all actors, and director; however, the movie makes no sense. Neither the plot nor the characters are explained and are very poorly developed: we as an audience have no understanding of who the characters are and why they do what they do. At the end of the movie, we would expect an explanation, but there is nothing to explain what we have just seen--just lots of questions with no answers. It seems, the movie is about a drug deal gone south, but you have no idea who masterminded the deal, who plotted the drug deal heist, or why all of this was done.

It is packed with powerful acting and social commentary on the things that drive people in modern America.However... this movie is bleak. I mean, REALLY bleak. If you need plots that resolve and/or result in some kind of uplift, this is not the movie for you.

I've never heard so many utterly mind shattering conversation out of any films, other than Roman Polanski's MacBeth. Most of the reviews described this film as "" non-linear"", or ""boring"", or ""pseudo-intellectual"", none of which are true. Quite the opposite, actually. Scenes after scenes of the most amazing dialogues that really rattles my mind. And the cinematography was breath-taking. I've never been a fan of Cameron Diaz but she really shined in her role.

235,HomeinIndiana,Poetic Justice,10,30 October 2013,"The Counselor is a beautiful, mesmerizing film with gorgeous dialog and top performances. The plot structure is classic film noir: the protagonist becomes entangled in something that is too big for him, he is powerless before his enemies, and he is destroyed. Fassbender, who is always capable of dominating the screen, deliberately dials back to a passive presence here, limited (unlike the other characters) to one-line responses--one of the most powerless of all film noir protagonists, even in words. Yet from this he creates an indelible character: already corrupt (there are plenty of indications of this), blinded by his own arrogance, and perhaps driven by an inner desire for self-destruction (why else does he keep piling up the debts, until his back is ""against the wall?""), he finds punishment and annihilation. The other actors are all top notch. Penelope Cruz becomes a victim we care about. Javier Bardem and Brad Pitt are flamboyant and funny. Cameron Diaz is appropriately chilling. Ruben Blades, Bruno Ganz, and Rosie Perez each have wonderful scenes (all with Fassbender). John Leguizamo and Dean Norris have a darkly comic conversation, one of many moments of humor in the film. Even the drug/sewage truck has its own personality, in the form of a theme that plays whenever it appears (given the cheeriness of the theme, another example of dark humor). The Counselor, with its many quotable lines and startling occurrences, its layers of meaning, and its terrifying foreshadowing, is a brilliant, satisfying film.",The Counselor

Every weekend there's nothing but ""mindless entertainment"" playing at the theaters. People complain about this. They write reviews that go something like ""it was what I expected, mindless entertainment."" Yet these movies make hundreds of millions of dollars so my only options are teen novels turned into movies, comic books turned into movies, 80's movies turned into crappier movies or high budget sci-fi movies that usually miss the mark.This sub-culture(I refer to them as)of movies are my all time favorite and I get one every couple years now. The 90's movies were my favorite. Some of these would obviously include Pulp Fiction, Boondock Saints, Natural Born Killers, Thursday, Trainspotting, etc. Then I liked Requiem for a Dream, Departed, No Country for Old Men, Spun, Savages, Domino, etc. Drive has been my favorite one in a long time. There's a few I'm leaving out for sure.The point I'm making is if you do not like these type of fantasy, sub- culture, everyone is bad, noir-ish, violent drug movies then stop watching them and writing bad reviews.

But this one seems clear - the script is horribly pretentious and murky. I don't mind that characters don't know what's going on - that's like real life. But as the viewer, I want to know what's going on. (My favorite movie is Blood Simple, in which almost nobody actually knows what is going on, or even who is dead and who is alive.)The whole PREMISE of The Counselor is contrived: we spend hours with this guy, in scenes where he is almost ALWAYS conversing with someone, and NO ONE ever utters his name? Not even his girlfriend/wife? What does this conceit add to the dramatic art of the work? The author is way too in love with men who are ghostly presences....I never thought I'd hate a sex scene, but the 2 in the film did nothing for me. They add nothing to character development or plot, nor were they very sexy (in Diaz' scene with in (and on) the Ferarri, I only knew what she was doing because Bardem was describing it to Fassbender while we watched a flashback. On the other hand, there's a sunbathing scene in which the amoral animal played by Diaz gets just a little bit touchy-feely with the shy, almost-virginal character played by Cruz. Now THAT would have been interesting, dramatically. To watch one of these characters ensnare another would have been an improvement. Demonstrating the adage about the ""gun in Act One, corpse in Act 3"", we have one character killed using a novel weapon that was completely gratuitous. The time taken to describe it to us earlier, and then show it to us later, was time wasted.Some of the scenes in which a character goes on and on philosophically have the small virtue of at least fitting the plot: someone has sought someone's help, or asked someone's opinion, and they get it, albeit at great length.

240,paparidgeback,"extended, unrated non-theatrical version",9,26 November 2014,"At 2hrs 18 mins Ridley Scott's direction of Cormac McCarthy's original screenplay strikes many viewers as needlessly lagging, with windy homilies and improbable departures into existential nihilistic commentaries interspersed with enough eliminative materialist banalities to make Carlos Castaneda blanch. Despite commendable performances by Michael Fassbinder, Cameron Diaz, Penelope Cruz, Javier Bardem and Brad Pitt (surprise), there's not much here to hold the attention of Hollywood-popcorn audiences accustomed to paper-thin dialogue and standard portions of gratuitous nudity, automotive mayhem, calculable doses of violence and lots n' lots of directorial hand-holding lest anyone in the theater glance away for an instant to answer a txt and miss catching a critical plot point, thus spoiling Guardians of the Galaxy forever.Does The Counselor's plot (""A lawyer finds himself in over his head when he gets involved in drug trafficking""), like its drug cartel-inspired predecessors, come across as contrived or unrealistic? Not for a second: Ridley Scott (Scott also directed Alien, Blade Runner, Thelma & Louise, Gladiator and Black Hawk Down) builds Michael Fassbender's desperate predicament with a masterly combination of cinematic color, cultural textures and layers of psychological brush strokes and presents us with an uneasy glimpse into the deadly world of narco-egos acting in predictable accordance with the impersonal physics of greed, revenge and interminable concupiscence.The Counselor's tagline reminds us: Sin Is A Choice.Is the film slow-moving? Compared to situational comedy TV and ""Dumb and Dumber"" reenactments on youtube, yes. Does the deliberate pacing and the lack of nudity inhibit the movie's plot or interfere with its resolution? No ... or at least, it doesn't for audiences old enough to remember when mainstream films lacked any nudity or graphic sexual couplings and painstakingly constructed story and characters instead. The Counselor is solid, accomplished story-telling and Scott rewards our perseverance with a good swift kick in the pants by delivering what turns out to be a total doozy of a story.At times The Counselor may occasionally feel like it's moving with the sulking acceleration of a steam locomotive heading uphill on an icy track, but the deliberate pacing is a prerequisite for achieving the emotional momentum necessary for transporting us through The Counselor's desert landscapes of violence and across its mountains of cash, lust and unbridled avarice.",The Counselor
241,Cyorel,Not very clear...,4,27 January 2020,"Indeed, some people wonder about the interest of a lot of things in the movie (like this cheetahs story... The couple is simply a fan of these animals, as it is the case and the fashion in the Emirates, if I'm not mistaken... it's not a big deal).
After all, in all films, you can be scandalized by a lot of things that are useless in the story, but which are there: why does what's-his-name wear glasses? What's the point of Bidule smoking? What's the point of Trukmuch wearing a blue suit in this scene,... whatever.No, the real concern is that I really didn't understand everything.
The main point of the story is that the lawyer goes into the drug trade... Yeah, well, it's very, very, very implied. I didn't even understand what his role in it was in the first place, by the way.
The only thing that comes out is that when a cartel guy involved in the transfer of merchandise is killed, this poor neophyte drug lawyer is accused of being responsible for it under the pretext that he knows the guy, for having gotten him out of jail a few days earlier for speeding...
Uh then already a cartel that looks so powerful is not even bothered to get the correct information telling them who is responsible... even if, however, in the end, the person responsible ends up getting killed too. So the Grand Cartel shoots the person in charge without knowing who's in charge... ?
Strange cartel.
And everything else is a bit like that: confused, (too) implicit, but filled, indeed, by a lot of philosophical speeches about life lessons.Maybe I'm the one who got too used to having films that are much more accessible to the general public from Ridley and the shovelful of actors that make up this cast.",The Counselor

This is a Christian movie about choice and consequences in a fallen world - sad to see, that the decadence of our time has left the viewers disconnected to the wisdom of the gospel and the spirit on witch the west was build. The Counsellor is at the end a movie about the downfall of the west, by greed, decadence - and open home being ravished by the evil that men do.

I don't dislike her as an actress, but it was clear that she basically phoned this one in. Barely any effort. 3. The small bits of horrifying violence (in particular, a scene in the last quarter of the movie) was unnecessary and actually served to further diminish my opinion of the film.4.

Javier Bardem did an exceptional job of coming across as both street smart and vulnerable. Fassbender's scene when he received the DVD was exceptional. You could literally see the wave of emotions hit him prior to his breakdown. The only aspect I felt was unrealistic was the relationship between Fassbender and Cruz. He simply didn't convey the sense of urgency when things went south. I realize he tried to remain cool for her sake, but his level of calm was Bond-like. I don't blame his delivery. I blame the writing. Diaz was both sexy and cruel. Her line ""I don't believe the truth has a temperature"" was awesome. She delivered her lines with that belief. I won't bother getting into the ""what was meant by this line or scene"" dialog. Anyone can pick a movie apart line for line. Taken as a whole, it was a well-done movie.

The writer himself is a brilliant novelist, but just because you're an acclaimed writer in your own genre doesn't mean you can write scripts. I'm sure the script was a great read but the movies are a show me don't tell me genre, and the dialogue definitely felt 'novelish' which in film comes across pretentious because I think no matter how brilliant people are, more often than not they speak differently than they write. Unless they're delivering a speech which is what all the characters were doing, delivering speeches rather than having normal conversations. You would think that's just basic, but even an acclaimed writer can miss that.This is like the movie Carnage all over again, one of my favorite playwrights who is a Pulitzer prize winning author wrote a script for Carnage which she wrote as a play, it had a great cast, good director but the same fate followed.Moral of the story for Hollywood, if your author is well acclaimed but has never written a script, most likely his script will leave much to be desired no matter who's directing it or who's acting in it.

Lets not forget about the fake Sheriff that takes out the pickup truck from 100 yards with an Uzi like he was shooting a mini-gun....stupid. Cameron Diaz rubbing on the windshield, the stupid cheetahs, all the heads getting chopped off! Actually, the only cool part was when the Bolito finally shows up at the end...now that was kinda cool.

An outstanding lineup of Hollywood's finest, so I ask; were they duped? Did they see what we saw in the trailer before watching the movie? Because it certainly wasn't representative of the Movie (Typical these days). I can honestly say that this movie was absolutely average at best and only achieved such height of a rating because of the star studded cast. The general story line of a drug deal gone bad, resulting in Cartel chaos isn't a new one yet had all the potential to create a blockbuster.Sadly the screenplay simply dragged and focused so much on the dialogue between the characters it forgot that this is a movie! The action didn't really show up. Similarly I thought in Brad Pitt's ""Killing Them Softly"". Dean Norris (Hank) from ""Breaking Bad"" was in one scene!

255,bosozoku,Beautiful but unsatisfying,5,28 October 2013,"No spoilers here, but I think there are two major flaws in The Counselor. The most serious flaw is in the writing. We never really know why the Counselor character does what he does. What's his motivation? Greed? Gambling debts? Child support? Boredom? Deathwish? All of the above? We don't know, and without that crucial detail we don't really understand the Counselor character. The audience is kept at arm's length, shut out of the main character's inner life. We are never pulled into his world. And that kills off any chance of building emotional truth in the film.The second major flaw is in the editing. Yes, there is always room for good actors to show their chops in the occasional big scene. The key word being ""occasional."" But several such big acting scenes just feel too long. All the main actors and several of the supporting actors are given at least one long speech with keen observations about the human condition and/or heavy emoting. Too few of which contribute to moving the plot forward or enhancing the overall story. Some of these big acting scenes could have been shortened or cut entirely without hurting the narrative or character development (such as it is.) And the time saved could have been used in other ways to advance the story or add more depth to the characters or provide more cinematic texture to the film. Instead, we sit through quite a few stagey and long-winded expositions that don't help the movie.On the surface, The Counselor is a thriller. But it lacks the clear motivations and efficient crispness of a good thriller. Yes, Ridley Scott's attention to that surface gives us a beautiful looking film, with some gritty and punishing action sequences, and some very good performances by all of the actors.

There was too much character developing with no progress happening with the characters. There was no actual plot. You never find out why he (Fassbender) wants to get into the drug smuggling. There were too many sub-stories going on throughout the film. All in all, this movie was horrible.

This movie rates very highly on my all time top 15 movies. In a time when media and film appeal to those with little to no true appreciation for art and true human nature, this film is a great breath of fresh air. The many themes are powerful. Sex, drugs, and money masquerade as a front for the deeper consequences of greed, desperation, and ignorance. The story, the dialogue, the entire cast, camera work, the music; the silence; everything is synergistic to produce a beautiful symphonic poem of a movie.

If you know the author's work in film then you can expect some recurring themes. The nature of evil, the consequences of choice and free will. Rarely films produce memorable lines of dialog that I take away and dissect word for word to reveal a kernel of visceral Truth. Occasionally films produce imagery so vivid with remarkable characters played by amazing actors that once seen it cannot be unseen. This film does both. Ridley Scott gives life to a screenplay written by writer unequaled in both film and literature. This film is indelible, disturbing, brutal, ugly, and unforgettable.

I read a lot of negative comments on it and even my friends were divided (only some of them loved it) but I'm glad I didn't care, and forget about the stories regarding the difficulties between Scott and MacCarthy or about some inconsistencies. What is special about this movie are in my opinion the dialogues. Acting is terrific, (we all agree on this point) and Ridley Scott knows is jobs like no others, but what is really peculiar about this movie are the lines by McCarthy. It's the new American Tragedy, but also a meditation on human natures (the plural is necessary)or on Nature tout court... if you prefer. Also, it is a social and political pamphlet: The Mexican tank hidden in the darkness of the street, waiting, during the mass meeting near the end of the movie, explains why the fight against the drogue dealers cannot be won easily. It is not a movie one can forget easily: without the ""beloved"" happy ending, no wonder some people didn't like it.

Their job is simply to get the drugs into America to their buyers. They don't sell in America; they just get the drugs smuggled over the border. It's a 50 billion dollar a year business for them. They're not interested in dealing the drugs they smuggle into America in America. They make enough money as is. The Cartel has a good relationship with the Buyer. They sell to him. They make money off him. If a deal goes bad, they have to make sure the blame doesn't fall on them and ruin this business relationship they have with the Buyer. So, they have to act and kill every single suspect to make sure their relationship with the Buyer is not severed. It's in their best interest as businessmen to make sure their business partner in America knows that they will recover any and all stolen loads and have them delivered as planned.The Counsellor is strictly an investor. He puts up money expecting a certain percentage in return. Like any investment, the higher the risk the higher expected return, hence why the Cartel accepts outside money. Let's say the Counsellor shipment gets caught at customs, he gets no return and is out of is original investments. The Counsellor is merely a way for the Cartel to spread risk, it's a business. The Cartel gets no return anyway. They're not investors. They're suppliers. They supply the drugs and sell them to the Buyer wholesale and then wipe their hands.The Investors invest with the Buyer. In the movie, this is the first time the Counsellor has gotten in on the action. Reiner had tried to bring him in before, but the Counsellor refused. Typically, the Counsellor role, as a lawyer, is to launder the money. Before this deal, the Counsellor only sold his services. This time he wants in because of greed and his ""back is against the wall"", especially after going to Amsterdam to buy an extremely expensive ring he could not really afford.The Middle Man runs the deal, from border to Chicago. Evidently he gets paid 20M when the goods arrive in Chicago. The Cartel offers full service from border to destination. When the Cartel recovers the goods, they eventually arrive to destination and the Middle Man gets paid his commission. By skipping town, he double crosses everyone except the Predator (Malkina). Malkina has the role of a predator higher up in the chain. She is not as strong as a pack of lions/lionesses but she stalked her prey quietly and went in for the kill when the pack wasn't noticing. When she is discovered, she runs away. She double crosses everyone; the Counsellor has no official role in the deal. He is just road-kill. When Malkina have sex with the Ferrari, she shows she is self-sufficient and doesn't even need a man in her life. Far from being misogynist, Malkina ends up being the top predator, cleverer than anyone else. Reiner: Are you really that cold? Malkina: The truth has no temperatureSimple moral of the story:If you're an insanely good looking, high powered attorney who lives in a place straight out of metropolitan home, who also drives a 200K Bentley continental GT Convertible, and is engaged to not only a beautiful ""10"" who is devoted to you, loves you but also goes to church, wouldn't inquire about the price you paid for her rock and is not a vapid gold digger, don't get greedy and do a drug deal with the Cartel.Quote from Ruben Blades (Kingpin): ""Reflective men often find themselves at a certain remove from the realities of life. () You are now at the crossing and you want to choose, but there is no choosing. () When you cease to exist, the world that you have created will also cease to exist. () I would urge you to see the truth of your situation Counsellor. () That is my advice. It is not for me to say what you should have done. Or not done.

268,ypomoni13,Wasted Talent,1,24 November 2013,"There was nothing for me to like about this movie. The story evolves around a Counsellor and the people surrounding him. For reasons unbeknown to us he decides to go into the drug business, and pseudo-intellectual existential dialogues between the protagonists ensue, with the main focus being on greed and how sexual everything appears to them. Cheetahs chasing jackrabbits is sexual, a yellow Ferrari is so sexual that Diaz' character decides to make-out with it (yes, you read that correctly). The Counsellor is constantly being counselled on life and it's meaning by philosophical drug-dealers and cartel members. The tediousness of these overdrawn, often repetitive and rather self-indulged exchanges make the film feel so ill paced. The chemistry between the two main couples (Fassbender-Cruz, Bardem-Diaz) was non-existent. The characters are hardly developed. Were we suppose to empathise with the Counsellor? The acting was NOT good. The ultimate attraction to this film, for me, was the cast who in it's majority has seldom - if ever - let me down. And yet, here, even they were, to put it mildly, not on top form. The emphasis had been given on the aforementioned dialogue, something that was more obvious when the main plot of the film became increasingly convoluted and thus hard to follow.

Three words that most describe the visual beauty (in its bleakness), the tension and the brutality in this movie...The Counsellor. From start to finish, Cormac McCarthy's script never takes a breath. The dialog is incredible, some of the best I've ever seen. In a time of films where CGI takes front and center and real acting skill is thrown out of the window to incorporate more time for action, movies like this are a forgotten relic. Until now. There is something so very gorgeously poetic about the dialog in this movie, and also to how each scene plays out because of it and the tension. The actors all shined, especially when really needed, filling the screen with an ocean of Shakespearean themes, set pieces and morals. We thank you, Cormac, for this event of a lifetime. The intensity was massively important and engrossing, and the story was paced excellently! There are severe shocks in this movie, where the brutal violence is needed, but is certainly not overdone. Ridley Scott's directing is stunning, from the dim to the sunlit surroundings, to the flash and colorful characters, but these were just a small fraction of this movie's soul. The directing made it very realistic, sometimes going unnoticed because of the rich monologues of which the characters would delve into, but it makes the scenes gripping. Michael Fassbender shines as the cocky, clever (but stupid...see the film to understand), slightly arrogant and certainly suave titular role. Javier Bardem is just mesmerizing as the eccentric and witty Reiner. Cameron Diaz delivers perhaps the performance of her career as the dangerous and mysterious Malkina, and even though Penelope Cruz is a very brief maybe even side tracked role in this movie, she delivers a sense of pure innocence to a world of cruelty and darkness.

279,rockenrohl,"A dark, bleak masterpiece about predators - 10/10",10,26 October 2013,"Don't believe the bad reviews here: If you love intelligent, really dark gangster movies, this is definitely one to see.It's so sinister it hurts - but not in an ""in your face"" way, but gradually. McCarthy has written a piece about predators (very eloquent predators - the dialogs, or rather monologues, are a thing of real beauty). And don't let anyone tell you they are not good because nobody talks like this. This is not the point of this movie, anyone who wants a realistic, mindless action thriller is in the wrong movie. These are dark poetic gems, perfectly brought to life on the big screen.The plot is merciless. There's no relief (some great comic relief moments aside, but they leave the viewers as puzzled as the characters in those scenes), the violence is shot in a way that shows you what violence is (it hurts, it's terrible, there is nothing noble about it).The predators (and this is maybe the main theme of this movie) triumph all the way, to the point where it almost physically hurts. Diaz is perfect as the ice cold greedy killer (in big cat tattoos), this is, in my humble opinion, her best work ever. As viewers, we are left as baffled by the predators' moves as are the many innocent bystanders we see again and again (in restaurants, on the streets, in Mexican bars).There are, however, many people with redeeming qualities (if you know and like McCarthy's work, think the ending of ""The Road""). This is where the word ""counselor"" clearly becomes ironic: He does not counsel anyone, he just listens, he gets counsel throughout the movie. And even all the predators (only Diaz is purely evil beyond redemption) have good counsel for him. He just does not listen to anyone, and that is his downfall. Even while he really does his job as counselor, in prison with the perfect Rosie Perez, he just receives orders. There's also the brief, brilliant appearance of Natalie Dormer towards the end - here, we get a brief glimpse of humanity, too. And, of course, we get it in Laura's love (great as Diaz' opposite: Penélope Cruz) - doomed, because the counselor cannot listen.Acting was very, very strong throughout. And visually, the whole thing is a feast, too. Not just because Scott knows what he's doing in every scene.

281,ingbru2,"Great cast, pointless violence",3,1 July 2014,"One wonders why such violent films are made and for whom they are intended. Will some adolescent viewers see messages in the film that can be used to justify future acts of violence against innocent people in schools or shopping malls? No one doubts that in the drug trafficking world there is a great deal of intentional and gratuitous violence. Perhaps this was Ridley Scott's objective. Yet, the slick presentation of violence and the disconnects between various characters involved in its commission lead me to think that Scott was trying combine elements from some of Luis Bunuel's surreal films with some of the hard-core ""noir"" films of the 1940s and 50s. ""Los Olvidados"" meets ""The Big Sleep"".A film like ""No Country for Old Men"" had a great deal of violence but it also had a point that audiences could grasp. Ditto for a much older film ""Kiss Me Deadly,"" with Ralph Meeker or Costa Gravas's 1969 film ""Z"". Even Scott's first major opus ""Aliens"" had a point.""The Counselor"" leaves us quaking as the counselor reacts to the delivery of the disk entitled ""Hola!"" The ""philosophical"" phone conversation between the counselor and the cold, emotionless boss of the cartel is supposed to deliver the ""message"" of the film, but really it is almost incidental to the blood and guts spilled on the screen whether its the counselor's girl friend being dumped in a land fill or the confident American financier strangled by a device placed on his neck by a passing jogger on a London street.

282,iansmyth95,One of the biggest disappointments of the year.,5,29 October 2013,"The Counsellor is easily one of the biggest disappointments in film all year. It just sounded so promising; extremely capable actors, an inventive director, and what seemed like an intriguing story to top it off. So why did it fail so miserably?The answer lies within the screenplay. Written by Cormac McCarthy (who wrote the novels The Road and No Country for Old Men), The Counsellor's screenplay was absolutely brutal. Sadly, it wasn't even lazy writing that ruined it, it was the fact that it was essentially written as a novel. Let me explain.Now, I haven't read McCarthy's novels. However, it's very clear that a novelist wrote the screenplay for this movie. The entire movie was essentially what could be looked at as a word for word adaption of what an imaginary ""The Counsellor"" novel could have been. The awful, unrealistic lines that came out of the character's mouths didn't fit the role they were portraying at all. Sentences such as ""the truth has no temperature"" were cringe-worthy to hear, especially out of the mouth of the very capable Cameron Diaz. There were too many examples of such lines to write out here, but the majority of what came out of character's mouths were very similar. It just...isn't what people would say, unless maybe they worked on a set of a Shakespearian play. And when the lines don't work, neither do the actors. Everyone (exluding possibly Michael Fassbender, who was given much less hollow Shakespearian lines (lets call them McCarthers), just acted hollow and rigid. Rightfully so too, as their characters were given no more substance and therefore the actors had nothing to work with. Did we care about any of the characters? No. Did we understand why The Counsellor wanted in on the drug trade even though he was already rich? No. Did we get any character development throughout the near two hour film? No. Why did The Counsellor even enter the drug trade, knowing that his wife could wind up becoming a target if things every turned ugly? It was confirmed later in the movie how much he truly loved her, obviously more than any money he would earn, so why put her at risk for a few extra bucks you don't already have? His motivations made no sense. The plot itself was fairly straightforward, except leaving the theatre I found myself alarmingly confused as to what happened because there was so many tasteless McCarthers being stuffed down the character's throats to try and figure out why the characters were doing what they were doing and what they were going to do.The Counsellor wasn't bad in all aspects, though. The cinematography was very good, as was the editing and sound editing. The sound of bullets being shot on a desolate road was chillingly real, as was the sound of those who had their heads removed. Visually, the film pretty much hit the spot. The actors did what they could with the script too, but I doubt anyone could have really done any better.It really seems like the team behind The Counsellor went into it wanting to turn a drug trade plot into something Shakespearian and hollow in the sense that it's a tragedy. For a good example on how to do this, watch the entire series of Breaking Bad. For a good example on how to try to do this and fail miserably, watch (or try to watch) The Counsellor. It's so sad to see so much talent and money go to waste, but sometimes these films are important to have so the generation of emerging new filmmakers know what not to do when crafting their dramas.5/10",The Counselor

The story lines are unconnected and many things unexplained and as a viewer you just lose interest and don't really care about what happens as everything is so disjointed. Brad Pitt only has a small part but no doubt earned big bucks to add his name to the credits and the under use of Cruz is a missed opportunity, there is little that can be said that is positive other than some half decent fight scenes and a interesting love scene involving Diaz and a car, yes a car, which has to be seen to be believed but my advice would be to give this nonsense a wide berth.",The Counselor

Again, while it is not a Schwarzenegger or Stallone actioner, it's more subtle, mostly, asking the viewer to trade places with any or all of the characters in a What If scenario.I felt the cast did a fine job with the rolls they were given, though Pitt may have been under-used. I think Scott did a great job putting the viewer in touch with what it means to get into an illicit, though lucrative, business and dealing with the mother of all stock market crashes while the characters themselves were in for a bit of a moment.In spite of what other, more esoteric reviewers feel, this piece is far worthier than a bucket of bad popcorn.",The Counselor

This simply is a self-indulgent film (self-indulgent by the writer), with actors badly delivering unintelligible lines of philosophic dialogue with neither rhyme nor reason as to how they got there and what their motives are. This is the sort of thing you would expect to have to sit through, not too willingly, when you have a very good friend who is taking screenplay classes and has to do an obscure showcase. Most students, if not all, refrain from applying a Hollywood budget, getting Ridley Scott to direct and having Brad Pitt et al in these showcases though and maybe McCarthy should have thought twice about having his screenplay debut in such a fashion and kept to the more traditional avenue of a few friends in a small theatre.

A prime example of this is Assassins creed I went to see it twice and although I understood most of it the first time anyway it made even more sense the second time round. But I'm sad to say The Counsellor was a whole different kettle of fish. The plot is bleak, the dialogue although clever at times is down right confusing and doesn't explain what is going on properly at all in certain scenes. It's like they are talking in riddles and the plot is hard enough to follow as it is. I like to be challenged at times when watching a movie but this is taking it a bit too far. Characters just pop up and it doesn't explain who they are or what side they are on. It pains me to give a Michael Fassbender movie a negative review because I genuinely love the man & his talent.

Ridley Scott respected the storytelling of Mcarthy in such a way I can only assume the screenplay was almost untouched. The movie played like a novel. The character development and especially the dialogue felt like it was ripped from the pages of an unpublished Mcarthy book.On a raw level, this film tells the story of a lawyer who embraces greed and decides to take a path which leads him into a world of violence and deception. Masked by a world of glamor and glitter, his vision and decisions are clouded and he is unable to accept what consequences might be in store for him.To look deeper into the film it is filled with symbolism. Greed, betrayal, life and death. Death has no meaning. This is a concept Mcarthy incorporated heavily in ""No Country For Old Men"".I expect this movie to do horribly at the box office. I attended a midnight screening alongside ""Bad Grandpa"". ""Bad Grandpa"" had a full theater. A crowd of mostly men in their early twenties. (I should note that I am also in my early twenties).

It's not the substance of the speeches that palls but their smugness and their length. The musings of one too many cameo characters on the consequences of a choice to seek profit in crime become much more gratuitous than the highly effective, vividly explicit, and powerfully etched scenes of violence.The problem addressed in the script by Cormac McCarthy seems broadly this: In what kind of world do we live where the kind of clinical violence routinely practised by the drug cartels is possible? It's a theme McCarthy addressed in No Country For Old Men, but in The Counsellor from the point of view of much less sympathetic main character, not a small town sheriff at the end of a long career of peacekeeping, but a sleekly urbane young lawyer with extravagant tastes.Like No Country For Old Men, The Counselor shocks and repels on first viewing.

Editing is a complete nightmare, Cormac's dialogue is a blur, its like a damn speed reading competition, the conversation between the motorcycle guy and that random lady was fingernails on a chalkboard to a native Texan, no one on earth talks like that. It wants to be dense and wordy but it goes by too quick to be understood properly.At its heart its trying to be an extremely grim philosophical crime thriller, in the same vein that No Country for Old men is an extremely grim crime thriller, but the weight of the words is under-cut by the fact they edited out every damn second of silence, this movie cant wait for you, if it stops to think it all unravels.Which brings us to Diaz. Its.....complicated, I can see what she was going for and I think she mostly pulls it off, its an extremely challenging role, and there's few believable man hunters in the game but I think a subtler hand would have been better, she over-sells a little too much and it's clunky and bizarre, not helping an already clunky and disjointed movie.Having said all of that, maybe that's the point.

Scott might be good at TV commercials but as far as movie making is concerned its thumbs down on this one. The plot is 70% dialogue, most of it pointless in its confusion – meaning: I had no idea what anybody was discussing most of the time -- even the almost pointless explanation about the quality of diamonds: ""Looking for the flaw"" from Bruno Gans did nothing to add to the plot. Dialogue in screenplays – ""Keep it short and to the point, one page (one minute) max."" This is something Mr Scott ignored totally. Dialogue is something the viewer hears but doesn't subconsciously take it as the 100% truth, for the simple reason that people tell lies; this logic follows when watching movies. The action, however, is believable as it is visible, dialogue is left open to interpretation and as we know, opinions differ, so, in movies, all we have is action -- as dialogue is only there to inform, amuse and confuse. In this so-called movie, apparently one money-greedy guy orders drugs from the ""Cartel"". The goods are transported to a depot in the USA for collection, but, the drugs are ""stolen"" – twice - which means ""He"" can't sell and he can't pay the cartel. There is total confusion as to who finishes up with the goods, and the Cartel (I think this is the point Scott was trying to get across) make a point of punishing people for their mistakes and other people's wrong- doings, as if there was some justification for doing so. No thrills, no suspense, not even Carmen Diaz could raise the standard (and certainly not mine) of this drivel. This means I add another director to my ""caution"" list. In other words a waste of viewing time.",The Counselor
312,arteminimal,"Brutal, meditative, and smart. The surprise of the year.",10,23 November 2013,"I write this as a Mexican living near the border, meaning, as a direct witness of the drug war. I loved Heli, and I loved the Counsellor, this is why.I went to the cinema to see ""The Counselor"" expecting to watch a crime movie almost as entertaining as the old school Scorcece. It ended up being a fantastic and sublime meditation about the process of dehumanization that drug trafficking detonates (I'm using the word 'sublime' here in its Kantian definition: Any phenomena that surpasses our imagination and make us watch in anguish or awe). Fantastic dialogs, which although unlikely because we will never find lawyers and killers as poetic as the ones depicted on this movie (Cormac McCarthy, after all, is a great writer) summarize and propose precise reflections on how little we really understand about the violence and brutality of drug trafficking. It's not cryptic dialogs as some suggest, you just have to pay close attention to the details.Adding that the violence displayed in the film is unbelievably cruel considering that this is a AAA movie ( big budget, great director, big-name casting, famous writer, etc), this become the most pleasant surprise I've watched this year. And the most politically incorrect: You never submit a AAA's audience to this kind of dialog and cruelty, yet Scott risk it, with great results.I do not recommend it as a film that intents to be realistic. Scott never wanted to do that. The intention of this film is to be a poetic articulation of the distance between humanity and inhumanity and the process that transforms one into the other.10/10 The movie of the year for me.I don't care the critics are destroying it. This is one of those moves that will make me seem like a hipster (Maybe I am one): People are simply not getting it.",The Counselor
313,anaclaudia-7,What a master-piece,9,20 November 2013,"I'm amazed. 'The Counselor' might seem a bit daring 'cause of the plot and give you the (wrong) idea that Cameron Diaz, Brad Pitt, Michael Fassbender, Javier Bardem and Penélope Cruz are just names to call more moviegoers increasing the box office.Cameron Diaz as a perfect roll on the film. She's daring, she's sexy, she's bossy, she's stunning, she's powerful and demanding, she's smart and courageous, she's a doll and a great bitch at the same time. She's perfect! Penélope Cruz doesn't appear as much as I was expecting but I guess I prefer this way.I've read on a movie critic that Michael Fassbender's roll wasn't that great but I don't understand where the doubt is. Fine, I agree... 'The Counselor' isn't the most suitable title for the movie, not even to nickname Fassbender's roll, because he should have been called 'The Advised', but that doesn't make his participation worst... for the contrary. He's just that sexy guy that thinks a lot and gives attention to the woman he loves.Javier Bardem is the man, as usual, but Brad Pitt is equivalent in this film. Two real gentlemen, the bad guys!What I really loved about this movie that the majority is going to hate, for sure, was the speeches. 'The Counselor' isn't made of cheap lines and sh*t-chat comments, all of the dialogs are art. A complex paradox that makes you think about every line.It's very intense and worthy to see.",The Counselor
314,jbart-12,I expected more from such an all-star cast!,3,27 November 2013,"Hello everyone,I went and watched The Counselor tonight, quite looking forward to watching a film with such an amazing list of actors and actresses. My opinion of the film, now that I'm home in my nice warm house, does not reflect the same enthusiasm with which I entered the cinema. The start pulled me in, showing the cast in their respective roles and environments. Slowly but surely we got into the film itself, we got to know the characters slightly and the plot began to form. I must say at this point, that I had hoped to gain a greater insight into the character of The Counselor. Who is he? Who was he to the other characters? I'm not sure if this is something I missed but usually I find it easy to pick up a story (even if this is right at the end of a film). I did learn that he was a lawyer, but there was no counseling happening, apart from the Matrix-like philosophical conversations between some of the characters. I mean no disrespect to The Matrix, however, as these conversations seemed to make no sense to the film.With this story line I would have expected it to be one of those films that goes straight to DVD. I feel the actresses and actors have been wasted in these roles and I would probably recommend and hope that anyone with the desire to watch this film read this review first, then decide against it. Or if you're really eager wait for DVD.",The Counselor

The movie suggests it's maybe because he bails a cartel biker from jail at the behest of his mother...so what.Long scenes of pretentious dialogue that goes no where nor explains much, no scenes that show what actually happened vs what you see.How does a 5 minute scene with the Counselor buying a diamond ring for his wife add any value to the story?A sex scene that add no value with Diaz doing the splits on Ferrari is just weird.Lots of big plot holes requiring explanations or fill in scenes that never arrive leaving the audience wondering.The final scenes says it all.

317,andreasschultz,A successful art film,8,24 November 2013,"""The Counselor"" is Ridley Scotts newest film and has been met with literally every rating available. It is understandable that audiences the world over would ponder the strange composition of dialogue and use of overly graphic violence. Some viewers may even find it drowns under the weight of it's own script and misinterpret this brave attempt as a failed action film. I call it a successful art film. We're introduced to the main character, throughout the film known only as ""The Counselor"", a successful lawyer who through questionable friendships decides to go into the drug dealing business in an attempt to maintain his lavish lifestyle. The deal, however, goes awry and the counselor quickly finds himself on the run. What at first glance seems like a pretty cool action thriller turns out to be a philosophical look at the consequences of bad decisions and learning to live with mistakes. Each sequence of dialogue is complex and reflects the cinematography in a pretty unusual way. It gives a socially realistic and artistic feel, but lose younger audiences in the process. Especially the opening and closing scenes of the movie are exceptionally shot and testaments to the bravery of Ridley Scott. The movie also implements the use of symbolism in the form of colors and make up, which seems a bit obvious compared to the complexity of the rest of the film. It seems almost insulting to the audiences when Cameron Diaz, who is often referred to as a ""hunter"" and a ""cheetah"" throughout the film is dressed up with claw-like nails and a cheetah tattoo down her back. Even though they don't leave much of the symbolism to the imagination, it gives an unusual and cool feeling that draws you into this world of fast cars, women, drugs and nightclubs. Very unrealistic but unlike anything I've ever seen. The film is beautifully shot. The ""closeness"" of each shot seems to draw you through the screen and right into the room with the characters. You feel close to the counselor and care about his struggles and problems, as he tries to navigate his way out of the issues he's made for himself. It is the constant guessing of what will happen to our hero that keeps the audiences interested and on the edge of their seats, but also the moral struggles, self realization and moral redemption he must face. You want a happy ending, and it is that hope that keeps your attention. Otherwise the movie would merely be a series of extremely graphic violence and pointless dialogue.As most people know by now, successful novelist Cormac McCarthy has written the script. As several of his books have been made into successful film, it is only natural he would make the transition to screenwriter. It is, however, obvious that it is not his niche. Most of the lines are very long and complex and would have probably worked much better as a book. Not thereby saying it doesn't work great as a film, because it definitely does. It's just not what you would expect when you watch the trailer or see the poster. The movie operates on a much deeper level and explores profound subjects about life, death and consequences.Needless to say the acting is excellent. Michael Fassbender who's become one of the most ""in demand"" actors in Hollywood delivers the performance of a lifetime as The Counselor. He simply owns the character and works wonders with a script I imagine have been difficult to get into character with. The same goes for Brad Pitt who doesn't really have anything to prove. He plays ""Westray"", an ice-cold drug runner and business partner of the counselor. It's a shame that his combined screen time doesn't exceed more than 20 minutes or so, because the character is really interesting and probably the coolest in the movie. Javier Bardem is absolutely hilarious as ""Reiner"", a flamboyant club owner and drug dealer who brings some much needed light humor to the table. His scenes are very funny and give you pause to breathe through the waves of dialogue. As much as I love Brad Pitt, Javier Bardem and Michael Fassbender, I find it necessary to note how utterly ridiculous Cameron Diaz is. It is impossible for her to carry this ice queen of a character and what should have been an intimidating and dangerous femme fatale ends up being a complete fiasco and a parody of itself. You look at her and can't think anything but ""There's Something About Mary"". I also heard Angelina Jolie was supposed to play her role, which would have been 1 million times better. I'm not questioning Cameron Diaz's acting skills, but she should probably stick to what she knows, which is comedies.To summarize, ""The Counselor"" is a very deep, very well played movie with several philosophical aspects put into a modern setting. Sadly it's been marketed as an action thriller in an attempt to reach a wider target audience. It's unfair to judge it on that background because I find this movie revolutionizing in terms of genre. It's unlike anything I've ever seen before and works as it is; an art film.",The Counselor
318,Wayne1921,Perfection!,10,30 March 2014,"One reviewer quipped that The Counselor is ""not for the average movie-goer"". The ""average movie-goer"" probably enjoys toilet humor, sophomoric dialog, and endless, often pointless action scenes piled one on top of the next, ad nauseam. So, I agree, if you fit that category, this film is not for you. On the other hand, if you are among the diminishing number of movie-goers who actually enjoys deeply portentous dialog (this is a GOOD thing), first-rate acting, and a story line leading to a denouement that that will leave you wanting to see this film again and again, then this is a film for you. It contains (but not by design) probably one of the most effective ""anti-drug"" messages since ""Traffic""; but more interestingly, it is so well told that I sincerely hope you ignore reviewers here who don't agree with me that it is a Ridley Scott masterpiece. 10/10.",The Counselor
319,Scribemonger1,No Country for Old Film Makers,2,1 December 2013,"I went into this movie with high expectations, having thoroughly enjoyed 2007's ""No Country For Old Men,"" based on the novel by Cormack McCarthy. This time however, Mr McCarthy (80) was the screenwriter, not the writer of a novel on which the movie was based, and oh, what a difference it made. Perhaps the choice of Ridley Scott (76) as director was not the best either - with this movie he emphatically continues the decline that started with 2010's ""Robin Hood."" I soon found myself gazing around the cinema during some of the lengthy, shallow dialogue, pondering the existential question: ""Why are we all enduring this?"" As the movie progressed I began to eagerly await the action sequences, hoping to extract some welcome relief and illumination, only to find that they had been already signposted in garish verbal detail about 45 minutes before: ""Oh Westray (Brad Pitt) is being garrotted by a mechanical device in the middle of the street... exactly the way Reiner (Javier Barem) described it in such explicit detail earlier... riiight.""Brad Pitt, by the way, is basically an older version of the character he played in ""Thelma and Louise,"" complete with white cowboy hat, and Cameron Diaz is the requisite cheetah, quite literally, with all the physical markings and the one-dimensional personality to match. By the time the credits were rolling, I was really wishing I could take Reiner's advice to the Counselor (Michael Fassbender) and ""forget the whole story,"" but unfortunately I can't, so here I am, trying to purge it all with this pitiful review. And so I find that just like the Counselor himself, I have to live with a horrendous mistake. It seems that when it comes to film-making, particularly in the case of Messrs. McCarthy and Scott, Hollywood should really be no country for old men.",The Counselor
320,alanhull1,"Literary, Philosophical Drug Thriller",8,10 November 2013,"The Counselor, directed by Ridley Scott, written for the screen by Cormac McCarthy, is a violent, nihilistic, edge-of-your seat drug thriller. It's not a movie for mass consumption, but movie-goers who enjoy films with literary value like No Country for Old Men and lurid subject matter like Breaking Bad and will enjoy the tension and relentless, layered action and imagery. I walked away impressed. The Counselor brings a strong cast that delivers from top to bottom. Michael Fassbender is fantastic and has really established himself as a Heavy-Hitter in Hollywood. Cameron Diaz kills it and is absolutely terrifying.Thematically, it's typical McCarthy, exploring the consequences of greed and a bleak view of the human condition. The themes of greed and violence are not surprising but the exploration of sexuality, as it relates to both the drug world and to man, are interesting, shocking and in one sequence, hilarious. It's more literary than your average popcorn flick. The plot unfolds patiently and is unconventional as far as the storytelling. There is an ominous Chekhov's gun moment early on. There are sequences of dialogue that are deeply rich, both in prose and theme, that demand a second viewing, if not a bit dense the first time through. I loved the ending. Loved it. I actually found myself saying: ""what a great ending"" out loud as it happened on screen. I'm confident the Counselor is going to be on a short list of the best movies of the year for me, but I do appreciate deep, dark, violent movies more than most.",The Counselor
321,philhill-848-500399,This film will be remembered for two reasons only.,4,19 November 2013,"*** Spoiler alert *** I will not mention anything specific in the film, but I will mention in general terms what the two things this film will be remembered for are, without giving any details.Just seen this film as part of a Union freebie. Which means a lot of middle aged men and women came to see this film with very little information about what it would be about, since the trailer tells us nothing. I think most of them were quite shocked when they left the cinema.The storyline unfortunately is unrealistic and becomes confusing towards the end. You kind of know what has happened, but your never quite sure why ?There are a lot of two actor dialogs, that go on and on far too long. They are very deep conversations and although you probably can follow them partially, after a while they become really difficult to understand. This all adds to the confusion surrounding the plot.The two things you will remember from this film are : 1) A very very unusual sex scene (that has nothing to do with the plot really)2) An extremely grotesque murder towards the end. (I've seen a lot of horror and blood and gore flicks in my time, but this scene had me turning my head away from the screen, it was that bad.) So sorry counselor, you had a great cast, but the confusing plot and dialog, the ""over the top"" scenes and at times over-acting, means that this film will probably go down as a major flop.",The Counselor
322,iulia-913-828966,Pretentious drivel,1,2 February 2014,"Michael Fassbender is my new eye candy, so naturally Im excited about anything with him in it. He is still his gorgeous self, and he might even act alright, but this film was really difficult to understand, literally, I hardly understood a few words. My review is based on only about half the movie because thats how much i could stand watching before abandoning it. Javier is terrible, he looks electrocuted. I always thought Cameron looks like The Joker, so alright, she could be his gorgeous sister. Pretty wooden acting from Cruz, and her chemistry with Fassbender was an absolute ZERO. Their opening scene was so bad, Im gonna go into small detail here. So they're lying playfully under the sheets, when he says something like 'Tell me something sexy' Cruz answers, clearly uncomfortable, 'I want you to put your hand up my skirt (or dress)' He says 'Youre not wearing any' to which she replies 'Whats that got to do with anything?' WOW!!! Pretty deep, huh? LOL! Wait its not over yet. Then he asks her again 'Tell me something sexy' to which she replies 'I want you to.....touch me...down there' Lol, that was, I hope you all agree, pretty damn sexy! Then he obliges, then she requests she goes and 'tidies up' and some other minor stuff, and then shes done in like 1 min. Which by the way, were very uncomfortable to watch. Apparently the film is about Fassbender wanting to enter the drug dealing business, honestly I didn't know that, it wasn't obvious to me, I thought he was acting like Javier's lawyer. Maybe they should have spoken more clearly. Everyone's problem seems to be women. Javier Electro cant stop thinking about women and mumbles on and on crap about women, Pitt Black Eye claims he can just leave this all behind, become a monk and mean it, but he wont, because of, yep, women. Cameron Joker also likes women and cars and likes making out with them, the cars I mean (didn't know that was possible, apparently it is, check it out). She also likes cheetas, but other than that I don't know what her problem is, Im hearing she has ulterior motives, well, good luck to her about that. Then there's some other characters but Im unsure of their problems because, as you read earlier, I didn't stay to find out. I couldn't stand Javier, he was so fake and his performance awkward, at one point I honestly thought he was gonna make a pass at Fassbender! Pitt was his usual self, couldn't understand much of what he was mumbling, I'm seriously at loss to why he's so highly regarded as an actor.

These movies never end nicely. I thought Cameron Diaz mailed in her performance. (What is it with her tattoos?) The rest of the cast seemed OK in their roles. Viewers that like movies with a plot that is developed through coherently connected scenes may not like this movie, as the story moves forward on ""high points.""

It tries to be smarter than it is. It tries to be cryptic when it's really mostly unnecessary, and the rest is blatantly obvious foreshadowing.The best way I can describe this movie is if a sub-plot that could've ran it's course in 15 minutes in another movie, was made into a feature film, padded with tons of extra dialogue, and a few unnecessary scenes to extend the runtime, it would be the Counselor.To date my lowest rated movie on IMDb out of almost 700 movies, is a 3.

On the outside it looks like a thriller, and it does have the set up of a good thriller, but its more just a dark brooding and sometimes darkly humorous drama that has thriller like moments. I'm fairly certain if you liked No Country for Old Men the style won't be all that different to you, since it is written by Cormac McCarthy like the source material for that one was, except The Counselor was personally written by his hand alone. I've read reviews complaining its too predictable but I feel like that's the point, as it involves a relatively ""good man"" getting in bed with a drug cartel and everyone kind of tells him to be sure that he understands, that bad things could/will happen. I don't see this as a complaint, since A.) real people get involved in this stuff knowing bad things can happen despite all the warnings heard ahead of time and B.) some of the obvious foreshadows have great pay offs, and C.) knowing what's to come and watching anyways has a sort of knowing dread about it. Anyways, I've read a couple reviews offering it high praise and a lot of them completely bashing it, I'm somewhere in the middle but leaning more toward the former positive critique.

331,mikelivesey-93314,""" A Masterpiece of a film.""",10,19 June 2021,"When I saw the trailer for this film my interest was immediately woken due to the cast and director also the writer.Cormac McCarthy writes epic material, Ridley Scott makes epic and sublime films, Kingdom of Heaven being my favourite. The cast Michael Fassbender, Penelope Cruz, Javier Bardem, Brad Pitt and Cameron Diaz all have made exceptional stuff in their own ways. This film sort of throws everything you've seen from each of these actors / actresses on it's head in so many ways.The biggest change for me was Cameron Diaz playing the most evil bad ass ever. I'm not saying that to be corny even though it sounds it. We are so used to seeing Diaz playing in rom-coms and sickly sweet comedies that to see her play such a manipulative and unempathetic character as she did was quite frankly mesmerizing. There is very little gory scenes and that is good because the one's which do happen stick with you for very different reasons. It's the psychology of the events and the slow but gently upward level of psychological suspense which draws you in and does the damage.The plot of a greedy lawyer wanting to make a "" Fassbuck "" by getting in on a drug deal with his friend Reiner ( Bardem.) is almost a cliqued plot line but the moral tale which unfolds because of the decisions taken and the effects on other peoples lives is truly the films strength. The essence of realisation after making decisions and the hefty consequences which loved ones end up paying for is monumental.For me, seeing Fassbender trying to put things right towards the end by contacting two intermediary's to hopefully intervene in what is quite frankly a terrifying end for his partner is one of the best roles and scenes he's ever took part in. The Counsellor is a double edged sword, that of a lawyer in America and one is a psychotherapist. The second intervention comes across as that of a psychotherapist who will listen to your problems but cannot intervene. The decisions you make have consequences and they are outside of your control.This is one of the most under rated gems of films ever and is now one of my favourites for so many reasons. I simply cannot understand the negative reviews and think that over time this will become a classic film.",The Counselor

333,aiduta,A metaphor of death,8,11 December 2013,"...may contain spoilers.As most people, I went to see this movie with little or no expectations. I could not have been more wrong. I was energized, inspired and amused by the movie. Firstly, all and all, I believe the beginning of the movie is actually one of the best sex scenes I've ever seen, as Penelope Cruz has a way of filling the screen with femininity. The scene is set by series of character-D defining moments for what turn out to be the themes of the story. I believe this would be the initial bed scene, for the counselor. He defines himself, for the first time clearly in his life, through the woman he loves. Later, he even says: 'Life is being in bed with you. Everything else is just waiting.' Aside from her and the revelation of this phrase, there is no character development. He doesn't even have a name. We find him actually to border the legendary Josef K. Kafkian character. He finds destiny's hand surprising and implacable, and he is reduced back to emptiness by the cruel murder of his loved one.However, the most important metaphor scene is the cheetah hunting scene, reflected in the eyes of Malkina. It reveals the biggest theme of the movie: death, in 2 manners:-in its purest shape, by hunt, the hunter and the prey in the most honest of relationships;death, brought upon by man, in its ugly twisted shapes, as delivered by the Colombian cartel. I found quite poetical the way that the cheetah hunt is developed in a character (and a movie, after all). Speaking of characters, they are all quite unique, charming and unrealistic while well polished. The way the drug dealers handle impending death is again without questions and fight. The reaction in front of death is that of rabbit in the taillights, stunned (Reiner), or rabbit running, chased by the playful cheetah (Malkina). None of the 2 is an actual predator, but a philosophical victim of the inner death brought upon by the drug business. I believe the delivery of the actors was excellent, and especially Cameron Diaz in the role of Malkina. She is elusive to everyone and even us, while playing her scheme in plain sight. In the words of smartypants Brad Pitt: 'You don't know someone until you know what they want.' Her agenda seems to be missed by everyone, as she seems to be paying too much attention to her game and character development. The chase for the running victims is short and precise, with the fatal blow being delivered literally to the carotid. The image of the film is incredibly warm, in an été indien fashion which brings out the looks of the actors, as well as their 'costume' detail: fake tan and hair (Reiner), tattoos (Malkina), or simply sheer beauty (Laura).Of course, there are hiccups in the movie, starting from screenplay and ending with editing. Half of the dialogs are unnecessary or flat. There seem to be mostly monologues, as there are no intelligent replies left for the recipients of the wisdom generously spread by all characters. The Mexican lawyer hardly speaks any English in one scene, while in the next one, he delivers a 15 minute fluent speech with just a touch of accent. But I feel that the flaws of the movie should not be held too much against its originality, courage and elegance in touching the delicate nature of life and death.",The Counselor

You will sit back, like in the end of The Usual Suspects, and put it all together.Movies based on McCarthy novels are not hero epics about one last job, the wrongly accused or the woman who won't give up. The protagonist doesn't get beaten down until she finally wins. In all of the McCarthy movies, the characters make decisions based on their beliefs about the world and the plot unfolds as they come to terms with the consequences of their choices. The dialog is creepy but not random at all; you're never quite sure who the winners and losers will be, but the clues are all there.Expectations are the big problem here, not the movie.

Once they contacted the middle man played by Brad Pitt. The whole thing started to unravel. She is the evil behind it all. This film has no good ending so lots of people hate it.

Drugs after all are a dirty business. I found it symbolic therefore that the valuable cargo was welded inside a truck carrying raw sewage from place to place. I also caught the symbolism of the leopard hunting the rabbits. Of course the chief villain was symbolic of the leopard who was the hunter. The drug dealers and investors were the rabbits that said leopard was on the hunt for.Unfortunately, the symbolism was not enough to hold my attention.

The film is not so much a plausible unfolding of events as it is a vehicle for its characters to act as oracles in the midst of impending catastrophe. Many of these sequences are quite good, for instance, the conversation between Jefe (Reuben Blades) and the councilor (Michael Fassbender) and that between Malkina (Cameron Diaz) and her banker in the closing scene.This is a good film, which seems to have the skeleton of a great film but was never fleshed out.

Only people who can't handle films like this, that holds no bars, or can't connect themes to story and characters will disagree. Both story and dialogue are phenomenally well done, but not for everyone, don't expect your typical Hollywood feel good pass on a dark story and theme. Some characters were very good just not enough time to embellish on them. There are few flaws with a movie that is super crafty in it's story and dialogue. The acting and characters are not necessarily the focal point although they all do an amazing job and a couple characters are key points in the plot but its about the themes, reality and story (which the dialogue conveys so well, especially Cameron Diaz at times and key monologues by non-big characters in ladder part of story). It's missing a powerful soundtrack though, considering it's daunting themes and reality, a powerful soundtrack could have made the movie a good 9.I would give it an 8-8.5 ... Only movies this year that rival it or are better are Gravity (rare feat to have the masses and I love it) and Mud as well was a great movie. Few more to come including Out of the Furnace.

Throughout the film, the philosophy of life, women, and sex are elaborated through many lengthy dialogs that require the audience to be patient in following. Ridley Scott and Comac McCarthy seemed to forget that the audience needs information that can be digested through the screen. The film has very minimal information, such as : Counselor's real name was never mentioned, what was the real deal of Counselor-Reiner (Javier Bardem)-Westray (Brad Pitt), who is actually Malkina (Cameron Diaz) and for whom she work and what her motive, who's the boss of the motor driver, police in disguise, et all? Minimum information is sometimes done to create an interesting twist, but there are too many questions that are not answered in the Counselor. The film is forcing the audience to develop the story in their own mind and keep guessing what really happened. I found many scene that are not really important, and doesn't have a clear connection to the movie, like a counselor meetings with the diamond expert, Malkina's confession, angry stranger on the Counselor at the café. Only the execution of the murder arguably good, because the prior information is told to the audience in the very clear dialog, for example : when Counselor receive the DVD says ""Hola!"", the audience already knows what's in it because Westray had told Counselor in earlier scene. (reinforced by the scene of body parts Laura in the trash). Including the murder of Westray, we know it from the dialog of Reiner-Counselor. What annoying is the logical action of the character. When these people are dealing with illicit drug business and his life, is it not too obvious for them to have some bodyguards? Well, Counselor might be a new person, but wealthy figure like Reiner would like to go alone with only 2 leopards? Especially when it is supposed he shared with Malkina? Is it not too careless? Then would not be the counselor able to guess that his telephone was tapped? I hope that ""Boise""-thing is just Counselor's trickery to distract the enemy, but it's just to prove that Counselor is stupid. Laura kidnapping also feels strange, she appears to have reached a certain place, and lowered his stuff, does not she should choose to use the services of valets? The last illogical thing is Westray simply get attracted to a beautiful women, and in a scene that is not shown, unexpectedly the beautiful women have gotten all the secret codes, is it not too easy? The information provided at the end of the film is Malkina as the enemy in the blanket -- and that's not enough! NOTE also, that this movie is very love to behead people.

Javier Bardem plays some rich guy who's mixed up in the deal with him, and Brad Pitt is another rich guy in this deal. The aim is to import cocaine from Mexico to Chicago, sell it there and split the profit. Then everything starts to go wrong.

I believe that the writing is that which has created the vast disparity in professional reviews. The New York Times (?) reviewer gave the film her highest marks whereas others viewed the film as being sub par or even disastrous. How could this be? Perhaps because of the origins of the script, from the hand of McCarthy, a literary master. I was recently watching a Tennessee Williams play adapted for the screen by Kazan, and I could feel the weight of its literary origins. This was how I felt watching TC. The plot, setting, and, more generally, the world, McCarthy creates are vehicles for the theme, that of the human condition, man's striving, reaching, cunning, and ultimately, his animal nature. This was the risk taken by Scott in allowing such a heavy-weight to pen the script, that the film would be driven by theme rather than plot, and that it would not quite fit in with today's banal, CGI-infected cinema culture, which, perhaps, it pretended to be by its glossy exterior. The ""overly-long"" dialog was especially trying for short attention spans but those who may have enjoyed the great cinematic classics over the past century will adore this creation. Through thematic contrivance is created a jungle filled with various inhabitants. Through a form of Darwinian selection, the weak are slowly exiled from this unforgiving world until only those with an appetite for blood and an intolerance for weakness are allowed to remain. There is enough blood and perversion to keep you smiling, but the weight of its humanity will grip your soul. Please ignore the critics, Mr. Scott, and continue allowing your cinematic muse to light your path, even if Hollywood keeps telling you that you must help pay the bills. (See Mr. Welles, not Mr. Spielberg.)",The Counselor

371,eaysha,Wacky and weird in its redemptive power,7,14 June 2016,"The Counselor (2013): Drugs, Love and Cross-Border RelationsTo me the movie The Counselor (2013) – and probably Cormac McCarthy's original novel – is about the relationship between Mexico and the United States, with the Mexicans having the upper hand in the end, even if it comes at the cost of their own people. You can see this almost from the word go, such as the scene where the Mexican on the motorcycle (Richard Cabral) convinces an American women that he diets on dog food, in response to the fact that the obnoxious woman can't believe a Mexican has a pet dog. None of this should detract for what an exquisite movie-making, of course – the multi-track, loopy narrative, the gorgeous cinematography, nasty soundtrack, the depth of the characters, the sex scenes – but it's always prudent to highlight features of the movie that people, critics and viewers alike, probably haven't caught onto.Colour contrasts By extension Ridley Scott seems to have it in for blond people (you see this in The Martian as well; see my review on Cairo Scene). Michael Fassbender is as Aryan as they come (he also has bad teeth here), and then there's Brad Pitt who plays a 'Canadian' and who eventually gets ensnared with the help of another ultra-blonde (played by British actress Natalie Dormer). Cameron Diaz does come out on top in the end but she has head off abroad to escape the wrath of the cartels. And it's also noticeable that the two goons who steal the truck with the drugs are blond themselves, but the Mexican cartel gets the consignment back nonetheless. (One of them decapitated Ruth's son – the motorcycle man – and you're really happy when he gets riddled with bullets). Even the European character in the movie, the Dutch diamond dealer, is a Sephardi Jew in origin (i.e. Spanish), if ironically played by a German (Bruno Ganz). The infamous counselor himself ends up having to take refuge in Mexico, coming to appreciate the people and their plight, while a Mexican friend of his is the one that finally gets him off the hook with the cartels. All his friend asks for in exchange a handshake, the classical symbol of honor and mutual trust. (It's actually an Arabic tradition following the signing of contracts). Why, then, the snuff movie murder of Laura (Penélope Cruz)? You know it's her body dumped in the garbage heap because of the red dress. She represents a healthy relationship between America and Mexico, since the counselor – as a lawyer he is supposed to fight for the rights of the downtrodden – picks her up off the street, so to speak, and lavishes her with precision gifts (the diamond ring). He's even willing to die for her, although he (sadly) never gets the chance. His ill-conceived foray into the world of crime is really for her, so he can afford to give her the style of life he thinks she deserves. That explains the scene where Reiner (Javier Bardem) asks the counselor why he decided to get involved in this racket. It wasn't greed because Reiner had tried to attract him into the business before, to no avail. Ironically counselor is trying to be a 'hero,' someone rescuing the damsel in distress and making her into a princess, but he did in the Greek way as opposed to the Biblical way – being a warrior instead of the penitent man, to quote the Dutch diamond dealer.Consultancy fees Alas, the kind of people who preside over US-Mexican relations – drug lords and people traffickers on both sides – won't let such a relationship prosper, hence Laura's gruesome death. The counselor himself is partly to blame. You feel his decision to get into the drugs business is also partly driven by a sense of intellectual superiority vis-à-vis his clients. (There's a similar scene in Into the Blue with the equally corrupt and blond lawyer Bryce). Hence, the prison scene with Ruth (Rosie Perez). He gets humbled at the end but the price is harrowing. Note also that Diaz's character Malkina – I think that means 'cat' – isn't American originally. (She loves her pet cheetah and has a cheetah tattoo on her back). Note the confessional scene where she says her parents were illegal migrants who drowned in the Atlantic ocean. You also feel she's a fake blonde, and her greed and appetite for control makes her find Laura interesting and 'arousing'. (She only goes to confessional in mock imitation of Laura's good Catholic/Mexican upbringing). She's also the quintessential globe trotter, leaving her adopted country when things turn sour, stealing Westray's money from his London account, and planning to head off to Hong Kong with the help of a Latin accountant. Money is footloose and no longer respects national loyalties. Malkina's erstwhile boyfriend, Reiner, is busy trying to uproot himself from his Mexican or Latin origins himself. Reiner as a name doesn't sound Latin at all while he has an old American flag at his residence, like Southerners with Confederate flags to commemorate the Civil War. (He previously had a black girlfriend that also took an interest in women). The story has a very Catholic ethos, penance and guilt and finding grace or peace of mind. This isn't the most straight forward way of going about extolling those virtues, but if anybody can pull it off, it's Ridley Scott. Gangster epics are his kind of thing, as are cross-cultural relations movies (American Gangster, Someone to Watch Over Me, Black Rain). I'm just happy the Texan and Mexican setting of the movie counteracted Scott's Englishy preference for grays and dark greens!By Emad El-Din Aysha, a freelance Egyptian movie reviewer with Cairo Scene and Mada Masr.",The Counselor

The film tells the story of a lawyer (Fassbender), who finds himself in over his head when he gets involved in drug trafficking.Seeing our truck being used to hide the drugs in, and be used as a featured vehicle was amazing.

385,griffordgl,Scott and McCarthy -- Approaching Perfection,10,28 October 2013,"SPOILER ALERT -- ! In this review, I reveal important plot details regarding ""The Counselor,"" ""Blood Meridian,"" and ""No Country For Old Men.""A lot of people are trashing Ridley Scott's new film, ""The Counselor""...but honestly, I think they're misunderstanding the film's characters, monologues, and themes -- chiefly because they're not familiar with Cormac McCarthy's style, outlook, or world view. I think they're expecting something mostly Scott...instead of something wholly McCarthy -- and I say that because I felt that ""The Counselor"" was mostly the product of McCarthy's (first) screenplay rather than Scott's direction.My good friend's criticism was simple enough: ""I saw everything coming! This movie was way too predictable!"" But again, because he's so unfamiliar with McCarthy's ""universe,"" he didn't enjoy the film.For the record...I have read EVERY (published) McCarthy novel and I have seen MOST of Scott's films (I never saw ""A Good Year"" or ""Legend"" or a few others not worth mentioning)...so I feel that I'm in a very good position to offer my opinion concerning ""The Counselor"" -- perhaps the best film I saw in 2013.To my friend who said that ""The Counselor"" was too predictable...I will agree; upon second viewing, this film is FILLED with not-so-subtle hints that death and misery will befall its main character, the Counselor. Like other McCarthy works, certain characters WARN other characters of impending (and highly probable) death...but the warnings always go unheeded...and the characters (in this case, the main character's love interest) suffer GREATLY.In ""Blood Meridian"" (Cormac's greatest work of the '80s) an old Mennonite warns the soldiers (and the main character) not to go on their journey. The men are slaughtered later. Later in the story, a juggler tells fortunes using tarot cards...and later, the men are killed in various ways.Cameron Diaz's character, Malkina, like the Judge from ""Blood Meridian"" or Anton Chigurh from ""No Country For Old Men,"" orchestrates death...and ultimately finds immunity from it. Many who read ""Blood Meridian"" surmise that the Judge is a god. Chigurh is certainly a ""prophet of death."" Now, I'm not suggesting that Malkina is a goddess...but a ""prophetess...of death""? Certainly. Malkina is certainly a McCarthy character -- but sadly, Diaz is the weakest link in the cast.""The Counselor"" is FILLED with other ""McCarthisms"" that I found noteworthy:Death is meaningless and any attempt to avoid or escape it is futile. (""You can't stop what's comin'."") Death befalls those who don't necessarily deserve it; death, justly or unjustly, is often the result of choice by somebody other -- i.e. our choices will kill US...or kill those we love.All in all, Scott's film is excellent -- but definitely more enjoyable if you LOVE McCarthy's writing style and his character's philosophies. The Jefe (played EXPERTLY by Ruben Blades) delivers an amazing monologue about how our choices CREATE our world. It's a timeless lesson.",The Counselor

Michael Fassbender brilliant as title character, The Counselor, totally out of his depth in a drug deal gone horribly wrong. Greed and avarice are the main themes here, not one character immune, possibly save for the doe eyed Penelope Cruz.

387,zeddie8,The Counselor: A Wasted Opportunity,2,3 November 2013,"This should be a lesson to directors: Don't let the author of the book be the sole screenwriter. In this case, director Ridley Scott should have stood up to Cormac McCarthy and said, ""There will be another set of eyes on the script."" But he didn't, and the result is a disastrous muddle of a movie. Because McCarthy was too close to his material, he had no perspective on what the audience needs to know and when we need to know it. Hours go by before we understand the motives of several key characters. The two points I give this movie are for the stylish sets and trappings: fabulous cars, breathtaking home interiors, costumes of the rich and insane. As to the acting, there are some high points but for the most part it is spotty: Cameron Diaz does it up to the hilt as a diamond-hard, ruthless, man-trap of a drug kingpin drenched in gorgeous jewels. Javier Bardem is a manic, opportunistic narcissist with hair that looks like he blow-dried it by air-boat fan. Brad Pitt is just kind of there. Penelope Cruz is delicious and soulful as the girlfriend who most likely met her end in a snuff film (it's implied but not shown).Most disappointing was Michael Fassbender, but not because he didn't do his best. The script left him with nothing to say of interest.Nearly every primary character as well as one secondary Mexican ""patron"" (whose part in the great scheme we never are told) makes a speech. These monologues are supposed to be natural parts of conversations. Instead, they come across as ponderous and eye-glazing. Good screen writers must have an ear for dialogue. McCarthy does not, and we tire of his people pontificating to each other.You will be able to go for popcorn refills during some of them. This was a wasted opportunity for a group of A-list actors.

This film will be worth watching several times over in order to milk every last morsel of thought from some of the denser monologues.

390,tantonr-825-408472,Very Elegant Snuff Porn,4,10 November 2013,"I went to see this movie because of the stellar cast. I knew it would be violent and probably gory as well, but, after more than 40 yrs. in forensics, that was no big deal. Why then did I leave the movie upset? It took me several days to sort that out. Certainly the movie looked and sounded beautiful! The actors all gave professional performances, but the character development only allowed me to marginally care about Cruz and Bardem. One of the things that I puzzled over was, ""What was the movie actually about?"" Was it a struggle between good and evil? If so, there wasn't much of a struggle. Was it supposed to be a realistic glimpse of the violent drug underworld? Well, it was certainly dark and unpleasant in places and appeared to be realistic, but whether that is actually realistic is hard to know. OK, maybe it was just a good story! Really? There were so many holes and non-sequiturs in the story that it was hard to figure out what was going on, much less determine its value. At this point, I decided to try to evaluate the film by what it emphasized and what it valued. Certainly an important indicator of what the creators value can be determined by where they decide to end the story. In this case there was a very clear winner. This character, without seeming to even break a sweat, manages to decimate all the other major characters and then apparently lives happily ever after (so much for realism). But I began to think about what this character really valued it was the beauty involved in killing someone (or something) in a particularly elegant way. Bingo! That's when I GOT IT! This film is essentially about people being killed in extravagantly ""beautiful"" ways. Of course, the killings come at the end of the movie to give us a chance to care about the characters being killed, hence making it even more horrific. This works with only marginal success. And just in case you may not fully appreciate these lethal methods, several of them are verbally described in casual conversation by the main characters earlier in the movie to prep you. And as a final argument on this point, virtually all the scenes of cinematic significance in the movie were the kill scenes. The motorcyclist's clothesline was a beauty. And, of course, the cruelest act was perpetrated upon one of the major characters. His world destroyed, he is left alive to fully absorb his grief and wait So, summing up, I think that this was a beautifully photographed, well-acted, poorly scripted example of snuff porn. If there was some profound, meaning-of-life significance to this movie, I missed it.",The Counselor
391,dstroink,"Felt like a two hour ad for Calvin Klein, but a really good one",5,29 October 2013,"The Counselor is the work of a fantastic director, an incredible writer and an A+ cast but sadly it just wasn't put together well enough to be an effective movie. It was written by the talented Cormac McCarthy, this is his screenplay debut and his lack of experience shows, he seems to forget that he is writing the script of a modern film and not a novel or a play. Many of the scenes are lengthy, one on one exchanges between two characters who speak in long extended monologues. The dialog itself is sharp, cryptic and original, I loved hearing the characters' philosophical banter about death, religion, sex, acceptance etc. The simple yet tragic story however is muffled by the heavy abstract dialog, which seems to be trying to be as far from expository as possible. It's hard to make out the details of what's actually happening and you constantly find yourself asking, what's the point? I did however enjoy the writing, it was dark and beautiful and I'd love to see McCarthy return to this style in another, perhaps more illustrative script. The characters, who are portrayed by some of the most talented actors out there, are all ambiguous, intellectual, bad-asses. It's fun to see slick, eccentric characters like these, but there is no variety, everyone is simply a beautiful and sadistic human being and it becomes very boring to watch. Nobody is lovable, or realistic, or funny or imperfect. It is also impossible to become invested in the characters or the story line. Just a bunch of cool people wearing expensive sunglasses saying and doing cool things, which is enjoyable, but not for a solid two hours. The cinematography is exceptional, each shot has the aesthetic quality of a well thought out photograph. There was clearly a lot of thought put into camera angles, and where characters and objects were placed within the frame. I was never bored admiring the exotic, luxurious locations captured with such skill. All in all, the ambitious dialog, the beautiful cinematography and the very capable cast, coupled with a very intense soundtrack made for a film that successfully created a very dark, poignant tone. Unfortunately the story was unclear, despite being very basic. The characters did not contrast each other at all, and it was hard to give a damn about any of it. I'd recommend it to anyone interested in film since I did have a good time and I think there's a lot to take away from it.

395,a_mnsk,The film is not as bad as people think it is.,7,18 November 2013,"The Counsellor is a film that is about trust, friendship and moral decisions. The film has recently been getting many bad ratings and comments due to the turn Cormac McCarthy and Ridley Scott have taken, the muddled storyline and terrible acting.There are a few points to consider. The first being the film is not something you'd expect from Cormac but it is unique and fits perfectly with Ridley Scott.The plot is about a man who invests in drug trafficking therefore making him wealthy but choices sometimes have consequences. Now the film isn't happy nor exciting. It's dark and gripping. Related around drugs it's probably targeted for adults. The storyline may not be as clear due to scenes relating in and out of context but however the storyline does in fact pull you in. It story gives you hints of what's coming next yet it is subliminal.Many people were attracted to this film due to it's cast. I mean surely the acting couldn't be bad. But it's the truth. The acting was neither bad not good. I'd say Cameron Diaz did not blow us away this time. The acting is sometimes dull and I do agree as to it may be over-acting and a bit too subtle.Comarc McCarthy's screenplay for the film may have been exaggerated to some viewers. However the writing of the film is detailed and clear. The role of each character and the personality of each character can be told by what they say and that is what impressed me. There are many moral quotes in this film and many people argue that it has been exaggerated and it probably has due to it being too much of fancy in-depth style writing. But this is the style Cormac wants you to see and he has certainly done that.In conclusion, the movie isn't as bad as they say. So don't be scared to waste your money to see it. It has many morals and a wise in-depth study on how choices can have consequences. The movie didn't amaze me but it sure did impress me.",The Counselor

398,thostrat,Cameron Diaz...,1,13 November 2013,What a waste of time. Ridley Scott owes me about two hours of my life time now. Even four great actors couldn't compensate the horrible appearance of Cameron Diaz. She will hopefully burn in hell for doing another crab job in her useless life. Why did she actually become that successful? Aren't there enough other dump blonds out in the world who are trying to become an actress in Hollywood? Also all the other actors have been doing way better jobs before. I guess they thought they could rely on each other. So they only gave 50% of there energy. I had to give only one point. Just to lower the average points because there are actually people who think this movie deserves eight points. They are probably blind or saw a different movie. Well I should stop calling it a movie. Pointless mix of boring film scenes would be a better description of what I just saw. It's to sad nobody will ever read this. I hope I could at least put a smile on the person's face who checks the reviews.,The Counselor
399,misscharliedaniels,Fur Coat. Dazzling Bling. Big Guns. No Knickers. (And that's just Cameron Diaz!),6,18 November 2016,"The film itself is bright, adventurous and the cinematography superb. It is not afraid to take risks and is unashamedly bold. I'm saying all of this upfront because I don't want the rest of the review to put anyone off watching the film. I'm sure we all read reviews then watch a film and think the reviewer was too harsh, so I should say right now the film IS watchable and entertaining, my issue is with the screen play. So with an all star cast in place, The Counselor already gives us a certain level of expectation and to be fair each actor works well within the confines of the script. The sets, costumes and overall painting of excess shine out at you like a combination of Grand Designs and neon sign on a tacky strip joint. Ridley Scott really has made his glossy mark on the film, the trouble is there is no real substance, the characters are two dimensional and my biggest issue with it is the dialogue. As a writer myself (the published kind not merely a fantasist) writing is a craft. Whilst I wouldn't know how to make a great film I do know what is good and what is poor writing and I'm afraid the screen writing in this film was dire. Since watching, I've discovered the author of the book was using this film as his first attempt at a screen play. As a writer I empathise - as a viewer I cringe. With what I'm certain was a massive budget, I cannot understand why either a pro screen writer wasn't hired - and the author made an executive, or the other way around. Some of the characters are believable some not. You get the feeling someone decided Pitt had to be in the film then added him at the last minute, he is surplus to requirements and has no screen presence at all. Diaz is EXTRAORDINARY and if you don't want to watch the whole film just skip to the bit where she jumps on a car bonnet, without spoiling it I have to say it was a mind-blowing and mesmerising performance. Fassbender is as gorgeous as ever but you are left wondering how this Bentley driving, already successful lawyer, with little taste for conflict, ever had the need let alone the courage to get into the mix in the first place. This makes any kind of empathy difficult. Cruz is a sexy as ever (and I'm a straight woman talking!) but again the overall sense is her church going character is only there to show how bad others are. Bardem's performance is witty and engaging yet sadly the writing gives him a story line that makes him neither tough or clever, that's a real shame because he does either exceptionally well given the right content. In one scene Pitt is given a long monologue talking in riddles and an endless vomit of philosophy, you're left thinking, where did that come from? Then another character does the same although to be fair he DOES pull this off (without spoiling anything I will simply say this was a mob boss. The timing and subject of this moment are done to perfection). The problem is, later there's a THIRD scene with an almost identical vibe and you start to realise that the screen play dialogue is simply trying to be clever - yet it just ends up becoming annoying and unbelievable. The writer has clearly taken thought provoking thought processes contained within the book and tried to weave them into unconvincing speech patterns, leaving you with a cross between a Shakespeare soliloquy and one of Johnathan Cainer's puzzling horoscopes. The plot doesn't have much of an arc, it just kind of moves along at its own pace, although it does have a dramatic, emotional punch at the end, in fact I note with amusement one of the awards categories this film won was entitled ""Movies You Wanted to Love, But Just Couldn't""The Counselor is shallow, hollow and yet somehow still spectacular. If you don't need a film to offer you intelligence or culture and love a sex and shoot-em-up movie, or you just like shock value - you MIGHT like it...",The Counselor

Worst part is that that ""wisdom"" and ""scenery"" do not really match, i mean the monologues are literally forced to the movie. I felt sorry for the hours wasted. One thing that kept me thinking for days was that the brilliant actors who agreed to play must have seen something special about the movie.

Scene was really done well. this type of dialogue stays in the whole movie and is great. and then you keep waiting for things to happen. and it doesn't The movie stays flat. stale. offers no clarity on the movie. And when some things actually happen. You are kind of shielded from the action. you miss out so to speak, you don't get to know what's going on. It's actually a poor attempt of suspense in my opinion. and there are many ways to interpret the ending. which is the biggest sin in the movies! no real ending. no closure! nothing really. its a failure. which is a shame. *personal comments *Fassbender is hot right now. and all his movies have been really good. until now.

I have only read a few things by Cormac McCarthy, but all of his books are on my list to read. Throughout the movie, I couldn't wait to purchase the book - I almost took out my phone and ordered it immediately during the movie. The language and dialogue were amazing - true Cormac McCarthy in his brilliance.

Wanted to walk out on it several times but circumstances prevented that. I wouldn't view this for free. Screenplay was uneven, too talky at times, and too gratuitously violent at others. Surprisingly, I think Cameron Diaz & Brad Pitt may have given the best performances in the film, even with Fassbender's accomplished acting resume. Waste of a once in a lifetime cast.Natalie Dormer's scenes were left out of the movie, so don't count on seeing much of her. The problem with this movie is the script, not the acting.

First of all, plot, where you are totally lost: you don't understand what happening, who the characters are and what is their motivation. That leads to the next failure - we don't care about the main characters, we even don't feel sorry for them when they are killed. All the movie is overflowed with dialogs and speeches, which are trying to be clever and deep, but they aren't.At the end we have 2 hours long, boring, story... which hardly can be called a ""story"".",The Counselor
406,erik-hornstrom,Great movie that's not your usual Hollywood production. Underrated.,10,27 December 2013,"I think this is a great movie. It feels modern and different. Although, as mentioned by others, it may be a lot of metaphors, but they keep me thinking even after the movie has ended, and they keep me awake even though it's a 12 pm movie. The scenes and conversations are also critiqued because many feels that they contain a lot that doesn't push the movie forward, but I'm tired of the pushing. If something is mentioned it the beginning it DOESN'T have to have a meaning in the end.The violence and the ending really sets a dark tone. I like it a lot.Reading other reviews I come to the conclusion that the majority of the reviewers seems to think that you have to know everything about the story line and the whole history of each character for them to give the movie a good review. There can be absolutely no question marks. If you think this way as well this is not a movie for you. You get thrown in events that is a part of a mans life (The Counselors life) and you follow him from that time without flashbacks. Simply put: You don't get much background, but there is no need for it either, it rather lifts the movie up, and as an exception to almost all other Hollywood productions, you get the chance to think for yourself.The majority of the reviewer also seems to think that you have to understand every word, every sentence and every message in the movie without thinking twice, to give it a good review. I believe that most of the reviewers are to full of themselves and doesn't have enough self distance to understand that he or she probably isn't the smartest person in the world and can't understand every little thing that is said in a movie.

407,reinierselman,What a waist,1,21 November 2013,"The first words that came up to me, after watching this terrible movie, were: 'you've got to be kidding me'. Like any other person who visited this movie, it was the cast that caught my eye. Fassbender, Bardem and Pitt in particular are well respected and talented actors. Actors people want to see on the big screen. However, even these great talents couldn't help this movie became a horrendous disaster. This movie doesn't make sense at all and is just dumb and simple. It jumps from scene to scene and it makes you often wonder why some scenes are even in this film in the first place. After I watched it I wondered if I was the only one who didn't get the point. After I looked around I only saw people who were really confused, wondering if this was it. Nobody understood why this Counselor needed the extra money. It seemed like the guy was already rich. There are two parts in this movie that made me really infuriating, more then the rest of the film. First, there was no character development. All of characters stay flat and abstract. Even all the characters of CSI Miami, including Horatio, are more developed than Cruz, Diaz, Fassbender and all the rest of the crew. Second, the awful, confusing, horrendous and insulting scene were Diaz's character 'makes love' to a Ferrari. I've never seen such a weird and dumb scene in my life. So please, don't waist any money and don't watch this awful movie.",The Counselor

You can say that ""The Counsellor"" Wasn't a man from the mean that he was living on, that he acted pretty ""Dumn"" and that he was innocent if you consider the kind of people that we was making business and surround himself. He made all about love, but this love had luxury, ambition, and it made his path for personal doom and unfortunately his plans all disrupted. I was really AMAZED by Cameron Diaz character, for me she alone granted the movie success, but i consider the others actors work very good and they could make the movie even more interesting. The hunter majestically hunts the prey and all in this world have a price, even the head of your loved woman. You can't be innocent and passionate when you mess with this kind of people. Enigmatic Brad Pitt messed up with all the dialogs and made his point on crazy\intelligent character. Very good movie, interesting and sad, very sad and won't let you sleep very good thinking of it.

411,dkinnis,2 hours of not knowing what to feel.,5,27 October 2013,"There have been few times where I left the movie theater not knowing how to feel about a movie: one was Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1 and the other was Cloud Atlas (though I watched a second time and loved it). The Counselor left me with the same feeling of emptiness and confusion. One of the good things about the movie was the all-star cast: Cameron Diaz (this her most exotic role), Michael Fassbender, Brad Pitt, and Penelope Cruz. In the movie you kept wanting to more about the characters, but the movie really under develops the build up the ending for each character. The other good thing about the movie is the actors do really well acting (redundant because it's their job), but like before this movie can be described as monotoned and very under developed Now on the to bad: The plot was really simple and ........ boring. Cameron Diaz is spending the entire movie being the darkest of characters in the movie, but it doesn't give you the satisfaction that her role delivers as the antagonist. Another is the terrible action, this movie was all dialogue and NO ACTION. Very, very, very boring. After leaving the movie, I thought about many things to make it better, but most of the movie would leave a regular person checking their phone to see if it's almost over. With all the advertising on YouTube, commercials, and on other websites. It was over hyped to a major extent and it seemed that 20th Century Fox was desperate to spend millions of dollars just to make a quick return on profit. My conclusion: wait till the movie is released online or on Redbox to watch the movie. Don't waste the $15 on this movie now, spend it on something useful like alcohol or 3 gallons of gas.",The Counselor
412,ethan-lazuk,A film for film lovers,8,17 December 2013,"This is a film for people who love films. Ridley Scott offers the closest rendering to what Cormac McCarthy was likely envisioning when he penned this thriller --and later when he executive produced it (with others, of course). This is not a film for the weekend cinema-going entertainment seeker. But if you loved the Coen Brothers' interpretation of ""No Country for Old Men,"" and you want to see another creative take on McCarthy's words in live action, then drop everything and see this film now. Just be sure to pay attention to EVERY damn word, or else you may not give it the credit it deserves. The Counselor is the harbinger of a new era in film, in which selective tastes dominate -- thank you internet-- and globalization reveals that America is still the king of cinema, only now it contains both a North ... and a South (see also: FX's ""The Bridge""). The truth is, The Counselor is a failed success. As a film, it's brilliant. As a weekend movie, it's not. Thankfully, a new era is upon us, and two years from now, when The Counselor hits Netflix, it'll probably get the 8/10 or 9/10 it deserves.",The Counselor

The casting was a mess with Cameron Diaz so misplaced and the car scene was pointless with no relevance to the plot. I was at a loss to know why Fassbender was called The Counselor, he has no charisma and seemed more like a mild mannered accountant than a hard, greedy lawyer. The film did have a gritty edge to it showing some of the harsher side of the drugs world without the Hollywood schmaltz. There were silly errors such as one decapitation showing one blood what so ever and the next the blood was spurting everywhere.

417,kaspar-schultz,masterpiece of the 21st century,10,7 May 2014,"Ridley Scott's The Counselor is definitely a movie worth seeing. Despite the bad ratings, it's probably the best allegorical films about greed and justice. In the beginning, the counselor finds himself in a situation, where he is not exactly short for cash, but needs more to buy a diamond. Although he is constantly told that things could go wrong and the effects would be irreversible, his greed cannot let him decline. What follows is the punishment for this decision, that cannot be changed or compromised with. A Kafkaesque punishment, that doesn't care whether it's your first time, you had good intentions or it was going to be a one time thing. People are punished and rewarded regardless of their actions and the main character just happened to get his punishment at that point. This idea is brilliantly delivered near the end by Ruben Blades. Most of the criticism is directed towards unreal dialog, yet they forget the fact that the movies is not about people like them. It's a depiction of the life of rich and beautiful, not a life story of an office worker.",The Counselor

Many scenes like the diamond purchase (even if the conversations has some philosophical points of interest), or the first scene, or...etc...etc...are simply there for...nothing.

419,jenn-haight1602,The Counselor proves that talented people can produce a horrendous mess,2,24 October 2013,"When the names Ridley Scott and Cormac McCarthy are connected to a project, one can't help but visualize the noir visual poetry of Scott's Blade Runner and think of the harsh, grim storytelling excellence of Cormac McCarthy. Unfortunately their project, The Counselor, lacks all of the wonder that has gained them respect in the film industry.The story, the first original screenplay written by Cormac McCarthy, is meant to be didactic but instead comes off as a pedantic mess. It clomps where it should glide and leaves film-goers expecting more than they receive. The story is about a lawyer, The Counselor, who somehow (that is never explained), is brought into a drug deal of some kind (which is never clarified), to an extent that we aren't privy to. There is also a secondary tier of characters who The Counselor knows, many of whom are also involved in the drug deal yet we never learn why or how they're involved; not what I was expecting from a man heralded as the most important writer in the country. Add to the soggy script McCormack's usual lack of understanding about women, his fascination with unnatural sex and predictable, but not particularly interesting violence. There are dozens of nonsense plot turns and character inconsistencies. Long amounts of time are spent in developing characters that never appear to have any significance in the film. Wise men abound; there's a wise diamond expert, drug cartel lord, and a couple of un-identified wise men. Meanwhile, the only three women in the film are a whore, a personified animal and nun. There are a few other women to be seen; either dancing in bikinis or pouring coffee.Whether it comes from the script or was added as an artistic touch from Scott, there is an infusion of grade school obvious symbolism throughout the film which is so blatantly obvious it borders on being offensive. The good guys live in completely white houses and the bad guys all drive black vehicles, that sort of thing. One of the many weaknesses of the film is the cartoon-like quality of the characters. It's difficult to determine if they were written that way or if it was an artistic decision on the part of Scott. Either way the experiment was a failure. While the cartoon effect can be used deftly in film, in this picture it creates one more bruise on an all around achingly painful film.Occasionally a disastrous script can still work on some level if there are exceptional performances. Unfortunately the two leads, Michael Fassbender and Cameron Diaz, are the weakest links in the picture. Michael Fassbender, as the good guy who made a bad choice, is meant to keep us engaged, even if we don't understand his motives or his reactions. We should feel something with or for the character. His performance is so flat that even at his most sniveling, snot-flying crying moments the audience sits in a numbed daze.Cameron Diaz is painfully inept for the lead role in which she is cast. She's supposed to be terrifying and mysterious, but instead comes off as not understanding the meaning of most of her lines as she recites them in a staccato tone reminiscent of a poor high school performance. It is such a clunky performance that she often emphasizes the wrong word in lines of dialog. As if her performance isn't ludicrous enough she is also saddled with a ridiculous appearance. Her character is literally designed to look like a cheetah. Her hair is sculpted to resemble the cat and she is tattooed from behind the ear all the way down her back with a cheetah pattern. The film opens and ends with a hit-you-over-the-head-with-a-frying-pan obvious symbol that she is the hunter. We're told repeatedly that she has ""done everything,"" and she says that she has ""done very bad things"" yet the only example we are given is a sophomoric, insulting, male erotic fantasy in the form of masturbation. The final scene of the film, which should be edifying and revelatory, instead is painfully predictable and full of the hunter symbolism which represses any message that could survive Diaz's droll delivery.image Javier Bardem, with his crazy troll hair and unthinkable clothing combinations, is ironically the most human of all the characters and perhaps it's due to his exceptional acting prowess. He is forlorn and powerful; confused and focused. The complexities that he brings to the part offer a welcome respite from the bland work by the leads.Brad Pitt shows up in all of the advertising but his part is minute. He plays an urban cowboy of sorts; he dresses in outdated polyester cowboy garb and is smart enough to have a well planned exit strategy if things go wrong. We are supposed to believe that this same man would fall for an obvious female infiltrator and that he would order Heineken at a bar in El Paso, TX. His character would never order an import. Conflicting minor details like this compound the myriad of larger problems with the film.Penelope Cruz's beauty and talent is completely wasted. Her character is so one dimensional you feel as if you can see through her. She is stereo-typically the ""wife"" in the ""wife"" or ""slut"" scenario to the point that she wears a cross necklace, talks about going to church, is hesitant to talk dirty to her lover and doesn't want to know the value of her diamond.There have been no early reviews for the film. Many wanted to believe that it was to refrain from plot spoilers and maintain an air of mystery. The truth is much less interesting. It's because this is a horrible film in every possible way.",The Counselor

I still don't know what this film was about. Thriller, I don't think so. This was more of a dark comedy. I just couldn't help but laugh at this film. The bad accents, bad acting, bad everything. I just kept saying Really, Really. The editing was poor. Everything seemed so random. I couldn't figure out why half the cast was even in the movie. There were a few spots where I thought, wow that's a great shot, that was actually good. Then the next scene would come and that memory would fade away.

422,christi_paulson,Sucked!,1,26 October 2013,"In my humble opinion, this movie SUCKED! I understand the symbolism and the plot, but it was awful! Brad Pitt had not much more than a cameo appearance. Why did he bother? The entire movie can be predicted by blatant foreshadowing. The acting was subpar, specifically Cameron Diaz. She is past her prime and is no longer selecting roles, but taking anything she can get. There was so much in this script that did not need to be there. That being said, there was a lot left out that should have been there. If you go to the movie expecting crap you will not be disappointed. If you go to the movie just because the guy you have been waiting to ask you out for two years does so, then it is worth it. If you watch the movie just so you can eat a bucket of buttery popcorn and drink a gallon of soda, then its worth it Knowing what I know now, I wouldn't even spend the $1.29 for the red box rental.

I am also a big fan of the movie versions of No Country for Old Men and The Road. I consider Brad Pitt to be one of our finest American actors and Javier Bardem has done some excellent work as well.With all this in mind, I was anticipating The Counselor to be superb.It wasn't.Yes, there were some amazing plot twists, gritty violence and good acting. Yes there was wisdom in some of the lines, especially by Ruben Blades and the diamond merchant in Amsterdam. But all in all, it is underwhelming. I could not buy into the motivations of the main character - the Counselor - and wanted to know why he needed to get involved in this deal in the first place. I assumed it was his lavish lifestyle (sports cars, tailored suits, 4-karat engagement rings, etc), but why not tell us? I ended up not really caring what happened to him. Brad Pitt did his best in a limited role, but there wasn't much there to sink his teeth into. Bardem was actually funny in a wasted and weirded-out way, but this was certainly no Anton Chigurh for him.Penelope Cruz and Cameron Diaz...meh. Michael Fassbender... meh.I don't know who to blame - the scriptwriter Cormac McCarthy or the director Ridley Scott. Probably both.",The Counselor

I couldn't figure out which country we were in from scene to scene. I watched three different couples walk out mid film and I was ready to leave within 45 min from the start myself out of boredom. I stayed because I was so impressed with the lineup of actors and figured this has got to get better. I thought I must be having a bad day, just watch. Well, I was wrong, it just sucked all the way to the end. And the ending, are you serious, did they pay so much for the lineup they couldn't afford writers to match the skill level of these actors?

Well...about 1 minute in me and my brother turned over to look at each other say ""Is this really necessary""? Unfortunately, that wasn't the last time we felt that way. This film has a great cast but had nothing to offer. Kind of like a coffee in the morning before work to give you some energy to start the day but there is no caffeine in it and it is 2 weeks old to boot. The Counselor felt like that. There was no plot and not only was there no plot, 99% of the time I didn't understand what was going on. No characters were explained at all, they just appeared and then if you were lucky enough left quickly. There was also so much unneeded sexual scenes/dialog, as well as a couple instances of incredibly graphic violence that just seemed to be too much. Now violence and sex do not bother me so much when it has a point, but there was just no point in this movie. The only regret I have is that me and my brother waited till about 10 minutes left in the film to leave the theater. After we left my friends who stayed for the entire film said how they wish they would have never even seen this movie. So unfortunate considering the director of this film has made so many great films.",The Counselor

The violence was just that - violent. There was no point to it. Very random movie all around. Seemed pretty pointless to have a high-paid actor like Brad Pitt in a movie when he had such an insignificant role - I am thinking they put him in the movie solely to attract viewers because there was nothing else attractive about the movie.Might I note, I am no movie expert, so if you are a hard-core movie person, you may enjoy it.

The suggestion in this film is that the cartel had these drugs stolen from them by competitors. But why would a cartel assemble a load of drugs, seal them in a waste truck and move them an inch without first having been paid for them? Why did the cartel risk moving drugs anywhere that had not been paid for upfront? The Chicargo mafia was the ultimate destination for the truck so why did the mafia not pay for the drugs and ship them north themselves. Why all the middlemen?

The nitro charged story and uber-chic characters, bring accessibility to this gruesome tale of a drug deal gone bad, although this movie is not for the fainthearted. I had visceral reactions to some scenes. The Counselor, played by Michael Fassbender, ironically, is the one needing advice after he becomes the prey of an relenting pursuer, scheming to intervene in a one-time drug deal he has set in motion. This deal, set up through Badem's and Pitt's characters, sees the Counselor's life spiraling out of control to a heart-rending climax.The Counselor's choice to enter into a world where he is unable to negotiate the brutal new rules, causes a devastating ripple effect through so many lives, even he is unaware of, until they are revealed. Westray: ""It's not that you're going down Counselor.. it's what's going down with you""The production must have been a stylist dream. Check-out some of the jaw dropping outfits hanging off Cameron Diaz and Badem's character.Hairstyles and fashion aside, this story demands we understand that our individual choices do affect others, that the world is connected with fine filaments, invisible to the human psyche. Choices we make every day, can affect others in ways we can't predict. I have no doubt that this film will become an iconic fable, representing the morality of the choices we make . The way the story is crafted, the dialogue, and the stylistic way the story has been told will last the test of time.The beauty of The Counselor is that, it's not until you step away from the film do you see the ""big"" picture.",The Counselor

What I saw tonight was a mixed up and disjointed plot with a lot of cool parts. There are great looking women, nice cars, cool action scenes, bizarre deaths and some really slimy characters. What I don't understand was why the Counsellor himself seemed so dumb. He acted totally unaware that he was dealing with the Juarez Cartel and some other pretty dangerous people. The look on his face was like a whimpering puppy for most of the movie. He has his sweet innocent girlfriend (Cruz) in a world where the mob rules and he acts like everything is OK. Cameron Diaz is bad but there wasn't really the sense of an evildoer behind all the action. Brad Pitt was OK in a Thelma and Louise sort of way; sexy cowboy.

Even Brad Pitt couldn't inspire, and I can't blame him. Like I mentioned: all dialogs were cold, and B-movie-like. Propably over-directed, and some of the scenes so ridiculous I asked myself where he got his inspiration from and what it actually contributed to the movie. Actually... nothing. Cameron Diaz is playing a slut who is trying to confess for the first time, and Penelope Cruz the most innocent catholic girl in the world who fell in the wrong hands. Brad Pitt is the crook who you saw in the A-team before and Fassbender... I don't what to think about him at all...

Since most movies aim at the 20 to 30 year old male movie goer, it is not a surprise that this movie is not doing well. To see a movie that takes you on a philosophical adventure is a rare occurrence, and certainly one that uses a vocabulary higher than a 12 year old might have. It is important that the viewer know in advance that every word is critical to the conclusion of the movie. The dialogue written by Pulitzer Winning, Cormac McCarthy, is so wonderfully tight, and it is more like observances than people discussing a topic. This is a true love story where the writer wants his audience to know that love is what life is about; not money; certainly not money from dealing drugs. It is a warning to those who neglect their lovers and choose a life where they worship things (not uncommon nowadays).

442,DrLovehate,"""They don't believe in coincidences""",8,13 March 2014,"Ridley Scott and Cormac McCarthy have created something different here and, like the line in my summary quoted from the movie, it's no coincidence that their collaboration resulted in a bleakly nihilistic film. Though not loved by many, there are vocal supporters of this film and I am one of them. As in all Ridley Scott pictures, the look of the film is impeccable. With a rich colour palate and solid cinematography we get a very visceral sense of the time and place that the story takes place in. If there is a weak link it's McCarthy's original screenplay which is elliptical and fragmented when the film could have been served just as well by a more linear approach. At it's most basic this is the story of a drug deal between American businessmen and the Mexican cartel that goes terribly wrong and proceeds to unflinchingly document the resulting fallout that ensnares everyone involved like a giant ticking bolito. None of the characters talk like normal people, but I'm OK with that. This is how McCarthy writes so you will either love it or hate it depending on what you get out of his style. The casting was excellent and I particularly enjoyed the cameos by several well known faces. I thought Cameron Diaz was excellent as the femme fatale. Her machinations are the stuff of every man's worst nightmare. Michael Fassbender made the perfect 'man out of his depth'. I lost count of the amount of times he said ""Jesus"" as the truth of his predicament settled over him like a suffocating fog. Brad Pitt continues to impress and I really enjoyed the jocular way he delivered his meditations on the reality of their increasingly grim situation. The only underdeveloped role in the film was without a doubt Penelope Cruz' character. Not her fault, there just wasn't much material for her to work with. I'm glad to see that Mr Scott is still unafraid to take risks, and even if this one didn't result in box office gold there is still much to savour. Overall, I give The Counselor an 8 out of 10.",The Counselor

And most of the times I can abide with the ratings. Not in this case however. Seeing that this movie is closer to the 6 than to a 4 I just had to register and rate this awful piece of pretentiousness.When a movie gives you the feeling that your intelligence is failing you - several times I wondered if this is what it feels to watch Pokemon at the age of 75 - , something must have gone horribly wrong. Judging by the cast, the director, the writer, the shots, the locations and the props it's fairly safe to say that it wasn't a matter of budget.The story itself has potential to be interesting, it is not super-original, but originality doesn't have to be the most important aspect of a good film. The way the story unfolds, or the characters develop can suck you in. But the pace of the movie (and I can enjoy slow movies very much so) is awful, the scenes are non-sensical and the dialogues are pompous.

Penelope Cruz was sweet and girlie... Javier Bardem just crazy - probably the most interesting character of all.

448,asturpin96,Not for the average moviegoer.,3,2 December 2013,"I was extremely disappointed that I spent two hours of my life watching this disjointed compilation of excessive dialogue, unnecessary scenes and unexplained characters appearing and disappearing without warning. In my view, the average person watching a movie, one who is looking to be entertained, will feel this movie is a major letdown. While most are not opposed to a thought provoking movie, and would even probably prefer a movie to have a message and to have interesting intellectual material, I believe this movie goes WAY too far in trying to weave in themes, metaphors and complex dialogue, at the expense of developing the plot and the characters in the movie to a satisfactory extent.Probably the best feature of the movie is the performances from its actors, in particular Brad Pitt, Javier Bardem and Michael Fassbender. However, while not a bad performance, the decision to cast Cameron Diaz as a woman from Barbados leads to a rather unconvincing performance in that respect. When she makes her few brief attempts to put on an accent it is rather laughable because she speaks with a plain American accent for the majority of the film. Aside from the accent, however, she does provide a reasonably good quality performance.However despite the attempts from the cast, the dialogue and scenes they are given to work with are strange and often simply irrelevant to the story as a whole. The bulk of the movie is made up of large chunks of dialogue between two characters, and one of the two characters is often in only one scene in the whole film, entering and leaving without any development or explanation. This dialogue consists of various extended metaphors and attempts at philosophy as characters present their own thoughts on life and the human condition. Unfortunately, at least in my view, it often comes across as simply trying far too hard to sound like the work of an advanced philosopher without being particularly convincing. There is no real core theme that is pushed more than others because each character provides different perspectives and metaphors.Overall, the movie comes across as disjointed and seems to have many plot holes and points requiring more explanation. I think the average viewer will regret wasting money and time watching the film. That said, if you're the type that enjoys movies which attempt to be more deep and less entertaining instead of finding a balance, it's probably worth giving it a watch and deciding for yourself. If you're not the type to be an intellectual snob about film, however, I would strongly recommend staying away from ""The Counsellor"".",The Counselor

I deferred from seeing the theatrical cut because it was so badly reviewed. McCarthys script is masterful, with more brilliant monologues than most writers will produce in a lifetime. Some of the philosophising feels a little empty, but the words are so perfect that this can be forgiven. The acting by the core cast is excellent. Bardem is the most consistently impressive, but the electric opening scene between Fassbender and Cruz is brilliant and Diaz has never been as good as she is in her closing monologue. Pitt never really shines, but he is effective. However, the show is stolen by the one offs: the diamond dealer delivering his monologue about God, culture and Judaism; the young biker extolling the merits of his fake dog food diet; Jefe preaching about grief and reality to the Counsellor. The visuals are not glossy and polished, but this is a beautifully shot film. It is shocking without being grotesque and sexy without being gratuitous. There a few scenes in here that will echo for years to come. To name a few: Diaz grinding on the Ferrari, Pitt wearing the bolo, Fassbender finding the snuff film. The closing shots, as the characters are eliminated one by one, should be enough to excuse the rest of the editing - which was sometimes clunky and confusing.In spite of all that is right with this film it feels slightly unfinished.

The screenplay by Cormack McCarthy, who also wrote No Country for Old Men shows insight with depth and poetic overtones. The original cinematic release doesn't make sense and is disjointed.

455,nemesisgds,"lengthy, wordy and depressing..",2,29 January 2014,"For one who is unprepared for what type of film this is,(like me) I recommend researching other movies done by this same writer and director. The trailer did not prepare me for the extensive dialogue, or how long it would take to get to any point. The whole movie up until the last 20 minutes was ( to me a failed attempt at) setting the stage for something really big , but then didn't deliver as much as it promised. Honestly the first half of the movie I was still waiting for the plot to become apparent. (might have been my own fault for not paying close enough attention) The character word play is lengthy and over the top-you MUST pay attention to it or you'll miss clues that tell you more to come in the story as it unfolds. If you don't listen closely, you will be miss loads of information, like the dark humor and irony as the actors remind you previous scenes that warned this would happen. In a way, this whole movie is one big ironic fist in your face. This is not the movie you put on for a date or typical family gathering. Watch it for the drama, the brilliant acting, and a story you won't soon forget, but don't expect to like it when its over. Expect heartbreak, despair and most of all -meaninglessness. I do have to give one great big AWESOME applause for Cameron Diaz. Her performance is the only one I will remember. and that face she wore throughout the whole movie. It was not what I expected of her from her previous films, it really fit the role fantastically.",The Counselor

I waited right up until the very end for the mess to take on some meaning or for the movie to actually start or to experience some form of entertainment, but to no avail. It was as if the script was written and directed by a child and even the actors convinced me that they have no experience whatsoever. Was it supposed to have some philosophical value of which I am not aware of or are the stars just becoming old and loosing their spark? I am sure rubbing your vagina on the windshield of a car has some intellectual value in Hollywood and that I just missed the point.",The Counselor

I was really looking forward to watching this as it had an amazing cast and the trailer made it look super entertaining; much to my surprise the actual movie was downright pathetic. I never thought I would say that Brad Pitt couldn't help the integrity of a flick. My issue with this movie is the ramblings from the characters, as well as the unnecessarily long scenes. It's impressive how the actors are able to memorize so many lines but COME ON! When one of the characters gets going they just go on and on and on and on. And not in simple English either - nope, they ramble like a modern version of Shakespeare. And the rambling lasts forever! It's like every character in this movie all have a masters in philosophy. BAH. If you wanna watch a movie - pick anything else. Literally anything. This movie will just leave feeling disappointed in the characters, the verbal diarrhea that never stops and the entire plot line.",The Counselor

I'm 35 years old and I can honestly say that this is the worst movie I have ever seen in my entire life. I am not just saying that. Seriously. It is the worst movie I have ever seen in my ENTIRE LIFE. I can appreciate the justice that the characters faced but I find it so unsatisfying as a human being. This movie flat out f@#*ing suc#ed. I think that the people that made it should receive the same punishment as the characters in the movie. I would like the 2 1/2 hours of my life I wasted on this film back. Ridley Scott you should be ashamed of yourself. I am so grateful that this movie bombed. I hope they all lose money. No wonder it went right to DVD. Man am I angry!,The Counselor
459,seikoappliance,Uniquely indifferent,6,3 February 2014,"I must say this was an interesting movie. With all the negative comments regarding dialogue, I find it necessary to say that we were never left to wonder too much about what was happening. Rather, the script was intelligent and well thought out. It had high hopes and great expectations with a full cast of great actors. Ultimately, in the end there were no great actors, no moments to shine but rather a great defeat on their part, for as it appeared to be senseless murder without any attempt to fight back. Without a doubt a unique film that breaks away from the average Hollywood release. I suppose if I were a woman I'd give this movie a rating of 10, as it downplays the ability to lead by men. However, I was left disappointed for the simple fact that a woman could never be clever enough to pull off such a scheme, alluding and ultimately insulting to men. While the storyline was at times poetically shocking, disturbing and brilliant, it lacks the intelligence and audacity of such great male actors, making Cameron Diaz the star of this film by default.",The Counselor
460,stephen-har50,Thriller NOT!,1,6 February 2014,"This films contains gratuitous sex that has nothing to do with the plot, poor Laura is so dis-satisfied with the Counselors love making she has to ask to be Finger F****** and all in the first 30 seconds of the film. Then we have Diaz open legged and pantie-less on the windscreen of a Ferrari while the submissive playboy boyfriend just sits watching the open legged and cum-ming Malkina (Diaz) messing up his windscreen. I should think this was enough to upset a few drugs cartels before we went through the shootouts with an Uzi that never needed reloading in a firefight that would have expended a truckload of ammo in the time it took to kill three men and make one as lame as the film.Then we have the Bolo what a nice little device, we had better all carry wire-cutters in the future just in case the Cartel should get upset with us. OK the message was clear though no-one has picked up on it, drug users are really the cause of the violence and mayhem caused by drugs, just like downloading porn creates porn, though we never actually saw any, apart from in barrels in packets but it could have been anything, the joke dead body in a barrel caused a few heaving laughs, must be a cartel in joke. Then we had Greed, Lust, Murder, Revenge, in bucket loads, Yup the Bolo strangling garroting device probably cost about £100,000 a piece and was evidently made by a first class watchmaker like a Killer Rolex but one you could only use once, still these drugs barons are loaded everywhere but in the brain department. So my summation of this terrible film including very obvious glimpses of Diaz's mouth smileys that were a product of some expensive plastic surgeon in upper class Hollywood, which made Diaz look like the Joker what a pity she didn't lose her head like the Green Hornet in that old familiar way. The rabid violent Mexican underclass in all its gory glory. In-Glorious rubbish, like taking a mega dump in the Hyde Park Serpentine for no other reason than you could.

461,dstephan-917-612756,Very misunderstood film,9,7 February 2014,"This film is not for those who like to have things tidily explained for them. It's for those who reserve judgment and figure out what it means for themselves. My understanding is that this is a ""slice of life"" film which is only comprehensible after the final curtain. Imagine you're a fly on a wall. You can hear people speaking but you don't know who they are or what brought them to this point unless they reveal it to you in their conversations. You don't get to choose which walls you land on but you can piece together meaning from what you've heard and witnessed. This is, I believe, the modus operandi of this film. All you really need to know is that one person ends up out on top at the end. In short, this is the film that Walter White should have seen before he decided to break bad.I particularly enjoyed the scene where the ""Green Hornet"" talks with a civilian at a roadside stand about his ""dog food diet."" The civilian starts up the conversation and there's nothing he says that's particularly threatening to her but you can see in her face that she's increasingly terrified by him but is trapped in carrying on what is nothing but small talk.

By doing this, much of the details about whats happening and how the situation escalated were simply left out.

The desert cinematography is convincing and puts you in the throws of Mexico and its drug middlemen. I did not experience a Ridley Scott directorial signature. This had ""made for TV"" written all over it. Javier Bardem's performance stands out as a flamboyant drug kingpin whose calculating and sinister wife (aging sexy Diaz) masterminds the ultimate betrayal. Fessbender the main protagonist fights for his life both literally and in terms of performance among a cast of heavyweights and is a bit out of his league. Terrible plot structure lacking a convincing climax, motive or resolution. Without giving it away the bad guys win here.

IMDb has been my trusted source for opinions on film etc for many many years and after watching this jewel of a film I thought it time to finally let something out as well.I'm no critic nor do I have a lot of understanding of what film making ""should"" be. All I know comes from certain emotions some films evoke and some don't.This film, for me, did the same as ""Killing them softly"" did. A feeling of sheer enjoyment and the pleasure of watching pure craftsmanship. This film oozes style, cool, and visual splendor. This combined with a great story of inevitability and some amazing performances: Never seen Cameron Diaz better then this and Michael Fassbender can't do anything wrong in my opinion anyway, makes for a tantalizing look into a downright evil and pretty much moral less bit of world we will only ever see in movies (at least most of us). I loved it and have the urge to see something similar... There isn't. Yes, you can definitely feel a vibe similar to that of ""No country for old men"", one of my absolute favorite films of all time. And even a bit of ""Fargo"" maybe, but in no way is this copycat material. For me it stands alone as a solid beautiful if bleak tragedy disguised as a slick mean thriller.Check it out.

McCarthy warns us that these forces are intrinsically woven into our everyday lives, yet we choose not to accept it, avoiding the harsh truth that we are all witness to and therefore part of the horrors that happen in the world.Whether buying diamonds born of savage war or partaking in drug use and fueling the violence in Mexico, this movie is a slap inn the face to the human race.Those looking to be entertained won't find it here. I am amazed to see an overall rating of 5.5 as the Counsellor is quite brilliant.

Its just that i never felt a connection to the movie or with any characters and i didn't feel frankly that they had a connection with each other. Between some of the best scenes i have ever seen, the concrete that keeps these scenes together is full of mixed up messy speeches and total confusion in my mind.Throughout the movie i sat and quizzed myself continuously whether i truly liked the movie. There are some scenes such as when the cartel come and chase down the guy (trying to avoid spoilers) or when that guy dies with the weapon that he mentions at the start as a rumor he heard. Speaking about it, the second i heard about that device i was hoping all movie to see it and the longer it went on, the more desperate i became. When i did finally get to see it, it was ""bloody"" worth it.

Maybe this movie didn't make as big an impact as No Country for Old Men but it's of the same cloth and equal or greater to in terms of quality.

Been waiting for this kinda film for years.From the beginning, i got intrigued by the opening rather long scene which is not usually elaborated on in Hollywood Films. I was anticipating action and more violence however started to feel the scenes were slowing the film down.The scenes of philosophical dialogue were difficult to comprehend if you weren't listening carefully to the audio. The dialogues were too intense to immediately comprehend due to various interpretations of history and hearsay. This is not the kinda film for those whom haven't lived the high life or been on the edge. I felt the film lacked mega action however seemed to concentrate on an onslaught of philosophical dialogue between the Counselor himself and his fellow protagonists in the film. I didn't realise this was going to be the case prior to watching the film.I feel it would be better to watch the film on your own in a dark room away from everyone. Its that kinda film. You may not understand it straight away. I wish the dialogue was not quoted so fast and for so long but i think this is Ridley Scotts characteristic of the film. In light of his brother Tony Scotts suicide-perhaps this film was an emotional consequence and relevance of what the last days of ones life can come to when you have it ALL. I think the message of this film is a portrayal and reality check from knowing the fact that from when 'Your Time is Up' and no matter what you do.. Your definitely Marked for Death and there is nothing in the world you can do about it. The film must be credited for its on set locations, real life portrayals of bandits, deception, double crossing and criminal code. The film is not too far fetched from reality in my opinion however i was quite impressed with Cameron Diaz's character portrayal.

I suppose that's why this film's rating is as low as it is, such capacities were nonexistent or suspended. Audiences these days want and expect to be served a spotless silver platter of simplicity, where tits, ass, explosions, and fight scenes are diced up and served by young, hip, hot-for-the-moment actors, and none of which is to be mixed with a meaningful message. Here, in this film, you get all those pretty-little silver platter pieces, but they're served by veterans, seasoned and ready-made to use all those pieces as accessories to pull in such viewers and drive home the message McCarthy has lined with silver here--dark and bleak as it may be. Those viewers probably loved the ""car f+@&ing"" scene, but loathed the scene where El Jefe breaks down reality with truth, parables, and poetry ... I can only assume. I've never once written a movie review, but I did so now because I was compelled to say that this film is absolutely brilliant.",The Counselor

488,ddweiss-04233,Very Misunderstood but a work of art,8,1 August 2015,"Cormac McCarthy also wildly known for No Country... spins an original yarn where at the end of the day nobody wins. Evil will be hunted, anticipated roads to quick wealth are vanquished and greed is overcome with grief. There is so much nuance going on in every scene that The Counselor takes the viewer on a ride where nothing can be anticipated. The character development is deep and rewarding with a dynamic complexity and gross misunderstanding. The reason I believe for so many other low reviews is that the typical viewer does not take the time to go along for the ride and be taken to places where they'd rather not be dragged. The plot can be confusing IF you are not paying attention. This is not a casual film to be thrown on with friends. This is a move that requires your full attention because one missed piece of dialogue will be the undoing of the complete story. The Counselor will drag you deep into the drug cartels and further down into the depths of oh my God,,, why, why, why! We are set up early in the film in Amsterdam where the brilliance of a diamond reflects the love the counselor has for the love of his life. As we understand the bond this sets up the fatal mistakes to come. Out for a fast and easy buck? Not likely! The naiveté of where the counselor is going and what is to come makes for some very intense scenes. The full insanity of Malkina comes at the golf course when we are largely treated to a scene never before seen in any film. With pure lust comes pure evil and we can see how unsettled Reiner (Bardem) has become in reliving the tale. At this point we're all pretty sure that Reiner is screwed and he believes he is too. The level of foreshadow in this film is amazing and wonderful leading us to bleak despair. Ridley Scott is among the worlds great directors and cinematographers with a keen ability to bring us into any world possible. His shot choices and editing are always at the top of the game. Forget subtle continuity errors and go along for the ride of your life as a great cast takes you fast and deep into another Cormac McCarthy tale full of twists, turns and mayhem.",The Counselor
489,neilmak-72199,A Modern Morality Tale,8,25 October 2015,"Can you dabble in evil and not be tainted by it? Can you inhabit the periphery of criminality, make money, and come out unscathed? This story says not. The lines are not realistic and are not meant to be. The main players are homespun philosophers conscious of their own criminality and seem aware of having chosen evil. The Brad Pitt character recognizes that the lawyer (Fassbender) is essentially a decent man, who is at that critical turning point. Some vestige of goodness in Pitt's character prompts him to advise against adopting the criminal way. Michael Fassbender is competent in the lead, Brad Pitt's performance is nicely judged and Cameron Diaz is a treat as the archetypal bitch, the Evil Queen. But overall, Javier Bardem is the standout in a solid ensemble cast. Look beneath the surface, pay attention to plot clues which explain later events, and you'll get something satisfying out of this. Either you get it, or you don't. Those who didn't, gave it one star... ;-)",The Counselor

Film makers of this movie tried too hard to make this movie ""deep"", with all the heavy conversations between the counselor and his friends or the mysterious cartel people. It could have been made much better with the team they put together. The mixing of sex, drugs, and murdering was so unsuccessful, like someone setting up a dinner table with a mix of Indian dishes, Mexican food, French dishes. Scenes were jumping from one to another, and the story line was questionable. Why Malkina not the cartels chased down Westray? If she was so capable, how did she lose her truck? Why the cartels didn't kidnap her as they did to the counselor's wife Laura? Which cartel group killed the ""wireman"" and took the truck, the same one who prepared the truck? And the mysterious device from the truck....I know some movies leave questions to the audience at the end, but this one? Not the same.",The Counselor
492,yvantonov,One world.,10,31 March 2017,"One of the most underrated films of 2013. A film with a subtext about the acute world problem. If you look at the film superficially, then everything is just a story similar to the punched films of Gaia Richey, but the lack of voice-over, explaining the audience in the films of Gaia and so not an intricate story. Can make you look at the film under a different ""angle,"" you start to peer at the film, search, then what is invested in it. Although the film looks slightly in what is not finished, it probably happened because of the tragedy in the family of Ridley Scott. This does not cancel out the pros of the picture. If we consider the film as a thriller, then it is necessary to evaluate very relevant musical inserts, forcing the atmosphere ""the atmosphere of the approaching train"", the excellent game of Javier Bardem and not the bad game of other actors. I regard this film as social in which my attention was drawn to the problem of the value of life in the countries in which people are forced to survive, due to the connivance of the government, and these countries are exploited by the governments of the more developed states, ultimately militants and criminals from less developed countries become a problem Countries ""exploiters"". In the scene of choosing a stone, the adviser is told about finding faults in the stones, which is the essence of the jewelry business, and about the desire to come into contact with the fate of the stone of the person who chose it. The further actions of the adviser and are shortcomings in the business, in which he falls due to greed and carelessness, he is the drawback that will lead him and all whose people he will drag along with himself to the tragic end. The adviser and his lover are the only living in the center of a monolithic stone system. Do not make a counselor a good deed for your client, thereby creating a flaw in a non-clean deal, things could have been different, but there would be an outcome to others. This question leaves an open conversation at the end of the adviser's film with the head of the cartel, and an illustration of a corpse in a barrel sent Together with drugs. After all, criminals living in the country on the brink of survival, where the government has drug cartels and corruption is flourishing, where they shoot and then look at whom they shot, they think quite differently ...",The Counselor

495,soupermusickc,A flawed gem,7,22 July 2017,"This is not a synopsis, it is a reflection of my experience watching The Counsellor.I've just watched The Counsellor for the 3rd time, and for the 1st time decided that I like it.So if I didn't like it the 1st 2 times, why did I watch it for a 3rd time?Well, have you looked at the credits? I should probably start by saying that IMHO, P. Cruz is endlessly watchable, and Brad, Javier and Cameron run her pretty close. This is also a film from the guys who brought you Alien, Blade Runner, No Country for Old Men and The Road. There's a Fassbender involved.But... good movie making is notoriously ephemeral, just one moment can lose an audience irretrievably, and on first watch, this movie lost me. More than once.And yet... just a couple of great scenes can elevate a film, and this film has many brain- searing moments. Those sort of things stay with you, which is probably why I watched it the 2nd time. Maybe that time it became a little clearer, I could let the words worm their way in, and the images and cinematography wash over me without the anxiety that I was missing something. Wow, don't cheetahs loping out of a car and over a dead Bardem look cool? How brutal and breath catchingly denial-denying is that soliloquy from the cartel boss? How Shakespearean the story arc? But I still couldn't like it, because despite all of this, the story was still distant, the details unclear, scenes strewn like spare jigsaw pieces.Maybe this film's reputation will grow in the online future, where gaming shows the way, and the participant is consulting the online guide as they enjoy the experience. As soon as this film started to lose me on the 3rd watching, I consulted the Wikipedia Plot details, and yes, it's all there in the film. It's actually a fairly straightforward, dark, hard story, although I have to say, I think the editing decisions did not serve it well. Hitchcock used to talk about the need to engage an audience and play with their expectations, and I feel this is what is missing from this film. I would have preferred scenes that made it clearer that there was a connection between Diaz's character and the on-road shenanigans, and even on which side the male protagonists were when it came to the road warriors. The road scenes are fantastic as it happens, but they seem almost adrift from the main protagonists' plans. As impressively flexible as Cameron is, and as funny as Bardem's conversation with Pitt is, rather than the car humping and the confession scenes, find a way to expose Cameron's character while engaging with the story, whether that be to advance it or throw a curve ball. Another example, having Cameron allude to the importance of possessing 'the computer' is not sufficient to ratchet the tension that the build up to Pitt's demise deserved. We are still wondering what happened to the drugs, there is already a price on Pitt's head and we don't realise that Cameron is after his case. I suspect that there was a desire to have Cameron's involvement appear as a reveal of sorts, but there appears to be so much going on that by the end of the film, it is not even clear that it is a denouement, unless you've seen it before.To the filmmakers involved, the final cut probably seemed un-needing of further exposition. In that case, what harm could come from including a few of their favourite scenes? It seems to me that this film suffers from too many good scenes, and not enough empathy for an audience's moment by moment engagement. These are structural faults, which could have been addressed in the script or film edits. TBH, as much as I love Ridley Scott's films, this is a weakness which is not a complete surprise. It is just a shame that this flaw afflicted what could have been a D grade diamond of a film (I learnt from this film that D is a good grade for a diamond). It still shines, it's just a bit too much flash over structure. It feels like a film on the brink of greatness. After the 3rd watch.",The Counselor

Although two hours are not enough to clarify details and reveal the case. This film story is complex and enigmatic, but must be squeezed into movie theater time-frame jar, unfortunately..

497,colindbrown-40510,Humanity's Heart of Darkness,9,7 September 2017,"Despite the many negative reviews, I think 'The Counselor' is an excellent film overall and probably one of Ridley Scott's best films. Cormac McCarthy has written a highly poetic, literary, and philosophic screenplay that explores humanity's heart of darkness: drug trafficking (which relates to arms trafficking and human/sex trafficking), greed, vanity, extreme violence, social Darwinism, survival of the fittest, etc.Philosophically, the film is extremely dark, perhaps the darkest movie I have ever seen, reminiscent of '8MM,' 'Apocalypse Now,' and 'No Country for Old Men.' In this film, the most evil people prevail and the less evil people are hunted and devoured. The counselor's fiancée, Laura (Penelope Cruz), represents innocence, virtue, and Christian faith and yet she ends up getting abducted, decapitated, raped, and discarded in a landfill. Then the counselor (Michael Fassbender) receives a DVD snuff film starring his fiancée.In contrast, Malkina (Cameron Diaz) represents the strong, ruthless, merciless, manipulative, Darwinian predator. She has cheetah-print tattoos on her back and two pet cheetahs. In her dialogues with Laura and the Catholic priest, she taunts her prey. Even though she sets into motion a plan to steal a Mexican drug cartel's shipment of cocaine, which fails, she evades their attention and ends up prospering. In the end, she celebrates her success and concludes the following:""The hunter has grace, beauty, and purity of heart to be found nowhere else. You can make no distinction between what they are and what they do. And what they do is kill. We, of course, are another matter. It is our faintness of heart that has driven us to the edge of ruin. Perhaps you won't agree, but nothing is crueler than a coward. And the slaughter to come is probably beyond our imagining.""In other words, we humans should cease with our ""faintness of heart"" and cowardice (e.g. morality and compassion) and embrace social Darwinism and survival of the fittest. The strong should dominate and prey on the weak (e.g. the innocent, virtuous, and faithful). They should embrace their status as predators. After all, in Malkina's view, if you do not embrace social Darwinism, you will just end up being slaughtered by someone who does embrace that worldview and acts effectively. In that sense, for those who are weak-willed or weak- stomached, the ""slaughter to come is probably beyond our imagining.""Overall, Malkina is a narcissistic, Machiavellian sociopath or psychopath and thus embodies the ""Dark Triad"" traits. Adolf Hitler, Heinrich Himmler, and other leading Nazis also demonstrated these Dark Triad traits, and they often appealed to social Darwinism when trying to justify their war-mongering and their Final Solution: the systematic extermination of 11 million Jews, gypsies, blacks, homosexuals, etc.However, one should never forget that Hitler and many other leading Nazis came to a bad end (e.g. suicide or the death penalty) and that the Nazis absolutely failed to achieve their ultimate objectives: defeat communism, conquer the entire continent of Europe (including Britain), and create a thousand-year Reich (German empire). In the long term, the Nazis sabotaged and destroyed themselves. Similarly, quite often, Machiavellian sociopaths or psychopaths like Malkina (or the high-level cartel members) end up destroying themselves or being destroyed (i.e. murdered). Arguably, this shows that extreme social Darwinism, sociopathy, and psychopathy are unsustainable, counterproductive, and self-defeating in the long term. Contrary to the film, evil or at least evil individuals do not prevail in the long term. As Martin Luther King Jr. said, ""The arc of the moral universe is long, but it bends towards justice.""In conclusion, I consider 'The Counselor' an excellent, literary, philosophic film with very dark themes. If you are seriously depressed or having mental health issues, I strongly recommend that you avoid this film. It can be difficult to digest even if you are a mature, mentally sound adult. Figuratively, it punches you in the gut. As Westray (Brad Pitt) says, ""I've pretty much seen it all, Counselor, and it's all s***.""",The Counselor
498,Stefanos-Pyrgos,"Great movie, not for every taste",8,1 February 2014,"I watched this movie last night, had seen the trailer a few times and I have to admit it was a lot different than expected. Its a slow dialog- based film, and many times you 'll find yourself for them to just stop speaking and move along. But right there is the true beauty of this film hidden. I think what Ridley Scott wanted to make is not another action flick with many Hollywood stars, but a slow paced-character driven tale of sin & justice with a slow pace that grows faster and faster until the end. The humor is also there, but its kinda twisted and hidden between lines, letting you wonder if you should laugh or not.
