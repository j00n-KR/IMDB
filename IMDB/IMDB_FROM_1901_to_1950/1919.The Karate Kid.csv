0,TheLittleSongbird,I liked it,7,2 August 2010,"Before people question me, yes I have seen the 1984 film and I like it very much. I was not sure whether I wanted to see this remake. Now I have seen some good remakes like Thief of Baghdad, and some awful ones like Psycho, and I was worried that The Karate Kid would turn out like Psycho or The Wicker Man. Also I saw a lot of hate for The Karate Kid even before it got released, people criticising Jaden Smith and that it would ruin the original.After seeing it with my family, I actually liked this. It isn't brilliant, but it is much better than people make it out to be on here. The story is very loose and updated with the bully theme still intact along with a love interest, and while it wasn't boring or bad as such it didn't always wow or excite me. I also felt the beginning dragged a bit, but my main flaw is the length, at two-and-a-half hours it was much too long.However, the pacing overall is snappy and the scripting was credible. The Karate Kid is also assuredly directed, while the score is beautiful, the scenery is absolutely stunning and the kung fu is amazing. And contrary to what others have said the acting wasn't that bad I thought. Jaden Smith surprised me. Admittedly I was worried, I feared he was too small and too young for the role, but he handles the choreography well and actually shows some acting range. Jackie Chan was a surprise too. I do prefer Pat Morita's more wiser and sympathetic Miyagi, but Chan does do some incredible stunts and showed real emotion in the touching scene when he smashes up the car and tells Dre the story of the woman and child. Taraji P.Henson is also credible, Zhenwei Wang is a great Cheng and Wenwen Han was lovely and cute as Meiying.Overall, for a remake The Karate Kid was not that bad. It isn't brilliant, but it could have been worse. 7/10 Bethany Cox",The Karate Kid
1,Leofwine_draca,Bland reworking of the original,4,24 April 2013,"While it does its best with the source material, and strives to be an engaging, character-focused drama, THE KARATE KID is nothing more than a bland reworking of the original classic that misses the mark on more than one occasion. The first film was all heart; this one's about attitude, and not much else besides.It's not often I watch a film and cheer on the bad guys, but are the bullies in this film really so bad? In fact, the erstwhile lead, played by the bratty Jaden Smith, seems worse than his adversaries, deliberately provoking them and bringing himself a great deal of pain in the process. Smith fails to garner a moment's sympathy for his character's plight throughout the production, appearing to be a typical spoilt rich kid instead.Now, the real reason I watched this film was for Jackie Chan, and needless he doesn't disappoint with his mentor role here. Sadly, though, Chan has little to do; his mentor schtick is good, but he's kept in the background for too long and also limited to a single fight scene, where he beats up a gang of children; hardly bathing in glory. I understand that a bout between Chan and screen rival Rongguang Yu was excised from the final print, which is a real shame. Who casts Jackie in a movie and REDUCES his fight scenes? The rest of the film is overlong and overblown, with needless romantic sub-plots that drag the running time down to a snail's pace and all the usual fish-out-of-water nonsense. The fight choreography is poor, too, with the climactic tournament scenes particularly disappointing and dealt with in a perfunctionary way. I'd rather watch the original, or something like Van Damme's BLOODSPORT, again.",The Karate Kid
2,SnoopyStyle,Can't stand the kid (character),4,28 September 2014,"Dre Parker (Jaden Smith) is leaving his friends in Detroit behind as he follows his mother Sherry (Taraji P. Henson) to Beijing. Mr. Han (Jackie Chan) is the maintenance man in their building. Dre falls for classmate Mei Ying but it's a problem for the class bully Cheng who starts picking on her. He comes to the rescue only to be beaten down. Then it's non-stop bullying from Cheng and his friends. After Dre plays a prank, the kids chase him down and Mr. Han rescues him. It turns out that Mr. Han is secretly a kung fu master.Jaden Smith comes off as a bratty kid and Taraji as a nagging mom. Normally I try not to be too hard on child actors, but the movie is putting him out there as the lead. The kid lacks the charisma of his father which is sorely needed because the character is such an annoying brash brat. He's all talk and such a boy stereotype. I like some the sly comedy. It opens up with Jackie Chan and a fun recall to the original. I like him as the new mentor but I really can't stand the kid. A lot of it has to be the character. It really wouldn't hurt the movie if he picked up his jacket from the very start. It serves no purpose for him to be a brat. It would be so much better that if he holds a deeper inner anger than an outwardly brashness. The mother nags too much which gets annoying after awhile. I really like the girl who isn't just a simplistic girlfriend character. The bully is very one dimensional. While I like Jackie Chan's attempt at humor, I didn't like his first fight in the movie to be against a bunch of kids.",The Karate Kid
3,kosmasp,It's Kung Fu,6,24 October 2010,"And I had to put it in the summary just to make sure, you are not appalled by the movie after the first ""contact"" with the martial arts at hand. Why they named it Karate Kid? Obviously because it is a Remake. But why not use Karate then? I guess Kung Fu is more aggressive whereas Karate is more a form of defending yourself. Both have a philosophy you can wrap your head around though.And just to say that too;' I'm not an expert in Martial Arts (anything but), just did a bit of Karate training as a teenager. But pulling Jackie Chan into the movie, who revealed in interviews, that when he first got offered the movie, thought he'd play the Karate Kid, was a major stunt. Though Jackie was kidding of course, I do believe him that he still feels much like a child. He has the passion and everything that moves him into making movies.And I have to admit that I thought Jayden actually did a pretty decent job here. I smashed his ""performance"" in the ""Day the Earth stood still"" Remake, but here he is very naturally. Maybe that is because it is closer to his real persona or maybe he does have a future in front of him, who knows. On the other hand, I'm aware that quite a few people hate him in this one too. It will be pretty clear from the first few minutes in what direction your feelings go.I haven't seen the Original Karate Kid in quite a few years, so I can't compare and/or say how much better or worse either movie is. Nostalgia would make me say, that the Original is better, but everyone has their own memories of the movie (if they've seen it), so it's up to you to decide, if you want to jeopardize that memory (if there is one to jeopardize ... if not, read a few more reviews to decide which movie, you wanna watch first).",The Karate Kid
4,jboothmillard,The Karate Kid,6,14 February 2011,"I really liked the first original film, and I obviously saw the sequels as well, but I was actually very interested to see if they could remake the film well, especially with the good choice of acting talent, from director Harald Zwart (One Night at McCol's, Agent Cody Banks). Basically twelve year old Dre Parker (The Pursuit of Happiness's Jaden Smith, son of Will and Jada Pinkett) and his mother Sherry (The Curious Case of Benjamin Button's Taraji P. Henson) have moved from Detroit to Beijing, China with her new career. It takes a little getting used to for Dre, but he has instantly found a love interest in Chinese music student and new school classmate Mei Ying (Wenwen Han), but he has also gained an enemy from this. Class bully Cheng (Zhenwei Wang) doesn't want Dre anywhere near Mei Ying, their families are close, and so begins a nasty amount of beatings between the two, with Dre easily beaten. Dre really has a go at his mother that they should never have moved, he has no friends and no way to escape the bullying, but he gains an unlikely new friend in repair man Mr. Han (Jackie Chan). After helping Dre by fending off the bullies, he initially refuses to teach him any moves to help defend himself, but changes his mind after the strict teacher Master Li (Rongguang Yu), who beats his students teaching them ""no mercy"", challenges him to enter Dre in a karate tournament. The moves start off with him just taking off his jacket, putting it on a peg, dropping it, picking up, putting it on again, and repeating this, basically, ""jacket on, jacket off"", but soon enough Mr. Han brings the real punches and kicks. Dre is a very quick learner, he even goes to the Wudang Mountains to learn the true ways of a master of the arts, he also manages to get Mei Ying back on side, who dumped him when her parents disapproved, they keep their promise to watch each other do their stuff. So the big tournament has arrived, the bullies have been told by Master Li that they could not touch Dre until this time, but of course he beats all his opponents too go against his real rival Cheng, who also makes the final fight. Master Li gives the order to Cheng to break Dre's leg, but in the end, this isn't enough, and of course Dre goes on to win the fight with that memorable kick, gaining praise from the audience, Mei Ling, his mother, and of course Mr. Han. Also starring Zhensu Wu as Meiying's Dad, Zhiheng Wang as Meiying's Mom and Jared Minns as Dre's Detroit Friend. Obviously Noriyuki 'Pat' Morita was nominated the Oscar as the original version's teacher, but Chan does actually create a just as wise and likable teacher, Smith is also pretty impressive as the new ""kid"" of the film. There are not too many similarities to the original version, not just because of the film's setting and the fact that what is actually being taught in the film is technically Kung Fu, it is a well done remake martial arts adventure. Good!",The Karate Kid
5,ma-cortes,"Nice remake about martial arts with a splendid duo , Jaden Smith and Jackie Chan .",6,8 August 2011,"Here is introduced a new kid , Jaden Smith, with the veteran coacher Jackie Chan .

This heartwarming picture will appeal to Karate Kid trilogy fans.",The Karate Kid
6,BA_Harrison,"Jacket On, Jacket Off.",7,23 January 2011,"I saw the original The Karate Kid at the cinema when it first came out and it's been a firm favourite of mine ever since (I even managed to meet the real Mr Miyagi, Pat Morita, shortly before he died), so when I heard that a remake was in the works, featuring KUNG FU legend Jackie Chan and Will Smith's kid, I feared the worst. They were bound to screw this one up...Having just watched the remake, I can safely say that the original remains the superior film (nostalgia clouding my judgement? Impartial little old moi?) but stand on one leg and kick me in the head if I didn't actually enjoy Harald Zwart's version more than just a little bit. Jackie's Mr Han is certainly no Miyagi, but he can still kick ass when needed and Jaden Smith gives a convincing performance as the little runt taught that the secret to martial arts success is to practise taking your jacket on and off (he does a mean splits too!)—the pair have great chemistry on screen and together they do an admirable job in bringing the story to a new audience.Yes, as unlikely as it might seem, The Karate Kid 2010 delivers the goods in most departments: the characters are likable, the cinematography is great, there's a great montage sequence (if there hadn't been, I would have complained) and a funny in-joke with Chan looking like he's about to catch a fly with his chopsticks before squishing it with a fly-swat, and the final tournament is a lot of fun (ridiculous, formulaic, crowd pleasing Hollywood fluff, perhaps, but still very entertaining).I still don't understand why they had to change Karate to Kung Fu, the setting to China, and Italian American teen Daniel into an African American twelve year old, but I'm glad that in doing so, they didn't make a complete hash of proceedings.",The Karate Kid
7,paul_haakonsen,Unbelievable. Just unbelievable...,2,21 August 2010,"Hand on heart, then I watched this movie solely for the fact that Jackie Chan was in it.You might like this 2010 version of ""The Karate Kid"" if you haven't seen the original movie. But for me, then this movie was unnecessary. It shouldn't have been title ""The Karate Kid"". Change the storyline and call it something else entirely. There are certain things you shouldn't meddle with, and remaking old classic movies is one such thing.Now what was good about this remake was the fact that it took place in China, so it made the whole concept a bit more believable than what was actually the case in the original ""Karate Kid"" movie. And also there was a heap of really nice images in the movie, that really caught the spirit of China and Chinese culture. That worked really well in favor for the movie.As for the acting, well I thought most actually did a good job. I am a fan of Jackie Chan, but I found this movie (a long with ""The Spy Next Door"") to be a notch down in his usual performances. And what was up with the expression constantly on the face of the ""bad"" kid, the one who had the grudge against Dre? He looked like he was constantly fighting off a bad constipation. As for Jaden Smith's performance, well truth be told, that was not in my liking at all. Sure his acting was adequate, but his Kung Fu? Not so much alright.One thing that really should have been cut from the movie was the scene where Dre and Meiying was at the arcade and dancing! What was up with that? First of all, they weren't even looking at the screen of the game to see what plates to put their feet on (as you usually need to do in such games), and secondly I think a girl of that age was WAY too young to be showing off a dance of that nature. What the... That would even have put Britney Spears to shame. That was utter nonsense and such a crack in the movie.Of course, even if you are familiar with the original ""Karate Kid"" movie or not, you knew the outcome of the movie a mile away. It is so obvious in these types of movies. And it was quite amazing that a newcomer to China learn Kung Fu in such a short time, and amazingly enough manages to defeat another child who most likely had been practicing Kung Fu since he was able to walk. That part really doesn't go well with me. It is just too much over the top.You might like a movie of this if you are a young boy and if you like action Kung Fu movies with a super sassy storyline. But for a grown up and people having seen the original movie, this movie should not be taken seriously. It is a lame attempt at breathing life back into a classic movie, and the result, well it was not all that great.I have seen it now, and can honestly say that I will not be watching it again, not even Jackie Chan could manage to save this movie.",The Karate Kid
8,tavm,This recent version of The Karate Kid seems to have as much impact as the original in entertainment value,9,15 July 2010,"While it's been a bit more than 25 years since I saw The original Karate Kid in its entirety, I recognized many similarities between that and the remake I just watched such as the tragic secret Mr. Han reveals while drunk or the injuries suffered by Dre during the climatic tournament. There were also some noticeable differences-other than the setting and the age of the protagonist-like the way Dre and Mei Ying were temporarily kept apart compared to what happened to Daniel and Ali in the original. Since it's been so long having watched the '84 version, I really can't make direct comparisons. All I can say is that I really liked this reimagining of that previous hit enough to once again get totally involved in the story, the characters, and overall atmosphere of the movie especially the Chinese location shots. I felt there was great chemistry between young Jaden Smith and Jackie Chan, not to mention between Smith and Taraji P. Henson as his mother, and that of him and Wenwen Han as his initial crush Mei Ying who becomes his girlfriend. Add in the direction by Harold Zwart and the score by James Horner and this version of The Karate Kid (though I agree that it should have been called The Kung Fu Kid) seemed just as compelling to watch as that original I saw so long ago.",The Karate Kid
9,michaelRokeefe,Much awaited re-make.,6,5 November 2010,"This re-make of the original 1984 smash hit has been fueled by the fact that the star is Will Smith's young son Jaden. The talented young Smith plays Dre Parker, a 12-year-old that must move from Detroit to China with his mother(Taraji P. Henson), who has accepted a job transfer. No sooner than he can start school in Beijing, Dre is victim of a brutal beating by a bully. Dre hates the move to China; the only bright spot is a powerful crush on a pretty classmate and violin prodigy(Wenwen Han). Dre will face his bully(Zhenwei Wang)in a national karate tournament after intense training from handyman Mr. Han(Jackie Chan). A warm and fuzzy film and positive mood elevator. The young Smith and Chan appear to have a mutual appreciation for the other; the character relationship is admirable. Fun movie.",The Karate Kid
10,sunwarrior13,A Great Remake,9,28 October 2011,"The Karate Kid may not be as powerful as the 1984 version, but it delivers a surprisingly satisfying update on the original.In fact,I even consider the remake better than the original film.The movie is remake of the 1984 film of the same name that stars Jaden Smith and Jackie Chan.The plot concerns a 12-year-old boy from Detroit who moves to China with his mother and runs afoul of the neighborhood bully. He makes an unlikely ally in the form of his aging maintenance man, Mr. Han, a kung fu master who teaches him the secrets to self- defense.It was produced by Will and Jada Pinkett Smith,parents of Jaden Smith and directed by Harald Zwart.The story of The Karate Kid starts when a 12-year-old from Detroit moves to China with his mother and incurs the wrath of the class bully at his new school, he makes an unlikely ally in the form of his aging maintenance man, a kung fu master who teaches him the secrets to self- defense. Upon arriving at his new school, Dre Parker,portrayed by Jaden Smith develops a powerful crush on pretty classmate Mei Ying. The feeling is mutual, although the cultural divide between Dre and Mei Ying makes a friendship unlikely, and romance impossible. When cruel classmate and kung fu prodigy Cheng learns of Dre's feelings for Mei Ying, he harasses and humiliates the young outsider in front of the entire school. With no one to turn to for help, Dre confides his fears in kindly maintenance man Mr. Han,played by Jackie Chan, a kung fu master who knows that serenity and maturity are the true keys to mastering the martial arts. As Dre prepares to face down his intimidating tormentor, he begins to realize that the real fight is just beginning.The movie was an entertaining one.It was based on the 1984 version but it updates itself to for modern audiences to enjoy. The movie was unoriginal and took the same plot from the original film BUT it was more engaging and it puts the viewer to have more sympathy to the main characters like Dre and Mr. Han.Aside from that,it was more of an action film as it touches themes on developing the attitude of serenity and maturity.Overall,the remake is better that the original.",The Karate Kid

12,Calicodreamin,Missing the heart,6,18 October 2021,"The Karate Kid remake is missing all the good things that made the original so timeless, there is no chemistry and no heart. The plot is pretty hard to mess up, so at least they left that alone. The action coordination is good and a few beautifully shot scenes. Too darn long though.",The Karate Kid
13,george.schmidt,Excellent remake to the '80s classic sweeps the audience's leg and wins them over with great élan.,9,22 June 2010,"THE KARATE KID (2010) ***1/2 Jaden Smith, Jackie Chan, Taraji P. Henson, Wenwen Han, Rongguang Yu, Zhenewei Wang. Excellent remake to the '80s classic about a young boy (Smith in his first lead performance) finds solace and ultimately redemption in martial arts (this time in China and kung-fu) with help from an unlikely source: his apartment complex's seemingly broken down maintenance man (Chan in arguably his best work to date) who mentors him after he has been menaced by his roughneck classmates. Instilled with purpose, tenacity and heart by Christopher Murphey's stoic screenplay and sharp direction by Harald Zwart sweeps the audience's leg and wins them over with great élan. Smith's folks, Will & Jada Pinkett executive produced this winning crowd-pleaser.",The Karate Kid
14,neil-476,Chan and Smith shine,8,29 July 2010,"Remakes are strange critters. If the film was good, what's the point of remaking it? If you remake it slavishly, what was the point of remaking it? If you change it massively, what was the point of remaking it? The most successful remakes, it seems to me, are those which take the essence of the original but then put their own spin on it, and bring something new to the table. Thus the shot for shot remake of Pysycho was utterly pointless, whereas The Italian Job did well in taking much of the paraphernalia of the original, and using it to tell a completely different story.Which makes The Karate Kid something of an oddity. In story terms, it follows the path of the original pretty closely - a lad is uprooted and relocated against his will: he falls foul of bullies who are trained by an unethical martial arts teacher: he, in turn, is mentored by a lowly handyman who has secrets of his own; and he is then put to an honourable trial by fire at a martial arts tournament. It's fair to comment that even the tournament follows very similar beats to the original. The only major changes are the transplantation of the story to Beijing from Los Angeles, the martial art being changed from karate to kung-fu and, oh yes, the fact that the victim of bullying is a 12-year old (and a young 12, at that) rather than Ralph Macchio's rather mature teen, and his tutor is Jackie Chan rather than Pat Morita faking it.These are rather big changes, actually. Don't get me wrong, I loved Pat Morita's Mr Miyagi - a wonderful performance, full of humanity, gentle humour, and pathos - but Chan gets to show some genuine acting chops here: his melancholic Mr Han has his own backstory which explains the presence of the car in Han's living room. Chan's brand of knockabout humour, brilliant in the right place, is out of tune here and, creditably, doesn't put in more than a token appearance.The Beijing locations add quite a different flavour, but the main attraction is Jaden Smith as Dre. They boy is small, which adds a strong element of vulnerability and, therefore, believability, to his role as a victim - far more so than Ralph Macchio's Daniel-san. What's more to the point, not only does he bring a fierce physicality to the training and fighting sequences, he can act. While there is perhaps an excessive reliance on ""I'm doing my best to hold back tears,"" there are plenty of other opportunities for him to show that he can do it. And he can. It is entirely to his credit that this movie, co-produced by his parents, is not simply a vanity project for their son: the lad is very good and, in himself, is a reason for seeing the movie.It is also worth observing that this movie makes much more, albeit in an understated way, of the father/son relationship between mentor/boy, and the movie is the richer for it.",The Karate Kid
15,anaconda-40658,Remake Kicks No Ass.,5,25 June 2015,"The Karate Kid (2010): Dir: Harold Zwart / Cast: Jaden Smith, Jackie Chan, Taraji P. Henson, Wenwen Han, Zhenwei Wang: Unnecessary remake mistitled when one stops to consider that the student is actually being taught Kung Fu, not karate. Jaden Smith reluctantly accompanies his mother to China when she receives a job transfer. He meets a female violinist around his age, which leads to an encounter with several bullies. After getting his ass kicked a couple times he is rescued by the maintenance guy who will teach him real Kung Fu in time for a tournament. With overwhelming shots of China director Harold Zwart brings out the culture references. Zwart previously made such forgettable films as One Night at McCool's and The Pink Panther 2. Smith is likable going from fish out of water to learning the art of defense. Likewise Jackie Chan delivers one of his deepest performances as his trainer who disagrees with the level of violence taught in Kung Fu classes. Smith and Chan share a unique chemistry that saves the film from certain dread yet we pretty much know the outcome long before it arrives. Taraji P. Henson as Smith's mother is underused and seems only to exist to scold him when his jacket is on the floor. Wenwen Han as the violinist is also cardboard and never really rises above the giddy delight stage of her first encounter. Zhenwei Wang plays the main antagonist who will get his ass kicked by third act. While the original Karate Kid was no breakthrough film, this remake makes little improvement and serves as nothing more than another swift kick to the intelligence. Score: 5 / 10",The Karate Kid
16,FlashCallahan,Interesting pole..,7,20 November 2010,"Dre Parker could've been the most popular kid in Detroit, but his mother's latest career move has landed him in China. Even worse, Dre makes an enemy of the class bully, Cheng. In the land of kung fu, Dre knows only a little karate, and Cheng puts Dre on the floor with ease. With no friends in a strange land, Dre has nowhere to turn but maintenance man Mr. Han, who is secretly a master of karate.Now this was a film I really wanted to hate. I don't know Jaden Smith, but I had this awful feeling that he would just be a younger version of his annoying (but nice) father.The original film has been redone so many times, with it's inferior sequels and even movies like bloodsport, kickboxer, 3 ninjas, American ninja and any other revenge flick of the late eighties/early nineties.Any film that featured someone getting attacked/wanting revenge and then being trained in a sport, was influenced by Daniel San and Mr. Miyagi. So my outlook was very bleak.But to my surprise, Jaden Smith is endearing and Chan outs in his best performance i have ever seen as Mr. Han. Even though the film is quite long, it really needs the length in order for the relationship between the two leads to really build, as this is the heart and soul of the movie.They become close very quickly and have oodles of chemistry, and this doesn't even spoil the predictable outcome.Dre does get a little annoying at times, but than he gets beat up a bit so you really can't stay annoyed at him for long, and this gives you empathy for Dre, a stranger in a strange place, just trying to get on with life.There are some nods to the original, such as the chopstick/fly scene, which made me smile.All in all it's just a feel good film, that is colourful, fun and predictable, but a whole lot of fun.",The Karate Kid
17,DICK STEEL,A Nutshell Review: The Karate Kid,7,12 June 2010,"One can suppose the tremendous love Jaden Smith gets from his parents Will and Jada Pinkett, who probably decided that it makes good sense for their son to learn some form of self-defense, so why not learn from one of the best available, and make a film out of it? I'm wildly speculating here on how this remake of the 1984 film of the same name came about, one which made the fictional Crane Technique famous, and launching Ralph Macchio and Pat Morita to instant fame, especially so for the latter.Serving as producers, the Smith's version of The Karate Kid had Karate as a misnomer, since it's Kung Fu that got featured, although they did place the emphasis on Kid, with their son Jaden being the star of the show, very much younger than how Ralph Macchio turned out to be in his role as Daniel Larusso in the original. And the truth is that Jaden's ability here in the lead role coming off films like The Pursuit of Happiness and The Day the Earth Stood Still, is one of the highlights in ensuring you get sucked into his world of the new out of towner American boy from Detroit now finding himself in a new environment in Beijing, and rubbing off the playground bullies on the wrong foot.Which provides the path to Karate Kid formula, where boy gets a good wallop from his peers, eventually saved by the maintenance man who knows a thing or two about martial arts, becoming a disciple and learning new skills, then entering a contest so that a fair fight can be featured at the finale. And what makes martial arts training more fun, is the East meets West clash of cultures that provide some avenue for light hearted moments, yet balanced with some serious drama when dealing with themes like a disgraced past, or explaining the hocus pocus mysticism behind the martial arts, which took on a somewhat greater proportion here.Some moments of the formula did get an update to suit the different time and premise, especially with the Miyagi aspects paying homage to what Pat Morita had done, with things like the chopsticks and the fly, with a different outcome of course. Even the Crane Technique got a little makeover as well, though this version ran on for a little bit longer, and its finale fight really put you on the edge of your seat with excellent action choreography, though it must be said it's really fictional and at times unbelievable, since the fights were really bone crunching and hard hitting, but nary a scratch or severe injury gets inflicted barring what's necessary as formula. Since the combatants here are sparring sans protective gear, parents may want to warn their kids, who turn up in droves for the film, that there's a degree of artistic license taken here in the bouts, and no you can't kick a guy across the floor without breaking some ribs for instance.What I found more interesting here, is the role that Jackie Chan plays as Mr Han. While no Mr Miyagi spouting words of profound wisdom, you can tell that as Mr Han, Jackie Chan tries hard to not goof around much, and becomes pretty serious in his role. It's somewhat a full circle for JC, after all, he burst into the scene playing exactly the role of ""the Kid"", being trained in a rote like manner similar to waxing on and off, or jacket on and off. In films like Snake in the Eagle's Shadow or Drunken Master, he's on the opposite side of the equation with Yuen Siu Tien playing his master, and with this film, takes on the master's role and training Jaden's Dre Parker in similar fashion. If I can ask JC a question, it'll definitely be to find out how he felt like having to mature into a stage where he's no longer the vengeful student, but the wise, sage like master.Clocking almost 2.5 hours, the film got bogged down by the innocent romance between Dre and Meiying (Han Wenwen) that took up significant screen time to try and provide a little more dimension to Dre, as well as to explore themes like never giving up, and friendship. The other kid in the film, Wang Zhenwei who plays Dre's nemesis Cheng, has enough of that mean streak look to stay as that one-dimensional boogeyman that Dre has to overcome, influenced by the evil Master Li (Yu Rongguang) whose mantra is to be merciless, and never to bat an eyelid when called upon to violate the spirit of fair play.Like the original film, the magic of the appeal lies very much in the pairing and chemistry shared between teacher and student. Here, Jackie Chan turns on his acting chops more so than to run around showcasing his acrobatic ability, leaving the slick moves to a buffed and trained Jaden Smith, who demonstrated that he's more than just a cute boy with braided hair, and possessed tremendous charisma that you can't help but to root for the little fella, who's blessed with nifty dance footwork, movie star looks from his parents and now, enough skills to inflict serious injury. A subtle tone on the surrogate father and son relationship gets hinted at, with director Harald Zwart not wanting to explore this a little deeper, going instead for a number of tourist-like shots of Beijing in a not-too-subtle effort to showcase the city.The Karate Kid spawned a few sequels, one even featuring Hilary Swank before she kicked more butt in Million Dollar Baby. I'm betting on this film being the forerunner to this week's box office results, but a sequel may seem out of the question, since we know just how fast kids at Jaden Smith's age will develop and mature.",The Karate Kid
18,namashi_1,Entertainment....,6,12 June 2010,"'The Karate Kid' is entertainment. A remake of the 1984 martial arts film of the same name, comes a film that provides some kick-ass stuff in a running time over 130-minutes. Harald Zwart's direction is perfect, he makes a good remake, though one expected it to be a poor cousin.'The Karate Kid' has smart-ass Jaden Smith at his best. A complete star, doing stuff that sometimes even elders falter in. Plus, one gets to see the legendary Jackie Chan in a first-ever serious role. And boy, Chan excels from start to end. The Actor in the legend has finally been awaken. He is the soul of the film! Taraji P. Henson also puts up a superb act as Jaden's loving mommy.The stunts are spectacular. The climax, which is almost 30 minutes long, is the highpoint of the film. It's fantastic and jaw-droopingly picturized.'The Karate Kid' is entertainment... which definitely deserves a watch. Also, it gives birth to 2 new talents, Jaden Smith and the Actor Jackie Chan.",The Karate Kid
19,Smells_Like_Cheese,"Well, wax on, wax off, jacket on, jacket off... who knew that teaches kung fu?",7,8 July 2010,"I have to really admit that I underestimated this movie, I went in expecting to hate it. I had been hearing mixed reviews on this movie and to be honest I wasn't interested in it. I loved the original Karate Kid and was a bit ticked off that once again there was another remake. But I do love Jackie Chan and decided to try to go in with an open mind and ended up really liking this movie. Though I wished they did not claim it as a ""remake"", because this would have been great as a sequel. It's definitely a lot better than the other sequels that followed The Karate Kid. I didn't think that Jayden Smith would do that great of a job as his first lead role, but it turns out that he held his own in this movie. He is definitely his father's son, you saw a lot of Will Smith's mannerism's in Jayden. He's got a lot of charm to him and has a great amount of potential to be a very good actor one day. Jackie Chan as usual does a great job and always is a pleasure to watch as he does some incredible stunts that make you wonder how he did it. This was a good movie and was a great addition to the Karate Kid story.12-year-old Dre Parker and his mom arrive in Beijing from Detroit to start a new life. Dre develops a crush on a girl, Mei Ying, but Cheng her semi-boyfriend, attempts to keep them apart by beating Dre, and later harassing and humiliating him in and around school. During a particularly brutal beating by Cheng and his friends, the enigmatic maintenance man of Dre's building, Mr. Han, comes to Dre's aid, revealing himself as a kung fu master who adeptly dispatches Dre's tormentors. After Han mends Dre's injuries, they go to Cheng's teacher, Master Li, to attempt to make peace, but Li challenges Dre to a fight with Cheng. Han accepts, but insists the fight take place at an upcoming tournament, and that Li's students leave Dre alone until the tournament. Han begins training Dre, after several sessions, Dre is now able to display instinctively when prompted by Han's mock attacks. At the tournament, Dre is slow to achieve parity with his opponents, but soon begins to best them, and advances to the semifinals, as does Cheng, who finishes in the semi-finals with Dre and now they face each other once and for all to see who is the master of real kung fu.Now there are a couple of flaws with the film, it did bother me how Dre learned this advanced Kung Fu in just a month give or take. The bullies he faces are just brutal, I'm not talking like a little mean, these kids are just vicious with him and would give Mortal Kombat a run for it's money. So obviously when you see them in class, you assume they've been studying their whole lives and all of a sudden one teacher comes along and Dre magically knows all about Kung Fu in such a short time. In the original it was a little more believable because the kids learn from an American teacher who didn't understand the art of Karate and also in a strip mall, not that it makes a diff, but again that was a little more believable. Also, we learn in the middle of the story that Mr. Han's family was killed in a car accident, as sad as the scene was, it wasn't a needed part of the story. But the movie is beautifully shot showing some of the most gorgeous parts of China that look incredible. The fight scenes are done very well and even the acting was good. I enjoyed this movie and I'm glad that I gave it a chance. Like I said before, I think this should have just been a sequel instead of a remake, but it still worked very well. I do recommend it, Jackie Chan is always worth the watch for a karate, well actually a kung fu movie.7/10",The Karate Kid
20,disdressed12,solid remake,7,1 March 2011,"i enjoyed this remake of the 1984 original.it's a bit more fleshed out than the original,although it may be a bit too long.this one's actually about Kungfu,not Karate,and it shows the definite differences between the two disciplines.Jackie Chan plays the handy man role made famous by Pat Morita in the original.Jaden Smith(Son of Will and Jada Pinket Smith)plays the role made famous by Ralph Machio.i'd say this movie compares favourably to the original in all aspects except one:it doesn't quite have the same crowd pleasing intensity.at least i didn't feel it.still,it's well acted and well directed and looks good.for me,The Karate Kid is a 7/10",The Karate Kid
21,OllieSuave-007,It was a nice stand-alone movie.,7,16 March 2014,"After doing scores of action comedies in the U.S., going over aboard with his martial arts moves at times, it was nice to see Jackie Chan (Jaden Smith) do something a little more dramatic, calm and serious. Here, he plays Mr. Han, who teaches 12-year-old Detroit kid Dre Parker Kung-Fu to counter the bullying from class bully, Cheng (Zhenwei Wang) and his gang. As Han teaches Dre that Kung-Fu is not all about punches and kicks, but maturity and calmness, and Dre realizes that facing down the bullies will be the fight of his life.Chan shows that even being a serious actor he still was able to retain his identity of being a martial arts star, and I think him teaching Dre Kung-Fu the mystery and elements of Kung-Fu to Han's sad secret background provides a great dramatic backdrop for the entire film. The ensuing action and drama did provide steam to the otherwise steady pace of the plot. But, I think the subplot of Dre and Meiying (Wenwen Han) was a little boring and out-of-touch for a action drama movie.Many people make too much comparisons between this and the original Karate Kid with Pat Morita and Ralph Macchio, but I actually enjoy both films and I thought both Morita and Chan each gave their own unique and epic take to the character. But, I also prefer Macchio's character over Smith's as I think that Smith was miscast and has an entitled and egotistic personality both personally and professionally. But, overall, it's a decent film.Grade B",The Karate Kid
22,cherold,Far superior to the original,7,22 February 2011,"The original Karate Kid was a lousy movie with one brilliant scene, the culmination of the ""wax on wax off"" gag. The similar moment in this remake is less effective, lacking the revelatory nature of the first film, but since that is the only thing I liked in the first movie, and I liked a great deal in the sequel, I can forgive it for falling just slightly short in this one area.Like the original, this is all Hollywood Hokum, but the script is much better and the Chinese setting much more interesting. Jackie Chan is, as always, charming, and the kid is quite likable. The movie as often funny and sometimes touching, and if it was completely predictable, well, it's the kind of movie that's supposed to be.This is also notable as something very rare, a mainstream Hollywood hokum movie with no significant white characters. Even when Hollywood makes movies about civil rights struggles or Asian feuds they stick in a few main white characters. Having grown up in the 60s, when every appearance by a black actor was hailed as an historic event, it is remarkable to now live in a time where you don't need a white protagonist for a Disneyish feel-good flick.",The Karate Kid
23,Robert_duder,Silly...was this supposed to be a slapstick comedy??,6,17 August 2010,"First of all I grew up with the original Karate Kid trilogy...absolute 80's classic. The reviews from IMDb'ers, professional reviewers and even my friends that compare this to the original and even talk about how they paid 'homage' to the original is ALMOST as funny as this entire movie and that's really funny!! There is such little in common besides the very loose plot similarities. This would have been much better in my opinion had they kept the original title idea of ""The Kung Fu Kid"" and called it loosely inspired by The Karate Kid. There is little to no Karate and the ""Kung Fu"" in the film is so silly and outrageous its incomprehensible that this little kid who trains for what feels like an hour can spin, and flip, and jump to inhuman heights. Also to top it off when Ralph Macchio portrayed 'teenage' Daniel Larusso in The original classic he was 24 and far more believable in his talent than a 12 year old who is actually 12 and just looks very young. That means his nemesis are also twelve making the scene where Jackie Chan is attacked by a group of little boys and thus beats them all up absolutely ridiculously laughable. I think I would watch this film again just to watch him beat up little kids.The aforementioned Jackie Chan is actually one of the better features of the film. He actually gives a solid and serious performance as the wise Kung Fu teacher. He doesn't even touch Pat Morita's pop culture icon Mr. Miyagi but considering the laughable moments in the film he actually manages a good role. Jaden Smith really tries to break out on his own in this picture. He does an okay job, his acting isn't the issue. He's given some rather silly script and plot to deal with but you can definitely see his chemistry and you can see his Dad's talent in him for big screen blockbusters but I just don't know if this will ever do it for him despite the money it made. Him and Chan just don't have the chemistry required. If so many people are going to try to compare this film to 'the original' then they don't even have a fraction of the chemistry they need. If there is a stand out performance in the film it would be that of newcomer Wenwen Han who plays the young adorable romantic interest for Smith. She is sweet, and cute and just has really good chemistry with Smith. I hope she returns for the sequel and he doesn't change up love interests like the old Karate Kid films. Taraji P. Henson plays Smith's Mom and unfortunately she is overly used. Her character is played like a stereotypical black lady from the streets and its annoying more than anything. Also a newcomer Zhenwei Wang unfortunately is too young for the performance. He looks like a tweener throwing a temper tantrum who happens to be able to throw spin kicks and other ridiculous things.Director Harald Zwart comes from commercials and music videos and seems to have trouble telling a story that isn't 2-5 minutes long. He ruined what was a classic remake in The Pink Panther 2 by turning it into crude and stupid humor instead of fun stupid humor. Now we see him take what is meant to be an inspiring and underdog type story into a silly, slapstick, joke for little kids instead of teens and adults like it was meant to be. Do I sound bitter? Well they shouldn't compare this to a stone cold 80's classic that made me take Karate numerous times and had me watching all three a hundred times. This is definitely for a new generation and a much younger crowd. For me it was a definite just okay and reminiscent of nothing when it comes to the original. I will see the sequel in hopes that a couple years makes this a more realistic and less humorous film. 6/10",The Karate Kid

It's not necessarily a straight 'remake', more a 'reimagining' - or 'adaptation', I guess - and is better for it, focusing on a younger child who's shipped halfway across the world instead of just halfway across the country and making much more of its flashy martial-arts aspects (which aren't actually karate). It probably would have played better if it were called 'The Kung Fu Kid' or something, more an homage than an official follow-up. It isn't bad but it isn't great, either, even though it includes cinematic legend Jackie Chan; here, despite his general brilliance and the decision to not have his character step on a child's crotch, he's sadly no match for the late Pat Morita. 6/10",The Karate Kid

33,FiendishDramaturgy,Fun and Enjoyable,7,27 June 2010,"Jaden Smith has true talent. It's in his genes; there's no denying it. Regardless of how you feel about a Karate Kid remake, between Jaden Smith and Jackie Chan, the movie is fun and enjoyable.Honestly, it failed to do anything the original didn't, except to showcase Jaden's skills at whining, loathing, and being an average 9 or 10 year old boy (at the time of filming). But don't take that to mean his performance isn't enjoyable because it is, unless you're on adolescent-boy-overload, in which case you probably aren't interested in seeing this movie in the first place.My whole crew went to see this one, and the overall opinion was favorable. The story is updated well enough to present a passable scenario whereby the main elements are introduced and used. All that having been said, I would have liked a bit more martial arts in this flick, as what was exhibited was precious little, and pretty lame.I found it a bit implausible that Jaden's character could even come close to doing what it did in the end, because we never saw him do anything even remotely close to that, throughout the movie. And changing the venue from that of Japanese Karate to Chinese Kung Fu...okay, I had no problem with that, but why insist on the title of Karate Kid? This should have had a different name. Kung Fu Kid? Right, that sounds like a lame spoof of Karate Kid and Kung Fu Panda, so call it Karate Kid: the Remake, and don't use karate? It made the whole movie seem off, to me. Fun and enjoyable, but off.All in all? Because of the lack of progression, I wasn't as impressed as I wanted to be, but that was in no way the fault of Jaden Smith or Jackie Chan, whose performances were stellar. This one may not be destined for Friday/Saturday night viewing, but fun and enjoyable, nonetheless.

34,Turfseer,Chan shines as Kung Fu mentor but antagonists never rise above level of comic book villains,5,2 July 2014,"'The Karate Kid' is about a Kung Fu competition so why the misnomer? Apparently American producers reasoned that they could sell more tickets to the older crowd who enjoyed the 1984 production of the same name. This new 'Karate Kid' was a joint Chinese-American production and it was actually titled 'Kung Fu Dream' when released in China.The main conceit of the new version is similar to the old. A boy is mentored by an older man who is an expert in the martial arts, so that he can fend off a coterie of bullies. Here, Jaden Smith is 12 year old Dre, who's forced to leave his old neighborhood in Detroit after his mother is transferred to company headquarters in China.The best part of the film involves Jackie Chan as Mr. Han, a maintenance man in Dre's apartment complex, who teaches Dre that Kung Fu is more than just learning physical moves. Dre must first get over his arrogance, believing that he just about knows everything. Han focuses on Dre's bad habit of always leaving his jacket on the ground, so he has him continuously put the jacket on, throw it to the ground and then hang it up. Later, we learn that this tedious exercise is actually one of Han's techniques to sharpen Dre's coordination. Han also takes Dre up to the Wudang Mountains where a woman reflecting a cobra's movements and a drink from a magical well enhances Dre's appreciation of what Kung Fu is all about.Despite the presence of the earnest Mr. Han, this Karate Kid reboot still leaves a bad taste in one's mouth for a number of reasons. Firstly, there was no effort on the part of the film's scenarists to develop any of the antagonist's characters. The bullies who harass Dre along with the psychopathic Kung Fu master (who promulgates a 'no mercy' philosophy) have no idiosyncrasies to distinguish them from any other typical bad guy we've seen on the silver screen for ages.I also thought it was distasteful depicting pre-pubescent boys as being so violent. If the boys were older teenagers, then perhaps something more realistic could have been developed on the subject of gang psychology. But when we're talking about 12 year olds, I had a hard time believing that Chinese authorities would allow a school like that to operate. Especially after it becomes apparent during a major sanctioned tournament, that juveniles are using Kung Fu techniques to break their opponents' legs at the behest of a mentor who appears to enjoy encouraging criminal conduct.As for verisimilitude of the tournament itself, Dre was injured twice, in his match with two separate opponents. He was given two minutes to return to the ring, but it sure seemed as if Han needed more time than that to use his 'fire cupping' to heal Dre (it looked like the Dre's leg was seriously injured but he miraculously recovers). And with a second blow to the leg, it seems absurd that Dre would be able to continue—but of course, since he MUST win, he does!There's also sub-plot here involving some puppy love between Meiying, a talented violin student and Dre, who gets into trouble with the girl's parents when he encourages her to cut school. Dre has no idea that Meiying's audition has been moved up a day and still seems to be blamed for something he couldn't have known. He also claps after Meiying performs and appears to run afoul of the audition etiquette. Han helps him write a letter of apology and it's ultimately accepted by the girl's parents.It's hard to appreciate Jaden Smith's performance since his character is depicted as being so arrogant before he 'sees the light.' Why not tone down the narcissism a bit so that Dre is a tad bit more tolerable? Finally there is some redemption when Dre is able to dispense with all the self-centeredness and bond with Han, who reveals that he lost his wife and child in a car accident years before.The new Karate Kid holds one's interest despite the simplicity of its narrative. The comic book villains prevent the film from reaching a higher aesthetic level. I understand that there's a new Karate Kid in the offing with Chan and Smith ready to reprise their roles. It should be more interesting since Jaden Smith is no longer 12 years old and might bring something more to the part, given his now advanced age.",The Karate Kid
35,thinker1691,""" The Spirit of Kung Fu begins in the heart and flows through the hand """,8,28 March 2011,"This film is an adaption of the original story called The karate Kid, but is a good remake also called "" The Karate Kid "" despite the fact that it touts the martial art of Kung Fu.

There he goes to a new school and sure enough finds a girl and also confronts a school bully. Seeking a way to balance his soul and his life, he is thereafter taught by a Kung Fu master name Mr. Han (Jackie Chan) who tries to instruct the boy in a way to defend himself, but not to use it as a weapon. The movie is well developed as is the story line. Through the story, we see that the student must slowly adapt to both the rigorous discipline as well as his instructor's painful personal memories.

37,freemantle_uk,A surprisingly decent film,7,11 July 2010,"The Karate Kid remake had everything going against it: it is based on a cult classic, produced by Will and Jada Pinkett Smith so their son can star in a blockbuster, moved the action to China to rely on it's potential box-office and directed by a man who has a less then impressive record. But it turned out to a pretty decent film.12-year-old Dre Parker (Jaden Smith) and his mother (Taraji P. Henson) move from Detroit to Beijing. Dre is forced to go to a new school and make new friends in strange country. He quickly falls a young violin protégé Mei Ying (Wen Wen Han) but runs into group of vicious bullies led by Cheng (Zhenwei Wang). With the bullies being constantly being a threat and he being unable to adjust to his new environment Dre's life becomes a living hell. But when the maintenance man Mr. Han (Jackie Chan) protects the boy the two becomes friends and when Dre is enrolled into a kung-fu tournament to take on the bullies. Mr. Han teaches Dre kung fu and despite some early frustrations Dre soon becomes skilled in the martial art. Dre too starts to form a relationship with Mei Ying as the tournament approaches.The Karate Kid is far being a perfect film, but for what it is it a well done film. Whilst there is some comedy the film for the most part is played straight. The martial arts sequences are pretty bone-crushing and for the most part well directed. With anything that involves Chan the director Harald Zwart simply placed cameras in strategic positions and just lets the man do his thing. The bullying scenes were powerfully handled, for a PG rated film Zwart does not hold back with the ways the bullies treat Dre, forcing him to live in fear. Cheng is a kid you would love to hate. But whilst Cheng is seen as the main antagonist the real villain is Master Li (Yu Rongguang) who teaches his students to be violence and dirty, fighting with no honour compared to Mr. Han's noble and spiritual view on kung-fu, which should be used as self-defence and expand your mind. Plus there excellent cinematography by Roger Pratt, showing the wonderful countryside of China (i.e. the Wudang Mountains) and the major landmarks of Beijing and a fitting score by James Horner.Chan shows that he can be a good actor. His performance is natural, being a tough teacher but a good man. When he has to be funny Chan plays it straight, his character does not realise he is funny. It's a excellent technique. Smith is a bit more hit and miss. His attempts to be like his father trying to inject humour through a similar speaking pattern and psychical actions, but he did not do it as well and the film failed on that front. But when Smith is serious, like when he makes his speech about hating living in China he shows really potential. What the young actor should do is do a serious indie drama and avoid the coattails of his family parents. He could end up being like a male Dakota Fanning.There are problems with the film. The biggest is the running time. At 2 hours 20 minutes it is too long for a family film and seeing the plot is pretty simple there was no need for it to be that long. Half-an-hour could have easily been cut, there are too many montages to point where it reminded me of the Team America song. Also one or two of the bullying scenes could have been shorten. There also to much filler, the film needed to be a little more fasted pace: the audience knows the basic set up so why pussy foot around it in the beginning? Also the element that Dre and Mei Ying forming a relationship was in poor taste considering their age. It could have been just as effective to show the two trying to be friends with the bullies and her family trying to prevent it and show something tender like Mei Ying kissing Dre on the cheek. Plus Mei Ying's dancing to the awful Lady Gaga song just plain inappropriate. The odd couple of jokes could also been seen coming from a mile away, like early on in the plane. Also some of the fight scenes at the tournament were a little heavily edited with some poor placing of the camera. As well, sure Dre's mother would have sent him to a Western school? Finally, the film was set in China and the kids learnt kung fu, so why wasn't the film called The Kung Fu Kid?A film that should pleasantly surprise audiences.",The Karate Kid
38,estebangonzalez10,Avoid fighting....by fighting (mixed message here),6,21 August 2010,"""Sometimes the most important fights are the ones you avoid."" The Karate Kid, which should be called The Kung Fu Kid, is based on the famous 80's movie starring Ralph Macchio and Pat Morita although this time the story takes place in China and the plot is a little different. Jaden Smith is the Ralph Macchio of this generation but he is much younger and Jackie Chan has a similar role to the one Pat Morita made famous as Mister Miyagi. I really couldn't imagine these two actors playing these similar characters, but they did a great job and had great chemistry together. Chan was funny and at the same time he showed the wisdom his character needed to have. The famous chopstick and fly scene from the original Karate Kid is also used in this film, but with a nice twist. These sort of nostalgic elements that were introduced in the movie worked very well, and it was hard not to sympathize with Chan or Smith. Harald Zwart did a decent job with the direction of this movie, although at 140 minutes I felt it was too long. The other issue I had with the film is that it tries to preach against non violence, but it does it by using violence, and the main problem is that this time around the kids are even younger, they are twelve year olds. The scene where Chan has to defend himself from these kids who attack him just felt too awkward because you can't help but think how a grown man would fight off these boys. Even though he never actually hits them, it still felt weird. Christopher Murphey did a decent job with the screenplay and brought us a more modern version of The Karate Kid without leaving out important details from the original.Dre Parker (Jaden Smith) is a twelve year old only child living with his mother, Sherry (Taraji P. Henson), ever since his father passed away when he was younger and the film opens with Dre saying goodbye to his friends in Detroit because he is moving to China with his mom. Dre isn't very excited about traveling to this new country and he isn't interested in learning Chinese either. Once they arrive in China Dre meets a sweet girl from the neighborhood named Meiying (Wenwen Han) who happens to be a very talented cello player. But not everyone is as nice to Dre as Meiying is and he gets bullied by a group of kids who happen to know kung fu. The leader of the group is Cheng (Zhenwei Wang) whose sole purpose in the film is to make Dre's life miserable. One day, when Dre is getting beat up by these bullies Mr. Han (Jackie Chan), the maintenance man from the apartment building Dre lives in, shows up and fights off the kids. Mr. Han befriends Dre who wants him to teach him Kung Fu. Mr. Han declines at first because he says Kung Fu is a way of life and not meant for violence and fighting, but after meeting the Kung Fu master (Rongguang Yu) where Cheng gets his training Mr. Han decides to sign Dre for the tournament in order for the kids to stop bullying him in school. Cheng promises to leave Dre alone so he can prepare for the tournament, Mr. Han begins training him and together they learn important lessons.Jackie Chan and Jaden Smith are great together and they are the reason why the movie is above average because otherwise this is just a formulaic predictable film. One of the main differences this movie has with the original is that it takes place in China, which makes things all the more interesting because the scenery is beautiful. There are some great scenes of the Great Wall, of some temples in the mountaintops, and of the impressive National Stadium (the Bird's Nest) constructed for the Olympics that just took place in Beijing. Zwart does a great job introducing us to the major touristic attractions in Beijing. The climax of the movie is also great with a very entertaining championship that takes place (which tops the original one). Fans of the original will be pleased as well as younger audiences who weren't familiar with it. The main problem I had with this film is the age difference between the stars of the film. In the original Ralph was in his twenties, while in this movie Smith is a twelve year old so some of the fighting and training scenes seemed a little extreme for someone so young. I can't help but remember a scene where Dre tells an old man who is beating him at ping pong ""C'mon, man. I'm twelve."" That is what I kept on thinking when I saw this kid train so hard and fighting. The movie is still worth it because of the scenery and the great performances from Chan and Smith.http://estebueno10.blogspot.com/",The Karate Kid
39,hu675,Nice remake of the 1984 classic.,8,21 August 2010,"12 year old Dre Parker (Jaden Smith) and his mother Sherry (Taraji P.

Which Meiying is a near professional violinist. But Dre finds himself in trouble with an tough bully named Cheng (Zhenwei Wang), an Kung Fu prodigy. Who beats Dre up, whenever he sees him. But Dre finds himself saved by the maintenance man Mr. Han (Jackie Chan), who lives in the building where Dre lives. When Dre finds himself beaten up by six teenagers. Mr. Han is actually an Kung Fu master, he decides to teach Dre for self-defence and more. Mr. Han finds out that Dre's enemy Chang is teaches by Master Li (Yu Rongguang), who teaches his students to show no mercy. Mr. Han teaches Dre the old ways of Kung Fu and Mr. Han have no choice to bring Dre to the tournament, which Master Li wants an challenge.Directed by Harald Zwart (The Pink Panther 2, Agent Cody Banks, One Night at Mc Cool's) made an surprisingly good remake of the 1984 classic by making the kid younger, different culture setting and making the lead character mother's being more in the story. Smith and Chan are terrific in their roles. Especially Chan giving an dramatic performance with his usually charming sense of humour. Smith is actually impressive with his Karate sequences, which it brings to some surprises. Wenwen Han is good as Dre's love interest. Wang is certainly menacing as Dre's enemy.""The Karate Kid"" remake turns out to be one of the biggest box office success of this year, especially with the good reviews by critics has giving this movie. It is certainly one of the best examples, how to do an remake very well and as well to Honor the original. Will Smith, Jade Pinkett Smith and Jerry Weintraub (The producer of the original series) are the producers of the movie. Robert Mark Kamen (The Fifth Element, Taken, Unleashed) still credited for the original story. Christopher Murphey wrote an fine screenplay.

40,aharmas,Improving on a classic?,10,26 June 2010,"Who would have believed that Jackie Chan could give us a deep performance? Jaden Smith would pose himself as one of the best actors of the year? ""The Karate Kid"" could be transferred to China and be actually more fun than the original? Yes, all of those things are possible, and the remake of the original 80's classic is a lot of fun and excitement, with a brand new setting, and some very charismatic and accomplished performances. The new version of the kid has a Detroit transplant facing some serious bullying and becomes a protégée of a mysterious handyman who eventually takes all the way to the local karate championships.As the story unfolds, we are treated to a travelogue of an exotic country, with its own colorful background, a visit to the Forbidden City, some gorgeous locales, and of course, a few scenes on the Great Wall of China. Never letting go of the center stage is Smith, a young man who has been training on martial arts for a while gives us a magnetic performance, with all the shades of his character. He experiences a bit of psychological and physical pain, frustration, anger, joy, love, etc. as his character grows and becomes more adapted to the ways of the Far East.""The Karate Kid"", like ""The Blind Side"" hits every note perfectly, gives us a good time and shows us what a good director can do. There are several electrifying moments, with plenty of suspense, and many an eye will water by the end of the film. A must see.",The Karate Kid
41,pachara87,There's life in this franchise yet.,6,12 April 2019,"The action sequences, as expected with Chan, are amazing. These, along with a snappy pace, stunning locations and credible performances, counterbalance the film's overlong running time.",The Karate Kid
42,eric262003,"Liked The Movie, But The Remake was Unnecessary",7,2 April 2012,"""The Karate Kid"" remake never really should have never been released. The remake has no real valuable qualities that are equivalent to the original 1984 released ""Karate Kid"". It lacked any kind of faithfulness to the original 1984 version, however it does stand alone as an homage to the cult classic movie from the 1980's.Even the legendary Jackie Chan has not reached the same level as his predecessor Pat Morita in his role as the mentor to our leading protagonist because he's been in the situation on both ends of the spectrum as both the teacher and the student from other films before. The choreography exhibited in this modern remake is much more fun to watch than the previous ""Karate Kid"" movies in spite of depending on wire fighting and the cinematography displayed in the newer version painted a clearer picture of all the events that has transpired up to the exciting climax during the final scenes.I omitted a star from the review due to the fact that the movie went on for way too long. When I was in the theater two years ago, a large number of parents exited the theaters to take their kids to the concession stands or the bathrooms before the eagerly anticipated tournament scenes And the scenes during the fights where the dialogue was included went on for too long as we awaited for another tense fight scene and I'm usually a very patient person. But those are the only shortcomings I had about this movie.On a positive note, the shooting was extremely sublime. The scenery was picture perfect and the details were very stimulating. The script scores high points in terms of editing. And dynamics of the performers range from really good to outstanding. Wenwen Han was absolutely adorable as Jaden Smith's love interest. Zhenwei Wang was fun to watch as Dre's (Smith) adversary as he quickly disguises his mannerisms as he successfully plays it coy in front of the school principal. The fight scenes in the courtyard where Mr. Han goes up against Dre's antagonists had a lot of poignancy in that scene equally as exciting as in the final fight scenes, sadly the majority of the other fight scenes is overdone in close-ups and it's distracting because you can't clearly visualize what's transpiring here. Maybe the reason for that is because 1984, actor Ralph Macchio was a much older character than Dre Parker and that the evil bullies were also as young too. And I guess with all the kiddies in the audience, it would be very disturbing to watch a group of kids beating the tar out of each other. The scene at Wang's karate school have kids who might be older is filmed in a more further distance from the camera shots and the barbaric regiments these students face is quite astoundingly brutal. So maybe it was the director Harald Zwart's conscious decision to procure confusing shots.So though the remake was not a needy one since I enjoyed the original movie a great deal, I still thought the remake was also very well crafted. Whether you like or do not like karate, the film is still filled with action, humor and a positive message brought on about overcoming one's odds and reaching your goals and that bullies are just pansies in disguise. I am glad when it came out in theaters and though it's not up to par with the original 1984 release, it was still very fun to watch and I would recommend it to anyone and it's also a family movie the whole gang could enjoy.",The Karate Kid
43,Sandcooler,"Totally redundant, but Chan saves some of it",5,23 September 2015,"I don't really have anything against remakes, but it just comes of as lazy when the plot is redone beat for beat. They just changed the location, the rest is pretty much identical. I'm not going to pretend the original ""Karate Kid"" aged well, but you don't really care about that: it's meant to be dated, most of us watch it for nostalgic value. It's fine when a new version can add something here and there, but by now the old underdog story has been done to death and you get a pretty irritating main character that's really tough to cheer for. Thankfully, the movie does score a homerun in casting Jackie Chan. Chan is a classically trained actor, but unfortunately he doesn't get to show that often. Here he does a great emotional scene that could easily fall flat with a lesser actor, but he sells it and at least gives this movie an actual character. The main kid, his mother and the obligatory love interest are essentially non-entities, milking their one character trait for what it's worth. But whenever Jackie Chan's Mr. Han is on screen, he makes the movie a lot better than it has any business being. Then again: the chemistry between Ralph Macchio and Pat Morita is difficult to find again, and you sorely miss it in this remake.",The Karate Kid

Dre immediately falls for his classmate Mei Ying but cultural differences make such a friendship impossible. Even worse, Dre's feelings make an enemy of the class bully, Cheng. In the land of kung fu, Dre knows only a little karate, and Cheng puts ""the karate kid"" on the floor with ease. With no friends in a strange land, Dre has nowhere to turn but maintenance man Mr. Han, who is secretly a master of kung fu. As Han teaches Dre that kung fu is not about punches and parries, but maturity and calm, Dre realizes that facing down the bullies will be the fight of his life. --© SonyI'm sorry. It's not going to wait. I have to say it now: THE KARATE KID is easily one of the best movies of the year. And I'll be honest, I'm pretty glad to say that because it has been a pretty mediocre year for movies so far, and we're halfway through it! But before I say anything else, I need to come clean and say I haven't seen the original film. OK. Now I got that out of the way, let's begin. I liked the story a lot. Sure, underdog films are predictable, but I personally enjoy them immensely, especially if they're well made, like this film. There's a lot of heart in here.The thing that stuck out most for me in this film is the setting of China. The film really benefits from this because there are rarely any Hollywood films that take place in this beautiful country. It's great to see scenes that are on location from the Forbidden City to the Great Wall. There's no CGI or built sets from California. The scenery is just fascinating. What you see is what you get. And seeing the story takes place in this country, there's an authentic feel that is brought to the film. The gorgeous cinematography just adds more to the ""wow"" factor to audiences who have never been to China.The second thing that impressed me was the diverse cast. It's great to see Asians and African Americans filling the roles of a Hollywood film. You don't see that much these days. And the missing stereotypes is a huge plus in my book! Some of you might be hesitant about Jaden Smith playing the lead role but I gotta tell you, this kid has a lot of acting chops. His performance is vulnerable and you sympathize for his character. Oh, and this is the best performance I've ever seen from Jackie Chan. He gives a really powerful and emotional performance. There was one or two scenes that made me cry because of how raw his acting was. The chemistry between these two actors could not have been better. Taraji P. Henson is good although wasn't as great as Smith and Chan. Lastly, Wenwen Han was pretty good as Smith's love interest.Now, the fight scenes. You wouldn't notice by the trailers but, I have to admit, they were pretty damn brutal and shocking. The fact that most of the fighting is done by kids just adds on to the surprisingly heavy quality of the film. The running time for the film is around 140 minutes, which may seem long and tedious and more than it should be, but due to the great pacing of the film, you would hardly notice it at all. It gives the characters, especially our protagonist, time to develop and grow. The score by Howard Shore is fantastic as well.Overall, THE KARATE KID is THE movie to see this summer. The performances are freaking fantastic and the third act will certainly make you stand up and cheer. It's also a great movie for all ages. Sure, the story is predictable but it's well made and there's a lot of heart to it. If that's not good enough for an underdog film, then what is? I know it's stupid and clichéd but I'll just say it anyway: The film is a winner!",The Karate Kid

46,shakercoola,Respectable remake,5,10 August 2018,"An American adventure film; A story about a boy who moves from Detroit to China experiencing a culture shock, a situation made worse when he falls foul of the class bully. Putting aside the obvious comparisons with the original film, this version was surprisingly good at recreating the spirit of the boy who fights back. Jackie Chan was well cast and excels in the training sequences as guru to the plucky young kid. He shows a sensitivity to his character which worked well here. The star of the show was Jaden Smith as the winsome young boy. He plays his character with verve, emotional balance, humour and great spirit and he shines on screen. The film is not as satisfying as ""The Karate Kid"" (1984) but the fighting sequences are better and more convincing. Credit should also be given to Zhenwei Wang for his gruesome bully and light relief from Taraji P. Henson. The title is confusing though; the martial art conveyed is kung fu not karate.",The Karate Kid
47,MartianOctocretr5,Jackie Chan should have karate-kicked the script writer,4,26 September 2010,"Could have been better. If Jackie Chan had beaten up the writer. And director. And most of the cast; especially that kid.Such an insult to a classic original. It wants to be a ""reimagining."" What it is: ""ridiculous."" It looks like somebody was trying to do a culture clash type story about two cultures they've never seen before. It doesn't really matter, since the whole paper-thin ""bullies don't like his bad hair day"" sub-plot is just an excuse for its half-baked sports competition finale. The cultures are some kid named Dre with dreads (get it?), and some Chinese kids who you never know anything about. Except that their teacher/mob-boss (or whatever he is) wants them to punch, slam, and kick everybody senseless. ""Show no mercy!"" Sounds like the attitude of this film's script writer.Jackie Chan keeps this from being the kind of movie people would walk out of even from an airplane cruising at 38,000 feet. Unfortunately, he's not the center of attention; Jaden Smith as the title character is the focus. Chan's character rescues him, takes him under his wing, and instructs him in the ways of the Karate force. Too bad neither Chan or anybody else can do anything about the kid not inheriting the acting talents of his parents.The actors doing the fight scene stunts were better, but that's about all the movie allows them to do. Whoever wrote this thing felt obliged by martial art movie quota standards to stick them with a few bargain-basement ""philosophy"" lines. Lines that were obviously written by someone who knows nothing about Eastern, or any other philosophy. The reason for the animosity between various characters was poorly rendered. The child playing the girl-friend was among the better actors in the cast, but her interest in him made no sense. Like the whole set-up idea, that a single mom and son would be relocated to a hostile environment, doesn't make any sense.See the original Karate Kid. Or one of Chan's other movies. But not this.",The Karate Kid

49,oneguyrambling,A reasonable - but unnecessary - remake. (30 minutes too long though.),6,17 December 2010,"It is either sleight of hand or mismanagement of film, all I know is that this film would've improved by culling an hour or so of screen time.Lil' Will is Dre, his Mum calls herself Miss Sheri. Miss Sheri can best be described by herself as ""sassy"", at least that is how she appears to see herself.Dre and Miss Sheri are moving to China after the death of Dre's Father. What she does in China is not explained, nor is why she doesn't seem to attempt to learn Chinese.When they arrive at their apartment a blonde kid practically meets him at the car door, gives him a flawlessly executed two step handshake that involves no shake and more or less states to the world ""I'll be you best bud from here on in"" to Dre.Blondie gets one more scene and is never seen again.In classic film style that next scene introduces Dre to the only other main characters we will see in the movie. It happens almost immediately after the meeting at the car, so in about 15 minutes of real time Dre meets everyone he will spend the next couple of months with and yet the movie still takes 2 ½ hours! Dre goes to ask the maintenance man named Mr Han (Jackie Chan) for some help, when that request falls on deaf ears he runs into Blondie again and plays basketball for one shot. Then Dre sees a pretty young Chinese girl sitting on a bench, he chats her up by performing some sort of Chris Brown dance, only he leaves out the punch at the end gentleman. This catches the eye of some other local kids who step up to Dre who has a few words and is then beaten up.So to recap: in two scenes we've met the hero, the sidekick who disappears, the soon-to-be teacher, the love interest and the bully and the f*cking thing STILL takes 2 ½ hours.Of course the next day at school sees the love interest Mei-Ying and the bully Cheng in Dre's class. The next few scenes have them all running into each other every five minutes, at school and after. Dre and Mei-Ying share awkward pre-teen glances and chats and the bully and his two buds always seem to be in the background warning him away.After being saved from another bully-beating by Mr Han Dre demands that Mr Han teach him how to fight.Getting somewhere right? Surely? Well sort of, I'll >> a little by stating that Mr Han takes Dre to enrol in a kung-fu class, only Cheng is the star pupil and the Sensei character is a pr*ck. The upshot of this is that Dre will be taught by Mr Han and that he will fight in a karate tournament soon, how that came to be the net result makes no sense to me.To heighten matters Mei-Ying is ordered by her parents to stop talking with Dre, but in one Cyrano De Bergerac scene Dre sorts that out and all is forgiven.Anyway, training takes about 40 minutes but is really only one 4 minute montage near the end. The first 20 minutes is less ""wax-on wax-off"" than ""Jacket-on, jacket-off"". Dre begins to doubt that his master has skillz, also why he is not comfortable in public and most of all why he has a car in his living room.For another 20 minutes Han takes Dre on a spiritual journey where he drinks ""Magic Kung-fu water"". Cue the final montage and the tournament.My point. The initial set-up of the entire film is shown in maybe the first 15 minutes, then there is another 30+ before Mr Han actually starts training him. Small subplots crop up along the way, but they are generally dealt with quickly. The training lasts about an hour start to finish but is really two scenes of maybe 8 minutes total, the montage does most of the work. This leaves 12 or so minutes for the entire tournament, yet by the time it starts we are almost 2 hours in!This movie would be far more effective with a minimum of 30 minutes cut out - and I bet you wouldn't notice what was taken. Early in the film there are at least three scenes that show traffic on the Chinese freeways backed up for ages, we know China has a lot of people in it - it's the most densely populated country in the world - please don't show us three times.^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^The tournament brings no surprises, there are no incredible new moves or jaw dropping sequences, as real violence doesn't get a PG rating.Jackie proves that he can act and has a great bemused face when told something he disagrees with, Lil' Will is competent but the real test will come when his voice breaks in a couple years, and Miss Sheri is sassy in the background without being asked to do much more than look concerned.It is a fair to ask if we needed this film at all. But in isolation as a star-vehicle for Will's kid (which in essence is what it is) it does the job without the spark of the original.Those too young to have seen the first version may like this, those who are old enough to have seen both will wonder if this was really necessary.Final Rating – 6.5 / 10. A likable movie that takes too long to tell a simple story and doesn't really stretch itself any more than it needs to.",The Karate Kid

I'll cut to the chase, watch it if you have time, but not until you do. The acting is only so good and I have to wonder if it was redone as it was to take advantage of the Chinese market along with the US market.
Most movies you can pick out a pivotal moment, and frankly this one doesn't have one. I've not seen the original KK in probably 20 years, but I can tell you its pivotal moments and I just watched the remake for the 2nd time in probably 5 years.

52,jon.h.ochiai,Everything is Kung Fu,9,19 June 2010,"In ""The Karate Kid"" Mr. Han (Jackie Chan) tells his student Dre (Jaden Smith), ""Everything is kung fu The way you put on a jacket. The way you treat people."" This envisioning of the original ""The Karate Kid"" is inspired. ""The Karate Kid"" is awesome. Director Harald Zwart and screenwriter Christopher Murphey basically follow Robert Mark Kamen's 1984 story reset in China. The distinguishing difference is Jackie Chan as kung fu teacher Mr. Han. Chan is a martial arts master and the real deal. He commands an emotional and authentic gravitas. Jaden Smith (Will Smith's son) possesses his dad's charisma and presence. Smith trained intensely, and looks strong in martial arts action. This ""Karate Kid"" has the same message, and now the exquisite martial arts to match. We see bright students practicing at the legendary Shaolin Temple. In a breathtaking scene an elegant woman demonstrates the snake kung fu style with a cobra on a beautiful mountain temple ledge.""The Karate Kid"" filmed in China for about 60 days. So we also get a spectacular glimpse of China be it the Forbidden City or The Great Wall. I had a new appreciation of this ""Karate Kid"" being now a martial arts teacher. ""Everything is kung fu."" That is the way. ""The Karate Kid"" is about reclaiming one's courage and power. At the story arc Mr. Han tells Dre, ""Always strong!"" I think ""The Karate Kid"" surpasses the original in form and spirit.In ""The Karate Kid"" 12 year-old Dre (Smith) and his mother Sherry Parker (Taraji P. Henson) move from Detroit to China. Sherry does this to continue working for car manufacturer. We find out that Dre's Dad recently died as well. Dre is not happy about the move, having to learn Chinese, and going to a new school. However, he falls for a cute Chinese girl Meiying (pretty Wenwen Han), a violin protégé. Turns out Dre becomes the punching bag for bully Cheng (Zhenwei Wang) who may be protecting Meiying. Dre is all heart and Cheng is a skilled kung fu student. Consequently, Dre gets his ass kicked horribly. Making matters worse Dre also has to contend with Cheng's crew. Dre is hating life.Just as Cheng and his crew are about to pummel Dre to nothing, the apartment maintenance man Mr. Han (Chan) dispatches the pack with incredible martial arts prowess. Mr. Han reluctantly agrees to teach Dre ""real kung fu"". He really sees that Dre is tired of being afraid—of others and himself. At the story arc Dre confesses to Mr. Han, "" I just don't want to be afraid anymore."" I recall that is what first got me into martial arts as a kid. ""The Karate Kid"" resonates on that very human level. We all have to reclaim our honor and strength in our own way. For Dre this starts with taking off his jacket, dropping it, and picking it up. This is a clever homage to ""wax on, wax off"". Everything is kung fu.In the meantime, Han tells Cheng's teacher Master Li (arrogant Rongguang Yu) to leave Dre alone until the big Kung Fu Tournament—to allow him to train. However, at the tournament all bets are off. Master Li teaches his student mercilessness and only physical prowess. Han reminds Dre, ""There are no bad students, only bad teachers."" This is dead on.Much of ""The Karate Kid"" is predictable, even given its homage to the original story. Though particularly with Chan, we are won over by great heart. He and Jaden have a magically chemistry. Chan really displays depth and range in Han, who guards a painful secret. Smith has great spirit whether he is enduring great pain or stumbling with pretty Meiying. Life is in the paradox. Han commands Dre in the tournament, ""Focus. No mind."" Always strong. And it is very touching when Dre hugs Han, and tells him that he loves him. Everything is kung fu—courage, honor, and love. ""The Karate Kid"" honors this with great compassion, humor, and heart. It is about seeing the greatness in others.",The Karate Kid
53,stephenchase-63504,The greatest remake ever!!,10,8 February 2021,"The movie is full of kissing, action, and humor, so LOL!!!!!!!!!",The Karate Kid
54,Ruskington,Makes you appreciate the brilliance of the original,3,16 April 2020,"The original Karate Kid would have to be considered one of the greatest feel-good films ever made and a true eighties classic. Did they need to produce a remake? Absolutely not. Could they have pulled it off with a really strong production team and talented cast? Probably not. Did they pull it off? Definitely not. This is just another money-grabbing regurgitation with zero artistic merit. This movie felt like a personal attack on my childhood (the Back to The Future inspired skateboard scene was particularly offensive).The plot is so similar to the original that almost every scene, character and piece of dialogue has a direct reference point against which it falls well short. It is also unnecessarily long with many scenes padded out for no good reason.Jaden Smith as Dre Parker is irritatingly precocious and not a hero you really want to root for. To be fair, Ralph Macchio's Daniel was also pretty obnoxious so it's hard to say if the character was written this way deliberately or if Smith is just an annoying over-indulged brat. Given who his dad is, I lean towards the latter.Jackie Chan does a decent job as the mentor but he has an almost impossible task trying to recreate the magic of Miyagi. I really feel like they wasted Chan's potential by not giving Han a more distinct personality and story arc. I was very impressed with Zhenwei Wang though, who gives a nice understated performance as the menacing villain Cheng.My favourite moment in the original movie is where Daniel's waxing and painting labours finally come to fruition with that amazing scene in Miyagi's backyard. The 'pick up the coat' routine is pathetically weak by comparison and doesn't even make any logistical sense. They honestly shouldn't have even tried to recreate such a classic moment. Also, Daniel's 'Crane kick' is so much more satisfying and believable than Dre's stupid 'tame the cobra' nonsense.One thing I did like was the show of respect that the Fighting Dragon crew showed to Han right at the end- probably the only real original and poignant moment in the film.This movie is reasonably watchable- despite it's ridiculous runtime- but that is purely because it is mimicking a brilliant well-loved storyline, not because the cast, writers or producers added anything to it. Hollywood really needs to stop churning out these hideous remakes and the Smith family should really just find something else to do with their time.",The Karate Kid
55,joebloggscity,Kung Fu kid doesn't match up to its more humble predecessor,3,20 September 2019,"For a certain generation like mines, there's just no way you can get around comparison to the original which is an undoubted classic of that era. Many would like to criticise the need for a remake, but it's par the course for films nowadays across many genres, so there's no point restarting that arguement.I won't rehash the premise of the film as it's so well known, but one things for certain: if you really want to understand what was so special about the original then maybe watching this remake will clearly show you why! Despite having the greater budget, the legendary Jackie Chan and a ready set fan base, this film fails to capture at all what was so great about the original.With all due respect to Jackie Chan, who is an adept actor, he is possily too well known to have been able to capture the mystery of a Mr Miyagi (Pat Morita in the original didn't even know any martial arts). He does a fair job, but what made Mr Miyagi so humbling just doesn't come across here.Granted the dialogue & script didn't help in the film for anyone, but there was also little chemistry between the key leads. The girl/boy and teacher/pupil relationship just didn't engross as in the original. Part of the problem was also that these were kids as against olders teenagers on the verge of adulthood in the original . That all played a part in the success of the script of the original.No denying the martial arts in this film is on a different far higher level than the original, but again that's an issue. The original was a counterweight to the high flying 100mph martial arts movies of the time. The Karate Kid was about simplicity and down to earth action, not impressing with roundhouses & flying kicks. This film's directors failed to understand that.It's a shame to have to be negative on this film, but even standalone I wasn't convinced. I struggled to empathise enough with any of the characters in this film to truly care.Disappointing, and I maybe was just hoping that as much as it was too much to ask it to match the original, then at least in its own way it could have at least tried to pay due honour to it. I'm not convinced at all that it even successfully did that.",The Karate Kid
56,ajs-10,"Not great, but not awful either...",7,19 June 2011,"A long long time ago I saw a film called 'The Karate Kid', all about a young man who is trained by a master in martial arts so he can stop living in fear of the bullies around him. During his training he learns, amongst other things, respect. This is a remake of that film and despite a lot of dollars being thrown at it and moving the action to China, it's not as good as the original by some way. Don't get me wrong, it's not all bad, there is at least one good performance in there, there is some nice cinematography and the final scenes are quite exciting. Unfortunately though, I have seen it all before.When single mother, Sherry Parker is transferred to China for her job, she takes her son, Dre with her. Now Dre finds it hard to fit in in a new country, but does his best. Unfortunately a group of bullies start to pick on him and these guys are very good at Kung Fu. Eventually Dre decides he must learn Kung Fu in order to beat them and to this end he persuades the maintenance man for their building, Mr. Han, to help him. It is agreed with the bullies' Kung Fu master that he will be left alone to train for an upcoming tournament. Mr. Han starts training and Dre doesn't feel it is going well until he is shown just what Kung Fu is all about. The training then progresses at a pace and the day of the tournament arrives. Has Dre learned enough to beat the bullies? Well you can probably guess I'm not going to tell you here.As I hinted at the beginning the film is beautifully shot with all of the famous Chinese sights on full display, everything from the Great Wall to the Forbidden City. Performance wise, well I always find Jaden Smith, who plays Dre, a little too precocious and, in this case, a little too small for the role. On the other hand I thought Jackie Chan was excellent as Mr. Han. He handled the role really well even the dramatic parts. Also worthy of note were Taraji P. Henson as Sherry Parker, Wenwen Han as Meiying, Rongguang Yu as Master Li and Zhenwei Wang as Cheng.I can't say I disliked this version, let's say I didn't dislike it quite as much as I expected to. That isn't to say it's particularly good. For one thing it's way too long and there are quite long periods where not a lot happens. There is a love story thrown in which I found quite laughable and didn't really add anything to the narrative. Over all, not a great film but not a total loss either, if you're going to see it Jackie Chan is the best thing in it (IMO). If you're not inspired to see it then I don't suppose you've really missed all that much.My Score: 6.5/10",The Karate Kid
57,EijnarAmadeus,Little guy with big trouble in big China.,8,26 January 2011,"A remake of such a popular film as the original 'Karate Kid' is risky business, but luckily this 2010 edition actually surpasses the original, and probably the most ingenious thing about it was the casting of Jaden Smith in the leading role. He is a charming, sympathetic, funny and charismatic young guy, and throughout the film he actually shows some good acting chops too. The film is perfect in its approach to the material, as it doesn't take itself too seriously and all of the more mellow scenes are done with a good balance; you'll end up rooting for Dre (Smith) and his mentor (Jackie Chan) as they go head-on against a vicious gang of kung-fu apprentices.",The Karate Kid

I am aware of much of the criticism around this movie, claiming it is awful and not worth seeing. To all those who have said these things, I just have to ask: What movie were you watching? The best way that I can describe the overall tone is a cross between an episode of the TV show Kung Fu and one of the Die Hard movies. I smiled and was moved and all of that good stuff. At the end of the day, it's a fun, entertaining film. I was surprised as well by how well done it was. The quality was excellent. The screenplay is intelligent, focused and clever.",The Karate Kid
59,deatman9,Can you call this a remake?,5,9 November 2012,As soon as I heard Disney was remaking this movie I know it would fail. First avole this movie is not even a remake its more of like a re-imagining there's nothing in it from the original. The kid in it is like 10 which makes no sense so the original is better by far.This movies about a young 11 year old or so that moves to china with his mother.He starts getting bullied by the Chinese kids so he learns karate from a trainer.I know it sounds like the same story line and it is but its completely different. I wish they would have just stuck with the original or not even remade this at all the original was made in the 80s it doesn't need a remake Jesus. No Mr Myagi in this one either and thats not even tolerable.,The Karate Kid
60,Hayden-86055,Not as good as the original but still fun nonetheless,7,24 December 2020,"Jaden Smith and Jackie Chan star in this remake set in China, Jaden plays Dre, an American boy who's just moved to China because of his Mum's new job, similar to the original in that regard but they don't share too many similarities.Jaden Smith puts up a good performance, I saw a lot of reviewers critiquing Jaden to a ridiculous degree, which I think is awfully unfair. He's only 12 in this and he performs well in my opinion, it's not Oscar worthy but it's fine. Jackie Chan is very impressive as the teacher and of course he does all his own stunts like usual. Action wise I felt it to be overall impressive but certain scenes like the end tournament felt just a bit over the top in parts and almost artificial in a way which was a shame, but even so the tournament was still fun to watch.The side characters are well developed, Cheng being a nasty bully and Mei Ying believable as Dre's new friend. But the relationship between Dre and Mr Han is the best part and works quite well. As well as Dre's relationship with his Mother which plays off very natural.7/10: Good remake with enough new content so as not to disappoint",The Karate Kid
61,Movie-Misfit,Almost Perfect With A Hint Of Hollywood Cheese!,8,2 December 2014,"Like the rest of you, hearing about a remake of an American martial arts classic starring Jackie Chan, sounded ghastly!I mean, as Chan's number one fan, seeing him reduced to a non- fighting old man to give some kid the spotlight because his famous daddy is the producer, was just plain insulting. The biggest action star on the planet was getting a retirement role...And before we knew it, the film was on the big screen.As always, I took it for what it was and went in with my head held high, hoping for something amazing. Something that wasn't going to play down the incredible Jackie Chan anymore than Hollywood already had!Something that wasn't just another remake.And we got it!Sure, the young Mr Smith doesn't learn Karate. He learns Kung Fu! But producer Jerry Weintraub didn't want to call it The Kung Fu Kid... that would be too easy.But I think that's my only gripe. What we get, is a wonderfully crafted, family film with some great fight scenes, values learned, and a masterful performance from Jackie Chan that at times, leaves you with a lump in your throat. Shifting the setting to China, we are given a tour of the most beautiful scenery including a training scene on the Great Wall Of China, that is so typical of Hollywood just so we know where they are!Had it been set in France there no doubt would have been the same scene on the Eiffel Tower.Jaden Smith, as annoying as a young man that he has turned out to be full of cockiness and lack of acting talent such as that in After Earth, actually serves this role quite well.A few years younger, his pint sized cuteness and smile make him instantly likable, with his acting being pretty damn good and natural. I don't know what happened to him, only that fame went to his head quickly after this film...In the training and action scenes, Smith really holds up well and pulls off some wonderful moves against a team of amazing little Chinese Wu Shu artists, led by Hong Kong legend Yu Rong Gwong. Jaden's on- screen relationship with his master Han, played by Jackie Chan is also wonderful. They play off each other so well and have a genuine rapport that is just as good as that of the original.The Karate Kid, the remake, is simply fantastic. With only a few whiffs of typical Hollywood cheese, you can hardly be disappointed!Well worth watching!!On a side note; I just picked up this film brand new on BluRay in my local Poundland. Possibly the best buy ever, and even more so to find an abundance of extra features that also include an alternate ending with a pretty sweet fight scene between legends Jackie Chan and Yu Rong Gwong that was such a treat to watch!!",The Karate Kid
62,griffolyon12,"Can you capture lightning in a bottle, twice?",9,13 June 2010,"That was the goal and ambition with the remake of the '80s cult classic, The Karate Kid, starring Jaden Smith (the son of Will) and Jackie Chan. Even through all the marked similarities between the original and this newer version, the film still manages to pack a powerful punch and deliver the thrills and cheers of the original with a bigger budget at its disposal.The story follows the original almost by verbatim, but instead of our hero moving from New Jersey to California, he moves from Detroit to Beijing, China where he learns Kung Fu, not Karate. But after all that, the scene structure is for the most part the same as the original. Our hero, Dre Parker (Jaden Smith) arrives in China, knowing nobody, but there is a shimmer of hope when he meets a cute Chinese girl whose interested in him, but he must contend with the bullies of his new school who train at the meanest and baddest Kung Fu Dojo around with a teacher who teaches them, ""No Mercy!"" But alas, Dre starts forging a relationship with the maintenance man at his apartment complex, Mr. Han (Jackie Chan), and Mr. Han starts teaching Dre Kung Fu in order to let him take on the bullies one-on-one at the big Kung Fu Tournament coming up.So yeah, in many spots, film kind of has a been there, seen it vibe to it all, in particular in the beginning and end. As it is, having seen the original, it is very hard to look past all of the similarities, especially since in the first hour or so you can pretty much predict what the next scene will be about, even what the dialogue will sometimes be. But of course, there is a reason it all worked the first time around, it's a good, crowd pleasing formula, and it still delivers even with different settings and characters. But there is a segment in the middle, when Dre finally starts learning Kung Fu from Mr. Han that the film really starts coming into its own and becomes its own entity.While the movie starts out exceedingly similar, the story quickly lets you know not all is the same. First they train Kung Fu, not Karate, and second, the main characters are not teenagers but rather kids, so it actually is a Karate Kid this time around. With it being kids, the romance plays as a first love sort of thing and not just a high school romance, so in those regards the film actually delivers far better. And they do Dre's training in such a way that it feels vastly different, and in many ways his training is the highlight of the film, such as when Mr. Han and Dre train in the courtyard at night and their silhouettes and their shadows race across the walls; the scene is iconic.The acting was very spot on. While Jaden Smith's Dre was very similar in emotional reaction as Ralph Macchio's Daniel, he did a fine job. As well, Jackie Chan's Mr. Han is not just a mirror version of Mr. Miyagi. Mr. Miyagi was Pat Morita, and in this film it feels as if they tailored Mr. Han to fit better with Chan's own abilities and own screen persona. Mr. Han does not have as many one-liners as Mr. Miyagi, and he is far more serious of a person than Miyagi. In particular, where as Mr. Miyagi was kind of like Daniel's crazy uncle or friend, Mr. Han becomes more like Dre's father by the end of the film. These vast differences in characterizations between Mr. Han and Mr. Miyagi is actually one of the finer aspects of this film, and I've gotta say I've never seen Jackie Chan deliver such a fine dramatic performance.So while it is all predictable, if you have no knowledge of the '80s romp you're gonna love it, and even if you do have knowledge of the original, you're still gonna get a good kick out of watching Dre fighting to the top of the heap, cause the formula still works. With slight, subtle differences in story, the film manages to come into its own just enough for anyone to enjoy, and to put it simple, it's the best around.I give The Karate Kid a 9 out of 10!",The Karate Kid
63,Min111,Bad remake,1,11 August 2020,"I seen the movie. It was a remake of ""The Karate Kid"" made in the eighties who I'm sure everyone remembers. That was a good movie. It's an eighties classic! The remake copied many things in the original movie. That was clear. It should've been ""totally"" different. The movie would've been better that way. The Karate Kid (remake) is bad. It's a poor attempt of The Karate Kid (1984). I actually felt sorry for Jackie Chan for being in the movie. He played Mr Han who is a martial arts master, and trains the little boy named Dre Parker in becoming an expert fighter. They become friends. He's also a maintenance man. He fixes things. Mr Han was the only right character in the movie. Jaden was clearly a wrong choice, and there should've been someone else in his place. You can tell he wasn't meant for the role. It would've been better with a white and older kid. He gets attacked by a bunch of Chinese kids at school. One of the attackers is named Cheng who will fight him at the tournament. His teacher is Master Li who tells his pupils to show no mercy to anyone. I know. Master Li is a bad teacher. It's been agreed that the boy, Dre, is left alone, so he can train until they meet at the tournament. His mother's name is Sherry Parker. They move to China from USA cause of a new job. This is something I don't understand. Why can't Sherry find a job in America? Instead of having to move all the way to China just cause of a new job. Everyone knows America is the greatest country to live on Earth, so I don't understand why they don't remain there. China is on the other side of the world. It doesn't make sense. Also, it's strange to see a family of black background living in China. It's uncommon. I'm not surprised Dre don't like it here. He wants to go back home. I don't blame him. Looks like the boy didn't have a say in this when he should. The Karate Kid (2010) would've been better had it taken place in America. Also, it's not really Karate they learn. It's more like Kung Fu, and the movie should've been called by a different name. The title is misleading. I didn't like that. I don't know what the producers were thinking. It's silly. The Karate Kid (2010) is a bad remake. It's better to watch The Karate Kid (1984) than The Karate Kid (2010). You won't regret it. The Karate Kid (2010) is a waste of time. It's a poor copy. The only good thing was Jackie Chan. It stops there. I'm not a fan of remakes. These things never work. Anyway, Can Dre win the tournament? You need to see it to find out. Dre Parker looks like Bruce Lee or Marshal Law (Tekken) with the thing he's wearing at the tournament.",The Karate Kid

65,the-movie-guy,A story worth seeing again,8,8 June 2010,"(Synopsis) Dre Parker (Jaden Smith) is a 12-year-old living in Detroit when his mother Sherry (Taraji Henson) gets a job in China. Once in China, Dre misses home and wants to go back to the US. His mother tells him that China is home now, and he must learn to accept his new home. Dre begins to like China when he falls for his classmate Mei Ying (Wenwen Han). Dre's feelings for Mei Ying are seen by Cheng (Zhenwei Wang) the class bully who is out to stop it. Cheng puts Dre to the ground with ease using his Kung Fu training. Dre doesn't have a chance using the little karate that he knows, and Cheng proves it the next time he sees Dre. Dre is getting beaten badly when Mr. Han (Jackie Chan) the maintenance man, secretly a Kung Fu Master, stops the fight. Dre persuades Mr. Han to teach him Kung Fu. With this knowledge, Dre must now face down Cheng in a fight to win his respect in a Kung Fu tournament.(My Comment) This is somewhat of a remake of the Karate Kid. The script brings an international flavor to the screen in this bully-victim who turns martial arts expert and eventual hero. The storyline is the one where the underdog must fight to prove himself, and in the meantime everyone learns a lesson about life. The film belongs to Jaden Smith, the son of Will Smith, who dominates about every scene of the film. His screen presence is simply amazing for such a young person. Jackie Chan's portrayal is rather awesome as Dre's teacher. The film can stand on its own, because the setup is totally different than the original. All mothers will love it when Dre learns to hang his jacket up and not leave it on the floor. There are some beautiful mountain and Great Wall of China scenes that are used in getting Dre into shape. You almost begin to wonder if the story was changed, and Dre may not be able to finish the match by the end of the movie. The film was simply fun to watch with some touching moments and the Kung Fu was outstanding. This is a go to movie. (Columbia Pictures, Run Time 2:06, Rated PG) (8/10)",The Karate Kid

67,dilipbts,The karate kid,7,10 June 2020,"Let's make it clear from the beginning, The Karate Kid is a blatant vehicle for Jaden Smith, with his all too famous father Will producing the movie in an attempt to bolster his son's acting career. Much like the criticism that Shane Meadow's Somers Town garnered for its association with Eurostar, it could be argued that the Karate Kid is a cleverly crafted two and a half hour long advert for Jaden Smith. That being said, it's a fairly well polished advert with Jaden putting in a solid performance, the only criticism that can be levelled at Smith is his age; the original Karate Kid was much older, broadening the films appeal to a wider audience, but as I watched pre-teens fighting I couldn't help feeling that this would alienate the teen audience as they will struggle to relate to the main character.Don't get me wrong, the original is hardly a masterpiece, as is clear from its recent relegation to the library of channel five Sunday afternoon family films that are usually only worth watching for the memories they rekindle, but in 1984 the influence it had over popular culture was widespread, with teens everywhere desperate to take up martial arts. There is no doubt that the new version will inspire a similar wave of interest and while this may indicate a certain amount of popularity, it is no indication of the film's quality, which doesn't come close to the sheer entertainment of the original.Without comparing the two versions, The Karate Kid is a fairly entertaining movie, it has its flaws - most notably its length, but children oblivious to the original will love watching Dre Parker (Jaden Smith) start a new life in China while finding his feet with the local gang. Jackie Chan puts in a stirling performance as Mr Han, the caretaker and karate master who dedicates his time to training Dre and teaching him the true art of karate, that shows he can actually act.The story arc remains very similar to the original with the main alteration being the setting, which provides some fantastic backdrops for the street battles and a striking training scene on the great wall of China. Visually the film is impressive and the acting is okay, but remakes are never going to compare favourably to their predecessors and a change to one of the most memorable scenes in the film (""wax on, wax off"") will be seen as blasphemous by fans of the original.This is definitely a film for the younger generation, people familiar with the 1984 version should stay well away but those heading into the film without preconceptions formed from viewing the original will find a fairly enjoyable story that is very easy to watch. As i know most people reading this will have seen the original, save your money, and if you haven't seen the karate kid, you're missing out on an eighties classic - go and buy the DVD now and forget about the new version.

This abomination ranks up there with other remakes of movies such as The Jungle Book, Arthur, The A Team and Rollerball, etc. But it happened and Hollywood got rich and the audiences got duped... AGAIN!The story: A horrible and annoying black woman takes her little girl to China. The wee lass meets a creepy, sullen old man and in a bizarre turn of events, she gets entered into a Kung Fu competition even though she's never done a day of martial arts training in her life. Despite the diminutive doll getting a really good beating, the mother is on the sidelines laughing it up and hollering her support. In the end, the girl stands on one foot and beats her enemy and all the odds.The story is backed up by hilarious, comedy fight scenes and frankly bizarre musical numbers... including a bastardization of a Stevie Wonder classic.

This film uses many of the topics and ways of the old film and transforms it into a modern day version, they are still very relevant today but in different ways.It is an easy to watch film, it entertains, but it is not really living up to expectations from the first of the old films. The nostalgia is there and all the references, but there are just some things that are not working as good as the memories of the old one.None of the sequels to the first movie really worked as well as the first one and I believe it would be the same with this, so I hope they will not spoil it and make any sequels.",The Karate Kid
70,blackmamba99971,Excellent Adaptation,10,18 June 2010,"For some who cannot relate to a new approach to an old classic should not do reviews. I found that this was a great representation to the original movie. Using Jackie Chan was brilliant to teach Dre (Smith) the fine arts of Kung Fu using modern day tedious tasks. Something we all do in a manner of sorts, without even knowing it. Dre a twelve year old student, on a trip with his mom to china and to settle down after she accomplishes her employment status does Dre fall into some trouble. His only means of protecting himself is to learn the arts through everyday rituals leading to more complex versions. Jackie Chan was excellent in his portrayal of a maintenance man who by happenstance, loses his wife and child in a bad car accident. Living his life as a lonely hermit, Dre and Han (Chan) begin to bond a close friendship, thus leading to Dre's training. In the middle of his training his close best friend Meiying (Wenwen Han) becomes his inspiration to reach higher than he has before, and to stop the fear within himself. The cast was great, the fights were top notch, and the lessons of life are given in the smallest forms for which the Chinese citizens have integrated into their lives as second nature. Dre becomes his own self as he goes to a tournament to finally once and for all stop the demons that toil in his soul. And this was a fantastic way to do it. Great film, Great story, And great Actors, like father like son. Jayden is going to go a long way. Hopefully for a sequel with our legend, Jackie Chan.",The Karate Kid

My answer: absolutely.I was absolutely absorbed into the movie due to it's surprisingly very good acting, convincing plot, great fight sequences, and even a sweet romance between Jaden Smith's and Wenwen Han's character.The film even has an exciting climax where Jaden smith's character enlists in a kung-fu tournament and we just want him to win, which I will not spoil for you.If you like movies about kung-fu and you like Jaden Smith and Jackie Chan, this is a must-see.",The Karate Kid
72,xamtaro,"Forget the ""Kung Fu! Not Karate!"" title debate and just watch this great show.",8,25 June 2010,"One might get the wrong impression when a film's title has nothing to do with its subject matter. The film in question is called ""The Karate Kid"", presumably a remake of the 1984 coming of age classic starring Ralph Macchio and Pat Morita which has absolutely NOTHING to do with karate. The martial art featured in the film is Chinese kung fu and barring a few similarities in the broad story strokes, 2010's ""The Karate Kid"" bears little resemblance to its source material. So instead of ""Karate"" we have Kung Fu. Instead of a high school senior love triangle with teenager testosterone rivalry, we have pre-pubescent puppy dog crushes, playground bullies and the very familiar ""new kid in a strange new land"" story combined with a garden variety underdog tale of a bullied protagonist who gets back on his feet and perseveres against all odds to come out on top. Now the underdog tale is nothing new, all that is different is the ""sport"" that serves as the story backdrop; Rocky had boxing, Fast And Furious Tokyo Drift had drift racing.In ""The Karate Kid"", A heartwarming opening montage introduces us to Dre Parker (Jaden Smith) who is made to move from Detroit to Beijing when his widowed mother gets a job transfer. Back home, he was well loved by his friends and neighbors, but now in China, Dre is a true ""fish out of water"", unable to speak the most basic of Chinese or even get the building's maintenance man, Mr Han (Jackie Chan) to fix his new home's broken water heater. Before his first day at school, Dre develops a cute crush on a demure Chinese girl called Mei Ying and manages to incur the wrath of the school bully, Cheng, who so happens to be a top kung fu student. Dre learns that last fact the hard way by getting beaten up, bullied and humiliated every day. Determined not to back down, Dre decides to stand up to his adversaries. But that only results in a near lynching until he is saved by Mr Han who reveals himself as an ex-kung fu master. After easing Dre's injuries, Mr Han takes the boy to go and make peace with Cheng's Master, Li. However, the cruel Master Li, who teaches his students an exceedingly brutal form of kung fu, threatens Han and forces Dre to competing in a Martial Arts tournament. With no other choice left, Mr Han begins to teach the boy ""real kung fu"", which is far from being just a means of fighting.""Karate Kid"" is a rare type of film that plays very close to the heart without giving the impression of forced melodrama. Anyone who has ever been through childhood would probably be able to relate to the trials young Dre goes through; from wanting to step away from his parent's overprotective shadow to learning to assert his own individuality. It is a painful but valuable lesson in growing up that Dre goes through and his turmoil is effectively conveyed thanks to the superb acting by young Jaden Smith.The twelve year old son of veteran actors Will Smith and Jada Pinkett Smith shows off his wide acting talent in his first lead role. He brings a down-to-earth sense of earnestness with just the right mixture of attitude to his role. As a result, Dre comes across as very easy to relate to and a likable protagonist whom the audience might gladly cheer on. All the other child actors are impeccable in their roles to the point where it is easy to forget that they are acting and get totally absorbed into the story and its characters. Special mention goes to Jackie Chan in his role of Mr Han. A departure from his usual comedic roles, Mr Han is played as a stern middle aged man whose quirky ways and wise traditional kung fu teachings masks a tragic secret. Easily the most interesting and well developed character, maybe even more so than the protagonist, and a solid effort by Chan.Hidden beneath ""Karate kid's"" layered narrative is a smart jibe at China's increasingly competitive education system. The contrast between Mr Han's traditional ideals of Kung Fu as a skill that leads to self mastery and Master Li's dogma of kung fu as a merciless means to dominate one's opponent highlights the very real system where everyone would do anything, even playing it dirty, to get to the top; where tradition is regarded more as a hindrance, where parents expect nothing but the best from their children and where second place means utter disgrace.As realistic as the story and characters are, some suspension of disbelief is required when it comes to the actual kung fu fighting. Seeing young boys, years away from breaking their voice, throw flying flip kicks with a level of professional expertise beyond any world class Olympics champ, puts a great strain on anyone trying to take the film seriously. The stunts are perfect, the fights are beautifully choreographed, but perhaps it was too good a job that resulted in a lessening of the realism factor.With a roaring soundtrack by James Horner, ""The Karate Kid"" has all the makings of a timeless classic just like the original film it is based on. It is fun, smart and touches on themes that anyone who has ever had a childhood might be able to easily relate to. All one has to do is put aside the discrepancy between the title and the featured martial art in order to fully enjoy this movie.",The Karate Kid
73,DavidYZ,Grossly inferior remake,2,22 July 2017,"I don't know why this Beijing-set remake was successful. It's inferior to the original in several respects. It's longer and there are a lot of boring scenes. The acting is much worse. The protagonist is twelve (as opposed to seventeen) which makes the theme and storyline less believable. He lacks the likability of the original film's protagonist. The martial art here is kung fu, which makes the film's title nonsensical.",The Karate Kid
74,tankace,Why to make it?,5,12 May 2016,"Karate Kid of 2010 is the remake of the classic 0f 1982, with is a great underdog story with a teenage who becomes a hero. We were going to see something similar and so good in about twenty years with Sam Raimi Spiderman, unlike this useless remake. To start why to make it? Even from a business point of view it does not make sense, the last karate kid , the Next was a critical and box office bomb and it was showed about 16 years after the remake. But against all odds it was a commercial hit making about three and a half times world its huge budget of 40 million. The only logical reason for that is the nostalgia , it is common knowledge that the last decade Hollywood has being out of ideas and it remakes everything that has a cult follow in order to cash in and like most of them the commercialization is obvious to a point of madness. This flick does not even have karate in it ,only fancy dance moves and the acting is forced by everyone, even Jackie Chan ,who usually with his moves and one liners can make a stupid film entertaining and here they did not used that!! Do not see it this flick, the fact that is largely forgotten proves its originality. In conclusion this was a victory for the cash cowing of nostalgia and a defeat for every person , who loves the original Karate Kid.",The Karate Kid
75,mikeiskorn,Good remake,6,24 January 2021,"A good remake which nodded its head to the original a few times, which was nice. A great modern story remake although I just couldn't get passed Jaden being lead sometimes. Just a few times his acting was off but his character just seemed out of place. A little unrealistic. Despite that, still a good movie to check out.",The Karate Kid
76,gregberne11,"It's Like the Original, Except with No ""Karate"", and Everyone - Including the Audience - Wants to Punch the ""Kid""",1,8 July 2019,"Take the original classic film ""Karate Kid"". Replace beloved actor Pat Morita with still beloved Jackie Chan. Unfortunately this remake will still be far too good.So next, replace Ralph Macchio with a blatant nepotism hire. How about Will Smith's son, who has never demonstrated any discernible acting talent whatsoever? He can mug-face his way through every scene with the emotional depth on a kumquat. Need him to be hurt about his dead dad? He can say he's sad. Need him to be angry? He can talk with a bit more volume. Need him to take his jacket off and on again a hundred times? He can do that too! This ""karate kid"" oozes versatility.Also let's make the movie more than two and a half hours long for no reason other than to include several montages of ridiculous training. Definitely Jackie Chan should take Jaden Smith to the Great Wall of China at least five times to run around on it, because there are no stairs to exercise on in Beijing. It was very nice of all the tourists and locals to stay away from the Great Wall to allow this child to train for his local karate (er, kung fu) contest.We for sure need Jackie to take Jaden to a mystical mountain so he can drink magic karate juice (er, kung fu juice) from a ying/yang bowl, and watch a woman taunt a snake on the side of a mountain, because that's how you learn something something chi.Let's also give this kung fu only ""karate kid"" an American friend immediately upon landing in China (where Jaden's on screen mom made him more for the super good reason of having a better life in a dumpy apartment with no hot water, but let's not get hung up on her because she's pretty much never around except to yell ""pick up your jacket"" five or six times. This American friend should be bilingual, speak up for Jaden when the bullies show up (again, no motivation for them is required), and then completely disappear from the movie until the end when he is sitting with Jaden's mom in the karate (er, kung fu) tournament audience for some reason.When his leg gets broken, his mom should wander into the medical room very late, after the doctor is finished his examination and doctoring, then leave after about ten seconds of worrying, then sit back in the audience even though her son's leg is badly injured and she doesn't think he'll be fighting any more, but then when she sees him fighting again, and get his leg BROKEN, all she should do is cheer her head off with apparently zero concern for her stupid kung fu doing Karate Kid.Also Jaden needs a romantic interest. How about a girl who plays violin who he also meets immediately after arriving at his new apartment, who conveniently speaks perfect English, and who is not put off at all by the fact that Jaden is a gigantic loser who shoots a basketball with the grace of a spastic koala and gets beaten down at ping-pong by a 98 year old man in a stained white undershirt he apparently took off a dead man.We also need a bad guy, but unlike the original movie where he gets screen time and, you know, a NAME, let's just have him be a jerk who's mean to Jaden and likes to hurt kids for, I guess, reasons.This movie is now terrible enough to be a modern Hollywood remake. But just to make sure it's a total dud, let's also give it a really awful soundtrack. Who can we get to provide some of the music? Oh I know, how about also Jaden Smith! His dad was the Fresh Prince, so obviously he, at the age of 12 or whatever, must have the innate chops to write and perform some really great tunes.The story is the same as Karate Kid. New kid in town, bullies don't like him, the nice Chinese man (who eats with chopsticks covered in fly guts) rescues him and trains him by having him do a stupid chore then enters him without asking in a karate (er, kung fu) tournament. Stupid training for a few days or forever (it's hard to tell) then they go to the tournament where there are millions of dollars worth of screens and graphics and raving fans. Then just like in the first movie the Karate Kid who does kung fu only somehow has picked up the ancient art of looking at his final opponent with hypnotic snake eyes to entrance him.The only really disappointing part, other than the entire stupid movie, is that after this Karate Kid wins the karate (er, kung fu) tournament on a broken leg with nothing other than sheer determination (and the aid of wires and CGI), instead of the nameless Bad Guy fighting Jackie Chan and getting his butt kicked (which is a great part of the original movie because it showed that Morita was a great fighter who simply had been choosing not to fight because of the strength of his character), all we get is him making a ""no way!"" disappointed face after his kid loses the tournament.",The Karate Kid
77,Jackpollins,Excellent remake,9,14 June 2010,"I will admit, with its 2 hours & 20 minutes running time, I was skeptical going into The Karate Kid. That said, that was all changed when I watched the movie. This is an excellent remake of the 1984 original with Jaden Smith in the Ralph Macchio role and Jackie Chan in the Pat Morita role. Smith & Chan both get to show their emotional side, but the real power to them comes during the fight scenes. These are some of the most well choreographed fight scenes in recent memory. Chan is not as good as a while back when he did Police Story, Mr. Nice Guy or Jackie Chan's First Strike, but come on, be lenient on him, he's aging, and he's still got the magic for the most part. I liked the relationship between Dre (Smith) and his mother Sherry (Taraji P. Henson), they have a sweet and honest relationship in the film. Dre falls for a Chinese girl who's the most adorable little girl ever put on film, almost. In a world of bad remakes, this one stands out as one of the good ones. It's funny, sweet, well-acted, with a great China location and the fight scenes are something of a miracle. This is one of my favorite movies of the year so far, and that's saying a lot.",The Karate Kid
78,TheHonestCritic,"This is one of the laziest and shameless excuses of a movie I have ever seen! Pat Morita, who played Mr. Miyagi, would not have been pleased with this ""movie"".",4,21 October 2019,"""The Karate Kid"" (2010), or should it actually be known as ""The Kung Fu Kid""? Seriously, if you're going to make a movie called ""The Karate Kid"", you better include some karate! Okay, Film Making 101: if you're going to make a movie, the title needs to match the subject matter! This ""film"" has a lazy story, overall terrible acting and an underwhelming soundtrack. Wow, where do I begin with the storyline? It's basically just taking the plot from the original movie, replacing the word ""karate"" with ""Kung Fu"", changing the locations and the characters names. I do respect the fact that they were trying something different by changing the location and character names to try something different. Sadly, at the end of the day it just did not work. But probably the most annoying factor is that it has to do with Kung Fu in a movie called ""The Karate Kid"". If it was called ""The Kung Fu Kid"" it could have maybe been it's own standalone movie and have an actual excuse for existing. They were on the right track by changing the elements, character names and locations. But the overall execution was just done horribly. Why isn't it called ""The Kung Fu Kid""?! Sorry if I seem to be harping on this, but that just steers this ""film"" in the wrong direction. As for the acting, it's all over the place. It ranges from standard, to just bad. Jackie Chan is good, as usual and an interesting choice as Mr. Miyagi. However, in this ""movie"" he is named Mr. Han instead. Jaden Smith is good in some parts of the ""film"", but overall he is just cringeworthy and obnoxious! Taraji P. Henson as Dre's mother is just the cringeworthy and obnoxious counterpart to him. Like mother, like son? If that was to be the case, then that performance was spot on! The villains played by Zhenwei Wang as Cheng is bad to standard, and Yu Rongguang as the main villain, Master Li, was way too over the top. The soundtrack is very disappointing, there are some decent parts. But overall, it was just underwhelming for me. They included a Justin Bieber song! Why?! I cannot stand Justin Bieber! Most of the rest of the soundtrack is just your cliched fish out of water story soundtrack. The only good elements in this ""movie"" are the special effects and the sets/locations. Being a fairly new movie, the special effects are a given. Which is not saying much! The sets/locations are beautiful. China is a beautiful country, and I really do love seeing different Asian cultures expressed in movies. It really gave this ""film"" a nice atmosphere, and set the tone perfectly. But unfortunately, those two elements did not save this ""movie"". I give this ""film"" a 2 out of 5 star rating, which equates to 4 out of 10 stars. Here's a little advice for future film makers: do not do any remakes or reboots. Yes, sometimes you get a good one, but for the most part they are just entirely pointless and shows that you're running out of ideas. Be creative and come up with your own unique story ideas. Be original! If you must do a remake or reboot, you better do the original justice. Take notes, Disney studios! Everyone, do yourselves a favor and kick this ""movie"" to the curve. It's not even worthy of a white belt!",The Karate Kid
79,cosmic_quest,A tad silly,5,17 June 2011,"While I enjoyed the original 'The Karate Kid', I am a couple of years too young to say I hold great nostalgia for it so I was not that bothered to hear of the remake (other than wonder why Hollywood can't think up new ideas any more). Since watching this, I doubt it will be held in the same regard by children and young teens today as the original was.The film revolved around twelve-year-old Dre whose mother's job forces them to move to China. Life is hard enough adjusting to the cultural and language changes but then finds himself the focus of a gang of Kung Fu-trained bullies after he is caught flirting with a girl in their class. Luckily, the local martial artist handyman Mr Han takes Dre under his wing and teaches him the skills to fight the bullies in an upcoming Kung Fu tournament.The main problem with this film was the ages of the young cast. Jaden Smith, who played Dre, seems to have trained for the film but he looks no more than a tiny ten-year-old child (I think he actually was only about ten at the time of filming) and he looks far too young and soft for such active fighting. At that age, he shouldn't be expected to fend off bullies alone, and his mother and teachers should be intervening to help him. It doesn't help that Dre went from picking up his jacket to becoming a wonderful martial artist who can take on kids who have been training since infancy in a matter of weeks. We see little of his progress or anything to convince us of his newfound skills.In the original film, it worked that Daniel was in his late teens and felt he was too old to look for parental help, and his bullies were the same age as him. Dre's 'love interest' and the bullies look a good two to four years older than him, making the whole situation even more ridiculous. Even then, the bullies are still kids too so when Mr Han, with Jackie Chan in the role, looked like an oaf beating them up when he should have dragged them all home to their parents.Another major point is that this isn't the early Eighties any more. Hollywood remember when producing remakes that what was acceptable decades ago is not what we would put up with today. Six kids physically beating up another boy to the extent that they could have seriously injured or killed him is not something that you just shove under the rug. It is an offence and would probably be a police concern today.In terms of the film, I think primary school children would very likely enjoy it but anyone older would find these points a bit hard to swallow. With a little thought and a young cast aged around sixteen then this film might have been of more interest. As it is, it's something I would watch as background noise.",The Karate Kid
80,NightmareOnElmStreetFan,Kung Fu Kid - good remake Jackie Chan is the only good reason to watch this,7,8 February 2019,"Kung Fu Kid - good remake Jackie Chan is the only good reason to watch this
In my opinion this film was better than any sequels were made. I have enjoy it more than 3 and 4 which was ridicules. It is not better than the original but better than 2 lousy horrible sequels in my opinion. Jackie Chan rules I love his performance in this movie. The Karate Kid (2010) is great fun to watch It shows great values and lessons about life. I like the film a lot.Jackie Chan was great his best performance in 2010 this one and in Skiptrace (2016) are really great films he made. I like them much more than the movies Jackie Chan is doing today. Jaden Smith is good in his performance as little Dre Parker. Will Smith and his wife Jada Pinkett Smith produced this film and I am glad they trust Jackie Chan in the lead as Mr. Han. I love the Chinese culture used and showed in this film. This movie is about Kung Fu than Karate and should have been titled Kung Fu Kid but it really didn't bother me that much I have enjoy the film.2 things did bother me in the film: 1: In the fight scene in which Mr. Han fights those Kung Fu kids you can see he ties them with some rope that same scene was used in American Shaolin. This movie stole that scene from American Shaolin.The second thing that bothers me the movie is too long 2 hrs and 20 minutes. It could have been shorter because between the film the opera scenes becomes really boring. In my opinion it was a good remake and a good film I like it. I enjoy it much more than 3 and 4. I have the film in my Blu-ray collection. Harald Zwart made a good direction and writers Christopher Murphey and Robert Mark Kamen did a good job with a script.I gave this film a pass for Jackie Chan's best performance. I like this movie much more than The Karate Kid Part III and The Next Karate Kid those two movies in my opinion are both stinkers! The remake I can not rant because it was really good I absolutely love the training sequences between Jackie and Jaden I love this film.",The Karate Kid
81,Ryan_MYeah,"Keeps to the spirit of the original, but the fact is it's just too long.",7,3 January 2011,"To give myself a break from the glut of award hopefuls this year, I saw The Karate Kid, a remake of the original 1984 film. I was so disappointed by it. It was most certainly NOT about Karate, it was about Kung Fu. Talk about false advertising! Sony Pictures will never hear the end of this from me, but martial arts style aside, as a piece of family entertainment, it's alright.It stars Jaden Smith as Dre Parker, a young boy who moves to Beijing with his mother, leaving behind their past lives in Detroit. Once Dre arrives, he falls for a young girl in his school, but is also picked on by ruthless bullies trained by an infinitely ruthless kung fu instructor. With the help of a mysterious maintenance man named Mr. Han (Played by Jackie Chan), Dre learns the ways of kung fu, and balance of the stability of mind, in order to win a tournament, and suppress his natural fear.It doesn't quite hold a candle to the original film, but it still keeps to the same spirit, and heart which, albeit predictable, made the original so good. For one particular scene, I practically had to force myself not to cry. And the cast, while somewhat hit or miss, is helpful towards the movie's cause. Jaden Smith and Jackie Chan carry a huge chunk of the movie on their shoulders, and share excellent chemistry together.Other things I liked about the movie include the lovely cinematography and production design, and I really enjoyed the kung fu sequences, which were exceptionally choreographed and edited, and then there's the score by James Horner which, though schmaltzy at times, has some VERY lovely compositions. And the film's third act is action packed, and ambitiously tense.It would be very easy for me to call it a good movie if it weren't for one thing: The Karate Kid is, plain and simple, just too long. They could have easily shaved 12 to 15 minutes off of the film's overall running time, and have had the same emotional impact, maybe even a better impact. At nearly 2 and a half hours, it just moves too slow, and the first half specifically has a tendency to drag.I still enjoyed The Karate Kid, plenty more than enough to give it **1/2 out of ****",The Karate Kid

84,mrcibubur,Splendid family film with the wrong title completely,7,1 July 2010,"this is a very enjoyable family film, as most Jackie Chan films are. though not as funny as Spy Next Door, there are plenty of chuckles along the way. the film for me is more in the mould of 'My name is Khan' and even 'The Wrestler' (in an extreme way) in wanting to deliver a message to its audience but there is not a single bit of karate in the movie, so be warned! It really should be called 'Kung Fu Kid' but never mind, the film entertains.Jackie Chans role as Mr Hun is somewhat limited as the maintenance man. I found the boy as Dre at times annoying and I was not sure what his Mother was transferred to china to do of such importance but never mind that. I enjoyed the relationship formed by the boy with Mr Hun who had lost his family some years before in a car accident, hence his guilt complex.The film addresses through Chan how to become a better person and to use kung fu in a positive way. he was responsible for the death of his family and he wants to be righteous again. through the boy there was clearly a message for him to show that you don't need to use violent means to practice an art like kung fu.The storyline is a little clumsy but nevertheless good and the filming around china exceptional.this is a very worthwhile film to see and should not be missed.",The Karate Kid
85,perkypops,I love Jackie Chan but....,3,21 June 2011,"Jackie Chan is one of my favourite martial arts artistes because he is fabulously gifted but doesn't take himself too seriously. He is as good as he can be in this film too which means it is a pity the rest of the casting was so poor.I am sure Jaden Smith tried very hard in this film but I regret to say he just doesn't and didn't convincingly hack the whole point of martial arts. Now either he was badly miscast or someone really didn't care how casting him reflected on the movie's ambition.I regret to say that Chan apart this was one of the most pretentious martial arts films I have witnessed. It is awful simply because like one of its stars it simply doesn't get the whole martial art ""thing"". And yet in the brilliantly shot visit to Chan's training ground there was so much promise.And so I would rename this film - ""Karate? You're kidding me."" Barely a three out of ten but I give it that because Chan deserves so much better after all he has given to movies throughout his illustrious career.",The Karate Kid

I'd say it's a good enough film to get a few moments of enjoyment at least!",The Karate Kid
87,colinrgeorge,"Overlong, But A Focused, Contemporary Remake",6,11 June 2010,"Sure, I went through a brief martial arts phase as a kid—I just didn't have the attention span to devote myself to the discipline (Really, I think I just liked the idea of colored belts). Consequently, my grazing interest in the eastern fighting styles took me only as far as the ninja turtles; I saw the original ""Karate Kid"" last week.Its remake, which swaps sunny California for China and Ralph Macchio for Will Smith's son Jaden, plays by the same basic rules as the 1984 version, and despite a strikingly similar screenplay, manages to feel distinct through its subtle updates in plot, protagonist, and setting.Carefully arranged and deliberately paced, this new ""Kid"" is anything but a quick cash-grab. It's a carefully, almost delicately constructed film, but like the original, one that overstays its welcome at two plus hours. The pacing is curious for several reasons, not the least of which (as I might once have whined) is the attention spans of its target audience.Normally, I would defend a film that takes its time telling the story, but both versions of ""The Karate Kid"" suffer from thematic redundancy. Every scene with our hero fleeing from oppressive bullies, wooing the girl, or training under his enigmatic master (a respectable turn by Jackie Chan this time around) serves the same principle function, and when you ultimately shortchange the audience on a convincing progression anyway, there's no reason not to trim the excess.But those boring patches are generally made up for by the surprisingly intense fight sequences—Especially from an audio perspective. The impact of each blow is authoritative, loud, and visceral, and during key showdowns, my audience became a chorus of 'oofs' and applause. ""The Karate Kid"" is a crowd-pleaser, no question, and a lot of fun to hear a reaction to.The brutality of the combat is also surprising because the film is made and marketed for children and their parents. I don't think anyone who sits down to watch a movie about kids fighting each other has much elbowroom for offense, but many may be expecting something tamer. ""The Karate Kid"" also has a strong moral core, teaching the tried and true self- defensive approach to practicing martial arts. Above all, it's nice to see a film with almost an entire cast of children that doesn't talk down or pander to a young crowd.Of course, it suffers like so many sports dramas do, from the inherent predictability of an underdog story—And doubly so as remake of an existing film. 2010's ""Karate Kid"" suffers from a lack of genuine surprises, but polishes it's tired archetypes to a like-new finish; which is fortunate, because Jackie Chan swatting a fly is about the extent of the filmmakers' willingness to innovate.Still, it's a movie that's just too adorable to stay mad at. Chan and Smith work well together, validating the latter as a genuine talent (even if it's largely as a carbon copy of his father), and contributing to the former's best performance in years. Their bond is convincing, and their relationship is the emotional anchor for this more serious take on the 1984 original.It's worth noting that 2010's ""Karate Kid"" has no actual karate in it, since Chan and China dictate kung fu be the more socially relevant discipline. I imagine this may confuse inspired kids, who show up disappointed to their first week of karate class.Nevertheless, the film, like the values it teaches, is well balanced and focused. Maybe it would be more fun if it were aggressively on the narrative offense—But I guess that would be against the rules, wouldn't it?",The Karate Kid
88,thekyles99,80's version vs new remake... 80's win!!!!,5,23 January 2011,"It took me a while and a whole bunch of sittings that were disturbed since its arrival on DVD however I finally sat down with the family for our ritual Sunday morning movie and watched the new version of The Karate Kid. i originally had no intention on viewing a version i figured would be the original word for word and if I'm going to watch a remake and want to see another director's vision on a film i want to see something remade such as The Exorcist or per say Star Wars. Movies that get remade such as this one i'm pretty much like they didn't need to do this and i couldn't care less. Well i was right on one thing they stole way too many lines from the original but on the other hand director Harald Zwart added his own flair and panache to a lot of the story. I liked the fact that the background and locale was China ( i figure they added parts from 1 and 2 to come up with where they were going to shoot this film). The tournament at the end was done a little better too although much of the intensity i felt and still feel at times watching the 80's version just wasn't there in this one. I loved Pat Morita as Miyagi however i felt Jackie Chan was a hell of a lot better in the role maybe due to his martial arts expertise i don't know, he just nailed it. I have to admit having being a fan of Jackie's work in the cinema it took me much by surprise at the depth he showed in this film, even making me teary eyed during one sequence something i'm not used to at all from him.

90,Fields201,Looking forward to the sequel,8,11 September 2010,"When I first heard about a remake for Karate Kid, I was livid. Why, Hollywood? Why keep making these remakes? The Karate Kid was a beloved movie from my childhood. One person in particular that you couldn't mess with was Mr. Miyagi. Nobody plays Mr. Miyagi but Pat Morita. Then I found out that Jackie Chan was filling this role which made this a little bit interesting.The one that got the most attention was the casting of Will Smith's son, Jaden Smith, in the Daniel-san role. Keep in mind that I had no idea at the time that they were altering the names of these characters for the sake of the title ""Kung Fu Kid"" which, in my opinion, they should have stuck with, rather than rehashing the name ""Karate Kid."" Anyway, the film came over the summer and I made it a point to go see it. Yeah, I know. I'm giving money to a remake which means that Hollywood is going to remake more movies because I paid to see them. Well, they had Jackie Chan in it! I also wanted to see how closely they were going to stick to the source material.Well, it turns out that they stuck very close to the source material with a few changes here and there, like the setting. Instead of somewhere like Denver in the original (I think that's where Daniel moved to, it's been years since I saw it) they are now in Beijing, China. It works.In fact, the whole movie works for me. If there was one thing that they improved upon from the original, above anything else, was the fight choreography. Yeah, it was Wushu but it was impressive. The bullies Daniel, I mean Dre Parker, had to fight were actually pretty scary. I mean, if I was a kid with no fighting skills whatsoever, I'd be scared of these kids too. There's even a scene where Jackie Chan (character being Mr. Han but let's face it, he's Jackie Chan) had to fight these young kids but mainly had them fight each other. You still have it, Jackie Chan! If I had to name flaws in the film, I could think of a couple. For instance, the original 1984 Karate Kid told it's story in less time than this film. It's running time was like two hours while this film ran two and a half. That flaw can be backed up with that I had a fun two and a half hours with this film. The second flaw would be that early in the film, Dre befriends this little blonde kid as soon as he arrives to China. After Dre's first fight scene with those kids, you never hear from this blonde kid again. Um, why was he in this film then? That part was baffling. There's probably other flaws in this film, but those two stuck out more to me than anything else.I'm looking forward to buying it on DVD. Come to think of it, I better go out and get the original.",The Karate Kid
91,blacklist-1,A very worthy effort makes a competent remake. Highly enjoyable.,8,3 August 2010,"The Karate Kid remake starring Jaden Smith as Dre and Jackie Chan as Mr. Han had a lot to live up to in terms of the original which I absolutely loved. My dad introduced me to the films earlier this decade. In my opinion it dosen't quite make it, but it is still a very good effort and I for one thoroughly enjoyed it. I know there have been very mixed reviews on this website for those who grew up watching the original and didn't like this one. Let me tell you why I give this an eight out of ten.Some of the initial problems I had with this film was some of the story threads. Where for example is the back story of the principal villain and Mr. Hun? I also felt the principal villain wasn't very menacing. Put it this way he pales next to Martin Kove who played John Kreese who was a truly excellent nemesis. Also it really isn't Karate, it's Kung Fu as others have rightly pointed out, but that's a small gripe. Another criticism is I just didn't think it captured the true friendship between Dre and Mr. Hun. There wasn't really any emotional bond between them not like Mr. Miyagi and Daniel in the original and the script of the film isn't really that good. However I liked every other part of this film. The music is really great. Particularly the end soundtrack, the scenery itself was magnificent to look at, the action sequences were exciting and choreographed superbly, but the best thing is the acting. Jackie Chan gives a surprisingly charming and touching performance particularly when he cries in one scene where I had a tear in my eye, but Jaden Smith is the revelation. He has a natural charisma and charm on the screen just like his father. He is a terrific little star, his acting was really good. It comes as not much of a surprise that he has a natural acting talent like his dad. I saw him in the the remake on The Day the Earth Stood Still and he was good in that as well. He has a very bright future in acting ahead him. It's also a testament to him that he trained very hard for this film in terms of building up his muscles to keep himself fit. One surprise I will say for this film is the romantic element, which was secondary to the main story where he embarks on a close friendship with a Chinese violinist. The actress who played her couldn't really act but she had a nice screen charisma with a lovely smile. Jaden himself handled this part well and the romance was really quite sweet, sort of like a first teen romance. Overall this was a very long film of 140 minutes, but even though this has been severely criticised in a lot of ways. It didn't disappoint me and I think it is a very worthy remake that deserves to be seen on the big screen.",The Karate Kid
92,carologletree,A Mixed Bag; The Original Was Far Better,6,16 July 2017,"I remember when this movie came out in 2010. I was so mad that they were remaking ""The Karate Kid"" that I didn't even bother with this movie. I decided to watch it years later after getting over it. This wasn't a bad remake by any means; it had its highs and some lows as well.Jaden Smith is actually pretty good as Drey. While not quite as engaging as Ralph Macchio, he does a good job of showing vulnerability and gradual character growth throughout the film.The best part of this movie is Jackie Chan as Mr. Han. It's actually pretty hard to compare him to Pat Morita's Mr. Miyagi from the original. He is similar in some ways, but different in others, which I appreciated. Like Nostalgia Critic pointed out, whereas the original film had a teacher-student relationship, this one has the teacher and the student teaching each other, which is a nice new spin on it.However, there are many things about it that really don't work. I know that I'm not the first person to point this out, but this was really more like ""The Kung Fu Kid"" than ""The Karate Kid."" I respect that they tried to give us something new, but it still has to be karate if that's what's in the title.Another thing is that the supporting characters are nowhere near as appealing as in the original film. The main protagonist's mother, love interest, and even the villains are rather bland and forgettable.The film is too long and would have been tighter if it were maybe 20 minutes shorter.It still wasn't a bad movie. It's reasonably entertaining and will have you cheering in the end when Drey wins the tournament. However, this movie still didn't need to be made, and it pales in comparison to the original ""Karate Kid."" There's still enough here to warrant a slightly above-average grade.RATING: C+",The Karate Kid
93,kevin_crighton,"Overlong, but faithful remake, but needed a better title!",6,4 August 2010,"When Dre and his mother move to China, he runs foul of a group of pupils, from a Kung-Fu club. Rescued by Mr. Han, Dre is forced to enter a Kung-Fu tournament, and a reluctant Han has to teach him....This new version of The Karate Kid follows the original very faithfully. The key events from the original are re-created here, so if you've seen the original this movie has no surprises at all.The film-makers have made several changes though. Fist off, Dre is a younger character then Daniel was in the original. Second off, in the original Daniel and his mother move from East to West coast in the US. Here, the move is from the US to China. This does allow for a degree of homesickness for Dre to fuel some anger at his mother, and also some humour in his attempts at the Chinese language. Jaden Smith (son of Will Smith) is pretty good in the role, and there are moments where he does remind you a lot of his father.Jackie Chan, as Han is also pretty good. Unlike most of his roles, he only has one fight sequence, where he rescues Han, by using the attackers to hit each other. For the most part, he is more subdued than you are used to seeing Chan, and he too gives a very good performance.While the training sequences are not as good as the original, they are very well done. And the fight scenes are also very well put together.But the movie is far too long. It runs over 2 hours, and in truth could easily have lost 30 minutes of its running time, without detracting from the story.But the title is a problem. Considering there is no Karate in the movie (apart from a very brief sequence on TV), you have to wonder why they have called it that. I'm guessing it's only because The Kung-Fu Kid doesn't have the same ring to it.But this is a minor issue. As a remake it sticks faithfully to the original, possibly too faithfully. And it does have a rousing ending like the original.As a family movie it's not bad at all.",The Karate Kid

95,cadillac20,Great entertainment for those who remember the original and a new generation of kids who don't,8,14 June 2010,"Color me surprised. I would never have expected this film to vibe so well with critics, much less be the number one at the box office. So, with all that info in mind, I figured the film might be worth checking out. Sure enough, it was one fairly entertaining flick. Sure, it's not going to be one of the years best films. It's also fairly by the numbers. But it's highly entertaining and will definitely work well with the kids. The film takes many a cue from the original, with a plot that follows mostly the same pattern. The mis-titled film simply translates Karate into Kung-Fu and relocates to China. Dre, played by the charming Jaden Smith, moves with his mom to China, ends up running afoul of some Kung- Fu slinging bullies, and finds himself under the Kung-Fu tutelage of Jackie Chan's Mr. Han, who plays the role off as more of a loner and grouch than Pat Moriah's Mr. Miyagi. For those that know the original, nothing here is very new. There is a love interest, even for young Jaden. Jaden is fatherless, much like Daniel-san from the original. And Mr. Han even has a dark past, much like Mr. Miyagi, although I will say that I think Chan does a better job here, proving what most Chan fans know: Jackie Chan can act. But, the predictability is partly what makes this a great film. First of all, this is fantastic for the children. I can't imagine the kids being able to sit through the original, considering so much of that film never made it past the 80's. So, this update is actually a really good idea, as it is perfectly updated for the modern age, with the right mix of realistic Kung Fu action, melodrama that kids can love, and ""afterschool special"" lessons that kids are so privy to. I would go so far as to call this the years second best kids movie (behind How To Train Your Dragon). One thing definitely far superior to the original is the action. It's harder hitting, more realistic, and feels at home with actual Chinese martial artists than with a bunch of white kids pretending to be great Karate masters. I believed in the fights taking place here, something I never believed in in the original film, even as a kid. Everything else about the film is pretty much the same. The acting is different, of course. Jaden is much more charismatic than Ralph Macchio as the titular character, and I'm thankful for this. While Ralph will always be Daniel-san, and his acting was adequate to the film as the awkward, needs-to-get-stronger high schooler, I found Jaden far more entertaining. He definitely has the charm of his dad, and that adds to the films entertainment value. As for Chan, he is the perfect actor to carry over the Mr. Miyagi role. There is a bit of the usual Chan job in here, but he plays the role mostly serious and seeing him in the teachers role is great. It's a fantastic mix of his usual comedy and action, with some mostly unseen dramatic acting that Americans are sadly not privy to.Sadly, this film is being more criticized by the audience than it deserves. Expectations may kill it, but if you have young ones, let them see this movie. They will love it. As for fans of the original, you'll either love all the nods to the original, or hate the changes. Either way, I'm siding with the critics on this one and giving it a big thumbs up.",The Karate Kid
96,xlars,Right up there in the middle...,5,23 February 2014,"I'll start with the obvious. The original from 1984 was better. Much better. But then again that is why it was the Original. The Original is always better than the copy.When that is said, I cannot hide the fact that this is probably one of the best roles that Jackie Chan has ever done. First because it is down to earth, and not some hyped up role like many of the other role that he has done so many times before.How ever Chan's role was not hyped up. Jayden Smith is. He's to young to play this role at that time. It would be better left to be played when he was about 16-17, which he should be about now, during the writing of this review.While the film has its high points, especially with the fantastic geography of China, but the story and the plot is weak and lacks the chutzpah that this story ought to have.",The Karate Kid
97,RCWjr,This is how to do a remake,8,11 June 2010,"This movie, more so than any film this year, has had the most ""noise"" generated. Mostly from people ignorant of the film and just exactly how good or bad it is. The discussion has been centered on why call it ""The Karate Kid"" if he is learning Kung Fu. It is easy; the name is recognition and ""Kung Fu Kid"" sounds like a ripoff, not a remake and this is a remake and they are not hiding the fact. Enough said, explanation done, go back to your bowl of cereal.This film takes what was done in the original film and has nicely upgraded across the board. First, we have more of a threat from the kid doing the bullying this time around rather than a caricature. The mother/son dynamic is stronger and given much more screen time. The romance is more playful and innocent, with the friendship aspect ultimately being the plot focus. The student/teacher dynamic has an even stronger father/son underlying tone and finally, the action is much much improved upon.All of the above is due to excellent performances across the board. Jaden Smith shows to be a more than capable actor in the making and with no doubt observation of Chan, who we FINALLY get to see in a dramatic role rather than action/comedy role. Smith and Chan have a fun chemistry that helps make the film enjoyable.I was afraid through the ads that Smith's abilities would be over the top great, but through an excellent training montage and philosophical lessons, we buy that this kid is as good as he is in the tournament.A standout moment for me was the final bonding scene between Chan and Smith. It is during a moment reminiscent of the original film's scene where Daniel finds out about Mr. Miagi's family. Here, we have a similar scene, but it is what happens after it that establishes their relationship and seals the audiences relationship to these two characters. Excellent excellent scene.One other standout moment is the climax where they do a great job of ending the movie on a pitch perfect note. I had heard of audiences literally standing up and cheering, but I figured that was embellished. That is until the very same thing happened at the showing I caught this afternoon. You literally do want to stand up and cheer. They also take the moment a step further than the original did and provided an close to the lesson that Jackie's Mr Han was teaching Smith's Dre. It became a full circle lesson and really helped the movie have an even more satisfying end.The extended scenes of life in China really help to ground this film in the philosophical realm, even more so than the original. There is a richness and texture to everything that takes place against the backdrop of China. It has an even more ""fish out of water"" feel that lends to the believability and desperation of Smith's character. We also have a lot more character building time spent in this film that gives it about 13 more minutes run time than the original, but those extra moments really pay off in a big way. As I mentioned previously, we get more of Dre and his mom. They don't just show up and then she gets thrown into a few scenes like in the original. She is an important part of Dre's life and it is shown. The one thing I noticed the most about this film was the amount of families that attended it. I think it is the first film of the year where adults and kids can go and enjoy a film together and both come out with the same emotions and lessons learned. That would be a reflection of the film itself as it shows Mr Han learning from his student, something that gives the film a welcome twist when compared to the original.Those that have pre-judged this film or gotten caught up in the name game really need to see the film before they make any judgments. This film is a VERY welcome surprise and more than holds it own against the original. It stays loyal to the lessons and relationships of the original film and brings them forward 25 years later.",The Karate Kid
98,evans-j34,As good as the original,7,7 November 2021,"This film deserves higher than a 6. I am a 80s child so love everything back then and hate remakes of bk then classics however in this exception the remake is just as good but for different reasons. Obviously the original has the 80s style vibe and nostalgia I miss & was acted well with good soundtrack and the teenage boy girl story, though as I grew I could never really see Mr miagi though funny as all that tough. The remake has a slightly darker tone the kids are younger making your empathy for Dre ( the karate kid ) much stronger, I tend to find im more emotional over this than the original, the choreography is brilliant yes there's some cgi but its not over used. All the child actors are amazing and very talented, and probably been through a lot more gruelling training than in the 80s. This is a good remake that can be watched more than once.",The Karate Kid

In Shotokan Karate the belief the shortest distance between two points is a straight line. In Okinawan Shuri-Ryu is more adaptive. If your opponent attacks straight on you attack at an angle. If they hold their ground you circle. What got me was you take a white belt student and turn them into a black belt overnight.

100,jonnyfendi,Ingenious Combination,7,13 June 2010,"For me, thiz is the best Jackie Chan's acting of all-time, especially in Hollywood movies. Regularly, he always performed comical part into his characters. But in thiz movie, he has shown the other side of his acting, which he successfully delivers a deep and serious character. I think Jackie also realize (since ""Shinjuku Incident"" {2009}) that he is not young anymore and sooner or later he will not be able to depend on his martial arts again, he will turn 56 years old thiz year. Yes, it's still using the same formula like the other ""Karate Kid"" movies (1984-1994). Only thiz time, the Cast members are jaw-dropping. Will Smith's son Jaden Smith becomes the disciple named Dre and Jackie Chan as his master. It's an ingenious combination. Beside that, we have an exotic and wonderful environment that sets in China. They keep the famous title line ""The Karate Kid"" but actually it's all about Kung Fu. I will never understand why most of the critics underestimate thiz movie. What I observe, everything has already maximized. The plot is still the same, but the atmosphere is totally renew and absolutely refreshing. The movie is not just filled with great action sequences but also thoughtful life philosophies inside. ""Life will knock us down, but we can choose to get back up"" is definitely will be one of the memorable quotes. Every time I look at Jaden Smith's best performance, I will be amazed by how his attitude and body language looks similar to his father in most moments. The scene stealers are two Chinese kids around Dre's character. First one is a girl who becomes Dre's lovely friend, Meiying (Wenwen Han) and Cheng (Zhenwei Wang) who becomes Dre's furious foe. The man behind thiz remake is the Dutch Director, Harald Zwart. He is a perfect choice for family movie like thiz, just what he has shown in his previous directing credits such as ""Agent Cody Banks"" (2003) and ""The Pink Panther 2"" (2009). Every scene, every character and every action is fantastic. It will not make you bored at all, because ""everything is Kung Fu!""

101,JamesRutland,Better than its title,9,17 February 2015,"I've seen casually this movie, and I was positively surprised. What's wrong in this movie: the title. Karate kid in China? Gung fu confused with Karate? Reason why title is fundamental to understand how much it generates false impressions: user waits for Karate kid, but this movie is not karate kid... and fundamentally it's better than karate kid is about description of human situations of a kid and his family (mummy) disoriented in China because of job transfer. Human reactions are very natural and genuine, although some extravagant idea on the temple travel but without exaggerations... this movie preserves its spontaneous human relationship until the end. Conclusion is the classic American emphasis where the hero beats all ""bad villains""; until this moment relationship between mother and son is well developed, but in this specific circumstance it becomes unnatural: son has a broken leg but his mother exults (what about previous apprehension!?). OK the movie is good: good plot, good recitation, good situation, good psychology,... but TITLE is very mystifying: big marketing mistake (they have evoked false audience expectation to people).",The Karate Kid
102,T-ZER0,A Mixed Bag,4,31 December 2019,"Unfortunately for me, I saw this ""Karate Kid"" movie before I saw the original masterpiece. After seeing the originals and seeing this one again. I'm in a loop. I know I saw this one first, and Jackie Chan is an excellent casting choice. But I don't like that the movie is a contradiction. What I mean is, it says ""Karate Kid"" but they don't do Karate. They do Kung Fu. I know in China it's called the Kung Fu Dream, but still, that title is irking.We have an evil karate master, sorry ""Kung fu"" master whose supposed to be like John Kreese. (But is nothing like the classic villain). He teaches a bully who instantly takes a disliking to Dre, Jaden Smith's character. By the way Taraji P. Henson does great in this. I'm a fan of hers, and she does fine with this role.Oddly also, they copied elements from KKII. The Love Story for instance is a mixture of Daniel and Ali and Daniel and Kumiko. I also have to get this out. I am uncomfortable with Will Smith and Jada Pinkett Smith's name on anything from the Karate Kid franchise. I know they helped with Cobra Kai, and that show is still great. But when I think of Will Smith doing anything related to Karate Kid. I think of him turning it into Fresh Prince of Bel-Air, a good show, but it shouldn't be mixed with Karate Kid.I own this movie on blu-ray from Amazon, because I got it cheap. I haven't unwrapped it yet, because I'm not sure if I can watch it again. I mean, I'd watch it over ""The Next Karate Kid"". But still, mixed feelings here. I will however watch Karate Kid I-III and Cobra Kai. Those are awesome.",The Karate Kid
103,moviemattb,Very well done remake,9,21 November 2014,"As far as remakes go, this one stands out really well on its own while staying true to the original 1984 movie with Ralph Macchio and Pat Morita. ""The Karate Kid"" tells the same story about a boy moving out of his original home Detroit, Michigan to Beijing, China. As he and his mother moved in, our main hero makes friends with a beautiful girl while a bully stands in his way by beating him up in a violent way. Moreover, a man in his 50s comes into the boy's life as he trains him how to fight. If I had to admit, I wasn't really sure about this movie getting a remake and do not think it would turned out that good. So, I watched it and really love it. I was completely satisfied that this movie tries to be as different as possible, while, once again, staying true to the original movie. I am glad its not a shot for shot like the ""Psycho"" remake, which thanks goodness for that. I am not against remakes, but when you are remaking a movie that is already been made, then you have to ask yourself why. Why remake it when it is already a classic? But, what this movie did really does work on its own level rather than being one hundred percent carbon-copy. In the meantime, Hollywood needs to remake the bad ones, not the good ones. So, with that said, I thought the story for this remake is really well told as well as the characters. Jaden Smith and Jackie Chan both played each other very well on their own than just trying to be either Daniel LaRusso or Mr. Miyagi. Those roles I mention really belong to the original cast because they own these roles, but for Smith as Dre Parker works well to be playing his own character as well as Chan for playing Mr. Han. Also, I really do love the young actress Wenwen Han as Meiying for playing the hero's love interest, and thought she and Smith's character both have a chemistry really well together. Like Chan and Smith, she does her very best to not be like what Elisabeth Shue did in the original. I thought the film's cinematography is beautifully well shot, especially for being filmed in China. James Horner's music is also well-scored too. It is no Bill Conti, but I give it a pass. Harald Zwart really does a fine job on directing this movie. Any issues? Yes. The title of the movie is misleading because the movie dwells more on Kung-Fu than Karate; this should have been called ""The Kung-Fu Kid."" But, no, they just had to cash things in by carrying the name that has already been titled ""The Karate Kid,"" which is just for marketing purposes. It would have made sense if this was called ""The Kung-Fu Kid,"" and just put a description that would say: ""This film is based on the original 1984 film 'The Karate Kid' written by Robert Mark Kamen; directed by John G. Avildsen etc."" That is my only main issue that I have with the movie. Despite the title, I really enjoy this movie, and glad that it stands out on its own. A very well done remake. I give it a 9 out of 10.",The Karate Kid
104,loufalce,No More Remakes! {Reboots},1,8 June 2010,"Hot summertime and the remakes are lousy. Ineviatable remake of a fairly decent 80s film offers us nothing new asides from the fact that the kid is now African American and living in China after his single mother's job got her transfered there. He still gets beat up on by the school bullies and meets a girl {who seems to be a few years older than him} and, of course gets his karate training by a handyman {Chan} who is also a master in the martial arts. All the incidents are the same, except this time it is more kung fu than karate. Chan, in the role of the master is fairly decent and likable, but his limited acting range shows. Jaden Smith {Will Smiths son} also shows a little promise, but he was way better in ""The Pursuit of Happiness where he showed some genuine emotion while acting with his father. The usual clichés are there. The training sequences, the ""Rocky"" like scenes at the high staircase and the Great Wall of China with the swelling music and a protracted overlong tournament where you know exactly what the outcome will be. At least in the original, Pat Morita showed that he can act and the film did have some genuine emotion which this version sadly lacks. The kids or very undemanding viewers will probably enjoy it, but it is definitely not for adults or anybody who, like me wonders whatever happened to creativity and originality in Hollywood. Personally, I'm sick and tired of remakes {now called reboots} of good films. Even worse is having to fork over almost ten dollars{in the Obama economy} to see one at some faceless multiplex. Leave well enough alone! I'm sure there will be a sequel, so prepare yourself now.Needless to say, they'll probably milk it to death . Aother PU movie review from Lou.",The Karate Kid

107,bdgill12,Spitting in the face of the original,3,13 July 2011,"When his mother is transferred to China, Dre Parker (Jaden Smith) finds himself in a strange place with no friends and no sense of belonging. When he befriends a girl at his school (Wenwen Han), he draws the ire of a group of bullies who train at a disreputable kung fu studio. Things begin to change, however, when he meets and begins to train with Mr. Han (Jackie Chan), the building's maintenance man. Soon he enrolls in a kung fu tournament, setting up the inevitable confrontation between himself and his tormentors.First, the very brief positives. ""Karate Kid"" has solid action and some pretty cool fight scenes. Jackie Chan gives an admirable and quite believable performance as the pseudo Mr. Miyagi. In some ways this might be the perfect role for Chan as it combines his likability in an element he is comfortable in without exposing and/or exasperating his numerous flaws as an actor. And there are a few humorous lines (emphasis on the ""few"").Now, the negative. I've got a lot of problems with this thing but I'm going to keep it to three short points.1. ""The Karate Kid"" is not about karate; it's about kung fu. On numerous occasions the characters make references to Dre learning kung fu and yet it never seemed to dawn on anyone involved in the filmmaking process that maybe a movie called ""The Karate Kid"" should be about karate. Call me crazy but doesn't that kind-of-sort-of make sense? 2. Jaden Smith and the rest of the kiddie cast are WAY too young for this film. Dre is a 12 year old played by a kid who looks like an 8 year old but operating in situations that are suited for a 14 or 15 year old. News flash, Hollywood: no one wants to see 12 year olds kissing. It's weird and creepy and terribly off-putting. And it's not just the awkward romance. There's extensive training that no pre-adolescent could handle, some ""witty"" repartee that doesn't land, and at one point Jackie Chan puts a beat down on a group of 11 year olds. There's something wrong with that, isn't there? All told, it comes across as if Will Smith (whom I love, but still...) bought a script and cast his son regardless of whether it was a good fit or not.3. This is just BARELY a remake. Remakes are always a risky proposition because if you get too close to the original thing it feels unnecessary and if you stray too far away from a beloved inspiration, people feel it's an insult to the original. ""Karate Kid"" takes a bit from the original and adds some new elements but the mix just isn't right. Ultimately it comes off as a cheesy parody of a classic film that is treasured by most Americans born between 1975 and 1990. ""Jacket on, jacket off"" is embarrassingly feeble compared to ""Wax on, wax off"" and Dre Parker would crumble at the hands of Daniel Son. What I mean to say is, this feels like someone wrote a script and someone else thought, ""If we titled this ""The Karate Kid"" and made some vague references to the original, we could make a ton of cash off this thing!"" And that's exactly what happened.When you put all of that together, you get a below average film that fails to inspire. Not a terrible experience but certainly not the enjoyable trip down memory lane I was hoping for.",The Karate Kid
108,byson5186,Great Motivational Movie,10,18 September 2014,"I've seen this film get negative reviews, but I love it and I'll explain why I think it's a great film. This movie is over 2 hours long, and I feel like most long films aren't completely enjoyable, as most of them have slow unnecessary scenes. But, I think of this movie as entertaining from start to finish. For one, people will notice a lot of similar scenes in this film and the original Karate Kid and a lot of people who are fans of the original Karate Kid are upset with this movie being made as a remake. But, here's what makes it great. Well, the movie is a motivational movie. Whenever I watch it, this movie makes me want to work out and push myself hard as we see Dre Parker/Jaden Smith working out hard and becoming the incredible person he becomes in the movie. We also see real fighting action and true Kung Fu. Yeah, motivational movies are empowering. This movie also has great music. What also is really good about this movie, well it's filmed in China so we get to see Chinese culture throughout the film. We also see a kids reaction to moving from the United States to China. The movie also shows characters that seem relatable, it not only just shows Dre training with Mr. Han for Kung Fu, but making friends with a girl, Meiying. We see Meiying do typical activities like practicing violin for a concert. In all, I'd recommend this Karate Kid movie to you if you haven't seen it. I frequently watch it if I want a movie night and am looking for a good movie to watch. If you want to watch an entertaining movie that shows Chinese culture, this is the one. If you want to watch a fun motivational movie then this is the one to watch. Overall, I give this movie a 10/10 and am waiting for a sequel as I heard a sequel was in the works, but it looks like it isn't being made yet. Are they going to make it?

Of course this rendition has been jazzed up some and now a Detroit mom and her son find themselves in China.The storyline is unique, albeit implausible. A 12-year old American kid finds himself in the middle of schoolyard bullying and a budding romance. But his taunters are highly skilled Kung Fu students. As the story evolves, so we learn that the peppy kid must team up with his new mentor in Chan. Together they go through a process of healing, learning and training.There's no wax on, wax off although viewers will quickly see parallels, but there is the famous fly and chopstick scene - with a comedic twist. The movie starts off very slowly and Jaden is for the most part out of his depth in this role. He is overwhelmed by a story that requires considerably more talent and insight.But it's Jackie Chan who carries this story to its gripping conclusion. And the final kick of the contest is certainly worth the film's exaggerated running time.",The Karate Kid
110,darin-wissbaum,Worn out formula that needs to be put to rest...,2,14 October 2010,"OK I think Hollywood has made its point with this Karate Kid nonsense. This is a worn out formula that has outlived its usefulness. First we had the The Karate Kid, then The Karate Kid Part II, then the Karate Kid Part III and just when we thought it was over they gave us The Next Karate Kid which of course had to star a woman. If you remember anything from the very first movie back in 1984 you will notice that the premise of this latest release is almost identical to that one. In both films you had a single mother who takes a job in another state, or in this case in another country, is a single parent raising a son who does not seem to be adjusting to the relocation all that well, and finds himself bullied by some punk that knows karate. After he gets his butt kicked he meets the Master (which in the earlier films was played by the late Pat Morita) Jackie Chan who does his best to play a dramatic role with no success takes the young lad under his wing and teaches him the art of Kung Fu. Will Dre Parker played by Jaden Smith learn Kung Fu in a hurry? Will there be a big fight at the end? Will he win? Will the master almost become a father to him? Does the sun rise in the East every day? This film is not in any way an original idea and just proves that Hollywood has run clean out of them. I can only wonder how many sequels this film will spawn. Save your hard earned money",The Karate Kid

This is a very cool movie for all the family. Jaden Smith is super cool and the film is super entertaining. We are huge fans of the original Karate Kid, and this remake is really cool, fresh and fun. My kids love it. We have watched it like 10 times. The worst: This film should be called The Kung Fu Kid, because it's about Kung Fu, not Karate. The best: All the rest: Jaden Smith, the tournament, the story, Jackie Chan, the girl, the violin piece. Watch it, cheer up and enjoy!",The Karate Kid
112,kevinmorice,Truly awful,3,29 December 2010,"Spoilers included.Why does this kid keep getting cast? He is truly awful in everything he has ever been in and surely even the box-office power of his father's name and the movie title can't be making his casting a financially sound decision for the studios.You aren't given any reason to care about the central character. From the start he is an obnoxious little show-off and deserves the initial beating that he gets. He doesn't develop as a character or change into anyone that you might actually want to identify with. None of the other characters are developed either, they might as well be mobile scenery. The story starts weakly; you are never even told why they are moving to China and it just goes downhill from there to a conclusion that you already knew but which is exaggerated even further than the original. Finishing off the movie by including a 12-year-old performing a one-legged back-flip with a twist that any Olympic gymnast would be proud of is fitting of how thoughtless the rest of the movie is.Add to that the overuse of wire-work and slow-mo and the removal of any of the character development or scene-setting of the original and you are left with a truly awful remake.Stick with the original. It may have dated a little but it is in a whole different league from this drab clone. Only gets 3 stars and they are all for Jackie Chan. Does his best to fill Pat Morita's role but is let down by a poor script and no support or chemistry from the rest of the cast.",The Karate Kid
113,pazu7,Neither as good or as bad as many say (lite spoilers),6,15 June 2010,"I am only writing this critique because this film seems to have provoked a lot of highly polarized reviews. I don't see any reason why it should. If you haven't seen this remake yet, I think you can just disregard the majority of these reviews, positive or negative, because it is neither as good or as bad as most claim.Karate Kid 2010 seems to have spawned a groups of haters that seem to be comprised of devotees of the original. Some of their responses seem little irrational to me. As good as the original was, is it nothing to be religious about. But some of the positive reviews are a bit exaggerated too, IMO.The remake is fun... and that's pretty much it. The kids will like it. Nice fight choreography, though somewhat frantically filmed. But in the end, it's just another remake and unfortunately, as is usually the case, it is no improvement on the original. I would even assert the original was better. Or let's say if I was suggesting which to watch I'd say watch the first for good movie making, storytelling, acting... and the second if you're mainly going for the fight choreography.Chan is good in the updated Morita role. His first real dramatic role and he pulled it off fine. But he didn't come anywhere near Morita's performance. And they changed his back story in a manner that removes any kind of social depth. Don't want to spoil that but let's just say that it's a bland revision and, while wonderfully portrayed by Chan and Jaden, the realization scene never moves beyond being a simple plot point.While Chan and Jaden do great jobs (it's not fair to compare Jaden to Macchio, who was already in his 20's when he did Karate Kid) the chemistry between the two protags doesn't have the strength of the original. But I blame the writing for this, not the performers. I think they were up to it but the script was a little plastic. Well, more than a little.Maybe I am being unfair. This is a different film after all. It does go father than the original in some places, and it is arguably better in those case. The mother plays more of an integral role. But outside of being amusing, her additional scenes really don't bring anything to the story. Her presence actually seems to detract from some of the moments between Chan and Jared. Maybe Smith just didn't want her to come off as a negligent mother? Another problem with the remake is the metronomic pacing that comes from a script that's been doctored to maximize scene economy. Everything flows quickly from one plot point to another. While considered good writing in some circles, this pacing blunts the dynamic peaks of the film. And they introduced the bullying too soon. As if they had to get to it quick unless people get bored.And the score is overdone, as if the filmmakers were trying to force some emotion into the scenes. Horner's score is fine, appropriate to the scenes as usual. But you can't fix a bland moment by turning up the music.And while I love Jackie Chan's choreography style, here it is a bit much. By overdoing the kung fu in his typical style, with sound effects and kicks and punches that would break bones in real life, it ruins one of the essential plot points of the original: Macchio's character could never had beat his opponent in a real fight. He won on points. In this version the competition scenes are so overdone (nobody does full on contact like that without protection, especially with kids) that by the time young Jaden (who BTW is a great little martial artist and great fun to watch) faces off with the bad guy it's not really conceivable that he could pull off his tricks. One minute the antagonist is doing amazing light speed stunts, the next he is getting knocked over by Jaden's simple sweeps.But I am not a hater. We had a good time. Take the kids. It's a fun film. It's just not as good or bad as everyone makes out.",The Karate Kid

So, I didn't really have the image of the whole film. The movie was actually pretty good. It's paced perfectly and it's nice to watch. The story's like a very long journey of a young boy reaching immortal victory. The movie was really good and the action scenes were also satisfying enough. Then, humors are added to the movie to add some comedy in the film. I also praise the talents of the new star: Jaden Smith. His acting was good and he really is a rising star.The film is a good mixture of many emotional elements. It has quite sad moments and exciting moments. I like the mixture of the emotions and they're perfectly put. The movie also has a courageous theme. This movie in all is a good film. It's worth to watch for you people. I really enjoyed the movie and I think this movie is good for you to watch.",The Karate Kid
115,the_rattlesnake25,Surprisingly good remake of the 1984 cult classic...,7,15 July 2010,"In today's Cinematic world of constant lifeless reimagining's and underachieving sequels, it is refreshing to see for once, a well-made, proficient remake which still manages to restrain the positive values and engaging nature of the original. Harald Zwart's 'The Karate Kid' brings the original film into the twenty-first century by using one the most recognised contemporary Asian actors of the last thirty years, and a rising star who is currently heavily overshadowed by his father, and allowing them both to flourish in a respectable and worthy remake. While the only substantial and somewhat controversial difference between the two films is the fact that despite being named 'The Karate Kid' in the majority of Western countries, the location of the film and the actual martial art displayed both descend from Chinese culture, unlike the martial art of Karate which is a descendant of Japanese culture. Yet, it must be noted that this 'cultural controversy' does not detract away from the true nature of the film.Xiao (Little) Dre Parker (Jaden Smith) and his mother Sherry (Taraji Henson) decide to get away from things in Detroit and start a new life, with a new culture, in Beijing, China. Once they land in the Middle Kingdom, Dre attempts to settle in by making friends with the local children, and while there he notices the young violinist Mei Ying (Wenwen Han). But his hormones fluttering is not his only problem, as the local bully Cheng (Zhenwei Wang) notices his affection for Mei Ying and humiliates Dre by using his superior Kung Fu skills to hurt the young boy. After he undertakes various beatings, Dre is eventually helped by the mysterious maintenance man of his building in Mr Han (Jackie Chan), who demonstrates his superior Kung Fu skills to a mesmerized Dre. After this, the film's plot almost mimics the original 1984 'Karate Kid' film to the tee with both man and boy becoming ever closer in the three months Dre has to train before he battles the sadistic bully Cheng at an upcoming Kung Fu tournament.While on the surface, the film concentrates upon the use of martial arts to contain, and defeat those who attempt to bully and hurt Dre, its underlying theme is of perseverance as both Dre and Han must fight through the past to create their own futures. Dre is young boy in a foreign land, unable to understand, or become truly part of society, while Han is tormented by the mistakes of his past, however through their father-son surrogate relationship; both are able to battle their inner demons head-on. And it is the actors performances which bring this motion picture truly too life. Jaden Smith and Jackie Chan take centre stage in this remake, and both deliver fantastic performances, especially Chan, who portrays the traumatised maintenance man who is scarred beneath the surface, perfectly. While despite a strong act from young Jaden, he is slightly hampered by the fact that his character is only twelve-years old, rendering the majority of the pre-puberty romantic scenes between himself and Mei Ying meaningless despite their emotive beauty.Alongside the acting, the cinematography of the film at times borders on breathtaking as director Harald Zwart, Editor Joel Negron and Cinematographer Roger Pratt take their time to appreciate the splendour of the Chinese landscape and communicate this cultural veracity to the audience. The sequences filmed on the Wudang Mountain exemplify this beauty as the frame is constantly filled with sights and sounds, no doubt foreign to the Western audience watching, as the camera casually glides above to capture the scenery. This beauty is however lost in the last twenty minutes of the film as it moves forth into the tournament stage, the soft, classical music is exchanged for exuberant rock and roll and the editing mirrors that of a American music video; a noticeable blip, on an almost magnificently shot film.What constantly drives the film forward, aside from its technical aspects, is the fact that the Sensei/Mentor (Father/Son) relationship between Dre and Mr Han works so perfectly. The scenes they share together will make you laugh, cry, smile, frown, and ultimately feel all warm and fuzzy inside, while the scenes of eye-opening martial arts provides an element of excitement to somewhat balance out the dramatic nature of the film. Whether you enjoyed the original 'Karate Kid' film or not, I would still recommend this film to audiences of all ages who appreciate more than heavy explosions and repetitive action sequences.",The Karate Kid
116,jakerocks,Kung fu vs Karate,6,5 June 2021,If they had called it The Kung Fu Kid there never would have been any controversy. Jaden Smith didn't deserve the mistreatment he received for what was billed as a remake of the Karate Kid. It's a heartwarming coming-of-age story. Jackie Chan is great. If you like his movies this is familiar territory.,The Karate Kid
117,EchoMaRinE,thanks for ruining yet one more good old memory,6,5 August 2010,"I must say there is no way this remake can be compared with the original karate kid although the story line is almost same. What fails so hard in this one is basically the acting. I am sorry but Jaden Smith's performance was just terrible. Compared to The Pursuit of Happiness, he seems to lost some acting abilities. Also, in the original karate, the story was based on a teenage boy who falls in love with a teenage girl. In this remake, the story is based on kids and I certainly didn't find a love story between kids attractive. The last tournament was rushed. The mother was acting terrible. Jackie Chan' performance was not shining either. Overall, I could watch it till the end but it is just a bad remake of a masterpiece.",The Karate Kid
118,princessstrickland21,Not as bad as you think,6,5 January 2019,"Sure. The original will always be considered the best, and most memorable, but this one, give a chance.Jaden isn't the best as Ralph Machio, but he's still an ok actor. The story is rough in some parts as well as some of the acting is a little weak, but if Jackie Chan wasn't in it, it would have failed.
BTW: They study kung-fu not karate. And they got the villains mixed up.In the original the karate teacher is bat s**t in insane, and the bully is just somewhat bland.
Its switched around in this one. Kid bats**t insane, the teacher bland.I gave this a chance and I actually liked it. So 6 out of 10. Thanks jackie chan",The Karate Kid

Although they are studying lung fu, but it feels true to the original. The acting might be ok with some rules, but Jackie Chan is amazing.He can actually do drama as well as being an amazing wise tutor.Is it better than the original, well no but it does put a decent story together. And it is a little longer, so I'd say...give it a chance, you won't be disappointed.",The Karate Kid
120,Legendary_Badass,The Karate Kid reaches rarefied status as a successful remake,8,11 June 2010,"In the 2010 version of The Karate Kid, Jaden Smith plays the role of 12-year-old Dre Parker. Dre and his mother (Taraji P. Henson) have moved from Detroit to Beijing. On his first day in China, Dre walks over to the neighborhood park and sees a young aspiring violinist. A brief chat with her lands Dre is hot water with Cheng (Zhenwei Wang), the school bully. Fortunate for Dre, his building's repairman happens to be Mr. Han (Jackie Chan), a martial arts master. With Mr. Han's help Dre trains in kung fu so he can square off with the bullies at the upcoming fighting tournament.The synopsis sounds familiar, but changes are significant. The backdrop of Beijing isn't simply a change of location, Jackie Chan's Mr. Han isn't a carbon copy of Pat Morita's Mr. Miyagi, and the martial artistry has been ramped up to eleven. Even with predictability working against it, The Karate Kid offers plenty of surprises.Jaden is a charismatic young actor. His interjections of comedy and dancing are welcome additions. His interactions with Taraji P. Henson almost assure the audience that he's her son. It's also obvious that he's put a lot of time into kung fu training. Newcomers Wenwen Han and Zhenwei Wang play the love interest and nemesis roles, respectively; I'd welcome either back for another production.Clearly, the single biggest factor in this film is Jackie Chan. With Chan present, the fighting has to meet a certain standard, and it does. Kicks are fast and fluid, punches come in from all directions, and the aerial moves are jaw dropping. That is to be expected, but the real shocker is the performance Chan puts together. Not to give too much away, but Mr. Han's motivation is touching and real. I've seen maybe a dozen Jackie Chan films, and this is by a mile his best and most original performance.As much as Jaden proves himself, I can't help but think that he's wrong for the part. His character is 12, but he looks about 9. The themes he's tackling strike me as too mature for someone his age. For instance, the lead bully seems content with acquiring the choice female and dealing out serious damage to anyone who gets in his way. By anyone, I'm including adults. Though this puts into play a well-choreographed classic Jackie Chan showcase, a part of my mind is put off.The Karate Kid is directed by Harald Zwart, in a steep departure from his last offering, The Pink Panther 2. The cinematography is from the J.J. Abrams Star Trek school of occasional hand-held and plenty of lens flare. I have a feeling that producer, and star's daddy, Will Smith had a big hand in the high production values.Even with the early shock of seeing preteens duke it out, everything is eventually made believable. It's nice departure to see a PG movie in 2010 that doesn't underestimate the intelligence of children, even if the more appropriate title would have been The Kung Fu Kid (that's actually the international title). The Karate Kid reaches rarefied status as a successful remake.",The Karate Kid
121,Marc_Action,Smith Takes on Macchio,6,28 September 2012,"Jaden Smith did a good job acting, I'm impressed. Also good to see Jackie Chan in this film. While Jaden has the lead role, you know Chan can't be in a movie and not have a fight scene of his own. It's the best fight sequence of the movie to be honest, but his fights are always nicely choreographed.As for the movie itself, I give it a high score of 6 (and yes a 6 out of 10 is high given the my low expectations). As stated, Jaden did a very good job acting, and he's very charming. That pretty much sums up the movie. It's charming. But when I'm watching a martial arts movie, I don't want charming. In no way does this match the intensity of the original from 1984. While good, Jaden is no Danny LaRusso (Ralph Macchio) and Chan is no Mr. Miyagi (Pat Morita). The movie is also very slow and gets bogged down in a sea of meaningless melodrama leading up to the big tournament. The payoff is just not worth the long wait.I'm sort of glad they tried to be a little more original with the plot vs. the first Karate Kid, with having a black kid from Detroit moving to China vs. a white Italian kid moving from Jersey to southern Cali. But then a trip to Asia was already covered in Karate Kid II back in 1986 (they went to Okinawa, Japan though), so it's not exactly original. Also, I don't have a problem with the film featuring Kung Fu as the martial art of choice, but if you're going to do that, then have the balls to change the title accordingly.Taraji P. Henson also stars as Jaden's mom. It's worth a look but it's no classic.",The Karate Kid

However, as a remake, it may not deliver the same charm the original had anyway.What I like about the remake is that it has an interesting soundtrack, at least some of the important events that were included in the original are present in this movie, Dre at least does a good job at being the main protagonist, the plot is similar enough to the original, it teaches the audience a few things about the Chinese culture, the acting is great, the climax is still great, the character development is good and there are some good messages.However, its bad qualities include a lot of the scenes that made the original movie great were either removed or changed for the worse, Dre's mum can be very unlikeable at times, this movie is nearly completely unfaithful to the source material altogether, the plot is cliched and the relationships can feel a bit forced sometimes.Overall I find this movie to be mediocre but I have seen movies which are a lot worse than this.

I couldn't tell if Jaden and Jackie ever liked each other. (4) No suspense. It's hard to feel any kind of danger when the bad guys are just a bunch of 12-year-old kids and you've got a full-grown martial arts master on your side. (5) Jaden Smith. Did I already mention that?Overall this film was just plain boring. The fight scenes were, of course, better than in the original.

I think that it is a blasphemous insult to the original, which really should be watched again. There are notable life-lessons in the original, and they are paraphrased in the remake. The quote of ""wax on, wax off"" had meaning, and became embedded into pop-culture. As did the crane stance. This movie can be easily forgotten. Daniel learning the basic forms for blocking by washing cars, painting fences and sanding the floor makes a LOT more sense than Dre learning anything by taking his jacket off and picking it up off the floor any number of times. A constant repetitive motion done for hours is a lot more relevant than the infinite variations of the way one puts on and takes off a jacket.The idea that any new practitioner of kung-fu could defeat a black sash like that is ridiculous. Period. It takes years to earn a black sash, and that sifu (the bad instructor) did not seem the type to give sashes away unwarranted.Why use the name Karate Kid if the only reference to karate is that ""it's not karate.""? All in all, I thought it was a bad, over-promoted movie with a legendary name. I wonder how many people started karate lessons after they saw the original. Did you even consider studying kung-fu after seeing this?",The Karate Kid
126,MatthewLong23,Decent remake. Entertaining nonetheless,8,4 July 2010,"Karate Kid is the ultimate overcoming obstacles movies. The bullying scenes are often brutal to watch and often realistic in what is happening to the character Dre in the film. I did not like the whole story about the owner of the martial arts academy, having it out for Dre and Mr. Han just because he was defending himself against his students. I thought that was a stupid aspect of the film and completely unnecessary. The whole take the jacket off, put the jacket on does not have the same pizazz as wash on wash off but who knows it could take off as a popular saying. The scenes with Dre and Mr. Han training were entertaining and often fun to watch. I enjoyed the final martial arts tournament and the action scenes there. I thought it was stupid that the owner told his students to break Dre's legs and there seemed to be no repercussions of that. Overall a good movie though.",The Karate Kid

And in this case The Karate Kid 2010 remake crashed and burned. It was very disappointing. To be honest, going into the move I did lower my expectations – expecting it wouldn't be as good as the original Karate Kid. I'm sorry to say that even those lowered expectations weren't met.It was nice to see the film change it's setting to China. That made for an interesting adaptation and it fit well with the story. BUT there's a lot of fluff and irrelevant time (don't call it an attempt at character development because it failed), the characters didn't jell and little of the story was believable. The original Karate Kid was 2 hours and it flew by. This remake was only 16 minutes longer but it seemed like it was more than 3 hours. The ending was spectacular.Jackie Chan is excellent as always, but Jaden Smith is not quite ready for prime time, I'm sorry to say. It's admirable that his dad, Will Smith, is trying to help his son out. And Jaden did have a few modest flashes of good quality acting, but for the majority of the movie I just didn't find his character believable – including for a majority of the fight scenes during the tournament.Overall The Karate Kid 2010 remake is a major disappointment.

I have watched the original Karate kid movie and it's a solid movie i would recommend people watching.
I like this movie as well it has flaws i will address.CHARACTERS
The mother has no importance to the story Dre's ""girlfriend"" has no importance either to the story.
There is no conflict between Dre and those two characters which is the reason this movie is weak.
If they added conflict to those characters the movie would have been a 7/10 or even a 8/10.
Mr Han is eh, He is ok character they tried to give him more depth but they kinda failed at doing that cause there was this one scene where we get to know more about him but that scene barely has an importance to the story cause they never address that scene later on so Han is kinda bland.
Dre is fine no big problem with him but they could have added more depth to his character.FIGHTING
The fighting was good and i gotta give props that Jaiden actually took time to learn Kara.. I mean Kung fu.
But he should have taken acting classes as well.
The fighting was well choreographed and i liked it.VERDICT
Those where my only problems.
This movie lacked depth and they could have developed the characters more and there are stuff that i didn't talk about like the bullies and that bad teacher but that is because they had so little importance to the story they where basically irrelevant.",The Karate Kid
129,Sleeper-Cell,Someone needs to sweep Will Smith's leg.,1,20 October 2018,As a lover of the original film I was very disappointed in this terrible remake. There really isn't much to say.

130,brentn,They really can't make'em last like they used to.,5,24 February 2021,"Where to start? How bout the cons:1) The movie is called Karate Kid but lacks the Karate because it's Japanese and this takes place in China where they teach Kung Fu. They also emphasized several times that they were learning Kung Fu but that did not stop them. There is an alternate title called The Kung Fu Kid but they didn't use this in North America.2) The characters were dull and had no chemistry like the original did. There was no real feeling for any of them and all the relationships between them all felt flat and hollow. The villainous teacher (Master Li) and student/bully (Cheng) failed to create the oppressive atmosphere that Kreese and Lawrence had done with Cobra Kai. Kreese and Miyagi also shared many differences like race, faith, honour and even age which created much tension between them. This unfortunately was absent from this remake. Also the acting was quite poor in this newer version save for a couple of emotional scenes.3) This film was way too long. With a runtime of almost 2.5 hours, it was completely unnecessary and dragged me across what felt like a bridge of glass.The pros:1) The fact that the protagonist moves all the way to China kind of gave a good premise for being a true outsider and created a lot of new obstacles for the character.2) Jackie Chan was a create choice and made the learning a lot more entertaining and creative.3) The fight sequences were far more superior in this version. They were well choreographed and actually looked real and even painful in some parts.

The one thing holding this movie back was the fact that it was a copy of that pathetic summer b movie with Ralph Machio.This movie was far superior to the original Karate Kid. The fact that they copied that movie is why I rate it so low.I enjoyed watching this movie. The setting, in smog-choked Beijing, was very interesting, and I find Kung Fu much more interesting than Karate.Why Didn't They Call It ""The Kung Fu Kid""??? I will never know. Is it not cool in Hollywood to change the title when you are blatantly copying? Well, we know that is not true from all the blatant copying that goes on every day.Jackie Chan was fantastic, other than his silly 'jacket on' 'jacket off' technique. Note to non martial arts practicioners - THIS DOES NOT WORK. It is stupid and silly. Choosing a far more believable technique, such as making the kid polish his car-crash Scirrocco, would have been more believable.Finally, I was appalled at the violence at the end of the movie. China does not have full contact kung fu competitions with NO SAFETY equipment, not even for adults, never mind these kids beating each other senseless!!!

This is mainly for two reasons. 1. Ralph Macchio was never convincing and no one could really believe he could beat anyone. His so called Martial Arts skills were useless and looked even worse on screen. He looked like a scared little girl and it was obvious that any of his opponents would have whipped him easily. Jayden Smith is annoying throughout the film and I didn't like his cocky attitude, but he looks convincing enough to win his fights and contrary to what some others have said I do think he can act. The scenes with Jackie Chan near the end are particularly good, 2. Not to take away anything from the late Pat Morita who was a great Mr Miagi and the best thing about the original, but Jackie Chan makes this film. He is a 'real' martial artist and totally convincing. The only negative is we don't see enough of his skills, the one fight he is in is as amazing as ever. But we also get to see Jackie Chan the actor and what a great actor he really is. All the supporting cast are really good and the ending was much better than in the original. The young Chinese girl was perfect for the role and can clearly act. I was in fact convinced by all the supporting actors. Also the scenery of China is spectacular. So don't listen to the negative comments ( I am sure many who criticize it have not actually watched the film ) just see it yourself and enjoy.",The Karate Kid
134,KevinB12,"Okay movie, but very unpleasant",6,9 August 2010,"I know Jaden Smith does not like to go to China because that woman plays Sherri Parker had a job there. This is why Jaden Smith does not like China because he does not understand Cantonese or Mandarin. He only speaks English and not french or Spanish. What is most upsetting about the movie is that some bully beat the living daylights out of Jaden Smith because Jaden cannot fight back or learn how to defend himself by that bully who threatened his life. Maybe later in life if they made a sequel to the remake, Jaden Smith would graduate from a Chinese high school and go back to Detroit to go to college. Lucy Liu or Jennifer Garner would train Jaden Smith on how to build muscle and learn mixed martial arts. I think that would be a better sequel if they ever make one.",The Karate Kid
135,nuhc,Not as good as the original,5,7 March 2011,"This movie was passive entertainment, and while the setting is in China instead of southern California, they did stay pretty close to the original story line. You have a kid who is an outsider who just moved to a new town with his mom, and gets picked on by a bunch of bullies who happen to know martial arts. Kid makes friends with the maintenance man of his apartment building who agrees to teach him martial arts as well. Kid agrees to fight bully kids in a martial arts tournament even though their sensei tells them to cheat. I won't give away the predictable ending, but you get the idea.While I do admire remakes of movies that stay close to the original story line, I just didn't think this movie was nearly as good as the first one. It just didn't seem believable that after taking off his jacket and putting it on a peg for a few hundred times that a kid would be able to match moves with Jackie Chan. A little more intensive training would be needed. It was barely believable in the first movie, but was totally unbelievable in this one.And I don't think I really need to point out that the martial arts being practiced in this movie were not karate. They even said in the movie that it was Kung Fu.A watchable, decent movie, but go watch the original. Even if it's dated in the 80's, it's still better.",The Karate Kid
136,terrellrobinson71,"One of the best remakes of the year! And you don't need to wax on, wax off a lot.",10,11 June 2010,"It's hard to explain the remake of ""The Karate Kid"" since I just came from the movies to see it, but at least it's just like the original but this time, it's a little different. In this remake, poor Dre Parker (Jaden Smith, son of Will and Jada Pinkett Smith, who co-produced the film) moves from Detroit, Michigan to Beijing, China along with his mom, Sherry (Taraji P. Henson) who's got a promotion in this new country. He tries to fit in, especially finding a friend in a violinist named Meiyang (Han Wenwen), but his new life is in trouble when the bully, Cheng, is making his life hell. That is until, the Mr. Miyagi character or, in this case, Mr. Han (Jackie Chan) saves his life and teaching the ""real kung-fu"" and by putting him in an intense martial arts competition with the ""bad kung-fu"" kids along with Master Li (Rongguang Yu from ""Iron Monkey""), who is hellbent on making the kids fight other kids without stopping. (What is with the adrenaline thing?) No matter, I actually love this movie because of what made the original a icon and that is exactly what this movie is doing. It's great to see Jackie Chan in the Pat Morita role and he does it without making us prove that this is Jackie Chan and this calls for the best performance of a lifetime. But the movie's hero or heroes are using China as a backdrop of introducing us to a whole new international world, the 140-minute mark that made it work, the beautiful cinematography by Roger Pratt, the charming screenplay by Christopher Murphey and, of course, young Jaden Smith who shines in the Ralph Macchio role and that is a fact. When I saw the previews, I knew it would be something interesting. Now, I came in, excited, happy and joyful. I laughed, almost cried and cheered all the way into the finale. This is one of the best remakes I've ever seen and it's a better ""Karate Kid"" since ""The Next Karate Kid"". Bring your whole family to see this piece of wonderful summer family entertainment, especially kids ages 8 and up, and see how Jackie Chan and Jaden Smith will bring you a great time at the movies this summer.",The Karate Kid
137,enigmaticmaniac,Good One,6,3 July 2011,"Well I haven't seen the earlier version so this was new for me. It's always a pleasure to watch Jackie Chan although you can hardly see him in action in this movie as the lead character is Jaden Smith as Dre. Concept of the movie is not new as its already a remake but the direction is just average. Script is also lacking somewhere and the movie is a bit lengthy too. Still it connects fairly on emotional level. Some good dialogs are incorporated. The meaning of Kung-Fu is correctly portrayed in the movie. Its unfair to judge Jackie Chan and Jaden Smith has done a good act. The movie on whole is enjoyable. Its not bad and its not great, so definitely it can be watched once.",The Karate Kid
138,TheUnseenMovieLover,"An Unnecessary, But Surprisingly Impressive Remake",8,26 July 2010,"Twelve-year-old Dre Parker (Jaden Smith, son of Will) moves from Detroit to China with his mother, Sherry (Taraji P. Henson). Whilst striking up a friendship with a Chinese girl named Meiying (Wenwen Han), Dre attracts the wrath of a group of bullies, led by Cheng (Zhenwai Wang). Cheng and his gang are well trained in kung fu, and make mincemeat out of Dre. During one confrontation, Dre is saved by his building's maintenance man, Mr. Han (Jackie Chan). Revealing his intimate knowledge of kung fu, Han promises to train Dre so that he can face the bullies in an upcoming tournament. Though Mr. Han's methods at first appear to be unorthodox, his teachings soon begin to have an impact on Dre, and the two form a close bond.The original Karate Kid is a blast of pure 80's nostalgia; the time and place in the original are keenly felt. The performances (especially Pat Morita's iconic turn as Mr. Miyagi), direction and cinematography are all strong, and the movie has a lot of charm and heart. Whilst The Karate Kid isn't a perfect movie, it's a movie that I just can't help but love.What surprised and pleased me about this remake was how faithful it remains to the overall spirit of the original, and how it is so much more than the generic studio product that a lot of people, including myself, were fearing. My heart dropped when I found out that Harald Zwart, director of the Agent Cody Banks movies and The Pink Panther 2, was at the helm. Surprisingly, Zwart does a strong job of directing here, deftly avoiding the idiocy of his previous movies to craft a Karate Kid that will not only satisfy fans of the original, but will also prove to be thoroughly entertaining for those who haven't seen the original. This is a charming, funny, exciting, and, in some moments, genuinely emotional movie.The performances are solid across the board. Based on the evidence of his performance here, Jaden Smith looks likely to be just as big a star as his dad. There is nothing exceptional about Smith's performance here; the material doesn't really stretch his dramatic abilities too much. But he anchors the film with his energy and likability. This is to Jaden what Fresh Prince of Bel-Air was to Will; a chance to take centre stage and show his star potential, which there is a lot of. Taraji P. Henson excels in her underwritten role as Dre's mother, bringing honest emotion and life to a character who, over the course of the movie, we don't learn all that much about. Her scenes with Smith fully convince as a mother- son dynamic. Zhenwai Wang is about as nasty and despicable as a child actor has been for some time as Dre's main nemesis, whilst Wenwen Han brings warmth and grace to the stock role of romantic interest. Also making a deep impression with limited screen time is Rongguang Yu as Master Li, the vicious kung fu master and the teacher of Dre's bullies. Come the final fight, Yu becomes the character most likely to make the audience want to punch something. Whilst Cheng is brutal, he is a child. Li is an adult, and has greater knowledge of his actions; this makes the lengths to which he will go to to get what he wants all the more frightening and evil.Despite Smith's prominent billing, this is Chan's movie. From his first appearance, you can just tell that this is going to be one of hiss better performances. By the end, I was convinced that was Chan's best performance. As Mr. Han, Chan has wonderfully sly charm. His facial expressions and body language alone are enough to provoke big laughs in some scenes. His martial arts fans are also unlikely to be disappointed by his terrific main fight sequence, in which he skilfully takes down Dre's bullies. The scene even ends with a cheeky nod to Chan's age; after demolishing the kids, Chan turns to the camera and wheezes slightly. But what really makes this a brilliant performance is the underlying emotional power of Han's character. When Han's tragic past comes to the fore in one late scene, it is unexpectedly devastating, and, without doubt, is the best dramatic work that Chan has ever done. The chemistry between Chan and Smith is also wonderful, both actors appearing effortless in each other's presence.Otherwise, The Karate Kid has a lot going for it. The cinematography by Roger Pratt is beautiful, to the point where you literally want to get on the next flight to China. The fight scenes are brutally satisfying. Dre's first confrontation with Cheng had the audience wincing, whilst Chan's main fight alone is worth the price of a ticket. The finale is the most entertaining in terms of action, with several excellent fights. The choreography emphasises not only the skill, but the traits of the characters, which I really appreciated. The score by James Horner, whilst not especially memorable when the movie ends, really draws you in whilst the film is playing.There are flaws. At a running time of 2 hours and 20 minutes, the film goes on for too long. There are several scenes which could be cut. There are too many scenes of Dre being bullied, to the point where it seems like brutality for brutality's sake. Finally, there are too many sweeping, grand shots of China. You wonder whether the filmmakers are trying to make a deliberately epic movie.Apart from that, The Karate Kid is an immensely satisfying, entertaining remake which, if not surpassing the original, still makes you want to stand up and cheer by the end. Whilst it's nowhere near the high quality of masterpieces such as Toy Story 3 and Inception, it matches and often surpasses all other big offerings so far this summer.",The Karate Kid

No, it's Kung Fu, but the movie entertains, does his job right and could be compared to at least Karate III and IV for entertainment values.Should not be included in the series, but I dare say it's a fine addition to Jackie Chan's hundreds of movies and perhaps Jadens Smith's best role in his career.",The Karate Kid
141,YourFamilyExpert,Far better than it had any right to be,8,17 January 2017,"As others have noted, this remake should actually be called The Kung-Fu Kid, as it revolves around the Chinese, not Japanese, martial art. I'm not sure what's more troubling: the implication that American audiences wouldn't respond to anything less than a brand name or the fact that it's true. Regardless, a film nobody asked for, or expected much from, surprised audiences with its quality, proving itself to be one of the best live-action family films of the past decade.Jaden Smith (son of Will and Jada Pinkett Smith and subject of his father's hit song Just the Two of Us) continues to build on the impressive acting chops he displayed in The Pursuit of Happiness. Jackie Chan, who has long been one of my favorite action stars (based on his Hong Kong films, not his American ones) makes good on his stated intention to reinvent himself as a dramatic actor, showing a range of emotions (subtlety, warmth, and grief) that is truly impressive. There's a great deal of thought in the storytelling, as well as a complexity to the characters, that is missing from many family films today. The cinematography captures the lush beauty of China and messages about inter-cultural appreciation, self-discipline, and the abhorrence of misused violence, are well conveyed.The film's weaknesses are far from fatal. Its two and a half hour running time causes it to drag ever so slightly (it could've lost 10-15 minutes for a better pace). Also, after spending an entire film distinguishing itself from the 1980's classic and standing as its own film, this new Karate Kid (SPOILER) stumbles slightly by essentially copying and pasting the ending from the original. This may be fine for those who've never seen the older movie, and for those who have it is still thrilling and the well-delivered, with terrific choreography. I just wish the film had continued with its own independence. That said, it's still a poignant, moving, and thrilling surprise.IS IT OKAY FOR YOUR KIDS? The Karate Kid is rated PG. One of the key messages of the film is that of nonviolence. This should be surprising only to those who don't know much about actual martial arts, which teach mental and physical self-discipline, being in harmony with nature and other people, appreciation of life, respect for others, and use of force only out of defense. In order to convey this message, the film contrasts it with violent bullying and the misuse of force. There is child-on-child (and one instance of adult-on-child) violence in this film which serves the purpose of deflating the ""fighting is cool"" notion some audience members may have. It is gritty and painful to watch, making the film not recommended for very young children who may either be frightened by it or attempt to imitate it. For older children, however, the message of nonviolence should be clear. There are a couple of uses of mild profanity by a child, but these are corrected by his teacher and explained to be disrespectful, so the child doesn't use them anymore. A 12-year old boy and girl share a kiss.ANY WORTHWHILE MESSAGES? Physical force should be used only in self-defense, never to attack and only with the goal of making peace with one's enemies, not punishing them. Respect and honor your parents.",The Karate Kid
142,doctardis,Who knew Jackie Chan could act?,9,13 June 2010,"I suppose the original Karate kid proved to audiences that Pat Morita could do something other than comedy. In this new Karate Kid, Jackie Chan proves he can be a serious actor. The smiling jovial marshal arts master type that made Jackie Chan a star is not in this movie at all. Yes, he does fight, and yes, he does not disappoint. What you never have seen before is Jackie Chan playing a tortured down and out character. And surprisingly he pulls it off brilliantly. Jaden Smith shows once again that he can act, but he has actually played more dramatic rolls in his short career then Jackie Chan. This movie first shows that Jackie Chan can act, and second that Jaden Smith has star potential.While, I love the original movie, this new movie is better. The original was a great b-movie that reached cult status. This new one is much broader in scope. It shows the cult clash between east and west that was never in the first movie. Of course that movie was set in LA, and this new on in China. The film takes full advantage of being shot in China. The new movie also shows the clash within China between more modern and old fashion.",The Karate Kid

144,interestingfunstuff,Did the Chinese Government Help Write the Screenplay?,1,2 May 2013,"I can still remember my very favorable emotional response after all these years to the original Karate Kid! This poor remake does not light a candle to the original. I found this version of the Karate Kid to be sour, dour and at times, agonizingly contrived. I was also surprised that Jaden Smith often came across as a pouty rich kid not getting his way. Regardless if I had seen the original Karate Kid, or not, I still would have strongly disliked this new version because it lacks heart and believability!This is also a very political film! China is portrayed as a wonderful country full of stunning beauty and regular people, like you and me. It felt like the screenplay was approved by a Public Relations firm hired by the Chinese government. Whether that actually happened, or not, China was portrayed in such a misleading way you would think there's hardly any difference between, say, Brooklyn, New York and Beijing, China! But there are REALLY BIG differences! Here is a succinct summary by a retired Chinese college professor on how incredibly different our two cultures are: ""China is a one-party dictatorship. All the real power in China is firmly in the hands of nine men -- the members of the standing committee of the Politburo of the Chinese COMMUNIST PARTY (CCP). The People's Congress is just a rubber stamp of the Politburo of the CCP; the Government a mere front of the Party. The armed police force, the regular police force and the judicial system, as well as the mammoth mass media, are all under the tight control of the Party, which means the CCP leadership controls both the bodies and minds of the population. Even religions are under government control. Believers can only worship in government-sanctioned and supervised churches, temples and mosques. The Chinese internet police, composed of about 30,000 university graduates with degrees in computing sciences, monitor and intercept internet communication 24 hours, seven days a week.There is no freedom of thought, no freedom of speech. Dissenters are severely punished. The spokesperson of the CCP regime recently said at a news conference that there are no political dissenters in China, only ""criminals"". The last bastion of the CCP dictatorship is the mighty armed forces of China -- the People's Liberation Army, which pledges its absolute loyalty to the CCP, and declares its dual function of maintaining domestic stability as well as national defense."" If that's not bad enough, I'll also add: ""Only ONE PERCENT of the China's 560 million city dwellers breath air considered safe by European Union standards according to a World Bank study. Air pollution is particularly bad in the rust belt areas of northeastern China. A study done by the World Health Organization (WHO) estimated that the amount of airborne suspended particulates in northern China are almost 20 times what WHO considers a safe level."" These huge differences between our two cultures were only too happily glossed over by Hollywood in order to maximize their profits. I'm also sure the Chinese government would have pulled the plug on filming the Karate Kid in a heartbeat if they didn't like the screenplay!",The Karate Kid
145,infoalwaysacritic,"Like the classic, making the same mistakes",6,6 April 2015,"If you're like me, the original karate kid movies were a formative part of my youth. It gave a picture of martial arts to the youth of my era, that was exciting, empowering and it was age appropriate - unlike the violent and punitive films for the more adult audience. This film promised to deliver a similar experience, but with the flairs of modern film making. Unfortunately, with the points of contention that exist with the obnoxious American character in a glorified bully fight, it repeats the errors of the original, but in a more sensitive environment.The china that is portrayed in the film is one of a dense population that loves to be outdoors, mingling between classes of society. As a result of this blended environment, the world portrayed lacks depth, or nuance and paints part of itself as a propaganda film of a happy and athletic populace. There are some things they get right, with small mentions of water conservation devices, mixed architecture, and several locations are visited, with only a few being recycled for key locations. The overall setting of the film still feels a little plastic.The story itself centres around a boy being bullied, and learning to earn and value respect through the use of wushu - or martial arts. The main character, in this iteration, is considerably younger in his appearance and behaviour, and his antics and attitude make it difficult to have any affection for him outside of pity. Indeed it is a mystery through most of the film, why the romantic interest even finds him appealing. Despite this, Wenwen Han manages to bring charm to some distractingly awkward dialogue and rescues the romantic moments in the relationship that dominates the first half of the film.Jackie Chan does a decent job playing the mentor, but the role shares the same conflict as the plot. Do not expect to see Jackie in any compelling fight scenes or doing any stunts in this film. He plays a broken man, living in a strange dwelling, while working as a humble maintenance man. Despite repeatedly professing kung-fu as being a way to make peace, not war, he trains the main character to fight so that he no longer has to be afraid. Afraid of what? Afraid of being beaten up. So the solution is to train so you can beat ""them"" up instead? While this is consistent with the original film, it is a premise that fails to deal with the heart of the issues that we see today, and does not touch on a healthy avenue for kids to deal with bullying, ie. talking to your parents and teachers. So the impetus to train in martial arts is not one of necessity, but one of choice for a kid with attitude who hasn't attempted any proper process.Jaden Smith has much to do to earn the respect of the audience, and on this point there are many who would argue that he did not. His character was one that was weak enough that it is hard to say whether he ruined it, or if the character ruined him. Putting the drama aside, it was painfully obvious that while Jaden could go through the movements required in the physical fights, he was clearly inferior to his opponents.Conclusion: Keep a light heart, and you can enjoy this film for what it is, a trumped up bully fight in a world that resembles a pamphlet for Chinese tourism, printed in an American office. Young teens looking for a fantasy of beating up their bullies will be entertained.",The Karate Kid
146,samtko-04675,Doesn't really feel like a remake,7,4 November 2019,"It's hard to really call this movie a remake of The Karate Kid, for one thing none of the characters are the same except for Mr. Han (who is very much like Mr. Miyagi), the type of fighting is also not Karate in this film, it's actually Kung-Fu; it sort of has a similar story and the theme is similar.All these things aside the film is pretty decent, it's not as good as the original film and the stakes don't feel nearly as high (the kid's age plays a part in that since Dre is 12 while Daniel is in highschool), but nevertheless it's a worthwhile watch, it has some good choreography and the acting is pretty decent even from the child actors.Overall I wouldn't call this a remake rather more of it's own film that's got inspiration from The Karate Kid. But it's worth a watch",The Karate Kid
147,DiamondGirl427,Good But Lacking In Some Ways...,6,12 June 2010,"I went to see this with my 2 very excited grandsons. The theater was semi-filled with people..most were parents with children too young to be at the movies in the the first place...sorry..but if your kid cannot sit for 2 hours without talking out loud constantly or repeatedly standing up blocking other movie goers..then hire a babysitter please. Anyway..as to the movie...it was very watchable...quite entertaining for the most part...yet..it also was lacking in a few areas. First of all..I get the part about the single mother taking a better job, the hassles of moving to a new place, etc...etc..but this woman did not seem to be a very responsible mother at all. She lets her young son roam around in a strange city at random, never inquires about him meeting new friends or questions anything when he starts spending time with the handyman. Most of the movie..she spent dressing up in over-done outfits..while the only parenting she seemed to do was yell at the kid for throwing his jacket on the floor...a running theme throughout the movie. It almost appeared as if this actress was chosen because there was no way she could ever upstage Jaden Smith at any point. None of the other characters seemed strong enough to do so either. The other kids in the kung fu class were all kind of lumped together..with the exception of the one bully..who was mean...but only because he was told to be that way by his sensi. The girl who was the love interest was exceptional...she is fresh and so lovely...and seemed a little too old to be interested in Jadens' character....who did not look like he was 12. This was a vehicle for Will Smith to showcase his son again...as a first billed actor...and it seemed to work...but unless Hollywood..and his parents...allow him to grow and find his own place in the acting world...he will simply follow in his fathers' footsteps and do the same action stuff. Let the kid find his own path. Having major stars for parents is great for getting doors open...let the rest happen as it will.

148,michael-stenlund,A clear 10-star,10,8 February 2017,"No spoilers is what I have to promise you here.This movie was a clear 10-out-of-10 because it carried all the ingredients that a true Kung Fu movie needs. It showed how life has kung-fu written all through it, and how strength does not come from our muscles, but it comes from the heart. The film portrays a young 12-year old boy from Detroit Michigan who moves to China with his mother. By showing this boy the formula for the kung fu religion, his teacher tells him the true story of his own life and how what he may have lost in life, made him a master in kung fu. This makes the boy, in turn, also become an eager learner because he too... loses something very valuable.And the story goes on from there.I have never seen a better kung fu movie in my life, and this in my honest opinion blew away the original because it brought back so many of the missing themes that the book has. This felt more like the book.I hope that some of you agree that rating this under a 10 is not acceptable. Life is Kung fu, live with the yin and yang or you do not live at all.",The Karate Kid
149,david-2829,Sticks close to the original storyline with new characters and a gorgeous setting,7,4 April 2011,"A decent re-imagining of the classic ""Karate Kid"" (1984), that follows the basic storyline closely but changes the characters and locations. As a big fan of the original, it was fun to see so many plot elements intact (the big bully, the romance between two mismatched individuals, the calm and good-natured mentor, etc.) In fact, the closeness of the story allows for the funniest moment in the film - having to do with the chopsticks & catching a fly!I really enjoyed seeing China on film: from the Forbidden City to the Bird's Nest, the Great Wall to the mountain-top temple... it's gorgeous and still feels fresh. Jackie Chan did a very good job as the ""Mr. Miyagi"", although it's hard not to wish for Pat Morita's warm smile and unique voice. ""Aii, Danielson""What really spoils this movie from being great is that it tries to make everything bigger and better than the original. The fighting is rougher, the ""bad"" instructor is over-the-top (way out of character), the romance is an even bigger stretch, etc. Even the running time is expanded at well over 2 hours! Another problem is that instead of a teenage boy finding his way in a new location, you have what appears to be an 11-year old boy in a role that is 6 years too early! Original: Sweep the leg New: Break the leg... Original: Wins with ""Crane Technique"" New: Wins with some one-legged back-flip impossibility Original: Learns special moves by doing hard labor New: Learns special moves by repeating jacket on, jacket offAre we really supposed to believe that picking up a jacket teaches you how to duck a kick to the head? It's a fine line to make something a little fantastical without exceeding the audience's ability to suspend belief... and this Karate Kid snaps the line early on. Enough nit-picking though. It was an enjoyable film - especially for fans of the original. While not destined for the category of classic like the original - at least they made a respectable, spirited film.",The Karate Kid
150,wolverinesforever,Okay remake; Jaden Smith makes it worth it,7,16 June 2010,"Let's get this out of the way: if you've seen the 1984 version, you've seen most of the 2010 version. Not only does this remake follow the previous film scene by scene in multiple cases, it occasionally follows it shot by shot (the climax is a good example). So it probably shouldn't come as a surprise that this remake contains many of the same strengths and weaknesses of the 1984 version.What are the downsides? Well, first, the bullies remain underdeveloped. True, their motive in the 1984 version for bullying Daniel was petty (he went out with one of the members' ex-girlfriend), but you at least knew why. Here, it is never explained; we are left to simply assume it is because he is a new kid. The adherence to the original also caused me to get impatient occasionally, since I knew what event would happen next, whether I liked it or not. A couple of characters and events get introduced, but are forgotten by film's end. And the fight scenes aren't as discernible as in the 1984 version (although, thankfully, I could still make out what was going on).Still, despite the weaknesses, this film does have more merits. For once, this summer, we are given a protagonist with a good, strong, character arc. The screenplay does the character of Dre Parker a great favor by making him a well-rounded character and making his journey an emotionally compelling one. Jaden Smith is surprisingly solid; he has a good on-screen presence and gives a very convincing performance. His relationships with Mr. Han (Jackie Chan) and Meiying (Wenwen Han) are also handled with great care. Both Chan and Han are convincing in their roles.Not only does the film explore the world of kung fu, but also the world of Taoism. It's never mentioned, but Mr. Han's teaching of ""inner energy"" and fighting only when it is necessary to defend are very much in line with Taoist principles (Taoism is one of the ""three teachings"" of China). While you're liking of the film may greatly depend on whether you've seen the 1984 version or not, it can at least be said that Jaden Smith is very good in this film and that his journey is actually worth something to the audience. Considering how many summer films so far have forgotten to get us emotionally involved with the protagonist(s), it is a little relieving to see the remake of ""The Karate Kid"" care for its main character's journey and have us be emotionally involved too.",The Karate Kid
151,siobhanmckibbin,The Karate Kid Re-invented,8,3 October 2010,"When i first heard that they were doing a remake of The Karate Kid, I like most people wondered why they would even want to tamper with the already perfect version made in 1984. But on first viewing, now only did i enjoy this film but quite frankly i was astounded.Although there are similarities, the 2010 Karate Kid has been completely revamped and brought into line with the 21st Century. The slang and the music used especially contribute to this. One of the highlights is actually seeing Jayden Smith body popping to Flo Rida, which has drawn the conclusion that he has definitely inherited his dad's talents.What makes this movie so successful is the relationship between the two main protagonists; Dre Parker(Jayden Smith) and Mr Han (Jackie Chan). Dre finds himself in unknown territory in China after his mum uproots them from Detriot, and in no time he is clashing with the locals, who already practice the art of Kung Fu. After taking an instant liking to the young boy Mr Han, agrees to teach Dre. This is where the film really starts to begin. Both characters are explored on an emotional level, which not only makes them more authentic, but we the audience can fully connect with the main protagonists.In the original Karate Kid, Daniel learns about Mr Miagi's family. There is a similar scene in the remake, which seals the relationship between Dre and Mr Han. What is un-deniable is the chemistry between the two actors. It becomes more like a father-son relationship, rather than a teacher-student relationship. This scene is one of the most pivotal scenes in the film, and the director obviously took a lot of care when staging it, which he should be praised for.What is commendable is the film makers knew exactly where to end the movie. It was not dragged on too long, that you found yourself distracted. Quite the opposite; you were fully engaged and caught up in the tournament, that when the film ended on a still shot of Dre and Mr Han, you almost felt like jumping out of your seat and cheering like the spectators.Those who have, like me, pre-judged The Karate Kid before actually seeing it, should give this film a chance. It should not be treated as a remake but a re-modernisation of a classic 80's film, created for a new generation.",The Karate Kid
152,jgregg42,The Karate Kid Strikes Like a Cobra,8,14 June 2010,"I was hesitant when I saw the trailer for ""The Karate Kid"" a month ago. I thought, ""Here we go again."" When I see a potential rehash or remake or a reboot of something from my childhood I can usually hear cash registers cha-chinging in the background. That sound typically means that somewhere Hollywood executives are getting their wings and are about to make a down payment on a house in the hills or buy yet another Rolex to add to their collection. Like most Gen-Xers I am apprehensive and cynical when it comes to these matters.I also know that I can be wrong from time to time. And, on the rare occasion that I am wrong I will admit it. I first had a feeling that I was wrong once the opening credits of ""The Karate Kid"" were rolling and I saw that two of the producers were Will and Jada Pinkett Smith. These are two people in Hollywood that probably aren't out to make a quick buck. Considering their kid is in the lead role, they probably are going to treat the film with a little more care.The story begins with the main character, Dre Parker (Jaden Smith, son of the aforementioned producers) leaving Detroit with his mom to relocate to China. It is immediately established that there is no dad and that he is an only child. Once in China Dre has trouble adapting to the culture and the language (however, every person in China seems to be able to speak English). He makes a few friends and quickly finds a love interest all within an hour or two of landing. Much of this story is going to sound familiar because the writers didn't deviate from the original ""Karate Kid"" too much.As soon as Dre finds love he finds bitter enemies. He is involved in his first fight where he tries out his amateur fighting skills resulting in a black eye. It only gets worse for him at his new school. He tries to find a way to defend himself but discovers that the only kung fu class in town also teaches his enemies. Dre eventually retaliates and is once again finding himself outnumbered and on the losing end of a brawl. Enter the maintenance man, Mr. Han (played by Jackie Chan), who comes to save the day in a humorous fight scene. If you have seen previous Chan movies you will most likely appreciate the fight sequence here. I didn't think it would be too funny to see an older man beat up on a bunch of young punks, but again I was wrong. I enjoyed watching Chan deviate from playing the fighting comic; his role here is much more somber than what he has previously done.Mr. Han tries to reason with the instructor at the kung fu school about the behaviors of his students and enrolls Dre in to a kung fu tournament. Mr. Han takes Dre in and teaches him the ancient art of how to pick up his jacket (think wax on, wax off and you will get the idea). Through the course of the rest of the movie the audience is given some breathtaking views of China while also following Dre's kung fu training. It is never really explained why Mr. Han has to teach Dre kung fu on top of the Great Wall of China other than the fact that it is really cool to see in a movie.As in the original movie the story climaxes at a championship tournament, where as in the original, the protagonist defeats everyone in the tournament to make it to the final round therefore facing his bitter enemy. The movie is over two hours long but that final scene at the tournament made it seem well worth it. I can't remember the last time I was in a theater where the audience was cheering and clapping.Should you see this movie? Quite simply, yes. It gives you a solid story line that has been holding up for the last 25 years along with a mix of age appropriate humor and some action. The real difference between the original and this movie is the improved fight sequences. If you are a Gen-Xer, leave your cynicisms at the door, take your kids and enjoy a good family movie.",The Karate Kid

155,jccwu,"It's a pretty cute movie, but it doesn't nearly have the type of impact the original had.",6,23 June 2010,"This movie is more than just an updated version of the 1984 film ""The Karate Kid"", it's a remake! There are scenes, dialogs, editing and even facial expressions that are completely identical to the original. Sometimes it can even be a distraction, as you can't help but to compare the two films from one another.This new version has nothing to do with Karate, as it focuses only on Kung Fu. The name of The Karate Kid is strictly to let the fans know that this is a remake, so that the audience doesn't feel that the story is unoriginal or as though this film is a rip-off. As an updated remake, it works; but it's way too long as there are numerous scenes that seems to put the movie to a halt. This film should garner new fans of the 1984 story & include more younger fans, especially the pre-teens.Ralph Macchio was already 22 when he starred in the original film, but he was playing a teenager. Jaden Smith almost seems too adorable to be playing this role, as he's the new kid who is being bullied after moving to China. Even though Jaden Smith is supposed to be 12 in this film, he was actually 10/11 years old when he shot the movie. He's too young to be involved in this story, including his bullies and his love interest. Since his parents (Will Smith & Jada Pinkett Smith) are the producers and Jaden's youth would generate fans of his own age; are the main reasons for the characters being a lot younger in this remake. Even though I believe that Jaden Smith is too cute to play this role, I have to give him a lot of credit as I was very impressed with his performance in this film.As for Jackie Chan (Mr. Han), this is a perfect role for his veteran status. He is getting up there in age and it's harder to believe in him as a martial arts hero in the leading role. This supporting role as a mentor works well for him, as he can act his age and still use his charm & humor to help carry this film. Even though he does a fine job as the new teacher to the new kid, nothing can compare to the impact that Pat Morita had with the Mr. Miyagi character.There are similarities behind the two methods of how these teachers taught their apprentices, but the original was much better & more effective to its film. Jackie Chan started Smith's training by initially repeating the motion of picking up, putting on/off & hanging his jacket. This is similar to Mr. Miyagi's ""Wax on, Wax off"" method; although in the original version, Mr. Miyagi had his apprentice do A LOT more tedious work instead of just the jacket method that Jackie Chan demonstrated. The art of waxing Mr. Miyagi's cars, painting his house & fence were a lot more effective in the original film; which really seems lacking the new version. Also, the final tournament in the 1984 film seemed more realistic; as the remake seemed more like a video game.The major character dilemma that is lacking in the new version that the original had, were the stereotype, prejudice & racism that Mr. Miyagi had to endure; which is something that Jackie Chan never has to face since he lives in his native country. That dilemma now faces Jaden Smith's character; which in reality, causes a dilemma for the producers of this film if they ever want to make a sequel. Since this movie is now successful, it will be difficult to do a remake of ""The Karate Kid part II"", which takes place in Mr. Miyagi's native country; which is already occurring in this remake.If you grew up or loved the original 1984 version of ""The Karate Kid"", you will be doing a lot of these side-by-side comparisons. It's inevitable! For anyone who've never seen the original movie, it's a refreshing & updated story for a new generation. It's a pretty cute movie, but it doesn't nearly have the type of impact the original had.",The Karate Kid
156,MisterMxyzptlk,Lacks emotional punch.,4,31 August 2010,"Here's a very forgettable remake of the marginally better original. Our current incarnate has Jayden Smith take on the role of the said title. He meets legendary Jackie Chan after unwilling moving to China. Together they form a tepid relationship and battle each other's drawbacks. Dre (Smith) seems to appreciate the girl next door, but is hounded by bullies. After series of beatings, Jayden and Chan begin his training to defeat the kids at the year end tournament. Which looks more like a graphic for Street Fighter than any authentic spectacle. The movie moves a a considerable slow pace and we are forced to endure most of the time watching Smith make time with another 12 year old. I can't think of anything more mind-numbing than watching children go through the motions of a relationship we know is futile. Chan and Smith don't demonstrate any real emotional connection that allows them to arrive at the destination the film shows us. Jayden is passionless in this role and doesn't even shed a tear near the end as to how frustrating his last few months have been. Chan does his best to overshadow the role by Pat Morita, but fails. All the single best elements that made the first Karate Kid actually sufferable were stripped out here. The fights are better, but the heart is simply gone.",The Karate Kid

Good thing is I could watch the updated version unbiased, and what a pleasant surprise this film was! Young Mr. Smith, who obviously inherited the one or other acting gene from his parents (who, among others, produced this movie), gives an eye opening performance as a fatherless teenager who moves to China with his mother and learns that school bullying exists on any continent. It is a local maintenance man who teaches the kid self confidence, friendship and - yes - karate. Jackie Chan is remarkable in a purely dramatic role. Broad comedy you won't find in this long but exhilarating and rewarding crowd pleaser.",The Karate Kid
158,Jaymay,An insult to movie-lovers everywhere,1,12 September 2010,"It's truly a pleasure to be able to give this movie the lowest possible rating of one star.The remake of the Karate Kid really does represent everything that is wrong with Hollywood today. Columbia pictures has taken a great, beloved film and recycled it for cheap profit.The original Karate Kid film is a beloved gem for several reasons. Pat Morita, a beloved character actor and a fine man, was given the chance to be the star of a movie and he delivered beyond anyone's wildest dreams. The relationship between Morita and Ralph Macchio's Daniel was touching and perfectly done.Part of what made the original movie work is that it was about class differences. You really believed that Daniel was a poor kid from the wrong side of the tracks who was struggling to fit in at a new school. And you believed in the awkward puppy love with rich girl Elizabeth Shue. With Jaden Smith, the son of a multi-millionaire actor, you don't believe in for a millisecond. This kid has never had to struggle for anything in his life. The entire emotional premise of the film doesn't work at all.Everything that is any good in this disgusting Jaden Smith/Jackie Chan remake is lifted out of the original film. There is nothing redeeming about it beyond that. Jaden Smith can't act, he can't emote, and you don't believe him for a second. Beyond that, he's too young and too small to play the role. You simply don't believe for a moment that he could actually beat these other kids in a tournament. It's ridiculous. The scene where Jackie Chan breaks down crying has to be one of the worst-acted, horrible dramatic moments ever put to film. Like the remake of Willy Wonka, The new Karate Kid movie is an instance of Hollywood cannibalizing its own best work for short term profit. There were dozens of original, creative, magical new stories that were turned down so that this movie could be made. We are all the poorer for it.",The Karate Kid
159,proterozoic,Kicks Butt,9,26 March 2011,"I spent time in Beijing in the late 1990s, and let me tell you, that was some kind of culture shock. Did you know that before Pampers landed on Asian shores, all Chinese infants were traditionally dressed in open-crotch onesies, so they could go where they wanted? I didn't. One of the most indelible memories from my first week was watching a kid do his business on the sidewalk, after which a smiling uncle turned on a hose and sent it all flowing under our shoes.This doesn't happen to Dre, the 12-year-old protagonist of the Karate Kid remake, but he's still in for a rough ride. The heartwarming story of a youngster who finds his inner self by learning to beat ropes of bloody snot out of his tormentors gets a fish-out-of-water revamp: in a nice dig for the grownups, Dre's mother moves to China for her unspecified automotive-related job, since ""there is nothing for us in Detroit."" Dre hates Beijing from the first five minutes, and it doesn't help that he gets pummeled into the dirt by an Enisatzgruppe of psychotic local bullies.But wait, it's China, where everybody knows kung-fu! After a week of beatdowns, Dre is rescued by Jackie Chan's Mr. Han, a local Mr. Fixit who also happens to be a martial arts master. One thing leads to another, and after a surprisingly tense scene at the bad guys' dojo, Mr. Han wins Dre a reprieve from schoolyard torment by enrolling him in a massive kung-fu tournament. As the other Dre used to sing, at this point it's do or die, and our young hero only has a few months to get good and beat the locals.This movie is about as good a genre picture as I've ever seen. Many negative reviews say that it was too long, but I think that was one of its strengths. The movie displays that rarest of virtues – patience, as dramatic tension gets a chance to build up, characters can develop and a sense of place is established. The amount of abuse Dre takes at his school and the humiliation of having to hide from his bullies are painful and raw. Instead of a slick and precocious showbiz brat, Jaden Smith comes off as small, unguarded and very real. Jackie Chan shines in a dramatic role, especially the scene where he tells his young pupil his life story. The bullies are pitiless jerks, but are given good reasons to be that way. The love story, though utterly contrived and perfunctory, is still charming and fun.The movie is ultimately something of a puff piece on the Heavenly Kingdom, but who cares, if it shows such genuine engagement with its subject? It's full of Chinese characters that are played by Chinese people! They speak to each other in actual Chinese and not English with fake accents – even with Americans present! Mr. Han's shack looks so authentic, some old handyman probably went right to back to work inside after filming wrapped up (though his home was uncharacteristically huge – I've yet to see a real Chinese living room that could fit a motorized rickshaw, let alone a four-door sedan; a handyman's job won't buy you a yard in Beijing, either).All in all, it's an accomplishment to imbue a story that's as familiar as a passion play with personality, interest and a good amount of realism. By the time the resolution came around, I didn't even mind that in the final tournament, Dre pulls off a flip-kick on one foot that Jackie Chan himself might have snagged on. His mother also breaks the spell a bit when she loudly cheers for her son from the bleachers. A real American mom would have gotten up halfway through the first round of face-bashing, rushed to the stage over a trail of broken, moaning martial arts masters, and snatched her precious darling away from harm before storming home and filing 1,336,718,015 lawsuits.It's interesting to note that The Karate Kid rode the globe and made 350 million dollars on the shoulders of a little black kid and his Chinese mentor, with half the movie in subtitles. In fact, there was one single Caucasian actor in the whole film, with about 10 lines of dialogue. Things have definitely changed.",The Karate Kid

Jaden Smith is on screen far too much and is almost as wooden as the peg he repeatedly hangs his coat on.In the original Karate Kid film the tasks given to Daniel Larusso are more believable in Karate instruction, rather than simply hanging a coat on a wooden peg.

Collectors covet guns that have been crafted to carry out King Herod's massacres and go mad searching for cars that have been made to take his grandmother shopping.As if this obsession is not enough, there is another group of people that searches for, believe it not, skulls. They give themselves fancy names like anthropologists and whatchamacallit. All this 'skulldiggery' only to prove that our great great grandparents and their aunts were all a bunch of monkeys. As if we need more proof. A casual glance at the number of men scratching their nuts in public places ought to give anybody more than enough proof without needing to actually dig for it.The old guns blow up in your face if you try to use them, the old cars drink enough fuel to cause global warming in Pluto and the old skulls prove that if we were alive back then, dentists could have made a killing with the recommendation of braces.The verdict then seems to be fairly simple. The new models are better.No, no, no. Do not say it aloud.As soon as you do, you will have a short balding man in glasses and hair sticking out of his nose will appear from around your table and say it is not true and talk about movies and how the movies of the past are so much better than the movies of today and go on and on till you bleed to death from your ears.This brings us to the new kid on the block – The Karate Kid.The old kid of '84 with the tight script and an Oscar nominated performance by Pat Morita and a fresh story line is definitely the sort of an original that could well be impossible to beat.The new kid starts of with this drawback that the old kid is impossible to beat. Saddled with this drawback, it performs like a training athlete on weights. The only thing that can happen is getting stronger.The direction is crisp. The movie engages you with the first scene.

And this time, without even using his kung-fu. The anguish in his eyes, the defeat in his walk, the hope in his words. This is Jackie Chan at his sensitive best.

169,seekingallthetime,A Brilliant movie full of entertainment.,8,9 December 2014,"This is a brilliant movies in every aspect. It is adventurous, dramatic, action filled and passionate. Many people just started relating it with the 1984's movie of the same title in one way or another, just a fraction among them conclude that this is just a copy of that old movie and is bad. Chan made this to revive the old story in more realistic, artistic, natural and skilled way and he succeeded. Here is just a brief comparison just to point out that this 2010's movie is far better than the old one.1- Marshal Arts: We see original karate (or the Kung Fu whatever) as Jakie Chan is a known marshal arts expert, while in 1984's, the instructor did not know marshal arts in real life. Chan is an actual martial-arts expert, Morita got his start as a stand-up comedian known as ""The Hip Nip,"" and there's no question who's more qualified to play an actual karate teacher. Even Morita could not show any karate expertise, yet he had a Japanese face enough to convince people of that time that he was the guru.2- We see fights scenes plus tournament fights that simulates real marshal arts techniques (except some as you know its a movie), while in 1984's movie, the fight scenes resembles street fights, moreover those were camera-cut to try to make people believe it was karate, but we all know that wasn't.3- The old 1984's movie was made, directed by and everything-done by American media persons, in that time, it is now the OLD TIME, and THIS recalls our old memories, and we know that this memory things made us excited and sentimental, and simply we like that much because its an old memory.4- Visual scenes: We see a lot of indoor and outdoor natural scenes that make the 2010's movie adventurous, whereas in 80's movie, there is nothing like this, rather the 80's movie now seems more like a TV Movie.5- The passion in every character in the 2010's movie is realistic and appealing, seems like natural/original. The 80's movie is more like a fantasy movie, example of cinéma vérité (A movie that shows ordinary people in actual activities without being controlled by a director). However 1984's movie was a success because the story in that and in this is capable enough to get the sympathy of the audience.6- Physical practice: In this case, although 2010's movie lacks many things, it just clearly wipes out the 1984's movie. Jackie Chan, as usual, showed the pupil that how real life actions are involved in the fight, he makes him repeat and repeat, that is the practice. Beside the physical practice, Jackie Chan teaches his student psychological / spiritual aspects of marshal arts. On the other hand, in 1984's movie Morita just made a joke with martial arts as he was basically a comedian.People compare these two movies only for psychological and sentimental aspects, there is no match between these 2.",The Karate Kid

I did think the bully in the new version was the equal or better than the bully in the first version of this movie.To me, the only thing that was more appealing in this movie than the original was the young girl who played the love interest of Jada Pinkett Smith.

171,geniuskentyk-1,The Karate Kid is a perfect remake!,9,9 July 2010,"The 2010 ""The Karate Kid"" remake was a surprisingly enjoyable movie. I remember when the first trailer for the movie came out; I thought to myself, ""Wow, yet another Hollywood remake of a beloved film. It's gonna be horrible! It's gonna suck!"" Boy, am I proud to be wrong!The new remake apparently resembles the original film a lot, and I've seen the original when I was young. I don't remember the original at all, so the remake was fresh to me. The plot follows 12-year-old Dre Parker (Jaden Smith) as he and his mother move all the way to Beijing, China. The move from America to China makes the drama and tension Dre faces all the more real. Dre's first experience with China's a bad one. On his first day, he makes friends, including a young Chinese girl he clearly likes. At the same time, however, Dre meets the local bully, Cheng. Cheng, throughout the entire movie, is such an asshole; he's a ruthless and merciless monster – that's how I would describe him. Cheng's martial arts master is the reason for his ruthlessness, for he teaches his students horrible lessons on martial arts and life in general. There are several scenes of Cheng beating up Dre, and they're just so hard to watch; the scenes were unbearable and so powerful we feel Dre's pain. Luckily, though, Dre's janitor, Mr. Han, is a Kung Fu master. Later on in the film, Mr. Han agrees to train Dre in Kung Fu, in order to defeat Cheng in a Martial Arts competition.Jackie Chan playing Mr. Han in ""The Karate Kid"" is unique because it's a more serious role than Chan's usual fun-loving, comedic roles. Jackie Chan does an awesome job at portraying Mr. Han as a serious mentor who has a mysterious and traumatic past. We discover these clues to his past throughout the film, but these clues never connect until the very scene where Mr. Han opens up about the traumatic experience. Jackie Chan was very effective in that emotional scene, and I did get kinda of teary- eyed at that part.One highlight I liked from the film was the moment Dre learned that the 'Jacket Routine' Mr. Han had him do over and over again truly did have everything to do with Kung Fu. That scene was extremely well-done and exciting. The scenery of the entire film benefited from the fact that the movie was actually filmed in China. The scenery included beautiful mountaintops, treetops, gardens, and temples. The third act of the film, the tournament, was also well-done. All of the fights presented were exciting, action-packed, and sometimes funny. Whenever Cheng or a member of his martial arts team is on deck, though, it's pretty intense. Cheng's team play dirty.Now, I'd like to point out a few certain things. Yes, the movie's called ""The Karate Kid"" even though the movie focuses on Kung Fu. We distinguish this very clearly early on in the movie. Obviously the title was kept the same as the original in order to appear more appealing – ""The Karate Kid"" franchise is extremely popular, so why fix what isn't broken? I wouldn't have mind, nonetheless, if the title of the movie WAS renamed ""The Kung Fu Kid"", but for the sake of the original name's popularity, it was kept as ""The Karate Kid."" Some other complaints involved Jackie Chan not being able to replace Pat Morita as Mr. Miyagi from the original film. I agree that no one can replace the original Mr. Miyagi, but that's why the mentor in the remake's named Mr. Han. Jackie Chan's not playing Mr. Miyagi, he's playing Mr. Han, so haters need to hop off. Also, who DOESN'T like Jackie Chan? Honestly, this movie wouldn't have been as effective without Jackie Chan as the Kung Fu master. Jackie is popular in both America and Asia, and he's loved by everyone! If anyone was to replace Pat Morina, it'd definitely be Jackie Chan, no doubt about it.I liked the movie a lot, and I would've given the movie a perfect score if it weren't for a few little problems. The movie truly was gratifying and amazing, and I still felt its effects as I left the theater. It felt like a 4/4 star movie because of how well the movie was made, and how strong the cast was. But some things from the story were just short of the finish line. The love story between Dre and Mei Ying wasn't bad, and it moved the story along, but it just wasn't that effective. I mean, they're both 12-years-old, so it's not all that dramatic or important; it's just not that serious. Still, the romance part of the movie wasn't bad, it just wasn't realistic. I don't mind it at all, though. The kids in this movie are so young, all practically 12, so the ferociousness of the fight scenes are pretty unbelievable. They're great and all, but there just can't be kids like these in the world that are so heartless and ruthless. Up until the end of the movie, Cheng and his fellow teammates just seemed like pure-evil bullies. It's hard to see something like that in 12-year-old kids. However the fact that the movie shows us Cheng's mean-ass Martial Arts teacher as the reason for Cheng being the way he is, it'll do. All in all, the new 2010 ""The Karate Kid"" remake was an enjoyable movie with enough drama, excitement, action, and intenseness to keep me, and anyone else, entertained. It's a really good remake, and, I must say, is one of the best movies of 2010!",The Karate Kid

173,kat_777,"Sweet, cute, emotional, catchy",9,31 December 2011,"Thanks to Justin Bieber's never say never i have watched this movie.Dre parker moves to China with his mother where he meets mei ling and a lot of trouble. To help him overcome these troubles stepped in Mr Han who himself is dealing with a past trauma.Thr presentation was simple. The story is not extraordinary in any manner. It is simple but still the direction style itself was very nice. some parts are emotional too. especially the scene in the car where Mr Han finally confesses about his past to Dre and the scnen where Dre confronts his mom about their stay in china.Jaden Smith was fantastic. He has proved that he is the next upcoming superstar. His smile is so sweet that it reminds me of sugar. His kung fu moves are soo smooth and realistic and therefore an exceptional performance from a 12 year old. He looked totally different. Especially from his chubby, bubbly look in pursuit of happiness and the day the earth stood still. The way he presented the character may it be seriously or through comedy or through action.Jackie Chan was great as Mr Han. He is definitely the most versatile among the kung fu action heroes. He lives throughout the film just with his expressions. Taraji P Henson's character fascinated me as it reminded me a lot of my mom. The way she talks and behaves. ""Dre..... PICK up your jacket""All others were nice in their own roles.James Horner's score is very haunting as always. This is one movie I will always want to watch over and over again.The scenery alone can attract a person.9/10",The Karate Kid

175,AndrePhilidor,Enjoyable movie with a GLARING omission!,7,13 June 2010,"A well made movie with scenes of the Great Wall of China and the Forbidden Palace. No complaints at all about the acting. The pretty Chinese girl who makes up the love interest (well, puppy love) lights up the screen when she smiles.Now the complaints. (SPOILERS AHEAD.) Jaden Smith in the role of ""Dre"" with shoulder length hair in braids made us wonder through much of the film if he was a boy or a girl.Mr. Han (Jackie Chan) who meticulously rebuilds a smashed up car, then demolishes it with a sledge hammer each year, only to start all over again. We eventually learn he was driving, missed a turn while arguing with his wife (he can't even remember why) and his wife and young son were killed, and so beats up the car on the anniversary of the accident each year. Irrational behaviour, and doesn't compare with Karate Kid #1 where Ralph Machio discovers the secret of Mr. Myagi (the excellent Pat Morita), a Congressional Medal of Honor he won in WW II fighting for the United States (against the Japanese!) Dre (Jaden Smith) is insolent after leaving Detroit to live in China, and is disobedient, leaving his jacket tossed on the floor and disrespectful to his mother when she repeatedly asks him to pick it up.Mr. Han, the apartment janitor and maintenance man (Jackie Chan) agrees to teach Dre Kung Fu to defend himself against the class bully who beat him up. We do not have Mr.Myagi's ""Wax on, Wax off"" in polishing his antique car collection, we have ""Jacket on, Jacket off, throw it down, hang it up"", and repeat, over and over. Made no sense. The ""Wax on, Wax off"" routine was soon applied to essential karate moves and training. ""Jacket on, jacket off"" was just silly with no application to his training in the martial arts, nor apparently to teach him to be respectful to his mother.The Kung Fu matches were dramatic but some of the body somersault moves were unbelievable and clearly created by stunt men with artificial assistance and/or CGI filming.The major omission however was that the sadistic sensei training his students to give no quarter and to maim their opponents never gets his comeuppance unlike Karate Kid #1 where the diminutive Mr. Myagi gives the arrogant instructor of the opposition a richly deserved physical beating (effortlessy, it should be added).In KK #2, the Sensei tells his student in the match vs. Dre (Jaden Smith), ""Break his leg!"". Poetic justice demands that Mr. Han (Jackie Chan ) deliver a severe physical beating, and if that included breaking his leg, the audience would have stood up and cheered! Still, over all, a movie worth seeing.",The Karate Kid
176,midtra52,"Bad acting, too many corny parts",3,16 September 2010,"I give this movie a 3 out of 10 simply because Jackie Chan did save some of it. However Jaden Smith was painful to watch. I'm a firm believer that a good portion of the population could act if they had some acting lessons, however there are some people that just don't have the right frame of mind for it or the right attitude. The problem we've ran into as we have so many times before is an actor getting jobs simply because of their connections and not their abilities. This is what hurts many Hollywood movies and it certainly hurt this one.The storyline of this movie was actually pretty good, but the problem was the completely corny scenes that were thrown in. I mean we're seriously suppose to believe they took a 45 minute bus ride to just go running on the great wall where there were no other tourists? The fight scenes at the end were not much better. It was extreme over the top showmanship type fighting rather than anything realistic. Then there's the fact that a severely beaten, hobbling kid comes back out to fight and somehow the mother is cheering for him rather than worrying about his ACL being damaged for life and no one calls child protective services (if China has one I don't know). Anyway, it was ridiculous.",The Karate Kid
177,michaelgrantham,Excellent Atmospheric Remake - Jackie Chan Wonderful!,9,27 August 2012,"I have seen both the original film and this version (twice now) and just had to review it this time. The film has all the plot and story of the original and Jackie Chan makes a wonderful replacement for Pat Morita, who played Mr Miyagi in the original. There is some excellent filming in China, which really adds atmosphere. Most of all though, I agree with some of the other reviewers that Jackie Chan was at last allowed to show that he can act and not just clown it up (although he's very good at that too!). His performance in this was quite touching and that really made the movie for me.Jaden Smith did a credible job as his young protégé and I found his acting quite believable and not nearly as one-dimensional as some reviewers have commented.Very much a feel-good movie, It rated highly with me. A film for all the family to enjoy.",The Karate Kid
178,LessThanPaddy,A butchering of the original.,1,21 February 2017,"I can't berate this film enough. In fairness, most of my dislike stems from my love for the original. Not that remakes are always terrible, sometimes they can be good, there have been some that I've enjoyed... and then sometimes you come across remakes like this.Growing up, the original to me was a very classic 80s coming of age film about moving to an unfriendly environment and standing up to your bullies despite the odds. The characters were mostly likable, especially the noble Mr Miyagi who gradually bonds with the protagonist and teaches him to defend himself, in a very believable manor within a very realistic time frame. I loved it, and it meant a lot to me as a teen. Wasn't fussed on the sequels but that's irrelevant.... The remake on the other hand. No harm to Jackie Chan but he's no Pat Morita in the role of Mr Miyagi. In this version he teaches Jayden Smith also to overcome his bullies, but not standard high school teens... no, rather a gang of homicidal 10 year olds that are determined to murder the lead. I just plain don't believe that anyone could become a trained lethal weapon before they reach double digits, much less that Chan would ever get away with kicking the stuffing out of them all so that they won't murder him too... so instead he trains Smith to also be a killing machine in a very small time frame. Not a believable level of karate skill like in the original, but at mortal combat level within a few weeks. In fact he finishes off the leader with a backwards shooting star press head kick from about fifteen feet in the air... as if. More CGI overkill.It doesn't help that Jayden Smith is so unlikable too, before and after this production. No, this movie is dreadful, I don't think I'd be so vehemently against it if I didn't love the original but I'm certain I'd hate it regardless. I can't think of one redeeming factor this film has, not one. I like Jackie Chan, especially when I was younger, but not even his appearance in this film earns it any credit.Don't watch this movie, it has nothing to offer except the prospect of wasting your time.",The Karate Kid
179,Manth_Sigdaw,Jaden Smith and Jackie Chan Vs. Daniel and Mr. Miyagi,1,12 June 2013,"'nuff said.In the remake, the actors are always the actors. There's Wil Smith's kid, Jaden Smith. There's Jackie Chan playing himself, just a little more somber.In the original the actors became the characters. Daniel and Mr. Miyagi are legendary and the film is far superior to the 2010 remake which was just a star vehicle for Jaden Smith.Who cares if a little kid gets beat up anyway? When you're in elementary school, getting into fights is not that big a deal and it's still OK for a teacher or other adult to come and stop the fight. But a high school kid getting beat up and defending his manhood is a way more interesting and powerful story. They can't even do sequels to the Jaden Smith movie now that he's grown like 4 or 5 inches and looks like some big black muscular thug. No one will believe a kid like Jaden Smith will get harassed.Plus I never saw any Oscar nominations for Jackie Chan.",The Karate Kid

181,Homersan,"This ""Karate"" (Kung Fu) kid is made for the young generation...",5,4 July 2010,"What everybody needs to understand here is that if you ""remake"" any movie, which, in this case, has built such a large fan base over the last 20 years... it's going to get compared, not on an objective base, but based on ones emotions of seeing an 80's movie over and over, as oppose to this modern 2010 take on it.Personally I prefer the original movie, as I grew up watching it...and I admit acting out the ""crane technique"" over and over. But I think this movie is more aimed at the younger audience who can relate to Dre more than to Daniel. It's basically the same movie, right down the ""fly catching scene"", which has a more funnier ending in the new one, I must admit. Hilarious. And of course the ultimate tournament at the end. This was a little too chaotic for my taste, but maybe I'm just getting too old...Also, they name it Karate kid to profit from the original, but there's no karate in this movie... what's up with that ? Why not call it ""The Kung Fu Kid"" and mention it's based on the original karate kid... Just my opinion.The ""Wax on/Wax off"" changeover to ""Jacket on/Jacket off"" was also nicely done... didn't think they could reinvent something like that for this movie.But I was a little bit disappointed with his final kick... what's it called ? Cobra dance/kick ?? Although it was visual very fancy, I found that is was shot very unprofessional. Did you notice how far they were from each other? That's like rocky-far from each other... So how the hell was he able to hit from that distance, he's just turning around his own axle. Weird. And man, I dunno, but if you kick someone with the same foot you're landing on... aren't you going to lose balance when hitting the opponent? I don't do any martial arts so if I'm wrong, I apologize...To conclude, I think you young generation (10-16) kids will enjoy this version much more than the 80's original. As oppose to myself, late twenties going on thirties... I guess I'll be watching another rerun of the original in the future.Rating : 5/10 (for the effort)",The Karate Kid
182,filmbantha,Some things are just better left alone,6,11 July 2010,"Let's make it clear from the beginning, The Karate Kid is a blatant vehicle for Jaden Smith, with his all too famous father Will producing the movie in an attempt to bolster his son's acting career. Much like the criticism that Shane Meadow's Somers Town garnered for its association with Eurostar, it could be argued that the Karate Kid is a cleverly crafted two and a half hour long advert for Jaden Smith. That being said, it's a fairly well polished advert with Jaden putting in a solid performance, the only criticism that can be levelled at Smith is his age; the original Karate Kid was much older, broadening the films appeal to a wider audience, but as I watched pre-teens fighting I couldn't help feeling that this would alienate the teen audience as they will struggle to relate to the main character.Don't get me wrong, the original is hardly a masterpiece, as is clear from its recent relegation to the library of channel five Sunday afternoon family films that are usually only worth watching for the memories they rekindle, but in 1984 the influence it had over popular culture was widespread, with teens everywhere desperate to take up martial arts. There is no doubt that the new version will inspire a similar wave of interest and while this may indicate a certain amount of popularity, it is no indication of the film's quality, which doesn't come close to the sheer entertainment of the original.Without comparing the two versions, The Karate Kid is a fairly entertaining movie, it has its flaws - most notably its length, but children oblivious to the original will love watching Dre Parker (Jaden Smith) start a new life in China while finding his feet with the local gang. Jackie Chan puts in a stirling performance as Mr Han, the caretaker and karate master who dedicates his time to training Dre and teaching him the true art of karate, that shows he can actually act.The story arc remains very similar to the original with the main alteration being the setting, which provides some fantastic backdrops for the street battles and a striking training scene on the great wall of China. Visually the film is impressive and the acting is okay, but remakes are never going to compare favourably to their predecessors and a change to one of the most memorable scenes in the film (""wax on, wax off"") will be seen as blasphemous by fans of the original.This is definitely a film for the younger generation, people familiar with the 1984 version should stay well away but those heading into the film without preconceptions formed from viewing the original will find a fairly enjoyable story that is very easy to watch. As i know most people reading this will have seen the original, save your money, and if you haven't seen the karate kid, you're missing out on an eighties classic - go and buy the DVD now and forget about the new version. Some things are just better left alone.",The Karate Kid

Exactly the same role as his previous movie! He doesn't come a thousand mile close to Ralph Macchio. In the original K.K. series, I did like the kid, notwithstanding the absolute implausibility of the story (a few karate classes turning him in to a karate champion - impossible, period); this is not the case with this sad remake.

186,miketaylor2007,the real Karate Kid remake is called Never Back Down!,4,15 June 2010,I kind of agree with the other reviewers about this film being OK but should not be called The Karate Kid. Sure it is the same concept as the older ones and a story told well but in my opinion it was really nothing at all like the older Karate Kid. Will Smith's son does a decent job with the roll but my problem was he is way too young. One one of the things enjoyable about the old Karate Kid was Danielle Laruso being a teenager and fighting off bullys who are in highschool. Here we are seeing an 11 year old boy fighting off other 11 year olds which is OK I guess for a younger audience but for guys like me who are in our mid 20s were expecting a little bit of oldschool Karate Kid in there and in my opinion this did not deliver like the other classics. The older movies were pg 13 as it is and that was fine but this is like a watered down version of the old films which has a lot less fighting scenes (hardly any at all) and thats very disappointing for The Karate Kid. Jackie Chan did a great job his character was some what fun to watch but I feel like if it wasn't for Jackie Chan staring in the movie and being a fan of his work I would have honestly walked out of the theatre. I expected a lot more out of this and since I didn't care for it much I give it a 4/10.

187,loccomotive2000,Nice little touches make The Karate Kid a sizable hit.,7,13 June 2010,"I have always been neutral of the idea of movie remakes. While an interesting concept may deserve a reuse at a different era and produced with higher quality, we all know too well that it is the producers hoping to capture a bigger audience by remaking a movie many people have become familiar with. And too often, the values of good film making gets thrown out the window because marketing is all that matters for them.Such was almost the case for The Karate Kid, a remake of the 80s hit movie but has close to nothing about karate. Instead, our hero picks up kung fu in the land of China, making the title quite a shameless and blatant attempt to draw audiences who remember the original. In The ""Karate"" Kid, 12-year-old American boy Dre Parker is forced to move to China with his mother due to her job. As he tries to adapt to his new home, he falls for the local girl Mei Ying, which brings him to the wrath of the martial arts savvy bully Cheng, and his gang. Constantly harassed and with nowhere to turn to in the foreign land, rescue comes in the form of the cranky maintenance man, Mr Han, who turns out to be a master of kung fu. With Han as his master, Dre must now stand up to his bullies in the upcoming kung fu tournament to end their feud and earn their respect.Jaden Smith impresses here as the film's star, handling the action and emotional scenes in a performance his famous father would well approve of. As Dre, he delivers competently a youngster's transformation from the rash rebel to the calm and mature martial artist. And Jackie Chan shows that he could well survive on his acting chops alone in his brilliant delivery of Mr Han, the wise yet disturbed kung fu master.Being a remake, there was very little work needed for the plot, which brings us to the attention of the smaller details. And this is where the movie shines. Director Harald Zwart has managed to utilize the charisma and chemistry of Chan and Smith to great effect; from Dre's little gestures to comforting his heartbroken master, there is so much this movie can claim is uniquely it's own.And although the film does get unnecessarily draggy at times, with quite a number of subplots that are slightly unevenly played out, the training scenes and final battle accomplishes its job in engaging the viewer. As the audience cheered and clapped at the triumphant scenes, it became apparent to me that this remake had managed to capture much of the essence and spirit of the original. Overall, The Karate Kid is a highly enjoyable family film and a fine example of a remake capable of standing on it's own. The title could still use a change, though.",The Karate Kid

The second is after one more hour (!!), also with Him.I even do not want to write the details, in what ways this film flaws, and so on.I just lost more than two hours from my life...Nothing to compare with the original movie, that also had mistakes, but you could like it, you wanted to be Karate Kid, you wanted to do, copy, what the guy studied...Not like here.To mention some good points: Jackie Chan: every single scene he is in is worthwhile, and as an ACTOR, just watch Mr Han's breakdown, you have no more question what means to be an actor (JC is pretty good in acting, not only in kung-fu) the nemesis of Dre Parker ( J. Smith), Cheng (Zhenwei Wang): definitely, he will be seen as ""bad guy"" in the upcoming decade action films (strong as Mako...:) Weak and forced script, mediocre directing and camera, forgettable music, tough fight scenes, good acting Jackie Chan.Certainly, this is a vehicle for Jaden Smith (aka Will Smith Jr :), and that is right. And that is all.If you desire to watch re-played fight scenes on big screen in a computer game format, than buy ticket, eat one and a half hour something, than sit in the last 40 some minutes.In any other case, save yourself time, money, and once in a lifetime believe it, not worthy...PS: I never thought how much I will miss Ralph Macchio...:)",The Karate Kid

His acting was so fake and bad. Next are we back to the power rangers era? HI-YA! PO-WA! Really, do they have to do that every time they are practicing.

This is as formulaic as... well, let's just say everything is seen from a mile a way. That might not be bad. Sometimes the rousing Saturday matinée movie that gets the audience cheering in unison is just what the spirit needs. This just left me feeling cheated. It's poorly manipulative, actually pretty far fetched. If you feel like watching something brainless, corporate and IMO machined to death, watch this. PS- I don't want to seem the hater but this drivel made almost 200 million? Don't our kids deserve better than this? God knows they need it.",The Karate Kid
193,Jim-512,"Remake, a pleasant surprise.",6,18 February 2011,"I had to leave a comment on this. I decided to watch this, reluctantly thinking that it would be a cheesy play on the original, which I think is a great movie. For one, I thought it weird to be remake a movie so soon after the original...then I looked at the date - 26 years? Holy Smokes, time flies. This version of Karate Kid had as much, if not more, of the same ""feel good"" character as the original. I was pleasantly surprised. BUT, Jackie Chan has also always had a way of making any story better, just by the heart and bone he puts in his part. And I was thinking, ""that kid's subtle mannerisms sure remind me of someone...oh yeah. Will Smith."" I didn't know that was his son! Ha! Well, like father..... I've always had high regard for Will Smith's work. This remake did something that many 'remakes' disregard. It stayed pretty darned true to the original story, sometimes (almost) verbatim. I personally thought that was honorable. Giving that there was so radical a difference in the setting and environment, that was classy. Jackie Chan did ""Mr. Miyagi"" awesome. Definitely worth seeing.",The Karate Kid
194,modistreet,Disappointing,4,3 August 2010,"To start with the obvious, the martial art form used in the movie is KungFu not Karate. It should have been named ""The Kungfu Kid"". There was no build up of characters or animosity to hold the audiences attention for very long. The mother though necessary was useless in any way to the plot. Ralph Macchio in the First Karate Kid was in his early 20's when he did the movie, he should have been called the Karate guy or something, anyways I feel Jaden Smith was too small for the role. Other than the frightened child expression, he couldn't manage too much. I believe in any martial art form there is a weight class while in the movie, at least one of his opponent was double his age & weight. That is totally unrealistic. After initially floundering around Jaden just picks up every move on the first try. Machhio had a learning curve which made it believable. Though there were some exaggeration there in the older Karate Kid, but the storyline kept the audience captured, every one of us wanted really bad to be the person to beat up the bad guys. Here there was no villain just a bunch of confused kids going from an illegal moves to handing the trophy to the Jaden Smith with a smile on their faces. Total hogwash. Jackie Chan was OK but I found Mr. Miyagi's character a bit more livelier. That would have suited Jackie's character as well. All in all a disappointment in spite of all the hype.",The Karate Kid
195,PYRiAH,Looking forward to the sequel,8,13 December 2010,"Remakes are always a touchy subject. Especially when it is done with a movie people cherish and love like ""The Karate Kid."" When I heard that it was going to be remade, I was personally excited because I didn't grow up with the original ""Karate Kid"" movie. I can see however how it might upset some people that someone is messing with one of their childhood memories. I must admit though, I did have mixed feelings when I found out who would be playing the lead roles. I was excited to hear that Jackie Chan was playing Mr. Miyagi, but I was a little worried when I heard that Jaden Smith would be taking on the role of Daniel-san.Read full review at FlicksWorthWatching.com",The Karate Kid
196,Emmanuel_S,The Kung Fu Kid. Also known as The Karate Kid.,3,30 June 2015,"Reviewing this movie was quite an ordeal. I love Jackie Chan but I loathe Jaden Smith. Why you may ask? Well for starters I think he appears to be a spoiled rich daddy's boy. I ought to know I used to be one, not a daddy's boy though! But more of a mummy's boy, and the operative word here is USED TO BE people!! But I digress, let's get back to Jaden Smith shall we? He also happens to be a very poor actor, not financially of course! You know what I mean. Also, he completely lacks on screen charisma, which is important if you want to be a superstar like daddy. To be fair, Jaden is early in his movie career; Hence improvements in his acting abilities are possible. But, let's get back to the actual review of the movie otherwise this is going to turn out more like a personal vendetta against Jaden Smith than a constructive, well-thought out and objective review; You know like most of my reviews. The movie title is completely inadequate!!! It is called The Karate Kid, when, in point of fact, it should be called the Kung Fu Kid. Indeed, there isn't even any Karate being performed in this movie by anyone. Moreover, parts of this remake were almost taken verbatim from the Original and duplicated into the plot of the 2010 version. How juvenile!! What about the ending? More precisely the special and final Martial Art move giving our protagonist his Victory: In the 1984 version it is called the Crane Kick, as Daniel witnesses Mr Miyagi performing it on a stomp at the beach. A little bit of movie trivia for you, the Crane kick was actually done by Darryl Vidal passing as Pat Morita, and the name of the kick was Darryl's idea too. For your information, Darry Vidal plays the second semi-finalist who opposes William Zabka(Johnny) during the Karate competition in the original. He really is a skillful Martial Artist. But, I digress, again! So let's get back to my initial point, shall we? The victory kick in the original is real. No CGI, no stunt double there!! Granted it isn't a very impressive move and is only a front kick, it nevertheless became part of our Pop Culture and iconic in many ways. In the remake, the victory kick was not real, the whole persona of Dre Parker (Jaden Smith) was computer generated whilst doing the kick. In spite of him having been given a rigorous Kung Fu training by Jackie Chan himself, before and during filming. To finish off on a positive note, the only two small redeeming factors of the movie were Jackie Chan's performance as Mr Han, which was quite versatile and showed off his true acting abilities nicely. Let's not forget the beauty of the On location scenes in China, that were shot breathtakingly may I add in closing.",The Karate Kid
197,cgraves04,"Good Lord, stop comparing it to the original",10,3 June 2013,"Let me say first off, I hesitated to see this movie because as a child I wasn't a fan of the original Karate Kid, and I thought this one would be just like it. The original really didn't appeal to me. I mean, it's about an Italian kid who doesn't fit in among some WASPs in California, and some kids, like me, found that more than just a little cheesy. Sorry to say it.But this version is a really excellent movie for kids today. It's not for nostalgic adults, and I'm surprised that so many people seem to think it was made for them. (Actually, my main problem with the movie is the title. I think they should have just called it the Kung Fu Kid. Then it wouldn't be kind of a slap in the face to Chinese culture, and it could function as the first installation in the next generation of children's martial arts movies without getting nostalgic peoples' panties in a knot.) What I personally love most about this film were the decisions to a) cast people of color as the leads and b) set the film in China. Hollywood is notorious for its exclusion of actors of color, so to see a mainstream film with black and Asian actors in the main roles was like a breath of fresh air. Even though it's pretty obvious that racism plays a role in how Jaden Smith's character is received by some of the boys in his new neighborhood in China, it was handled with the kind of subtlety I thought was necessary for a semi-lighthearted children's film. And while I recognize that every aspect of Chinese culture portrayed isn't entirely accurate, the scenery was gorgeous, and I found myself pausing the film a few times to look stuff up on Google and marvel at a culture that I know very little about. I think it's nice for kids to get a taste of various people and cultures, and this movie was as much a learning experience as it was entertaining.Aside from that, the acting is, for the most part, of the quality you would expect for a film geared towards children, but the writing was surprisingly well-done for such a simple, typical storyline. I laughed, I cried, and I was taken back to when I was an awkward twelve-year-old. The action was convincing and exciting, and I was extremely impressed that Jaden Smith did most of his own stunts (in addition to being a super funny and charming kid).If you want to watch the old Karate Kid, then that's what you should do. Remakes aren't usually supposed to be shot-for-shot like the original. They have a new context and a new audience, and I think this Karate Kid was a solid film for a new generation. I found it to be colorful, suspenseful, and touching, and I'm giving it 10 out of 10 despite its flaws to counterbalance the adults who I think judged it unfairly.",The Karate Kid
198,pcongleton-1,Wow. What a surprise! This was great!,10,20 June 2010,"When I first heard of this film being made I got really nervous. I felt there was no way they could pull this off. I am a big Jackie Chan fan, but he is 56 years old now and he could be looked upon as being a fading star. Well, I couldn't have been more wrong. I was really surprised by this film. It was great and Jackie shows some really great acting chops. He gave Pat Morita a run for his money. Jaden Smith put on a performance like he had been doing this for a long time. He definitely was channeling his father in this film and that was a good thing. You could hear the Will Smith sarcasm seeping through with Jaden's lines. The film-makers made sure not to copy the original film, but they made sure to honor it. Instead of the main plot arc revolving around Karate and taking place in Los Angeles with an aging Japanese Karate instructor and a valley girl girlfriend, this film moves us to China to learn Kung Fu with an aging Chinese Kung Fu instructor and a talented Chinese violinist girlfriend. They kept the original title so to honor it. I mean, come on, The Kung Fu Kid? Doesn't sound right, but you do not care about that as this film methodically takes us through the story of a young boy in a strange new land just trying to fit in.They stay true to all the Karate Kid traditions such as ""wax on, wax off"". In this film it is ""shirt on, shirt off"". They made sure to utilize Jackie's fighting abilities and acrobatics by giving him a fight scene. I was worried that wouldn't happen and that would have been a bad move. To not utilize what made Jackie great would have been a waste, but this film doesn't disappoint, plus they don't over-do-it. One fight is all we need. They also made sure to honor a Jackie Chan staple. Jackie traditionally loved showing bloopers during the end credits of all his films and the producers of this film honor that wish by showing production stills at the end of this film. The friendship between the boy and the man that arises out of the script is totally believable and it is a good message because it shows us that two people from different parts of the world can come together and create an excellent allegiance. It is a contrast to the real world feelings happening today between China and the US. We all can get along if we just try. The film doesn't try to demonize China at all and after seeing some of the great shots of China throughout the film you come away understanding its beauty. A surprise hit indeed.",The Karate Kid
199,GeneR777,It is definitely a remake - and it stands on its own two feet,8,3 June 2010,"Minor spoiler about the story: the story structure of this film is pretty closely modeled after the original. That said, it still is a pretty fun film with some touching moments and laughs along the way. The story is well told, the tone is very consistent and the performances were believable. And the martial arts action in itself was pretty outstanding. Of course, what did you expect? Jackie Chan is in it. To tell you the truth I am a die-hard fan of the original movies (okay, the first two movies. Never saw the third one... but I think I'm okay with saying that) and when I heard about the original being remade two thoughts occurred to me:1.) WHY? (as in ""Why on G-d's green earth would anyone want to remake such a fantastic film that still stands up even today?"") I was to say the least, a bit ""annoyed."" I probably even stamped my feet but I was definitely pretty upset with this idea. 2.) IF IT IS TAKING PLACE IN CHINA WHY ""THE KARATE KID"" AND NOT ""THE KUNG-FU KID"" Okay, this question was and still is a mystery to me, but after seeing how closely this film takes after the original one I figured, ""Okay, I can live with the same title. It's not Karate, it's Kung-Fu and Jaden Smith is NOT Ralph Macchio. But it sort of makes sense to not call it ""THE KUNG-FU KID"" because it's rather unapologetic (it honestly does not need to apologize IMHO) about the fact that it is a remake. If you love the original movie you will probably actually appreciate how well this remake flows. Most of the same plot points are there and it does not take any weird turns in the story to make itself distinct from the original. It simply is a ""Karate Kid"" remake. Period. As far as Kung-Fu goes in this film, did I say it was outstanding? (I think I did, but let's say it again.) The kids (both Jaden Smith, the Chinese kid is his nemesis are pretty tough.) I would not want to mess with those kids in a dark alley... ha ha ha. Yes, I'm safe here on my computer so my chicken-like nature can be expressed. ;) But anyway the martial arts do make the original sort of pale by comparison. And that is a good thing. The movie benefits from it. It's not the same ol' Jackie Chan routine which we have seen him so many times before in other movies... waitaminute. Maybe it is... but it's still pretty outstanding. And Chan's portrayal as Mr. Han is rather awesome. You feel for the guy and as I have probably seen a ridiculous number of Jackie Chan movies over the years I think I can say I think this is one of his best performances. When the original movie came out kids across the US were inspired to take up martial arts -- probably Karate. I am suspecting that this movie will do (surprise surprise) the same thing for kung-fu. Over all I give this an 8 out of 10. I reserve 9's and 10's for films that are pretty epic in scope and which I have probably watched a few dozen times. So an 8's a good indication that this is a solid, fun movie. I hope you go see it with an open mind. If you are a fan of the original movies you will probably enjoy it as much as I did. Sort of a walk down memory lane with some nice thoughtful surprises. If you are new to The Karate Kid, just be prepared to put aside some allowance (if you are young) because you will probably want to start saving up for some kung-fu lessons after the movie.",The Karate Kid
200,mandy-715-527949,Absolutely loved it!,9,10 August 2010,"I totally loved this film. It was well acted by both Jaden Smith and Jacki Chan and the Kung Fu was very good. My husband tells me that the Kung Fu and training was really very accurate apart from a few showboating bits! The acting by young Smith belied his tender age and lets face it, Jacki Chan is a legend in Kung Fu and has to be respected. Some of the scenery showing China at its absolute best was breathtaking and as always makes me want to visit this beautiful country. It was a great feel good story illustrating the age old message that you can stand up to a bully and you need to believe in yourself. I'd watch it again and again and even kids would be fine with it. It was a thoroughly enjoyable watch and I would recommend it to anyone who wanted to leave a movie feeling great.",The Karate Kid
201,jerrybrsc2,Why Do People Hate This Movie?,7,22 February 2012,"Here's my thing, and I know I'll probably get hate for it, but I really don't like the original Karate Kid Movie. It;s just one of those cheesy 80's movies that is so cheesy that I just can't get into it. I do realize that in nearly every movie you have to suspend some disbelief, but in the original version, I can't suspend THAT much disbelief. And when you compare the movies side by side, it does make sense. ORIGINAL: A white kid moves out to California with his mom and gets his ass kicked by another white guy who knows Karate really well and learns it himself from a Chinese man, and then comes back at the end to kick the bully's ass and a host of other white kids. REMAKE: Black kid moves to China with his mom and gets his ass beat by several Chinese kids and learns Kung Fu from a maintenance man and comes back to beat a bunch of Cheiese kids asses and win the tournament and their respect. The reason that I bring up the color and race parallels is because the new plot is much more believable. And I know some of you are saying to yourselves, how is a black kid kicking Asian kid's asses believable? Well, it's believable because we actually see him train and get better and better as the movie plays out. He trains hard core and it shows. In the old version, he buffs a deck and paints a house and by the end he's like a black belt. In the new one, you get the sense that he trains for a while and despite the fact that it's hard going at first, he eventually gets the gist of it and starts to get really good. In the old one it just seemed like he just kinda trained for a while and magically he was amazing at Kung Fu. Now that I've established some parallels and comparisons between the new and the old film, let me talk about the acting. Yeah, I agree that Jaden Smith is not a good actor. Everybody else though was very solid and Smith and Jackie Chan even had some very palpable chemistry. The script is nothing to write home to mother about, as it were, but it gets the job done and, and it's job is to be a fun family movie with some very engaging action scenes in it. It goes without saying that this movie's biggest handicap is it's overshadowing by the original. I however don't like the original that much, and was probably able to enjoy this movie more because of that. Best advice to not be comparing film to film when you watch this movie, is to forget that the original even happened. Overall, not a fantastic movie, but definitely better than people give credit for. I hope you take this review into consideration if you consider seeing the movie of not.",The Karate Kid
202,KingAtor42,An Up And Down Revision That Is Lost In The Middle,6,19 June 2010,"*Warning contains references to minor spoilers* In my opinion, there's only 2 good ways to make a remake. One is to do just a slight modernization on a script and go forward with what is otherwise a near redo. This works great for cult classics that were not blockbusters. Simply tweaking a highly unknown original and adding star power and effects can make for a big hit. But when it comes to previous movies, this could be a huge mistake, such as say the Psycho remake of the '90s. The other option is to do a complete revision. Change setting, events, and motivations but keep the same story. This is probably the ONLY way to go when remaking a time honored favorite and well known movie. For example, how Burton managed to completely turn Alice in Wonderland on its head and still produce a winning vision.The third option is to mix the two. To pay homages to the original and to keep key elements intact but try to tell it in your own way. This is very much hit or miss. Too many intact elements make it feel like a half-hearted direct remake and too few make it feel like you couldn't depart more and produce your own original film.Sadly, this one tries to go for the third option and falls flat as a result.But first let me pay some praise to what they did do write. First of all, Taraji Henson is vastly better as the mother, in some cases providing excellent comic relief as well as dramatic acting. We see a side of her character in this story weakly shown in the original. Also, to his credit, Jaden Smith portrays a better 'Daniel'. Let's face it: the original Machio was a whiney, scrawny loser, his romance with Alli never made sense and Jaden's portrayal is better. At least his youth helps sell some of his unhappiness and manners but he's a tough kid. He takes his licking and still gets up, many times over.The other bonus was a more believable setting. Honestly, a high-schooler moving from Jersey to Seaside California is that stressful? Oh darn! Beaches and beautiful weather versus JERSEY? At least this take moves a black kid from culture friendly Detroit and moves him to China, where his dress, language, and culture are flipped upside down entirely. He is an alien to his surroundings in all forms, including skin color and undertones of racism. His lack or relation to his new surroundings is much better understood.Now, what goes wrong? First of all, Chan's version of a 'Miyagi' is just horribly handled. He is never funny and their new portrayal of a 'tragic past' is far too central to Smith's character and weakly handled. But the worst part is it clings far too close to the original in its plot and doesn't execute what are otherwise key moments. The 'conspicuous training' of Daniel in the original is a billion times better, as was the original 'revelation' scene. 'Miyagi's' haunted past is a mere plot point here.It does so much that the final scenes of the movie are virtually identical, except this movie messes it up. One kudos I will give is they did reinvent the 'crane technique' and made it original if not even MORE predictable, sadly. That point where the Cobra Kai students all realize how messed up their sensei really is? Missing. Seriously, the entire ""Sweep the leg, do you have a problem with that!"" and the eyes of Johnny and his friends in the background is missing. These kids never revolt or learn a lesson. That and the entire ""I need balance"" locker room scene is poorly scripted. They mention balance and then flub a few lines realizing that was NEVER used in the update plot line, and then go on to a weak second excuse. Sadly, like most of the movie, if you could combine the choreography of the update with the acting and lines from the original, this film had a shot at actually being better.Both movies are about a young man transplanted to a new culture and society at a key age of his growth towards manhood. While he finds a fetching young love interest it also draws the notice of a gang of violent youths well trained by a malicious sensei who make his new life a living nightmare. He finds a local handyman who stops the attacks and teaches him 'real' techniques and he repairs his fractured relationships after learning a life lesson from his teacher. He then goes on to face the gang of pugilistic, high kicking oppressors in a grand tournament with nearly identical endings.The problem is that there was some impressive magic in the first film with some scenes and moments and lines that are unforgettable. This remake sincerely loses those key scenes to buffer up other plot elements but they come at a severe cost. There are no classic ""miyagi-isms"" and the best scenes are nothing more than well-choreographed rehashes of the original movie.A great 'self-empowerment' family movie for the Tween crowd but nowhere near as captivating as the original across other demographics.2/4",The Karate Kid
203,Faizan,"Builds on strengths of original while downplaying its weaknesses - overall, a good remake.",6,7 June 2010,"The new Karate Kid doesn't even learn Karate - he learns Kung Fu. That's not the only significant change viewers who adored or grew up on the original from the 80's can expect. The story shifts base from the US to China, a move that embraces 21st Century's globalized view of the world as a shrinking village. This remake does what every good, successful remake should do, builds on the strengths of the original while downplaying its weaknesses.The film belongs to Jaden Smith, the charismatic son of super star Will Smith. You may remember him from his previous forays into acting, including working alongside his father in the touching Pursuit of Happiness. Here he dominates the screen, not only getting first billing but also nearly all of the 140 minute screen time. As a launchpad for a sure-fire career in acting, it is about as good as any he could have hoped for. As Dre, he finds himself the victim of bullying at his new school in Shanghai, where he reluctantly moves to from Detroit after his mother secures a job there. Falling for a pretty girl draws the irk and no doubt envy of the schoolyard bully and his clique. The rest of the setup is as familiar as it is iconic - Dre is helped by the neighbourhood maintenance man, Han (Jackie Chan, exercising some decent acting chops) who saves him from being beaten up but also signs him up for a local Kung Fu tournament where Dre will have to take on the bullies in a final confrontation. Apart from the obvious differences outlined already, the films setup - African American teen in a foreign land - allows it to amplify the situation to Dre's absolute disadvantage. Not only does he not fit in, he doesn't even speak the language and has even more reason to dislike his new home. These smart choices in constructing the films setup differentiate it as more thoughtful than the original, which seems almost dated (though charming) by todays standards. Even the numerous scuffles, from street chases to the final tournament fight, are grittier and more intense and act perhaps as good indicators of how much our collective movie watching culture and appetite for violence has evolved in just a generation. The one key area where the this film trumps the original is the training sessions. Whether being taught self discipline in how to hang his jacket and not leave it thrown on the ground, climbing some very steep stairs on a mountain or practicing at the famed Great Wall, the film benefits from a more convincing montage of scenes that showcase not just Jaden's athleticism but also the adequate chemistry that he shares with his master. The one area where the film doesn't quite break new ground is in the character of Han himself. While Chan is good in the role of Han, he isn't quite as lovable or memorable as Mr. Miyagi. This is no fault of his, for Pat Morita's character was just so novel (if you can discount the Yoda archetype) that he remains almost inimitable. Also bringing the proceedings down somewhat are the elongated running time and the blossoming romance that feels out of place and strangely stretched into full blown love.Whether the film itself will stand the test of time or spawn unnecessary sequels via a lucrative franchise, as studio sharks no doubt hope and pray for, remains to be seen. What is certain is that this is a definite crowd pleasure - an improbable underdog Rocky tale for children - and despite Jaden's limited range in expressions, the overall film manages to leave its mark.",The Karate Kid

205,crow1701,Don't pay attention to the average rating score of this film!,8,28 June 2010,"In the 80's when ""The Karate Kid"" came out, I completely loved that film. Being a teenager at the time, I ""totally"" connected with that movie. However, after seeing the new one, it also stole my heart. Again, the average score on IMDb for this film doesn't represent the heart, depth, and visual images of this film.I'm a guy, and guys don't cry right? NOT! This film had me choking up in three different parts. Without giving away too much of the film, there is a scene when Dre (Jaden Smith) makes an empassioned plea to his girlfriend's father to remain friends. The lines are heartbreaking. I was trying to read them to my daughter and couldn't get through it all. When I got back into the car with my kids, I asked, ""Ok, who cried in the movie?"" expecting them to admit to the tenderness of the film. Surprisingly, they both pointed at me! Kids, they'll sell you out in a second! LOL! The cinematography of the film is outstanding. There are shots that take your breath away. The size of mountains that are shown give you a realistic scope of how big they really are. Some shots give the illusion of you floating, and you really wonder if the camera is hovering in mid-air.My only quibble with the film is Jaden Smith's maturity as an actor. I understand that he is twelve, but compared to other young actors, he has a lot of improvements to make. Some of his line deliveries are wooden. There are scenes where he paces back and forth like an inexperienced actor would do who is full of nervous energy. However, I felt that most of his acting was genuine and heartfelt. Lastly, my daughter wouldn't admit this, only being seven, but I think that Jaden Smith is her first crush on a boy. He's gonna be a heart breaker!",The Karate Kid
206,richnieh,This is not even a copy cat movie.,5,11 August 2010,"I personally think that the movie itself was fine. The set up was pretty new. The idea is partially new and the actors were OK. The story was told pretty well with young girl with her dream and stuff. The movie never had a strong plot any way and the end was rushing pretty ridiculously fast, especially near the end, the little girl is basically non-exited and it makes me wonder why the movie gave her a strong role to begin with.The thing I really hate about this movie is that they are like cutting and paste the old idea and insert them into the movie blindly just on the purpose of making this movie a remake. The fight sequence in the final tournament is almost identical as in the original. The tournament is supposed to be the highlight of the movie but I ended up feeling much stronger when the little girl achieved her dream.I think a remake of a movie should still have some new idea which this movie did a fine job until the most important part of the story. Some of the ideas during the movie were old but it was OK, they could be treated it as a taste of the original. The ending just seemed that they ran out of ideas and did not know what they were doing. Well, at least they did not repeat the crane style the kid was using in the original. The final move was actually quite nice.I don't even know if the fans of original Karate Kid would be appreciated the effort. There was some funny and warm moment that I thought the director and the writer did a good job. They did not do a job to the important plot.By the way, the Karate is not equal to Kung Fu. Even in the original movie, they were not using Karate either. In fact, Kung Fu is originated from China, misusing Karate and thinks all the marshal arts can be categorised as Karate is plain stupid. Well, it is a movie review, not a marshal art contest review. Perhaps it does not matter that much.",The Karate Kid

Jackie Chan was amazing in a totally dramatic role with no kidding around at all. Those reviewers who thought it had a weak plot must not like kung fu movies. Many reviewers seem to be pseudo intellectuals who just don't get martial arts films, and would rather watch movies about ballet dancers or the mentally ill. A Beautiful Mind was so NOT Oscar material: Lord of the Rings was ten times better. Karate Kid was at least as good as Sherlocke Holmes, and it was way better than either Twilight movie.

There was enough heart, culture, mysticism, and kung fu in this movie to win me over.Will this hold true for everyone maybe not. Jackie Chan was a great choice for the mentor to Jaden Smith's character. There's enough new stuff woven into this remake that it does not feel too much like a remake although there are some slight nods to it which if you saw the original you'll recognize those moments. I don't know if there will be a sequel very seldom do remakes get them and the story near the end kind of parallels the near end of the original Pat Morita/Ralph Macchio movie.There are two ways people might feel inclined to view the bullies in this movie. Some may lean toward viewing them as racist. Others will view them as they should be based on the movie's internal logic that they were just abiding by the 3 tenets that their teacher taught them.",The Karate Kid

211,MovieNewsAndUpdates,Wasn't really that bad,7,25 November 2012,"Well, first of all, i have to say that before posting this review, i read quiet a few reviews and most of them had negative opinions about the movie. although i felt the movie was quite good. It was not just about martial arts or kung fu for that matter. There were a lot of things that it focused on like the relationship between a teacher and a student, a mother and her child, transformation of the kid in terms of his behavior and determination. I am not saying that many of these things were not there in the original but i must say the way Jackie Chan trains the kid especially the very first few days is incredible and when you realize how it helps him is great to notice. Few of the locations during the training scenes are awesome and even the way the entire training scenes have been shown in decent intervals. The movie invests a lot of time in building the bond between the teacher and the student. The change of Dre from an amateur fighter to a trained kung fu fighter is also satisfactory. All in all it is a good remake of the first version.",The Karate Kid
212,angelicardour,http://trust-the-dice.blogspot.com/,8,25 July 2014,"This, actually, wasn't the first time I had seen this movie. As a bona- fide child of the 80's, I was in love with the old Karate Kid movies. First Daniel Larusso moved and found a buddy and karate sensei in Mr. Miyagi, then they took the trip to Okinawa, followed by Daniel buying the Bonsai shop for him and finally, Mr. Miyagi found a new student in Julie Pierce – I was there for it all. Needless to say, I went to see this one in the theater when it came out.I was nervous as all hell though. I both dreaded the remake and wished I would see the old ""wax on, wax off"" scene and the final uber kick from when Daniel hurt his knee. Why did I dread it? Because if they had been there, it would have been the same movie and, there-fore, there would be no point for it.Now, don't get me wrong, the plot was the same thing, just with a different script and different actors. With a younger main character, you also find it hitting a younger demographic. If I were thirteen though? I'd be pretending to be a kung-fu master all over my school halls because of this movie. However, there was plenty in there for those of us coming in from the old movies, enough to keep us entertained. The signature scenes were there, but they had different content which made them seem a bit fresher without losing the message for those new to the story.I'm a huge fan of Jackie Chan. I love him in just about everything he does, even if I'm not so fond of the movie. This movie was no exception. He fit into that part so easily I almost wondered if he just goes around in his off time helping out bullied little kids and teaching them kung- fu.As for Jaden Smith, this was the first movie I saw him in and, I have to say it, I can see his father in him. I hope he doesn't just get labeled as some kid riding on his father's coat-tail though, because he's got some serious talent.There were some minor issues I had with the movie, nothing really worth mentioning here – except one. It seems so minor and stupid, but I can't seem to get over it. For a movie called ""The Karate Kid"" there was a distinct and total lack of karate. It was Kung-fu. There's a difference. I shall here-after refer to this movie as ""The Kung-fu Kid.""",The Karate Kid

Another thing that was annoying was the over use of the word 'dude' didn't know you could use it 5 times in the same sentence when you are sober.. well. I did learn one thing from this movie though, the Chinese are extremely violent and accept violence and vandalism as a daily part of life are are cool with it. My advice, don't watch it, its AWFUL.

I saw, and enjoyed, the original, and I have an almost pathological dislike of remakes of perfectly good films. Because they invariably suck.I was wrong on at least two counts.First, and perhaps most important, this is a remake in title only. There is essentially nothing in common with the earlier film of the same name. And second, it's actually a very good film. It combines laughs with pathos, action with some astoundingly beautiful landscapes, a serious message with genuine entertainment. If you're looking for ""The English Patient"" or ""Enter the Dragon"" then you'll be disappointed.

218,sligocait,Amazing remake,10,15 October 2010,"I was blown away by this remake. Jaden Smith is excellent as both a young actor and as an athlete in this film, but it is the performance of Jackie Chan that really amazes. While there are a few small jokes in the movie, Chan plays this one straight, without his usual slapstick persona, and his dramatic ability as an actor in a serious role is touching and utterly believable. The chemistry between student and teacher is as good, if not better, than the 1984 original, perhaps because we're dealing with better actors this time out. Most of the time, remakes are not as good as the original but this was a pleasant surprise. It exceeds the original in every way, and I strongly recommend this movie. If you have not seen the original, don't bother..this movie stands alone and is a better movie in every way.",The Karate Kid
219,paulespie,Seriously disappointed,5,26 July 2010,I loved the original! I know the fighting was silly and unrealistic but in the end it was sweet and good fun.20 years on and I couldn't believe that this one was nothing more than a big budget version of the original with nothing other than spectacular flashy fight scenes and beautiful scenery overpowering the fact that whoever decided to make this had zero imagination whatsoever.If you are going to remake a movie identical to the original then you have to have a reason to do this! A story which has to be updated! Star Wars A New Hope and the so on could be remade using up to date technology but in no way should the movie be changed! They would all need to remain the same. Horror movies which are revamped are basically revamped with gore and blood and thats it..... Karate Kid was a techno advanced version of the first and left me feeling a little robbed! Jaden is quite sweet I suppose but I didn't really like him when I saw him interviewed and the rest can be left up to you guys! If you have the first one and feel like watching this one instead then save your money and put it in the video or DVD player! Snuggle up and enjoy in the comfort and warm bed or living room!,The Karate Kid
220,sanookdee,could have been a lot better.,2,30 June 2011,"With Jackie Chan in the movie, I figured it would be pretty good. But, Jaden Smith is not as convincing as Ralph Maccio was. Perhaps Jaden will be better when he is older. 12 years old is just to young for the physical development it would take to be a Kung Fu champion. Ralph, who was 15-16 in the original, was much more believable. Jaden also mumbles a lot of his lines and it's hard to understand what he is saying. a 12 year old in a romantic relationship just does not really work either.It could have been a lot better with another actor playing the kid. Perhaps Jaden will get better with time. The original will be an American classic, this one, well, I doubt it.",The Karate Kid
221,rach_dll,Mr Miyagi is missing!,5,16 June 2010,"The Karate Kid The Karate kid is a remake of the 1978 film of the same name. Now if you've seen the original, which was good enough to produce 2 sequels, you're going to get disappointed with this particular remake.Dre Parker(Jaden Smith) is a 12 year old boy who lives with her mother in Detroit. But when his mother's job has been transferred to China, his life, it seems, has come to an abrupt halt. On reaching China he almost immediately falls in love with the cute Meiying(Wenwen Han). But with that comes trouble as Cheng(Zhenwei Wang) is Meiying's family friend and probably likes her as well, so he starts bullying little Dre and shows his Kung Fu skills in the process. This leads to a lot of trouble and then enters Mr. Han(Jackie Chan), the maintenance man of the apartment where Dre resides with his mother Sherry Parker(Taraji P. Henson). Dre finds out that Mr. Han is a Kung Fu master and convinces him to teach him some of his moves so that he can kick some ass too. So begins the story of our little Dre who goes on to learn Kung Fu from old Mr. Han, and take part in a grand tournament where he has to face his fear as well as his nemesis. Its completely like the original version but what it lacks is the innocence and the small-time charm of the original.This film is about Kung Fu, its about fights, its about bullying, its about blood, its about survival. Now considering all that, casting a 12 year old boy to deal with all of that is probably the biggest drawback of the film. You don't really expect a kid so young to get into fights where he could really hurt himself serious. So this takes away the authenticity of the injuries and the intensity of the fights. Although the moves shown are pretty awesome but they too are not clear and that should be blamed to the modern cinematography these days which have special effects and quick cuts. Old school style of showing fight scenes is probably still the best, as they look more believable and the moves are readable to the viewer. Jaden Smith starts off pretty dull, he even looks stoned in some scenes in the beginning, he's that slow and expressionless. But as the film progresses so does his acting. You can clearly see glimpses of Will Smith in him, but feel that he's trying a little too hard. He should create his own style rather than copy his dad's which doesn't suit his age. Comparing him to other young actors of today, he is lagging behind a little. Although he did a decent job in The Pursuit of Happiness, his performance in this movie is just about average. He still has a long way to go. But credit has to be given to the fact that he has prepared well for this movie but at times it looks like he has been overworked. I mean a 12 year old boy with a six pack? This is the age when he should be enjoying life, playing games, studying, rather than spending time in the gym.Jackie Chan plays an old, defeated man in the movie who gets a new motive when he meets Dre. He has played his part in the movie. There is nothing too great or too good about it. He has simply done his job. Although Miyagi in the original version was much better than Han in this one. Taraji P. Henson as Sherry Parker is totally ignorable. The humour of the film is below standard and hardly makes you laugh except for an odd fluke here and there. The shooting locations used by the director are pretty nice at times like when he shows Dre and Han practising on The Great Wall of China. The music is alright in bits, nothing to talk about really.A very average film at best. You won;t miss too much if you miss this one! 5/10 Sir Rachit Varma",The Karate Kid
222,alphonsesclessin,The new karate kid,3,17 August 2017,"Hollywood should really stop making remakes of classics and this film is, next to films such as Ben Hur, a great example why. Opposing to other reviewers I don't think the actors can be made responsible for this kind of washout, it's just a poor script put on a story everyone already knows. The only way you could make this kind of remake into a success is by altering the story on key points and that's just what they didn't do.Me myself and I think many with me aren't waiting on old movies remade with today's (better) CGI and poor scripts.",The Karate Kid
223,cazaman,A poor remake,5,6 November 2010,"I decided to watch this one so that my kids could see what we experienced with the original in the 80's. Even though Ralph Machio was moderately annoying even back then, the movies did define an era for many of us. Boy what a disappointment with this remake, on so many levels. Generally speaking, I have to say that the producers were trying so hard to copy the original that many of the scenes seemed 'forced'. Even when they were trying to add a variation, it failed to produce the same conviction. Here is a list of my issues with the film: 1. Jaden Smith is simply too young for the role. Between his meagre acting skills and the odd childhood romance, it just didn't work. 2. Jackie Chan seemed very hollow in this role and lacked his usual spark and enthusiasm. I'd say he missed the mark and the potential this role had for him. The scene where Dre discovers his master's past pain is particularly lame. It didn't pull any emotional strings. 3. Dre's mom was really annoying. 4. The general age group for the kids was too young and forced mature concepts that didn't come off as believable. 5. The producers should have 'made it their own' and deviated further, instead of attempting a sad copy.I don't recommend this film. Go and rent the original if you want to feel the inspiration from a 'coming of age / kung fu / feel good' flick. It didn't even suck my kids in.",The Karate Kid

If you thought that as well, I suggest you don't get your hopes up. The movie, in almost every way possible, is alike to the original Karate Kid.Jaden Smith is a good actor... in other movies. Same with Jackie Chan. And well, most everyone else in the movie.The Karate Kid (2010) was a remake, depending on whether thats what it was aimed for, it was to the very last scene. It was enjoyable, but not great. My problem with it was that it was so long and lacked background to the movie and you're sitting there asking, ""Okay? You mentioned this, and you're never going to bring it up again?"" and then there's the predictability.

226,jordancelticsfan,This film absolutely took me by surprise.,7,29 June 2010,"I wasn't really expecting much when I went to go see remake of one of my favorite films. I thought this would be just another failed remake. By the time the movie was over, I was so pleased and surprised. This film proved me wrong. One of the wonderful things about this movie is the setting. Instead of the main character moving from New York to California in the original, it's Detroit to China in this one, which is a positive. It makes the character seem much more lost in a completely different country, language, and culture. The film is more authentic this way being set in China, because this is after all ''The Karate Kid''. I'm still a little confused why this film is called ''The Karate Kid'', since the film deals with kung fu. Jackie Chan gives a good performance as Mr. Han, replacing Pat Morita's iconic role. And, of course, the young Jaden Smith is a surprisingly good fit replacing Ralph Machhio as the ''The Karate Kid''. The cinematography in the film is very well done. You can compare this with the original. But there are many, many differences in this film that separate it from the original, and somewhat make it it's own. I'm pleased with how the movie turned out.",The Karate Kid
227,Mike_Fen,"A nod to the original, but a stand alone title.",7,30 April 2012,"""The Karate Kid"" was surprisingly original. 2010's Karate Kid, or ""Kung Fu Kid"" (as it should have been called), is a charming story of a young boys journey half-way across the world and his struggles to acclimate himself to a new start in a world he does not know. Although the title refers to Karate (a style of martial arts that traces its roots to Japan), Dre Parker (Jaden Smith) actually learns a variant of Kung Fu. In fact, there is no reference to karate at all in the movie, except for a brief line by Dre's mother (who is corrected by Dre) and by television show the Dre watches (showing martial artist with while kimono style gees and black belts similar to those worn by Daniel in the original Karate Kid movie).Aside from the obvious ( the title), which was used to connect the franchise, this film tells a similar, but completely different story. The characters are recreated with different back stories, different challenges, and different motivations. The story itself, although hinting in subtle nods to the original, presents itself as a stand alone story. In fact, unless you consciously choose to link it to the past films, the film could be seen as completely different franchise.The acting in the film is very good. It is difficult to judge child actors, because most of them haven't developed a true understanding of what they are actually doing (with the exception of those who have an unnatural talent for this art). With that said, the acting is very strong. The children (most of the main cast, at least)show enough emotion and connection to the characters that allows the audience to empathize and relate to them. They show much promise for the future, and quite frankly can out act many adult actors around today - have a seat Mr. Tatum, the kids will take it from here.All in all, it is a very entertaining film, fun for young and old. Despite the misnomer, it is worthy of baring the franchise's cherished title.",The Karate Kid
228,GoodMovieGuy,Great Movie!! Surpasses the original...,8,23 June 2010,"First, I have doubts about the movie. I like Jackie Chan, but his last films with Hollywood is not so great. And Jaden Smith is a rookie. He made a good performance in Pursuit of Happiness, but that's all. His track record is so short. And the director is not convincing either, his films is not my favorite.But I still watched the movie, because it's in the top list of the box office (before Toy Story 3 was released). And my friends recommended it too. And, boy, was I in for a surprise... I was thoroughly entertained throughout the 2-hour duration of the movie. The story, acting, scenery, and the action is blowing my eyes off... All the ruckus about the title is not my concern. It is true that the movie should have the title ""The Kungfu Kid"". But I agree that the title is not very commercial. I like ""The Karate Kid"" better. Jaden Smith is surely can act!! And he is very easy to the eyes. I like to watch him perform. He has so much in common with his father. Especially when he does the smirk and the surprise expression. His kungfu is very believable. I'm sure he worked very hard for it. Jackie Chan is not so bad as a broken man that become a teacher. He could picture that well enough. Although in this film his martial art skills is not used often, but it is acceptable. All in all, this is a very good movie... Very memorable. You should see it.",The Karate Kid
229,logeesp,A decent adaptation in a time where most remakes flopped,7,1 June 2020,"Look, I hate remakes as much as the next guy, but I was pleasantly surprised with 2010's The Karate Kid. Jaden Smith and Jackie Chan had great on-screen chemistry together, and the acting was good. The movie was entertaining, and of course, Jackie Chan was one of the highlights of the film.The fight scenes were entertaining, but my problem is the camera shakes a lot during the fights, making some of the movements very hard to see. I understand shaky camera movements exists to make scenes more intense, but it's not worth watching if I can hardly tell what I'm seeing.Remakes have a reputation for being terrible, but The Karate Kid manages to do a decent job at being a remake, and it's a fun movie for kids and adults to enjoy.

230,Valtresca,Stop Hatin',9,24 November 2010,"First off for those of you that say it shouldn't have been called the Karate Kid, there is a scene where Dre(Jaden Smith's) Mom says something about Karate and Dre gets mad and screams at his mother, ""It's Kung Fun this is China!"" Because as anyone would know who is a fan of Martial Arts movies, Karate is Japanese, and a more direct form of Martial Arts, Tae Kwon Doe is Korean. But I diverse.The main reason the name Karate Kid is accurate is because it took almost every element from the first movie: Culture Shock, Bullying, The unorthodox training methods, of ""kid's"" trainer, The Bond between Teacher and Student, The forbidden relationship between ""kid"" and foreign love interest, The tragic past of the trainer. Nothing all the way to, ""sweep the leg"" was left out but done in a much more sophisticated manner with more believable characters and dramatic dialogue.I'll be honest this movie made me laugh, made me cry and after watching it I feel like I learned something from it too. Kung Fu is in Everything.",The Karate Kid
231,letuotter,A great remake of a classic,7,13 June 2010,"The 1984 Karate Kid is a classic, and for anyone like me who grew up in the 80s, it's more than just that; it's a landmark film that is part of our childhood. However, a truly honest person can admit that, yes, the original (and the sequels... *shudder*) does have its share of flaws. So how does the remake stack up? Actually, fairly well it turns out.The '84 Kid is played by Ralph Macchio, and while he does an okay job portraying the character, he's not a great actor. In his debut star role, Jaden Smith shows considerably more acting savvy. More than that, however, the '10 character is just better written and casted. In the original, Daniel-san (Macchio) is a teenager, but played by a 21 year-old. Granted, he looks young, but at 17, you feel like he has at least some of the tools he needs to avoid being tormented, and with his antisocial behavior, it feels like two teens feuding instead of pure bullying. Dre Parker (Smith), however, is 12, played by an 11 year-old, and he is so much smaller physically than everyone else that you truly feel that he has no chance. He is totally outclassed and can't avoid the confrontation, so he fights back the only such kids can: from a distance. Once he learns martial arts, though, the difference really comes through. While more kids look like Daniel when they sport fight, Dre actually looks like a martial artist. His movements are more fluid and true to the respective art form. Supporting cast is hit-or-miss, though. The Kid's mother goes from a seldom-seen plot-prop to a brash, one-dimensional ham. Dre's mother (Taraji P. Henson) chews every bit of scenery she can find, and looks even more out of place than Dre does. Ali (Elisabeth Shue), the love interest in the original film gets swapped out for Meiying (Wenwen Han), a character who is much better for having her own passions and goals, and significantly less 80's hair. In the original, the nemesis doesn't like Daniel fraternizing with his ex, but in the remake you get Dre running up against the cultural wall of her family and class, and it seems to make more sense. Trading out 84's Mr. Miyagi (Pat Morita) for Mr. Han (Jackie Chan) is an upgrade, but no disrespect to Morita. While Chan has had many serious roles, he has trouble showing believable emotions (to Western audiences, at least), but he makes up for it by driving the hero with calm, Zen approaches and real, fighting skill. Mr. Han just seems cooler, somehow. Maybe it's the flaming mothballs. And while both have past tragedies, Mr. Han's reaction is more visceral and profound. Mr. Miyagi's almost feels like a footnote. The titular Kid's displacement is given an upgrade in the remake. Instead of moving to the Valley, the small family skips an ocean and moves to China. Granted, this is a little silly (Karate isn't Kung Fu, etc., etc, blah, blah), because, you know, she's a single parent from urban Detroit and all, but it's glossed over quickly enough that you don't really pay attention. The added cultural vantage brings a LOT of additional weight to Dre's misery. The language is different, the clothing is different, and the customs are different. You can actually believe that our hero not only feels trapped by his new town, but by entire oceans as well. Most of the movie revolves around training, which most Western audiences think is boring, and most Eastern audiences think is vital. The original film feels more like a Rocky movie, which isn't a coincidence since they had the same director. The music, the actions, and the off-beat training methods are all similar. In the remake, the iconic (and very unrealistic) ""wax on, wax off"" scene is replaced with the equally inane, but more realistic, ""jacket on, jacket off"". The remake brings the feel of Chinese classics such as The 36th Chamber of Shaolin, where our hero not only goes through the torturous training regimen, but also learns the soul of martial arts. The original film seems like the training methods are just used to put fight actions into everyday chores (and get free labor!), while the remake seems more like Mr. Han really believes that kung-fu lives in every action we do. The training montages move from a jetty on the beach and a rowboat to an actual mountain-top monastery and Mr. Han's courtyard, and the scenery gives the remake a HUGE advantage. Aaaaand, the big finale. In the original film, Daniel-san sees the Crane Kick performed, is told ""If do right, no can block"", and spends about half the film trying to learn it, meaning that of COURSE we'll see it in the finale, which brushes aside all the 80's silliness and makes you want to cheer. Dre's special skill comes out of nowhere and is never hinted at or shown beforehand. Both moves are equally stupid in a real fight, though at least Dre's is harder to see coming and can't be defeated by a stiff breeze. In the end, I liked the remake better, though it was full of stupid music and had its share of awkward moments. The climax was given more situational weight, the acting was more believable, the scenery is jaw-dropping instead of just another shot of inner-suburb California, and the martial arts is given more weight and is beautiful to look at. I was disappointed that there were no hidden catch-phrase potentials in the remake, though. I would have given a lot to hear just one muffled ""Give him a body bag, yeah!"" from a bystander. It would have really brought the remake full circle, though it seems to give the original film enough dignity as it is.",The Karate Kid

Jackie Chan (Mr.Han) played the part great too and easily passed off his role.. the part where Mr Han kept telling Dre to pick up his coat put it on and hang it up was brilliant.. this film shows how remakes are to be done.

No one lets u feel fine 4 staying down, & this fight fights 4 ur heart even when u sense the teacher (Jackie Chan) cracking. Jaden willed him on just as Jackie taught him, 2 focus on whats @ hand & nothing else. U have 2 understand as this movie shows, the concentration & countless hours of perfecting simple movements that everything else just works & improvises off of. The base of moves was perfected by something as ingenious of the wax on wax off move from the 1st movie. U truly got 2 c trust one human can have 4 another & the way they can will each other. Best buddy movie of the year so far. This had 2 b the 1st time I've actually teared up @ a fighting movie, Jackie really has true acting talent thats hard 2 find in a fighters who block most things out. I c the evolution of more respectful fighters come out of this movie I hope cause Jaden dealt w his bullies by training harder & smarter. & o course he willed on his school crush 2 crush her competition with her musical. I just hope Taraji gets a role where she gets 2 do a true comedy, she sparked the movies humor like a firecracker u didn't know where it was going 2 go.

234,L_Knight_91,A worthy remake,8,29 June 2010,"When i saw the ""Karate Kid"" posters here and there i had to go and see it, i paid my ticket and entered the theater only to admire Jaden Smith's acting.The story starts out as a Dre Parker(Jaden) and his mother(sherry) moving to China due to a job offer there, Dre dislikes China there at first but sees a girl and has a crush only then problems starts for the young Dre as bullies causes trouble around him, that's when he has to fight his way to prove himself with his master training him(Chan).As a fan of the original Karate Kid series i kinda enjoyed this movie,they got the bully problem,from zero to hero situation,the crush and many other. while the title says ""karate Kid"" and it's Kung Fu in there, i'm willing to pass that and see it again and again,great movie for friends and family.",The Karate Kid
235,amaze-mas-x,Entertaining,8,9 July 2012,"I watched this film recently and I thought it was great. Most people here seem to dislike Haden for some reason thus giving it bad reviews. Others like act cool and say that the classics are the best. I thought Jaden did a pretty good job. Some people said about character development. To be honest if there was any more of that then the film would probably be even longer which would mean people would moan about that again. Hard to please people, right? In the original there's a white guy playing the lead and compared to that I find Jaden better and I'm not black. Overall, I thought it was good. Can be watched with the family. 8 I'm giving due to some repetition.",The Karate Kid
236,TheMovieGal,Jaden Smith shines as the new Karate Kid,8,15 June 2010,"After Jaden Smith completed his role in The Pursuit of Happiness along side his mega-hit father Will Smith, it was assured that Jaden had the chops to join the family business. Jaden's mother is actress Jada Pinkett Smith (currently starring in TNT's ""Hawthorne""). Both parents wanted their son's next major role to fit his abilities and they decided to produce an updated version of The Karate Kid, the smash teen hit in 1984. According to the Smith's, the vision of the film was not complete without securing Jackie Chan to play the role of the boy's mentor and trainer.The Karate Kid, known internationally as The Kung Fu Kid (and perhaps a better title for the film) was shot mostly in China. The plot is identical to the 1984 version: boy moves to strange new town, boy get's bullied, boy get's trained to fight by wise, older martial arts expert, boy seeks revenge and learns many lessons along the way.The Karate Kid, released this weekend , is indeed a film worth viewing even if you are especially fond of the original. It is difficult to remake a film that was as popular as The Karate Kid, but this film accomplishes the task and brings more sophistication to the story than the earlier film. Both of the film's stars do not disappoint. Jaden, believable as the new kid in a strange land, portrays vulnerability when needed and obviously trained for the fighting scenes.Jackie Chan is spot on as the kung fu master and it is a treat to see another side of the actor who normally plays in more comedic films. The Smiths secured an all access pass to China, including a look at the Forbidden City. The cinematography and the film's score were enjoyable and impressive for a film catering to younger viewers and it is nicely cast with Taraji P. Henson portraying the mother and Wenwen Han playing the boy's first love interest.The kung fu scenes are well done but may be too much for smaller children. All in all, this was the perfect movie to be released as school breaks for the summer. It's a film that the target audience will certainly enjoy and their parents will be taken back in time to their first ""Karate Kid"" memories and be glad that their children now have a film of their own.For more film review by Kay Shackleton, click here: http://www.examiner.com/x-53875-Palm-Springs-Film-Industry-Examiner",The Karate Kid
237,lilmzsassie_1,"Not The Karate kid, it should be named Kung fu kid",5,29 March 2018,"This should not be named Karate Kid. However, since I really like Will Smith, this was actually not a bad remake. I agree with the other user below, it's Kung fu and not actually karate. There will NEVER be an actual remake or copy cat of Daniel Larusso...aka Ralph Macchio. Not much action in it, except Jackie Chan, and Jaden Smith being taught how to fight against the bullies and winning in the end. The only move that was done remotely close to the original movie was when he attempted the Crane Technique...Good Try though.",The Karate Kid

The healing thing seems like utter nonsense, the fact that Dre can become a pro at kung fu by picking up his jacket is also nonsensical, the romantic plot between 12 year olds is pretty painful to watch, and what's the motivation for the evil teacher to make his students torturers?

Will smiths son is cast in a film using his dads wages even though it is apparent to many that he can't act. He then meets one of the all time top favorite martial arts actors and ends up taking down a number of ""Kung Fu"" (not Karate) veterans in a matter of 2 weeks.This subject to the poor love story between Will smiths son and the Chinese girl of uptight tiger parents that would never realistically happen despite the corny lines that seem to sway the opposite genders in most films.It has some good elements but wastes its time on trying to be like the first Karate Kid with the overcome your enemies morale and despite its bigger budget was in turn a let down.",The Karate Kid
240,MovieManPat,Finally a decent remake!,7,11 June 2010,"I have to admit, I was prejudiced against The Karate Kid going into the theatre. Any cynic would be. With all the properties that are being remade, rebooted, and re-imagined with such poor results, it's easy to think this update of the 1984 original is just another attempt by Hollywood to destroy your childhood memories. Combine that with the fact that the movie takes place in China, where the protagonist learns KUNG FU, not KARATE, I doubt anyone would argue with you. That's what's so great about this remake: it's actually good. Very good, in fact.The story is pretty much the same as the original, with China as the backdrop instead of Receda, California. Dre Parker (Jaden Smith) moves to China with his mom (Taraji P. Henson) when her company transfers her there. Immediately after arriving in China, Dre meets a pretty young girl named Meiying (Wenwen Han). He then gets the crap kicked out of him by Cheng (played with a vicious glee by Zhenwei Wang). Dre ends up at the same school as the girl and the bully, leading up to several confrontations. Dre gets a little payback after school one day, only to be chased by Cheng and his friends into an ally. Dre is saved from a terrible thrashing by Mr. Han (Jackie Chan), the custodian of his apartment building. Mr Han tries to help Dre by speaking to the the kung fu master (Rongguang Yu) who trains the gang of bullies. Receiving only a challenge to fight, Han agrees to have Dre participate in an upcoming kung fu tournament. Then the training begins, with lots of hanging up coats and trips to mystical Chinese temples. There's even some running on the Great Wall.The original movie is so loved because it had a great story and created a believable inter-generational friendship. Director Harald Zwart has managed to capture the magic of the original and bring it to his version. A lot of credit goes to the actors Chan and Smith. I'm particularly impressed by Smith. I thought he was a whiny little brat in The Day The Earth Stood Still. Here he brings a lot of depth to Dre, making his role as a young boy thrown into a completely different world very real. The scene where he fights with his mother about going home is heart-wrenching. There are times where he channels his father, but for the most part, Smith brings his character to life himself.Chan is great as Mr. Han. This is not the wise-cracking Jackie Chan of Rumble in the Bronx or Operation Condor. Here, Chan plays introspective and quiet, a man carrying a large burden. Zwart lets the relationship between the two develop naturally: the grow closer as the training continues. There is no animosity at first with some cathartic moment that brings them together later. When Mr. Han finally reveals his burden to Dre (his wife and son died in a car accident while he was driving), it's that final hurdle of trust that cements the two together. What Dre does to help relieve Mr. Han's pain (I don't want to spoil it) is absolutely perfect. Zwart captures it all capably.The other thing that impressed me about the movie was the fighting. Zwart shoots it close up, but not so close up you can't see anything. The fight between Han and the gang of bullies is most impressive. Chan is not quite as spry as he used to be, but you see flashes of the old Chan in that scene, with the use of props and getting the bad guys to beat themselves up.The movie is not without its flaws though. The film is long, clocking in at over two hours. While the film moves fairly well, some fat could've been trimmed. The movie also falls prey to corny moments the betray the scenes they appear in. The thing that bothered me the most though, was the use of China as a mystic land. While the film ostensibly tries to stay away from any stereotyping, some does slip in. Mr. Han almost becomes the mystic Chinese helper, especially when he tends to Dre's injuries after the ally fight. Using a form of Chinese medicine called fire-cupping, Han heals Dre almost instantly. Another scene where the two travel to a kung fu temple in the Chinese mountains is also falls prey to this problem. The scene is supposed to enforce the necessity of focus in learning kung fu, but when you seen a woman charming a snake on the side of a cliff, it kind distracts you from what else is going on.The movie has received some flack (perhaps rightly so) because of the title. There is no karate in the movie and is mentioned at one point as part of a joke. I'm a little confused why the filmmakers wouldn't just call it The Kung Fu Kid (that title is being used in China, Japan and South Korea). It does smack of cultural ignorance. It also seems like the producers are trying to cash in on the name. I'm pretty sure the same people who want to see the Karate Kid would go see the Kung Fu Kid, especially since the story is almost identical. But I digress.Leaving the theatre, I have to say I was quite impressed with The Karate Kid. It's perhaps the first movie this summer that offers quality family entertainment (though the language gets a little rough at times). The fights to get pretty brutal at times, so I wouldn't bring anyone too young. But the film is better than most. It doesn't pander and it doesn't preach, it just tells the story, leaving the audience to take from it what they want. I would recommend it to anyone looking for a good movie to see this weekend.",The Karate Kid
241,olympiantem,Enjoyable Take On The Karate Kid,6,7 July 2010,"The Karate Kid stars Jaden Smith and Jackie Chan as the beloved Master and apprentice who train for a martial arts contest where he must defeat his bully and put an end to the embarrassment he has put him through.I thought it was enjoyable, sure the plot was bad, but Still, I felt the chemistry between Chan and Smith. The mom is annoying, it can connect to many children.So Overall many children will enjoy it, some adults who've seen the original might not be so happy but hey, its the 20's, get to the new ages.",The Karate Kid
242,dashopaholic,Loved It!,9,8 November 2010,"Yes, it is another remake of another older, GREAT film. But, I think they did an excellent job. They stayed pretty true to the original while changing the setting (it takes place in China now) and modernizing it a bit. If they hadn't kept up with the times and did a verbatim remake there would be reviewers crying foul. Just as others cry foul if a remake is totally different. You'll never please everyone! That's what makes humanity unique and INTERESTING!I think little Jaden Smith did a GREAT job as well as Jackie Chan! I think Will and Jada better watch out...the youngsters are on the move! I had to laugh because Jaden looks just like his dad! He makes some facial expressions you just have to lol because it is soooo Will Smith! And I just like Jackie Chan movies! Sue me!When I rent a movie (or on the rare occasion I go to a theater) I try to go with no expectations; especially for remakes. I want to have an open mind and allow the people a chance to present their version of it. Sometimes I am disappointed. But most times, I see what they were wanting to achieve with their interpretation of the material. I like the changes they made in this film. It makes it FRESH. Here's my final analysis. Would I spend my hard earned money and add this to my own 250+ DVD collection? Yes, I would add this movie to it and probably will in the near future!

The main actor in the show is so scrawny it's laughable.Mainly a kids show, but I watched it because I grew up with the original KD movies. I like the kid in this but it's like watching Buffy the Vampire Slayer take on all sorts of bad guys and her arms are about the size of my wrist when I was 10. LOL. At least with Buffy you have the magical element of super powers which this show can't rely on. :)I know... I know... size doesn't matter but it also does.. there is only so much a 70lb kid can block, and only so much muscle or technique a kid that size can do with such tiny muscles.Would have been much better if the kid was 16 or 19.

245,snovack,Entertaining and kid-friendly,8,17 June 2010,"Wow...seems like we have a bunch of people all too eager to show their knowledge of martial arts history by heaping scorn on the title. It's a franchise name folks, get over it already. Nobody really cares how many books you've read or how often you watch Ultimate Fighter. That aside, the film's setting in China seemed awkward to me as well in the beginning, but obviously the Chineese Chan being cast as the mentor makes China a better setting. Also, as the story progresses and the philosophy of Kung-Fu is explored a little more deeply, the Chineese setting becomes an integral part of the film. It was very nice seeing Chan play a dramatic role, rather than his usual slapstick (pardon the pun there) comedy roles. Smith obviously was using his father for a model for much of his bearing and demeanor, and I can't say that this is necessarily a bad thing. Chan's ""break down"" scene mirroring Pat Morita's Miyagi drunken mourning if his wife in the internment camps is particularly touching. Overall, an entertaining film that is not animated, yet safe for children - something that is all too rare in Hollywood these days. My 11 year-old daughter thought it was the best movie she'd seen all year. Even better than Hannah Montana! ;-)",The Karate Kid

What happened to the blonde boy who he made friends with when he arrived? What about his dad (only mentioned he died in the first few minutes)?Ultimately, I just didn't feel anything for Dre. One-dimensional, wasn't routing for him, barely likeable, privileged brat. End fight scenes looked so staged it was embarrassing!Silly nonsense only for kids.",The Karate Kid
247,waldwuffel-1,Acceptable movie that does not hold up to its original,5,12 May 2011,"First things first: I have to admit that I am a huge fan of the original Karate Kid, but I'll try and not be biased by that.Short review: The movie is acceptable, with some nice scenes and locations, but the acting is poor and the characters are both full of clichés and underdeveloped.Long review: After seeing this movie in cinema, my first impression was this: Spoiled kid talked his father to get him trained in Kung Fu by Jackie Chan, then made a movie out of it. Jaden Smith just didn't do it for me. His character is just a compilation of afro-American cliché (come on, cornrows? really?), and the movie just failed to develop his character like the original did with Ralph Macchio's. His transformation just didn't seem to be too big, as he never seemed to lack confidence to begin with, and always had that distinct taint of ""gangsta""-attitude (for chrisakes, open your frigging eyes. Looking like you were staring into the sun all the time does NOT make you look cool, just ridiculous). As for Jackie Chan, he was just this: Jackie Chan. Don't get me wrong, I absolutely LOVE Jackie Chan, his action scenes are always superb, and he has got the most contagious smile ever, but there is a reason to it why you don't see him in many serious roles: He is not a good actor when it comes to that. ""Mr. Han"" is just flat, and there are light years between his performance and that of Noriyuki Morita in the original, as the latter actually had more than two facial expressions. Now, which style of mentor you prefer is personal taste, and whether you like your fighting sequences flashy or more down to earth, but in a movie where the lead supposedly learns ""real kung fu"", fighting scenes like those performed by Chan or the final tournament just feel like what they are: staged, choreographed movie scenes. Especially the final bout between Dre and the ""bad guy"" (who is, again, as subtle as a jackhammer, and has ""villain"" written all over him the moment you see him), where you can plainly see that Dre is not performing his finishing move without mechanical help, it boils down to what I mentioned before: Jaden wants to look like a cool Kung Fu fighter, and daddy helps him.As a last note, I really like to point out that I don't wanna see a ""love story"" between two characters who are supposed to be 12 years of age (and as an interesting side-note: I was perfectly aware that Wenwen Han, the female lead, was much older than Jaden Smith when I saw the movie, and I find that not only offensive but truly disgusting to have a 14 to 15 year old girl perform ""love scenes"" with a 12 year old kid).The movie gets 4 out of 10 from me, with a -1 star penalty for being called ""The Karate Kid"". I am aware that Jaden is mockingly called ""Karate Kid"", but essentially, this boils down to: You learned Karate, which sucks, now you have to learn a ""real"" martial art. And as a practitioner of both Karate and Chinese martial arts (Wing Tsun), I find this whole ""my martial art is better than yours"" attitude in general both absurd and ridiculous.",The Karate Kid
248,theoneis,Jaden Smith couldn't act sick if he had the flu.,1,15 June 2010,"First and foremost I failed to see any level of charm or charisma in Jaden Smith. For the first part of the film I thought it was a little girl not knowing who the actor was. I don't believe that if it were not for his father he wouldn't be trying to acting.The only saving grace I found in this film was Jackie Chan who did a fair job, but very possibly could have added much more to the film had he been allowed to be funny.The stunts were very good as they appeared to be done by very competent stunt people.The story line didn't seem to hold the same charm of the original such as the wax on and wax off. The coat, come on that was as bad a joke as could be done to parody the original.Ralph Macchio and Pat Morita were cute and charming, but compared to what I watched in this version they should be getting Oscars. Not many remakes shine better than the originals and this one is no different, except that it does much to make the original look like a super nova.",The Karate Kid
249,stlmbrsn,Very good!,8,11 June 2010,"I saw the movie this afternoon and I was surprised to find myself clapping as the credits rolled. Jaden Smith played the 12-year-old Dre Parker, a young boy from Detriot. Dre (Smith) moves to China with his mother (played by Taraji P. Henson). Dre is bullied by students at his new school, who are skilled in martial arts. Dre decides to learn kung fu to defend himself. He ""doesn't want to be scared anymore"". Dre meets the maintenance man, Mr. Han (Jackie Chan) when Han saves him during a confrontation with the bullies. Mr. Han soon decides to teach Dre the art of kung fu. Towards the beginning of the movie, Dre (Smith) and his mother (Henson) have an argument in which Smith must become emotional. Smith displays acting skills beyond his 12 years. He portrayed himself as a very literate and promising young man. I look forward to seeing where life takes him next. This scene and another scene later in the movie (SPOILER!!!: with Chan explaining the death of his wife and son) show great promise for a future in the film industry. His parents should be very proud of his performance! As for Jackie Chan, this was one of his best performances. He showed great emotion in the film, including during the scene described above. He was very convincing as the martial arts master. Chan and Smith had fantastic chemistry on camera. The other characters in the film such as Smith's love interest, played by Wenwen Han, and the bullies were good as well. Overall, the movie was inspirational and a great summer film. In the end, the other people in my theater joined me in applauding the film and its actors. :} 8/10",The Karate Kid
250,cliffgold-1,No wax-on wax-off but this Karate Kid would make Mr. Miyagi proud,9,13 June 2010,"Over the years, I have taken a lot of grief from friends for making The Karate Kid, the 1984 movie directed by Rocky Oscar winner John G. Avildsen, one of my five favorite movies of all time. So it was with apprehension and low expectations that I went to see the remake.Wow, what a magnificent job of re-creating the first film while modernizing it, setting it in China, and bringing all the tension, man-love, and depth back to the big screen. This time, Dutch director Harald Zwart added wonderful scenic views of China and lost a bit of the sometimes-cheesy dialog. But to his credit, he kept a great deal of the original plot intact. Mom is transferred to Beijing and takes her son with her without much worrying about his feelings. Dre immediately finds trouble as the American outsider who befriends the beautiful Chinese girl. There is the evil sensei of the trained-to-maim thugs who rule the school that our hero, Dre Parker (Jaden Smith), has been thrown into. The bad kids target him, and he gets the heck beat out of him.To the rescue comes the maintenance guy in the apartment building in which he lives. Played by Jackie Chan, Mr. Han isn't quite as sage as Mr. Miyagi but he uses almost the same technique (not exactly wax-on-wax-off, paint-the-fence, and sand-the-floor but close). His personal secret remains essentially intact, too, which when discovered by Dre, motivates him to work harder. The role of Dre's mom, played here by Oscar nominee Taraji P. Henson (The Curious Case of Benjamin Button), is beefed up from the part that Randee Heller played in the original. The young girl, Meiying (Wanwan Han in her first role), looks vaguely like Tamlyn Tomita, who played the love interest in The Karate Kid: Part 2. The rest of the film plays close to the original as well but I won't tell you if he wins (as Daniel LaRusso did in the original) or loses (as Rocky did).Jaden Smith proves that he may be a force in the business for a long time. His parents, of course, are Will Smith and Jada Pinkett Smith, and they have created a natural. That was evident in The Pursuit of Happiness. Hand it to the kid: he worked really hard to learn kung fu (it's not karate). And while I preferred Ralph Macchio because he was so raw and not talented as an actor, Jaden Smith knows the camera is always there, which I think he will grow out of over time. Jackie Chan is really quite good here, shedding the recent tongue-in-cheek comedy roles. This part fits him perfectly and Morita would have been proud had he lived to see it.After my disappointments with so many other remakes, I was pleasantly surprised. The director and cast clearly found the balance.",The Karate Kid

253,peaceandcalm,A good remake,10,30 August 2010,"It looks like the haters are out in full force with their reviews and messages. What is a remake supposed to be? It keeps the same overall storyline and adjusts to a new time in history. Those who loved the original can obviously relate to the remake. Other than plot, there are some massive differences. That is to be expected. However, it is not fair to judge this remake to the standards of the original.Number one, location. This is not a cross country move as in the original. It's a culture shock move half way around the world for Dre Parker and his mother. Already a huge departure. Imagine being a single parent of a 12 year old boy. Now imagine moving to a place that is mostly alien to the both of you. No understanding of the culture or language. An intimidating and scary situation if you can put yourself into it.Number two, anger. As in the original, the karate kid is having lots of trouble adjusting and wants to go back. In his situation, who would not want to go back to where things make sense? Being forced to accept the new environment would be a nightmare. Remember, the new environment is another country and culture, not simply east coast to west coast of the United States. Number three, motivation. Dre meets Mr. Han and following the original plot, begins training him not in karate, but kung fu. Dre is motivated in the same way and learns the essence of his mentor's art. I must say, the fight choreography is vastly improved! Whether they were using a stunt double or not I am still very impressed.Last, redemption and respect. If you are expecting something other than you saw in the original, you will be disappointed. Dre impressively uses the art Mr. Han has taught him to make some amazing fight sequences. A great re-telling in my opinion. Whoever is behind the lower ratings, what's the deal? What did you expect? Daniel LaRusso goes through the same thing that Dre Parker does it's simply on a more global scale. Maybe you have some bias against filming in China or casting a black mother and son. Possibly you think Jaden's acting is his first lead role is bad. Whatever your case, it is faithful to the original and what else can you ask of a remake?",The Karate Kid
254,kathy84,"It's ok, but",5,22 July 2019,"This remake is an ok movie and all right to watch if there's not much on tv. But the quality of the originals just isn't there in my opinion, and it's not as watchable or enjoyable as the original ones. It really should've had some more differences and a different title, then its legacy of essentially nullifying all the previous Karate Kid movies wouldn't have happened probably. Because it did so well at the box office, this movie's legacy is making it as if the previous Karate Kid movies never existed. You never see any of them on tv anymore, and they're much tougher to find new on dvd. Tough to get used to this being the only Karate Kid movie ever seen anymore but that's how it will always be now. The original Karate Kid movies (even the next Karate Kid) don't deserve that because they were really well made but that's what they've gotten in more recent years because of this remake.

The target audience is young children to early teens. My son has no patience when there are subs, he begged to go see the show and lost interest in the show when the subs started. He enjoyed the fight scenes, some of the training and some of the cool places, his words. The show should have been in English, accented but English. This relates as well to my first gripe.I enjoyed the show and don't feel it was a waste of time entirely, why my score of 6/10.The main characters acting was poor in places but was passable as the story was a bit disjointed as well. Lots of time was wasted and the plot wasn't fleshed out well with jumps in the plot with no corresponding description or explanation.The story is a re-make of the original, in which about 2/3 of the original plot remains with no explanation for the jumps in the sequence and almost nothing added to the story.I can see what they wanted to do but too much is missing or is there with no explanation or reason. Mabey an unedited version will be released that fills in the plot line. Poor editing can kill any good story.I recommend seeing the movie, just... The fight scenes and sets are top notch. The story, acting (in places) and age of the actors is the killer.",The Karate Kid

262,billandbonnie,This remake represents the highest form of flattery,9,19 June 2010,"The old adage says that ""imitation is the highest form of flattery"". But there is a form of flattery that represents an even greater art - imitation which results in a superior product than the original. So it was with Mozart's aping of Haydn's symphonies - he took a form stylized by a predecessor and made it better. So it is with this ""Karate Kid"" movie. The original, while seldom proclaimed a ""great"" movie by critics, was nonetheless a good story told with style and depth - hence its success and longevity. Its immediate successors (sequels) were good entertainment but never reached the apex of the original. However, this movie is in many ways better than the original ""Karate Kid"". I believe that most likely this is because a much larger budget and more creative people were involved in this project. I am not afraid of giving away information that would consider ""spoiling"" because I believe that most people seeing this film have already seen the original - who hasn't? The entire story line is represented point by point - young boy is uprooted from his home with only his mother and gets his ass kicked by older boys who are tutored by a vindictive merciless instructor who encourages their bullying. The young boy is in turn mentored by an unassuming martial arts master who reveals the mysteries of the Orient as well as martial arts prowess. In the grand finale, young boy kicks ass himself and, against great odds and unfair play, wins the tournament - and his self respect (and the girl). Even the same subplots and back story are there - tragedy in the life of the mentor and a love interest for the young boy. Major plot lines of the original are kept intact, some almost verbatim;the boy is set upon by several young hooligans and saved by the mysterious older master, the malevolent opposing martial arts instructor attempts to win the tournament by foul play (""Sweep the leg"" in the original and ""Break his leg"" in this remake). One part that does not work as well in this remake is Mr Han's drunken episode compared to the same sequence in the original that almost won Pat Morita an Oscar. One reason I think that this film works better than the original is that it is set IN the Orient,emphasizing the ""stranger in a strange land"" emotions of the young boy. Jada Smith plays the part of the young boy on a consistently cooler level than Ralph Macchio did - and he's prettier too. But ""The Karate Kid"" was a good story to begin with, and greater talent and a greater budget (beautiful cinematography of Chinese landmarks and displays of Asian culture and people) make this a much better film.",The Karate Kid

The second reason is China and Beijing.The film is made there and the scenery is real.The third reason are the kid-actors and especially Jaden Smith.I have not seen him in other films and when I saw the movie for first I did not know that he is Will Smith's son.He has a talent for sure.With all the filming tricks this boy has trained a lot to perform the role and deserves applause.The music is making the film complete.There are ""goofs"" in the film of course,but none of them is important.The actors play so well,so you forget that this is a film.",The Karate Kid
264,nativecodder,90% carbon copy of the original Karate Kid,5,5 July 2010,"I waited several weeks before going to see this film. I read some of the comments on this site regarding the film, but tried not to allow them to cloud my judgement while viewing this film.In a nutshell, 90% of this film is nothing more than a carbon copy of the original 1984 film. It's just set in China instead of California. The characters were the same, just different names. Dre instead of Daniel, Mr. Han instead of Mr. Miyagi, Dre's girlfriend instead of Ali etc. etc. You could have just as easily had Martin Kove play the role of the evil Kung Fu instructor, in fact, I think the guy playing the role watched Martin Kove and just imitated him. Those scenes and dialogue in the kung fu studio were pretty much word for word from 1984. Most of the scenes in fact, were just duplicates. Jackie Chan stated he wasn't Miyagi, yet I was sitting there thinking he's just a younger version of what Pat Morita was doing. If you know the original movie, then there is nothing new here offered.I also had a problem with the age of the boys. They really should have been 15 at least, to have cast such a young group of actors just didn't have the right feel to this film. 15 year olds you could see behaving this way towards others, not so much these 12 year old kids.I didn't hate the movie, but didn't love it either. It was simply average or OK. Hey I've got an idea for a sequel.

269,edwardtom9,Surprisingly Good!,6,11 September 2010,"I went into this film with fairly low expectations, being a huge fan of the original, I naturally thought this movie would be terrible. I went into the film trying not to compare to the original so I would get a completely fresh view on it.I found this extremely hard to do for the first 30 minutes not because of differences from the original but because of it's similarities, it was basically exactly the same, the only differences being the actors had changed and setting had changed. This is probably one of the biggest flaws with the film.The other problem I had with it was the 'subtle' exposition. They tried to hide their exposition subtly inside the dialogue which is a big mistake, they treat the audience like we're idiots to some extend, like we need information served to us. I know this film is primarily aimed towards kids, but kids are quite perceptive to emotions (see Pixar films like Wall-e for example), the film could easily use the ""show don't tell"" rule.Now to get to the positives, Jackie Chan was great! He really hits the right notes for his character, he may not be Mr. Miyagi from the original,but that doesn't matter since he's not Mr. Miyagi, he's Mr. Han. Jackie Chan did a brilliant job in his big drama scene, but I don't want to spoil too much.And the score was great; it had a very epic feeling and when necessary was downplayed to underscore the emotional content. But nothing less is expected from James Horner.Overall the film was quite good. As I said it would be a lot better if the start wasn't so similar to the original After the start, the story was captivating and it kept me hooked which was great, they hit the emotional beats well most of the time and I loved the inspirational scenes for example right after Jackie Chan's big drama scene they begin having the training session seen through shadows on the wall which I must admit I got a bit choked up about hahahahaha.The cinematography was great, they really utilized the beautiful Chinese landscapes to the full of their ability, not only have they created beautiful images to look at, but they've created an aesthetic or atmosphere, something that makes us feel like we've experienced what we're seeing, a fantastic device to draw audiences into the film and something that is not often seen in modern movies.Not as good as the original but still a great effort, especially for a remake, I'm impressed! 6/10",The Karate Kid

The Kung Fu Kid (this title is officially renamed by me) is a charming film with rich culture and character.The backdrop of China is visually stunning and gives kids watching the film an appreciation of the World that is so often lost in the isolation of America. I watched this film with a 6, 9, 11, & 12 year olds and they all wanted to pack their bags for China by the end.3. Jayden Smith=daddy jr. Which works!

It's like the writers and producers said ""well there's kicking and punching right?, the clueless audience won't know the difference, it's all gooks flying around in pajamas right? snort"" What does this film have to do with karate? why would Chinese in china practice it? (not in this film mind you) if you are going to cash in on a memorable movie franchise at least have a clue to the significance of the title.To illustrate how this movie is at best mildly insulting to Chinese. Imagine:a Hitler movie where Hitler is played by Morgan Freeman (and changed nothing else). George Washington is Played by Donnie Yen. John F Kennedy is played by Mickey Rourke.This isn't because he is black, it's because karate isn't even vaguely Chinese. It's not a simple case of poor casting choices, it shows a blatant disrespect to the story. At best some folks might laugh their asses off at the absurdity, at worst they'd burn down the theater. Seems the plot holes existed on their own and the studio just built a film around them. Who inspired his mom to go to china? Micheal Moore? things so bad in USA she has to work in China?!?! You think it's tough being black in America, try being black in China, a clueless black at that. No uniform. No clue. Two dimensional support characters. One dimensional ""villain?""

273,bryan-r-butler,Not the Karate Kid,7,27 December 2010,"All the reviewer have it right, this is not the original and never will be. ""Wax on, Wax off"" is a phrase used even today by those that know the movie. There are a few things I think reviewers get wrong and thats that this movie is cute for younger and older crowds. If this movie is being used to bolster Jadin's career, who cares. This wouldn't be the first time a child of a Hollywood star gets a kick off with support from the Hollywood parents. Oh by the way, teens can continue to watch vampires eat each other and remove their cloths to show some skin. The original will always be a classic but there is room for an addition. I wouldn't rank the Karate Kid Part II in the top 1000 movies ever made so this makes for a nice addition to the Karate Kid series. The original, based in the U.S. with a Japanese American teaching Karate to an American and this version being based in China with Jackie Chan teaching Kung Fu in China both being true to the art.If you are looking for a cute film to watch with your young ones this is a good one.

Basically the storyline of TKK.Just watched this movie in the theater with the most lamest viewers ever. The moment that Jackie Chan showed himself on the screen, I was the only one clapping.This is how a remake is made. It's fast, brutal and funny. The cinematography is absolutely gorgeous! The fight scenes are brutal. When Jaden gets his a** handed to him, you really feel like he's getting punched and hurt. What I thought was kind of disappointing is that Jackie Chan only had 1 fight scene that lasted for 2 minutes. And the ending... They're just happy that Jaden won... and credits start rolling. (And what you hear is Justin Bieber:P) I thought that they could at least showed what changed his life.

I've been a fan for years, so this was one of the main reasons to watch this film.The fighting scenes were great. Jaden Smith is going to be a force to be reckoned with as he puts in another solid performance. I recommend this movie wholeheartedly.8 out of 10",The Karate Kid
276,themoviemavens,"Allow it to stand on its own merits, and you'll probably come out impressed",8,18 June 2010,"Most people will remember the now iconic 1984 film starring Ralph Macchio and Pat Morita. The title character in the original film was much older – 15 or 16 – probably a more appropriate age for the kind of butt-kicking, swearing, pint-sized romancing the talented Jaden Smith engages in in this super-sized rethinking of the John G. Avildsen-directed original film.While the Karate Kid is at its heart, a film made to appeal to the sensibilities of the 6-13 set, it manages to do a pretty good job of reeling in mature viewers as well. Let me say here that the film's title is a major misnomer. The form of martial arts being practiced here is in fact, Kung Fu, not Karate. How the filmmakers got away with not making a modification to the title of the original film here, I'll never be sure.When Dre Parker arrives in Beijing, he's reticent, but curious about the world around him. He soon sets his sights on a playground PYT, which incites the jealousy, and perhaps racism of a schoolhouse rival. Though race is never directly mentioned in this film, the issue is always present. Racial tensions provide an undercurrent to the filmmakers depiction of an outsider among outsiders. He is initially befriended by a Caucasian boy from the States, who inexplicably, is never seen again. His only real friend is potential love interest, Meiying, a talented violinist who's studying to be admitted to a prestigious arts school.Dre's mother, Sherri Parker, played by the always-entertaining Taraji P. Henson, is strangely aloof and disconnected from the problems Dre is facing. Had director Harold Zwart (Agent Cody Banks, 2003), wanted to add an element of depth and humanity to his work, he may have included at least one scene in which Dre and his mother bonded over their displacement to what must have initially been a very strange land. Instead, Ms. Parker flounces around the apartment, giddily chatting about new foods she's tried and places she's going. Her biggest concern with respect to Dre seems to be getting the youngster to remember to pick his jacket up off the floor.Dre is given a surprising amount of freedom to roam the streets of Beijing, and soon befriends Mr. Han, a maintenance man to whom there is More Than Meets The Eye. Mr. Han takes on the monumental task of getting Dre's Kung Fu skills up to fighting levels. This happens at breakneck speed. Actor Jaden Smith spent the better part of 6 months getting into fighting shape for the film. Dre however, seems to gain sage-level mastery of the most complex Kung Fu skills in just shy of 3 weeks, by my estimation. Good thing, too, because he's soon called upon to challenge his playground rival in a Kung Fu face-off, ostensibly to wind the hand of the winsome Meiying.Mr. Han, played with surprising depth by the age-defying action hero, Jackie Chan, succeeded in drawing me in to the fast as lightening fight scenes, which seemed, at times, to pay their homage more to the Three Stooges than to Bruce Lee. Like most of Chan's fight scenes, they're played more for laughs than for authentic action. This seemed to sit well with the theater full of young children who oo-ed and ah-ed at the gravity-defying stunts performed skillfully by both Chan and Smith. I cringed at the surety that many of them would be attempting these moves on one another before the day was out.I will give this film major points for reinterpreting, rather than remaking the original film. The classic ""Wax on, Wax off"" device is given a major overhaul, but loses none of its effectiveness. The new Karate Kid film tips it hat to the original in ways that will please its adult viewers. There's a great sight gag towards the beginning of the film involving chop sticks that gained lots of laughs from the over-25 crowd. It referenced a scene in the original film that most younger viewers wouldn't have seen.I did find myself questioning the whole premise of the film in 2010. An overly-trusting mother lets her child spend hours of uninterrupted time with a virtual stranger? He takes her son on excursions throughout China, and the mother – reduced to sassy window dressing – thinks nothing of it? The children engage in tournament fighting that can, and does, cause real injury, and the parents do nothing more than cheer enthusiastically from the stands? Emotionally, however, this film had me from the word 'go'. Watching the final fight scenes between the underdog, Dre, and Cheng, the bully, conjured up the same emotions I felt when watching the final scenes of The Black Stallion as a child. If a children's film can bring you to the point that you are actually invested enough in the characters to pay attention to the final fight scene, even knowing how it's going to turn out in the end (it is a children's film after all), I'd say it's done it's job well. For me, Karate Kid was what a remake should be.Downsides: The sometimes graphic fight scenes, and occasional swearing probably should have earned this film a PG-13 rating. The characterization of the adults, particularly Dre's mother, were 2-dimensional and flat.Upsides: This is an impressive film with panoramic vistas, well-choreographed fight scenes, and lots of heart. It was emotionally engaging, and managed to reinterpret the original film without straying too far from what made us fall in love with the story to begin with.Summary: Definitely a must-see for fans of the original film. Younger audiences should enjoy it as well. Go into it with the understanding that it's a kid's film at heart, and you'll probably come out impressed.**** (our of 5*) youtube - themoviemavens",The Karate Kid

Knowing that going in, I can't say I was disappointed. It was a pretty decent film, though definitely not a ""must see"". Some parts, such as Jackie Chan's performance, and action scenes at the end, were great. Some parts, such as a few painful jokes, and Taraji P. Henson's entire character, just made me cringe.

A profound hint of powerful forces that can work through us, when ""we empty our minds"" -- have a passionate teacher (are dedicated, naturally skilled and have a strong focus). Other qualities I appreciated: Heart, strength, the value of courage and compassion, were shown and illuminated -- not to mention some pretty fancy moves! Added to the beauty of China, this version is truly special.Jackie Chan proves very emotive, sensitive and caring about the youngster he trains from the inside out -- and young Jaden Smith is a compelling exponent of this art form.Supporting cast, very nice indeed.

His mom and dad should be ashamed that their child acts this way on and off screen. 
You can definitely tell that Will Smith used Jackie Chan for favors to get this made, the apple doesn't fall far from the tree there and unfortunately you can read that attitude throuout the whole movie and unfortunately the plot does nothing to remedy that behavior, how can it when the parents, writer, producer, director, etc promote that behavior.",The Karate Kid

The story begins with a widower (Taraji P. Henson) and her son, Dre (Jaden Smith), relocating to China for a new job. Dre, predisposed to dislike his new home, quickly finds himself at adolescent war with some of the local children who, unfortunately for Dre, are skilled students of kung fu. Life becomes increasingly concerning for Dre until the maintenance man of his apartment building, Mr. Han (Jackie Chan), reluctantly agrees to teach him kung fu.The performances in this film range from solid to strong. Jaden Smith leads the cast well but the real stand out is Jackie Chan, who produces the performance of his career as the troubled and mysterious Mr. Han. The cinematography is wonderful but what really makes this film work is that nothing is artificial. No character or location is over-beautified, everything is natural. The story is also laced with important messages about right and wrong which will not be missed on children.No doubt, those fans belonging to the original ""Karate Kid"" franchise will find reasons to be dissatisfied. Many complaints have been made about the title itself, as it is kung fu, not karate that is taught (an issue that is acceptably addressed and dealt with in the film).

287,snowbb01,Watchable,8,2 October 2011,"It's a watchable, somewhat enjoyable movie. The story follows the original karate kid's model. Kid gets bullied. Kid learns to fight. Kid kicks ass in the end and wins the girl. There are so many stereotypical things and campy set-ups in this movie that I am able to list them all! Every piece of this movie felt very cautiously designed and pieced together. It felt safe and over-produced to be genuinely inspiring. And, come on, you know the Kid is going to win. So, I suppose this movie simply wanted us to enjoy the ride until you get to the inevitable 'uplifting' ending.This is not to say that the film had no positive points. The ride wasn't too bad. The fighting and training scenes are kind of fun to watch. Jackie Chan's Mr. Han is not nearly as zen and all-knowing as Mr. Miyagi. But that's actually a good thing. Watching him dealing with his own demon while teaching Dre, adds another layer to the very simple story line. It also sets this remake a bit apart from the original. Also gives the story an updated feel. Same applies to making Dre a more sarcastic kid who is trying to cope with the loss of a parent as well as being thrown into a completely different environment. There are some innocently sweet scenes between Dre and the girl. Interaction between Dre and his mom is endearing as well. All of this is trying to add heart to this remake.",The Karate Kid
288,MrsGale,Stands out of the shadow of the original to show its own beautiful inspiring colours!,7,16 July 2010,"First I have to make a confession: I'm a child of the 80's and I've never seen any of the original Karate Kid films. I am familiar of course with the premise of the original, a premise which has been repeated throughout movie history both within the fight genre and kids films to speak to different audiences and generations, thus there is no harm in reworking the story again.For those not familiar with the story, this Karate Kid has had to move with his mother to China as the work in the USA has dried up; speaking no mandarin Dre Parker (Jaden Smith) struggles to adjust to his new home, having run across a bully early on; through the film he learns how to adjust and make good choices, with the help of Mr. Han (Jackie Chan).The film contains some beautiful imagery of China, having been granted permission to film in some rare locations, The Forbidden City was last permitted as a filming location in 1987 for Bertolucci's Last Emperor; as well as some difficult to reach locations the crew had to carry their equipment up Wudang Mountain and the Great Wall of China. These aren't just used as adverts for the Chinese tourist board, but are woven into the film with great depth and meaning, spiritual journeys, forbidden love etc. The cinematography in general throughout the film is well constructed from the outset, the opening sequence easily sets up Dre's history as well as a compare and contrast sequence between Detroit and Beijing.The fight sequences really hit the spot. They are cleverly choreographed so the audience feels the intensity and fever of the fight and yet at the same time light hearted enough to prevent a higher rating and frightening its young audience. The build up of Dre's Wushu training translating the ""put your jacket on and take it off"" routine into Kung Fu forms gives a young viewer a real feeling that this is possible to achieve and will inspire a new generation of kids, teenagers and even their parents to learn martial arts and self defence, whilst various schools new and old will cash in on the popularity this film will surely enjoy.It is often said that films are more about the journey than the destination, and it very much applies to Karate Kid and then some as it is very apparent the journey the cast have taken to reach the end result here. Jaden has clearly put in the same time and effort as Dre does to learn the Kung Fu skills required, and having learnt these skills with Jackie Chan's assistance, the bond between them seen on screen is very honest and real; adding a little touch of magic. Karate Kid stands out of the shadow of the original to show its own beautiful inspiring colours. And for those of you that keep saying ""but it is set in China, it should be called Kung Fu Kid"" Go see the film!",The Karate Kid

292,pcgiddings,WOW Much Worse than I expected,1,2 October 2010,"I didn't watch this movie for a while because I figured that it would be terrible. I though that because it was a movie about Kung Fu, yet they decided to trade in on the popularity of the original Karate Kid. All this movie did was steal scenes from the original so it might bring up some memories of the first. Jackie Chan is a terrible actor, and I hate all his movies. The fight scenes and training are ridiculous. They just speed up the footage and add cheesy sound effects. This had none of the chemistry between characters that the first contained. It wasn't funny like the first. Didn't have a good soundtrack. This movie would have been terrible even if they didn't completely rip off the first. If your going to remake a movie you need to add something to it. Not just make some minor changes. Changes which don't make sense didn't help either. ""jacket on, jacket off"" Come on.

Unlike the first one, you actually see him practise different moves and you see him progress and the story is actually quite believable unlike what the trailer made it out to be.He isn't just some random black kid who came to china to learn Kung-Fu.

294,Mr-Gabriel35,It should be: Kung Fu Kid,4,19 June 2010,"From the previews I knew this movie wasn't going to do justice to the original. I mean, can anything? I wasn't planning on watching it, but my best friend wanted to see it and I gave in. Bad idea. It was a waste of my money. First and foremost, let us point out what a lot of people have already mentioned. Jayden Smith cannot act. Like, at all. I don't care if he's Will Smith's son, it's not like acting is genetic. He was just trying too hard to be funny, and too hard to be serious. It didn't seem natural, like he was in the moment. Just him... acting. Of course, I can't say the same for Jackie Chan. He didn't do much, and that was good! Not that I don't like Jackie Chan, it's just it's good to see him as a trainer for once. I wish he would have fought more, though.Secondly, the plot sucked. I mean, it was a bunch of middle-schoolers flying. Like, I get China is a little crazy on the Kung Fu, but come on! The fighting scene where ""Dre"" is running from the Chinese kids is not that bad of a scene, I'll admit, but it kept occurring to me that these kids are like 10 and 12. Then there's the whole Dre and Chinese girl romance thing. I was falling asleep every time they were together. I mean, you're 12! As someone else on IMDb said, there is no sexual tension! Sure it's family-orientated, but it's uninteresting to the rest.Then the predictability. The friend who dragged me there told me half of the whole movie, and she's never watched it before. It's so boring sitting there knowing what's going to happen. Of course, he was going to win, of course he was going to run faster. Of course Jackie Chan would save him, like, I didn't even have to watch the whole thing to know what was going to happen. Also, a lot of the scenes were pointless. I can see why the movie was so long. I can only imagine if they have an extended version! Dre drinking from the Dragon water or whatever, what did that do? I also didn't understand why Jackie was so reluctant to teach Dre at first. I imagined it had something to do with the crazy trainer, but with all the time they had, never developed a true story. Okay, so he got into an accident and killed his wife and kid... I'm sorry? Like, what does that have to really do with anything? Overall, it wasn't worth watching. Or maybe it's not a movie you'd watch twice, because I sure as hell won't. God forbid they make a sequel.",The Karate Kid

I went with my thirteen year old nephew and let me tell you, it did not disappoint! Jaden Smith's acting was really good and he's is certainly going to be an excellent actor with a few more movies under his belt. The actual kung fu was believable and the story line was believable. From beginning to end, the audience in the movie theater, including myself and my nephew cheered and clapped at various parts of the movie. I was a fan of the original Karate Kid when I was growing up, and this movie has added an new spin to the original which is certainly welcomed. It was well cast and entertaining. I recommend this movie strongly for adults and kids alike",The Karate Kid
299,kurisu-717-137128,A good remake with some minor and ignorable flaws,7,13 August 2010,"The original Karate Kid was a sleeper hit that I loved as a teenager. I still enjoy the original as an adult, so I looked forward to this. I wasn't disappointed overall, but there were some minor flaws that I was able to overlook. In short, the acting saved the day.Since audiences have seen so many more martial arts films over the past few years, it's refreshing to see some really awesome martial arts in this film. The problem is that it's a little too unrealistic. I've seen the Beijing team perform and it's hard to imagine these moves without some editing, particularly towards the end of the film. And Jaden Smith being a master of certain moves in such a short time is more far fetched than the original. Daniel learned some basic blocks and kicks in a few months, here this kid looks like a 10 year Wushu veteran after the same amount of time. There are some other elements that don't make sense if you think about them; how does someone move from projects in Detroit to an international job in Beijing? Don't think about it too much, you might miss the good parts.Jaden Smith's acting is tremendous for a rookie. He plays his role like a pro. He's likable, believable and he doesn't exaggerate. He works well with Jackie Chan, who plays a role that's quite dramatic for him. I'm still a little disappointed with Jackie's character. There is a moment where he seems a little too afraid and weak to be a martial arts master. It's good that they don't make him indestructible but he shouldn't be cowardly. In the original when Mr. Miyagi confronts the Cobra Kai leader there's a tension in the scene that makes everyone wonder who would win the fight. Without revealing too much, in this movie, it's clear who would win.There's one scene that really disappointed me. In the original, Pat Morita got nominated for a scene where he relives the lost memory of his wife dying giving birth while he was serving in the war. It's a great scene because it's based in history. Yet the similar scene in this movie is less believable. Jackie Chan's acting pulls it off, but it just doesn't work as well. And I was disappointed with how that scene ended. Mr. Miyagi didn't state directly that he needed Daniel's friendship, but we in the audience came to that conclusion. In this movie, they spell it out for us.The acting between Smith and Chan, though, save the day. Throughout all of the other exaggerations or parts that just don't make much sense, you look forward to seeing these two work with each other. They carry the movie to the end. It's worth seeing, but for me, once would be enough.",The Karate Kid
300,ninad_th87,A brave and good effort handled with care,7,11 June 2010,"The Karate Kid starts with a 12-year-old named boy Dre (Smith) moving from Detroit,and progressively make his way to emerge as a winner (of a championship).The good thing was he doesn't want to progress for some other person(his friend).He wants to conquer his own fear.For this Mr. Han (Jackie Chan) helps him to improve himself not only int the art(kung fu)but also teaches him to be a good human being.The movie doesn't have a different story line,but its treatment makes it stand tall.Movie is little bit slow at times ,since the focus is on the learnings of the small child and not on the kung fu training.Movie has a strong positive vibe and at times is heroic.Budding star Jaden Smith does very well as Dre. Jackie Chan has nothing to prove,he is already one of the finest known actors across the world and does a brilliant job here.On the technical part Director Harald Zwart did a good job.He stuck with the boy and his journey and not displaying kung fu.James Horner definitely deserves accolades for the very good and energetic music he gave in the movie.Roger Pratt does a spectacular job as cinematographer.Movie should have been edited a bit tight(seems lengthy overall),but current job is not bad.On the whole The karate kid(2010) is definitely worth a watch.",The Karate Kid

The script was not exactly how I thought would be some lines really had no point. The Martial Art fighting was very entertaining , I think that it is one of the best action movies of the year , just my opinion. Jaden Smith was pretty good not great. I think sometimes that they were just holding up a card and him reading the lines , other than that Jackie Chan was absolutely fantastic. I love how he kept the original Pat Morita style of really not caring at the beginning but was crucial in the middle-end. The sets (even though there weren't many ) were really cool , perhaps the Forbidden City , Mr.Hans garden ( training area ) was really nice and simple. So all in all this movie is serious but has a soft and nice side to it which I really liked , So go see it yourself and write what you think.",The Karate Kid

Ahhhh... and Jaden Smith nice try but no, maybe a little more acting classes cause your career is dangerously resembling Will Smith's singing career.The Karate Kid should have just died after Ralph Maccio because no one can pull it off without ending in massive failure. Mr. Miyagi couldn't even save The Next Karate Kid with Hilary Swank that should have given you a clue not to make another one.

However Dre starts to get picked on by a few particular members of the school he goes and starts to get beaten up regularly. On one particular occasion it is 6 vs 1 and Dre is getting badly beaten when Mr Han the local maintenance man (Jackie Chan) comes and fights off the teenagers. Dre takes a instant liking to Mr Han and eventually persuades him to teach him Kung Fu to defend himself, and then begins the epic tale of self discipline and hard work to become great at Kung Fu.In my opinion this beats the original and the modern casting works great.

Actually his children wanted to watch the movie. But after 40 minutes the children couldn't stand anymore so we left. In this remake of Karate Kid starred Jaden Smith the son of a very important American actor (that's how he got the part) and Jackie Chan. The remake is roughly two and half hour and his definitely not comparable even for just a sec with the original one. In the original Karate kid starred Ralph Macchio and the late Pat Morita. The original was a good movie. With a lots of action, drama and love.

Since when has a title ever influenced your opinion of a movie?This movie is an excellent remake of the original. Who knew Jackie Chan could act? Hopefully we see a lot more dramatic parts for him rather than the tongue-in-cheek caricature of an action star that he has become.There are a lot of criticisms of Jaden Smith that I have seen and they are completely unwarranted. His performance at age 10 or 11 is phenomenal. His physical capabilities are a huge plus. There are a few idiots that believe the original was a superior film. Jaden Smith is physically more believable at 11 than Ralph Maccio was at age 23(?).This was enjoyable for the whole family and a pleasant surprise.

In the entire movie there isn't even a single piece of Karate shown, well..except at the very beginning when the kid was trying to follow the Karate video tape.I would categorize this movie as a fantasy movie since the whole story is built up by uncountable absurd pieces. If training Kung Fu by picking up jacket isn't ridiculous enough, how about put a bunch of kids in a ""street fighting gambling arena""? Furthermore, while the kid is almost being beaten the crap out of him, his mother is turning her back on him first, then later screams excitedly...continuously. I just can't imagine that could be the reactions from a sane mother.My 3 points are only for the sake of the hard working kids.

It is the same EXACT story with many scenes that could be viewed side by side with the original and the only real difference would be that they have a better camera in the new version. Jaden Smith is eh as an actor and Chan was really slumming making this movie. I used to think that when an actor went to commercials their career had gone south, but I guess this is the kind of thing they will start doing when they lose it.

313,rijotan,"Not superb, but still way better than the original",7,20 October 2010,"I don't really know why people keep dissing this movie. It's way better than the original in ALL factors. The only reason why the original might be seen as better is because at the time it was made, the original was something new and had a better AWE factor whereas in this one, we already pretty much know what to expect.But putting aside the awe factor, this new movie has better everything. The acting is way better. Although Miyagi feels more sage than Han, Han is definitely more believable, and you are much more drawn to his character. Of course Jackie chan being a martial artist and all, he is more believable as a master here rather than miyagi.And although I'm not a big fan of Dre's spunky attitude in this film, I much prefer it to Macchio's wooden and awkward movements in the original. The relationship between Dre and Han really pulls you in as well. The love/friendship relationship in this movie is more sweet and innocent and a lot less forced as well.The action is also way better, which is expected since this is modern day. But what I liked is that this movie showed a lot more of the training of Dre which showed him really working hard in a much longer span of time - progressing and progressing, such that when he finally fights, he is actually believably good. On a side note: Jaden Smith should continue on his kung fu, he might just become the next huge martial arts actor, judging from the skills he displayed in this film.Of course, cinematically it's beautiful, showcasing breathtaking china.About the only thing I don't like about this movie which I missed in the original is the age of the kids. They play 12 yr old kids. And although the ""bullying"" atmosphere here is much more believable than the old one, I'm having trouble trying to grasp 12 yr old kids as being this brutal or this powerful. I mean cmon, 5-6 12 yr olds think they can take on Jackie Chan? Even I can can cream 6 12 yr old kids without much problem, regardless if they're martial artists. I would have preferred 16 yr old senior high school students, since their skill level would have been much more believable at that age range.So why did I give this movie a 7? Because it wasn't a perfect movie. It's much better than the original (I give the original an honest 4), but it still has a couple loose ends and a few things which could have been done better. But still, one of the better movies of this year.",The Karate Kid
314,batgirlnj-2,We All Loved It,8,12 June 2010,"Having seen all the Karate Kid movies and reading the reviews here, myself and my husband and son took to the theater not knowing what to expect. I must say that all the people who wrote such horribly negative reviews must have been on hallucenogenic drugs.We loved the movie! Yes, it carries over some of the same plot and sayings from the Original movie, but I don't think it negatively affected the movie in any way. So, it was not called The Kung Fu kid....movies are supposed to draw you in with characters you can relate and connect with, give you a plot that keeps your attention and a finale that knocks your socks off. This movie had all of that.I thought Jaden did a superb job as Dre, a normal 12 year old kid who is still unsure of himself, not a cocky, pushy punk like some movies portray pre-teens. You could see emotion in Jaden's eyes portraying the fear of his character. I felt emotions for all of the movies main characters and could tell by the cheering and applause in theater that I wasn't the only one.If you're going to go to a movie to pick apart every scene and analyze and compare with a movie that came out 20 years earlier, then you're going to find fault with this flick. Don't go to see Karate Kid to critique it to the bone, go with your family, sit back and let the movie flow.The movie was a bit long, although I'm not sure what if anything could have been cut from the movie.

318,joshsittre,very good remake,9,5 July 2010,The remake was a pleanst surprise for one the acting was very good. the movie had an unhurried pace the scenery was absoulutley breathtaking and made me want to someday visit China China seems like. now to the movie itself first off jaden smith is hands down a great actor and the supporting cast of characters contribute greatly to the film as well. the actress playing the mom is a hoot Jackie Chan displaying an acting ability I never even knew he had is fantastic and the love interest violin playing girl is great as well the fighting climax is excitinbg as well. Bottom line you should see this film and relive a classic remade it is definitely worth it.,The Karate Kid
319,tizne,what a lame re-make... glad did not pay to watch it.,1,5 August 2010,"I did not see this movie when it first came out in the theaters. I had watched the previews during ""How to train a dragon"" and I thought to myself... wow... pretty insulting to the original Karate Kid. Then, I started to read some reviews saying that it was not that bad, and that Smith was brilliant as the Karate Kid. So, I found myself at the Naval base in San Diego where we have a free movie theater and it happened that they were showing The Karate Kid, so I decided to go and check it out... after all I didn't have to pay for it, right? Anyway, since the movie started it began to look like it was going in the wrong direction. I could pretty much tell what the next line was (having watch the original Karate Kid thousands of times). I got the feeling that the ""writers"" of this movie got really, really lazy and just decide to grab the old script, tweek a thing or two here and there, and throw some Chinese dialogs in there to make it look more ""authentic"". To begin with, Jackie Chan's rendition of Mr. Miyagi was pitiful. Even Pat Morita was funnier than Chan was in this movie. Then, the whole single mother moving the kid to work at her new job... I don't know, it just seemed too obvious. What about the scene of Jackie Chan drunk in the car, remembering his family's death? I guess now a days they couldn't have him offering Smith a drink of alcohol, right? Then the whole ""don't hang out with my daughter cause we are different"".. really? I am not even going to get into the training parts... too easy. What was the straw that broke the camel's back was the whole tournament sequence... OMG! They just took the script from the original movie, translate the villain parts to Chinese and BAM! ready to go! No no no.... shame shame!. It wasn't even disappointing, it was just plain embarrassing.",The Karate Kid
320,Phil210293,A worthy adaptation of the original.,8,10 August 2010,"Right, second review, and this time I've gone for a more conventionally appealing film. I was looking forward to the revival of The Karate Kid, as I had enjoyed the original and its sequel, distant as the memories of it are, having not seen either in quite a while. -PlotWell, it's more or less the same as the original, but with a few vital differences; enough to make it stand alone as a separate film for those who are unfamiliar with the 1984 Karate Kid. One major difference was the move; instead of Jersey to California, Dre Parker, our protagonist, and his mother are forced by her work to up sticks from Detroit to China, bringing with it a refreshing scenery change that transformed this remake for me. The other large change was the switch from learning Karate (of which Dre already has a basic knowledge of) to Kung Fu, which I think is a more visually entertaining martial art. Harald Zwart, the director, chose to aim a little younger with his audience, and pulled it off exceptionally, while still managing to keep all of the messages conveyed by the original. 16/20Cast And CharactersJaden Smith plays Dre, and as I am sure you are all aware, he's Will Smith's son. So, quite a lot to live up to there. And he did well; he had an energy that was likable, though admittedly annoying during a few scenes (having said that, my 13 year old brother is a constant source of irritation, so if anything it added a little realism.) I enjoyed his chemistry with Wenwen Han, who plays his love interest, Meiying (if such a thing exists for 12 year olds). I've heard a lot of criticism about Jaden's performance on the internet, and I say to all those people; you are being far too harsh. The kid is 12 years old. He isn't going to be able to deliver a flawless performance; who can? And until you can do a better job, keep your mouths shut. Jackie Chan played one of the few more serious characters I have seen him in, and I loved his performance. His humour was far drier than his usual comedic roles (though that is to the credit of the writers) and he delivered it well, adding an extra dimension to entertain older viewers in what had the potential to be a childish remake. The bullies, led by Zhenwei Wang, also played their parts well, looking mean enough to avoid being patronising in a film targeted at a younger age group. 17/20SceneryChina is a beautiful place. At least, the part the tourists are supposed to see is, but this delved a little deeper, showing a little of the grime that lives under the surface. The beautiful mountain ranges, the lush flora, the beautiful architecture, the cramped, dirty back alleys, the smoky rooms with old men gambling, it was all here. The building picked to feature as the school is a wonderfully colourful building with the greens and reds, and the ornate sculptures and railings, and is every bit the stereotypical building we conjure up in our heads whenever we think China. The Bird's Nest Olympic Stadium, undoubtedly one of the most beautiful pieces of modern architecture makes a cameo, too, standing skeletal and alien above its surroundings. My favourite, though, has to be the mountain temple. Perched on the top of the mountain, no way up except for a LOT of steps, higgledy-piggledy roofs linking to make a maze of corridors, it holds a fantastic charm that no other building can ever hope to match. I love to see other cultures' interpretations of beauty, and nothing endures the test of time to tell a tale like the architecture of a society. 18/20MusicThe music was wonderful; an enthralling fusion of swelling classical pieces, traditional (I think) oriental music, and the occasional dash of modern song to liven up the moment. Get Low and Poker Face were used effectively in their scene, but the haunting string pieces are truly moving; enough to send a chill down the spine and cause Goosebumps, even in parts not meant to be particularly emotional. They added another dimension to the film; another layer in what was already a pretty yummy cake. 17/20OverallI think that, as remakes go, this was one of the better ones. It kept true enough to the original, but put enough distance between them for it to stand on its own two feet, and not ride on the merits of its predecessor. The cast were generally well chosen, the plot was kept simple and down to earth, and generally it felt very relatable in the messages it was sending; anyone who doesn't know how it feels to be alienated in a strange place needs a dose of the real world. It came together very well for me 16/20Summarising, I think that both the film and Jaden Smith shared a lot in common. Daddy's a big star, got a hell of a lot of expectations to live up to; screw it up and no one is going to look at you again. And at the end of it all, they did it; they stumbled a couple of times, but they never dropped the ball, and they brought something a little bit new to the table in the process. 84/100",The Karate Kid
321,chosenbygod-2,"Pretty Decent, But Not Phenomenal!",8,21 November 2010,"Hello,I am watching the Karate Kid 2010 remake right now, and while this movie isn't Phenomenal, it's still pretty OK. Unlike the original Karate Kid which had peppiness, priceless one-liners and a bit on the comedy side, this remake shows a more dramatic, serious side. That being said, you can label this movie in two ways: If labeled as a remake of the original, it's nowhere near as good. I mean for a remake it is very good. But very few movies are as good or better than original ones. But now, if not labeled or considered to be a remake, which based on the comedic-dramatic difference between the two can easily be done, this movie is outstanding Jackie Chan plays his role to perfection, and it is Very Nice to see him in a more dramatized, serious role for a change rather than the funny but cheesy comedy roles he has normally played.Now, I hate to admit it, and while he is definitely no peppy, adrenaline-toned Ralph Macchio, Jaden Smith does a surprisingly wonderful job as Dre Parker, the picked-on kid that needs to be taught not just karate, or kung-fu in this movie, but also manners and better respect towards his Mom. Ole Ralph Macchio aka Daniel Laruso didn't have that disrespectfulness issue.Summing this up, I gave this movie 8 stars because while the storyline and title consider it and gives it the remake marking, the scenery, seriousness, and dramatics definitely could also warrant it to be an original movie all its own. Thanks for reading!",The Karate Kid
322,eden188,Don't compare it to the original!!,10,4 September 2010,"I don't normally write comments/reviews about movies, but I thought I add my piece to justify this movie. I know 10 is a bit high, but it's just to balance out the low ratings (1?!?!) that others have given.The movie certainly doesn't deserve a full 10, I would give an 8 or even a 9 maybe. I thought Jaden Smith's acting was good, very talented for his age. I have always been a Jackie Chan fan, but his recent movies have been a bit of a let down, however, he played very well in this movie.Anyway, I'm rubbish with writing review, go and see for yourself. Don't compare this with the original (which tbh, I was never really keen on). This is a movie that you will enjoy the story, the visual that captures China beautiful scenery and a pleasantly surprised (talented) casts. One of the best movie that I have seen this year.This will definitely be on my BD collection (pre-ordered). Well worth the money.",The Karate Kid
323,marcuswilliams100,I lived in Japan as young black kid.,9,3 January 2011,"I found this movie to be very down to home. If you have ever lived abroad as a kid, at times it can be very scary. To be lonely and isolated in a strange country when cannot speak the language is a fearful thing. Although his mom loved him, she should have prepared him. But he did find a friend and a mentor. They accepted him. I felt this movie should be shone to kids no matter where you move too. Kids should know that no matter where you live, there will always be someone there to challenge you and you must learn to deal with it. Courage,strength,perseverance, and love is what this movie is about. Integrating some of the original movie scenes, this new movie has a certain unique and dramatic flair. I recommend this move to all young people.",The Karate Kid
324,llcwedzi,Satisfactory,8,17 July 2010,When i went to watch this i didn't expect much and assumed i was going to be comparing it to the original. After sitting through the movie i can safely say it is a movie on its own and does not deserve to be compared.Jackie Chan does an excellent job of supporting the upcoming Jaiden Smith and the characters they play ( Dre and Mr Han) do grow on you and do have their stories behind them.Overall i do believe this is a movie worth paying £6 to go watch at the cinema and leaves you feeling satisfied and surprised with movie.

325,RealRonin,At best a movie to watch when nothing else is on!,2,11 January 2011,Firstly I have watched the original movie with Ralph Macchio and Pat Morrita (RIP) who had great screen presence and fitted into their roles like bread and butter.The title is incorrect as Jackie Chan teaches the boy Kung Fu not karate! The film is based in China which is great with locations such as the Chinese Wall which is the only 'Wonder' in this movie! Mr Smith has launched his sons acting career by putting him into a very bold role which he does not pull off due to his age (too young.The training montages do not work and the teaching style is not realistic even for someone who has never practiced martial arts.The on-screen chemistry of the actors does not work although Jackie Chan pulls off his role as mentor - because he is a martial artist and very skilled.What a shame karate professional were not used for the filming and making of this high budget movie which fails to hit the mark on and off the mats!I switched the film off half way through it which by the way is over 2 hours long! So not sure what the objective of the movie was other than give your son as much airtime as possible!Awefully disappointing I hope a second remake stays true to the original but it will be hard to follow since that has set a Kung Fu scene. So remakes now will all be on a similar downward slope.,The Karate Kid
326,weirdstrike,Well...it has it's merits...,5,23 June 2010,"If you're looking to see something like the 80's version, you'd be mistaken. While the concept is the same, it's all different. Starting with Jaden being about 8 years younger than Ralph when they took the roles.Unlike the original, I think, this lacks...that umph. I'm not sure what it is, but the original definitely had more character, it felt more raw and more believable than this one. The new one just felt more commercialized, like there was less interest in making the characters or the plot unique. Dre's the typical American kid sticking like a sore thumb in a foreign country. Meets girl. Culture keeps them apart. Bullies. Blah, blah, blah. Though the original was still a clichéd plot, there was just that thing, that umph, that the new one didn't.I guess because it's a remake of something that's a pop icon, and when the first one came out, it was just an idea.But this does have it's merits. It has funny moments, intentional or not. It's a feel good movie, and fun for the family.My advice: Looking to see a reincarnation or anything close to the 80's version - Don't go. Looking for some light, family fun, or you're just bored - Do go.",The Karate Kid

328,pete-742-519660,As a movie in its own right...,8,26 July 2010,"Looking at the reviews posted so far on IMDb, it seems that great scathing criticism is being imparted from those who feel a loyal affinity to the 80s original, and considerably better feedback comes from those who either don't know the original or don't feel the need to make comparisons.Let me begin by explaining my standpoint on the whole remake thing: Nobody has ruined the original Karate Kid.It's still there. You can still rent it, buy it and see it on the telly.It's the same with book adaptations. If you prefer the original source material, stick with that.If the adaptation or remake were identical to the original, there'd be no point in making it.There. I said it.So what's different about this movie? The kid is younger. In my book that's a plus point, as bullying affects all ages, but it's the younger victims that often feel most helpless. That, and it's easier to evoke sympathy for a younger victim of bullying than an older teen, who the audience might expect to be better able to stand up for himself. The Karate Kid isn't be a wimp - but he is out of his depth. That's a point well played in my opinion.The movie has been set in China. Brilliant! The original had the boy and his mom move to another American city. Again, Dre's out of his element completely. Good for the narrative. That, and I like movies to take me where I've seldom or never been before. Movies have taken me to suburban middle-class America way too often. This was refreshing.The martial art being taught is Kung Fu. Big deal. The movie is still a remake of the Karate Kid. The title's a familiar one. Dre's initial interest in martial arts comes from Karate tuition videos. And his mother is shown not to know the difference between one and t'other. It makes absolutely no difference to the story at all. It could have been Judo, fencing or the Noble Welsh Art of Unarmed Hitting for all the difference it makes.Besides that, the structure and storyline are very close to the original. All the key events are there - although wax on, wax off and paint the fence have been replaced with something else equally abstract. It still works.Jayden Smith does a good job (but is frighteningly similar to his dad).Jackie Chan proves himself to be a very decent dramatic actor. He's great in the role of Mr Han.The structure and pacing of the remake is relaxed, and very un-Hollywood. And the cinematography is understated and gorgeous - possibly due to the fact that it's a US/Chinese co-production.I thoroughly enjoyed it.And, as a litmus test, I tool my six-year-old son. He sat riveted through the 140-minute character-driven drama, and came out at the end saying 'That was so brilliant!' In all, a job well done, methinks!",The Karate Kid
329,cindyrogers,A decent remake of the story,6,26 June 2010,"I was a huge fan of the original Karate Kid and with the magic surrounding it as the first I had seen such a story, I knew it would be difficult to top.I was not disappointed. I think Jadan is very talented and super cute. The setting made it interesting and was symbolic since China is going to be our biggest competitor. My favorite line was 'There is a big difference between being still, and doing nothing'Did anyone else think it was odd that the repairman (Chan) made the environmental reference with the shower and hot water? As if China is big on conservation as a country? It is going to be the worlds biggest polluter by far!!",The Karate Kid
330,sammykiy2004,Wimp to Champion?,8,20 March 2011,"This remake was a lot better than the ridiculous comments. The jacket on and off was obvious because it's a change up from the original wax on wax off. This movie is a remake, not an original film. Don't be so stupid and say it's an obvious recreation when it's supposed to be. Also, being a wimp doesn't mean you can't fight or can;t learn to fight, a wimp is too scared too fight is too scared to do either. Dre never was scared in the beginning, and who wouldn't run from 7 dudes trying to kill you. Besides he showed no fear with the water attack. You people who are so judgmental need to wake up and stop trying to relive your pasts when you first saw the original Karate kid. This movie was just as good as the the Original when I first saw it, but i think Jaden and the rest of the cast did an exceptional job fighting and acting.

Sure there was a lot of things that annoyed me, the unnecessary love story, the predictable story, Jaden Smith in general. Nonetheless, i still had factors i enjoyed.For example, the Karate scenes (Oh sorry, Kung Fu) were pretty good, and Jackie Chan was a good character to play ""Mr.Han"", but i expected these things already, i mean, it's supposed to be a martial arts movie? It's a pretty good film, even though Jaden can't act which kind of ruined it, but definitely worth watching, especially from a family perspective.",The Karate Kid

A child in a far off land, meets a girl, gets bullied, learns kung fu, kicks some butt, justice served and in between these moments there are some great scenes and even some tear jerking moments.The original Karate Kid is not in the same league as this flick, but there are some nods to the old film.If you want to be entertained watch this movie.Wax on Wax off!....",The Karate Kid
333,mlaschwanden,Cute Movie,9,5 November 2010,"I loved this movie. The scenery and looking in on Chinese culture was my favorite part of the movie!! Especially the calisthenics, architecture, the play with the puppets, and the lady moving with the cobra on the cliff. Jaden Smith and Mei are absolutely charming and adorable. I personally thought the hip hop and the dancing scenes were fun and made an interesting contrast with the Chinese culture. This was a great roll for Jackie Chan. His fight scenes are always so well choreographed-too bad we didn't see more of him. Overall, I liked the movie as much as Karate Kid one and much more than Karate Kid two, which was beyond silly at times. I personally would have appreciated more originality in the movie regarding fighting. Too many fight scenes were reminiscent of the original.",The Karate Kid
334,annoyingthing321,Live's up to it's reputation,8,3 January 2011,"The Karate Kid is a charmer, one of those films that leaves you with a happy feeling after seeing it. It is quite different to the original, the main point being that Dre Parker actually learns KUNG FU instead of karate, which, let's be honest, is a little misleading. I think most of the differences work well, so the film doesn't kill off the original like so many other remakes have. In fact, there are some bits I prefer, especially the smashed up car scene. Jackie Chan conveys so much emotion and atmosphere that you find yourself choking back tears every time you see it. There are also some pretty funny bits when Dre attempts Chinese. The acting is great to watch. Jaden Smith is like a mini replica of his father. It seems Jaden has picked up many of Will's mannerisms, and it's kind of cute. Jackie Chan surprised me. I'm used to seeing him in films like Rush Hour and Tuxedo where his character is comical and silly, so I was skeptical that he would be able to pull off a very serious performance that is Mr Miyagi (or in this case, Mr Han). Yet, as usual, I was proved wrong, and I think he has proved himself to be a great actor as well as a great stuntman. My complaints are pretty small. Some moments concerning Dre's relationship with Meiying are quite cringe-worthy, and possibly unnecessary, but you expect these things in a film. I also think that the bullies could've been better and more threatening.So Karate Kid has definitely lived up to it's predecessor's reputation. A very enjoyable family film.",The Karate Kid
335,dancecorp,Pleasant to watch but poorly named and acted in,3,16 March 2011,"I was very hopeful of this movie, having grown up in the 80's seeing all of the original Karate Kid movies I though cool a sweet up to date remake of a 80's hit. While the storyline was pleasant and easy for even my four year old to follow... I found the overall acting poor. Jaden Smith had the best performance and even his performance was barely direct to video quality. Jackie Chan, is boring to watch and his acting makes me wish for the days of cheap Bruce Lee Kung Fu movies that are poorly dubbed. The title overseas is correct, because they titled the movie correctly. It is THE KUNG FU KID, not the KARATE KID... KARATE & KUNG FU are as different as Christians and Muslims. Obviously Hollywood producers have no clue, and neither do the studios. To the Average person, Kung Fu, Karate, Tae Kwon Do, Jujitsu... they are all the same... THEY ARE NOT... Heck even the movie itself is smart enough to make this point. Yet Kung Fu is the ""IT"" Marshal Art right now... SO I figure my kids will see this remade in about 15 years as the Karate Kid, again... but the Kid will be taught Tae Kwon Do or maybe they will go way off base and Have the movie based in Isreal and have the kid learn Krav Maga... yet call it the KARATE KID... The movie would have gotten by being called the Kung Fu Kid, or anything else... but they played on a name to try to get you to see it... and well it fooled a lot of us.",The Karate Kid

337,Mike4785,Excellent!!!,9,20 June 2010,"I have recently been reading about Bruce Lee and martial arts philosophy, and thus decided to see this film when I heard that it was set in China and has Jackie Chan as the kung fu teacher. I had seen the original Karate Kid, which was decent enough in 1984, but was hoping that a new version set in China would be more fresh and sophisticated. I was not disappointed. In fact, the film really exceeded all my expectations.First, the film is informed by Eastern philosophy. Not all of these philosophic aspects are explicitly explained in the film, so I'm not sure how well they will resonate with viewers who are not familiar with Eastern culture and philosophy, but this is an outstanding treatment of key aspects of the martial arts: a. It conveys the idea that physical and mental/emotional disciplines are linked. One benefits mentally and emotionally from physical disciplines, but at the same time, one's mental discipline is also a source of physical health and well-being. The two are inter-linked.b. The benefits of a discipline are not limited only to martial arts. As Jackie Chan clearly states at one point in the film, everything is kung fu. The film draws a parallel between the boy's learning of martial arts and the challenge that another character wrestles with in learning to excel at music.c. The purpose of martial arts is not for purely external functions (such as beating people up). Rather, a much greater cultural and psychological value stems from the personal insights and growth that the practice of a complex discipline encourages. We see this occur throughout the film, thanks to the film's heavily character-oriented approach to its subject. Also, while the film sets up a self-defense motivation at the beginning, it thankfully doesn't remain fixated on its ""villain"" character (who seems to actually not be seen for about 45 minutes in the middle of the film) but rather shifts expertly to the deeper character-oriented changes and effects.Secondly, various elements that paralleled the 1984 film were strengthened by a treatment that was more deeply metaphorical and philosophical (although I was also deeply impressed that many of these philosophical elements were expressed non-verbally, purely through the outstanding talents of the casts, filmmakers, and writers/advisers involved). Thus: a. those who are already familiar with the 1984 film will still enjoy a fresh treatment of these elements, in the midst of a much stronger relationship between student and teacher and friends (which is another aspect of the more Eastern tone of this film). Rather than a purely self-serving type of training that is ""revealed"" to be useful for self-defense, this film employs exercises for the ""Kung Fu Kid"" that are personally relevant to established personality traits.b. Extra depth is found beneath the surface appearances, as the boy adapts ideas not only from his teacher but also from others, such as a woman with a cobra, and creatively adds those ideas to his style. (Bruce Lee would certainly approve of the films' treatment of the creative and expressive aspects of the martial arts.) c. The boy learns to convey things non-verbally, and thus sometimes more powerfully. This doesn't refer to applications of brute force (although the honorable uses he makes of combat techniques in the final fights are their own form of expression about restraint and honor, which the antagonist recognizes and respects) but rather to a range of ordinary, peaceful, character interactions, both comical (as with his sudden silence when listening *too intently* to his mother, which unsettles her) and poignant (when the boy is moved by learning about his teacher's past tragedy (which also reveals what both are teaching/gaining from each other), the boy silently goes aside and then offers the handle of training staffs that had previously bound them during a martial sequence - a brilliant metaphor that not only tells of the new purpose the teacher has found *as a teacher* but also of the support provided by the boy in helping the teacher overcome the crippling pain of his tragic human loss from a car accident he had caused.Third: As required for a character-oriented drama that uses sometimes non-verbal poignant scenes to convey things about the characters' emotions and motivations, the performances were really strong, showing very few weaknesses, and the film was thus emotionally involving and powerful for those willing and able to empathize (and who don't need clichéd macho posturing in the characters).As for drawbacks and flaws in the film, I can think of very few. I found a scene in which the boy was implied to throw dirty water over the villain to be quite out of place in the emotional and character-based context in which it occurred. And there were some moves in the final tournament scenes that were really too elaborate to be realistic - especially given that the boy only had formal training for perhaps a few months. Also, many tournament sequences were filmed with a shaky camera - perhaps to lessen the forcefulness of some of the combat blows by making them less clearly seen and harder to follow. For these faults, I have rated the film as a ""9"" rather than a ""10."" They are pretty minor flaws that I am happy to overlook. I am also happy that the ""villain"" was not so one-note as the 1984 character - since he feels some justification for his (admittedly excessive) use of force to encourage the musical success of the girl and discourage the protagonist from distracting and possibly dishonoring her. The fact that the film didn't fixate on the use of a villain is a sign of just how superior it is to so many other ""martial arts films."" This film is primarily about characters and growth, and martial arts are merely an established means used to promote that growth.",The Karate Kid
338,Proctorism,An unbiased and honest review,4,21 June 2010,"I will be the first to admit that I am a major fan of the the first Karate Kid and not a fan of Jaden Smith. However, I went into this movie expecting to be disappointed in Jaden and walked away disappointed in 3 totally different things. After watching this film, I am convinced that Will Smith bought off the critics and those that voted this highly or said this was better than the original were 1 of 3 things 1) A plant of the studio or close friends. 2) under the influence, or 3) too busy getting physically pleasured to really focus. This film had 3 major flaws and Jadens acting ability or lack thereof was the least of this films worries and truthfully, though I don't think Jaden can act his way out of a paper bag, his performance didn't help or hurt the film, I think he was the same as he was in the others. with that said, I will say that his martial arts skills were good and it's obvious that he put in a lot of work and effort into learning the form. I'll give credit where credit is due and for that reason I give this a 4. However, this film lacks the 3 C's. Cohesion, Chemistry and Character development. Lets start with Cohesion.Cohesion: For those that don't know what cohesion means, its the glue that holds and strings things together, makes it flow seamlessly. If you have A-C cohesion would be ""B"". There were a lot of A's and C's no B's.This film left you wondering many times ""how did we get here?"" Lets put aside the fact that Jaden is in a new country and doesn't know the language. I found it very interesting how he and his mother got around so well with just having got there. There was no explanation for much of anything at all and at times it appeared that things were thrown in just to have an excuse to have a love interest, or for Jaden to be bullied or for his mom to have some dialogue. Like the original Karate Kid or not, did you at any point feel ""this movie is dragging along?"" Which brings me to...Chemistry: There was none AT ALL, it felt like a 1 night stand. No ones performance made me give a damn about their cause. Some say well Ralph Macchio didn't give an Oscar worthy performance. Well he didn't have to be Daniel Day Lewis in the film because he and Pat Morita had chemistry. Ralph was raw and natural and Pat's comedic timing and seriousness was on point every time. You cared about them. Billy Zabka and his croonies had personality you hated them and even cheered for Johnny at times, Daniels mom, Lucille had ridiculous personality, even sensei was personable. I felt too much was rushed and an attempt to include nostalgia. Chan was decent in here, but he and Jaden did not bond well at all, nor did Jaden and his mother. This was not a role for Taraji, Elise Neal would have been better. The girl was just thrown in for the sake of a cute girl and introduction to the bully, which takes me to my final point..Character development: It is hard to have cohesiveness and chemistry if your characters are poorly developed. Yes this is a Karate Kid remake and don't lie and say its not, some of the exact same dialogue, exact same scenarios, changing the country and training/learning tools does not make it a re-imagining, a re imagined film doesn't use anything pre existing. But how you can not build the characters is beyond me. Again, Dre's mom was just in their for the sake of Dre having a mother. She did a lot of non sensible things. I mean where did she work for heavens sakes? We knew Lucille was working at the computer place and then the orient restaurant. She let him just do kung fu with Mr. Han without any knowledge of him. Han didn't fix a bike or anything. Lucille knew Miyagi he did a few things before befriending Daniel. Johnny the spoiled brat had great development, Ali from the hills, Sensei the Vietnam vet who was militant. Can you honestly tell me why the bully in this remake was the way he was and who in the hell was sensei, what is his background? The story telling was simply awful, everything was just plain rushed. So I am not going to bash this movie because of Jadens braids or his skin color or because of his rich daddy. I am recommending not to see this because its flat out boring. My 10 year old daughter finds joy in almost any film, she fell asleep on this one, we were at the drive in, people where driving away. Oh and Jadens dialogue near the end before his absurd comeback, sounded like he was tired of filming and just wanted to get the lines over with. Ralph may not be stellar, but at least you cared about his character and the supporting cast. Remove the characters from this film and see what difference it makes. Meaning, if you take out Ali from KK1, you will feel something is missing. Remove the chick from this one and any cause could replace her, not saying she wasn't good at her role, it just wasn't memorable or necessary.I'll put it like this, when you walked away from the original KK and even to this day, you don't call Pat Morita, Pat Morita, you see his photo and you say ""that's Mr. Miyagi"" you see Ralph, you don't call him Ralph, you call him Daniel -san"" Their characters were believable. you walk from this and its Jaden and Jackie Chan. I hope JW (Jerry Weintraub) got paid good for this, because this is beneath him. Poor character development, poor story. The end",The Karate Kid

I didn't have high expectations for it and just thought my little brother would enjoy it because it's got martial arts in it. What I got was a fantastic surprise! This film is funny, heart warming, full of action and suspense, and all around entertaining! The acting was good, and more subtle than usual films targeted at a younger audience. Both Smith and Chan were wonderful, and the scenes between them were some of the most enjoyable that I've watched in a while. The pacing was great, and there were so many moments were I was on the edge of my seat completely engrossed in the story.Take a chance, and grab some friends and go to see this film.

This is really a great movie.,10,6 January 2016,"Jackie Chan is won of the most talented film makers (also actor, writer, producer, stunt man, director, etc) in the world! I have seen many of his films, including some great Chinese films with sub titles that he has made. Mr. Chan has produced, acted in and directed many popular movies that have not been seen by audiences around the world because you have to find a copy with subtitles. The Karate Kid is a good example of some of his American work.Ignore the low review by the viewer who was disappointed because it did not include enough karate and fighting. This movie is a story about a boy who competes in karate competition.",The Karate Kid
341,davidcharleslemon,A Great Film,8,25 February 2017,"I went and saw The Karate Kid in theaters back when it came out, and I highly enjoyed it. To this day I have seen it multiple times, and I grow to love it more each viewing. This film is one of the finest remakes I have seen in my life, and it shows. In the 2 1/2 hour run time, this movie fit a lot in it's span. We get so much character development, that it takes nearly an hour to get into the story, but I enjoy it. This movie is not fully about the karate, as it includes a teen romance, but that is not the best, -1 star. And, yes, the acting can be thin at times, but you have to remember that these kids are just 10-12 years old. This is probably Jaden Smith's best performance. Another dislike i have about this film, is the fast pacing in the beginning, and the slower pacing near the end, -1 star. If it was consistent, The final rating would be 9/10. This film is great for young kids, and adults too. I really love this movie, and I don't see how anyone can't enjoy The Karate Kid.",The Karate Kid

I was expecting a comical family movie, but I was wrong. Instead I got an action filled drama! I was indeed surprised and happy. It was the first time that I saw Jackie Chan in a real dramatic role. He gave an award-winning performance as well. I thoroughly enjoyed watching both of them work together as student and teacher. The stunts were well carried out, one thing I admired is that they didn't look choreographed, they looked real. The so called child 'villain' did a brilliant job portraying his character. In a serious and comical way, I think that Jaden Smith will become a better Actor than his father Will! It was a well-done movie, and Jaden Smith is to be commended for his work.",The Karate Kid
344,millennium_critic,The Karate Kid (2010) is a great movie. Surpasses original.,10,12 June 2010,"So, I just got back from seeing Jaden Smith's first star vehicle The Karate Kid (the movie had been sold out since the 11:15am show) and....wow. I was truly impressed as I only went in with modest expectations. Not only was it a very good remake, it's the best movie so far this summer, and it stands on it's own two feet and surpasses the original in a lot of ways (which one is better will probably be generational. From the standing ovation these kids at the theater I attended gave this film I'm pretty sure from 15 or so on down, it will be this one.) But first off, let me start by saying this: To anyone who doubts that Jaden Smith can act (which he ironically already proved in The Pursuit of Happiness), is a star, or deserved this movie: See The Karate Kid. I don't care how you see it. Pirated. Bootleg. Or the old fashion way (like I saw it cause I'm cool like that) by buying a frickin' ticket and sitting in an auditorium with a bunch of cheering 10 year olds (I swear I've never seen kids give a movie a damn near standing ovation like they did during this film's finale).Jaden Smith has just silenced his haters. From here on out, if you don't like Jaden Smith: fine. Whatever petty reason you've given yourself to make you not like an innocent 10 year old. Fine. But you can't say he's not talented. Cause he is. If nothing has proved it to you before, THIS will. He carries the film on his little shoulders, shows leading man qualities (has a 10 year old ever done that?!?!? And Im being serious here). Has a ten year old ever acted in a film and not only carried it but possessed the charm, charisma, quick wit, comedic timing, dramatic presence and physicality of a hero all in the same movie?!?!? I shutter to think, I couldn't think of any leaving the theater. If they have, please point them out to me so I can say bravo to them to. His performance was truly great and the fact that he did all of his own stunts and clearly learned kung fu and looks not only believable but in command of the craft is some sort of a mini-miracle. This little dude is miniature Will Smith of the highest caliber. He WILL be a star (pun, intended). Only thing can stop that is, well, him. Barring any personal issues, the kid will go far. Very far. He has it all. And as cliché as it may sound the biggest development to come out of the Karate Kid is that ""A Star is Born"". Don't believe me: watch it for yourself.But I digress, I only spent so much time on the Jaden issue because all the unwarranted hatred thrown his way is beyond disturbing. I have never seen such vitriolic speech directed towards a kid in my life. Not even the kid from Problem Child and he was a certified a-hole! But anyway, the movie is good. Jackie Chan was surprisingly really good (and I mean really really good like Oscar-nominee good) in a dramatic turn as Dre Parker's mentor. The action was better than the original's and the heart and soul was just as engaging and entertaining. Though lacking the iconic ""wax on, wax off""-moment what they do with ""jacket on, jacket off"" was truly surprising and pretty good stuff when you realize what Mr. Han was really teaching him. Instead of the ""Crane Kick"" we do have another pose and it's pretty damn good too. To me, the original will always be special. I remember Daniel-son, and Mr. Miyagi is a fuggin' legend in every sense of the word. I'm actually utterly surprised this remake was so well made and engaging. Even though every one in the theater knew the outcome, everyone was still cheering and/or elated and moved by the movies ""big moments"". That in itself is pretty impressive. It's like if people were still surprised even though they knew who the killer(s) were in Scream 4 before seeing it. Could you imagine that? Yea, I couldn't either. Which is why I'm surprised at how good this remake was.Go see it.",The Karate Kid

349,t-burke5,"See it, or Flee it?",6,13 June 2010,"Currently, with a 5.1/10 rating, this is a very underrated film. I don't understand why Jaden Smith is getting so much hate, whether it is because he was ""pushed in"" to the movie business or if it's because he's playing a black person who moves to China, where in the original, the main character is white. I can tell that a large amount of people that voted haven't even seen this before. This film contains beautiful cinematography, great fighting scenes, and fun music for the audience to listen to.Let's forget that the main character is black, and is moving to China, for a second. Do you think this movie would still have gotten 5.1/10? I truly recommend this film to everyone. Children and even adults will like this movie. Before you go to the movie, don't base it on the IMDb rating, because most likely, you'll go into the film thinking it's bad, then going with the crowd. First, check the IMDb message boards, or check a website with real critics like Rotten Tomatoes, or AOL movies.This is one of the my favourite films (though not the best) of 2010, and should not be missed by anybody. So should you ask the question ""See it, or flee it?"" I will, and as will many others respond with a ""see it"". 7/10.",The Karate Kid
350,andybobbins14,Very average in most ways but an over confident lead is the problem.,6,15 September 2010,"This film although meets the criteria for at least an enjoyable movie; if not a little long has one big flaw, which in my opinion ruins the film, and that is how Jaden plays the character with too much confidence.The basis of this film should be about a personal journey, a child who's lack of confidence allows him to be pushed around and left unnoticed to most others. Learning Karate should be a means to building the characters confidence and be seen as an equal with the others. However what we have is your stereotypical black kid who is over confident and has too many social skills. Jadens character has no problems standing up for himself, or getting the girl its these skills that actually get him in trouble. The problem I have is that a main character like this has no room for development. I believe its harder to identify with a person who has no real issues bar being cocky and annoying others, which therefore makes him less likable. This is not necessarily a critique of Jadens acting, but maybe the directors inability to not stereotype a black person.I will still give this film a 6 because although I dislike the main character, I believe the supporting cast is still pretty good and very interesting to see Jackie Chan in a non comedy role. As for the fighting over the top but I think most will appreciate its style it's not going to win any awards, but it will still keep people entertained. To push it to a higher rating would mean having some originality or an all-round solid cast which it doesn't.So to summarise a solid 6/10 There's enough to stop you from nodding off and feel relatively entertained, however I think most people will find Dre (Jaden Smith) very annoying.",The Karate Kid

352,mjfwritesu,"Starting a tradition like ""Bambi""...",9,15 June 2010,"When I was very young, my mother took me to see Walt Disney's original ""Bambi"". It was one of my early memorable experiences. I loved that movie and it not only stayed with me, but it impacted my love for movies to this day.I am a youthful grandma (""mee-maw"") and decided to take my first grandson (only 8 months old) to see this as his first movie experience. My youngest son, his uncle, also accompanied us.The movie was so beautiful, exciting and dynamic to watch, that not only did we two adults enjoy it, but the baby intently watched about 75% -- when he wasn't sleeping.Jaden was so magnetic and adorable to watch (you could easily see personality traits of Will), Taraji was ""real"" - which was refreshing, Jackie was powerful in his intensity - great to see him in a dramatic light, and the story (although re-told) was both relate-able as a single-parent story and delightful!!

353,Nocturnous,If Disney made Karate Kid.,1,16 June 2010,"Clumsy exposition that is trying to be subtle, but ends up being super direct, in that intellectually insulting way. From the beginning to the end, this movie really talks down to its audience, even if the demographic aimed at is children. I found myself laughing at serious scenes which were not only bizarre but ridiculously overreaching. I really hate it when stories explain directly what is painfully obvious, or try to insert it, in unrealistic and absurd ways.Jacket on and Jacket off is no wax on wax off. At least in the original film, Daniel thought he was being put to work, here it's just outright bizarre. Jaden's character seems to be oblivious of the obvious, and unquestioning of the ridiculous.Ralph Macchio's performance was far more believable. Jaden Smith goes way to far way too quick, from wimp to kung fu champion. The exaggeration and elaborate fight scenes really removed me from a sense of realism, that its predecessor had.I found the mother character to be at odds with this move. I would have preferred if her role was downplayed. She was ultimately lacking chemistry with Jaden and not an interesting character, mostly annoying.Just a quick comparison with Pat Morita and Jacky Chan. Chan is flash with Chinese superstition. Pat was subtle with universal wisdom and was far more endearing.There is just far too much mundane filler, it really slows the movie down and in conclusion when this movie wasn't extremely bizarre, I found it to be more flash than substance.",The Karate Kid
354,brinleyang,Bad bad bad,2,1 July 2010,"I'm a fan of the original Karate Kid, this remake is just disappointing. Firstly, there isn't any karate in this movie which makes the title look silly. Secondly, while I'm also a big fan of Jackie Chan, he only had 1 fight scene with a bunch of kids and that lacked his usual comedic and well choreographed fight sequences. Its either his age has finally caught up with him or the kids just didn't have enough training.The next problem with the movie is Jaden Smith was just not suitable for this role. Although he showed promise as an actor with a bright future, He lacked the strength and the skills to be the Karate Kid. I know Ralph Macchio wasn't exactly muscular either, but at least he was not as tiny and fragile looking as Jaden.Lastly, I could not quite see the chemistry between Jackie and Jaden that everyone was raving about, throughout the first half of the film it just looked like a dirty old man plotting something sinister on that innocent little new kid in a foreign country.",The Karate Kid
355,Proboarder2712,In defence of this movie.,7,24 January 2021,"Not sure what happened to my previous review but here we go again.I get a ton of people were very upset about this movie. Did you even watch The Karate kid part 2 3 and the Next Karate kid? The first movie has many flaws as well with poor choreography. Mr Morita was very slow with his moves. I get that he was old but it kind of throws off some of the realism. Part 2 was nice because we got to see some new locations and the stakes were heightened as instead of fighting against bullies, the two have to fight for their lives. It wasn't as good but is still a very watchable movie. Because we get to see the characters further developed.The third movie is where this series falls apart. Mr. Miyagi and Daniels past relationships were thrown away again. This time Daniel finds a new love interest but she has a boyfriend so that will be over at the end of this movie too. And now people are out to seek revenge against Daniel by.. Making him lose in a tournament again?
Finally we get to The Next Karate Kid. This movie was horrible all around. Mr Miyagi is a bumbling idiot who knows Karate. Hilary Swank was completely unrelatable. I didn't find her even attractive. She learned how to do a mantis kick and hit some bags and she turned into the same type of fighter Daniel was. We are never lead to believe she is in horrible danger because we are never shown her in any actual danger. She is annoying the whole film while learning nothing by the end of the movie.Those three paragraphs feel like I am reviewing a series but it raises a point. Was the 2010 Karate Kid as bad as films 3 and 4? Not even close. Those of you who rated this movie less than a 4. Did you even watch these other movies?
Let's get the easy things out of the way. Sherry (Dre's mom) is nearly pointless in this movie. She helps drive the plot by taking him to China for a... transfer after the original company shut down? She speaks no Chinese but we don't know why she is so important they sent her or someone who actually understands the language.
Jaden's acting is pretty rough but I'll get to that later as to why I think it actually works in this film. There is no karate in the Karate Kid. Instead it is Kung Fu. They even make the name kind of a joke when Sherry asks Dre if he doesn't like that Karate class. The whole movie feels awkward.Now the controversy. This movie for me is kind of a guilty pleasure. We have a black kid in a mostly Chinese neighborhood. He doesn't know the language, culture or anything non-American. He is a stubborn boy who doesn't want to know anything. That turns him into a whiny little Sh##. But remember. He is 10. I think this was one of Jaden's first movies so I kind of give him a pass. He behaves exactly like a 10 year old would. I'm taking my ball and going home!
These are the same types of fights a typical child might get into if he has a hot head and doesn't fit in. He is not Mr. Suave who can talk his way out of any situation.
I don't want to pull the ""because he is black..."" card but if you've never been stereotyped before because of your race/nationality, then you don't really know what its like being seen as a foreigner in another country. I've seen arguments that this would never happen because Honor is so well taught. Except IRL, we saw famous K-pop artists getting caught committing voyeur cam crimes. While I personally feel very safe Asian big cities, petty crime and gangs still exist. Honor is important but it is not like it is as strong as the force. Saving face is far more important in Chinese culture.
Jackie was great in this film. He mimicked a lot of Morita's magic while creating some of his own (flyswatter). We saw some comedy from Jackie's facial expressions and I felt some real pain with the car scene. As for the Jacket scene. If you don't like that.. you can blame Jackie. The directors said in a BTS scene they wanted a unique wax on, wax off moment and this is what Jackie came up with. It works as children leave their toys everywhere and don't want to pick up after themselves. This scene made me wow because how intense Jackie was while Jaden was looking star struck.
I enjoyed the locations we got to visit, I enjoyed the fresh take. I enjoyed most of our main characters and I think this film has a lot going for it. If you're watching Cobra Kai, you don't need to watch this movie but it is still a fun time. I give it a 6.5 rating rounded up for IMDB. I feel like it is on par with the original film perhaps a small step down. But this is Far greater than film 3 and 4.",The Karate Kid

In fact, if it had been called anything other than ""Karate Kid"", I would have liked it better. It could have stood on its own as a karate flick and the cast was right. But as reboots go, this was a mistake. If you liked the original, this isn't close enough to it to do the nostalgia factor.Its done well and is, in and of itself, a decent film.There are certainly enough other films out there that are worse than this, but in the world of remakes...this is closer to the Dukes of Hazzard rather than Charlies angels. This is the diet-coke of reboots...the quasi-reboot (thanks Doc)...lol. Jackie Chan is at his best in this, although, as someone well known for his own stunts, a lot of this looked fake. And somehow, the fresh prince of china comes to mind. If you can get past a lot of the obvious ""screw-ups""...its OK However, it tries so hard to emulate the original that it winds up not emulating it at all.

To be fair, I was expecting a lot from this movie. But it disappointed me from the beginning with its poor acting. We've gotten used to Jackie Chan's acting but Jaden and Taraji (as well as the little white kid) should have done better. Only the thrill of watching the action (as displayed in the trailers) kept me awake and I quite enjoyed the 15 minutes at the end. Why not? It had Jackie Chan. However, the jokes were old, the story was too obvious, the dialogues were all Clichés. Maybe it deserves 5/10 because of the action but the bad acting was overwhelming for me.

Jaden Smith is starting to grow into a good actor. He played his role well for the most part throughout the movie. There were some parts where he may have over acted, but that did not overshadow the rest of the movie. The action scenes were very good!! I enjoy the fact that they didn't hold back or make it into the same cheesy action as the original Karate Kid. Jackie Chan played his role well in the movie and he was a great mentor. It is quite crazy to me how everyone seems to focus on the name being wrong for this movie...SERIOUSLY!!! What is in a name? That most certainly did not make the movie. The storyline is what made the movie and it was a very good one. Way to go Will and Jada on creating a film that I can definitely see being a classic!!

361,snowbrdr88,A beautiful film that captures your heart!,9,20 June 2010,"Personally, I don't understand why so many people dislike this movie so much. First, the acting is definitely great, and nothing short of that. Jaden has so many of his fathers mannerisms and his attitude is a major reflection of Wills great success. Chan brings to much passion and emotion to the screen, it's as if he was born to perform this way! The cinematography is like eye candy, and enhances the experience in every way. Not being a big fan of the original, I thought this remake did a fantastic job captivating me and drawing me in to the characters and the story. Obviously it's your ordinary story-line, but in todays industry where just about everything has been done, the necessary flare was brought about that made it very original. The fight scenes definitely had me going ""holy ***"" inside, and had my heart pounding! With all this, the script itself was also very strong, and was complimented very well by those playing the roles.

362,scady-780-886548,Loved it!,9,10 November 2010,"First things first, you CAN NOT compare this version of the Karate Kid to the original, because when you do, it makes you judge it much easier. It's one of those kinds of movies that you need to push the original out of your mind for a while. I admit I am a huge fan of the original Karate Kid, but I still liked this version a lot despite its differences. I'm actually a little happy that they didn't try to copy every little thing from the original into this one. Otherwise it'd be like seeing the original all over again, only with different actors and actresses and there would be nothing new about it and perhaps not even as exciting and making you want to sit at the edge of your seat.But this movie certainly had me at the edge of my seat. I laughed, I cried, I smiled... I had a great time. It was wonderful and epic. Jaden Smith is a great actor with a lot of potential in his future with his acting career. He's great. :) What I also really enjoyed about this movie were the other things like the sets, the acting, and most of all the research that was done on ancient Kung Fu/Qi Gong that they incorporated. It was refreshing to see something so beautiful and graceful, and something I didn't actually see in the original that I wish they had done then. But this movie has it all. I loved it from beginning to end and highly recommend it. :)",The Karate Kid

He is whiney and cruel to his mom the entire movie, and this movie wants you to feel bad for him. It isn't easy making a movie without the kid being annoying, but it can be done (e.g. Role Models).The next section is the emotions the movie brings out of us. It didn't. I had a blank face the entire movie. SPOILER: Even when Jackie Chan tells Jaden that his family died because of him, I had a blank face. It didn't make me sad, happy, angry, or anything. A good movie is supposed to bring emotions out of you, and it didn't. But then again, I am a male and the two girls I went with loved it, but they also liked The Last Airbender and the Twilight series.The soundtrack was awful. The soundtrack of a movie is a MAJOR part of it, since music can bring out emotions in you, but it didn't.The relationship between Jaden Smith and Wenwen Han was completely unrealistic. For example, do any of you remember Padme and Anakin's relationship in Episode II? It was worse than that. I made me LAUGH how pathetic it was. Jaden: My mom says that if you stand while eating, it gives you gas! Wenwen: HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA! Pathetic, right?This is what made me laugh, though. Jackie Chan made Jaden take his jacket on, off, and hang it up, take it off, drop it, and repeat. In my mind, I was thinking ""You've got to be kidding me."" Those scenes were sad and pathetic attempts at making Karate/Kung Fu mysterious.Lets end this review on a somewhat positive note. The fight scenes were pretty cool, even if they were between two undeveloped children. 2/10",The Karate Kid
364,badger-of-doom,A Brilliant remake,9,5 August 2010,"How to remake a film that worked, it is a difficult thing and one where many will be disappointed whatever you do, some will hate it because it is not the original some because it is.That said I really enjoyed this, many nods to the original (although with slight twists), plus terrific interactions between the actors. You had a sense of a period of time being spent training rather than heres two moves and now you can fight.....I felt Chan was great and it felt like he had a relationship with Smith, the mother was more than a 2D add on (something that can not be said for the original) and the motivation for them all was clear.I enjoy Chan in films like this rather than the slapstick he seems to usually performs, I will also be looking out for Smith in future films.Karate kid is not and will never be more than a heart warming popcorn film, so I am not sure why others are judging it beyond that context.I am not claiming this is a film that will be remembered forever - nor will it change your life, but it is an enjoyable way to spend an evening.",The Karate Kid
365,andrerfcsantos,Good surprise,9,16 September 2010,"When i see the title of the movie ""karate kid"" and after watching the trailer, i wondered a film in which a men teaches a kid, then he goes to the tournament and wins. The story at the beginning seemed to be linear and some friends told me that was a lot of movies similar to that and so i should choose another movie to see.I haven't heard them at all, and i haven't also heard myself, so i decided to see the movie. What i saw it was a really good surprise. The story it was not linear as i thought. The love that Dre fell to the girl; the psicologic part of the training; the way Dre meets his trainer; Dre fighting not to win but only to not have scare are things that we don't found easily in this kind of movies! In this one that was all into it, and i can say that ""karate"" our Kong-Fu is only a part of the story, it is not all of it, what is a very good thing.This movie could be easily a fail, but it wouldn't, and it gave to me 140 pleasant minutes.",The Karate Kid
366,mbenweston,"Shameless ""Remake""",5,30 November 2010,"In itself it's not a bad film, entertaining to the end.However, as a fan of the original, why is this even called the Karate Kid? Couldn't they have at least had him learning Karate instead of Kung Fu? Worth a watch, but nothing to do with the original except the high level storyline is similar.Jaden Smith was a good little actor in it too, has the same expressions as his dad! Jackie Chan carries this film though. It would have been good to see some more Jackie Chan fighting with bad Dojo master. Maybe that will come with ""The Kung Fu Kid 2""?The film does also drag on far too long, it's far too long in the build up and then cuts short after the final kick. If you've not seen the original, then watch that first and put this one back on the shelf for a raining day!",The Karate Kid
367,Flashlight_Redlight,great movie,7,8 October 2010,this is a great movie. i like the original to. these are 2 different movies but both good. the only time i think this drags is when it tries to do what the first one did. but when its its own movie its pretty good. good performances by smith and chan. they have chemistry together. the fight scenes are done good. good music too.i look forward to the sequel. i hope it comes out soon. this could be a great franchise if they do it right. it could go either way. you never know.i look forward to smiths other stuff. hes come a long ways as an actor i think.,The Karate Kid
368,mygrls75,Why didn't alternate ending make it to the final cut???,10,9 October 2010,"I really enjoyed this movie. Of course, I also enjoyed all the original Karate Kids with Mr. Miyagi, but for some reason, this karate kid seemed just a little more real to life. Anyway, after watching this movie for about the 4th time, I discovered that there was actually an alternate ending between Mr. Hahn and Master Li, so being the curious person that I am, I looked up the alternate and watched it. I have one word to say...AWESOME! I don't just mean AWESOME but over the top, chills down your spine, high five AWESOME! Why wasn't this included in the final cut???? This epic battle is, in my opinion, the best final fight of ANY of the karate kid movies..better than the Miyagi vs Johnny and the gang, better than Miyagi vs Chozen and the gang...even better than what was up this point my favorite battle, the famous fight between Miyagi, Kreese, and Terry Silver,(if you haven't seen that one, you need too, it was Karate Kid III). What really leaves me frustrated, is that this alternate ending is only available on the Blu-Ray DVD combo pack....I have the DVD version. This is a five star movie, however, including that fight between Hahn and Master Li, would have given it the over the top flare that any good movie needs.",The Karate Kid
369,ela-marley,I did not rewind it...,1,13 October 2010,"I really watched this movie because I like Jackie Chan... He tried to do a good job, but he didn't achieve much. Now, even though he's the son of Will and Jada Smith, Jaden Smith is not talented when it comes to acting (although he was alright in The pursuit of happiness, maybe because he didn't really have to act). He would do a better job in another field for sure, maybe dancing or singing. The ""love"" interest of Jaden Smith, was twice his age, and the relationship was really awkward, just as the whole movie was. All in all, this attempt of a remake is (and probably will be forever) the worst Karate Kid ever made. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone. Waste of time.",The Karate Kid
370,jsteffey88,Very Good Remake,7,13 January 2011,"It's not often you see a remake that's actually as good as the original piece. First time I saw the trailer of the remake I nearly had severe doubts that this film would even coming close to reaching the original film. Boy, was I proved wrong! To start, I was very impressed with the director's modern aim in remaking the Kong-fu classic. There were only very few flaws in the film that I caught, such as the kid's mother's reason why they're moving to another country or the karate instructor's anger from a past he caused. Overall, the film was quite entertaining with the camera movements and James Horner's epic musical score. In addition, the training scenes throughout the film impressed me more with whole new combat styles and training equipment used to teach the new kid karate. As for the cast: Jaden Smith and Jackie Chan definitely surprised with me character chemistry and development. Though the re-done elements in the story seems very obvious to spot from the original film, it still brings a surprising outlook to the modern film. I hope this remake will be a sign(s) to director, Herald Zwart, that he should make more movies about kids growth and, perhaps, self-confident issues to people of all ages (suggestions, of course). Finally, my score to this movie. I almost want to give it an 8, but I fear that I would give way more appreciation than I already have, so I decided to give it a 7, due to the director's appreciated vision of the '84 classic with direct and entertaining story development about a kid and Kong-fu. This movie was fantastic and I can honestly say that this will be a part of my movie collection for years to come.",The Karate Kid
371,nsanefire,Bad scripts & Poor acting,2,12 February 2011,"After renting the movie, I was definitely not impressed with the script, nor with the acting. Being a fan of the original that came out when i was a kid, I'm a little biased but looking at it apart from the original series, it still REALLY SUCKED. Of course, one of the biggest fouls is they're labeling it the ""Karate"" Kid, the Japanese martial art, when in the movie Jaden Smith's character learns Kung Fu, the Chinese martial art. Even for franchising purposes, it's still pretty stupid. For me, the movie painted several very unrealistic scenarios. The biggest one was the casting of Taraji P. Henson to play the role of Sherry. The whole movie, she presents her character as a complete idiot who knows almost nothing about the world or her son and has somehow miraculously survived layoffs & firings to be transferred to the same job in Beijing. She portrays her character so poorly it makes the plot extremely unbelievable in that no one would ever move someone this dumb to what would presumably be a somewhat important position, or any position for that matter, half way across the world. Somehow they must be short of workers in China and need ours for some reason or another. Another unrealistic scenario was the portrayal of the Chinese students portraying than a group of Americanized thugs completely removed from their parents & their culture. I've been many places in the world but there's no other place on earth where respect & honor are held in such high regard and the extent of their actions are far beyond what you would even see here in the U.S., . Not only that but the script makes it seem like everyone in Beijing looks the other way when this kid is getting the crap beat out of him. It's really an insult to the Chinese culture on many levels. And are to believe that Jaden Smith's Character learned several months, if not a years, worth of Kung Fu & strength training in the matter of days, only by hanging up a jacket on a mere peg? NO, NO WAY!!! It's about as stupid as thinking you will learn a martial art from Diamond Dave, ""The Redneck Ninja"". I get they're trying to recycle the ""Wax on, Wax off"" example from the Karate Kid 1 but this is just ridiculous. As for the acting of Jaden Smith, his interaction with every cast member is flaky at best and so was his acting overall, especially with his Chinese love interest which seemed more like two 10 year olds trying to carry out a teenage relationship. As a whole, the script is downright terrible and the acting was extremely weak if not dreadful. Although it was entertaining enough and it's definitely not the worst movie I've ever seen, you should save you money & look for something else.",The Karate Kid
372,john-periv,It's actually very good.,7,13 March 2011,"I watched the Karate Kid last night and I have to admit it is a very good movie. The story is good, trying to be as close to the original as possible, but still succeeding on doing it's own thing. The characters are great, I loved Jackie Chan as Mr. Han. And Jaden Smith also does a great job as Dre. I know a lot of people won't agree with me, and say this remake is just an average film. I disagree. I really do. What I especially like about this film, more than the story and the characters, is the way they handled the element of Kung Fu.

Don't get me wrong the footage was amazing with the Jackie Chan and Jayden Smith walking up those stairs to the temple.I hate to bring more negatives but I have to, I just found the whole film TOO cheesy.

I loved the original so of course I was going to be cynical, but really I feel justified. Jaden Smith just doesn't have anything likable about him, he is annoying and I also feel that the characters are too young for the story. The scene in which the young girl dances for him is inappropriate for her age and also given their ages we don't see the same angst and array of emotions we did in the original film. A pointless remake as are so many. Do yourselves a favour and rent the original and save yourselves the horror of Jadens smarmy acting and smart Alec attitude.

I admire Jackie Chan for his skill as a martial artist, and he can be funny sometimes, but if you compare between the two, it's hands-down Mr. Miyagi. :) There was nothing wrong with this version, and the relationship between Dre and Mr. Han was good. There was just something really meaningful about Daniel and Mr.Miyagi's bond. Maybe it could be that Jaden Smith is a lot younger than Ralph Macchio was in the main role and has a little less experience or maturity, I'm not sure.Or it could possibly be that the original was for my generation and this latest one is for the next generation, which was the purpose for the remake in the first place.",The Karate Kid

I love Jackie anyway and what Jaden lacked in his acting he made up in cuteness. I could not take my eyes off of him! I love martial arts movies and I was very impressed with Jaden's skill.

377,brad-wong-322-600065,Very Good!,8,22 March 2012,"The remake of ""Karate Kid"" remains true to the overall spirit of the original, and it is so much more than the generic studio product that a lot of people, including myself, were fearing. My heart dropped when I found out that Harald Zwart, director of the Agent Cody Banks movies and The Pink Panther 2, was at the helm. Surprisingly, Zwart does a strong job of directing here, deftly avoiding the idiocy of his previous movies to craft a Karate Kid that will not only satisfy fans of the original, but will also prove to be thoroughly entertaining for those who haven't seen the original. This is a charming, funny, exciting, and, in some moments, genuinely emotional movie.The performances are solid across the board. Based on the evidence of his performance here, Jaden Smith looks likely to be just as big a star as his dad. There is nothing exceptional about Smith's performance here; the material doesn't really stretch his dramatic abilities too much. But he anchors the film with his energy and likability. This is to Jaden what Fresh Prince of Bel-Air was to Will; a chance to take centre stage and show his star potential, which there is a lot of. Taraji P. Henson excels in her underwritten role as Dre's mother, bringing honest emotion and life to a character who, over the course of the movie, we don't learn all that much about. Her scenes with Smith fully convince as a mother- son dynamic. Zhenwai Wang is about as nasty and despicable as a child actor has been for some time as Dre's main nemesis, whilst Wenwen Han brings warmth and grace to the stock role of romantic interest. Also making a deep impression with limited screen time is Rongguang Yu as Master Li, the vicious kung fu master and the teacher of Dre's bullies. Come the final fight, Yu becomes the character most likely to make the audience want to punch something. Whilst Cheng is brutal, he is a child. Li is an adult, and has greater knowledge of his actions; this makes the lengths to which he will go to to get what he wants all the more frightening and evil.Overall, an intense, excellent re-creation of the original.",The Karate Kid

Better acting and superior fight scenes. I was shocked by the range of emotions Will Smith's son showed in the film and the film had greater depth than original.I do get why people gave this film lower ratings. If you watched the original and love it, you won't get that warm buzzing feeling you got when you watch this movie. That's because films like this were fresh and new in the 1980s. In the same way The Fighter is a better film than Rocky, but you won't as excited after you seen the fighter as you got when you first saw Rocky 3 or 4.People expecting to feel the same way they felt when they watched the original as a child are going to be disappointed as that is impossible when you are 25 years older.My issue with the film was I wasn't quite sure who the film was aimed at.

Jaden is one of the worst actors I've ever seen, anywhere. Seriously. He sucked in the other movies his father put him in also. Will is a good actor, but it's obviously not hereditary.

Too aggressive for kids, especially the last fight scene, when Jaden's leg gets broken. Anyways, not a great stellar performance from Jaden as they say he proved as son of Will, etc it's all just business promotion. I went with lot of expectations, but it was below average.The photography was great, china was amazing. I liked some part of the movie and would appreciate the direction.

From what I understand of the original, both films follow the same basic story beats. It's nothing outstanding but it's a tale well told.The acting from Jaden Smith in the lead is better than I expected. He carries off the arrogant swagger of a tween who is learning he knows nothing and his dialogue delivery is perfectly natural for his age range. Jackie Chan is fantastic as Mr Han, chanelling a world weary pain and guilt we don't often see in the usually comedic actor.The martial arts are superb - with several of the actors involved already being highly trained combatants - and the location shooting and cinematography add a real feeling of place to the film.This isn't anything revolutionary, but it achieves what it sets out to do and is very entertaining.

386,optymizer,Grossly Underrated!,10,29 June 2010,"Let me start by acknowledging the fact that people's preferences are very different and I certainly understand that. What I cannot understand, however, is how this movie gets rated based on superficial things such as ""jaden can't act"", ""black kid in china"", ""smith's son got the role"", etc, etc. I am not going to claim Jaden Smith can act well. I am not an expert nor do I want to be one. All I care about is whether during the movie I believed him or not. And I did. Never in the movie did I think: ""ok, this is cheesy"" when Jaden was involved. Therefore, I am inclined to believe people that criticize his acting so heavily are in fact showing their hatred for Jaden Smith personally (for whatever reason), and did not objectively evaluate his acting. All the other ""arguments"" against Jaden are just plain old trash-talk: - ""black kid in china"": what's the big deal? yes, he's black. accept it. - ""will smith's son"".. so what? I don't think any of you rejected 100$ from your father when you were high-school and I also don't think you'll refuse to play the main role in a movie. That's life. People that shout ""nepotism"" often hear the saying ""life is unfair"", but they never truly understand it.The real problem is that some people, like myself, got used to checking the IMDb score prior to going to a movie.. and if it's in the 5 or 6 range, I'm not going to see it or at least I'll think twice before I do go. And all of you who rated this movie because of superficial reasons like the ones outlined above, just make it difficult for us to make a well-informed decision. Personally, I would give this movie a solid 8, because I enjoyed it, because it didn't feel rushed, because it presented the rich culture of China and because they showed some neat martial art tricks. I don't think it's worth 10/10 because the kid's mother was indeed cheesy (what mother cheers for her son when his leg is broken?) and because of various disconnects in the movie. BUT, I strongly believe the humor and acting in this movie should place this movie in the 7-8 range and that is why I rated it at 10.Conclusion: Go see it!

387,azm_ahmad,Simple is Beautiful,10,23 July 2010,"I never wanted to write a review for this movie. I am not in the habit of belaboring the obvious and I respect other people's opinion. I usually don't recommend movies to my friends -- even if they ask me to. They have their own tastes and sensibilities and they may like or dislike a movie of which I have thought otherwise. Public opinion doesn't make me change my opinion and I am not anxious to have everyone share my point of view.Enough is enough already. This is supposed to be a review.But the reason I have harped on so long about my temperament and way of thinking is that I wanted to make it clear that I am not reactive to people's opinions. Some of the reviews of this movie, however, made me react.I do not understand why so many of the people had given this movie so negative reviews (considerably more have given it excellent reviews though). I cannot comprehend what were these people looking for when they went to see it: education, enlightenment, high-concept, philosophy of a lifetime or simply entertainment? In my opinion, this movie can be seen for several reasons, for example: You can watch this movie for Jackie Chan, the eternal star.You can watch this movie for Jaden Smith. Curiosity factor, you know? 'Lets see how the Smith kid has done' kind of thing.You can watch this film because it is the remake of a classic of your youthful days.Or you can watch this film simply because you want to be entertained. And that's the real point of this film. It entertains you and does so without being cheap or 'lofty'.If you want to find an emotional identification with this film, you may try the bullying aspect, 'fish out of water' aspect, or the father-son, student-teacher relationship aspect.This is a beautiful movie made in a very simple manner. And it proves, yet again, that simple is beautiful.",The Karate Kid
388,DrooRadley,A remake that actually surpasses the original,8,9 June 2010,"The remake takes the basic plot of the original 1984 film and makes just a few cosmetic changes to it. The main character, instead of a white teenager (named Daniel-san) who moves from Jersey to California, is now a black 12 year-old (named Dre Parker) that moves from Detroit to China. Instead of learning karate from an old Japanese guy, he learns kungfu from Jackie Chan. And you wouldn't be the first to then ask ""why isn't it called the Kungfu kid then?"" But really, does it matter? The fighting style is different, but the soul of the movie, I'm happy to report, is the same.Something that occurred to me early on was that in the movie poster and opening credits, Jaden Smith gets top billing. Yeah, he's playing the eponymous character and all, and he did a pretty good job in Pursuit of Happiness, but the other guy is Jackie Chan, a legendary superstar in both the Eastern and Western movie scene! There were so many ways where Smith could've gone wrong: he could've easily just played it easy and just been a shallow character throwing Fresh Prince attitude around in an Asian society (like Lil Bow Wow in Tokyo Drift), but he instead channeled a truly frightened and vulnerable little boy. And that's why he earns that top billing.From the opening scene where he and his mother are moving out of Detroit, Smith just sucks you in with his innocence and sweetness. No macho bravado; just a kid who's sad he's leaving his home. And here he sidesteps another landmine – he could've just been this mopey kid channeling sad puppy-dog eyes for the entire movie like Frodo, but when he meets the cute Chinese girl that snags his heart, the charming Fresh Prince genes in him comes out to play.In the original movie, Daniel-san was a teenager who moved interstate. Smith's character is a kid who moved to a completely different country. As an American kid in China who can barely speak a word of Chinese, he is not only even more isolated, but his age also means he is less able to deal with the dramatic change in lifestyle. He's scared, he's lonely, and you can see this on his face even before the bully makes his entrance and smacks the crap out of him.And here is why Smith is such a good young actor. A lot of actors are afraid to look like scared little wimps on camera because it's not very glam, but Smith goes there. He goes way out there, and you will see on the screen a scared little boy who's barely holding it together. And this is where the movie really works, and this is why Jaden Smith really earns his top billing. Dre Parker is more likable than Daniel-san, and Smith does the scared little boy character so well that your heart will just crack into a hundred pieces for him. Daniel-san fought in that tournament because he's the underdog and he wants to put the bully in his place, but Dre fights because he doesn't want to be afraid anymore. And because of this one key factor, this deeper connection with the protagonist, I think the new film is a lot better than the original, iconic it may be.And as for the fight sequences, it's both brutal and stylish, and not only does it surpass the original in terms of stunt work, but it can really hold its own against other kungfu movies. And these are little kids that are fighting too! I'm not going to spoil it, but wait till you see Jaden Smith's version of the Crane Kick. It's awesome.How does Jackie Chan compare with Pat Morita? Well, Jackie Chan made a career for himself by playing the bumbling clown who can also do crazy stunts. In this movie, he only fights once, and he plays a more subdued and serious role. And while Smith's acting clearly outshines Chan's, it is actually pretty good to see Jackie Chan just play a regular guy. His surrogate father relationship with Smith played out extremely well, and you can see quite a good chemistry between the two. Chan's side-story about his family is one of the weaker parts of the story, but it doesn't detract much from the story.Rounding off the coming-of-age stories in this movie is of course, the love arc involving the Chinese girl. The scenes of Dre trying to Romeo the girl were so funny and sincere that it really didn't feel like fluff in between the cool fight scenes at all. This arc was more than just a reason for Dre to enter the tournament to fight the bully, because the blossoming relationship between the two really showed his character growing from a boy to a young man. It reminded you of childhood innocence, and once again made Smith's character so much more real.The movie is far from perfect though, with a few moments that just pulls you out and makes you go ""what the hell?"" Like Dre's mother, for example. I don't care how proud of your son you are, but when your boy is getting beat within inches of his life, you don't cheer for him to get up. And while I can buy how good Dre becomes at kungfu under Jackie Chan's tutelage, there are just some things he does in the tournament that are way too impressive and makes you ask ""when did he learn that?"" But these moments are few and far between, and it only takes you out of the experience for a few seconds before you get back into the exciting ride.When this movie was announced, I didn't think it was necessary to remake the 1984 movie. But now that I've seen it, I'm glad they did because for once, the remake surpasses the sequel.",The Karate Kid
389,lil_will87902,Basically it was all about the action,8,28 June 2010,"Having LOVED the original Karate Kid for not only it's story but also for the action, I wasn't expecting much from this movie, especially after all the other remakes prior, which were awful. But, like with so many other things, I was wrong. This movie was extremely entertaining. This being Jaden's third movie, I was not expecting grade A acting. But he did do a decent job delivering lines and connecting with the story, he was a likable character. However, I did not feel a connection between any of the characters, even the love interest. But anyway, Jackie Chan, as always, was a joy to watch on screen. He played the role of a good mentor very well. Also this was one of the first times I have seen him take on a less lively and more serious role, as I am used to him being funny as with Rush Hour. But his acting was believable and helped the story. But the main part, and basically the only part that allows me to give this movie an 8 was the action. The fight scenes were absolutely phenomenal. The choreography was seamless and very well done. In the original movie, yeah there were fight sequences, but they are always simplistic moves, and short anti-climactic fights. This movie had some amazing young fighters, they were professional and the fights looked very real and very good. Also I loved that we saw more of the training of the protagonist than in the original, that was very interesting. Also the ""villains"" in this film were to be honest, quite scary. Those kids were such talented fighters and were very intimidating. This is a movie I highly recommend",The Karate Kid

391,m_magnificent568,Loved it! 10/10,10,18 June 2010,"I don't understand why some people think that Jackie Chan did not live up to Pat Morita's character, Mr. Miyagi? I mean, Jackie Chan is a TRUE martial arts master while Pat Morita (with respect) is just an actor playing the part of a martial arts master. I thought Jackie Chan was great and so was Jaden Smith. The fighting scenes from start to end were remarkable. Even Jaden made it look believable. I can say that the boys in this remake can whoop butts better than the teenagers in the original movie.As for the original, I always thought the fighting scenes were tacky, stiff, and unbelievable. Still, I liked it nevertheless...because there was a nice storyline to it and the hero (Daniel) was pretty cute. Before I took my kids to watch this new movie, I rented the original. They didn't even want to watch it with me!! They said the movie was too old and Daniel, who once was my heartthrob, looked like a girl!! But when we watched the new one with Jaden and Jackie, they loved it! My little girl now has the biggest crush on Jaden.Anyway, this newer version is not remade to make the fans of the original movie happy. It was remade so that our younger generation can bask in the same entertainment that we once did when we first saw the original. Even as a fan of the original, I thoroughly enjoyed it.PS - Who cares about the title being ""The Karate Kid"". In my book, it is one of my favorite movies this year.",The Karate Kid

394,aronsonstack,Crane kick versus Cobra kick!,9,12 June 2010,"I grew up watching the Karate Kid, Back to the Future, all that good 80's stuff, but I'm not one to be biased and not give the remakes a chance. Now, I loved the original Karate Kid, but if you grew up with the Karate Kid, then you must have grown up with ""Black Belt Theater"" too. As a 9 year old kid, I was disappointed with the fight scenes in the original having been spoiled with all the Kung-Fu dub flicks that Black Belt theater presented every Saturday afternoon. However, I've watched the original again many times as an adult who knows how to critic a movie and not just judge it on fight scenes like a 9 year old would and have to appreciate it even more! I saw the new one last night and immediately something happened that the old version never was able to do to me. What it did to me was it made me had to hold back my tears. Maybe Daniel Larusso was too big of a kid, so I never felt that much pain for him when he got beat up, but Dre was a a real little kid, and in the first scene when he got messed up. He kept getting back up, but with tears falling down his face like any kid would, and damn, anybody who has a little brother or child, I guarantee you'll be crying, or at least trying to hold back your tears when you see that scene. Those of you who think that the kids in this movie are too young to be taken seriously, really need to see it first. The villain pose a real threat to Dre and that's all that matters. Once you feel Dre is in a bad place, then the protagonist and antagonist mechanism is working. Audience of all ages for this version will not be disappointed with the fight scenes. In the original, I thought Lawrence was the dumbest person on earth just to lean his face forward so Daniel Larusso can crane kick his face. In this version, the finale kick is the Cobra, and the villain is not unrealistically dumb as Lawrence, there are a few movements before Dre can deliver the kick. Besides for location and fighting style, they pretty much stuck to the script. Often times, remakes change this and that, but they pretty much stuck to the script. No mercy, no pain, break his leg, finish him, Dre is gonna fight, please fix me Mr. Han, it is all in there!! Jaden Smith's acting could have used some improvement but I fault the writers more. For example, the end scene in the locker room, Dre dramatically tells Mr. Han all the reasons why he wants to get back out there and dramatically questions WHY WON'T YOU HELP ME? Well, there was no dialog from Mr. Han that indicated he wasn't going to help him. So some of this isn't Jaden's fault. Some people will hate on Jaden Smith because they feel it's nepotism, I say grow up! Probably 75% of Hollywood is nepotism or having connections, so why don't you boycott the whole industry. Anyway, I thoroughly enjoyed this new version. The ""adolescent"" love story is cute, you can take your children and not cringe at anything.",The Karate Kid
395,traciwaugh,We loved it!!!,8,30 April 2020,"I agree completely with the last reviewer: I don't understand why all the negativity for Jaden Smith. His acting is great. He's very natural and convincing. And he obviously learned all of the Kung Fu moves himself. No one was doing them for him.My family and I just watched this during the Covid-19 quarantine. Our 9- and 10-year olds really got into it. We all did. We would highly recommend this movie. Not only does the Kid deal with the bullies in the right way, he also deals with his girlfriend's dad's rejection of him in a brave and admirable way.Not to mention, this movie has a great cast and beautiful scenery!",The Karate Kid
396,tianartist,"Great Movie: Interesting, Exciting, Culturally Competent and just plain enjoyable!",10,27 June 2010,"I think this was an excellent movie. I saw it last night; it was just plain great! I think the plot was interesting and definitely relates to America's current economy and the things that are on everyone's minds: jobs & changing world views as well as hitting on some universal concerns: finding peace within oneself, standing up for oneself, making friends, learning to respect others and learning from one's mistakes.I truly think this one of those unique movies that children AND adults can fully appreciate.I thought the script was interesting. I think they paid homage to the original Karate Kid without directly copying or making a mockery of it. And I REALLY liked that various cultures were represented in the film.I'm excited to see more films from the lovely Jaden and excited to see more from the legendary Jackie Chan as well! As a side note: The audience we sat with was fully captivated; young and old, Black and White, we all laughed uproariously, cheered loudly, groaned, and there were even a few tears. There aren't many movies today that bring an audience together like that.",The Karate Kid
397,amclellan84,Horrible embarrassment to the epic classic.,1,4 August 2010,"This is the worst remake of any film. The old Karate Kid is an epic, emotional, and an extremely powerful film. Mr Miyagi was an unbelievable character and made the film very special. And of course the reason why the old film worked was because of it being believable in terms of Daniel and the rest of the fighters.So, the new film...Jaden Smith is a great little actor, and he gives a good performance in this film. But the film is terrible, primarily because he is a little boy. He is a little boy fighting with other little boys. Now if you are 10 years old and you haven't seen the old Karate Kid, then maybe this is what the 3 Ninjas was to me.... a fun little film with some cool moves. But as stated, the old Karate kid is an epic film, and it is loved by all ages. It's not supposed to be a stupid little Disney-style film for 10 year olds, and younger. I mean Jackie Chan fighting with 10 year olds? C'mon! A loser with no fighting skills could have thrown all those kids about himself.It's disappointing that Will and Jada thought this was a good idea. Even though Jaden acts very well in it, it's just not how it should be done. I'd probably go as far as to say this is the worst remake of any film I've ever seen.",The Karate Kid

Having seen the original, i feel that they did an excellent job at paying tribute to the classic Karate Kid, while making it feel like something new. I have to admit that I was a little skeptical when I saw that Jayden Smith was going to be the lead, but he did a great job with the roll, Jackie Chan surprised me a little, he's acting is much better than in previous films. All the kids in this movie did an amazing job, I loved the scenery and cinematography. This is a great movie to see with the entire family. To all you haters, grow up, enjoy the movie for what it is, not for what you think it should have been.",The Karate Kid

400,fpmmhexz,Cool,9,21 January 2021,"Come on, you guys! This is definitely an enhanced version. You just don't get it. Yes, a classic is a classic, nothing beats a classic. But this an advanced retelling of the original film. Something worth appreciating. One of the reviews states that the casting is poor, nothing is the same as the original, no humility, acting sucks and so on.First of all, the casting is perfect! You may not be really happy with Jaden for whatever reason but he did his best, or tried. The Chinese actors, most especially the kids, did act naturally. And you are all forgetting Taraji! She's truly a natural! And come on! It's Jackie Chan!!!! You all don't like Jackie Chan???? You do realize that he is a comedian, right!? But here, he was able to execute the drama that is just needed. Probably not all but some, at least.Second is that this remake pretty much shows an ensemble for the cast. In the original, Ali, Daniel's love interest, did not have any particulars about herself except for being in a wealthy family and some mentioning of the stuff she does. But here, Dre's young lady was given a special part of what she's into which is music- playing violin. And the dancing, too!This retelling of the original story shows where the specifics came from. The balance that Mr. Miyagi kept mentioning is the Yin Yang of the Ancient Chinese philosophy that is uncovered here. The formation or style or figure that Daniel did or used before he kicked Johnny resembles a snake- a cobra snake, ironically; and again, the origin was shown here. And didn't you like the idea of Dre's jacket that has something to do with his mom getting really upset when he forgets to hang it? Taraji delivered the performance just superb in a way that you enjoyed laughing or whatever! I find that real fun.I think one of the most interesting stuff here is that Will Smith and his group of producers managed to fly to China where karate was derived / originated from. Well, inspired by none other than Kung Fu. In other words, the Japanese version of Chinese Kung Fu.And there's just a lot of fighting here. A lot of action. A lot of moves. A variety of choreography. More advanced. Latest. Modern. Cool.",The Karate Kid

The plot was similar to the Karate Kid but wasn't as good, some scenes are really unrealistic. The title was inappropriate as the Mc learns kungfu.

This simple story isn't padded out well which exacerbates, and emphasises, the plots lack of depth. *(interesetingly not karate, possible the biggest plot twist of the film)Acting/Characters Although there where no *groan* moments the acting really wasn't that special. I'm a Jackie Chan fan but it's clear this was not a role he was cut out for and he was the standout performance for an otherwise quite poor cast.Martial arts This was perhaps the one redeeming feature of this film and certainly for child actors the action scenes weren't bad but for my money, fights between 13 year-olds are difficult to really get behind (its hard to see an audience really cheering for one kid to beat another up it just doesn't seem right). This is a particular problem for this film as its really the backbone of the film and its engagement with the audience.The result of which is a film which is very unengaging which has little other reason to watch it. This is a shame as, relative to other films of this calibre, clearly a lot of effort an money has gone into this film, easily enough to make a half decent film.Summary: If you want to see Martial arts this isn't bad but there are many better martial arts films out there. If you are after a drama, underdog story etc this really isn't the film for you",The Karate Kid
405,donwilseone,So poor,2,31 August 2010,"This film is poor on every level, Story, Script, Acting. I will concede, as anther reviewer has already stated, that the cinematography is good but it plays a bit too much like a tourist promotional video for China.I was not a fan of the original as it was to camp, but I really wanted to like this. I thought Jaden Smith put in a fantastic performance in 'The Pursuit Of Happiness' and I was hoping he would bring an heir of integrity to this film but he just looked bored throughout the entire film. I am also a fan of Jackie Chan but he also just doesn't look interested in this film.Everyone knows the basic story; kid is bullied taken under the wing of strange old man taught how to fight enters tournament to face down bully. If they had stuck with that basic story they could have shaved at least 50 minutes of this film, but instead, they made some half hearted attempts of a back story for Jackie Chan's character and a romance for Jaden Smith's character, which do not add in any way to the story. 2 hours and 20 minutes far too long.As for fight scenes, I have to totally disagree with several of the other reviewers, there are very few fight scenes and what fight scenes there are, are short and poorly choreographed.Just to be clear I am not a racist, although it seems to be a common topic on the message boards that you must be a racist if you dislike this movie.I cannot believe they are making a sequel!!!!",The Karate Kid
406,nadinee_711,The Kung Fu Kid! Definitely worth the watch...,7,13 June 2010,"If anyone was against the remake of The Karate Kid it was me. Mr Miyagi is a Hollywood icon that can never be replaced. Fortunately, the remake succeeds by avoiding doing just that. Instead, The Karate Kid chooses to breathe life into new characters to create a story that allows the audience to feel that rush of excitement that made the original such a classic. Jaden Smith finally steps out into a role I could support. This is the first time that his performance overshadows his name. He earned this part and if the buzz surrounding this movie doesn't convince you, I assure you that two and a half hours later you will have no doubt. The movie is a little longer than necessary and at times tries to accomplish too much (i.e. the character of Harry), but overall achieves its goals. Definitely worth the watch.",The Karate Kid
407,JustSarahToday,An Entertaining Film that Honors the Original,8,14 June 2010,"I went to see ""The Karate Kid"" more out of boredom than anything else. I was surprised to see that the film was not only very entertaining, but also pays homage to the original.The story centers around a young African American boy named Dre Parker (Smith) who has moved to China when his mother (Henson) is transferred. Dre finds China to be overwhelming to say the least and comes across trouble when a group of bullies decide to make him their new target. The bullies come after Dre one afternoon and he is rescued by the maintenance man, Mr. Han (Chan). Dre is impressed with Mr. Han's aptitude for Kung Fu and asks that Mr. Han teach him. Han refuses until he see's the school that the bullies train at. The Master of this school teaches the martial art along with an extra dose of cruelty. The Master challenges Dre to fight one of his students but Han (knowing full well that Dre would lose) insists that they fight at the up-coming Kung Fu tournament. The Master agrees and the duel is set. The remainder of the film is centered around Dre's training and the development of a ""father/son"" bond between him and Mr. Han.The plot of the movie is well organized and doesn't stray from it's purpose. The side stories stay well within reach and do not out shine the main idea.The acting in this movie was more than I expected. Jackie Chan does a fine job of acting out the reclusive and almost hermit, Mr. Han while Jaden Smith shows that he is indeed an entertainer. Some of the other characters (such as the bullies and master) may be a little over done at times but I suspect the film was trying to set up very black and white boundaries.One aspect of the film that I could not get over was the BEAUTIFUL scenery. The art directors took advantage of the green hills, astonishing architecture and exotic culture. It blended smoothly into the film while still standing out. Even if the acting was horrible and the plot was messed up, one could still enjoy the film just because of the intricate scenery shots.When I say that the film payed homage to the original I mean to say that it took the iconic moments (such as ""wax on, wax off"") and made them its own. Of course the film is using a different martial art but I feel the title portrays more of the spirit of the film than whether the character is learning Kung Fu or Karate.The film is definitely a fun movie and an entertaining show but goes above and beyond to create something new while retaining touches of the original.******** out of 10 stars.",The Karate Kid
408,stuart-moulder,Better than the original,8,14 June 2010,"I think nostalgia colors our perceptions of many things we remember fondly from our youth. The Karate Kid is one of those films. The original was fun - better than expected given the talent. But not a great film. This remake isn't a great movie either, but it is made with more craft than the original and with a deeper emotional resonance. Jaden Smith does a fine job as the main character. The interplay between he and his mother feels genuine (kudos to Taraji Henson for her work as Jaden's Mom). But the real gem here is Jackie Chan. He out-Myagi's Mr. Myagi and really delivers an effecting and moving performance. And yes, after the last several films he has been in, this is quite a surprise. I hope Jackie takes this as an opportunity to move forward in his career and embrace more mature roles. He can handle them. The other ""star"" of the movie is China itself. Both urban and rural China are shown to great effect and the movie is richly textured and vibrant because of it.For fans of fighting action and Jackie Chan's style of fight/stunt sequences, there is some decent stuff here, but only a bit of it. Jackie gets one full on fight scene and delivers (of course). Jaden Smith gets the bulk of the fighting scenes and handles them very well.As others have noted, this is a good film for families. I took my nine year old daughter and sixteen year old son and both enjoyed it. One caveat, the fight scenes are convincingly brutal at times and so may not be appropriate for younger children.",The Karate Kid
409,chuckles77-2,Simply Awful,1,11 June 2010,"This is what happens when a mom and dad want their son to star in a movie with very little prior acting credits: become co-producers and push through a ridiculous story so that he can headline it. So much for the whole idea of earning and working your way towards starring in a motion picture. It's unfortunate that this form of entitlement overshadows the film itself, but the sad fact is that is exactly the case.It's clear that it was far more important to give the Smith's son a starring role, than to actually attempt to make a decent film. Calling the movie ""The Karate Kid"" (at least here in the U.S.) when it was kung-fu? Jackie Chan's character fighting a bunch of pre-teens? Jaden Smith does not perform well here--but why should we expect him to be? He wasn't cast because of his talent, but because of who he's related to.The original ""Karate Kid"" has not aged all that well, granted. But it's popularity was due to it's relatability, since all of us know of the hardships of high school. But by moving it to China, and changing the age of the characters to be pre-teens, the movie creates a disconnect from it's audience.Avoid this vanity project for Will Smith. In these difficult economic times it's hard to justify paying money to see a film where the star got the part, not through hard work and paying his dues, but by simply being born into the right family.",The Karate Kid
410,CAT21,Failure once again.............,5,28 June 2010,"I hate the new phenomenon occurring in Hollywood where every old film and song is getting remade. Why the losers in Hollywood can't come up with anything new, fresh and original is beyond me considering there extremely overpaid for the unimportant things they do and you'd figure guys making millions per film could at least come up with something original. Just goes to show anyone can be a Hollywood film producer these days.Anyway, The Karate Kid remake is basically a remix of the original first Karate Kid film. While we can all remember the classic clearly from our childhoods if you're old enough of course, this film is not as memorable. In my opinion, when you remake a film it loses something that I can't describe. How many remakes were better than the original? Can't answer? That's because it's never been done!!!Anyway, I'm sure Will Smith is happy to have launched his son's career and I'm also sure Jaden will be richer than most of us by the time he's 18, regardless of abilities or acting skill because he's Will Smith's kid. In the film, he did an OK job to keep things amusing, but I just couldn't wrap my head around some of the subtle changes they made and that the originality factor is lost: -The new ""John Kreese"" replacement didn't seem as mean or hateful and accepted his defeat in the tournament too well. Remember Kreese in KK2 choking Johnny for failing and punching his student in the face when he asked Kreese to let Johnny go. In comparison, the new master only slapped that kid in the face when he didn't finish his attack. -The students bowing to Jackie Chan was unbelievable, whereas Johnny and his crew seemed meaner and more convincing and never would have bowed to Mr. Miyagi. -These kids were deadly killers skill-wise next to Johnny and his friends. When Shen kicked Dre in his chest before Jackie showed up, that kick, along with the beating he took should have landed him in the hospital. Daniel in the original film was bigger than Dre and yet Daniel had a black eye and believable injuries whereas Dre took a savage beating in comparison without a scratch. -They should have kept things in the US. Going to China made no sense.Overall, this movie should be retitled ""Karate Kid Lite"".",The Karate Kid
411,StanleyLWalker,"Charming, Daring and Undeniably Human",10,15 June 2010,"I really enjoyed this film. The scenery is beautiful. The actors are great and charming. The young lead has charisma to spare and I think he has a great future ahead of him. The action choreography is amazing. I also really enjoyed the scoring of the film. The pop music (US and Asian alike) is memorable and the scenes they cover really come alive. The music enhances what is there and you will likely still be bopping your head to a number of the tunes whilst enjoying a mental montage from the film. Jackie Chan as always is 100% Awesome. Chan and Smith are impressively fearless in their portrayals of the complex emotions their characters go through, emotions that are often taboo in our Patriarchal culture. It is a great retelling of an 80s fave and really benefits from the huge screen. The only criticism I have is the ""romance"". They are twelve. I think they could have left out the kiss and such.",The Karate Kid
412,misterthi-1,"To Haters: If you are still hung up on the title, you need new excuses.",7,16 June 2010,"I've had an IMDb account for a while now. But I never really felt like writing a review until now. Being a young film maker, I've always thought my movie barometer was at least good. After watching the Karate Kid and loving it, I expected at least a 6 out of 10 on IMDb. I was shocked by other reviewers hating it. ""Why?"" I thought, ""Why are they stupid?""Seriously, there had to be a reason why some people give it one star. I began to read the haters' reviews. While some of them had very valid points, most of them were sticklers that hated out of spite. Big fans of the original were hating for the sake of hating. You can tell because they made critiques that wanted the movie to be both the same and different. ""The movie carried the same story line, why doesn't it try to be different?"" followed by ""The movie sucked! Why couldn't it be just like the original?""As a fan of both the old and new, I hope to shed some light. The cinematography was great for a family movie remake. I loved some of the lighting and symbolism done by the set designer and DP.The story was very much like the original but had very key differences. Expanding on Jackie Chan's character's past was a great decision. It added more depth to a very old one dimensional character. Another good change was the setting of China. It allowed the director to introduce the new face of China to the world as well as develop a bigger feeling of isolation for Jaden Smith's character.I do have to address some of the haters' comments more specifically though. I do agree that the scene with the Dragon well was totally unnecessary(making the movie a little long) and a bit racist. A kung fu village in the mountains containing a well with a yin yang symbol on it called the ""dragon well"" is super stereotypical and super inaccurate.I think the biggest beef people have is the title. Calling the movie ""Karate Kid"" when it is about kung fu is a bit misleading.....If you are stupid. The movie itself and the previews addressed the misnomer. If you have half a brain and an ounce of compassion, you'd realize and forgive the producers for trying to pay homage to the original as well as draw old fans to watch the remake. I do recall some people saying that the love interest was very awkward. It was. It was also done on purpose. 12 year old romances are awkward as they are. Try being a 12 year old black kid new to china and contracting yellow fever. I'd be very suspicious if the romance went smoothly.The movie is good and I recommend watching it. If you choose to review it afterwards, be honest with your rating and use your head.",The Karate Kid
413,aka-cool,Karate Kid stands up with high standards,10,11 June 2010,"Cinema and the underdog have made a delightful couple. Cinema has ensured that the underdog mostly wins, while the underdog stories have usually ensured a good box office run.In ""The Karate Kid"", we witness the rebirth of the ultimate American teenage underdog story.Popular Detroit kid Dre Parker (Jaden Smith) finds himself in China after his mother's transfer. From day one he gets bullied and beaten by a kung-fu kid Li, till the maintenance man Mr. Han (Jackie Chan) comes to his rescue, menacing his opponents without even raising a punch.When Han and Dre go to Li's Kung Fu class to tell the kids to lay off him, Li's instructor threatens them. Han finds a way out by telling him that Dre will fight his students, but in the open Kung Fu tournament.Han now trains Dre, but frustrates him. It's only when Han demonstrates that kung fu lies in everything that he begins to understand. As expected, the underdog wins, but not after getting over insurmountable odds on the way.Director Harald Zward does not fail the popular original. He takes efforts in painting his characters with different shades of life and pain. What is, however, most interesting is the film's politics.Throughout history Hollywood has excelled in bashing up America's enemy nations in cinema - Germany during the world wars and Russia during the Cold War. Right now, if there's any nation that is a threat, it is China.""The Karate Kid"" plays with America's anti-China sentiment by having an average black kid go to the heart of the China, and beat them in their own game. The kid in the original film was white. Here it is a black kid, symbolising the presidency of Barack Obama, who is determined to 'kick ass' of China.Papa (Will) Smith and Mama (Jada Pinkett) Smith (producers of the film) have found their son's career the perfect 'silver-platter' start, unlike their own acting careers which is a true underdog story.Sadly, you'll not see much of Chan's wonderful fight choreography that has made even the worst films enjoyable. Make no mistakes, it is a film for and of Jaden Smith, and so far in his three films, he has definitely not disappointed audiences.Just go and watch. U will definitely enjoy it .",The Karate Kid
414,milly3333,Shocking,1,10 August 2010,"Went to see this last night in the cinema, and ohh no I cannot believe they have yet again ruined another movie. To begin, what was the point in calling it Karate Kid it was kung Fu! Call it something else. The fighting also in the movie, they are saying that you learn Kung Fu for yourself not to fight and clearly many of the scenes were about hurting someone. Bad form for a kids movie i can imgine the amount of kids watching it who think oh yeah I can flip my sister or brother over my head and they fall on their back and they will be fine. Really thought the violence was a little bit much, in the original yes there were fight scenes but never to this nature. Plus mm why are the kids so young in it found that really odd a little sad. Wills son too not the correct role for him at all he just comes across as annoying and cocky. What was with the wall of China also they just tried to do too much with such a simple and perfect movie to begin with in the first place. Lots of silly mistakes in the movie too, where does Dre school bag go too when he throws the bucket of skunk over the bullies head, and how did he get a new change of clothes when going to the puppet show I have more but I will say nought. The end was just the icing on the cake, first why would a tournament be held where all the kids are different ages some of them were toddlers, then if the moves the badies done were real then they would have been disqualified, the stupid kick not even possible for a human to do it and the silly eye thing I think thats when I nearly cried in pain... If companies are so made into their remakes why not just re-release the older version of the movies get a lot more for them",The Karate Kid
415,thieniscool,Like it - or - Hate it,7,16 June 2010,"Before watching this movie, I read the reviews online and there has been a harsh division between 1 and 10 rating. Honestly, this movie does not deserve a 1 or a 10, whether it is: Acting, Cinematography, Music, or Story.Objectively, I think this movie is worth watching. Definitely not the worst, but not the best. Its content is interesting and is a visible step above the original Karate Kid, even though this movie does not feel like a remake (so stop comparing >0).The movie entertained and left me with a satisfied reminiscence of the experience.",The Karate Kid
416,randomvietguy,A comparison of the old and new,6,9 July 2010,"The Karate Kid (2010) serves as a remake of the old one from 1984. The old version has quite a dedicated cult following and there have been a good deal of criticisms made about the new one and I'd just like to address them here.ACTING: I must say that the old Karate Kid wins hands down right here. Many people praise Jaden Smith for his role, but really it was NOT a good performance. It was indeed bad acting, but I can't expect too much as he is very young, but even for a child actor he is still only average at best. Ralph Macchio wasn't necessarily ""award winning"" but he is still much better than Jaden.Now as for the mentor/teacher role Jackie Chan did very good. He is just as likable as Pat Morita was in the original and I'd say they were both great in their parts.BELIEVABILILTY: Now when it comes to the believability of the plots, I'd say the old version wins again (both are rather very unbelievable though, don't get me wrong). The ""spike"" of skill Dre got was absolutely ridiculous when he was training in kung-fu. Daniel's training made more sense, as he was taught very basic techniques through the wax-on wax-off, paint the fence, etc. The jacket on and off thing didn't work as it just didn't seem to make sense physically.As the tournaments come around in both movies though, they both hit an weird point. It really doesn't make sense that someone who trained only a little can beat people who have trained a lot. However, this is part of the movies, and I'm pretty sure that is the way it is intended.Oh, and as for the main characters getting injured during the tournament, the old version makes a LOT more sense. In the old one, he was badly injured, but due to Miyagi's treatment, he was able to cope with it, but he was obviously still limping and in a little pain. In the new one Dre gets pretty badly injured but yet gets up and is magically able to fight just like before, as if nothing happened, and is even able to do a backflip like it's nothing.MARTIAL ARTS: Obviously the new Karate Kid wins here, as it was made in moderner times where Hollywood knows how to choreograph and stylize fighting scenes. The old Karate Kid only featured very basic techniques and fighting (however, in this sense it is a lot more believable).One thing to note though is that the original Karate Kid was never ABOUT the action or fighting scenes. The new one is very obviously stylized and everything to make crowds go ""Woooo!"" and such.The tournament fighting at the end of the new version features a lot of ""cool looking"" fighting, while in the older one they just do some basic kicking and punching. If you've ever seen sparring matches or actual tournaments, you would know that the older version gets it right.GENERAL: The new version of The Karate Kid is somewhat of a popcorn-flick, but not entirely. The fighting scenes were stylized and slow-mo'd and everything to be crowd pleasers and make people go ""OMG! THO COOL!"" It is not entirely a popcorn-flick though, as it retains some of the core plot elements in the original.MY RATING: I give it some deductions due to the acting, and some more due to the popcorn-flickness of it.Final score = 6/10",The Karate Kid
417,leonhaddad,Exact copy?,6,19 July 2010,"Before I watched this movie, I made the mistake watching the original Karate Kid only 2 days prior. Normally I probably wouldn't have noticed it, but now it was obvious that the script writers were lacking inspiration. This movie is almost an exact copy of the first one and includes a dozen of the exact same dialogs. I understand that it's a remake but to use the exact same dialogs? Too bad because overall it was an entertaining movie and I always like watching Jackie Chan. If you haven't seen the Karate Kid, plz go watch this movie and have a good time. If you did see it only a couple of days ago like I did, wait a while before spending your money on this one.",The Karate Kid
418,a_cossairt2009,Screw the Haters,9,28 October 2019,"If you're comparing it to the original, you've missed the point. It's its own movie. Let it be that. Some said it was predictable. Yeah? So is EVERY movie. I can tell you the outcome of like 98% of movies, twists and all... Doesn't cheapen the movie though. I thought it was a good movie it it's own right. The only negative I have to say is it should've been ""Kungfu Kid""",The Karate Kid
419,thetheori,This Film is Exceptional - Ignore the Negativity,10,12 June 2010,"First and foremost if you see D and F reviews, they did NOT see this movie. This film was exceptional in every aspect. It sticks true to the Karate Kid formula, while taking a life of its own. This is not a remake, its a re-telling.Visuals - The entire film is shot on location. (no green screens) It show the beauty and ugliness of China perfectly. The camera shots were typically timely and the editing gave the sense of Dre's (Jaden Smith) desperation. The wide shooting style enhanced the idea of his feeling of isolation in a huge and over crowded country. Especially breathtaking were the scenic shots of China giving contrast to the crowded city views.Direction - Jackie Chan has never been in a movie that gave as much thought to every single scene as this one. Every scene had purpose. The fight scenes weren't just to show off moves and advances in wire choreo. There was a story being told with each fight, and to see such young performers successfully convey such intensity was a breath of fresh air. Especially given the accolades that are given for such shallow performers these days. Particularly poignant was the use of every day objects to symbolize the characters potential/struggle. (jaden's coat/pools of water , Jackie's Car)Acting - Jaden was ELEVEN YEARS OLD when he shot this. Give the kid a break. Yes he is very raw, and he still needs to learn how not to anticipate his co-stars lines. But he is also talented and has a much better grasp of nuance than his father did when he broke into acting (at age 22). He is charming and able to go from adorable to agitating instantly. Still you find yourself drawn to him as a character. Jackie frankly gives the best performance of his life. I am an AVID Jackie Chan fan and I have seen nearly his entire body of work. He has never acted so well. The underlying sense of loss as a motivating factor was well perceivable throughout the film. He carried out the role of surrogate father flawlessly. The emotional reveal was pitch perfect. *** Notes and Summation***I loved how they touched on racism between minorities without sounding like an after school special or being anti-anyone. Yes they call it Karate Kid and he does Kung-Fu. So what. Its called artistic license. Most of the fighting in the original came from several different disciplines as well. Will did help his son get this role (that's what a father should do). But, Jaden earned it. You can tell he worked hard for this. His physical conditioning and form showed. Because his father is famous and wealthy doesn't mean that he can't have dedication and commitment to his craft. This was a solid movie. I loved it from top to bottom. I hope that Will continues to mentor and guide Jaden on to bigger and better. Jackie did an awesome job and I hope he continues to influence more young actors. Great great movie.",The Karate Kid
420,kinglion_anton,A 2-thumbs up movie indeed.,10,22 July 2010,Never thought of a remake so different from the original but so good that you may want to forget the original. Not saying that the original is not good. I'm only saying that i think it surpasses the original a little bit because of it's charisma. The young ones can relate not like the original where a teen plays the role of a kid. A classic movie of a kung fu master and his student. The movie is so moving that it made me teary-eyed.Jackie Chan is a superhero. you might not agree but he really is. Been waiting for a movie like this for quite some time. Finally got one. Hands up to this movie! Worth watching! Satisfaction guaranteed!,The Karate Kid
421,aka-seth,Moderately entertaining,6,12 September 2010,"To be honest I would have probably given the movie a better rating if it had a better title. How can you call a movie 'Karate Kid' when it's set in China and is based around the topic of King Fu as opposed to Karate? The formula is pretty much the same as the original, they've lifted all the key components from the original and simply used a difference location and actors. Boy moves to new country. Boy meets girl. Boy gets beat up by locals. Boy gets strange old man with edgy past to teach him how to fight in an impossibly short time etc etc. While Jaden Smith is an improvement to the whining and wimpy Ralph Macchio, clearly showing some of the acting characteristics of his dad, aside from one or two fight scenes one doesn't appreciate Jackie Chan quite as much as his roles in other movies. Not sure I would go as far as to say he was an improvement on the legendary Mr Miyagi.I'm sure the kids will love this one, but if you're older than 14 and missed this in the cinema then don't worry too much about it, it would be good enough to catch it on DVD or TV.",The Karate Kid
422,yashwanth-260990,The original movie is nothing in front of the new movie.,10,11 June 2010,"This is a movie which has some scenes which make us jump from seats. From the starting itself, we normally wait for Jackie Chan to show up, but Jaden Smith proves that he can provide us entertainment to an extent that we even forget Jackie Chan is present in the film. I am not saying that Jaden smith exceeds Jackie Chan, but he is simply superb with his acting skills. Jaden Smith not only is in par with his acting skills, but he has done quite a good job in his fights. The film starts at a normal pace, with good fragments of humor, but in the interval it slightly looses its pace. The director then puts up his skills in the film, as he brings some good fights in the ending. Overall the film is comprised of comedy,action and even some pieces of tragedy. Jackie puts up a good performance as usual. I recommend it is a must watch film for all.",The Karate Kid
423,thenum_13,A great action flick definitely worth the wait!,8,18 June 2010,"I am brand new coming into this series, I don't even know what the first was about, and frankly, I don't care. The performance of Jackie Chan, in a much more dramatic role than I've come to expect from him, truly was phenomenal. His character was anything but fake, and showed the true awkwardness one feels when they have disconnected from the world and reluctantly rejoin. He also amazed me once again with his pure action magic, which I have yet to see surpassed. Jaden also, as in TPoH, is great at acting his age, without it looking like acting. His martial arts also were the most realistic I've seen in quite a long time. I think we will see more amazing films from him in the future, should he choose to go that route. This picture had a surprising amount of dramatic fervor in between the action, and you truly felt the tension between the characters as they tried to live lives that were anything but perfect. Above all, great story, and it is definitely worth the wait! :)",The Karate Kid
424,Watson3957,If only remakes were actually remakes,5,30 June 2010,"I don't normally write reviews (my first actually) but I was taught if you haven't anything good to say then don't say anything. I watch a great deal of movies and enjoy a wide variety, the problem with this film is that I just had to get a few things straight for anyone going to watch it. First off this is not Karate its Kung Fu, this is not the Karate Kid remake but a poor hash on the original, why they had to call it that I do not know, maybe more box office takings or people wouldn't go see a film called The Kung Fu Kid. The original was a coming of age film with the karate being taught with the intention of helping you to understand yourself not to kick the C*** out of somebody. Saying all that the film itself is OK it's not great but it's not rubbish either if you have some time and its not costing you, worth a look but I wouldn't go out of my way to watch it. Jaden Smith is not the best actor in the world, seen worse seen a lot better, assume that daddy helped him acquire the part because he is not the most suitable choice for this role. Chan's not bad but nowhere near the quality he can supply and the rest of the cast has nothing outstanding to offer. The most disappointing thing for me was that I was hoping/expecting better, the opportunity they had for making an excellent remake was wasted and the film cannot be considered a remake and should definitely not be called the Karate Kid.",The Karate Kid
425,vailmusic,Keep This In Mind,8,10 June 2010,"When watching this movie it is crucial to keep in mind that this movie was NOT intended to be a ""remake"" of the original movie. Despite the slight similarities in storyline, there are enough differences to make this Karate Kid it's own movie. Some of the obvious differences are location; age, race and background of the main character; style of martial art taught, etc. This movie, even according to those involved in the making, was meant to be an addition or expansion of the original phenomenon of the first Karate Kid (take Karate Kid 3, for example). Jackie Chan's character in no way shape or form resembles that of Mr. Miyagi any more than Jaden Smith's resembles Daniel. If you spend the entire time viewing this movie comparing and contrasting the original to the current you will be missing out on it's very own story line and only hurting your personal viewing experience. So sit back, relax, and watch Jackie Chan and Will Smith's son do their thing in their own way.",The Karate Kid
426,empy_kalaj,"Emotional, action-packed, and every bit deserving to be added to The Karate Kid franchise",10,11 June 2010,"This movie was incredible. That's pretty much the summary statement right there. It was a great, great movie with real characters, tears, smiles, and overall awesomeness. Jaden Smith is one talented kid, his performance was brilliant and believable --not to mention absolutely adorable. Jackie Chan was Jackie Chan, there is just not much else you can say about him, except -maybe- that he was awesome, too. This movie took me completely by surprise; from reviews I had read, I was not expecting something so complete. No, guys. This is not a remake of the original Karate Kid. Dre is not Daniel, Han is not Miyagi, Kung Fu is not Karate. I know. Yet, it owned itself high up and shined on its own. Quite frankly, this movie deserves (in my opinion) to be put up there with the rest of the Karate Kid's. If there ever was a Karate Kid IV, this was IT.",The Karate Kid
427,wbialas,Poor Remakes,1,12 June 2010,"The original Karate Kid (and its remakes) were classic films, which is why they have stood the test of time. Today's remakes have little to do with the original inspirations behind the films. The original Karate Kid was a ""coming of age movie"", which had Karate as a means to set the characters in motion. The casting was brilliant, Morita was the old, unassuming teacher that imparted more than just how to block with his famous ""wax on-wax off"" lesson. Macchio was the perfect teen counterpart - he was every teen, not one with super human or special effects induced skills. The original focused on development of the movie characters, not the action - and it is the simple basics of Macchio's Karate that made his character work and be strong against the more highly skilled Cobra Kai team.I can buy into the current movie's location in China. With a child as the protagonist it no longer is a coming of age film. And, while Chan is a great action actor, he is not the aged, all knowing teacher like Morita. The current movie focuses on action - to begin cultivating Smith's kid into the next action hero incarnation. This completely misses the point of a remake! Really there is no need to use the Karate Kid title!Lastly, the shift to Chan teaching Smith Kung Fu is just annoyingly inconsistent with the movie title, although that will likely be lost on the masses. Karate is from Japan; Kung Fu is from China. Although they share roots, they are different. I think to have Smith learn ""Karate"" would have been an ingenious story line given the China location, contrasting the martial arts and the cultures and ultimately showing the similar underlying goals of each form. Ah, but that would mean the movie needed more than just action to make it work, something lacking in most scripts today and something the director just does not get.",The Karate Kid
428,supra17,Great Karate Kid Movie that adds and enhances every element,10,12 June 2010,"I recommend this movie most definitely. It was off the hook.It takes Jackie Chan's kung-fu brilliance. It is about time Jackie took on a role of ""Master"" in a film. He has a great student, Jaden to take the role and be the next karate kid.It really took many elements of the old karate kid such as the teacher and student relationship. The jacket on and off versus wax on and off. The mother also played an appropriate role this time around versus the older films the mom was barely noticed. It seemed more realistic. The kung fu was accurate on screen and the demonstration of how good Chinese kung fu really is was realistic.Some areas of comedy was very interesting for example the 'evil' kung fu instructor's demeanor, and photo on the wall wearing sunglasses. Some small details like that add to the films comical effect.Not to forget Jaden's demeanor resembling his father Will smith on several occasions such as when he walked into Jackie's home without requesting permission. Anybody who knows Jackie Chan and Will Smith movies will appreciate the film much more. Knowing the original Karate Kid movie will also appreciate it more. Not to mention anybody who has had real interest and training in Martial Arts as self defense would not only find the film exciting to watch for the action sequences, but also very emotional as Jaden was bullied and attempted to fight back.An overall emotional, thrilling, and happily cheering ending. This film was a knock out. The Beijing setting was appropriate, and very picturesque. I highly recommend anybody who is a fan of Jackie, Will, Jaden, Martial Arts, and Karate Kid to watch this film.Notice how ""jacket on, and jacket off"" translates into combative kung fu. Many subtle details that adds elements after elements of entertainment.3 Thumbs Up",The Karate Kid

He's a very talented, believable child actor- a male Dakota Fanning, and Jackie Chan, of course was perfect. This movie was fun and exciting, and I enjoyed every part of it! It was nice seeing Jackie Chan in a more dramatic role. I really didn't notice how long the movie was. Aside from the stereotypical angry black mother, I couldn't find any clichés.

Hats off to Jaden Smith, he acted too good, what do u expect from an 11 yr kid,thats why we call him KID,not ADULT..... his emotions were natural throughout the movie....and it clearly shows he underwent intense kung fu training, i would say will smith should be really proud of his Lil kid,,soundtrack : NEVER SAY NEVER by j.bieber & j.smith is the highlight of the movie, this song rocks.........and the lyrics is so cheering.to conclude, this movie is money well spent....my rating : 7.8/10 (the story is not so inspiring,thats the only drawback) if we cant find a kung fu trainer so good as Jackie Chan,what can we do...get our ass kicked.....",The Karate Kid
432,vincentrsh,"Entertaining, but brought down by horrible acting.",7,13 June 2010,"Let me start off by first saying that I went into this movie with skepticism. I didn't think that the original movie needed to be remade. While I could go on about the usual spiel about how the movie industry needs new ideas, and going back to do remakes is not the solution... I will refrain from doing so. The reality is, these remakes are happening, whether we like it or not.Having said that, I was amazed by how much potential this movie really has. The re-imagining of the story turned out very well. China's landscape and rich culture has much to lend to a movie like this. The scenery is beautiful. The fighting choreography was superbly entertaining. The soundtrack choices were surprisingly appealing. The cinematography was nothing short of impressively pleasing to the eye.All things considered, its really too bad that the role was given to Jaden Smith. His acting skills are atrocious. While there are glimpses of hope here and there, for the most part he fails to deliver dialog with any oomph. Its all very one dimensional. He may come into his own at a later date... but his age is no excuse for this acting. We've seen children rise to the occasion before (a la Osment). Being a celebrity's son does not automatically qualify you for the big screen; but that's another topic for another discussion on another board on another day.Taraji Henson's acting is inexcusably horrible. Her character is again one dimensional (though this time it seems an understatement to bestow that title upon such an underwhelming on-screen presence).Jackie Chan brings a surprisingly delightful (perhaps because of his minimal dialog) role to life. After hearing the Miyagi role was given to Chan, I told myself there was no way he could pull this off. I was wrong. I admit that. He brings an element of action needed in this case. Chan naturally plays a seasoned veteran of the martial arts and injects life into the run of the mill mentor-teaching-the hero role.At the end of the day, I can't help but say that this is one movie that was entertaining but could have been so much more. With a little more talent this film could have gone down in history as one of the better remakes of our time. However, this is not the case. I'd like to give a movie this uplifting in such tough economic times an 8.5 at least... but the acting here holds this puppy back from being a true bulldog of quality.(This is my first review guys, go easy on me. :P)",The Karate Kid
433,cycoblitz,Kids love this movie. It's about people like them,9,13 June 2010,"The original ""The Karate Kid"" was on TV yesterday so watching it with my 8 year old twin grandsons was entertaining since they both practice the art of karate with passion. From their comments, they got the message, but recognized the out of date music, the ""old movie"" look that kids can see, and the serene dramas from the 80's.Today I wowed them with the remake ""The Karate Kid."" We were all excited about seeing the movie, and we sat there throughout, focused on the the story, the China scenes, and especially the wonderful kung fu techniqes. They loved the movie, the action (8 yr olds) , the fighting, and especially the message of never giving up, no matter what.Seeing the emotions portrayed by Dre, Will Smith's kid: hiding from bullies, getting his butt kicked for no reason, leaving his home, not having a dad, meeting a cute girl, and then finding a friend, a father figure for him was the whole movie. Jackie Chan's kung fu training for a kid who was serious about learning kung fu showed Chan's best role so far.Well, you'll see, unless you have a stigma about ""remake"" or Will Smith's kid, or whatever else you make up to give you a bad experience.I recommend it to people with kids because it's clean, it's exciting, it's about a kid who matures in 2 and a half hours, and they come away feeling good about the movie.""Thanks, Grandma.

And I don't mean critical but flat out miserable individual.This was the BEST REMAKE I'VE EVER SEEN. They did not go over board and they did not misuse the name either by not doing enough.Jackie and Jayden were excellent in this movie along with the other actors. I absolutely LOVED IT. This is a GOOD movie and worth the MONEY. PLUS THE KIDS LOVED IT. Honestly I think people can learn a lot from the movie and it's not one of those movies that look like a video game or the moves look computerized, it looks like Jayden actually learned some martial arts.

435,SooterStars,"A Good Remake, Great for Family.",8,26 July 2010,"I was never a big fan of the original Karate Kid. I became aware of movies after its initial success, and was never one for martial arts films. After becoming involved with someone who practices Kung Fu, however, I started to gain a little interest. Karate Kid was our movie of choice for this weekend, and I must say that I am glad I've learned to enjoy martial arts films.Jaden Smith, contrary to what I have read, is a decent actor. I have seen many Disney ""stars"" with far worse acting abilities hit the big screens recently, and Jaden is gold by comparison. When Dre is angry, he's angry and when his heart is breaking Jaden dives in without holding back. Having several boys at ""Dre's"" age in my family, I must say his performance was very convincing.Little about the movie was hodge-podge, save one thing. It was never made clear how his mother obtained a transfer to China after her employer (a car factory) closed down. I don't doubt the producers felt children wouldn't care, but that question set me on edge until the movie really got going.The portrayal of first love is heartwarming, as is the relationship between Dre and his mother, both of whom are coping with the loss of Dre's father. You learn about this loss a few minutes in to the film, and it adds an element of cohesion later when you learn about Mr.Han's family.My husband, who practices Kung Fu, was impressed by the training methods, as well as the dedication Jaden obviously showed in training for the part. The Jacket-on, Jacket-off exercise not only provided the understanding that respect is key in Kung Fu, but there are several motions in this style of Martial Arts that Dre's exercises prepared him for.I rate this an 8 out of 10 because, while I enjoyed it, the dialogue came out stiff at times and the story line could have been added to, had a few questions been answered.",The Karate Kid
436,fytluv,Excellent!!! why 5.1??,9,15 June 2010,"first of all.. why 5.1/10?? this movie is great the fight scenes choreography are fantastic!! every cast made an excellent effort in acting,.. and also the plot is good.. a young boy move to china with her mother and met a great kung fu master (jackie chan) even though the boy is black (jaden smith) he did a great job in portraying the kid..,, it also has the humor that i love..,, jackie chan did a great job too.,, so far this is the best of chan this 2010..in my opinion,,.. this movie is fantastic,.. although slight different from the 1984 original film.. it still worth watching.. and family will enjoy it!!!",The Karate Kid
437,canidous,deserves more than 5.1,8,15 June 2010,"This film deserves much more than 5.1. It is not just a good entertaining movie but also it makes you think about kung fu discipline and philosophy of peace. I found interesting also how the story is situated in a real life situation of the global economy. Without being the focus of the film, it tells you something about the global economic crisis and jobs outsourced to China. It is not casual that the main characters have to move from Detroit to Beijing. I think it is great the director was able to tell us about Dre Parker's struggles to adapt to that new culture without changing much of the original karate kid version. Of course they don't do karate but I didn't really care about it. Kung fu is more fun and gives room for a more interesting story. I won't tell you more, go see it by yourself.",The Karate Kid
438,LarryBirdsMustache,One of the best and most powerful of all films,10,17 June 2010,"Karate Kid, a sometimes-elliptical masterpiece about the bloody redemption of an alienated kid who does kung fu, has been remade to mark its 26th anniversary. But it hasn't aged so much as triumphantly metastasized. Since the mid-1980s, the movie has become presciently emblematic of our emotionally diseased, violence-prone culture.Central character Dre Parker's semi-psychotic, solo routine in front of the mirror—""You talking' to me?""—has been performed as a gag at keg parties, around lunch tables, in standup routines, via e-mail and certainly in front of mirrors across the world for nearly 20 years.More tragically, John W. Hinckley Jr.'s bizarre infatuation with Jodie Foster—who plays the object of a similar obsession in ""Karate Kid""—caused him to gun down President Reagan in 1981. Hinckley's statement that he wanted to impress the actress, the assassination attempt's bloody denouement (four men were struck down in all) and Hinckley's media infamy echo chillingly the scenario in ""Karate Kid."" Paul Schrader's script, in fact, was partly inspired by the diaries of Arthur Bremer, the man who shot George Wallace.And the movie's theme of bomb-ticking loneliness and, by extension, the notion that we are a nation of angry strangers who vent paranoid resentment toward public figures or the government, couldn't be more resonant today.""Karate Kid"" also happens to be a great movie, one of the few relatively recent films (like ""The Godfather"") to join the pantheon of popular classics and great American cinema.The story is about Vietnam veteran and loner Dre Parker(Jaden Smith), who takes a job as a cabdriver in New York City. He is drawn to—and disgusted by—the 42nd Street and Times Square world of weirdos, hookers and pornographic theaters. Every night, he transports lost souls from place to place in this Hades-like zone, while he fumes with fascination, disgust and unbearable solitude.His frustrated life takes a decisive turn when he meets—and fixes on—two women, two beacons of hope that he steers toward. One is icy uptown girl Betsy (Cybill Shepherd), who works for a presidential candidate, the other is Iris (Foster), a 12-year-old prostitute in bondage to her pimp, Sport (Harvey Keitel). When things don't turn out well with Betsy, Dre takes a course of action that changes everyone's lives forever.",The Karate Kid
439,alexellis2007,the way they mix old with new is beautiful,10,17 June 2010,"Jackie Chan is Mr Hun/hon?, this movies version of Mr. Miyagi i was worried that i would see Mr Chan attempting to be Mr Miyagi, instead, he shows us the deep understanding that Miyagi had. paired with the passion, patience, and skill of the classic martial arts master. the eerie thing is though, that when i see him in this movie, i do not see Jackie Chan, i see Miyagi. not in flesh, or in voice, but in essence. i can see Jackie Chan in this movie playing a younger Miyagi years before the original series. the scene where he destroys the car gave me the impression of a younger Miyagi still learning about life, but still understanding more than most.as for Dre (played by will smith's child) all i can say is wow. this kid can do it all. he can act, dance, fight, and i have never seen a kid his age with the control (both physically, and mentally) that he exhibits in his character.over all i would give this movie 10/10. the perfect meshing of skilled actors, and a real reason for classic karate kid action makes for an instant family classic.",The Karate Kid
440,sander50,an update of an old movie,8,20 June 2010,"The Karate Kid is an update of an old movie. The movie addresses Sherry Parker, a single mother, played by Taraji P. Henson, who is forced to move to China with her 12 year old son, Dre Parker, played by Jaden Smith due to a job situation. While trying to adjust to the new environment, the marital art form of Kung Fu is all around him. Dre is determined to learn the art form and discovers an unusual master, Mr. Han, played by Jackie Chan.The Karate Kid (2010) also mirrors the old famous the classic David versus Goliath scenarios. As Dre Parker tries to meander through the new world that is totally unfamiliar to him, he develops a special interest in an up and coming Chinese violinist, Mei Ying. While they are from different worlds, they find comfort in each other. When a kung fu student and school-house bully, Cheng, discovers the special interest, he makes it nearly impossible for Dre to be comfortable and adjust to the new environment--both in and out of school.Throughout the movie, we visit the journey of Mr. Han training Dre for the final battle. You see all of the different majestic scenery of China—everything from the common market place to the amazing kung fu schools to the Great Wall of China.",The Karate Kid
441,SatiZenBen,I know Kung-Fu!,7,23 June 2010,"I enjoyed it, but I couldn't get The Matrix scene (Neo and Morpheus fighting) out of my mind after watching Karate Kid. I don't know how much time passed from the beginning of the film until the end scenes, but it doesn't seem possible to learn that technique so quickly. ""I know Kung-Fu!"" I was really impressed with the Chinese history and culture incorporated in to the film, though. It was a good film, but the same story as the original. A kid gets picked on. He learns Kung-Fu and fights back. See the movie for yourself and don't just take my words as fact. If you go in expecting choreographed fight scenes, you will miss the main points of the film. Go in expecting nothing and be impressed. Enjoy.",The Karate Kid
442,pokefan568,Great Reboot!,10,23 June 2010,"I loved this movie. But there is some things I did not like about it. Like Dre's Mom. She had horrible acting in this movie. And the fact it was JUST LIKE the original I had thoughts about giving it a ten. I did just for the sheer fact that ""The Karate Kid"" is one of my favorite franchise of all time! I also thought it should have been called ""The Kung Fu Kid"" Because this movie had NOTHING to do with karate except when his mom mentioned and Dre said ""It's not karate, mom"" I loved the movie, but I think that it could have been better. I wonder if it would be considered as a Remake or a Reboot , because it was a lot like the first one. I think the only difference is that the names were changed and not moving to California but moving to China. This Review could be really long but this is all I can say. That was all of my review. I will make another later",The Karate Kid
443,dburnetti,Do yourself a favor - go back and watch the original,3,26 June 2010,"This movie is 40 minutes too long. Lots of scenes of China that seem to have been required by the Chinese authorities in order to allow the crew to shoot the movie on location. It has nearly exactly the same story as the the original - but it is not told anywhere near as well. Jackie Chan has done much better movies. Any Rush Hour Movie is 100 times better,. The theme of this movie seemed to be, ""look at Wil Smith's kid, isn't he cute"". The best part of the movie was Lady Gaga's parody of Weird Al Yankovic's song ""Polka Face"". Do yourself a favor - go back and watch the original. When I see a bad movie, I don't have that much to write about, and it is extremely annoying that I need to come up with ten lines in order to explain to people exactly how AWFUL this movie is. You really ought to change the rules. I would compare this movie to Rhinestone - a movie in which Sylvester Stallone does the singing, and Dolly Parton does the fighting. If you must see it, wait for the DVD or on demand.",The Karate Kid
444,immystic,Amazing movie!,10,27 June 2010,"I agree with one of the reviewers that Jaden is a black therefore is not ""original"" as the original white karate kid.This is an awesome movie, the best action/comedy movie i have seen in years since the departed (action) and blades of glory (commedy). There are only 2 movies EVER that audiences clap at the end that I've seen were ""The Departed"" and ""Karate Kid (2010)"". The story was worth to see, so funny but not cheesy, audiences laugh most of the time from the beginning to the end and they even clap during the movie and of course at the end there was a big applause. some part of the movie is heart-touching. Sceneries in the movies are beautiful. Martial art moves were amazing. Jayden acted so well in this movie despite of the fact he a new kid on the block. It is unjust for the kid to receive an average rating. I would watch this movie again and will definitely add it to my DVD collection when it comes out.",The Karate Kid
445,ar_jufraga965,Huge Fail?,3,1 July 2010,"I truly believe that this movie is a true - fail. As you may have seen, all other movies were with Pat Morita, (a great actor if you ask me) in this one they brought Jackie Chan, come a comedian than an actor, and the biggest and worst mistake that can be done in a movie, CHANGING THE RACE OF THE MAIN CHARACTER!!! First, this can cause confusion for people that haven't seen the other ones or people that have that ""way of thinking"" that they believe that the new stuff is always better, it's really unprobable but it happens. Another thing I realized about this movie is that the name is ""The Karate Kid"" and the movie is about a kid who learns Kung Fu, not Karate Do. C'mon , son, be serious.",The Karate Kid
446,dorthensensens,A pale comparison to the Original.,5,2 July 2010,"Despite having good acting performances from Jackie Chan and Jaden Smith, the screenplay destroyed the actors' ability to give the audience a meaningful connection with the characters. The original Karate Kid had an ability to tell a dramatic story that gave great impact to that film. So much so that the ""Karate"" was incidental to the film. Not so in this modern incarnation. Case in point:The final ""jump kick"" performed seemed to have come out of nowhere and lacked any impact as to how he learned it, why he did it, how difficult was it for him to learn etc...where as in the original, all of these elements were craftily placed in the story line giving the Daniel Larusso's final jump kick a powerful climax to the film. This film should have been its own film with less hearkening with verbatim lines from the original. They should have called it the Kung Fu Kid and created a better story (or perhaps just have better story tellers) that made it's own memes.",The Karate Kid
447,carlodechiro,Oh dear !,3,6 July 2010,"Well as you can see from the summary title after watching this remake my feelings were oh dear. How can they make such a good film as the original into this mediocre shadow of itself. To confirm my fears and not just to see if my rosy coloured 80's spectacles were clouding my view, I very soon afterwards got my ""karate kid"" DVD box set and had a nostalgic time watching the first one again.My fears were soon confirmed, not that this film if it was standalone has no merits, but rather that many watching it may never know how superior the original is. The character development and choice in this remake is poor, highlighted especially in their ages. It is simply not believable that children this young would or should be having some kind of heavy romantic life episode. The story is never developed like in the original, the characters seem disjointed and vital pieces of the story seem to be missing.Why is the new kid being beaten up, is it because he is American, Black, a foreigner or was there a romantic link between the main bully and the newcomers love interest, none of which is explored fully or explained. Some of the dialogue lacks the quality or depth of the original, when asked about his black eye he says ""I walked into a post"" upon which Mr Han replies ""interesting post"", in the original the reply by Mr Miyagi ""lucky no hurt hand"" is far more witty deep and intelligent. The cobra kai club is also woefully understated, and the maniacal instructor a mere walk on part. Which is symptomatic of the poorer plot development leading to the big Han/Miyagi karate student fight.Overall if you liked the original, even loved it, then only watch it if you have nothing better to do and I mean nothing. The only thing I hope is that all the newbies to the story will have a desire to watch the original but maybe that is wishful thinking !!!",The Karate Kid
448,jsantiago4421,Waste of your time and money film,2,9 July 2010,"OK so I'll give the movie some credit for trying to be a coming of age type story. If you can sit through the first half hour plus of Jaden Smith being a complete brat to everyone (especially his mother who just lays down and takes it), then maybe you get to Jackie Chan's short (and only) real fight scene, and Jaden learning some Kung Fu.I grew up a Will Smith fan and the Fresh Prince and some of his early movies were good. But seriously Will does whatever he wants now, which is mostly complete garbage (can you say Hancock???). I respect what he does, but seriously him shamelessly buying his son into a movie is ridiculous. Maybe in 10years Jaden will have some actual acting skills, but for now this movie has been hyped up way too much and is way too crappy to be worth anyones time. I respect the effort Jaden put in to training for the Kung Fu in the movie, but maybe he should have spent a lot more time actually practicing acting. His acting is not good and he spends the movie trying to be a bad ass. A couple more beatings from the other kids in this movie and you think he'd be humble instead of thinking he was the toughest guy out there. The acting is pretty bad, and anyone who thinks the acting and script are good are idiots and probably blame it on a language barrier for the supporting cast. Will should've produced this entire movie in Mandarin and slapped subtitles on it so then its just a crap version of a Kung Fu movie and we don't notice the terrible acting that accentuates a bad script.The only redeeming quality of this movie is Jackie Chan, and he isn't at his comedic best (because lets face it, we all love Jackie because he's funny). But if you like Jackie beating up a group of kids, then fast forward to almost the 40th minute, watch about 2 minutes of the movie and that's all you need to see. Then you can come and write a review saying how amazing the movie is and be ignorant to the fact that rest of the movie sucks.",The Karate Kid

That didn't happen. Literally the only thing good about this movies, is it reminded me that I have to run the Great Wall marathon in the Tianjin Province before I turn 40.",The Karate Kid
450,thewlisp-794-375547,"Be mindful of the PR reviews, including on this site",5,18 July 2010,"I don't envy writer Christopher Murphey's task in this reinvention of the original 1984 underdog tale. Firstly, the second time scribe is dealing with source material which was dull at best, but strangely transcended that to become an absolute cult classic for all children of the 80s. This was in part down to Joe Esposito's 'You're the best around' inspired soundtrack mixed with an innocent fighting spirit which beat much of societies ills to the black belted punch - questions such as why is this old man taking such special interest in the Ralph Macchio character? Will all these kids become obese when they invent video games?Karate as I remember it involved the fairly peculiar kids at school wearing white terry towelling suits under normal anoraks while standing at bus stops rather too late at night. Clearly Hollywood remembers something far different as we find Dre Parker (Jaden Smith) high kicking high above the Chinese landscape atop the Great Walls highest turret with Jackie Chan's Mr Han watching attentively. Yes, the reimagining takes the action to Beijing where Dre's somewhat distant widower Mother has relocated their family to teach English. Her small part is all too evident as a bit part, under considered and stilted to Smith's Dre and almost entirely inconsiderate and sometimes rude. While the Chinese backdrop plays up the traditions and values of karate (almost entirely referenced as Kung Fu, which I believe to be different) it is repeatedly demonised by Americanisms whether that be the basketball court hustle Dre encounters on his arrival or the bonkers set piece where Dre's mother walks through a slummy shopping Market carrying a Bloomingdales style bag - give the girl a Starbucks latte in a takeout cup. Hollywood interpretations aside, Karate Kid struggles with an average performance from debut lead Smith whose dialogue and regards to his largely Chinese co-cast are on the same time time delay that his character complains of early in the movie. Chan of course is his brilliant sole- choreographed self but even after so much time, is sometimes barely understandable yet the subtitles ignore him completely. When he's riffing with Dre's Detroit Street, it makes the entire film impossible to follow were it not for a plot lifted directly from the original. Sure, wax on, wax off is now pick up coat, hang up coat and the action labours toward the tournament fight at the end which disappointingly relies on CGI and wire stunts unlike the early training sequences and conflict fights that are sparky and original - one of the only elements of this film that is. Knowing the plot, you'd think the script would rattle through at a 90 minute pace but instead labours to 2 hours where the first plot point - arrival in China - comes little more than 8 minutes in, but we wait 40 minutes before Chan agrees to train his protégé and beyond an hour before the classic training montage begins, demanded by a genre which just doesn't appear to allow snake training temples and Chinese festivals in some of the movies dullest moments. I can't see kids enjoying this now in a world where it would be Tekken over training any day and it's just not kitsch or fun enough for their parents wanting a throwback experience with the kids. The pluses are definitely Chan and some elements of the fight production; far outweighed by a non-existent soundtrack, average acting, drawn out and unnecessary plotting plus dialogue which barely works said in English and translates even worse when presented on screen in subtitles - an interesting consideration and challenge for screenwriters and filmmakers everywhere - but one in which Murphey fails.Of course this isn't all his problem but I wouldn't expect a sequel to be optioned anytime soon and we can be thankful of that.",The Karate Kid

Many people that are saying it was rubbish are probably the people that were able to see the original, but it's not really about what they think as this is more a kid's film, but nonetheless Jaden Smith was very well cast and both he and Jackie Chan did a fantastic job.Remakes or updates shouldn't be compared to the fantastic originals, they should both be enjoyed as separate films with both positives and negatives.",The Karate Kid
452,masterblaster500,Exactly the same.....,2,29 July 2010,"This movie is an almost exact (approx. 90%) copy of the first karate kid.While I was watching the movie I knew exactly what was going to come. The movie title is ""The Karate Kid"" while ""Dre"" learns Kung-Fu, now this a bit weird as I couldn't find any reference to karate. Now the actor JadennSmith was terrible, he only got the role because his father is a big actor, which disappoints me as the movie could have been much better with an older actor (like Daniel from the original). The story, as I already told, was 90% the same as the original. The jacket-off/on technique didn't make sense as he did different motions then what he learned when ""Mr.Han"" started to ""attack"" him, also suddenly he became one of the best fighters in a couple of days. Dre had no needs to complain, when Daniel did the motions it actually seemed he was doing labor for Mr.Miyagi, Mr.Han had nothing to gain when Dre did this thus making it clear logic. The love in the story is bad, they are only like 10 years old. There are much more bad things in the movie, but I want to talk about the last fighting scenes. These scenes are while the competition is going on. All these flying kicks look fatal, but also these are not part of Kung Fu. Then in the last fight, the final where Dre is injured badly, Dre gets an awful kick to the face while replying ""Im OK"". Then he stood back up and as last did this Kung-Fu technique he learned in the mountains from a woman controlling a snake. When he did this his opponent turned his head when Dre did this, reflecting the snake, but a man is not a snake. As last the winning backflip kick was worthless, you could clearly see it didn't even hit him and the opponent was standing way too far away.Nonetheless a good movie... not, it is totally the same as the first movie and they could have made the movie much better, but with a different story line and another actor instead of Jaden Smith. The 2 out of 10 is because I liked the story of the old movie, but not a repetition.",The Karate Kid
453,greg-j-mchugh,Enjoyable even if a little predictable,8,7 August 2010,"While the plot of this movie is a bit predictable I enjoyed it. I have spent time in Beijing and another Chinese city. I think the film authentically captured many aspects of domestic life in China. Chan does a magnificent job and carefully conceals the comedic elements of his personality. The classic temple, great wall, forbidden palace scenes are genuine. Of course the rail third class carriage scenes have less passengers than I have ever experienced in that class. It is usually standing room only. The only thing I would have changed was some elements of the fight scenes but I think this may have impacted on the classification of the movie and therefore its target audience. A reasonable first effort for young Smith.",The Karate Kid

I won't get into details of how good or bad it is in order to try and manipulate you like most do, all I'll say is go see it for yourself.. There was a thing that bothered me really and that was : The similarities to Undisputed III and stunts/moves that belong and have been seen by Scott Adkins in most of his movies and NOT JC..

455,graeme-kissock,A very below average movie (Review may contain spoilers!!!!!),1,21 August 2010,"Perhaps it is a strong sense of nostalgia that invokes a real sense of happiness when i hear the name ""The Karate Kid"", it is a film from my youth that i will cherish fond memories of forever. However after sitting through the abomination that is the 2010 version of this movie i am extremely irked. The film that taught so many of us about a culture and martial art that was relatively unknown at the time has been sullied and urinated on from a great height.To call a film the ""Karate"" kid, when it has absolutely nothing to do about karate is just, in my opinion, a vein attempt to invoke a connection to the original. The film, now set in China (yes, the original was set in America but the premise was an elderly Japanese man teaching a youth about his culture, martial art and becoming the father figure he needed), and focusing on the martial art of Kung Fu, is so far removed from the original they may have well just given it a new name and made it into a new film, although i suppose ""The Kung Fu Kid"" doesn't have quite the same ring to it.The film is 2 hours and 20 minutes of feeling a little ashamed at yourself for wishing harm to children, which is pretty much all it is for that ridiculously long run time, kids beating up kids. It takes all of about 15 minutes before Jaden Smith gets his arse handed to him by a Chinese kid, but of course Chinese kids beating up an African-American child is so much more P.C than white kids picking on a white kid, right? Oh and we do get the rip off of it being a Kung Fu tourament now, wouldn't want to make it a original at all would we America? They didn't even attempt to make this its own movie other than changing the scenery and lowering the age limit for getting a whoopin', it even starts the same, Mom gets a transfer so our young protagonist must uproot himself and move to a new city and make new friends and find his new love interest, even though the kids are far too young for love interests we are given the sickeningly sweet moment where young Jaden Smith gets his first kiss, aww... yuck! The ONLY saving grace to this movie is Jackie Chan, who, although does not give off his usual performance, still gives off his usual charm that we all know and love... but unless you are a DIE HARD Jackie Chan fan, just avoid this movie. Forget it exists, because i wish i could erase the last two and a half hours of my life. My Vote, this gets a below average score of 3/10. The film actually could have been good if they did things a little different. I know they wanted to make it its own movie, which is why it is so far removed from its far superior original, But in doing so they have just made it even more obvious that it is something it will never be... A time tested classic gem from our generation.Do yourself a favor, go out, buy yourself the re-released digitally remastered box set, get some popcorn on the go and have yourself a good old fashioned good night in with one of the greatest movies of my generation.",The Karate Kid

I enjoyed the originals (when I was young) and I like Jackie Chan, but it just smacked too much of one long promo for Jaden Smith, who I also think is too young for the part and just too annoying. JC gave a good , if refrained, performance and gave glimpses of his old self. Also I think an ex-pat in China would normally have a much better package that would include a nice apartment and good international school, so not very realistic - perhaps they should have kept the story in US. However, JC's lesson about Kung Fu being a part all aspects of life, not just a fighting tool, was excellent and a real lesson for us all.So I overall I would have given the film 6 out of 10 (for JC) but JS cost it -4.

The story was sad, and a thriller all wrapped into one. Jaden did such a good job being hurt and the little guy who was hurting him did a great job too. The children themselves are great with the animosity. Jaden having to move to a different country was different, but you had to love his mother and when she would get so mad over him hanging up his coat. I saw the original karate kid and liked this one just as much. My children watched it twice and loved it. My husband and I both enjoyed it too. A nice family movie and very well done.",The Karate Kid
462,Fajsha,Entertaining,7,31 October 2010,"I found The Karate Kid 2010 pretty entertaining. Though like most of you expected this movie is pretty predictable, but if you can look beyond that its a overall entertaining. Compliments on Jaden Smith, he's done a good job portraying his character and so did Jackie Chan, he plays a totally different character then were used to and it worked out pretty goodI can understand that the older generation is gonna compare the original karate kid with the 2010 karate kid but i suggest, try to look at it as a new karate kid, it's not a copy. Some parts you'll remember but overall its completely different I feel that it'll take away some of the entertaining value if you compare every scene like some people tend to do A solid 7 because it kept me interested and i felt the vibe",The Karate Kid

Everything was super obvious; it's like they made the movie for a moron to watch. They really underestimated their audience. Jaden Smith is terrible! I was really hoping for so much more. I didn't realize that Ralph Macchio was as good as he was until I saw Jaden try to force his way through this script. Even Chan looked like he was sleeping through the film. I guess we can't blame him. They must have paid him handsomely to put his name on this dog. The mother character is just odd. I really encourage you to spend your money on something else!

464,alschu234,Let's settle the doubts on the Karate Kid,10,1 November 2010,"Let me just say that the title Kung Fu Kid doesn't flow like the Karate Kid does in no way. Even if he is learning Kung Fu, it doesn't matter.Another topic about the bullies(Cheng and friends) don't even taunt him about being a karate kid. If you see the international trailer on YouTube then you will hear them say exactly that(the taunt) in the first fighting scene. It sounds weird and out of place, so the directors and producers must have cut the sound and clip out of the film because it didn't fit. Dre over reacting is another thing. I don't see any problem with his acting skill all around.In the scene where Dre is trying to learn Karate, he seems not in to it, not over reacting. He over reacts when his mom tells him to pick up his jacket if that's what people are mentioning.Overall this movie was a creative, non stop action film. It is my favorite movie and I love it! Jaden was a perfect kid for the job, and I'm sure this will score him some more major motion picture movies. Thank you Will and all the cast and directors for a more interesting better version of the Karate Kid.""Remember...always strong"".Jackie Chan was the perfect man for the role as Mr Han.",The Karate Kid

If you don't want to ruin all the good memories with the conversations of Mr. Miyagi and Daniel-San and the chemistry between them, do not watch it! What the hell is wrong with you people? Who let this to be produced at all? And a sequel is coming? Really guys, what's wrong with you??? Even the lowest rated of the ""Karate kid"" parts is better than this one. If you are willing to do a remake, do it the same way - no Chinese stuff, no ""put it down, put it up"", no car accidents, no ""Shao-Dre"" (wtf!??!), no stupid conversations. I'll suggest you, instead of watching this, give the money to buy the original. Watch it first. Than if like it, do not watch the remake. If you don't then watch it. I'm sure this movie is ""the best movie ever"" for like 10-13 years old boys, but only if they had the chance to watch the original first, I'm sure they'll have the same opinion as mine.

467,realtimer,Expected Greater Things from Will Smith,5,28 November 2010,"The movie stars Jaden Smith, Will Smith's son, as the star actor, a movie with Will Smith as the producer. It is a remake of the former Karate Kid movie with just enough variation from the former to make it somewhat interesting.First, the movie had too many scenes that were mundane, and you have to wonder whether the cutting room was on a lunch break.I really wanted to believe in Jaden Smith, but his performance was like a crooked Mona Lisa. In other words, although the picture is beautiful, there just seemed to be something a little off about it. There were scenes where Jaden did very well, but there were other scenes where it was apparent why fathers should never produce films where their child is the star. If it had been any other child, I am certain Will Smith would have pushed the child harder in order to achieve greatness. It is apparent that Jaden has potential, but the father is not the one who can bring out those qualities. In this movie, Jaden Smith just appears as a child of privilege who is only pretending to be a poor kid. The camera scenes were reminiscent of a home movie that a father makes of a child, where the love and adoration for the child clearly comes across in the film.The mother is a great actress but not for this movie. Some reviewers remarked they found the mother to be annoying. That is an accurate assessment.There is a blond headed boy that greets the Dre character upon arrival to China, but the boy's role serves as a dangling modifier. Bordering on being a dangling modifier is the budding love relationship between Jaden and the young Chinese girl. Whatever goal Will Smith intended to reach was not reached.The bully is the most consistently believable part of the film.All in all, the movie is cute but not memorable.",The Karate Kid

The characters were developed well enough to make me feel for them throughout the entire movie. I felt that the lessons taught in this movie were good ones that all children need to learn, especially today. Well done! You can't compare it to the first Karate Kid movie. It wasn't trying to be that movie; it wasn't even the same type of martial arts! Watch it as its own thing, don't expect Pat Morita out of Jackie Chan.

470,illrichflips,Terrible...,1,25 November 2011,"The word awful is an understatement. Abysmal is much more suited for the title in question. This is my first review. I don't normally write reviews because I feel that my number accurately represents a film. Yet this film is below a one, thus I must express my feelings with this review since the scale is broken. Immediately my intelligence is insulted by the title alone, ""The Karate Kid"" implies the Japanese martial art of karate, not the Chinese art of Kung-fu. To assume the audience would not know the difference insults entire cultures, not just Chinese, Japanese, but even American and other cultures in the the sense that all Asians are the same... The acting is poor at best, accept for Chan Kong-sang (Jackie Chan), who is almost always endearing despite the lack of characterization in his role. Yet this might be his worst performance. Jaden Smith is quite possible the worst child actor i have ever seen in my life. Just because your father is Will Smith should not qualify you to have a lead role in a poor remake. I have seen more emotion from a cucumber before i slice it and put it in a salad. ""This is the best water i ever tasted"" for a child who is dehydrated after a several mile trip up a mountain, you would think he would have facial expression, gratitude and exuberance in his voice. This child had the same expression on his face the entire movie, and constant lack of emotion in his voice. Noriyuki (Pat) Morita is rolling over in his grave with this war crime of a movie. Ralph Macchio is by no means known for his acting ability, but Jaden Smith makes him look like Leo Dicaprio. Hollywood has put out tons of remakes lately, none which have been very good but this has to be the worst of them all. I hope for all humanity's sake Jaden Smith is never cast in any movies, television, or even radio. I saw this movie three time (not in theaters, thank god) just to make sure i was not wrong in my opinion. As a teacher i do not advocate hitting children, but someone needs to slap this kid and maybe that will force him to show any kind of emotion. The best part of the movie was getting to hear the Gorillaz Dirty Harry (Schtung Chinese New Year Remix) for all of about 40 seconds.Do not see this movie! You will thanks me. All copies should be burned along with the negatives to save anyone who has not seen this film, and the people who have!!!Sincerely disenchanted and offended,-Richard Ross Ramirez",The Karate Kid
471,candeehiker,A crying shame of a remake,1,18 April 2011,Director must have hated karate kid to the point he wanted to make a mockery out of it. Mean looking African American kid (certainly not the underdog like the last); I mean the kids that act like bullies are suppose to be the bad losers. Lets not forget that Jackie Chan's worthless acting replaced Mr Matti. Fight scenes were sparse and training was more of a filler. Same old plot with no intelligent creativity found. There was also no talent present anywhere outside of extras. Im half surprised the director didn't resort to slow motion matrix style fighting. This movie is so deplorable i will avoid any future movies with these main two actors and its director/producer.,The Karate Kid
472,A-G-P-Goodman,Stunning,10,24 April 2011,"I saw this film in August 2010 last year after waiting about a year or so since I first heard that they were going to do a remake of the classic 80's film.Loving the original three, I was highly eager to see this re-imagining. It was the most entertaining film I've ever seen at the cinema. I was practically left speechless leaving the cinema. A perfect film.This movie, more so than any many movies recently, has had mixed opinions. The film is literally awesome in every way possible. Just because it features kung-fu as opposed to karate does not matter as the title 'The Karate Kid' is a classic, well remembered one and why change it to 'The Kung-fu Kid just for the sake of it featuring kung-fu. The title 'The Karate Kid' is both recognition and iconic and changing it would differ from the heart of the title and it's iconic bearings. Whilst the film is not a direct remake in the sense of its characters having the same names as in the original i.e. Daniel and Mr. Miyagi as well as the same locations, it is an absolutely stunning re-imagining type remake of the iconic and classic 80's film. The film utilises the same themes, ideas, concepts and morals as the original but also adds its own and enhances them by upgrading them incredibly well across the board. The casting was absolutely perfect. Smith certainly has a very promising future ahead of him. He made the role his own and have an absolutely amazing performance throughout the whole film. His character Dre may have been younger than Machio's Daniel but it didn't matter nor did it matter to the other characters and central bully Cheng who was perfectly cast and delivered a stunning performance both physically and emotionally. Jackie Chan as Mr. Han, the Mr. Miyagi character was an absolutely perfect choice. Not only did he deliver stunning physical performances but emotionally, he put his heart and sole into making the character strong, extremely interesting, dynamic and dimensional. The other characters were also excellently cast. The chemistry between Han and Dre and everyone else was brilliantly illustrated with an immensely powerful bond clearly shown between them all. The romance was more playful and innocent. All the themes and morals in the film were thoroughly developed and extremely well presented. Chan acted superbly in every scene and made his role like every else did; believable and highly entertaining to watch. The ending was perfect and very satisfying with Horner's powerful score giving the whole film an immense pleasure and richness and texture which really gave the whole movie a huge amount of substance. The cinematography was stunning throughout; exquisite shots of both China and the central story action enhanced with some superb colour grading and tones. The editing was fresh, original and highly well informed.Every character and scene were thoroughly developed and given appropriate amounts of screen time. What I loved however was the perfect balance between it all; the story, the emotion, the action...Overall it sounded like the filmmaker's were very confident in their vision and approach. The movie clearly stands on it's own two feet, hold it's own against the original and stays highly loyal. It had everything in it, including comedy, suspense and tension. It was pure in its approach and highly entertaining. It was different to your average movie and was uplifting all of the time. I personally do think that one should compare this re-imagining to the original in a certain, particular sense. The original will always have a place in peoples hearts and will always have a passion to those who love them. This remake does not attempt to replace the original nor does it attempt to steal the values from it. Instead it brings the story alive in a brand new light. Morita and Macchio as Miyagi and Daniel will be forever irreplaceable but the remake respects this whilst at the same time teaches us the same morals and values. In many ways, these different interpretations of a timeless, classic, coming of age type story teach lessons in life. 'Life will knock us down, but we can choose man or not to get back up' spoken by Chan's character Han, based on many morals from the original and in life speaks a thousand words alone capture some of the greatest lessons in life, yet at the same time in the fictional sense of the story reminds us of our inner struggles, beliefs and desires. The tournament scene was stunning in every way but what was beautiful, was that unlike the original where Johnny Lawrence hands Daniel the trophy, this film went one step further and had both Cheng and all of Master Li's student bow and acknowledge Han and Dre as a sign of redemption and respect after Cheng personally handed Dre the trophy again, as a sign of redemption. This was beautifully illustrated. Although the alternate ending where Han fights Li was cut for obvious reasons as at this point in the film it's of no relevance to the story, it was fantastically choreographed and created. It would be a perfect way to open film two much like with Miyagi defeating Kreese at the start of the original karate kid sequel. Film two is proposed for release in 2013. In another superb scene, Han reveals to Dre his tragic past (a mirror reflection of the original's same scene where Miyagi reveals his loss to Daniel). Chan literally put 110% and more into this scene and Smith superbly maintained his character performance within such a difficult scene. The sequence which followed where they train with the sticks in silhouette in front of the car headlights was perfect ad was the turning point where they cement each other's true trust and heal each others wounds.Stunning; brilliant approach to innovative filmmaking. 10/10.",The Karate Kid
473,kevin-wing-89-824990,It was never going to be a patch on the original,4,24 June 2011,"Sequel's are seldom going to be a patch on the original and this is no exception. The story and characters have changed considerably but that said this is not a bad film in its own right. It is relatively well acted by the young Jaden Smith and we always know what to expect from Jackie Chan. I suppose because it is a remake you always want to compare it to the original and this is where it fails. The connection between master and student is weak and the overall dialogue is poor. It does not give you the same sense of connection, where as all the characters in the original film are solid and believable. The fight scenes are very good and the moves and style improved, but while this is something good to watch it doesn't have the same passion and grit as the original. I did notice that the cast is younger so the film is probably aimed at a younger audience which probably means people watching have not even seen the original - which is probably for the best. In summary, not a bad film for the younger generation, but as far as story, characters and overall excitement its quite a disappointment compared to the original.",The Karate Kid
474,sigermen,"The first movie was good, the new one is better",7,10 January 2013,"When i was a little kid i watched the original Karate Kid movie and i was exited about the movie. It was brilliant the story, the martial art and Mr Miyagi was just perfect for the role as a karate teacher. I also liked the main character Ralph Macchio as Daniel and Pat Morita as Mr. Miyagi. He was really legendary when i saw him the first time in the movie. But then i saw the new one and i must say that the new one is pretty good compared to the old one. Why? So let's see. The story begins in Detroit showing Dre Parker with his mother moving from US to China. So here is the first point i like in the movie. They move to China, the homeland of many martial arts and a completely new culture. In the original movie Daniel and his mother just move from New Jersey to California. So it doesn't change much. The people in California are actually the same. But in the new movie the main character comes into a new world. So the location for the movie was perfect. And China has a wonderful landscape and a lot of attractions. Simple the new movie offers a much more beautiful scenery than the old one. After Dre and his mother arrived in China, the first conflict occurs on the playground outside between Dre and a couple of Chinese kids. Dre has no idea what he did wrong and he doesn't understands their language. And there we got the second point for the new movie. The fighting scenes are much better and exiting than in the old one. Of course there were other times and other environment in the old movie. Also the new one has more emotions. For example the scene where Han is sitting in his car and talking about the accident.It's also interesting how few people talk about music in films. Every movie would be a flop without the background musics. In this movie the writer of the music was James Horner (the maker of the Titanic soundtrack which got an Oscar and several wins). I don't understand how some people don't like the soundtrack in the Karate Kid movie but in my opinion the soundtrack was brilliant. For example the part where Han is training Dre on the Chinese wall or the final battle and the ending. Well done James Horner!So overall I would say that the new Karate Kid is a pretty good remake. It has better locations, beautiful scenery, action scenes and emotions. But this is only objectively. It's like comparing an old classic Lamborghini and a new one. The new one is just better but the old remains classic. So the new movie was made for the new generation and i doubt that young kids will go watch the old Karate Kid movies. So I think this movie deserves a better note than 6,7. Objectively I would give this good remake a 7/10. Subjectively I would give a 9/10. But still the old one remains legendary with Mr. Miyagi and his ""Wax on, wax off.""",The Karate Kid

476,duelist54,Remake Still Good,8,17 October 2012,"If you liked the 1985 version of the ""Karate Kid"", then you would also like its 2010 remake. In this film, Dre Parker (Jaden Smith) and his mother move to China due to a job. Almost immediately, Dre hates his new home and is also having trouble fitting in. Soon, he meets a girl who he takes a liking to. From there, it was not long before Dre would get himself into a fight with some of the local boys before he is save by the maintenance man, Mr. Han (Jackie Chan). Mr. Han would then teach the boy martial arts in order for the boy to fight back against his attackers in a tournament.The message I got from watching the film is to never give up when life looks bad. This is portrayed rather bluntly as Dre and Mr. Han overcome struggles throughout the film, Dre fighting his fears and Mr. Han learning to move on from his past. Ever since Dre was attacked by the local boys, he grew afraid of facing them in the tournament and pushed himself until the very end to confront them. As for Mr. Han, he was depressed over losing his family and constantly tried to figure out whether or not he had forgotten something important. He made the message clear by telling Dre what he learned from him.What surprised me about this film is Jackie Chan's role as Mr. Han. In this film, he doesn't play a comical or cheerful character like he usually does, but instead he is displayed as more of a gloomy character. Despite that, he does have a few minor comical moments that would bring out at least a grin. I was impressed by the action and fighting scenes that occurred in the film. In comparison to the original film, the fighting was more dynamic and fast paced. That led me to find it more appealing than the original. Overall, the climax of the film was extremely well done and made it worth watching.",The Karate Kid

A story really close to reality. Full Credits to Jackie Chan & Jaden Smith for their mesmerizing Acting. This film takes what was done in the original film and has nicely upgraded across the board. The romance is more playful and innocent, with the friendship aspect ultimately being the plot focus. The student/teacher dynamic has an even stronger father/son underlying tone and finally, the action is much much improved upon.All of the above is due to excellent performances across the board. Jaden Smith shows to be a more than capable actor in the making and with no doubt observation of Chan, who we FINALLY get to see in a dramatic role rather than action/comedy role. Smith and Chan have a fun chemistry that helps make the film enjoyable. The movie is really well directed. This Movie is one of its kind. I Recommend every one should watch this movie.

478,grivessillus,Absolutely Awful. Should Be called The Kung Fu Kid.,1,1 May 2013,"This film is awful. Not saying the original was so great. But it made more sense than this.It's disjointed, and illogical.The scenes have little to no explanation to them. There's set pieces, but little to no explanation as to how they got there.The bullies come out of nowhere. Were the original, it was jocks, and eyes off the girl I like. It made sense.This, it's literallyDre Hi Meiying HiBullies from nowhere Why ar'nt you practicing. Stop talking to her. Let's fight!That's it. No other reason.The mother is completely out of place. She's like something from a 'loud women movie'. She's a 'loud black woman', cliché. It's like they forced her to tone it down, before she started saying, trash like 'you go girl'. She does'nt act like a mother at all. She's aggressive and combative to her own son. Completely oblivious to his problems. If he really walked into a lamppost, he would'nt be wearing your makeup, you stupid woman! She veers between disrespectful to her own child, aggressive to him, and over fussy and forgetful of reading school rules. She fails to notice he's unhappy. Completely fails to notice he hates china. Right up to the point he says it, after she walks through a slum market with him, waffling on about ice-cream. She tells him to go up to complete strangers, to test Chinese, at one point. That's downright dangerous.It never says what her job is. That's a mercy, in a way, since she is so appalling, that you would'nt want more screen time with her. But they could have at least said what she did. It's obviously something high ranking, or they would'nt have moved to to china.The mother in the original, acts like a mother, and they say what she does.His name is downright stupid. Dre is not a full name. It's not even short for dreydan, or something. Dr Dre is a stage name, he is'nt really called Dre. And it's not like someone of his parents class would call their child after a rapper. She's at least management. And his father was a policeman.The name Dre is for no other reason than to make it sound pseudo Chinese when Han starts calling him Xauio Dre. Instead of it being Xauio Tyrese, or Xauio William.She hands him over to Han, despite knowing him for like 5 minutes. Mr Miyagi, the mother knows him for a while.Also, Mr Han is nowhere near as good as Mr Miyagi. Miyagi never had a freaking mental breakdown and tried to gas himself with his car. Han does. Miyagi was always very together. Han is not. The last thing a film like this needs is a teacher who's having mental issues.And no, you would not learn kung fu from messing about with a jacket. That's just stupid. Waxing a car to learn karate is also stupid.He fails to teach him how to face a opponent. The first thing you'd learn , how to face a opponent. The boy panics the first time he is in a real fight. He does far too little real fight training.And how he get's into the fight, downright stupid.Also, if it's not karate they're doing, then don't call it the karate kid. Call it the kung fu kid.Also, the boys way too outgoing and confident to be bullied. The original, Daniel was quiet enough to reasonably be the target of jocks. But a boy like this one, not going to be bullied. He'd be straight in with the popular kids.Also, 12 is far too young. 13, 14, like the original, fine. It's old enough to do the darker things. But a 12 year, far too young.The evil kung fu school. Honestly, they would'nt have to fight. They're so corrupt, they would get disqualified entirely.And, surely, if a kung fu schools that bad, they could report them to a ombudsman or something?What they do is downright weird.The girl has stupid hair.

479,henrikslarsen,Pleasantly surprised...,7,21 June 2010,"I am not saying the original Karate Kid movie was a revolution in movie-making. It was good fun, and a good feel-good movie for my generation. Wax on, wax off was the mantra of weirdos with a thing for theatrics for years. I am saying, I am not the ""oh the original was sooo fantastic, don't ever touch it"" kind of guy.Nonetheless, the whole remake scene has bothered me for some time (not an original opinion, either), so it was with some serious hesitation that I even cared to watch this one. But midways through, I found myself enjoying it. Like the original, not a revolution in modern cinema, but a pretty good feel-good movie, and a good movie experience. Smith Jr. does it well (again, not Oscar material, but that is not what anyone should expect from it, IMHO), and I was very happy to see Chan do a good role, I have a deep love for his movies. Miyagi/Han is an appealing character, with a good movie-type philosophy. And the Kung Fu (thank GOD they didn't call it karate in the movie!!!) was compelling, even if a bit clichéd. And many of the old concepts are honored without copying (the new version of wax on, wax off was excellent).Three things that make this a 7 and not an 8 are that they did not make the opposing characters very deep (I remember hating the bad guys in the original), the movie title should NEVER be Karate Kid (what the hell is wrong with ""Kung Fu Kid""?? It's a great title, an homage and yet fully its own!) and (SPOILER, READ BACKWARDS!!)gniniart eht ni ton saw kcik gninniw eht(/SPOILER).

The name of the movie: it's about kungfu, not karate. More specific, karate is a type of martial art of Japan, not China. What the main character and other kids learned and showed was kungfu, not Karate. 2. The film indicated how ambitious and energetic the main character is. Great. Except for some small problems : the main character didn't show any things proving that he was learning kungfu. The way he punched, kicked,... every move he did is completely failed.

481,teddyunderhill,Very Very Poor Execution of the Exact Script of the Original,1,1 January 2011,"This film is a perfect example of how difficult it is to actually make a good film. Even using a proved script and story that led to a monumental film in 1984 couldn't save this reboot. It is simply awful in every way. Poor acting, poor cinematography, poor directing, poor editing, poor poor poor. The best scenes from the original are inexplicably absent. In the original, Daniel spends half the film working on Mr. Miyagi's house. He is forced to do the work because he made the promise of ""i karate teach and you karate learn"". In this film, Dre hangs up a jacket ""a thousand times"" and then knows kung fu. They had the opportunity to really cross the generational gap by coming up with some original takes on ""paint the fence"", ""wax the car"", ""sand the floor"". I remember as a kid spending hours joking around with friends mimicking these motions. Now kids just get to hang up their jacket? I'm sure their parents love that their kids hang up jackets now but they are just missing out. I'm surprised they didn't do ""make your bed"", ""brush your teeth"", ""clean the dishes"". If they are going to follow the original script then either fully commit or don't commit at all. This movie couldn't figure out if it was making fun of the original, redoing the original, or just going through some motions. What's shocking is how successful this movie was. It is obviously because of the terrific story and a whole new generation of kids watching this tale unfold for the first time. And i'm sure parents loved taking their kids to go see it because they can share something that meant so much to them 25 years ago. Let me save everyone from sitting through this mess and suggest that you can experience this story with your kids by watching the original. Even today, the original stands up much better than this disaster. this is easily my worst attempt at a review on IMDb and that's exactly what this film deserved.

A better karate kid would be Ralph Macchio reprising his role as Daniel LaRusso and have him become the mentor character teaching a bullied victim how to fight. Instead they cast Jakie Chan and do not use him like they should have. The whole plot could easily be taken apart. Where as 1-3 actually all went together and continued off of each other. This is one of those times were the film should never have been remade. I mean yes there are times where the remake is good, however this is definitely not one of those. It is sad that today's generation will see this and think it is the karate kid. I will make sure my kids never see this movie. It makes me long for the one with Hillary swank. Which was just awful but at least it had Pat Morita in it as Mr. Miyagi and had the same lessons as the original trilogy. This had none of that.",The Karate Kid
483,chuonglepham,Poor choice for a remake (both film and actors),1,25 July 2014,"WHERE IS THE Japanese KARATE?! One could be forgiven for thinking the  producers have misspelt the title of the film, but seeing this is just  another B-movie from Chan, one wonders why it's called ""The Karate Kid""  in the first place?! Pat Morita would have rolled in his peaceful  slumber if he knew.  I guess, by now, most people would have been sickened with Chan's  monotonous, brain-dead, ""action hero"" (sic) role playing, and yet, the  studio gambled on such a farce release that not only insulted Japanese  Karate fans worldwide but also to a great classic franchise like the  original Karate Kid of Morita's and Macchio's fame.  Please, Mr Chan, you can't act, so no more action movies from you,  thank you! For the studios, I'm surprise that in this modern age that  you cannot find a talented Japanese, or Japanese-American actor to once  again reprise the role of Sensei once made famous by Pat Morita. Shame  of you!",The Karate Kid
484,martinmcintosh,Get past the title and the movie is fun,7,5 July 2010,"I loved the original as a kid and was disappointed to see a remake. But it is not truly a remake, the story is very similar but is fun on its own merit.I think the story may have been a little better if the characters had been a little older. I think 16 like the original is the right age, but that could be my bias based on the original.As much as I didn't want to like Jayden Smith, he is likable in the role. Jackie Chan's character could have been a little older, but he was spot on.So don't write it off and don't expect too much. Just watch it and have fun.",The Karate Kid
485,rimuchopra,Much better than the Original,9,20 May 2015,"I was surprised to see it rated at 6.1/10 on IMDb with a lot of negative reviews. The quality of the martial arts is much more convincing than that of the original. This movie also retains all the lessons of the original. I really loved the movie when I watched it in the movie hall, and not only that I watch it every time I can when it runs on TV. Maybe for some people it is the nostalgia they have with the original movie, can't really blame them. The only thing I would add in the movie is another fight of Jackie Chan with the opposite side coach, but this movie nevertheless is a great watch. The background music and sounds are much better than the original. To be fair though the original movie was made at a time when the technology and movie making tools were not that refined. Now things are much more professional and this current lot did have a huge advantage over the original film makers. Not to mention that they got everything almost ready from the original karate kid all they had to do was to improve upon what the first makers did.",The Karate Kid
486,mastersound-30856,Excellent Film,10,16 October 2015,"A well-rounded film - great camera-work and music score, which underscores the action perfectly. Jaden Smith is a revelation as a young actor and interprets his parts like an old pro. Jackie Chan is faultless. it should not be compared to the original film - it is a new and fresh version. Moving and well-composed throughout. Surprised me at how well it was assembled. Thoroughly enjoyable. I particularly liked the oriental locations and the mass movement scenes, all in choreographed outfits. The 'baddie' and his school of vicious pupils was not over-played, but believable. I enjoyed the way they all bowed to the superior trainer at the end.",The Karate Kid
487,thefulgid,"Clearly a remake, but doesn't fall short",8,3 July 2016,"Let's be honest, this was not an original idea nor did they try to hide it. But remake doesn't mean bad. I was very skeptical of this movie when first encouraged me to watch it, and didn't know quite what to expect. I greatly enjoyed the 1984 classic, as it was a nostalgic part of my childhood, and after living in China myself I always get disappointed when seeing poor attempts to recreate Asian culture and lifestyle. But where the original film excelled, this movie enhanced.Sherry Parker (Taraji Henson) gets a new job in China and moves there with her son Dre (Jaden Smith). While there, Dre, lead focus of the movie, meets a friend in Meiying. Immediately the neighborhood bully takes a disliking to this, and is at odds with Smith the rest of the movie, simply on principle. During a particular chase scene through the streets, Dre is saved outside his home by the maintenance man, Mr. Han (Jakie Chan). After this incident Han decides to teach Dre kung fu as a means of learning defense, discipline, and respect.This movie excellently captured both the magic and majesty of the original. Young Smith is not a world class actor and some of the lines felt more rehearsed than natural, but as a 10-11 year old at time of filming he can't be held to the same standard as his iconic father. That being said, he still played his part exceptionally well, and he wasn't the only one. Henson was definitely an overbearing mother, and it's plain to see where Dre picks up his disrespect and lack of discipline. Chan, as always, delivers nothing the best, and it's refreshing to see him in a role where he is known for more than just comedic lines and exemplary martial art skills. Motivation for each character was obvious, and you begin to feel real emotion for each in their situation. Cheng, the bully, acts like a 12 year old bully would act. Dre reacts like a 12 year old would act when confronted with something beyond his control, while not wanting to admit to anyone that he's afraid. His mom, as a busy single parent, is pleased when her son finally starts to accept their new surroundings and is willing to give him the liberty required to fit in, especially when she sees how beneficial learning kung fu becomes.What truly makes this movie stand out from the original is the beautiful change of location, moving from chaotic city life to the much different paced orient. Director Harald Zwart did an excellent job capturing the true taste of what it's like to live in China. There's no reason to believe that this movie does not hold up to the first Karate Kid movie (despite not being about karate). The scenarios were lifted directly from it, and the story is pretty much verbatim. Anyone who enjoyed it 30 years ago will enjoy it now. The characters are real, act real, feel real. The motivation for each one's actions is obvious, and it's plain to anyone who watches with an open opinion that this movie does a great job of recapturing what made the original great. It took an old movie that many loved, dusted it off, polished it up, and presented it in a new way and in a land that is only recently starting to blossom in the modern world. I will definitely be watching this again.",The Karate Kid
488,torre-67195,A worthy-ish remake,7,15 September 2021,"Imagine you get a task. A task that when you see it, you think there is no way people will accept it.That's the biggest issue. The way people just see this as a remake of a legendary movie. If you manage to let Mr. Miyagi stay in his movie and let Jackie have a different one, it is a pretty good movie.Sure, it does have a bit too much «hollywood» in it, I'll agree!I think Jackie Chan plays his role fantasticly well, putting aside his aquired american-ness and stepping into his chinese shoes.Jaden Smith was very young when playing here, so keep that in mind. He'd be out of this world if he delivered perfect acting at the age of 12 (?), but obviously he fell short once in a while. Even though I'd say he played his role well, as it kind of made his character feel young as well.The whole Kung-Fu vs. Karate thing still confuse me a bit, I have to say. In fairness, a good movie, family friendly, hints of romance... A good overall movie.",The Karate Kid

Therefore, my opinion of this movie is not based on any comparison of the original, it is stand-alone. I also never review movies on IMDb, but I really liked this movie and people are being unfair.I thought the movie was pretty good. I thought the acting was good, the story was good, and I liked getting to see China.It looks like most people who hate this movie are comparing it to the old version. According to my bf, there are differences, but who would watch a movie that was exactly the same? Why remake it then? If you've never seen any original Karate Kid movies, you are probably more likely to like this movie. If you have seen those movies, watch this movie with comparing. Who knows, you might like it as a stand-alone movie.",The Karate Kid

492,sarahatack,We loved it!,8,10 October 2017,"Covered bullying, self-defense, the difference between a good and a bad teacher, honor, respect, keeping a promise, how to study, different cultures (even... opposing cultures), hard work, ethic, perseverance, character development through suffering. The main character has a lot of reason to complain, and yet it's not the predominant theme of the movie. Instead, he rises again and again, copes with defeat, and you watch him get progressively stronger through the whole story, climaxing with the scene where we see his motives no longer are trying to punish his bullies, or be able to boast in his own strength, but he desires to press on because he's still afraid and doesn't want to be imprisoned by his fear. This driving motivation enables him to exhibit the most self control yet, and he emerges fearless.",The Karate Kid

Silly plot, sad story...the only bright spot is Chan...He is as always, Jackie Chan..I hope he continues with the genre, but the kid needs to let others with real talent and no famous parents to get the chance they work for..Nuff said.OK, maybe not, they want more line so..This famous parent thing is just sad..almost every kid with a famous parent or parents, thinks he/she is famous just for being born, you know..like Paris Hilton.",The Karate Kid
494,panjabi_boss,Kind interesting,7,6 November 2017,"If you've seen ""The Karate Kid"" (1984), the memories will come back during this 2010 remake. That's a compliment. The original story was durable enough to inspire three sequels, and now we have an entertaining version filmed mostly on location in China, with 56-year-old Jackie Chan in the role of Mr. Miyagi.The original was one of its year's best movies. The new one lacks the perfect freshness of that one. There is a website called https://which- martialarts.com/ which definitely will help those who want to train selfdefence and don't know which martial art to choose, find the right one.The movie is definitely recommendable.",The Karate Kid

I am not going to give anything away as many of you want to see it. However it is safe to say this will not score well with people who are fans of the original. The plot has too many holes. Jaden Smith's acting is disgusting and he should not do movies. The only good thing about this was Jackie Chan, but this was not one of his best movies. I do not see Jaden Smith becoming a star like his father or even close, maybe he should find another profession. This movie may do well for young kids, but not for anyone above the age of 14 or even anyone who is a fan. I believe it is safe to say Jaden Smith ruined this movie.",The Karate Kid
