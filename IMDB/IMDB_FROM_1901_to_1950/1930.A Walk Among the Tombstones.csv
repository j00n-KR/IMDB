0,SnoopyStyle,more dark thriller from Liam Neeson,6,27 June 2015,"In 1991, NYPD detective Matthew Scudder (Liam Neeson) shoots three holdup men. In 1999, Matt is now a private eye and 8 years sober. Drug trafficker Kenny Kristo hires him to find the men who kidnapped his wife and killed her even after getting paid. He discovers other cases and suspects that the killers are connected to the DEA. He is helped by street kid TJ. The driver Jonas Loogan is guilt-ridden and commits suicide. Then the two psychopaths kidnap a young girl.This is a dark, dark, dark thriller. It's so dark that there isn't much fun in the thrills. That's what's missing for me. This feels tired rather than exciting. It's not shocking or even disturbing. It is simply unrelenting. Liam Neeson has become the goto guy for this type of movies but maybe he's over-saturated. He does do phone calls in this one and that's always interesting.",A Walk Among the Tombstones
1,Prismark10,A leaden walk among the tombstones,3,21 March 2015,"This is a downbeat, moody slow burner of a thriller which comes across as rather sluggish and grim. Liam Neeson plays Matt Scudder, ex cop, ex alcoholic now an unlicensed private eye.A drug dealer's (Dan Stevens) wife gets kidnapped and even though a ransom was paid she was brutally killed. His brother gets Scudder to become involved in the case. It seems that this is not the only kidnapping the killers have been involved in and they are also creepy, cunning and sadistic. They seem to have no intention of letting the kidnap victims walk free.This is not an action packed violent thriller like Taken. Neeson is introspective, trying to reconcile past mistakes. The film displays a dark eerie atmosphere but even then it is still generic and clichéd but also listless.The finale is nicely done as we see Neeson having a showdown with the killers but even then we have silliness from Stevens who is rather inept in his revenge for his wife.",A Walk Among the Tombstones
2,claudio_carvalho,Gloomy Crime Film,7,26 April 2016,"In 1991, In New York, Matt Scudder (Liam Neeson) is an alcoholic police detective. In 1999, Scudder is retired from the police and is a private investigator without license. When his comrade Peter Kristo (Boyd Holbrook) from the rehab invites him to visit his brother Kenny Kristo (Dan Stevens), who is a drug dealer, Scudder learns that Kenny's wife Ann Carrie Kristo (Razane Jammal) had been abducted and cut into pieces by the kidnappers. Now Kenny wants to find the killer to revenge. Scudder initially refuses the case but then he accepts to investigate. Soon he finds that the killers have murdered other women connected to drug dealers and they get their files from the DEA. When the fourteen year-old daughter of a drug dealer is also kidnapped, Scudder heads up a group to rescue the teenager.""A Walk among the Tombstones"" is a gloomy crime film developed in slow pace, but with a complex story. The plot is realistic and the viewer follows Scudder investigation. The screenplay does not have a plot point with surprising revelations or action scenes; indeed it is indeed old- fashioned. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): ""Caçada Mortal"" (""Deadly Hunt"")",A Walk Among the Tombstones
3,nogodnomasters,IT WASN'T AS MUCH FUN AFTER THAT,5,20 December 2018,"The film opens up with Matt Scudder (Liam Neeson) doing a watered down version of a ""Dirty Harry"" scene. Eight years later in 1999, Matt is no longer a cop, but a private detective and is eight years sober. He is contacted by a man about a case as we soon discover a couple of guys are kidnapping the wives of rich drug traffickers, demanding ransom, and then killing their victims anyway.Matt is aided by some unlikely characters and follows his 12 step program, which we painfully get to hear, as he goes after the bad guys.This is an okay me-too ""Dirty Harry"" film, but nothing that great. The characters were not entertaining. The dialogue was bland, especially for us who have had the misfortune to never participate in a 12 step program. What the heck was that all about?",A Walk Among the Tombstones
4,kosmasp,"Not like Taken, but taken",6,24 March 2015,"This is a slow paced thriller, starring Liam Neeson who seems to be the new action star at the moment. An unlikely one and if you've seen Taken 3, you just hope they won't put him into to many foot chase scenes from here on out (or cut them better together). But it's not only about him, it's about other characters as well. Many on the wrong side of the law (obviously), but still not the real bad guys here.The action scenes are little and come from time to time, this is more about telling a story (though there is not much to tell if you really think about it). There is tension and a lot of characters to keep track of on the other hand. It's nicely paced if you like your thrillers to take their time, if not you'll be bored from time to time.",A Walk Among the Tombstones
5,classicsoncall,"""Who would like to read the twelve steps?""",8,5 October 2014,"Lately I've begun wondering whether movies help identify the truly abhorrent and evil behavior that human beings are capable of performing, or if they might actually help instruct and enable the depraved derelicts of society to do them. The two scumbags in this picture, ably portrayed by David Harbour and Adam David Thompson, were seriously demented characters, and it was startling to imagine that the father of the kidnapped girl thought that Scudder (Liam Neeson) would have a better chance of success if he used reason and didn't try to antagonize them. To my mind, that's exactly the upside down thinking that strict proponents of gun control believe will lead to less crime. Sorry for that little rant but the movie set it up brilliantly.As a movie thriller this one was OK but it seemed somewhat formulaic. Bad guys do their evil deeds and good guy comes to the rescue and all the rest is how he gets there. Liam Neeson's character at least had an interesting if tragic back story which supported his occupation as an independent investigator. In a way his relationship with young TJ (Brian 'Astro' Bradley) might have seemed out of character in any other story but it worked here OK. Scudder told the kid how it was without trying to patronize him and that was cool. I didn't think the kid was going to shoot himself in the head for a minute.You know, I had a sit up and 'Whoa' moment during the basement scene right after Albert (Thompson) garroted Ray (Harbour) and left him lying for dead. When Scudder came downstairs, Ray was sitting and propped up against the wall - how did that happen? It made me think that maybe Ray wasn't dead after all, and would have been a cheap gimmick if he wasn't, but he stayed dead. So I don't see a rational explanation for that one other than a goof, but that was a big one.So with the movie's date of reference being 1999, there were ubiquitous references to Y2K that served to remind us all that that was another worry the mass media hyped at the time that turned out to be nothing. But the other thing, and this was kind of creepy in a way, the closing shot of the movie had a pan of the Twin Towers, perhaps a subliminal walk among the tombstones that wasn't intended.",A Walk Among the Tombstones
6,lee_eisenberg,"OK, so what's this Matthew Scudder series?",5,19 January 2015,"In the 1990s and 2000s, Liam Neeson was known as one of the great actors. He starred in ""Schindler's List"", ""Rob Roy"", ""Les Miserables"", ""Kinsey"" and ""Breakfast on Pluto"". He even played Obi-Wan Kenobi's mentor in the otherwise reviled ""Phantom Menace"". For some reason in the 2010s, Neeson has starred in a series of action flicks. Yes, the man once known as Oskar Schindler now plays the characters that Harrison Ford - another veteran of the ""Star Wars"" universe and Neeson's co-star in ""K-19: The Widowmaker"" - would have played in previous decades.So now the former Jean Valjean stars in an adaptation of a novel that was apparently part of a whole series. I've never heard of the Matthew Scudder series until now. Now that I've seen ""A Walk Among the Tombstones"", I'll say that I didn't see much different from the other action flicks in which the former Qui-Gon Jinn has starred in the past few years, so I don't recommend the movie.I wonder if Liam Neeson will ever appear in a serious movie again.",A Walk Among the Tombstones
7,jboothmillard,A Walk Among the Tombstones,3,18 August 2019,"I heard the title of this film a few times while it was playing in cinemas, I missed it, then I missed it a number of times when it kept showing on TV for a couple of years, I decided to rent it and see if I was missing out on anything good, or bad. Basically, in New York City, Matthew ""Matt"" Scudder (Liam Neeson) is a former police detective with a chequered, alcoholic past. He is now retired and works as an unlicensed private investigator operating just outside the law. Matt is approached by drug addict Peter Kristo (Boyd Holbrook), and asks him to help his brother Kenny (Dan Stevens). Kenny is a drug trafficker whose wife was kidnapped and murdered. He tells Matt that after he delivered the ransom, the kidnappers directed him to a car containing his wife's dismembered body. Matt ultimately agrees to find the kidnappers. At the library, Matt researches similar killings, and meets a homeless youth named TJ (Brian ""Astro"" Bradley), who helps with his search. Matt goes to a cemetery and speaks with the groundskeeper, Jonas Loogan (Olafur Darri Olafsson), who found bags containing parts of the dismembered Leila in the cemetery pond. Matt talks to Leila's fiancé Reuben Quintana (Mark Consuelos), who claims to have witnessed the kidnapping. Matt meets with Jonas again, at the top of an apartment building with a tool shed, it contains photos of Reuben and Leila having sex. Jonas admits that he helped kidnap Leila. He was working with Reuben to help her stop using drugs but had no idea that the two kidnappers would torture and kill Leila. Jonas gives Matt the name of one of the two men, Ray, and jumps off the roof to his death. The two kidnappers, Ray (David Harbour) and Albert (Adam David Thompson), are preparing to target another victim. They were originally going to take the wife of Yuri Landau (Sebastian Roché), another drug trafficker. But realise she is bedridden, so they instead kidnap his 14-year-old daughter Lucia (Danielle Rose Russell). While Matt finds connections with the victims and the DEA, he grows closer to TJ, and encourages him to study and avoid a life of crime. He tells TJ why he retired from the police, it was eight years ago in 1991, during a shootout, that a stray bullet Matt fired at an assailant accidentally hit and killed a 7-year-old girl, he has been sober ever since. Kenny brings Matt to Landau's home, where the kidnappers call and arrange a drop. Matt knows that the kidnappers intend to kill the girl after the ransom is paid, so he does what he can to make sure this will not happen, bargaining with them during the call. The drop takes place at the cemetery, after a stand-off, Lucia is returned to his father. When Albert realises the ransom money is counterfeit, a shootout ensues. Peter is killed, and Matt wounds Ray. Albert and Ray escape in their van, but with TJ sneaked in the back. After Albert and Ray arrive at their place, TJ sneaks out of their van, calls Matt, and tells him the address. Albert garrottes the wounded Ray in the basement, and goes back upstairs to find Matt, Kenny, and TJ. Albert is overpowered and cuffed by Matt. Matt calls a cab for TJ, Albert frees himself, and when Matt goes back inside, he finds Kenny dead. Albert attacks Matt, and after a brief fight, Matt kills him. Matt returns home to find TJ sleeping on the couch and a drawing that TJ made of himself as a superhero, he sits down and falls asleep. Also starring Laura Birn as Leila Andresen and Marielle Heller as Marie Gotteskind. Neeson does his usual craggy hero thing, less well than perhaps Taken and other films, Stevens is shifty, and Astro is okay, there is nothing really original, a former cop investigates a kidnapping and murder, finds out about other cases, and goes against the criminals, it has daft dialogue, and only some violence and action picks it up a little, it is just a very average crime thriller. Adequate!",A Walk Among the Tombstones
8,rmax304823,"Complex, Human.",7,6 December 2015,"Liam Neeson is finally out of his ""Taken"" franchise and gets a chance to perform as a human being rather than just act. He's an unlicensed private detective who resigned from the NYPD after accidentally shooting and killing a little girl after drinking. He's since joined AA.He's hired by a civilized-sounding drug dealer whose wife was kidnapped. The dealer wants to know who they are, since he's paid the ransom and the kidnappers tortured and killed her anyway, cutting her up into little pieces and distributing them in trash bags here and there. Neeson digs into the case a little and finds that two or three men have been doing the same thing for some time -- not just serial killers, but genuine menaces to humanity.Neesom acquires a kind of acolyte, a black kid who has sickle cell anemia (don't worry; no bathos) and loves private eyes like Sam Spade. Neesom himself plays the role as subdued. Not subdued because he's not bothering to animate the character, but subdued in the sense that he seems like a perfectly normal, if wary, kind of guy. He's not the whirling dervish of the ""Taken"" movies at all. He can be coshed and beaten painfully and suffer from the beating for hours afterward. (Again, no bathos; this is part of his life.) No love interest, no spectacular shoot outs, nobody's head is wrenched off, no wisecracks. It's a tense and suspenseful movie about a good man trying to do something worthwhile and trying to cope with his weaknesses.Neesom can be a fine actor given the right role. He has an endearingly lumpy face and his nose begins in the middle of his forehead. It's well worth catching.",A Walk Among the Tombstones

11,Scarecrow-88,A Walk Among the Tombstones,7,26 November 2015,"Grim-faced Liam Neeson stars as a former NYC cop, unlicensed PI, and recovering alcoholic brought into a dangerous situation involving drug traffickers and the two one-time functionaries in the DEA who happened across their files while working for the government (in whatever capacity that seems undetermined) that extort from them (and kill their kidnapped loved ones after receipt of payment). Neeson's Matt Scudder is asked by a drug trafficker (Dan Stevens) to find the ones responsible for killing his wife, supposedly after he paid a ransom for her return (the body found in numerous pieces in bags). Matt met this trafficker's brother, Peter (Boyd Holbrook), at an addicts meeting, and their association has them eventually in a cat-and-mouse with psychopaths Ray and Albert (David Harbour and Adam David Thompson). Ray is gabby and full of wicked glee while Albert is subdued, cold, and detachedthey live together, drive around in a white van, pursue the drug traffickers on the files they secured, build a kidnap plot, take their women, ask for ransom, and typically butcher those kidnapped, chopping up the bodies in their basement, and tossing off the bagged body parts in areas of their city. Scudder plans to find them and stop them. When a Russian trafficker's daughter is taken, Scudder will negotiate a meet-and-swap, but, of course, it all goes down violently.Provided a character with more meat on the bones than usual, Neeson morosely works the PI beat with a clever, intuitive mind and determined drive, befriending a discarded African-American youth named TJ (Astro) he tries to offer paternal and streetwise advice to so he can survive. A bullet to the eye of a little girl during a shootout with three grocery store hoods changed Scudder's life for good. This film has a subversive edge to it thanks to the two killers-kidnappers involved and Scudder's own journey to find them, often encountering all kinds of dangers along the way as the city offers its peril to him. The garrote shows up, as does the knife, taser, and gun, and there's plenty of unpleasantness Scudder must find his way through to get to the killers. As you might have guessed, the ending particularly is violent. Neeson, once again, carries the film, an anchor of surefootedness, ably convincing as this flawed man looking for redemption and absolution, perhaps getting his chance when a little girl is kidnapped. The shady characters opposite him aren't stereotypes, as the actors portraying them are given multi-faceted human beings using the drug trade as a means to live and thrive (the Russian has a bedridden invalid wife lost to the world he must take care of), but they aren't one-dimensional caricatures which is a plus in the film's favor. The dreary, crime-infested cityscape is quite a setting for Neeson's melancholy PI to work within. Ray and Albert are a creepy duo; one scene shows them sitting around a table eating breakfast while Ray comments that Y2K, listed on the front page of the newspaper, is not what the city should be worried about. A flashback involving a third partner of Ray and Albert's, for which Scudder questions, is certainly perhaps the most unsettling point in the movie.",A Walk Among the Tombstones
12,LeonLouisRicci,Gritty Neo-Noir That Captivates Despite a Misstep or Two,8,23 March 2015,"An Excellent Screenwriter, Scott Frank, Directs this Neo-Noir with the Unlikely Action Hero, a 62 Year Old Liam Neeson.

Filmed in the Rain and On Gritty Streets and Dilapidated Buildings it Sets a Tone of Foreboding Not the Least are the Two Psycho/Sadist that Seem to Kidnap, Mutilate, and Rape Their Victims and Also Get Their Money.They Will Get the Comeuppance, that is Never in Doubt, but Getting There is Thing of Novels and this is Pulp Pure and Simple. When the Movie is Dealing with the Psychos and the Drug Dealer Families it is at its Best. The Film Also Excels at Interesting Offbeat Characters that Populate the Mean Streets, Like a Weirdo Who Raises Pigeons.However, the Movie is Not Without Some Missteps. The Inclusion of a Homeless Teen is Hokey. Can't Imagine Sam Spade or Philip Marlowe Parenting Such a Cliché. It is a Modern Sensibility that Doesn't Fit. It Doesn't Ruin the Movie but it Also Doesn't Help.Speaking of Not Helping, the Ending Freeze Frame, 12-Step Recital is Another Modernism that is Not Welcome in Such a Downbeat, Scuzzy, Thriller. Once Again it Almost Ruins, but Not Quite, the Effective, Bleak, Camera Work that Had Framed the Film to That Point.Overall, it is a Good and Stylish Attempt at a Throwback to the Detective Genre.

13,CinemaSerf,Basic detective yarn told well...,6,13 May 2020,"This had the advantage of the, sparing, participation of Dan Stevens; so was always going to be worth watching - and it actually is. A dodgy drug dealer (DS) calls in retired cop Liam Neeson when his wife is kidnapped and then brutally murdered. Initially, Neeson declines to get involved, but when he discovers just quite how she was killed he sets off to track down the culprits. In a bit of a parallel storyline, we have some idea as to who the criminals are and that they are also continuing to target similar targets - it's a race against time now. Neeson, and his new, streetwise young pal ""TJ"" (Astro) gel well and as the investigation gathers pace this becomes quite a suspenseful pyscho-thriller. It rather hits the skids with fifteen minutes, or so, to go though - the ending left me puzzled and disappointed in pretty much equal measure.",A Walk Among the Tombstones
14,utgard14,Watchable if expectations are kept low,5,26 January 2015,"Liam Neeson movies rarely disappoint me. I wouldn't say this one does that but it is somewhat underwhelming. No, it's not because it's a crime thriller instead of an actioner. It's just because it's such a pedestrian crime thriller. It never builds to anything particularly memorable or offers anything new. Liam's good in it but it's the kind of part he can do in his sleep. His scenes with the kid played by Astro are the best parts of the film. I was ready to write Astro off after Earth to Echo but maybe he has some talent after all. The bad guys are creepy and gross but, other than having the less memorable of the two be the last one standing, they bring little to the table we haven't seen before. Without knowing anything about this, I could tell it is adapted from a novel. It just has that feel to it. It's watchable and certainly not bad but really nothing special.",A Walk Among the Tombstones
15,zardoz-13,A Methodical First-Rate Suspense Thriller,9,16 January 2015,"""Lookout"" director Scott Frank's ""A Walk Among the Tombstones"" qualifies as a gripping but rather creepy thriller. Audiences didn't embrace this atmospheric murder mystery when Universal released it. This $28 million production coined $26 million domestically and another $26 million internationally, for a grand haul of $53 million. Presumably, audiences must have imagined that it would be like his far-fetched but entertaining ""Taken"" franchise. Actually, while he earned far less money than the ""Taken"" movies, ""A Walk Among the Tombstones"" is far more interesting with its offbeat anti-hero and its two warped murderers. Writer & director Scott Frank adapted Lawrence Block's thriller and created a number of compelling characters as well as sinister villains for his yarn about two enigmatic individuals who like to abduct women off the street in broad daylight, haul them away their van, and then carve them up for the sadistic pleasure that they derive from doing it. Squeamish spectators are warned in advance to approach this one with discretion. The villains contact people close to these unfortunate women and offer to return them for a ransom, but they refuse to hold up their end of the bargain. They kidnap a drug dealer's girlfriend, chop her up into brick-sized packages, and leave her in the trunk of an abandoned car. Far from being an invincible champion like Bryan Mills in the ""Taken"" franchise, Matt Scudder (Liam Neeson of ""Non-Stop"") is a former NYPD detective with an alcohol problem. He attends Alcoholics Anonymous and Scott incorporates material from AA into his screenplay, particularly in a graveyard stand-off scene. It seems Scudder was minding his own business sitting in a bar when three killers barged in and blew away the bartender. When they saw him, the killers cut loose on Scudder. Scudder returned fire, pursued them into the street, and kept blasting away until he had killed them all. During this fracas, an innocent bystander—a seven year old girl--took one of Scudder's stray slugs through her eye and died instantly. Although he received a departmental commendation, Scudder quit the force after this incident. Since he has quit the force and joined Alcohols Anonymous, Scudder makes his living as an unlicensed private eye. Peter Kristo (Boyd Holbrook), the brother of Kenny Kristo (Dan Stevens), approaches Scudder because he knows him from his AA meetings. Kenny needs help because two men have kidnapped his wife and he cannot go to the authorities. While he searches for these two homicidal fiends, Scudder befriends a homeless African-American urchin, TJ (Brian 'Astro' Bradley), and the kid serves as a gopher. Mind you, this suspenseful New York City saga is unconventional and somewhat off the beaten path that Neeson has taken since he became an action-hero in the first ""Taken"" movie. One of the creepiest characters is an accomplice who works as a grounds keeper at a cemetery. Scudder and he meet on the roof of a building where the grounds keeper raises birds. The grounds keeper tells Scudder how he meet the two men who had somehow acquired DEA files on certain drug dealers. After their conversation, the frightened grounds keeper, clearly fearing reprisal from the killers, steps off the roof and plunges to his death. Lenser Mihai Malaimare Jr. captures the grit and grime of the urban sprawl of jungle. The only drawback to ""A Walk Among the Tombstones"" is that you know the protagonist isn't going to die because Block has written so many novels about him. The two killers that he pursues are pure evil. Our hero is a vulnerable guy, and his ultimate fight with the villains in their basement is chilling.",A Walk Among the Tombstones

Despite some puzzling aspects (why is it set in 1999? What was the purpose of TJ's sickle-cell disease and his propensity for drawing super-heroes? Why run through the AA creed during the climactic sequence?), it is a decent crime thriller with some very dark aspects to it. Yes, it is violent, but the violence is not particularly graphic: the worst of it is delivered verbally and by suggestion Leeson delivers another decent ageing action man performance, and the rest of the cast are also good, with very few recognisable names and faces among them.

18,ferguson-6,Walk Like a Man,6,18 September 2014,"Greetings again from the darkness. Welcome to the annual off-season gift from Liam Neeson. Seemingly every year, he provides us with a February or September release that requires his particular set of tough guy skills. This time, he plays Matthew Scudder - of the popular Lawrence Block crime novel series (17 books).Director Scott Frank (The Lookout) works to create a 1970's feel, although the film opens up as a flashback to 1991, and quickly fast forwards to 1999 NYC. There are no shortage of clichés here, but nothing is over the top; and the bleak, somber, usually rainy setting establishes the tone that fits with ""unlicensed"" private detective Scudder's preferred method of living and detecting.Of course, Scudder is a recovering alcoholic and former cop, with a tragic, careless incident on his record and conscience. The film is so ever-bleak, that the moments of humor ... though often awkward and out of place ... are quite welcome. The only shining light of innocence comes courtesy of a sharp homeless kid named TJ, played by Brian ""Astro"" Bradley. TJ is a Philip Marlowe wannabe, and quickly assumes the role of Scudder's partner/intern/IT Department.Bad guys are everywhere. Even the serial killers (David Harbour, Adam David Thompson) target the family members of criminals, so as to minimize the involvement of the proper authorities. As an improper authority, we can't ask for better than Liam Neeson. He works for ""favors"", not a paycheck.Other support work comes courtesy of Dan Stephens (""Downton Abbey""), Boyd Holbrook, and creepy cemetery groundskeeper (is there another type?) Olafur Darri Olafsson, who creates yet another memorable character with limited screen time (see ""True Detective"").Mr. Neeson gets plenty of telephone action, which plays right into the strength of Taken, and it's pretty amazing how much WALKING he does throughout the story. He looks great walking in his duster, but it seems a bicycle would be more efficient ... though admittedly, much less daunting. As a whole, though the movie is probably a bit familiar, it's the little details and the powerful Liam Neeson that makes it a welcome late summer release.",A Walk Among the Tombstones
19,anaconda-40658,Nesson's Great Walk.,9,6 November 2015,"A Walk Among the Tombstones (2014): Dir: Scott Frank / Cast: Liam Neeson, Dan Stevens, David Harbour, Adam David Thompson, Brian ""Astro"" Bradley: Grim and dark thriller about descending through the realms of grief. Liam Neeson plays a former detective who gave up alcohol when a bar robbery results in innocent people being killed. He is lured out by a drug dealer whose wife was kidnapped by two criminally insane ex-cops. When he made the payoff, her body was returned in pieces. He demands revenge and needs Neeson to track them down. Surprisingly decent, if not shocking screenplay that plays more for plot than action, although there is plenty of that, as well as grim moments. Neeson plays his usual gritty persona yet he has rarely been better than this. He is dealing with the affects of alcohol as well as test his wit tracking down these killers before their sadistic urges surface again. Dan Stevens plays the drug dealer awaiting justice and to enact the penalty for the loss of his wife. David Harbour and Adam David Thompson are menacing as the two killers who demonstrate a sick sensation where victim survival is against a sexual high. Brian ""Astro"" Bradley steals moments as a homeless youth Neeson encounters in the library, and who evidently becomes a willing partner. Director Scott Frank tenses the atmosphere with gloom apartments, basements, alleys, and rooftops with caged birds. The message is lost in the brutality of the violence but those seeking a well written thriller that captivates and thrills to the end, then I suggest taking a walk amongst the tombstones.

21,gradyharp,'Once they're in the van they're just body parts.',10,14 June 2015,"There are some films that are so grisly that they are difficult to watch. A WALK AMONG THE TOMBSTONES is the cinematic adaptation (by director Scott Frank) of Lawrence Block's novel by the same name. Yes, it is an R rated for strong violence, disturbing images, language and brief nudity – not mentioning the dismemberment of human bodies – but the actors are so excellent and the director's sense of pacing and of what to show and what to suggest that the overall impression the film leaves is one of horror – but brilliance.Matt Scudder Liam Neeson) is a former cop now a private eye. He is asked by drug dealer Kenny Kristo (Dan Stevens, impressive in an American role) and his brother Peter (Boyd Holbrook) to find the men who kidnapped his wife. It seems like they killed her even after he paid them $400,000. (they had asked for 1 million). Scudder refuses. But the man later goes to see him and tells him the brutal manner of his wife was killed. Scudder takes the job. He does some research and thinks the men he is looking for have done this more than once. And that everyone they grabbed is connected to a drug dealer. He was about to give up when they grab another girl and Scudder tries to make sure she's returned alive. The sociopathic kidnappers are played with surety by David Harbour and Adam David Thomson. Their 'accomplice' is the fine actor Ólafur Darri Ólafsson who plays Jonas – in a very significant role. Matt befriends a street kid TJ (Astro aka Brian Bradley – a very talented youngster) who brings out Matt's sense of humanity. The supporting cast is extraordinarily fine – never has the underbelly of New York smelled so foul. The cinematography by Mihai Malaimare Jr. at all times matches the tenor of the film as does the music scoring by Carlos Rafael Rivera. B tin the end the reason the film works so well is due to the uncanny acting by Liam Neeson – right on target in a very rough role. It make take a strong stomach to watch, but for those who admire fine cinema, don't miss this overlooked film.",A Walk Among the Tombstones
22,SimonJack,"A dark, gruesome mystery that borders on the horror genre",6,24 September 2014,"Can modern-day authors no longer write great mysteries? So many movies today that Hollywood pans off as mystery-crime flicks might better be called crime-horror shows. Or, they are so gruesome as to border on that category. ""A Walk Among the Tombstones"" is just such a film -- however the industry chooses to label it. I haven't read the book that this film is based on, so I don't know if the book is weak, just the film is weak, or if both are weak.A few of the best mysteries of all time have been dark and brooding in their plot. But, in those very good stories and movies, the dark and brooding don't detract from or overpower the mystery. The reverse is true in most of the modern gruesome mysteries when the gore and horror overwhelm the plots. This film isn't quite that far off track, but the gruesomeness of the film takes over the attention of the audience before it's halfway through. So, the solution of the ""mystery"" comes with little impact. It's almost off-hand that Neeson's character, Matt Scudder, announces the conclusion that he has reached. There, to me, went the gist and substance and purpose and enjoyment of a mystery. Poof! And it was just made known. So the rest of this film fills out with more gore and horror as the ""good"" guys track down the two insane butchers. The acting is generally good in this film. But the script is choppy at times, and the cinematography is not that good. I don't get the suspense or intrigue or whatever was supposed to be conveyed by the several camera shots of the bad guys that didn't show their faces. Apparently, that was supposed to add mystery. But it only works in films when the characters are someone we see elsewhere in the plot, and when showing a face would reveal the bad guy prematurely to the story. Instead, here it gives an impression of simple hand-held camera shots. So, this and other ""conventions"" or nuances of making mysteries are used but out of place and of no substance. It's almost as though the producers tossed in some red herrings here and there to keep our interest up, and fill out an otherwise simple plot. I stayed until the end because Neeson's character begged the question: ""Will he stay sober or will he go back to the bottle?"" To the film makers' credit, the main character stuck to his guns and stayed sober throughout the ordeal. So, we were at least spared an old movie cliché of so many films of the past, where the hero or a main character slips back into demon rum. The value in this film is in Neeson's character and his friendship with the young homeless TJ. I can't recommend this film to mystery aficionados. And, I don't know why anyone watches such films for gore. That would seem to be something that this film's two culprits would do – watch the gore for enjoyment. So, why did I watch this in a theater? Because it starred Liam Neeson and it sounded to me as though it would be an interesting mystery film. But I was just half right. Give me a good old Dashiell Hammett or Agatha Christie mystery – book or film – any day. They will engross and intrigue me right up to the last, and it will be a time spent most enjoyably.",A Walk Among the Tombstones
23,siderite,A better use for Liam Neeson,8,29 January 2015,"For some reason people tend to associate Neeson with films like Taken rather than Schindler's List, forgetting that the man is a good actor before being an action star. A Walk Among the Tombstones veers from the action toward the psychological thriller, making better use of Liam Neeson the actor and avoiding pointless gun fight scenes and base emotion revenge killings. That doesn't mean that the film is a masterpiece - it is not - only that it deserves to be rated at least as high as flawed blockbuster action franchises starring the same actor.What I think confused viewers is how mundane it all is. The main character is an ex-cop going to AA meetings after a personal drama; the investigation is nothing special, just basic techniques, dumb luck and some skill; the killers are psychopaths, but no Se7enesque geniuses; the mood is dark, but nothing like The Dark Knight, it is just ugly reality; people are getting beaten up and killed and there is no one to righteously avenge them.Bottom line: a sort of slow paced thriller focusing on characters rather than action or some ingenious plot, it must have disappointed legions of Taken fans, but it is ultimately making a much better use of Liam Neeson, the actor.",A Walk Among the Tombstones
24,KineticSeoul,Too basic and bland mystery movie with hardly any mystery to it,5,28 May 2015,"This is a very basic mystery movie that doesn't have all that much mystery to it. So the main reason I wanted to check this movie out is because it has Dan Stevens in it, who I was impressed with in the movie ""The Guest"". But he just wasn't utilized that well, although that could have been do to the way the book this movie is based on was written. There just wasn't anything thrilling or had anything that really grabbed my attention. It just seemed like it mashed up elements from other detective movies into one. And when it comes to this genre it has been done better before. The only thing that really stood out to me about this movie was the sound effects, such as the recoil of the guns. But besides that I just found this movie to be bland and boring with couple of things going for it, but lacked the momentum to really mean anything. There really any isn't any twist and turns with almost no guessing game going on. You are handed the answers to what is mostly going on pretty early on. And it felt like as an audience you just seemed to view from the outside, seeing the characters trying to solve something you already know. Overall this is a pretty bland movie that is okay to just pass on. It isn't a awful movie but nothing really special when there is other better mystery movies out there.5/10",A Walk Among the Tombstones
25,sddavis63,Tailor-Made For Liam Neeson,8,10 March 2018,"""A Walk Among The Tombstones"" Is The Perfect Vehicle For Liam Neeson. He plays Matt Scudder - an ex-cop haunted by a troubled and alcoholic past who makes ends meet by working as an unlicensed private detective. He gets hired by a wealthy drug dealer to find the scum who kidnapped, raped, tortured and murdered his wife, and as he investigates he discovers that she isn't the only one who's fallen victim to the killers - they've been targeting the wives, girlfriends and daughters of wealthy drug dealers - and in the end the movie focuses on the desperate search for a 14-year old girl who's been taken by them.This movie is dark and suspenseful, and Scudder is a dark, troubled and gritty character. From the very beginning the viewer is drawn in because after only a few minutes we become aware of what's happening to these young women with creepy shots of one of the terrified victims being bound and touched by her captors. It's enough to make you feel sympathy for the victims. You want these guys to be caught. You want justice and/or revenge for what they've done. The movie plays on that. It avoids the temptation to become overly graphic with what's happened to the victims. Just a few shots every now and then make things clear. There's a tense and sombre feel to this from the very beginning and that mood never really goes away.Neeson was superb. This character fit him to a ""t."" I was basically unfamiliar with the rest of the cast. They all did well enough. But they're not what I would consider big name actors. This was Neeson's movie. He would be the draw - his presence in the cast was why I chose to watch this - and he does not disappoint.There were a couple of things here that didn't work especially well for me. I wasn't entirely clear on how Scudder made the connection between the various killings as quickly as he did, and the character of T.J. - a homeless boy who befriends Scudder and becomes his sort-of partner - seemed extraneous to me. The movie could have worked perfectly well without him and I never really understood the point of his presence. But those are relatively minor quibbles. This is a very good movie with a story and performance from Neeson that are first-rate. (8/10)",A Walk Among the Tombstones
26,Hellmant,This is not an action movie!,6,26 September 2014,"'A WALK AMONG THE TOMBSTONES': Three Stars (Out of Five)Moody crime thriller starring Liam Neeson as a recovering alcoholic private investigator, named Matthew Scudder. Scudder is a popular character featured in a series of New York crime novels, written by Lawrence Block. In this film (based on the book of the same name) the P.I. is hired by a drug trafficker, to find the men who kidnapped and brutally murdered his wife. It was written and directed by Scott Frank; a veteran screenwriter who also performed both duties on the 2007 crime drama flick 'THE LOOKOUT'. It costars Dan Stevens, David Harbour, Adam David Thompson, Boyd Holbrook and Brian 'Astro' Bradley. It's stylistically a nice throwback to the 70s film noir cop movies of yesteryear but it's also excruciatingly slow and boring.Matthew Scudder is a former police detective who lost his job due to an alcoholic incident, while taking down three violent criminals. He now works as a private investigator, for hire, and draws the attention of a druggie, one day, named Peter (Holbrook). Peter asks him to meet his brother, Kenny Kristo (Stevens); a drug trafficker who wants Scudder to find the men that killed his wife. Scudder reluctantly takes the job and digs deep into the New York City crime underworld. While trying to solve the case he finds unlikely help from a homeless kid named T.J. (Astro).Those wanting to see Liam Neeson play an unstoppable badass, like he did in 'TAKEN', will be sorely disappointed. This is not an action movie; there are two well done action scenes in it (in the beginning and end) but that's it. This is a painfully slow paced crime mystery. Neeson is good in it and Frank does a good job setting the right grim mood, that's fitting to the material, but other than that the film is a completer bore. I'll give it three stars (out of five), still, because I think it does a good job of delivering the type of movie that some genre fans are looking for. I'm not one of them.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://youtu.be/SWKktTowhSI",A Walk Among the Tombstones

28,Lejink,Constant Graving,3,9 May 2021,"This is a strange one. On the face of it, it's just another variation on Neeson's continuing Indian Summer as a senior action-hero yet again on the trail of really bad guys, but within it is a curiously strange narrative and set of supporting characters.Set in New York in the year 1999 for reasons which aren't readily apparent, Neeson's character Matthew Scudder is a burnt-out, retired, recovering alcoholic ex-cop who's never gotten over years ago accidentally killing a child passer-by while under the influence in a downtown shoot-out but who now looks for work as a private eye.When he's apparently innocently asked by another A. A. attendee to assist his brother, he's soon drawn into the pursuit of a pair of psychopaths whose M. O. is to kidnap, use to extort and finally murder females connected to local drug barons. This leads to a passing run-in (and jump!) with a sleazy park ranger and a longer-term partnership with a homeless young black kid who wants to be a real-life detective in the style of Chandler or Hammett, but who unfortunately suffers from a rare blood disorder.So, kind of ""Se7en"" meets ""Man On Fire"" meets ""Taken"" as Neeson races against time to try to save the psychotic duo's latest target, the young daughter of a Russian gangster, from the same fate as previous victims which as you can guess means much blood is shed all the way to a dead-of-night final reckoning in a downstairs basement while the rain hammers down outside.I can just about accept Neeson in these sort of geriatric sub-Bourne/Bond outings but with its messy storyline and hotch-potch of characters and situations, this one never got off the ground. The pacing is slow, the narrative confused and ideas undeveloped leaving the final movie a confused mixture of half-developed strands that fails to cohere in the final analysis. For an example, look no further than one particularly bloody shoot-out, played out to the backdrop of an A. A. member reciting the list of credos from the organisation's handbook, maybe it was obliquely advocating abstention, but it just seemed confusingly odd.There are several grisly moments, but precious little in the way of originality in this grim, poorly-edited film which seems to exist for the sole purpose of getting our Liam back out in the big city, toting his guns and fist-fighting baddies again.In closing, to paraphrase Dylan I'm afraid this particular walk only left me with a dose of the tombstone blues.",A Walk Among the Tombstones
29,wellthatswhatithinkanyway,Neeson moves his new action man career in a more developed mould than Taken,9,30 June 2015,"STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning Following a traumatic incident in a bar a few years ago, Detective Matt Scudder (Liam Neeson) is now a private investigator, who takes on various tough assignments. The latest comes in the unlikely shape of Danny Ortiz (Maurice Compte), an entrepreneurial drug dealer whose wife was viciously murdered. Ortiz wants Scudder to help him track down those responsible, so he can enact revenge. But as Scudder digs deeper in to the case, he discovers this crime is just one of many that a group of corrupt cops are targeting against the spouses of big time drug dealers. With the help of streetwise delinquent TJ (Astro), he must race against time to bring them down.Now in the later stages of his life and career, Liam Neeson has topped the niche market of older guys in action hero roles, managing a smooth, savvy charisma that a lot of the testosterone fuelled younger guys probably couldn't manage. While Taken and it's subsequent sequels are the films that laid the foundations for his re-birth in this mould, they have lead to a stream of such movies ever since, including Non-Stop, and this more considered, mature effort.The trouble may be that it was simply marketed a bit too much like those previous movies, and suffers from a less than appealing title, a shame, as Scott Frank has crafted a film that's shot in an absorbing, enriching style, with an eloquent soundtrack, and has a more intricate, intelligent plot to follow that requires your full attention. While the 'sidekick' device has fallen to the wayside a little over the years, here it reignites with a passion, as TJ proves the most engaging partner in years, a street-kid with more intelligence than meets the eye.It loses it's sense of pace a little towards the end, and maybe goes on a little longer than it should, but it's still a superior action thriller, with a brain, imagination and heart. ****",A Walk Among the Tombstones
30,bowmanblue,A solid little mystery-thriller (not 'Taken 4' though),7,21 January 2015,"Liam Neeson has enjoyed a renaissance lately, reinventing himself as an 'elder statesman' of action movies, what with the 'Taken' trilogy and 'Non Stop.' Therefore, I couldn't help but go into 'A Walk Among the Tombstones' thinking that it was going to be another 'blast-a-thon' of gunplay and high-octane action. It wasn't.I even – briefly – read a post on the internet concerning the film. It simply read 'Totally dull.' To be fair, I can see where they're coming from. If you go into this film expecting something like Taken then you're going to be left sorely disappointed. Luckily, when I watched it, I was obviously okay with something a little slower.Liam Neeson plays... well, basically the same badass character he keeps playing lately – you don't really need to know his name. He could almost be the same guy in Taken. But, anyway, he's an ex cop turned private detective who's hired to investigate the kidnap and murder of a drug dealer's wife. First of all there's comparatively little action, despite quite an intense opening shootout, there's not that much else to follow (besides the odd 'roughing up' of a few shady characters here and there. The story is mainly about Neeson's investigation, which he does with hunches and leads, rather than guns and fists.Normally, I say that characters work best when they interact with others around them. Liam Neeson is definitely a 'lone wolf' here and I actually preferred him that way. However, the film-makers decided to make him 'play off' a young homeless kid he sort of befriends along the way. I felt that this was the one down point in the film. It wasn't the young actor's fault. He could definitely act, I just didn't really believe a young homeless boy would be so into the things he was, i.e. health conscious and water-drinking to 'flush out his system' etc. But he's comparatively a minor part of the two-hour film.So, if you're in the mood for something a little slower than Neeson's recent offerings then give it ago.

There is a constant eerie atmosphere which keeps you awaiting something huge.Unfortunately, nothing huge ever really comes, every twist and tum throughout is expected, it's something you would see in any other thriller, there is no shocking or unexpected moment. I was not fond of the scenes between Matt and TJ. The writers were clearly going for a ""wise man helps damaged kid"" scenario that was meant to add heart to to the film, which I think mostly failed, as Astro speaks like he hates Neeson for the entire movie, there is absolutely no chemistry between them.

But movies like TAKEN are a crapshoot, a gamble, a party trick where you are constantly trying to find something new and different to resonate with the audience, to make up for the fact that there is little substance to the project. (As was proved by TAKEN 2, one of the worst movies I have ever seen, with some of the most glaring editing mistakes).Here we go old school. Written by one of the best writers of the last century and directed by Scott Frank, a man who certainly knows how to frame a scene for mood and impact. (At the half way point, a girl in a red hood crosses the street in front of the villains. The scene should not have memorable, but Frank makes it so).An ""old school"" classic. Three quarters of a century ago, even Bogey would have taken this part. And been the better for it.Young ""Astro"" who plays the ghetto-smart TJ steals all his scenes and, for those with a good ear, even channels the speech patterns of Will Smith, from any movie Smith ever appeared in.

However though, she's already dead, Kenny tells us, and he wants the men responsible for killing her. We're treated to a flashback sequence in which the particulars of her shanghaiing are detailed, and the film instantly adopts a newly macabre mien. It's depicting, though it's never terribly graphic. This flick mercifully favors suggestion over depiction. Somehow, that makes it more twisted; our brains have a way of giving off-screen mutilations a visual form. This film is adapted from a novel which is very evident its storyline and plot, and sub-characters. We see the story take place then by the end, we see the final product as everything is tied together. Some of it is predictable, however there are several great twists and turns, and important info being shared which is important to pay close attention to specific detail. Typical Liam Neesen fans of his Taken films may have expected this to be another one of his standard action film, but it is far from that, and Neesen delivers one of his better performances. The writing and directing is really solid.

What really convinces Scudder that he's on to something, a mob government link in all this, is when Greenwood Cemetery worker Jonas Loogan, Olafur Darri Olafsson, who discovered Carries body parts flouting in the cemetery's lake, and who very probably stored them in the car trunk where they were discovered, jumped to his death when Scudder confronted him about his actions.****SPOILERS**** The usual hot tempered and quick with his guns and fists Liam Neeson is pretty tame here keeping his aggressions to a minimum until the very end of the movie. The experience earlier in the film, the shoot out in Washington Heights, that cost the life of a young girl pacified him, or Matt Scudder, so much that he seemed to have a death wish and in many cases almost welcomed the dangers he was confronted with! That by doing noting to prevent them from happening to him. It was in the end that Scudder got down to business in taking out Carrie's, as well as many others in the film, killers when his self preservation instincts, against his trying to lose them, suddenly kicked in!",A Walk Among the Tombstones
41,leonblackwood,Gripping thriller! 5/10,5,25 January 2015,"Review: This film starts off promising and then it slows right down when Liam Neeson puts his Miss Marple hat on. Neeson, who plays a city cop, kicks off the movie with a great shootout which changes his life and forces him to retire from the force. He then becomes a private investigator who takes on jobs for clients who don't want to use the law. Whilst sitting in a bar, he gets approached by a dodgy looking character, saying that his brother has got a job for him so he agrees to meet up with his brother and after much deliberation, he decides to take on the job to find the people who killed his wife. From there, Neeson tries to piece all his information together to try and find out what happened to his wife. I quite enjoyed the film but I'm too used to watching Neeson kicking butt. I liked the relationship between Neeson and the homeless boy, who wants to become a PI, but the whole pace of the film is quite slow. I was expecting some twists and turns, but it's basically about a couple of kidnappers who take drug dealers wife's and children for money. The shootout at the end wasn't bad but I was expecting more from the drug dealers who lost there loved ones. Anyway, it's worth a watch but it's not in the same class and some of Neeson recent work. Watchable!Round-Up: It amazes me how Neeson has become this action/thriller king in the latter part of his life but he still takes on projects like Lego Movie and A Million Ways To Die In The West. He's even been cast in the new Ted 2 so he's obviously enjoying doing the light hearted movies as well as the moody action roles. He was perfectly cast in this movie and his calm but forceful demeanor really worked. If the film would have carried on from the beginning, except for skipping to the future when he left the force, I think it would have been a hundred times better, but that's just my personal opinion. That's not to say that this movie is totally bad, but I just liked the brutal cop theme more than the private investigator one, especially with Neeson as the lead. Budget: $28million Worldwide Gross: $53millionI recommend this movie to people who are into their dramatic/crime/thrillers about a private investigator whose trying to find out who is kidnapping drug dealers wife's and children. 5/10",A Walk Among the Tombstones
42,imseeg,"One of the rare serious movies Liam Neeson made recently. It's nice to see more true to life acting, but the pace is a bit boring and the story is downbeat. Worth 1 watch.",6,2 April 2019,"This is one of the rare Liam Neeson movies that are meant to be taken seriously. It is about an ex cop who is investigating the kidnapping of wife and children of some gangster boss. Will he be able to rescue them or will he die trying?Simple story, yet this time around, there is NOT much action to be enjoyed. It is more of a slowburning detective story, with lots of investigations going on. Not nearly as flashy and exhilirating as all the other Liam Neeson action pictures. Come to think of it, this is NOT an action picture firstmost. Yes, there is some good action, yet it is rather grim and without the usual fun factor.The whole mood of this picture is somewhat downbeat. The storyline is cause of that, because it was based on a (downbeat) novel. For some reason they decided that Liam Neeson had to take care of a streetkid, while searching for the kidnappers. He is also batttling alcoholism during this story.These story sidelines are all being portrayed seriously and it's done reasonably convincing, yet somehow I got a bit down and bored sometimes watching it. It isnt a full blown drama either, so I just kept feeling that these more dramatic emotional side storylines about alcoholism and taking care of a streetkid were distracting from the suspense and pace of the action part of the movie.Worth only 1 watch, because I didnt like the downbeat mood of it. Liam Neeson though, is still being the typical Liam Neeson as we know him of all the other action movies, so watching him is still quite enjoyable!",A Walk Among the Tombstones
43,videorama-759-859391,"Take a walk on the dark side, with our resurrected Scudder, in Lawrence's Blockbusting novel to pic",7,15 October 2014,"I love watching Liam Neeson more and more in film. This is the second adaption of a Lawrence Block novel to film. Would you believe twenty eight years back, was the first adaption in Eight Million Ways To Die with Jeff Bridges. Both performances are frickin' poles apart, where I'm gonna go out on a limb, and say I preferred Bridges's take on the Matt Scudder character, but I liked watching Neeson do his thing too. Also, I preferred the sleazy over indulgence of the addictive 8 Million Ways film to this one, too, very different from the novel. This is a very tight plotted film and a strong thriller, but does give way to some weak moments of predictability, it's climax quite gripping, with a lead up to it, but it was kind of hazy as to seeing what ensued, like the widower ended up dead on the stairs in grisly fashion. I wanted to a see a much fitting justice on these repellent sick fu..in' arseholes, who we're supposed ex DEA agents, no one could give too hoots about. They get their kicks kidnapping women of drug users, and demanding ransoms while torturing and mutilating them, and sending them back in severed parts, while not keeping their end of the bargain by returning the loved ones. The latest happens to be a 14 year old year girl, would you believe. Like 8 Million Ways, in it's starting, here, it opens with an explosive shootout, in a bar, and ends up badly for notorious lush cop Scudder, where one stray bullet hits an innocent. Cut to 8 years later, now 1999, a drug kingpin, asks for Scudder's help, as being another widow, to a wife napping, ransom, and murder. He implores Scudder to catch these sick fu..ers and bring them to him. At first refusing the job, and the moolah comes with it, he quickly learns there's been other murders done in the same fashion, before, so he does what he does best, with a little help from a runaway black kid. Some quite grizzly violence in bits, and how violence has come a long way. I mean just check out 8 Million Ways To Die, that's tame compared to this, save for that trademark van, slashing scene, with Alexandra Paul. I did like this one too, as Scudder walks a different beat, where I think Neeson really did well, veering away, with how our other actor approached it, which of course would help, if Neeson hasn't watched 8 Million. The film has a very good script from a very grounded writer, and some very good, and imaginative performances, like the chief sicko, who I really wished got the crap smashed out of it, as if it was a personal mission from that widower, who has the most glaring and unforgiving eyes. The suicidal fat guy who made up the trio of sicko's was creepily good. What really sucked, honestly was the unsatisfying and almost unforgettable finale of Scudder and team against our sicko's. It would be interesting to see in future, if any more of Block's books become films. But stopping at two isn't so bad, if comparing both two films and it's performances, this one a few notches short of 8 Million. Less is more.",A Walk Among the Tombstones
44,jtindahouse,Never quite rises above mediocrity,7,16 January 2015,"At the ripe old age of 62, Liam Neeson's career has arguably never been in finer form. The man just keeps making great film after great film (we'll excuse 'A Million Ways to Die in the West' as he was purely there based on a 'Family Guy' joke). From the 'Taken' trilogy to the 'Dark Knight' trilogy through to stand-alone hits like 'Non-Stop' and now 'A Walk Among the Tombstones', producers and directors must be dying to work with him and fair enough too, the man is very watchable on film.This movie was lucky to have him in fact because truth be told the story is a little mundane. The set-up in the first 15 minutes was very promising, only for it all to fall into the trap of being your run of the mill action-thriller with a lot of talking, some cliché bad guys and even a side-kick (far and away the worst part of the film). Every scene Astro is in is just unwatchable and completely takes the audience away from the serious mood they're supposed to be watching the film in. Very disappointing piece of writing and casting that was. Dan Stevens on the other hand continues to blow me away. He was only in a supporting role this time around, but he was still very impressive in every scene he was in. I would still never have guessed he was British. His accents are always very convincing.'A Walk Among the Tombstones' is far from being a bad movie, in fact it's very well made in a lot of parts. But it never takes that next step needed to become something special and memorable. Neeson is more than capable of carrying a movie but filmmakers have to make sure they don't rely on him doing so. There are some pretty gritty and violent elements to the film so make sure you go in prepared for that. Overall a solid edition to Neeson's career but nothing that will be talked about down the road.",A Walk Among the Tombstones
45,billcr12,Gritty Liam,7,24 January 2015,"O.k. this is typical retired cop becomes private eye and is hired to find the bad guys. The saving grace is Liam Neeson in the lead role. It opens with Liam at a bar in New York City drinking his morning coffee with a couple of shots when the real action begins; lots of gunfire ensues with deadly results. We flash ahead to the detective taking a grisly case of women being abducted, tortured and killed. The script and story are very formula, with a street kid added for some lighter, almost father-son moments between Neeson and a young homeless boy. There is no explanation as to why the NYPD is not in pursuit of the evil doers, but even with this gaping plot hole, Liam Neeson is able to make A Walk Among the Tombstones worth watching.",A Walk Among the Tombstones
46,BeneCumb,Better than expected - and Neeson is still good,7,6 January 2015,"I have always liked Liam Neeson, but after 2x Taken and Non-Stop I became a bit ambivalent toward him - can he deliver something new in such movies, with plots not very different from each other. But, thanks to the decent plot (based on a decent book) and his versatile depiction of not- so-novel character, I did not feel bored or annoyed. True, his co-actors were not very imposing and the ending could have been less trivial, but I can give strong 7 points without any hesitation. Probably more, if I would have seen it before Taken.Nevertheless, despite the fact that Liam Neeson could easily become another Nicholas Cage, they are both actors with big A, watchable even in the event of weaker scripts, or plots with strong recurrence patterns.",A Walk Among the Tombstones
47,freemantle_uk,A serviceable crime thriller,7,2 October 2014,"Liam Neeson continues his long streak of stoic law enforcement roles who have demons in their past with the old fashioned detective story. Neeson stars as Matt Scudder, an ex-NYPD Detective who has become a unlicensed private detective and a recovering alcoholic who is hired by a drug trafficking (Dan Stevens) to find out who kidnapped and murdered his wife. As Matt investigates the crime he discovers this is not the first time the criminals struck and he needs to find them before they strike again.A Walk Among Tombstones is a grim and gritty crime thriller that should please fans of the genre. Writer/director Scott Frank brings a 70s style to the film, using grey filters and sets the film in the more run down areas of Brooklyn and Queens and shows really horrific crimes. The cast is strong and many of the characters are painted with shades of grey. Though Neeson is good he is hardly stretching himself.A Walk Among Tombstone is a well made thriller that is fearless with its portrayal of violence and as an investigation story. But this is material that could have easily worked on television and there are nitpicks like the film setting itself in 1999 when it could have been set in now and they is a weird moment when an upbeat pop song when the kidnappers see pick a victim when it could and should have been more sinister.",A Walk Among the Tombstones
48,stevendbeard,Retro Detective,7,19 September 2014,"I saw ""A Walk Among the Tombstones"", starring Liam Neeson-the Taken movies-with a third one in the works, The Dead Pool; Brian 'Astro' Bradley-Earth to Echo, The X Factor_tv; Maurice Compte-Sabotage, End of Watch and David Harbour-The Green Hornet, Quantum of Solace.This is like an older style detective story, with the style and feel of those old Phillip Marlow and Sam Spade stories of yesteryear-in fact those two detectives are even mentioned by a character in this film. This is based on a series of novels written by Lawrence Block about a detective named Matt Scudder and it takes place in the 1990's. Matt does not like cell phones or other modern technologies, such as computers; this is right before the Y2K threat that never came about but lots of people were convinced that it would destroy the world. This is also not the first time a movie has been made about the character, either. Jeff Bridges played Matt Scudder in the 1986 film, 8 Million Ways to Die. Liam plays Matt, a former cop turned unlicensed private investigator. And since he is unlicensed, he helps people that the police can not or will not help and he gets gifts instead of a fee-of course, sometimes a gift can be money, as long as it is considered a gift. Maurice is a drug kingpin that hires Liam because someone kidnapped his wife and then killed her, even after he paid the ransom. Maurice wants to deal with the kidnappers/killers himself and not involve the police with justice. Brian plays a young kid that Liam meets and befriends-Brian is computer savy. David plays one of the kidnappers that has a rather sadistic side. As I said earlier, the story is good but if you are looking for a lot of action, this is not as action-packed as the Taken movies. There is some action here but just not a lot. It's rated ""R"" for violence, language and nudity and has a running time of 1 hour & 53 minutes. I liked it enough to buy it on DVD.",A Walk Among the Tombstones
49,alindsay-al,An above average mystery,6,20 July 2015,"With the success of the first taken film it seems Liam neeson is going to be in an action film every year, but this film is completely different to any of the other action films he has been in recently. The premise of this film sees a private detective trying to solve a murder case. Now what I liked in this movie is that Liam neeson really shows off his acting ability in this film and he isn't just a copy and paste of Bryan mills from the taken franchise. His character is dark and gritty but also lost in his life and you can tell that this job is everything to him. His kid associate is pretty good in the movie even though he isn't really that important to the story. The bad guys were creepy and worked well for this movie even though there wasn't much to them. The story was pretty interesting with allot of mystery to it, but sometimes you wonder what is really going on and if this film could pick up its pace a little a bit. The script has some decent dramatic dialogue but too much in the film it feels like people are just saying names that you don't remember, the film could have also used a little bit of humour in it as well. The small amount of action scenes were done well it just seems like there isn't many at all and the pacing of this film is just overly slow and doesn't build up the suspense enough in my opinion. Overall this is an alright film that if you like mystery films could be worth a watch.",A Walk Among the Tombstones
50,estebangonzalez10,Liam Neeson in a much darker and stylish film than what we've seen him in,6,13 October 2014,"""I do favors for people and in return they give me gifts.""If you go into this film without having seen the trailers you might expect another action vehicle from Liam Neeson, but as soon as this gritty film begins you know you aren't getting your average revenge flick. This is a much darker and gloomy film where the atmosphere and tone take a primary seat in this procedural detective tale. The story is secondary because what really is at the core of this film directed by Scott Frank (The Lookout) is the style. Frank succeeds at setting the eerie and uncomfortable atmosphere of this stylish thriller which will remind audiences of some of Fincher's earlier films. The dark atmosphere will turn off some audiences who were expecting another fun action film because the downbeat tone won't please mainstream audiences. At times the film is much more reminiscent to Neeson's work in The Grey than what he has done lately, but despite the strong performance, the main character of A Walk Among the Tombstones is the city which has been manipulated by Frank to appear gloomy and dark. This is what Frank manages to do best with his film, unfortunately he fails with the story and some of the subplots involved. The pacing begins to drag and the movie feels overlong because despite the somber atmosphere there is not much going on story wise when all the secondary characters and subplots begin to overpopulate the film. Neeson does what it takes to elevate the material when things begin to feel out of place and manages to make this film worth while and engaging. It's too bad Frank wasn't able to trim the subplots down a bit because he had a much better and promising film somewhere along the way. Tombstones does succeed in making the audience feel uncomfortable and it will make most feel a bit undecided as to how they feel about it long after it has ended. I find myself in- between, giving it a positive grade but not as entirely satisfied as I could have been after a promising opening sequence. I tend to enjoy Liam Neeson in all of his films so I really don't complain when I go see one of his mind numbing action flicks like Taken because I have a good time with it. In Tombstones he truly shows he has what it takes to undertake stronger and more complex roles. Neeson gives a solid performance once again and the film is worth checking out just for him. Despite being a very different film from his latest action films he does get a scene on the phone once again. No one knows how to threaten people over the phone like Neeson so of course producers couldn't miss the opportunity to have him do it. I don't get tired of it either. The rest of the characters in this film are forgettable considering it centers on Neeson's lonely character in the midst of a corrupted and dark New York City. Having the film set in 1999 along with the downbeat atmosphere constantly reminds the viewer of what is going to happen in the near future. We get a very ugly glimpse of humanity and that is where Frank succeeds because the film never tries to glamorize murders like so many modern films try to do. It doesn't even worry about explaining their motivations, it simply presents this dark atmosphere where there are no other interesting characters than Liam Neeson. The greatest failure of the film is the inclusion of a homeless kid who helps Neeson, but this subplot completely misfires and only makes the film feel more disconnected. Other than those few issues I had with Tombstones I think it is a strong adaptation of one of Lawrence Block's Matt Scudder novels. It gets a lot of credit for being able to create such a dark atmosphere.",A Walk Among the Tombstones

Liam Neeson plays his usual self, except this time all his extraneous family-members-in-danger baggage is stripped away. This puts the audience more at ease, because a finger here and a finger there isn't going to affect the concert pianist future of anyone about whom Neeson's Matt character gives even one hoot.

53,kirbylee70-599-526179,The gritty detective lives,7,21 March 2016,"The detective story has been a staple of movies for years. Everything from the deductive reasoning of Sherlock Holmes to the down and dirty Phillip Marlowe have been on display, making the private detective a character that can be either slick or down and dirty. Author Lawrence Block has made a career of writing about one detective in particular, Matthew Scudder. While the character has been around since 1976, only one movie has been made featuring him, 8 MILLION WAYS TO DIE. That is until the release this last year of A WALK AMONG THE TOMBSTONES which has just arrived on DVD.Liam Neeson plays the title character, a police detective when the film begins in 1991 and then a private detective 8 years later shortly thereafter. Scudder is a recovering alcoholic due to scenes we witness in the opening. Peter (Boyd Holbrook), a fellow addict who met Scudder at an AA meeting, shows up one day and asks for his help for his brother Ken (Dan Stevens). Scudder reluctantly agrees.It turns out that Ken is a high end drug dealer whose wife was kidnapped. When Scudder tells him he doesn't handle kidnapping cases Ken informs him that he's already paid the ransom and that the kidnappers returned his wife in pieces. He wants Scudder to help him find the kidnappers/murderers.While looking into the case Scudder discovers there have been more cases of victims cut into pieces and dumped around town. As he researches the information at the library he meets T.J. (Astro), a young homeless boy. The pair gradually help one another as T.J. helps Scudder navigate the library's computer. In return Scudder pays T.J. Eventually this becomes a situation where they pair help one another as the film progresses.Using clues to track down information about the past murders Scudder comes to realize that they have all been connected. Each of the victims was tied to a drug dealer in one form or another. This prevented those the ransom was demanded of from contacting the police. With each piece of information Scudder gathers the closer he gets to the kidnappers/murderers. But will he turn them over to those whose loved ones were kidnapped knowing full well they'll seek their revenge or will he contact the police? While these are the basics of the story found in this movie it's more about the journey taken by Scudder that is the heart of the film. Scudder has been a rudderless person when we see him in 1999. He lives but isn't alive. The combination of helping the families of the victims and his own helping of T.J. bring him back to the real world, one he gets involved in rather than merely walks through.The movie and the performances reflect the gritty streets that exists as opposed to the glamorous cityscapes seen in most detective movies these days. Scudder is no slick hustler with a quick $20 in his pocket dealt out to tons of connections. He is instead a diligent investigator who claims it's more about luck while delving into the problem at hand. The world he walks in is drab and dirty, more grays, brown and blacks for a color palette than the bright neon's we're used to seeing. This is the truth of what the occupation offers instead of the glitz most movies offer. In the end it helps rather than hurts the film.Neeson does a fine job here, never yelling or doing the acrobatic styles of fighting most films, including his own TAKEN series, offer. He remains calm in most situations and doesn't carry a gun. When he does arm himself it's the last thing he does. There is even a section of the film where he warns T.J. about the dangers of walking around armed. With Neeson's recent comments on guns in America he still has no problem walking around shooting people when the character calls for it. But the fact is this is a movie and he's entitled to his opinion. The movie hearkens back to some of the detective films of the seventies rather than the typical gumshoe of the thirties and forties. Streets are dirty, killers are despicable and drug dealers live in nice houses but not mansions. As with those films it is the diligence on display by the detective that helps him find the bad guy. In a world overrun with numerous car chases and enough arms to supply a small army it's nice to see a return to this kind of detective. Here's hoping we see more of Matt Scudder.",A Walk Among the Tombstones
54,NateWatchesCoolMovies,Nicely nasty little potboiler,8,8 August 2015,"Scott Frank's A Walk Among The Tombstones is a decidedly nasty, moody and utterly somber thriller starring a grizzled, world weary Liam Neeson. Forget Taken. This one drops the Bourne esque theatrics for a more mature, morose take on Neeson's newfound tough guy mantra. He plays ex cop Matt Scudder, disgraced after an unfortunate incident, which we get to see in a breathless, harrowing prologue. Years layer he's a low profile Private Investigator. When a local drug kingpin (Dan Stevens doing his scary eyes routine excellently) hires him to locate his missing wife and bring her back, he uncovers a sordid kidnapping/murder ring run by two detestable psychopathic monsters (David Harbour and Adam Thompson). These two are the sickest villains I've seen in a few years, just horrible, evil people. Neeson does well in this stone cold potboiler that takes its time turning up the suspense meter, but eventually gets to some really squirmy places that'll have you uncomfortable. It has a nostalgic 90's vibe as well, a bare bones, character based aesthetic that's refreshing these days. It's a freaky affair though, so bring along a strong stomach. But it's a bag of bone chilling fun, with a climax that feels a bit rushed and generic, but the film as a whole more than makes up for that.",A Walk Among the Tombstones
55,3xHCCH,Neeson's Old-Fashioned Noir,7,20 September 2014,"The book series by Lawrence Block upon which the lead character Matt Scudder was derived began in 1976. This film is based on the 10th book of the series with the same name, published in 1992. An ex-cop haunted by guilt, Matt Scudder now operates as an ""unlicensed"" private detective. One day in 1999, he was hired by a certain Kenny Kristo to track down two men who kidnapped and killed his wife Carrie. Scudder gets himself caught in a dark web of drug traffickers, psychotic serial killers and lonely denizens in the underbelly of New York City.Lately, Liam Neeson is more known for his high-adrenaline action films like ""Taken"" and ""Taken 2"". He takes a departure from that type of hi- octane explosive vehicle to take on a more calculated, old-fashioned film noir in this one. Nevertheless, Neeson plays a character who is no less bad-ass and gung-ho, very much an action hero. He certainly portrayed this role so credibly and charismatically.Aside from Neeson, there were some supporting characters that will capture your sympathy. There was James Loogan, the cemetery caretaker who loved pigeons, played so creepily well by Olafur Darri Olafsson. There was Howie, the addict who wants to but can't quit his drug habit, disarmingly played by Eric Nelsen. And finally, there was TJ, an orphan who idolizes the likes of Spade and Marlowe, played with sensitivity and heart by Brian ""Astro"" Bradley.The storytelling by writer/director Scott Frank is very laid back and even contemplative in pace, with beautiful artistic cinematography by Mihai Malaimare Jr. This may disorient and even disappoint those fans who expected another ""Taken"" retread. You get the same chilling vibe as other grisly crime thrillers like ""Se7en"" or ""Zodiac,"" though this one would be less intellectual than those.",A Walk Among the Tombstones

This time around he's a disgraced former alcoholic NY cop (are they any other kind in movies?) who since he's a private investigator now is asked to investigate the disappearance of a woman. Of course he can't accept, the husband is a drug trafficker and all movie heroes have to be disagreeable and reluctant. Later he accepts. Is there an app to generate generic scripts yet? Turns out the woman was kidnapped; the husband paid the ransom after offering a lower price and then is sent all over town until he finds the wife in the trunk of a car...chopped to pieces.Liam has no trouble in suddenly finding countless witnesses who all saw two guys in a van.

Two other women have been killed in the same way, one DEA agent and the girl of another drug dealer, with pieces strewn all over the place including the lake in a cemetery. Liam interviews the grounds keeper who acts suspicious and Liam decides to follow him. Indeed, this guy has worked with the killers and has some info on them. After he reveals some of it, he jumps off a building as we saw in the revealing preview. Previews tend to be long and far too revealing these days.When the daughter of yet another drug dealer is taken, Liam communicates directly with these guys and sets the terms of the exchange to make sure this time around they don't kill the girl. The exchange takes place, a shootout ensues, and then the resolution in the house of the bad guys.A Walk Among the Tombstones takes place in the 90s and it has a 90s feel to it. It even has the obligatory black kid sidekick. He's homeless, Internet savvy, understands German, is a vegetarian and doesn't drink soft drinks. The movie slows down noticeably when this character is introduced. It's two hours long, about half an hour too long, time that could easily been edited out had the side story with the sidekick been cut. A Walk Among the Tombstones doesn't tell us much about the main character, it doesn't tell us much about the villains. It just lets the story play out slowly. At first it manages to build up some excitement but it doesn't manage to maintain it although things pick up again near the end.

Also it's not that I don't like Neeson. He's certainly not an actor who plays memorable roles, but the fact is that he embodies roles like this in a proper manner. Just as in ""Non-Stop"", he takes the identity of a former alcoholic who turned his back to his career as a police officer and exchanged it for a more low-profile profession. Again, he got stuck with an immense guilt because of a blunder he made due to his alcohol problem.That's also the introduction of ""A Walk Among the Tombstones"": the situation in which Matt Scudder (Liam Neeson) finds himself and making that famous mistake. The mistake itself isn't immediately revealed but will be later on in the film. Let's say it's in such a way significant, that Scudder throws his police badge in the garbage can, immediately decides to sober up and tamely attends AA meetings on a regular base. And finally he continues as a private detective without a license. One day he's being accosted by a member of the AA, asking him to help his brother (a drug dealer) in a case where the police shouldn't be involved in. Turns out his wife was kidnapped and that he already paid the asked ransom. Instead of closing his wife back in his arms, she's neatly delivered as a bunch of packets lying in the trunk of a car. A butcher would be jealous of such craftsmanship. The moment another drug dealer's daughter is kidnapped, Scudder takes the responsibility to track the sadistic and insane killers.It's not very original but still entertaining enough. There was even a slight form of tension in this dark thriller. Unfortunately again, the character Scudder is a stereotypical person. A traumatized loner who seems to be indifferent because of his personal suffering in the past and the resulting blunder. A cynical person with a ""Je mon fou"" attitude. Eventually it doesn't bother him how he returns from a confrontation, although he still came to a soberly conclusion at some point: ""I'm getting too old for this"". His alcohol problem is a crucial element in Scudder's life, and is plainly demonstrated by interweaving flashbacks and the twelve steps of AA in it (although the time that this happened was a poor choice). The announcement of him being 8 years sober at an AA meeting, was followed by a rather cool reaction. I still think those members could muster some enthusiasm. This wasn't exactly encouraging.The 62-year-old Neeson plays the role as the repented ex-cop, purely with one's eyes shut. The color palette used in this movie, gave it a 70s feeling and eventually made an old-fashioned police thriller out of it. And Neeson fits in this set-up perfectly as a matured detective. But the most imaginative characters were the two creepy, sadistic serial killers played by David Harbour (as Ray) and Adam David Thompson (as Albert). Indeed, they are a kind of ""Bert and Ernie"". Only they don't do such innocent things like cramming a banana in someone's ear. They are two insensible and self-assured characters, who won't hesitate to torture an innocent teenage girl.""A Walk Among the Tombstones"" certainly wasn't a bad film, but ultimately left me indifferent. The final denouement wasn't exactly surprising and at the end of the movie I only had a ""That's it ?"" feeling. It was also a bit silly to involve the street boy TJ in it. Eventually, his contribution to the entire story wasn't of great importance and probably was only used so Scudder could show his protective fatherly feelings. There was however one particular part that disappointed me the most and that's the basement of the two buddies Ray and Albert. Even the basement of my father looks more eerie than this dark cave of those two sadistic creeps. They made sure that even the most sensitive soul could watch this film. How Albert managed to free himself, was actually a mystery to me. For me this part could have been explicitly portrayed. However, the final was straightforward and cold-blooded. Sadly enough this was the only moment where I briefly raised my eyebrows. Shocker.More reviews here : http://opinion-as-a-moviefreak.blogspot.be",A Walk Among the Tombstones

59,jadepietro,Walking in Circles,6,22 September 2014,"￼ This film is mildly recommended.  That accomplished Irish actor, Liam Neeson, sidestepped a distinguished  Broadway stage career (Anna Christie, The Judas Kiss, The Crucible) for  the allure of the big screen. After successful roles in diverse films  like Nell, Rob Roy, Michael Collins, Star Wars Episode 1: The Phantom  Menace, Kinsey, and his peak performance in Schindler's List, he found  his niche as an action hero, a sort of everyday common man facing one  crisis after the next, just bordering on, but not quite, the superhero.  Most moviegoers seem to enjoy this screen persona and his recent acting  choices in these conventional thrillers. A Walk Among the Tombstones is  another one of these exercises in the action genre with mostly  entertaining results.  ￼Neeson plays Matt Scudder, a disgraced ex-cop and now P.I. who is  hired by a drug dealer (Dan Stevens, taking a giant leap from his  Matthew Crawley character from Downton Abbey) to find his wife's killer  and exact revenge. Along the way, our solemn hero runs into many  unsavory characters, violent encounters, and gruesome murders. His  investigation also lead him to a runaway sidekick named T.J. (Brian  ""Astro"" Bradley) who idolizes the detective genre and talks of Sam  Spade and Phillip Marlowe. As moviegoers, we are suppose to connect  that association with our modern crusader, but there's really no  parallel in comparison. Their relationship seems forced and lacks  credibility. Their sparing is only there as a plot device to move the  action along.  ￼A Walk Among the Tombstones holds one's interest, especially in its  first hour, as Scudder tries to unravel the killings and the motives  for the crimes, but midway, the guilty parties are revealed and the  gripping mystery never picks up the pace from there. Instead, the film  becomes just another predictable and somewhat dull crime thriller with  murder and mayhem overtaking the plot. There are moments of real  suspense due to the solid direction by Scott Frank, but his screenplay  has some leaps of logic throughout the film. Also, unexplained events  during the climactic showdown never quite fall into place. One expects  some twists or sudden revelation, but it's all routine procedure and  not completely satisfying.  Neeson is effective and bring much authority to his role. Adam David  Thompson and especially David Harbour are eerily believable as menacing  and crazed villains. Ólafur Darri Ólafsson and Eric Nelsen offer strong  support in smaller roles.  A Walk Among the Tombstones is a grim tale of murder and violence that  rambles to its ultimate conclusion when it should strive for more.  GRADE: B-",A Walk Among the Tombstones
60,Seraphion,Quite a deep story with Liam Neeson's detective work,7,25 September 2014,"Quitting the police force eight years ago, Matt Scodder is now a private investigator. Through a junkie Peter he receives a case of the murder of a drug dealer Kenny's wife Carrie. She was murdered and mutilated even after Kenny payed the ransom. His probing leads to some info; kidnapping into a van by multiple men. Searching for recent similar cases in the library, Matt befriends a kid T.J. They found two previous cases; of Marie and Leila. Matt visits a cemetery keeper Jonas who first found Leila's body parts, then to Leila's ex Reuben. Matt figures out the linked motive that the women had ties with drug dealers; which in Leila's case was Reuben. Visiting a rooftop Jonas went to earlier, Matt is confronted by Jonas. Jonas admits his role in Leila's case then kills himself. Matt continues his investigation, confirming his theory after finding that Marie was a cop who also deals drugs. During that time, T.J. sometimes follows him trying to help on detective work. The kidnappers Ray and Albert had already found their next target, the daughter of another drug dealer Yuri, Lucia. One rainy night, T.J. gets beaten up and contracts anemia. Matt visits him and answers T.J. the reason he quit the force; his bullet in the opening scene ricocheted and killed a little girl. Ray and Albert kidnaps Lucia, and Peter brings Matt to Yuri. Matt tackle the dealing with the kidnappers. Matt, Yuri, Kenny and Peter run their plan. Using counterfeit money, Matt goes to the exchange place at a cemetery at night, having Peter covering him with a rifle, among the tombstones. After the exchange, Albert notices the fake money but Matt shoot Ray in the chest. Albert shoots frantically, killing Peter. Ray still lives due to wearing a Kevlar vest, but Matt clips his side, wounding him. Albert takes him away with their van. Matt and Keny realized that T.J., who's supposed to stay put in the car, has gone missing. He already sneaked into Ray and Albert's van. Matt and Kenny gets the address from him and they get there. Matt leaves Kenny with the cuffed Albert, who has killed Ray, and goes sending T.J. away. H goes back inside and finds Kenny dead. Albert almost had him but he fights back. He tases Albert with Ray's taser and then kills him.The movie opens up both strongly and contrastingly, showing the tense shootout scene back to back with the mysterious crying girl scene. The story then continues to build up without anymore nonsense, changing the genre feel to the mystery-crime of the usual detective work movies. The deviation into the Leila case at first seems weird, but then it gets back on track with the flash-backs and motive link. The crime aura is felt constantly wherever Matt goes, with the exception of some scenes, particularly with T.J.Frankly I'd say that there's not much that this movie offer besides the quite deep story and Liam Neeson's We have even seen him with this kind of role earlier this year in Non-Stop (2014). But I, and maybe as well as many others who put this movie at the second spot of last week's Box Office, think that those are enough for us. The story is deep enough and was able to incite enough curiosity to keep watching.The acting is good, and honestly it's quite a surprise for me. Without any other equally well-known talent name to give him a balancing performance, Liam Neeson managed to understand that the focus will be on him almost entirely, and he delivered a fine acting here. After his eye- catching appearance on the 2011 X Factor talent show, Brian Bradley a.k.a Astro hits his second acting work after Earth to Echo (2014) a few months back. Seeing how he handled himself, transforming from the cocky X Factor Astro to the proud yet insecure T.J. makes his acting worth mentioning. The other actors are less known names yet they're widely experienced thus able to give their roles some character.A 7 out of 10 score is very worth it for this movie from me. A recommendation is a definite from me. Liam Neeson's ruthless calm acting can always be counted on indeed.",A Walk Among the Tombstones
61,RatedVforVinny,"Grim, bleak but rather good.",8,10 February 2020,"This was a suitably gloomy, outing for Liam Neeson but in places it's an intense and rather exciting thriller. He plays a 'Private Dick' (an ex cop), who has a typical black past and is now helping anyone who can afford his services. Still retaining a type of code of honour, he gets assigned to a case of two very nasty individuals, who are kidnapping young women and sexually assaulting them, before cutting them into pieces. It's a better film than 'Taken' so deserves some attention and a much higher rating.",A Walk Among the Tombstones
62,rgkarim,"A Walk Among the Mystery, but lacking in some thrills",7,21 September 2014,"Liam Neeson, astute gentleman, legendary Jedi, and assassin who can hunt anyone down who takes his family. Yet Hollywood seems to focus on the latter, not deviating from the stoic man who can rip armies of murderers asunder and come out swinging. This weekend, yet another story is told about our leading action actor, entitled A Walk Among The Tombstones. Seeing the trailers earlier this summer, I got chills at the darkness and mystery the tale promised. If you know me by now though, there is always the skepticism of being let down by the actual film. What does this movie have in store? Read on to uncover the details. We know that Liam Neeson can act the part of the sullen, rogue agent who defies all the rules and limits other cops seem to have. Once again, he is back still able to bring the smolder filled face of justice to the dark underbelly of whatever setting he's in. This film though goes one stop further down the dark hole, having Neeson dive into the darker pits of his soul to face the internal and external demons. He pulls it off flawlessly, almost as if he faces the very challenges in real life. Helping to support Mr. Neeson, is a variety of people, though we will only focus on a few others to spare room for other aspects. Providing comedic relief, and an outlet from his character's darkness is Astro, who has had a growth spurt since Echo. Astro has got a mouth, and thinks he is tough kid who knows the way of the world, yet gets a lesson about just how little he knows. He's funny, he's cocky, and Astro pulls off the immature role to the letter. Yet it's the two killers of Ray (David Harbour) and Albert (Adam David Thompson) who really mix well with Liam. Harbour's ability to play the insane serial killer is quite well executed in his delivery of threats and the tone of his voice. As for Thompson, he captures the menacing glare down pat, and knows some stage combat, but aside from that not much in store. I'm sure you're saying though, I don't really care about the acting. How is the story? Well in a one word summary it is dark. It is also one of the more disturbing plots I've seen, that didn't cross into the soul destroying area. A Walk Among the Tombstones brings tension to the audience throughout the entire film in the hunting of the two disturbed beings. The hunt is in the form of heavy detective work involving talking to suspects, retracing footsteps and trying to piece information together. For once, the mystery has a bit of realism to it, forgoing the convenient pieces of information, for a process that involves actually working for clues. As the movie progresses, the ambiguous nature and seemingly simple motive starts to reveal itself. With each new clue, the mentality of the perpetrators becomes clearer, almost like one is watching an episode of Criminal Minds. Yet the unstable psyche and constant calls of the psychos continue to reestablish the terror of what will happen next. Sure, you have a good idea of what the outcomes will be, but there is just enough uncertainty to have you doubting your thoughts. Mixed into the bag is some character development amongst the various players in the game, each with their own set of dark secrets that explains why they are scarred for life. Some of these points are relevant, but the mistake here is that they are played over and over again as they build up to the revelation, one of which you already know from the trailers. Other plot elements though are not so relevant or as big as they thought. Some hasty connections were an attempt to add another layer of depth to the story, but I felt the audience could have done without them. Still it gives the cast a little more depth, and provides some emotional depth to an otherwise monotone cast. Perhaps the strongest element of the character development though is the inspiration they have. Albeit a little cheesy in the presentation, there is a good message to those who may have a similar history as Neeson's character. The emphasis of facing your demons instead of running from them is a lesson many could use a refresher course in. Yet the message is drawn out, much like the background, and sometimes adds unneeded length to the movie. As for the suspense of the movie, as mentioned I before it is the psychotic mindset of the killers that keeps you in suspense. The only problem with this though is that, with the exception of the last part of the movie, the damage has already been done. Unfortunately for the cast, many of the crimes have already been committed, which dulls the intensity of their acts and makes the film a little boring at first. On the opposite side of spectrum, is that some of the actions are a little too well done, especially at times of torture. As stoic as I am against the usual antics, this movie crossed the line a couple of times to really disturb me. Thus, if you are one who gets REALLY AFFECTED BY SCENES OF SUFFERING should turn a blind eye to this film, or at least until they become a little tolerant. A Walk Among the Tombstones is a nice crime/drama to bide your time with. Those looking for a little pre-Halloween terror will get your fill with this movie, though in truth there are not a lot of technological aspects that make it theater worthy. Still if you are Liam Neeson fan, jump into this crime drama and be ready for a calmer film than his legendary Taken film. My scores for this film are: Action/Crime/Mystery: 7.0 Movie Overall: 7.0",A Walk Among the Tombstones
63,burlesonjesse5,VIEWS ON FILM review of A Walk Among the Tombstones,7,9 October 2014,"In Liam Neeson's latest endeavor A Walk Among the Tombstones, he does in fact do a lot of walking. He walks along sidewalks, past street corners, through graveyards (I'm thinking that's how the film got its title), and up on rooftops. He still gives you a daily dose of badassery, Neeson style. But this time it's not about the action, it's more about the emoting or fleshing out of his character. Don't worry, it's still his type of movie. He has a special set of skills, we know this. And you still get the obligatory phone call in which he tells off the villains kidnapping his friend, or his daughter, or his acquaintance, or whatever. Oh and by the way, he will find you, he will kill you, and so on and so on. Yeah, it's time to get Neesoned again and now, it's planned out in a sort of conventional, routine way.Directed by the guy that wrote 1998's critically acclaimed Out of Sight and featuring a couple of psychopaths cutting off a woman's breast and amputating two fingers from a 14 year old (to get a certain amount of ransom money, oy vey), A Walk Among the Tombstones is a warped character study involving a retired cop in Matthew Scudder (Neeson). The film takes place circa 1991 and then fast forwards to fall of 1999, the Y2K era. Scudder is a private investigator who no longer works for any law enforcement. He's out on his own, doing quote unquote ""favors"" for people who need their loved ones found and their enemies brought to justice. Scudder's assignment: to find the killers of a drug dealer's wife (newcomer Dan Stevens plays the half-rich trafficker) who demanded $400,000 all the while eventually killing said wife.Despite harnessing a hard R rating, ""Tombstone"" has a sick and twisted side without being as grotesque as most critics have led you to believe. Most of the torture scenes are masked. You think about them but you're spared the sight of the debauchery. That's a good thing because director Scott Frank is more geared toward being a mild film noir storyteller than anything else. His screenplay is deft and intelligent and although he exhibits some noir tendencies, he avoids filming anything in black and white (that makes sense because ""Tombstone"" wouldn't work as a 1940's/50's relic).Now if you haven't seen A Walk Among the Tombstones yet, know that you're going to be taken back by its mild nostalgia. The opening credits have an old school feel about them, like a font from the 1970's or 80's. Then there's the film score that although written by Carlos Rafael Rivera, feels like something the late Michael Small would have thought up when he wrote the music to The Parallax View and Marathon Man. You also get to see its star the way you see other actors become human while taking a beating like a normal, vulnerable person. Remember when Clint Eastwood took a break from being Dirty Harry to be a mountaineer in The Eiger Sanction? Or when Harrison Ford donned his butt-kicking persona in Raiders of the Lost Ark to getting pushed around in Blade Runner? If you're a fan of Neeson's indestructible menace in Taken, you might view ""Tombstone"" and think ""bummer"". I say phooey! This is Liam emoting more so than breaking some paper villain's neck. It's him doing the Philip Marlowe thing, the Law and Order thing, the you know, detective thing. It's refreshing and it rises above the stale, sort of clichéd material (another anti-hero, ex-cop who used to drink and has past demons) that ""Tombstone"" abbreviates for a majority of its running time.Of note: I dug the spot-on, clean cut direction of ""Tombstone"" by Floridian Frank. And as much as I worship my favorite Irish actor, I couldn't get over the missteps in his stance as a independent, non- affiliated private investigator. Within the film's conclusion (spoiler alerts), he kills a bunch of bad guys, leaves a bloody mess, and doesn't get questioned by real cops with badges. He eludes them, gets on a subway, and goes to his apartment as if nothing ever happened. Whatever. And what's with him using a twelve-step program as a mindset to infiltrate the maimed killers? The familiar or better yet similar concept worked in Frank's The Lookout (you know, the phrase, ""whoever has the money, has the power!""). Here, it just feels out of place and juvenile by comparison.All in all, despite silent flashbacks that somewhat deflate any dramatic tension, a couple of irrelevant side plots involving alcoholism, and the slight befriending of a homeless kid by the protagonist, I'm gonna recommend this thing strictly because of the ripe, 62 year-old Neeson. As long as he stays away from comedy, I feel that his performances in action/crime dramas are as reliable as daylight savings time and as comfortable as a pair of worn out loafers. If you wanna see another Taken, you won't get that here. You'll have to wait for the third one which is coming out in January of 2015. In regards to his current release, A Walk Among the Tombstones, it's not going to blow you away or change your view of sadistic, gloom and doom crime thrillers. It is however, a form of normalcy when it comes to your everyday genre conventions. What we have here is for the most part, a solid ""walk"" to remember.",A Walk Among the Tombstones

This unfolds more slowly and methodically, tightening the screws gradually until the tension is almost unbearable.Also, the killers targeting criminals' families was an unusual twist.

66,brando647,"A Decent Thriller, Neeson is Great w/Film Noir Vibe",7,5 September 2015,"I had zero interest in A WALK AMONG THE TOMBSTONES when it was released. I never cared for the idea of Liam Neeson as an action star and tend to avoid movies where he's an action lead (no, I've never seen TAKENbring on the hate). I got the impression this was just another of them and paid it little attention until I happened to read some of the reviews. I was excited to find this was more of a film noir/mystery than the run-and-gun action I'd expected. It's based on one of a series of novels written by Lawrence Block that I'm unfamiliar with. Liam Neeson is Matt Scudder, a retired police detective and recovered alcoholic who now makes a living as a private investigator. Scudder is approached by a fellow Alcoholics Anonymous regular who hopes he might be able to help his brother. Hesitant at first, Scudder's instincts prove accurate when he discovers the brother is a wealthy drug smuggler. The man's wife was taken for ransom and murdered, and he wants Scudder to find those responsible. Scudder's uninterested until he discovers a pattern of previous missing persons and murders that fit the same description. Soon Scudder finds himself diving deeper into a criminal underworld in search of a serial killer (killers?) who target rich lowlifes and slaughter their loved ones in gruesome fashion. What follows is a tense, occasionally exciting, investigation that ultimately fails to bring any real surprises but works because of Neeson and usual power performance.I found it interesting that A WALK AMONG THE TOMBSTONES was set in 1999 and it was intent on making sure we never forgot it. Constant hints and mentions of Y2K serve to remind us whenever it can. I suppose it's so the audience doesn't start to question why Scudder and his associates in the film don't use more reliable modern tech. Still, it gives the film a weird, otherworldly period vibe. A lot of dark earthy tones, very few bright colors anywhere to be seen, late model cars and giant phones. The visual design is probably what I enjoyed most about it; A WALK AMONG THE TOMBSTONES is great to look at. The story is all right but, in the end, it's not all that special. Its only unique element would be the fact that it's a familiar serial killer tale in which the victims are criminals (or criminally associated) themselves. Of course a criminal can't exactly go to the cops. Enter Matt Scudder. Scudder is an interesting character. The movie opens with a seemingly unrelated sequence that finds him chasing some thugs through Boston streets in an open firefight and I loved watching it unfold later in the film as an important moment in Scudder's career and some back story to explain why he became the man he is in the film. We get a hint at the complexity behind the character and, while this movie didn't blow me away, I'd be open to seeing further Scudder films.I enjoyed A WALK AMONG THE TOMBSTONES but I'll admit there's nothing exceptional about it. It fades from memory pretty fast once it's over. The film's cast doesn't have much in the way of standout performances. Neeson, as I said, is excellent because he rarely isn't. He's adopts an unofficial sort of young ward/sidekick in the form a homeless boy who latches on to him, excited at the chance of being a private detective. TJ (Brian 'Astro' Bradley) is a nice foil for Scudder: young and streetwise to counter his older, stoic personality. Dan Stevens, Ólafur Darri Ólafsson, and David Habour aren't bad. Just about everyone else leaves no lasting impression. It all comes down to the film basically being a Neeson showcase with an excellent noir- ish atmosphere. It's a decent little thriller but nothing to get excited about. Really, A WALK AMONG THE TOMBSTONES would make a good rental or cable viewing but I doubt it'll show up on many top 10 of 2014 lists.",A Walk Among the Tombstones
67,bob-rutzel-1,"Slow Moving, but Enjoyable",7,14 January 2015,"Former NYC Detective - now a P.I. - Matt Scudder ( Liam Neeson) helps Kenny Kristo (Dan Stevens) a drug dealer whose wife is missing. Scudder believes the woman is already dead, but takes the case anyway when he learns that the two bad guys kidnap women and hack them up while asking for money. Oh, there is a rumor that these bad guys are DEA informants. See, it gets complicated. If you are looking to see something along the lines of Taken, Taken 2 and Taken 3 you will be disappointed. Scudder does say ""when I find you, I will kill you."" And you think here we go but we really don't. Scudder has all the skills like his Taken character, but is more subdued. Well, until the ending anyway, and then it's not an easy row to hoe.No, here you will become a detective, sort of, along with Scudder. He and you will do it by good old-fashioned police work. He even walks (you remain on the couch) everywhere like a gumshoe (hope you know what that means). A homeless young boy TJ (Brian Bradley) attaches himself to Scudder. TJ has good drawing illustration skills, wants to become a detective like Scudder and he wants to help solve the case. This is not as intense as it could have been. In the beginning we see a woman (Kenny's wife) fearing for her life as she is tied up and abused; and the scenes could have given an impression of something erotic, but that is not the case. Those scenes were the most intense. The movie is slow moving to remind some of us (maybe) of the Philip Marlowe and Sam Spade stories and these two crime fighters are prominently mentioned in here. Slow moving, but enjoyable. Good acting all around and here Liam Neeson - as Scudder - is acting more like a detective and not an Action-Hero. (7/10)Violence: Yes.

69,Troy_Campbell,Above-average crime drama that deserves a big screen viewing.,7,22 October 2014,"Don't be fooled by the publicity – this is not another Taken or Non-Stop where Liam Neeson goes around taking names and kicking arse. Well, there is a small amount of that here too, but where those other flicks revel in their bloodthirsty beat downs for action thrills, AWATT utilises it sparingly for impact in what is otherwise a serious drama. Exploring themes such as guilt, redemption and moral corruption, writer-director Scott Frank nails the perfect tone where the ludicrousness of Neeson's badass-ness is not lost to overwrought melodrama, yet where the heft of the subject matter is not underplayed. If only Frank could've tightened up the actual narrative – involving Neeson's grizzled ex-cop tracking down two psychopathic murderers for a pair of drug dealers – and this movie would have tipped over into four star territory, rather than just nudging it. It's also a shame that the best scene is the brilliantly atmospheric and gut- punching opening sequence, a combination of style, sound and tension that is never quite reached again, despite a solid penultimate climax featuring a well-staged shoot out. It may not completely light the world on fire, but this is an elevated crime drama that warrants a big screen viewing nevertheless.",A Walk Among the Tombstones
70,antoniotierno,More than a revenge flick AND boosted by Neeson's performance,7,24 September 2014,"A Walk Among the Tombstones is slow-burn and fast-paced at the same time, though there are a few action scenes punctuating long periods of simmering tension. It's a story you appreciate for audacity, skill with Scudder seeming like a clone of Bryan Mills (his character in Taken), the real similarities being that they look alike and neither is averse to using violence to achieve his aims. I think Frank's willingness to go dark and stay there is one of the movie's strengths, acting like a warrior facing death and not caring if it takes him. A Walk Among the Tombstones acknowledges the darkest aspects of the human condition, a tough movie, though the plot ends up being very unlikely with the police and the FBI being not interested in the murders. Well described the relationship between the lead actor and the young boy.",A Walk Among the Tombstones

Neeson plays a tough detective, and undoubtedly delivers with brilliance. The cast is full of strong performers, due to which the level of intensity feels much, much higher.The story might not be the first of its kind, but it's the screenplay and execution that hits the target. One could call it an exploitative film due to its mature nature but then it's an adaptation of a novel of the same name, and while I haven't read it, I feel it's possibly a brutal and honest adaptation.And while it's slower and more dramatic as compared to Neeson's most action films, Tombstones makes up for most of it in the form of well choreographed action scenes it delivers at the right time and in the right amount. In short, it's a strongly written, tension filled neo-noir action thriller that deserves to be seen, if you aren't easily disturbed or turned off by the frequently graphic violence and language.",A Walk Among the Tombstones

There are parts with predictable events and talk. Had this mystery been filled with something more rare and extraordinary it could be rate 10 stars. But good parts are good actors, good scenes which look very real, like they are not fake, and good motivation for detectives and anybody who likes mysteries. Motivation is something negative in this case, like lack of loved ones, but even that is better to see than a boring movie. Strong reason to stay motivated to investigate this mystery.

73,brchthethird,"A rather unoriginal story elevated by a mature, nuanced Liam Neeson performance",7,22 January 2015,"Despite having a run-of-the-mill story, A WALK AMONG THE TOMBSTONES has some of best character work that Liam Neeson has done in a long time. In this film Liam Neeson plays Matt Scudder, a former cop turned unlicensed private detective. When a heroin dealer (Dan Stevens) approaches him about investigating his wife's disappearance, he ends up getting a little more than he bargained for. One thing I really liked about this film was the attention it paid to its characters. Matt Scudder was very well-developed, and even the supporting cast were given their due. Other than Matt, my favorite character was a black teenager who kind of ends up being Matt's sidekick. He was very down-to-earth and quite funny at times in a movie that tended to be more downbeat (which is perfectly fine). Even the villains, despite not having as much development, were interesting for their rather nonchalant approach to what they do and, like all of the characters in the movie, had various shades of grey as none of the characters were clear-cut good or bad. Another thing I found interesting, although it didn't add substantially to a deeper interpretation of the film, was that it was set in 1999 (in New York) around the time that Y2K was a big deal. Anxiety about that hangs over the entire film, although I can't say that really added too much. Yes, Matt Scudder is averse to technology (the internet, cell phones, etc), but it still felt like a missed opportunity to comment on a pivotal period in American history. Still despite all of this great supporting detail and several interesting characters, the story is somewhat routine in that it's basically just a private eye tracking down some sadistic criminals. There's also not much flair or originality in the way it's presented or unfolds. What I will say in the story's defense, though, is that the nature of the violence is handled rather tastefully and wasn't overly gratuitous like in some of the recent fare that Liam Neeson has been in. There was sufficient emotional impact to justify what was shown and it served the story beyond just having some action to placate fans who go see Liam Neeson movies for that reason. When all is said and done, though, despite the downbeat tone to the story it's not all depressing. There's a sequence towards the end which includes the 12 Steps from AA (Matt Scudder is a recovering alcoholic) that felt uplifting in a way, and that contrasts nicely with the anxiety and tension derived from the film's setting during the Y2K scare. Overall, I liked the film for being a little more thoughtful than most of the genre films that Liam Neeson has done in the past few years. He seemed right at home in this role, and I look forward to a sequel, should they choose to make one.",A Walk Among the Tombstones
74,Karl Self,"Taken rates 7.9 points, Tombstones only 6.6",10,2 March 2015,"Are you people blind? I more or less stumbled accidentally over A Walk Among The Tombstones and was smitten. Then I wanted more of the same (i. e. action flicks with Liam Neeson) and decided to check out Taken. It's basically Die Hard without the sarcasm. A fun excuse for tying cool kick-butt-scenes together. And while I absolutely enjoy scenarios where a single guy bare-handedly whoops a horde of swarthy Albanian drug-and-girl-traffickers who are better armed than a Transformer, on another level I'm deeply bored. The story is hammy, clichéd and has been done several times before. If you've never seen a vigilante movie before you can knock yourselves out here, but count me out.A Walk Among The Tombstones may not offer much new, but it doesn't have to. It's simply a fairly old-fashioned, and very, very dark, hardboiled detective flick. It's how the story is being told that amazed me. And how the characters, especially the nasty ones, are being drawn. I can't remember ever having seen a character as ambivalent as Jonas Loogan (the groundskeeper, played by Ólafur Darri Ólafsson) ever before. The sadism of the perpetrators struck me as realistic. It's not so much conveyed through actual footage of them hurting people, but when one of them relays information to prove that their hostage is still alive. You can tell he gets a kick out of leaving her relatives out on a limb for as long as possible.This is a movie which entertained me and provided me with new insights.",A Walk Among the Tombstones
75,Andy-296,Solid and entertaining noir with a great performance by Liam Neeson,9,8 January 2015,"An entertaining film noir set in the recent past. The movie begins in 1991, when off duty New York City cop Matt Scudler (Liam Neeson, in a great performance) ends up killing three burglars at a bar. The movie then moves to eight years later, when Scudler has retired (we will learn why much later in the movie) but still works as an unlicensed private detective. He is eating at a down market bar, when a former junkie he has met at an Alcoholic Anonymous meeting comes to see him. He tells him his brother Kenny needs to see him, can he please go. Curious about this, he goes and meets Kenny (Dan Stevens), who turns out to be a drug dealer. Kenny's wife has been kidnapped, the kidnappers warn him not to call the police, and even though he has paid the 400,000 dollar ransom, they still killed her. Kenny asks Scudler to find who the kidnappers were, and he sets out to investigate. (All of this happens in the first ten minutes of the movie, so I'm not giving away the plot).Curiously set in 1999 (a key shot has the Twin Towers still standing), this solid, slightly overlong noir (the name Sam Spade is referenced at several points during the film), has a solid secondary cast of little known performers. Based on a novel by Lawrence Block (the character of Scudder appears on several of his books). Directed by Scott Frank (screenwriter of Minority Report).",A Walk Among the Tombstones

Some see it as 2014's equivalent of ""Prisoners"" (it's really not even in the same league), while others have hated its tired story, one dimensional characters, and just the fact it has nothing new to offer. I'm somewhere in-between. I like Neeson, and he suits the role well. The direction is pretty good with plenty of detailed, and interesting location work.

77,TOMASBBloodhound,A grim and grizzly departure from mainstream thrillers for Neeson.,7,18 January 2015,"It was a mere week ago that I sat through the third, and hopefully final installment of the ""Taken"" franchise. A film like that with its excessive car chases and dumbed-down PG-13 violence can make a viewer long for a more compelling story of the horrors of true crime. And though A Walk Among the Tombstones seems hardly plausible, it nonetheless doesn't shy from depicting true evil and the sacrifices one has to make in order to defeat it. The end product is an awkwardly paced, but ultimately absorbing thriller, filled with gruesome violence and unsavory characters.Neeson plays Matt Scudder, a former NYC cop now working as a non-licensed private investigator. His checkered past as a lawman and his battles with alcohol have likely made himself only eligible for under-the-radar freelance work on the fringes of normal society. He would seem like the perfect candidate for the job that a drug dealer recruits him for. It seems two psychopaths have kidnapped the man's wife. But even though he paid them, they still chopped her up! After all, this guy is a drug dealer. Is he going to go running to the cops or FBI? They'd have to learn all about him, and he'd be out of business. After poking around, Neeson learns that these men have killed before, and will no doubt do so again. Apparently they are former DEA agents who know all they need to about potential victims and their families. Things come to a head when these two maniacs grab a Russian gangster's 14 yr old daughter and threaten to slice her up. At this point, the film shifts from psychological thriller to bloody action thriller. Writer/director Scott Frank scores points with his complex characters and his largely unconventional approach to what could have become Taken 2 1/2 if the studios had stepped in and forced his hand. Though the film is fairly slow in places, if you stick with it, the final 45 minutes or so make a nice finale. There are some elements that seem a little tacked on. The resourceful street kid who befriends Neeson seems like someone from another film, though they found some good uses for him towards the finale. Why did this film have to take place in 1999? Looking back, that seems like a pretty innocuous year. Fears of the upcoming Y2K event are mentioned a couple times early on, and then forgotten. Just like in real life, once it became obvious that there was no real scare to be worried about. The film also plays in some places like a commercial for AA, which isn't the worst idea for product placement I've seen in a film. Go ahead and give this one a look. 7 of 10 stars.The Hound.",A Walk Among the Tombstones
78,cultfilmfan,A Walk Among the Tombstones,9,27 September 2014,"A Walk Among the Tombstones, based on the novel of the same name by Lawrence Block, was, for me at least, a film that really came out of nowhere and I was surprised by how good the film was and how much I liked it. I like actor Liam Neeson, and while I didn't review it for this site, I did see and enjoyed his film Non Stop, from earlier this year. Full of plot holes, clichés and things that really wouldn't ever happen in real life? You bet, but it was a fun and entertaining popcorn summer time film and nothing more. A Walk Among the Tombstones, on the other hand is a totally different type of film and one that deserves considerable credit and needs to be taken in all seriousness. The film takes place in New York, just shy of the new millennium in a very dirty, drab, depressing looking and urban area of New York. The film is a detective story of sorts and Liam Neeson's character, Matt Scudder, is an interesting character who really carries the film, but also gives much more to the film as well because of the character's back story as well as his mostly calm nature, but when he means business we know that he has the capability to use and be violent as well. The film's cinematography was a major thing I liked about this film, with the right adjectives I mentioned earlier in this review. It gives the film the right tone and setting for the film and enhances the mood and just the general feeling that I think both the screenwriter and director want to get across to the audience. Everything in this film is so gritty and realistic, it is one of those films because you see such ugliness both on the streets as well as with the characters in the film, that you feel like you need to take a shower after the film because you feel filthy because the surroundings and the environment of the film make it all feel so real and as if you were right there along with them. The film's story is a strong one. I remember reading a Lawrence Block novel maybe about ten years, or so ago, but unfortunately the name of the novel escapes me as I write this, but I remember liking that too. The film's character development with Matt Scudder, and the other people who he is introduced to during the running time of the film are all very interesting. Also the more we get to know these characters the more fascinated, repulsed and overall compelled we are to keep watching this film to see how everything turns out. This is one of those films that grabbed me from the start of the film and did not let go till the end credits. It is a very intriguing and entertaining film. The action scenes are done just right as is the scenes where we have Matthew interacting with others and trying to piece together all the pieces of this puzzle. The film lets us in on a little bit of information at a time, but by the end, the film has an altogether satisfactory and well done ending, leaving us enough surprises and without spoiling anything earlier on. The acting from the whole cast is all very good here and everyone is in fine form. A lot of the actors I was unfamiliar with, but they still really carried their own enhancing the power of the film. Matthew's past and back story as it is revealed to us during the film is equally as interesting as the story involving the crime scene as well and I also found the scenes where Matthew bonds with a young teen named TJ, is another highlight of the film and adds some good personality and humour to what at times can be a dark and violent film. Crime films are not usually my thing because it falls into one of those categories, where when you have seen a couple of good ones and the rest all feel really formulated and copying the original really good said films. A Walk Among the Tombstones is an exception to that rule and I personally found myself overall very pleased with this stylish, powerful and overall slick put together film that will not only entertain you, but also keep you in suspense and is a good time spent at the theatre.",A Walk Among the Tombstones

82,Likes_Ninjas90,There doesn't seem to be many layers to unearth in this dour and grizzled adaptation of Lawrence Block's 1992 crime novel.,5,15 October 2014,"At the end of A Walk Among the Tombstones I wondered if there was a message or underlining theme to grasp and elevate this rather forgettable, violent crime film. There doesn't seem to be many layers to unearth in this dour and grizzled adaptation of Lawrence Block's 1992 crime novel. It is about a New York cop named Matt Scudder, who after a tragic shooting leaves the force and becomes an unlicensed private detective. After the initial shooting, the story shifts forward eight years and in this time Scudder has attended alcoholics anonymous. The film was written and directed by Scott Frank, an impressive screenwriter of the past, having penned scripts for the Elmore Leonard stories Get Shorty and Out of Sight and also Minority Report. These are fine crime films, especially the two Leonard ones, which have rich metatextual comedy and self-awareness offsetting the violence and crime. With Liam Neeson starring, the king of morbid in Hollywood, the mood here is bleaker and colder and not as much fun. He is reliably cast as Scudder but adapted long after the novel's release the character's traits are clichés: a figure of regret and bloodshed and a recovering alcoholic, making him sound like a former gunslinger from the Old West. In the visceral opening gunfight, Neeson with his long hair and trench coat could be riding on horseback such is the trigger-happy, right-wing vibe of his films. The most meta or playful the film becomes is when Scudder is pestered by a young black kid named TJ, played by former X-Factor contestant Brian 'Astro' Bradley, whose confidence and surprising touch for comedy steals scenes from right under Liam Neeson's nose. Not an easy task. Bradley assists him with a strange, vicious case where a drug dealer named Kenny (Dan Stevens) and his brother Peter (Boyd Holbrook) employ Scudder to help them find the men who kidnapped Kenny's wife and then killed her after paying the ransom money.It is necessary to assert how Tombstones is not a Taken film, which is a good thing because Neeson's trademark series is a boring excuse for fascism, mass murder and xenophobia. This film is slower and more measured, drive by investigative work. Yet its energy levels are curiously low, particularly from the static camera and staging and reliance on exposition in the dialogue, which is rarely playful except when TJ references fictional detectives like Philip Marlowe. The most engaging moments are when Neeson takes scenes by the scruff of the neck and asserts his authority, mostly through the power of his voice. When he makes a phone call to the killers, Scudder changes the rules forcing them to uphold his demands in order to receive their money. If the story achieves any subtext in the search for these killers it is the underused idea of averting doomsday or an oncoming darkness, with newspapers in the film showing the imminence of Y2K and rising gun sales. It is also about Scudder seeing the control a child has over his own life, which encourages him to move towards redemption because of the violent accident still haunting him. Unfortunately, the final climax nullifies most meaningful impressions of the film. The plot and a final choice devolve into Taken-like levels of male scuffling and gore, amounting to a terribly conventional and unpleasant finish. Additionally, a religious voice-over juxtaposed against the violence uncomfortably echoes righteous vengeance, implying an angel of death. These are the ending's flaws which make the film seem routine and pointless despite promising individual moments and some solid pieces of acting. It would also be nice to see Liam Neeson smile more on screen, perhaps in a romantic comedy someday.",A Walk Among the Tombstones

85,dfa120374,Somewhat Lacklustre But Overall Not Too Bad,5,17 April 2015,"Be prepared...if you're expecting A Walk Among the Tombstones to be an action-packed flick like Taken or Unknown then you will be disappointed here because this isn't a film like either of those. Instead, it's much more of slower paced thriller, which definitely won't be to everyone's taste, and when I say slower paced I do mean exactly that.This isn't actually that bad of a film but there are definitely parts of the movie where it just feels like it drags on a wee bit. I don't mind slower paced movies as long as they are decently written/filmed then I can get into them i.e. Prisoners, One Hour Photo, & Transcendence.With A Walk Among the Tombstones, however, I just felt that it got a bit dull here and there causing me to lose interest a few times. This isn't because it's a badly written/directed movie...it just didn't do enough to hold my attention much through those scenes. Thankfully, there are other moments that make up for this and is what stopped me from giving the film a lower rating than what I did. Also, there are a few scenes that have a sort of subliminal/hidden message to them (such as the 12-step program that gets read out at one of Scudder's AA meetings) in order to bring about a bit of depth to the story, and for the most part it works, but only if you are paying attention to what has been happening.Neeson does a great job (as always) as Matt Scudder, a recovering alcoholic ex-cop-turned-private-eye who has been given the task of trying to find the killers of a man's wife. Neeson seems to play these methodical, calculating characters so well and he always gets it pretty spot on for me. The supporting cast, such as David Harbour & Adam David Thompson as killers Ray & Albert respectively, also do a decent job bringing a nice menace to their characters.A Walk Among the Tombstones is definitely not as good as the Taken series, and isn't a patch on Non-Stop or Unknown, but it's still worth a watch IF you don't mind slower thrillers.",A Walk Among the Tombstones
86,billygoat1071,Crime Cinema Relic,8,24 September 2014,"A Walk Among the Tombstones tells a pretty basic detective story. It doesn't necessarily offer us anything new, and that truly is the case here: it's just another episode of a private detective. Even with all of the twisted scenarios, there isn't anything else big or even daring to the picture. While some might be bothered with its lack of innovation, fans of these types of mystery films would still have the pleasure. It has been kind of rare to have such crime thrillers like this in cinemas today, and by its simplicity in storytelling, it sure does deliver things right. What matters to the experience in the end is it's a finely crafted piece of noir that nearly glosses over to the fact that it's just a relic, but a pretty decent one.The film follows the classic roots of the genre, you won't find any sort of uniqueness around the storyline, but how it constructed each of its sequences still manage to be charming at the beginning and gripping along the way. It just lets the detective walk from one place to another to find clues and unfold questions. But it never lacks the tension, the film places its coldness to buildup an atmosphere that brings uncertainty to the fate of the investigation. The best thing about it is it's simple. It doesn't bother adding some mind-blowing or ridiculous twists, it just digs within a world where some evil can be found in any street. Settling with the characters is as well one of its finest moments, they may not have the most original arcs, but it is undeniably entertaining when it lingers to them.The direction is predictably slick, and it totally benefits by it for making every scene of bleakness and violence emotionally effective. People shouldn't take for granted its decent camera-work that sharply displays its vital points. It gets even better when explores around its main man: Liam Neeson is now commonly used as an action hero, but here the film rather uses the better side of that reputation which is keeping the audience feel that he is a dangerous man to deal with, even without revealing much of the fists and gunpoint, it's still a totally compelling depiction of his character's cold, brooding personality.My personal enjoyment to the film is how refreshing to see a mystery film this straightforward and unpretentiously dark in modern cinema. I mean I might as well seen one in any crime television series running today, but it's a lot fascinating to witness it in this form, plus a tone this gritty, a style so clever, and a performance from its main star that makes it more interesting. Again, you won't find anything groundbreaking to the film, but leaving that thought behind would make you realize that it is still a terrifically put together, unpredictably told crime thriller. And I bet that's already enough for this sort of entertainment.",A Walk Among the Tombstones

88,TheSquiss,Neeson does kidnap & gruesome murder. Properly. Taken 3 this ain't!,6,16 October 2014,"A Walk Among the Tombstones is a surprisingly good thriller that grasps the attention and grips it tightly until the final frame. Why surprisingly good? Because in recent years, in between periodic heavyweight delights like The Dark Knight Rises, Liam Neeson has unfortunately filled his time with humdrum fare (Taken, Taken 2, Taken 3) and some absolute, stinking clangers (Battleship).A Walk Among the Tombstones, however, takes him back to the dark, brooding action drama heroics of The Grey and earlier treats, and whilst it doesn't have the balls-out action thrills of, say, The A-Team, it is a well rounded action thriller that isn't too far away from the accessible side of Elmore Leonard.Mark Scudder (Liam Neeson) is a dried-out, unlicenced private detective who walked away from the police force after a drink-fuelled bad decision soured his heroic deeds. He is retained by drug dealer Kenny Kristo (Dan Stevens) to find the men who kidnapped his wife. Initially reluctant, Scudder is persuaded when Kristo informs him he paid the ransom only to discover his wife was already dead. A matter of kidnap turns into a case of gruesome murder and Kristo wants revenge, well aware that his wife's kidnap will not be the last.Essentially, A Walk Among the Tombstones is a classic cat and mouse romp. Fairly quickly we are told who the perpetrators are, but the excitement isn't in solving the crime but seeing if Scudder can beat the rapidly ticking clock, and how low he will stoop in order to prevent yet more horror.When presented with decent material and on his game, Neeson makes for an imposing hero that you'd want on your side but wouldn't mess with. As Scudder, he once again delivers a gruff, troubled protagonist with sincerity to match his troubles. This isn't a great departure or startling revelation, more a comfortable, reliable turn from a leading man the big screen absolutely adores.Making great strides in distancing himself from his nice boy Downton Abbey English gentleman persona is Dan Stevens. After this month's The Guest, in which he got down and really dirty, his Kristo has a gentler side but he's still a pleasant step into the shadows from Mathew Crawley and a definite statement from Stevens that he can make the transition from British TV to Hollywood's silver screen.There's nothing groundbreaking on show in A Walk Among the Tombstones but that isn't always necessary if the delivery is good. The pace is steady with occasional bursts of excitement and by the time the blood has dried and the gun smoke has dissipated you'll be ready to take a step up to something really cold, hard and dangerous.For more reviews from The Squiss, subscribe to my blog and like the Facebook page.",A Walk Among the Tombstones
89,RevRonster,It moves slowly but it's not bad...,6,26 December 2014,"The trailer for this film made it look like a gritty and dark crime thriller that had the tough guy that could make short work of the entire Expendables crew in it. And since Liam Neeson is in it, my mind instantly started to think about ""Taken"" and I had hoped we were going to get a gritty, dark crime thriller with killer action and Liam Neeson kicking tail and giving off his cold-eyed stare and his quiet growl of a voice. It was sorta that There wasn't much action in the film since it was more about the investigation of a crime and not so much of the part where Neeson take justice into his own hands. As it turns out, that wasn't necessarily a bad thing because the story was pretty intense and very interesting. Additionally, the performances from Neeson and the rest of the cast were very solid and very authentic feeling. The only downside to the film is the fact the story moves at a very slow, methodical pace and that makes for some boring moments that aren't very exciting or thrilling. However, the entire film isn't this way and these parts only come here and there.I wasn't completely blown away with ""A Walk Among the Tombstones"" but I definitely wasn't disappointed. The acting is great and the story definitely has its moments that put me on edge. It's a great movie for a single visit but I didn't see much replay value in it for me.",A Walk Among the Tombstones
90,destroyerwod,"Unsatisfied - Warning, heavy spoilers !!",6,26 March 2015,"So i knew from the start this was gonna be a psychological cop thriller and not a Taken clone. I am fine with that. On the other hand i think the way the case is shown is a bit easy going. For a small part of the movie we do guess who the killer(s) is gonna be but then we find out pretty soon and after that its just a matter of getting to them.Some stuff in the movie make no sense, like why a drug dealer would not have henchmen and be ready to take action himself. I get that he need to hire Matt, but once the killer are found, why in the hell does his drug addict brother is the one holding the rifle... because he was in the army? There should had been much more henchmen ready to do the job.Then when the little girl is safe, they could had do so much more to get the guys there. Also i am sorry but the ending felt totally unsatisfying to me. The worst of the 2 killers is killed by his partner, and its never really explained why, and the second one get off pretty easy too. Kenny which was the one giving the job to Liam Neeson's character end up dead in a very badly off screen scene.I never read the book but the ending i saw online made much much more sense than the movie ending. This guys where horrible and they deserved punishment.So in the end was i interested in the story to finish the movie? Yes, but if the movie do not show much action, one would expect a better psychological/cop case thriller side.In the end glad i saw it, but will hardly ever watch it again.",A Walk Among the Tombstones
91,bbickley13-921-58664,"Liam, has done it again!",7,27 September 2014,"Liam Neeson, a thinking man's action hero? He tends to bring a sophistication and a complexity to his characters in a genre were it's perfectly fine to be one denominational.The movie about an ex-cop going after killers who target the families of rich criminals is for the most part a dramatic piece with some really cool violence gun play inter cut through the entire film.Liam's character seems like a rip-off of the dude he played in Non-Stop, so much in fact that you could call this a James Bond styled sequel. Although, Non-Stop only touches on the main characters problems, Walk among the tombstones goes deeper into untangling his demons, A specific set of skills that Liam seems to implement well in his action films.It's a by the book action film for Liam, mixing dramatic tension with burst of violent action.

92,osj2507,"Interesting, different and true",8,28 June 2015,"I had heard that this was something new from Liam Neeson, we all know him from the latests more action packed movies, he is the bad ass who is coming to get you if you hurt his family or friends. This is somewhat different, it is a thriller, not an action film, but I had the feeling that the angry Irishman would be there at some point :)It is a good film, Liam Neeson is not way of his hardcore revenge element, but his character has more depth and personality then some of the others. He is an old cop, turned private investigator, he is tough, but does have a past that weighs on his mind and conscience, this makes him live his life differently and choose or maybe not choose assignments because what if it would go wrong or he would discover things that he shouldn't and could deliver what he promised.We are moving in a dark and gloomy part of town, lots of deviants and types you would not like to owe anything to, angry types that would steal and kill without hesitation. The scenery is dark, the lighting low, in many scenes it makes them all seem a bit more shady then they are and sometimes outright unpleasant.It is an entertaining film, some action in the very classic hard hitting Irish way, lots of well written and acted story. It is not chilling as a thriller could be, but it is unpleasant and dark",A Walk Among the Tombstones
93,ArchonCinemaReviews,Extra disturbing crime but mediocre film overall,5,6 December 2014,"In production since 2002, A Walk Among the Tombstones is the stylish film adaptation of Lawrence Block's gritty novel of the same name.A Walk Among the Tombstones is the tale of ex-NYPD officer turned private investigator Matthew Scudder, played by Liam Neeson , hired to find out who kidnapped and murdered a drug dealer's wife.The film and screenplay by Scott Frank is adapted from the long running Scudder novel series by Lawrence Block. With any adaptation it is difficult who is at fault for aspects of the work being lost in translation. A Walk Among the Tombstones is your standard crime-triller with a cliché protagonist. Though the crimes themselves are heinously grisly and unnerving, the story is quite simple.As Scudder investigates the aspects of the kidnapping and subsequent murder, despite the paid ransom, he is led in several directions hinting at a pattern of violence of the suspects. Perhaps all these details, people and crimes were more compelling in the literature but after fifteen minutes the film is disconnected and detached. Most of the characters seemed superfluous diversions, with the exception of Brian 'Astro' Bradley's TJ who managed to steal every scene, even those with Liam Neeson.Scott Frank wrote the screenplay in 2002 and by the time of production was able to also direct the feature. He takes a stylized approach reliant upon distracting mood music and gray overtones. Though the effect and direction adds to the unnerving suspense of the cat and mouse pursuit, it suffers an unforeseen secondary by-product. The perverse killers themselves are excessively deranged and violence, fetishizing pain and death.Throughout the entirety of the film I anticipated a subsidiary layer to the film from the point of view of the murderers, portrayed by David Harbour and Adam David Thompson. I was sadly disappointed as this reveal in motive or plot never occurred, despite the several unnecessary factoids regarding the killers, and the film is actually quite superficial.For more reviews of all the recent releases, please check out OUR WEBSITE.",A Walk Among the Tombstones
94,socrates99,The way noir used to be without the skips in logic,8,23 September 2014,"Liam Neeson is probably the only actor who could have made this movie as memorable as it is. His strong presence makes it move along as if he was born to do this. And maybe he was.I remember watching noir movies on TV as a child and being frustrated with them. Too often I couldn't follow the clues or the plot and it wasn't until I was an adult that I realized there often wasn't necessarily a logical reason for the way things unfold. That was more than disappointing, it was disrespectful.No such slipshod writing in this movie. I can imagine Mr. Neeson having felt the same way and being excited about finally acting in a crime film where all the pieces are there and connected. What difference if it moves slowly and deliberately? You get to savor each step in his search for some truly despicable lowlifes. And almost every such step is solidly plausible and within reach.Mr. Neeson is very good, and considering he's in his 60s, it's amazing how well he carries himself through the physical scenes. Other key roles are the villains in this flick who go along way toward selling their depravity. Kudos to the director, Scott Frank, as well for sticking to exactly the pace this script needed.I've heard some say they are turned off by the violence against women here but I would say don't stay away unless films have frightened you inordinately in the past.",A Walk Among the Tombstones
95,p-jonsson,Decent enough but nothing out of the ordinary,6,15 March 2015,"This movie had quite some premise and it is a decent enough movie but, sadly, it never really rises out of the ordinary. We have some really despicable criminals and I mean some real creepy nutcases and we have Liam Neeson as a gritty former cop turned private investigator. Good recipe to start with I would say.Unfortunately it never really took off. Liam Neeson is doing a good job of portraying the former cop and he is pretty much making the picture. The creepy guys are, well creepy but they never really get to shine in their creepiness. Most of the other characters around are just decoration with the possible exception of the young brat whom I personally just found annoying.Speaking of annoying I have to say that the AA sessions and the voice overs from them pretty much falls into that very category. They felt at best like unnecessary fillers to me. I do not know why it is so popular to portray ""heroes"" as drunks or former drunks.The movie is not a quick paced one. It is more of a thriller than a action one although there are a few outbursts of action. Sometimes it goes quite far down the road of some real detective work and sometimes it just jumps about leaving a few inconsistencies and plot wholes hanging around.I would say that this movie is a fairly ordinary, good but nothing special, crime story about two psychopaths and a gritty former coop given the task of chasing them down. Without Liam Neeson as a lead actor more or less carrying the movie along it would have been a fairly bland movie.",A Walk Among the Tombstones
96,room102,Pointless,5,9 October 2015,"Liam Neeson in a thriller about kidnapping (what, again? yes, again). It's well acted, but there are just too many problems with it, mainly plot-related. It goes from place to place in a weird way, seems to go one way but goes to another. But mainly it's just pointless. At least twice during the movie I thought it's the end, but it continued. When it actually ended, I thought: So what's the point?Side note: All the gun fights scenes were incredibly loud. I don't know if that's a problem of the film or the cinema itself - because all the other scenes were in decent volume - but those scenes (especially all the guns firing) were so incredibly loud that it actually hurt my ears (or perhaps I shouldn't go to the cinema with a headache/migraine).",A Walk Among the Tombstones
97,buckikris,A Walk Into The Danger Zone,8,2 March 2015,"In 1991 Matt Scudder was a N.Y.C. police officer. One day two gang bangers come into a where Scudder is at. They kill the bartender; Scudder chases after them, and one is killed instantly, and the other is still on the run. While Chasing after the second, he keeps firing and finally wounding him. One of Scudder's bullets takes a bounce, he doesn't realize it at first. While approaching the scene he realizes the bullet struck; and hit a little girl killing her instantly. Eventually he is forced to resign or get fired due to a drinking problem.Now it is the year 1999, Matt is an unlicensed private eye in New York City. One night coming back from an Alcoholics Anonymous meeting Scudder stops into a diner for dinner. While there he meets Peter Kristo( Boyd Holbrook) from A.A.. Peter is a heroin addict and alcoholic, who was once in the Gulf war. He asks Scudder if he could help his brother Kenny(Dan Stevens). At first Scudder wasn't going to help, but decided to met with Kenny. When Kenny and Scudder meet, Scudder wonders why the police aren't involved. Scudder is suspicious, and keeps asking what Kenny does for a living. Matt finds out Kenny is a drug trafficker. Kenny's wife Carrie(Razane Janmal) has been kidnapped. When Scudder finds out what Kenny does for a living he says no. He doesn't get involved with that type of business. Upon returning to his place Scudder finds Kenny outside his door. Kenny pleads for his help and brings a tape recorder for Matt to hear. He shares this recording with Matt, it is a morbid recording with Carrie being tortured and pleading for her life. When Scudder hears the tape he changes his mind and takes the case. Matt goes to the area where Kenny found her remains. While in the area he interviews witnesses, gets descriptions on the suspects. Now he has something to go one. These descriptions involves two males, dressed as repairmen, in a blue/white van. He goes to the library, does some research; old school style. While there he befriends T.J.( Brian ""Asto"" Bradley). Who helps Scudder with the research on a computer. When they come across a kidnapping/killing of a Marie Gotteskind(Marielle Heller), who was found in the same way. It comes out later that Marie was a D.E.A. agent. As Scudder discovers another killing a florist, Leila Andersen( Laura Berm), who was found in pieces in a cemetery. Jonas( Olafur Darri Olafsson) is the caretaker at the cemetery.While talking to Jonas Matt realizes he could be looking for someone in law enforcement. Jonas tell Scudder the name of one of the suspects is Ray. Then Jonas jumps off the building, because he new Ray would find him. Before Jonas leaps he tells Scudder about Leila and how he would spy on her and her boyfriend. Her connection is her boyfriend, Reuben(Mark Consuelas) a drug dealer who Matt goes and sees. He tells him what happened; and how she was kidnapped by two guys never to be seen again. Then Matt realizes the two guys he is looking for could be former D.E.A. confidential informants. These two are Ray(David Harbour) and Albert(Adam David Thompson), they carry files on these people , watch them, and carry walkie talkies. Then their next victim is Yuri(Sebastian Roche) they want his wife(Lana De Lauren), but she is bed ridden; due to a brain tumor. Yuri is another drug trafficker. Ray and Albert kidnap Yuri's daughter( Danielle Rose Russell). Peter Kristo tell Scudder what has happened, because Scudder came back to return Kenny's money. This time Scudder is going to put this to a stop, and he has a plan. While at Yuri's house, Scudder and Ray have heated phone calls; a money exchange for Yuri's daughter. Scudder tell Ray that he is calling the shots; and in order for them to get the money the girl must be alive. Scudder tell Ray to met them at the cemetery where Leila was found. The plan is to have the girl exchanged before the money is turned over. The money is mixed with real and fake bills. Once the exchange begins the girl is safely with her dad, they Al realizes they got screwed he shoots Ray. Then this proceeds back to Al and Ray's place. Al eventually kills Ray, and Scudder ends it by killing Al.This is a great movie, and you don't need to be a die hard Neeson fan to enjoy it either. It has plenty of suspense in it, and as usual Neeson is terrific. The ending is great T.J. has a father figure/friend; and the way they did the twin towers through CGI was done well. Action roles are great of Liam Neeson; but I still think his best work is in roles like Kinsey, Schindler's List, and Les Miserables. I hope he will return to these roles; because in those roles his true talent really shines.",A Walk Among the Tombstones

100,TheMarwood,Pulpy noir,6,13 January 2015,"A Walk Among the Tombstones has been in various stages of development since the late 90's and while it's a decent enough film, it's hard to see what kept this story on the development back burner for almost two decades and not simply just forgotten about. It's a pulpy noir about an ex-cop turned private investigator, who is hired by a drug trafficker to find the two men who abducted his wife and chopped her into dozens of pieces after he paid the ransom. Neeson underplays his performance nicely, considering the character's back story has him a recovered alcoholic, with no ties to his family, who accidentally shot a little girl - and Neeson could have overdone it with the brooding, but he does good work here. Scott Frank's screenplay is all straightforward business, there's very little of his usual wit on display and there's no surprises. It's a grim throwback to small films a few decades past. The film's largest problem is how the killers are presented and it's at this point that the film doesn't really gel. There's an aire of mystery about these two monstrous killers who are targeting the family members of drug dealers, but that's dropped when the film simply and un-dramatically introduces the two men not too far into this story. They were obscured by shadow and darkness early on and then directed as if clouding their identity a few scenes earlier never happened. The scenes with the two serial killers just aren't strong enough and any mystery or foreboding sense of dread that the film had, vanishes the more time we spend with those two. There's also a half baked friend/mentor relationship between Neeson and a young homeless boy, that doesn't feel extraneous, but isn't fleshed out enough to be believable. A Walk Among the Tombstones is well made and certainly never boring, but with all that time the film languished in development hell, it's a shame Frank didn't deliver a stronger screenplay.",A Walk Among the Tombstones

I'm not familiar with Lawrence Block's books and don't remember ""8 Million Ways to Die"" vividly enough to make any connection even if I were.It opens with a 0:40 scene that is tersely written with subtext that doesn't become clear until later shot with the characters in shadowy profile. Rob Gonsalves describes the scene as stoically gripping. I thought the scene could easily be cut for all it informs the movie.I found the villains contrived. They are evil because they are evil with psychopathologies that compel them to behave in whatever manner is most convenient to the exigencies of the script.The movie is well made with a refreshing lack of jiggly-cam shots.

102,martinrobertson300482,"An intriguing, thoughtful plot",8,4 October 2014,"""A Walk among the Tombstones"" is either a welcome step away from Liam Neesons action hero stasis, or a disappointing misstep into quieter movies. If you think its possibly the later then you should probably stop reading. Because i personally think the movie is a nice change. ""Taken"" was a one-off. All the ""Non-stops"" and ""Unknowns"" we've had since have demeaned what a great actor Liam Neeson is, and this moody drama does a half decent job of reestablishing him.He does play a Private investigator though. Which probably doesn't sound like to much of a change. But the movies mysterious set-up, and creepy story had me invested. More than it would if Neeson was just out to kick some bad guys butts again.Though it will almost definitely disappoint those wanting more ""Taken"" style fighting/car chases, as a Slower paced thriller it has an intriguing, thoughtful plot, and plenty of dark atmosphere, instead of forced, fast action.

104,herbqedi,Grim,5,2 October 2014,"Liam Neeson embodies Bloch's detective Matt Scudder, a reformed alcoholic, in expert fashion. He captures his character's regret, angst, expertise, solemn commitment, cynicism, balance by a strong desire to make amends except when doing so would harm others. For all of us Neeson fans and perhaps even the uninitiated if there are any, this is a great start. But that's it. The movie goes through its paces trying to find an psychotic pair of deadly efficient ex-DEA serial killers who extort money from their victims before killing them. Doing so immerses the guilt-ridden Neeson (from killing a kid while pursuing 3 bad guys while a bit drunk) into the worlds of organized and disorganized drug dealers. These worlds are ones we have encountered in countless TV shows and movies also based in New York. With a cast of little known actors of workmanlike but unexceptional talent (at least as shown in this movie) and with a script mostly bereft of humor, Neeson has to be the whole show. And his character is one-note, changing little, and experiencing little growth beyond his hallowed 12-step program.The one exception is the young actor Astro as TJ. His relationship with Scudder gives the film life and gives us a rooting interest in things. It's a solid supporting turn that imbues an otherwise relentlessly grim movie with some humor and empathy, something sorely lacking through most of it. Neeson and Astro are almost enough to make us forget that there are no clever plot twists, no revelations, no intriguing insights, just hunting down and killing the psychos. I checked the spoiler box if you consider the fact that Neeson's Scudder prevails over the psycho as spoiling the world's most predictable ending. Overall, this is certainly a watchable movie but it lacks anything special and is relentlessly grim.",A Walk Among the Tombstones
105,talisencrw,A recommendable contemporary Liam Neeson-billed crime-thriller!,8,17 September 2016,"Though I haven't watched a lot of them yet (I've mainly devoted my time, of late, to catching up on 1920-1970s cinematic milestones), I have a profound respect for the new roles Liam Neeson has taken on in recent years. It makes me think of what would have been had my favourite actor ever, James Cagney, hadn't basically retired for the quiet life in the early 60's, when the perfect storm of 'great actors in B-movies' hit the fans.My lady is more a horror aficionado, and of recent vintage films, so it was nice to throw this on for a spin and show her its neo-noir tendencies, almost as if going through a 'make your own movie' template, checking them off one-by-one. I don't mind that sort of rote predictability if it's done right, and, though heavily flawed, for the most part it does. By the climax, I basically only cared for four things: that the kidnapped girl, Matthew Scudder and TJ were alive, and that the two kidnappers/murderers got their just desserts, whether it be lengthy incarceration or murder, anything so their crime spree would be ended. The film was well-made and a very enjoyable experience, so considering the relatively minor flaws (especially the one-dimensional aspect of the antagonists), I would definitely recommend at least a watch for most cinephiles out there, especially those interested in 'true crime' type of contemporary American cinema.",A Walk Among the Tombstones

108,krzysiektom,much better than expected,9,4 November 2014,"I liked this one quite a lot. The story is decent, the dialogs excellent, photography and direction are quality, the acting as well. The film is dark, portrays New York as a sad, lonely place, but probably because the main character feels that way. The depiction of drug dealers is quite a novelty here, far from clichés. It may seem that Neeson is playing again the same character as before, in Taken for example, but actually his role is different, he has none of ""Taken"" lead's special abilities, things do not come easy for him, he is getting beaten and pushed around a few times. I guess this film is an homage to the genre of lone detective stories, brusque and tough loners but with a heart of gold and an inner code of moral conduct. Like Sam Spade and Philip Marlowe - both of them are mentioned in the film. There is also subtle humor, which is very welcome to counter the feeling of gloom and doom. The action and violence scenes are well made and pretty realistic. This is not a typical modern action film, it is more a detective investigation/ psychological drama kind of film.

109,hrkepler,Passable Crime Thriller,6,1 June 2018,'A Walk Among the Tombstones' is little bit more than usual Liam Neeson action flick. Bleak and gritty psychological thriller which roots definitely lie in the neo-noir genre and it also stands somewhat as an homage to hard boiled detective stories (Sam Spade and Philip Marlowe are referenced several times and the screenplay is based on the novel of the same name by author Lawrence Block). Although the film barely manages to float over the usual genre clichés it fails to offer anything new and by the end it is still a standard fare that is pretty forgettable.

Within the first hour you'll get way more from it than any trailer. It tells its story in an almost artistic manner, especially with the credits sequence at the beginning, following a very well done action scene. Liam Neeson rarely if ever disappoints, and this movie is no exception. However, I was more drawn to the characters portrayed by Dan Stevens, Boyd Holbrook, and, disturbingly enough, David Harbour. It is a hard to watch (or listen to) film at times, which means it's doing its job well. Despite all of this the movie moves at a snail's pace, which can be effective at times but at others just feels like a mudslide. The third act offers an unexpected shift, not so much of a twist as it is simply a deviation from the norm in movies like that, so part of me applauded it but another part of me was a little disappointed.",A Walk Among the Tombstones
111,loco_73,Greetings from the darkside!,8,27 September 2014,"Over the past two years or so, something exciting started happening at the movies...at least it seems so to me, since these are only my thoughts and opinions. It is the return of the gritty dramas, movies that are throwbacks to those 1960s and 70s flicks in the tradition of ""Bullit"", ""Mean Streets"", ""Serpico"", ""The Conversation"", ""Dog Day Afternoon"", ""The French Connection"" ""...And Justice For All"" and others. Television has had this trend well at hand, with series like ""OZ"", ""The Wire"", ""Breaking Bad"", ""The Sopranos"", ""The Shield"", ""Brotherhood"" etc. The most recent one being ""True Detective"", a series that truly opened my eyes to this ""new"" old trend. Now these movies don't have be about cops or criminals, some are and some aren't. The first two movies that began this retro trend were ""Killing Them Softly"" and ""Out Of The Furnace"". Both movies were almost completely overlooked and ignored, but I liked them nonetheless and consider them some of the best I've seen in years. While the summer was being wasted away and drowned in sequels, prequels, reboots, the latest YA or superhero adaptation, the fall has brought yet a few more of these gritty movies I am talking about, ""The Drop"", ""The Equalizer"" and the movie of this here review, ""A Walk Among The Tombstones"". I will be reviewing those other movies on their own merits. What first grabbed my attention was the title. While sinister sounding, I must admit that it is one of the best in recent times for me. Then I understood that the main character and storyline are part of a series of novels which made me somewhat apprehensive, especially after Tom Cruise's ""Jack Reacher"" fiasco...I needn't have worried...this is a far superior movie anchored by a good performance from Liam Neeson. Now, while the trailer might give the impression, and the audiences might be expecting it, this is not ""Taken"". While Liam Neeson's career seems to have been in many ways re - invigorated with movies like ""Taken"", ""Unknown"" and others, to me at least his career and worth as an actor were never in doubt. But one positive by-product of ""Taken"", is that it also revived the action thriller once more. That being said, ""A Walk Among The Tombstones"" is not ""Taken"". This is the story of a man beset by the demons of his past, demons stemming from his choices or perhaps the lack thereof, all of which led to a terrible, costly (costly to the soul that is) outcome...Liam Neeson's character, a former cop, is a broken and defeated man who is literally living out the consequences of his former choices, or lack thereof, by etching out a meagre existence on the margins of society, as an unlicensed private investigator, doing favours for the sort of people who would rather not involve the police and leave out the authorities from their personal affairs.One such case in particular seems to affect him personally, dragging out the past he so desperately tries to forget but cannot help living with. As he delves further into the shadows and darkness stemming not from some supernatural force but from human depravity and evil, he confronts himself, his own limits and shortcomings, but also discovers a chance for redemption and the fact that his life, such as it is, might yet be worth something. Movies such as this one, and those I mentioned earlier, show us the world as it is, with all the good and the bad, with all its parts, light and dark and everything in between. It portrays people that we pretend not to know and strenuously try to avoid having any contact with during our daily lives, for they are sometimes a reflection of our own failure to care enough. The broken, the downtrodden and the forgotten. American audiences have largely avoided movies such as this one like the plague at the box office since it shows an America that doesn't jive with the sugar coated bulls*it reality they are being spoonfed everyday! That is why the closing shot is even more poignant. Lest we forget...",A Walk Among the Tombstones
112,calicut110,Very entertaining,7,15 August 2021,This is a class above most of the thrillers that come out these days. Liam Neeson is great and much better that most of his new movies. The story is very dark and disturbing at points but it's a slow burner and I enjoyed my time.,A Walk Among the Tombstones
113,abouhelier-r,A Walk Among the Tombstones,6,17 October 2014,"Private investigator Matthew Scudder is hired by a drug kingpin to find out who kidnapped and murdered his wife. A Walk Among the Tombstones is directed by Scott Franck and is starring Dan Stevens and Liam Neeson. First sight I thought this movie would be as badass as Taken and The Equalizer but it's not, this movie is more of an investigative movie; in which Liam Neeson's character is this private investigator and he is connecting the dots. This movie takes it time that's why sometime you feel like the film is two and a half hour long but it's not. It's nice to see Liam Neeson actually playing an other role than this orderly badass we used to, here he's the main guy in an investigative role, properly acting. He's good. Even if the action is not here. Villains are creepy dick heads, but not in a right way. In fact in a movie like this you have to make your villain character functional, someone you feel really uncomfortable with on screen. Overall A Walk Among the Tombstones might not be what you thought if you're expecting an other The Equalizer movie or something like that: it's not. It doesn't move quickly, sometimes it's even slow but there are some interesting investigation scenes where you are able to see the actual investigation and those dots pieces together.",A Walk Among the Tombstones
114,adrian-43767,Violence definitely begets violence to the point of nonsense,6,26 August 2018,"Liam Neeson has mastered this type of role where he quietly dishes out some sound beatings and shoots to kill. In this case, he is a former cop who comes to the rescue of a drug baron whose wife was raped, killed and cut to pieces, after he had paid ransom. Why the abductors bothered to leave the drug baron alive is baffling but perhaps they thought they would never be tracked down.So Neeson goes to great lengths to find the murdering thieves and somehow - not very credibly, including info from a source who commits completely pointless suicide - tracks them down, with the help of a ultra bright African American kid, and of the revenge-seeking drug baron.According to the old adage, revenge is best served as a cold dish, but here it is served with heavy shooting and gore, and the baddies survive even after looking deader than door nails. Toward the end, Neeson suggests to the drug baron that he not kill the main evil doer but turn him over to justice, but then he does it himself.Moral lesson? I don't know that there is one,. Action sequences aplenty and generally well done. Neeson's performance is reliable, as ever in this type of role. Photography is good and screenplay just gets by in terms of believability, despite a fair number of holes.Worst sin: far too long. 30 min less , and less gore, might have made it a good movie.",A Walk Among the Tombstones
115,Tehmeh,Old-fashioned and effective crime mystery,8,15 August 2015,"The older I get, the more I appreciate these kind of throwbacks. ""A Walk Among the Tombstones"" approaches the crime mystery/thriller genre with style. This is a movie that could've been made in the 1970s.Liam Neeson has done some crappy action movies for the last few years. Don't be afraid, because this is not one of them. This is a detective story with the usual dark undertones. It's enough of a slow burn, so that you can really suck in the atmosphere, but it knows when to pick up the pace as well. It hits all the right beats.The cinematography looks great from the very first shot. Every shot is framed well, and the lighting deserves some compliments too. When a movie is shot carefully, it makes a world of a difference.Actors are great. Neeson himself is somewhat wooden, but I think it's intentional. He plays that detective archetype which is fitting for this movie. Young Brian Bradley, or ""Astro"" which is probably his rapper name, was surprisingly good. Stevens, Holbrook, Harbour and Thompson were all effective, and I can't find a single thing wrong with the supporting cast. Even Laura Birn (who appears in the movie only as a victim of crime, shown in the opening credits and short snippets throughout the movie) was very good. It's not often when I check the names of crime movie victims. Surprise, she's a fellow Finn. Well done.This movie is dark and violent, but it never goes into that area where it starts to be more disturbing than interesting, it keeps a balance that's hard to strike. ""A Walk Among the Tombstones"" wouldn't have worked with a PG-13 rating, that much is clear.To summarize, this is a well-shot, well acted crime thriller with a sense of style and respect towards its genre. The movie is not about Neeson's character, but about the crime and the story surrounding it. I won't say it's a modern classic (like ""Prisoners"" is for me), but it comes close. They don't make these movies that much anymore.",A Walk Among the Tombstones
116,freshclean-66-318608,I Was Fooled!,6,10 February 2015,"I thought this was going to be another action filled Liam Neeson film. I didn't bother reading the descriptions under the title on IMDb calling it a crime/drama/mystery with the word action being nowhere in site. I just automatically assumed it would be an action movie because Liam Neeson had the leading role. Now, the movie wasn't bad it's just that I expected a lot of action in this film. It was a bit cliché but it still kept me interested. I didn't find myself wondering about things other than the film and having fantasies about hitting the return icon on the Redbox kiosk screen and having the Redbox kiosk pull the DVD back in like I do with most wack films. Like I said before, it's not a bad film. Matt Scudder(Liam Neeson) is a private investigator who is hired by a drug dealer to find the people who kidnapped his wife and along the way Matt Scudder finds a little helper in a kid named TJ(Brian 'Astro' Bradley). See, a bit cliché but still alright.",A Walk Among the Tombstones
117,craig-hopton,Pedestrian,5,1 January 2018,"Liam Neeson does a decent job as the moody retired detective Matthew Scudder who finds himself on the trail of the brutal murderers of the wife of a drug kingpin.It's a reasonably gripping movie. There's regular tension as Scudder puts himself at risk in graveyards, strange buildings, basements etc. The supporting cast all do a good job.But it's nothing special. The plot is boringly predictable. The identity of the murderers is revealed to the viewer early on (and Scudder figures it out himself not much later) and from then on it's a fairly pedestrian chase and fight between them and Scudder.There's also a strange lack of any major female characters. It's one of those movies where women are only represented as victims.An ok watch but not really one I'd recommend.",A Walk Among the Tombstones
118,lois-lane33,Its a movie.,5,2 November 2015,I thought this film was a surprise-a Liam Neeson film that had a whole bunch of bloopers in it that I missed completely the first time I saw it. A character gets killed in a shoot out in the park only to seemingly reappear minutes later (he looks almost identical to another actor) and a guy who has been obliterated by several shots fired at virtually point blank range is shown to have survived by wearing a bullet proof vest but a few minutes later is shown dying with the other guy who has just been killed very much alive standing beside Liam Neeson's character watching bullet proof vest guy die. Confusing. Then the bulletproof vest guy guy who has died in the park reappears minutes later injured in a van with his cohort. Whatever. I think the film has some good ideas which are obliterated by this lack of internal logic not at the very end but close to the very end-like they all of a sudden just up and gave up on the film. I think many films pass at first viewing but not at the second one where you are more apt to pick up on an errors in them and sometimes there are really big errors in the film that can really take away from the films appeal. The fact the film is about two off the charts bad guys doesn't change the fact it bombs because of flow errors. I think they made this film too fast.,A Walk Among the Tombstones
119,bhester0806,We all forget Liam can act,8,13 February 2021,"This movie is great for what it is. A murder, true crime redemption arc mystery. Go into it with the expectations to enjoy an hour or two and you won't be let down.",A Walk Among the Tombstones
120,FilmMuscle,Liam Neeson Is An Actor First and An Action Star Second,8,22 September 2014,"Credits roll, and a haunting cover of ""Black Hole Sun"" by Nouela plays (the same song from the trailer). Its mellow and dilatory tune perfectly encapsulates the bleak, somber tone of this chilling thriller where Liam Neeson isn't the invincible badass his reputation usually proclaims. We first meet Matt Scudder (Neeson) in a flashback in the early 1990's where he clumsily takes down three crooks in a murky New York City. Fast forward to 1999, and he's retired-apparently scarred by his own incompetence on that wretched day-laying back at his favorite restaurant when an acquaintance (Eric Nelsen) informs him of a significant (unofficial) assignment. Oh no, a retired, gloomy detective returns for one last job? And yet, the film astonishingly manages to feature these kinds of irksome clichés but executes them in such an exceptional way as to overshadow their familiarity with the underlying compelling storyline and arresting cinematography.Long story short: a drug dealer's (Dan Stevens) wife has been kidnapped and chopped into bits and pieces only to be nauseatingly dispersed in a park's pond. The remainder of the narrative-about 25 minutes in-sees Scudder investigating and following the cunning tracks of two alarming killers. In that regard, the killers (David Harbour and Adam David Thompson) make for incredibly creepy villains, mirthfully indulging in the rape of young girls and innocent wives while videotaping the horror and asking for a substantial ransom from their respective families. Alas, the audience will be forced through disturbingly shot and edited sequences of helpless women exerting to lie still as execrable hands scale their flesh-close-ups of wide eyes and deathly pale skin.On another note, many have been complaining that A Walk among the Tombstones isn't exactly the unpredictable and fast-paced mystery thriller they were expecting. However, that doesn't deem it a bad film, does it? Because it's clearly not attempting to (generically) fall into that category. Initially, I was also flabbergasted and immensely underwhelmed by David Fincher's Zodiac, presuming it to be a tense, brisk thriller; nevertheless, after a repeat viewing, I quickly realized that marketing-while, yes, manipulating audience expectations- shouldn't be an indicator of actual quality. If this particular movie was striving to be unpredictable yet you correctly predicted every single twist long before it came, then yes, it would've been a disastrous failure. Like Zodiac though, the movie is more about the grim and eerie atmosphere and, of course, the psychopathic killers themselves.Aside from a few effectively humorous lines, this film is not the typical ""crowd-pleaser expected from a post-Taken Liam Neeson picture, and the trailers clearly established that too. With that being said, it's still more exciting than a slow burn. As long as moviegoers accept its (effectual) dark aura and are successfully frightened by its imagery and subject matter, A Walk among the Tombstones will be a highly satisfying experience at the cinema. In fact, judging by its underwhelming box office results, I will even go so far as to say it might be the sleeper hit of this fall like Rush and Don Jon were last September.",A Walk Among the Tombstones
121,douglasmcbroom,"I Will Find You, And Perhaps Myself",7,18 August 2021,"This film is far superior to Liam Neeson's most recent, 'The Ice Road', which I rated a 1 and reviewed here on IMDB. Neeson is back in 'Taken' form, with a good, taught story, from the Lawrence Block novel of the same name, and sharp direction from Scott Frank. Filmed on location in NYC, and taking place between 1991 and 1999, this is a dark, suddenly violent, thriller that takes its time to build some character studies, as well as, the back story. Some respite from the darkness is provided by Astro, as 'TJ', who becomes a sort of partner to Neeson, who plays 'Matt Scudder,' a recurring character in 10 Block novels, and was previously played by Jeff Bridges in '8 Million Ways To Die.'The supporting cast is top notch, led by 'Narcos' Boyd Holbrook and 'Downton Abbey's' Dan Stevens.",A Walk Among the Tombstones
122,Sci-FiHorrorFan,A Captivating Mystery Thriller.,7,8 January 2015,"I liked this film and I don't understand the negative comments it's gotten,the film may not be totally original but what film is now a days? I mean come on you have to be fair. I found this film interesting and captivating and I think most people that didn't like it were expecting another TAKEN which it is Not so as a result they got annoyed about it. This is Not an Action film so if you are expecting to see a film like TAKEN you have come to the wrong movie. I thought this film did a good job with suspense and atmosphere and I also liked the directing and editing and I like the movies visual style. The films Kidnapping aspect may be similar to taken but the story is not and its done in a crime detective way with a good Performance from Liam Nesson. I quite enjoyed the films Dark style,the film felt gritty at times and I enjoyed that atmosphere. The story was simple and straight forward.A drug king pins wife gets kidnapped and he hires Liam Nesson who plays a private detective to find her. I found This film to be okay and I liked the story it's a film that is a bit of a slow burner,it's more about mystery and crime then Action and I found it interesting. Liam was very convincing as a detective and I think even if people don't like the slow start of the film they will still be entertained by Liam Nesson because he's interesting to watch.I thought Liam was a cool character and I love how he takes no rubbish from the kidnappers in the film,he even says to one of them on the phone Do you want your money or do you want to be looking behind you for the rest of your worthless Life!.I thought that was a cool scene and I liked how Liam spoke to the kidnappers like they were Nothing I found that funny. I thought Liams detective work was interesting,and he was good at finding evidence and figuring things out.he plays more of a clever character in this film where as in his other films he's more of a Badass,but I still liked his character in this film I thought he was cool and I liked how he stood up to the kidnappers and showed them he was not scared of them,that was fun to watch. All in all I thought this was an okay Film,it was a bit slow at first but it started to get interesting when Liam starts investigating,and I also enjoyed the Ending When Liam Has a Final Showdown with the bad guys,and he Kicks ass and Takes Names as always which was fun to watch. Overall I found this to be a cool suspenseful Dark mystery thriller Definitely Worth a Watch.",A Walk Among the Tombstones

125,bravesfanc,Neeson carries the movie,6,6 January 2015,"Lately, Liam Neeson is the go to guy for action/thrillers. Last year he had this film along with ""Nonstop"" and this coming Friday, ""Taken 3"" hits theaters for yet another dose of Liam Neeson. This film is to be released on Bluray and DVD next week.Based on a series of books, Neeson plays a retired cop who does ""favors"" for people as an undercover detective. I personally haven't read the books so I had no idea what to expect. In the movie, he is sought out to help a husband whose wife was brutally murdered.As he begins to look for clues, he finds old murders of similarity. The story picks up at this point and we learn more about Neeson's character and why he retired at such a young age.To nit pick for a second, there was a lot of phone conversations that reminded me a little too much of ""Taken"", as well as more than enough cliché's for a crime/thriller. I did like the dark tone of the film and a couple one liners delivered by Neeson. It's not action packed with only 2 gun shoot outs that last maybe 30 seconds a piece. I enjoyed the movie for what it was, but without Neeson I probably don't even watch it.",A Walk Among the Tombstones
126,vistheindian,Non-guns-blazing badass,6,10 November 2014,"Quickie Review:An ex-cop Matthew Scudder (Liam Neeson) is hired by a drug dealer to investigate into the murder of his wife. After reluctantly accepting the job, Matthew's investigation leads to linking several other serial killings. The journey he takes not only uncovers the truth behind the murders but also the past regrets that has haunted him. Liam Neeson is a name that is bound to attract an audience. Even if the movie is bad, we know at least he will deliver. It is important to understand that this is not an action movie, but a serious crime- drama. So if that's what you are looking for, you will find the movie to be fairly satisfying. If not, then you may need to watch Taken several times to get over your disappointment.Full Review:Who doesn't love Liam Neeson, honestly? Everyone loves him, so that was reason enough for me to go watch A Walk Among the Tombstones. I didn't know much in terms of the story, but I expected it to be a bit more serious than the recent action movies Neeson has been doing. What surprised me was how high the level of seriousness was.Taken 1 & 2, Non-Stop, The Grey, Unknown, etc. have all somewhat cumulated to associate Neeson with action. It's has almost become a running joke with a number of internet memes and imitations. It is out of love for Neeson's badassery that these jokes persist, so it's not exactly a bad thing. Though, it has run him into the risk of being type casted as action hero. In this movie however, he plays a more dramatic character which is refreshing to see. Actually he is the strongest part of the movie and likable enough to care about his story arc. Also the young actor Brian Bradley was a pleasant surprise. He plays an abandoned teenager called TJ, who doesn't like to be dependent on anyone. Over time Matthew and he became friends, and their interactions together are some of the best parts of the movie.The biggest problem I believe this film will face is the audience expectation for heavy amounts of action. Let me be clear, 99% of the movie has no over the top action or gunfights. This a completely realistic take on a criminal investigation. While that is fine, viewers with different hopes will definitely be disappointed. On top of that I think the movie suffers from taking itself too seriously. Look, I get it, this is supposed to be more dramatic, but it doesn't need to be bogged down with the gloominess of death and murder constantly. The only hint of escaping this trap were in the scenes between Matthew and TJ because of their more friendly light hearted chemistry. The rest of the cast is so one note, like ""oh look I always have a slight crinkle in my brow because this is serious and I am angry,"" that it becomes exhausting near the end. The story even is by the books, creeps who go around in a van abducting and killing women, we have seen that plot numerous times. Adding overly dramatic weight doesn't better the movie or make it special.In the end be cautious of what you want out of this movie. If you want popcorn action flick – must avoid. If you want a slow burning crime movie – give it a shot. Despite the unoriginal story, Liam Neeson is still great in A Walk Among the Tombstones. I wouldn't say run out and buy a ticket now, but if you happen to catch on TV or see it on Netflix, it's not a bad time.Check out more on my movie review blog The Stub Collector: http://thestubcollector.wordpress.com/",A Walk Among the Tombstones
127,CowherPowerForever,Liam Neeson - The Detective,8,20 September 2014,"This is a completely different type of Liam Neeson movie for the most part. If you want action like in the Taken franchise, you are not going to get it at all in this film. This film needs to be appreciated as a slow moving piece by piece detective story. The film has fantastic acting that carries the film from start to finish. This is my review of A Walk Among The Tombstones.The film was written for the screen by Scott Frank, and is based on the novel(of the same name) written by Lawrence Block. While I never read the book this film is based on, I am now very interested in picking up a copy. Scott Frank is recently known for The Wolverine and also wrote the 2002 smash hit Minority Report. As I said in my opening paragraph, this is more of a slow moving film than what we are use to seeing in a Liam Neeson movie. This is a detective story first and foremost. The film moves slowly along as we find out pieces of Matt Scudder's(played by Liam Neeson) past. The story also follows along nicely in this regard. Scudder is now an unlicensed private detective that takes cases here and there. When the wife of a man is brutally murdered, he decides he will look into the case. The case unlocks a few twists and turns along the way to keep the story interesting. The story is not perfect as there are a couple cliché moments here and there that bring the film down a sliver. Overall, Scott Frank delivers a very nice adaptation of what if suppose to be a very good book. I'm not sure how much of the book was changed for the big screen but, Frank's effort here delivers a great movie that most should enjoy if you are into a good detective story.The film was also directed by Scott Frank, which is good as he is able to deliver his vision of the film without being pressed by another writer. The film is very dark in nature, and it almost feels like a horror movie at times. It can easily be said this film is a thriller as well. There are many darker shot scenes that brings out the madness of the story and some of the characters. As I mentioned above, the action in this film is very light. We get a minor gun shooting scene early in the film but, that ends fairly quickly. There is some minor hand to hand combat in places throughout the film, mostly at the end, but nothing that we are use to seeing in a Liam Neeson action movie(which this not an action movie for the record). Going into the film I read a few reviews saying this is another Liam Neeson Taken movie. That is simply not the case at all. Neeson has one distinct moment in the film for me that could be chalked up near Taken but, that is it. The secondary actors in this film deliver some great performances as well. My only real complaint for the acting was Scudder's(Neeson) accident kept falling in and out. A professional like Neeson should have caught that mistake, and so should have Scott Frank. Overall, once again Frank deserves a great deal of credit for not only writing this great film but, also directing. There are a few minor problems I have with the film, nothing that brings the film down to a bad or even average grade though. This is a very enjoyable movie and Scott Frank does a fantastic job bringing his vision of this story to the big screen.Carlos Rafael Rivera is the composer of this film. This is his first major outing as the composer of a film(which shocked me to find that out). After watching this film you could have sworn that Rivera has composed scores before, or as least on a regular basis. His effort in this film is simply amazing. As I said above I felt some thriller aspects in this film. Rivera score really brings out that element I spoke of. You even at some points of the score get a Halloween vibe to it. Not in a cheesy way either. This score adds so much depth to the film, and just makes it even better. Easily one of the best scores in recent memory for me.In closing, if you are in the mood for a great detective story that will grip you from the start to the finish, then this movie is for you. If you were expecting another Liam Neeson movie that is filled with action, don't even bother buying a ticket unless you can lower your standards. This film needs to be viewed as a detective and story driven film, and not a film of the Taken series. If you understand that going into the theater, I believe you will very much enjoy this film.8/10",A Walk Among the Tombstones
128,rawiri42,Neeson is getting type cast.,6,6 November 2014,"A Walk Among the Tombstones is yet another Liam Neeson-as-you-might- expect-him effort where he portrays a good-guy/bad-guy character. Basically he is on the side of right but his methodology is far from ""orthodox"" (shall we say?) However - and this is where the film has its appeal - when viewers see what low-lifes Neeson is up against, they are virtually bound to take his side in spite of his unorthodoxy.There isn't really much that can be said about this movie without actually telling the story and introducing spoilers (which I rarely like to do as it seems pointless). The fact that Scudder (Neeson's character) is a bit of a renegade ex-cop allows him the liberty to do things that he would not be able to do were he still bound by police protocols and so the story tends to center around that where, for example, he (OK, somewhat reluctantly at first) ""overlooks"" his client's profession as a drug lord to find solutions to the drug lord's wife's murder by a pair of total psychopaths.Unfortunately, as with many such movies, the key protagonist seems to walk away at the end with apparently no police interest in him and that always disturbs me. Is it a reflection of American police ineptitude or just something movie-watchers have to accept?",A Walk Among the Tombstones
129,donb-519-335075,Better than the Taken Series,8,25 February 2015,"Liam Neeson finally plays a role he could actually carry off. I expected much of the same role he played in Taken. Surprisingly this film shows him in a real detective role - doing the tracing of the crime - the research - putting the story together. There is some action - pretty believable where he fights one bad guy and barely is able to cope. Not at all like his previous scenes in the Taken series where he walks into a kitchen loaded with armed bad guys and he takes them all out in 10 seconds. I admit I loved that scene in Taken 1 just because he is so bad ass - but believable? - no. The story and the plot are excellent in this movie:Two psychos are kidnapping - receiving ransom - and then killing young wives. They pick on drug lords as they cannot go to the police. But Liam is a ex-cop/alcoholic (reformed) and he knows how to handle such situations.By the second kidnapping he puts the bad guys on the defensive and arranges for a face-to-face exchange - and the story goes to crap for the bad guys from that point on. Most of the violence is off screen, which, as we know makes it much more vivid and menacing, until the ending sequence. The two psychos are great in their roles - ruthless - focused on ravaging their victims - getting the thrill of the kill - while also making a lot of money. The movie tries, not very successfully, to draw the 12 steps alcoholics take into the drama and his thinking process. All in all, this is the best of the Liam Neeson ""action"" movies. The story is pretty tight, although the drug dealers are not nearly as confident or competent as they are usually portrayed - which is probably more to real life. (They can't all be Walter Whites.)My recommendation is rent ""Walk"" - well worth the time.If you really want to see Liam at his best - rent Rob Roy.",A Walk Among the Tombstones
130,YJLcool,"Aside from Liam Neeson's performance, there's nothing much to see here",6,26 September 2014,"Here we go again...another crime thriller about girls being taken and Liam Neeson needs to go find the perpetrators before it's too late. However, it's different this time around compared with other past successes such as Taken or Non-Stop. The plot of the film is too straightforward and obvious, with no surprises or plot twists along the way, which makes it a boring film to begin with. The film's slow pace makes it even more difficult to sustain the viewer's interest. Not to mention, there's less action in the film this time as well.Based on the 1992 novel of the same name by Lawrence Block, A Walk Among The Tombstones is about an unlicensed private detective, Scudder (also an ex-cop and recovering alcoholic) who's hired by a drug trafficker to hunt down the serial killers/kidnappers who brutally murdered his wife. During his investigation, Scudder slowly learns that these cruel men have committed similar crimes in the past but remain unpunished by law.Once again, Liam Neeson is at his best and fits the character perfectly with his usual calm and cool yet resolute demeanour on screen. We get to see some 'Taken-style' scenes as he speaks authoritatively with the villains on phone, forcing them to comply his demands. Unfortunately, the script for A Walk Among the Tombstones is just too dull and lacklustre for any one actor to carry.There are no catchy or memorable punchlines he can deliver aside from his performance. His sidekick character, TJ (yes, he got one this time) seems out of place and feels rather unnecessary for the overall plot. There's no development for the villains that Scudder is looking for in the film either. The film shows how scary and vile they can be, but we don't know them. We don't know who they are, where they come from or what their ulterior motives are.There are a few plot contrivances, along with some dialogue and situational cliché's as well. Because there are no sudden plot twists or classic third act reveal on the villains, you don't really need to 'walk' along with Scudder to find and see the clues to unravel the mystery. You're just waiting for them to finally meet face to face in the end instead. The film spends most of its time saying what, when and how it's going to do, but it never says why. Because of this, it loses its meaning along the way.Overall, it's a miss. If you wish to watch Liam Neeson as a lone- wolf action hero, I would highly recommend anyone to watch Taken or Non- Stop again instead. It's far better and exciting compared with this one.http://yjcool.blogspot.com/2014/09/movie-review-walk-among- tombstones.html Rating: 5.5/10",A Walk Among the Tombstones
131,moviescoundrel,A work not worth taking,7,25 September 2014,"Wasn't sure quite what to expect here. Really wanted something gritty and edgy. It was a tad disturbing at times, but not really so gritty or edgy. Neeson as a detective who has messed up in life numerous times seems to have a second chance at some relationships and solving a case that is more than meets the eye. We are first introduced to Matt Scudder (Neeson) when he is a police officer in the 90's. He is an alcoholic, apparently has a family (which we really learn nothing about) and stops some assailants but not without consequence. We don't really learn the full effect of the consequence until later, and honestly it didn't really help the story at all, but nevertheless. I could care less about most of the supporting cast, and about the relationships. The antagonists are quite interesting but in my opinion we don't get enough of them and they don't really come into focus until the last quarter of the movie. While a noble attempt at a slightly different perspective of the basic mystery genre, there wasn't enough mystery, suspense, action, or character development here. Maybe more relevant characters or actors would have helped.",A Walk Among the Tombstones
132,georgecoffeynewyorker,"A bit gory, Plot unstructured",7,26 September 2014,"Well what to say about this particular, to be of quite interest. I was most intrigued with the plot. For once, I was able to get the plot. However half way through, I was like whats going on. I found the characters to be of MOST confusing. I was left, who is who. Why is he there etc., etc., Like why did the killers kill each other, etc., etc., The plot simply put Matt(Neeson) an ex cop, goes into Private Investigation in the Unlicensed sense, and is tasked by Kenny(Stevens) to find his wife, who is brutally we later learn has been murdered n dismembered. Some scenes(not much) were a bit disturbing I have to say. Kenny wants Matt ""to bring them to me"". The film was enticed around kidnapping and dismembering of women. During the investigation, Matt befriended(Kinda strong a word - hahaha) with a grave cleaner guy. Fearing for his life, he kills himself by way of jumping off the building. As he had given information the viewer was treated to even more insight and as such some of the disturbing viewing as I said above. We then learn of how Matt became an unlicensed PI(Private Investigator) which we actually learn. It so happens because he actually missed a shot and shot an innocent girl in the eye from a distance of which is another scene we didn't need to see. Which frankly I don't understand. Technically if you leave the job or ur fired, why become an UNLICENSED PI, either apply for another job or a different field or don't bother. Don't get urself in a life of crime sort of thing. At the beginning of the film, we are treated to Matt as a LICENSED PI. He's sitting peacefully in a bar having 2 shots and a coffee. Then the barman is shot, Matt himself gets a fright like us all, haahah. This possibly is how is alcoholism started as throughout the film, we see Matt attending meetings. The main villains that we see in the film, have their faces hidden(well in the dark) and are seen driving around for women. Matt meets a young inspirational man who advertises VEGETARIANISM and possibly VEGANISM as when he;s asked in a restaurant with Matt, if he'd like a soda, TJ(Astro) tells the waitress that he'd like water, as there isn't extra stuff and ingredients etc., So Matt comes in contact with the two guys. Then a fight ensues between Matt, Kenny and the killers: Ray(Harbour) and Albert(Thompson).",A Walk Among the Tombstones
133,vandelour,Worth It,7,20 November 2014,"I'm torn between a 7 and an 8 for this movie but decided to go conservative. Its a solid 7. Very solid. A crime thriller, Liam Neeson is the lead and the orbiting actors give him excellent support in a story that isn't exactly a puzzle but more of a beat the clock thing. Good film work, excellent sound, a good script and edit make this a film to watch, not just sit in your theater seat and worry about the parking meter outside. Character development is believable, dramatic situations are within reason and the outcome is a sum of the parts. No what-the-hell-just- happened faces are gonna walk out of the theater with this one. After having just seen Interstellar a couple days ago, its great to see a movie that can stand on its own without having to pump up the marketing machine of a 'blockbuster' to conceal the glaring flaws but then I've always been partial to good tight flicks without any great point to them other than to give the audience a good ride.",A Walk Among the Tombstones
134,210west,Repellent non-mystery about sadistic psychopaths who kidnap women & cut them up,4,9 October 2014,"Liam Neeson seems to be getting good press here on IMDb, even among those who (wisely, I think) were dismissive of this movie. Well, he's certainly the best thing about it; he has a certain air of integrity and physical self-confidence that makes you feel, when he's on screen, that you're in capable hands. I would also single out for praise (a) an actor named Ólafur Darri Ólafsson, who plays an interestingly eccentric, morally compromised minor character (albeit an extremely implausible one who spills the beans way too readily and then proceeds to, rather predictably, off himself -- also way too readily); (b) the action-packed shoot-em-up scene that opens the movie; (c) a chilling little scene midway through, in which one of the psycho heavies, played by Adam David Thompson, tinkers in a calm, preoccupied manner with his collection of torture/bondage/dismemberment tools; and (d) the authentic-feeling NYC setting.Other than those small virtues, the film was pretty repellent, and I think the less of anyone who could praise it. I mean, consider: The movie's villains are a pair of sadists who kidnap women, torture them, cut them up in little pieces -- and then kidnap a 14-year-old girl walking her dog. How much grisly, gratuitous, over-the-top cruelty does a movie really need to hold your attention? A film professor once observed that it's EASY to get an audience to sit up in their seats, hearts pounding, if you show the hero and villain fighting on the edge of a precipice. That doesn't take much directorial skill (though God knows it can still be done beautifully, as in ""The Last of the Mohicans""). But if you can generate suspense while simply depicting a civilized couple chatting in a Venetian hotel room (I'm thinking of ""Betrayal""), then you've done something. I called the film a ""non-mystery,"" by the way, because the identities of its villains are revealed pretty early on, after which the story becomes a cat-and-mouse thriller rather than a mystery. These serial-killer types seem awfully familiar; maybe they're a bit less stereotyped in the Lawrence Block novel (which I have no interest in reading). They also come off, in what we see of them, as fiendishly clever in the beginning, but once our hero, Matt Scudder, gets embroiled in the case, they suddenly and conveniently grow sloppy. They've already acquired hundreds of thousands of dollars in cash, but then, like desperate amateurs, they break their rules, change their m.o., and take absurd risks in allowing a face-to-face meeting with Scudder for the transfer of the ransom money and the freeing of the victim. In fact, the two of them suddenly seem downright inept. And so is the direction, at this point, because the film ends with two ""climaxes,"" both of them confusing (they're filmed in the dark), annoying (bad guy #2 conveniently murders bad guy #1, so that Scudder has just one guy to contend with), and, well, anticlimactic.Further annoyance: Scudder's tiresome, fakey little ghetto-kid sidekick, who possesses the sort of improbable genius IQ and wise-cracking wisdom found only in Hollywood movies. (Remember the brainy-as-Google ghetto kid in ""Finding Forrester,"" that sentimental tripe starring Sean Connery?)Still further annoyance: lots of cutting to scenes of assorted AA meetings -- nothing is more boring than an AA meeting, except maybe to the people talking -- followed, at the end, by a voice-over reciting some of the Twelve Steps as Scudder prepares to confront his foe. It feels like a sanctimonious, contrived attempt to give this trashy film some moral stature.I feel bad for all the cast members; they worked hard, and they deserve to have their names attached to a less sordid, more respectable movie. I feel especially bad for a young actress named Danielle Rose Russell, who plays the teenage kidnapping victim. She's a cute young girl, undoubtedly with career aspirations, and this was apparently her first movie. I hope her next one's a step up.",A Walk Among the Tombstones
135,sickofenjoyingmyself,Mysterious Private Eye Noir,8,1 April 2015,"This private investigator noir thriller has a an old school feel to it. It does seem to be a storyline that has been re worked countless times - loner older PI, reformed character, inner demons from a dark past that have led him to become an obsessive workaholic trying to make amends for previous mistakes. Unusual sidekick. Having said that, I really like the way this movie was shot. Although many parts of the old school PI story line felt slightly rehashed - it was also suspenseful, chilling and engrossing. Liam Neeson was enjoyable to watch in a role he is perfect for - the hardened, no nonsense type. David Harbour was particularly chilling in his role. Although Brian Bradley as TJ seemed to be a reasonable enough actor I did feel that the blossoming partnership between this character and Matt Scudder was unnecessary and lacked real credibility. The sense of private detective noir gave the bleak and gloomy setting an almost comforting quality at times. Having seen the trailer I was really looking forward to watching it and having now viewed it I don't feel let down at all. It knows what it is and it's really enjoyable to watch.",A Walk Among the Tombstones
136,DJ_Shilo,A Walk in New York City,5,16 October 2018,"Liam Neeson is an old dog that loves to fetch the same old. At this point, I could care less what's next for him because this picture was an excuse just for him to be another drunken wreck who's trying to redeem himself something stupid he has done. I could have sworn I saw this last spring with ""Non-Stop."" ""Taken 3"" is his next film, that should say it all. The last two weren't great so what makes him think we need a third installment? Anyway, ""A Walk Among the Tombstones"" is based on a book by Lawrence Block.It's about a retired cop, Matthew Scudder (Liam Neeson), who had an accident on the job and is now an unlicensed private detective working in New York City. When a drug kingpin asks him for his help to find two men who have murdered his wife, Matthew accepts the offer and begins investigating. What he uncovers is a murder mystery that will take him from one end of New York to the other.Liam Neeson is starting to lose himself in these tough-guy roles. We have seen this before in ""Taken"" and ""Taken 2"". He's not a bad actor, he just plays the same characters with a different name and its tiring. He gives an okay performance in this picture as a burnt out alcoholic with a sad past, but these alcoholic roles are starting to become a drag. Ex-police, ex-DEA, and ex-Military, they all seem to be burnt-out drunks after their service, and it's getting stale for these kinds of pictures. Liam is not the only actor that plays these roles, but he is the one who shows up the most with them.Neeson is the least of the problems this picture faces. Several scenes make no sense and give no explanation. There is a sequence where a guy walks merely off a roof in the middle of a conversation, for no apparent reason. There is a sequence near the end where someone is given a choice, Why? And then a character leaves, but for some unknown reason, he returns. It's almost like only this character could finish the movie so why have him go and return? Here's the most stupid thing, the killers are two morons who steal wives and daughters from wealthy drug dealers because they have money to pay. They're two ex-DEA agents who, for some reason, are insane and we never learn why.The movie opens, and we see Matthew Scudder is having a dreadful day and sitting in a bar in 1991. After a brutal firefight, the film moves to its present day in 1999 where Scudder is apparently sober. He is a private dick and called to accept a case from a wealthy drug dealer. Matthew agrees with the offer, and from here the film falls apart. Things flare up when body parts appear in bags in the back of a trunk and Matthew is pulled into the case. It kind of feels like one super long episode of Televisions ""Law & Order."" It's grim and dark throughout, but it's not difficult to figure the movie out in the first half hour. By the second act, we know how it's going to end.None of the characters of the picture make sense. There is a sequence in the second act where Matthew is talking to a suspect, and for some unexplained reason, he walks off the roof of the building in the middle of a speech. Is he scared of someone? It almost feels like something supernatural is happening here but this picture is just a crime thriller. We never learn anything about this, and it acts like this character never existed after we see his body. Another aspect is a punk kid, TJ (Brian ""Astro"" Bradley) who apparently becomes Matthew's assistance. They meet in a library and after a short conversation is working together on a murder investigation.You can figure out how it ends. The ending is stupidly put together and messy, and It makes no sense when Matthew figures out where the sickos are and he arrives at a house where they have been hiding in a basement. He walks into the basement then walks out of the house. After everyone has been attacked, Matt shows up guns blazing. Why did he leave? You can figure out which character it is, and you can figure out how it ends. This could've been a much better picture because it is a crime thriller. It's not so much Liam that is the problem, it's the structure and screenplay to the movie are botched, and it comes off as a complete mess.",A Walk Among the Tombstones

The story is superficial and empty, but constantly pretends to be deep and meaningful.Everybody is full of *bleep*, talking, walking, thinking out of character. The bad guys are perverts but they look and act like average bad guys in a normal gangster type movie. Actually, the movie should be a drug flick, but someone spilled a can marked ""sicko pervert serial killers"" into it.Liam Neeson looks very much the part of the guy who can take care of things, confident, experienced, relaxed, heavy-fisted, but they make him do evil things. Things like take a little wise-guy boy under his protection for no good reason or talk utter nonsense at an AA meeting. Such a pity to put this quality guy into such cheap cheap surroundings.

138,waterman1976,A decent story of a true PI,6,23 December 2020,"Liam Neeson in a dark PI story is entertaining to watch. The voiceover that sometimes pops up is great and adds to the suspense and apparent loneliness of Neeson. For me, the movie misses some elements that pull the viewer into the story.

Not the best movie that Neeson chose, but certainly a watch worthwile.",A Walk Among the Tombstones
139,Zulfmanauthor,Tightly-wound thriller !,10,9 April 2015,"Liam Neeson stars in his most familiar role, portraying a hard nosed uncompromising man who wages a one man war against the bad guys. Yet it's not Liam Neeson's reliably good performance which makes this film what it is but it is the excellent script and direction that makes 'Tombstones' one of the most tightly wound thrillers you will ever see. It reminded me of 'Prisoners' for the most part and also of 'Taken', but this film is different and so tense that it keeps you on the edge throughout. It's pace is just right allowing the viewer to slowly become involved in the mystery, living through each moment and being in despair as ex-detective Matt searches for the killers. This film is about the cut throat atmosphere and being based on a novel, it portrays each character so well giving them depth and meaning. Whereas 'Taken' was great but it's main strength was Liam Neeson's stellar performance yet here the film itself takes much of the credit and deserves a lot more acclaim than what it has received so far.",A Walk Among the Tombstones
140,ActionFan-Reviews,Don't Expect A Movie Like Taken,7,17 November 2014,"Upon first hearing of this film, I like many thought it would be a fast paced and action packed film. Unexpectedly, this movie is more like the late 90's thriller 8mm in terms of story and tone than it is some of Liam's recent films. The film much like 8mm, is a dark, tense and gripping thriller with more dramatic elements than action. Liam Neeson may seem like he is being typecast as of late, playing these burnt out, reluctant hero type characters with emotional baggage like alcoholism or family problems.These roles seem to resonate with many and he plays them with such ease and great acting ability that he is an ideal fit for these roles. Although Liam carries the film on his back, he is backed by a good supporting cast and characters. Particularly, the villainous duo who play they're roles as sadistic, creepy murderers very convincingly. Another standout supporting role comes from Liam's sidekick in the film, TJ. Both characters had good on screen chemistry and adds more to the movie and the character of Matt Scudder. The director does a great job building a creepy, tense and dark atmosphere which leaves the viewer on the edge of their seat as they build to a nail biting climax. Overall, don't expect an action packed movie. Expect a more slow, dramatic thriller that plays like a detective/mystery novel and show's Liam Neeson is an actor first and an action star second.7/10",A Walk Among the Tombstones
141,Joseph_Gillis,Captures Much Of The Darkness of Scudder,6,28 June 2017,"The debut novel in Lawrence Block's Matthew Scudder series is arguably the darkest and most unrelentingly bleak of the countless private eye novels I've read, and although I haven't read the novel which this film is an adaptation of, I suspect director Franks has nailed its tone.The subject matter - of the executions by a pair of renegade ex-DEA agents of drug kingpin wives and, in the final case, child - and the graphic nature of the killings might suggest cheap thrills appealing to fans of such as 'Death Wish' and other vigilante-style films, but there's a dark intelligence here, even if the focus might suggest otherwise.Based on the Block novels I have read, it's fair to say that they vary wildly in quality - I would also say that his ex-crime-writing buddy, Donald E. Westlake has a higher strike-rate - but this is one instance where I would urge anybody who has recognised the intelligence at work to seek out the source novel, because I strongly suspect that considerable extra depth and value will be added by Scudder's interior monologues.I won't claim to be a huge Liam Neeson fan but although from my vague recall I suspect the Scudder of the novels is bulkier and more beaten down - perhaps Brian Dennehy at his peak might have been a better fit - Neeson is probably as good a fit as anybody now, given commercial dictates, and he does an adequate job here.I particularly liked the scenes with the park attendant, and the performance and look of the more talkative psycho, Ray. The drug 'trafficker' who hired Scudder had just enough believable 'humanity' about him to make him seem real, and a cut above the stereotype. Dan Stevens' performance was probably as good as anybody's, in the role. I liked the dark look of daytime New York, too: that's how I would have pictured it in 'Sins Of The Fathers', also. The young sometime-assistant was novel, I suppose, but I could have done without his lightness and frequently-tedious street, and classic PI-smarts. Perhaps this was another concession to commerce?I've read elsewhere that this ending fell considerably short of the novel's, which is a particular highlight. Which is a matter of some relief, also, as this ending - apart from the juxtaposed attendant AA recitation - looked just too familiar for me.6 might be too low, but 7 certainly too high. It's functionally done, but just too lean in its 'execution' to be even considered for ranking among the great crime films of the 21st Century. Perhaps a 6.5, or a 6.4 would be fairest rating, mainly for Lawrence Block and his creation.",A Walk Among the Tombstones
142,CharlieGreenCG,A Walk Among The Tombstones - Review,7,28 September 2014,"Liam Neeson has a very particular set of skills. A set of skills that he has acquired over a very long career  to mention a few, they include; playing a Jedi master, the trainer of Batman, almighty Zeus, and the iconic Oskar Schindler, but more recently the role of Bryan Mills in Taken. Which in terms of premise is very similar to 'A Walk Among The Tombstones', if not almost an unofficial instalment of the Taken franchise. Based on terms of quality it is among the same leagues, linking both darkness to intensity, resulting in a rather thrilling film.'A Walk Among The Tombstones' follows former NYC cop and private investigator Matthew Scudder, portrayed by Liam Neeson, who is hired by drug dealer Dan Stevens to find his kidnapped wife. Set in the shadowy scape of NYC, it is dark and melodramatic. In fact, if you mix Gone Baby Gone and Taken together then you would probably get this movie, it is entertaining, and even has a phone call moment like Taken, however not as iconic (or as cool).Based on the Matthew Scudder books (That Liam Neeson admitted to not even reading), a character formerly played by Jeff Bridges in the 1980's and that Harrison Ford was attached to for a long while before taken over by Neeson. Scudder is an interesting character with quite a deep past, which mixed with work of Academy-Award nominee Scott Frank at the helm of director and screenplay creates something admirable.Starring Liam Neeson as the lead, he now adds yet another exceptional character to his portfolio of sixty-three feature films. Co-starring Dan Stevens in an equally dark role the drama seems authentic and keeps you induced. Stevens formerly of TV's Downton Abbey has recently made a transition to film with so far two decent performances. Be sure to check out his film The Guest, also out this week - it is pretty good.After seeing the film we were fortunate enough to see Liam Neeson come on stage for a Q&A of the film. We won't go into much detail, but he was very cool and insightful. He stated that he was attracted to the film mainly because of 'the dark subject matter' and the 'poetic soul of the character'. Which going by his later performances which are similar seems to be very successful.Neeson went onto say it that it is quite agonising to watch himself in early films and learn from the poor performances. He then described the process of creating telephone scenes in his movies (it is every bit as interesting as you would think, and more). In closing he also spoke of his love for the Game Of Thrones TV-show, and his upcoming roles in Ted 2 (a cameo) and the motion-capture role of a tree.",A Walk Among the Tombstones

However I'm getting this feeling that Liam Neeson as a penchant for making phone call threats and seeking revenge in his trademark voice. This is fine for 1 movie, but seeing it a few times now (with this film too) makes it more repetitive than a washing machine.The moral of the story is that 2 psychotic killers are kidnapping drug dealer's wives/girlfriends and making sure they enjoy every bit of them. This was the only decent part of the story until they happen to ask Liam (a retired cop) for help and the entire movie collapses like a straw house in a blizzard. Instead of these drug dealers with supposedly large ties with criminal groups summoning a group of thugs to beat the crap out of these 2 criminals, they in- list the help of a retired, old and washed-up former cop to assist them as they appear to be completely helpless and at his mercy.Liam proceeds to do what he (thinks) does best, gets on the phone and starts with threats and blackmailing and the rest if historyi.e - one to skip",A Walk Among the Tombstones

Again, it seems as though Liam Neeson plays this role best. The down but not quite out good guy. Even worth the Taken franchise at an almost polar opposite, elementally,both main leads hold similar mind sets. In A Walk Among The Tombstones, this character is borderline, if not full on, alcoholic. Think, Run All Night, The Grey, and Nonstop. However, Neeson does pull it together long enough to realize that this crime isn't exactly new. He had retained enough memory, although viewed through an alcohol haze, to piece together the details of a current kidnapping with elements of a previous crime. Nothing new to see here folks, just keep on moving. Truly. While watching Neeson play through the character and script, blink and you may be in one of the above mentioned films.

I enjoy the notions of justice and retribution... but I can very easily get tired of 'gritty', 'grunty' heroes with a drink/drug/trauma back story.This film has all the requisite ingredients. And I mean... ALL of them. Pretty victims, grizzly relatives, a hero that makes Blade Runners Deckard look positively cheerful... and a young sidekick who gets lectured about all of life's ills.

This seemed better for the first ten minutes... but then went the same, sad and sorry way.I don't like moaning about films, I think they exist primarily to be enjoyed... but this was essentially, a long drawn out series of clichés that ended up confusing the simplest story ever told. Bad gets increasingly badder, good fights inner badness... and the emergent inner goodness... finally overcomes unforgivable badness. And that's how I like it... until writer gives up, Director tries to remake The Godfather... and all the actors appear to be improvising their way through the last ten minutes of Back To The Future 2.By the time the editing had successfully lost me... I no longer cared anyway. Just when Uncle Buck should have hit the guy with the golf ball... everyone got shot.

152,cosmicfish14,A Huge Surprise,7,20 September 2014,"First lets get to the beginning, when I first saw advertising for this movie I pretty much expected it to be Taken 3. But through movie plans going sour, we decided to watch this movie instead (since there wasn't anything else that looked interesting that was out right now.) But after watching this is, I was honestly surprised! This is actually an amazing movie (I might even consider it one of the best of the year so far.)One big reason I thought this was great was at first I thought it was just going to be a really dull action movie with little story or plot. Little did I know I got the exact opposite of that (Lots of story and plot with little action.) So the movie actually became a true detective type story.Also Liam Nesson was actually kinda good in this movie as well.Also the movie had a lot of great little details. Like the sound design in this movie was really good. It felt very crisp and accurate during the gunfights(which are probably about 3 of them.) Also this movie did very well with having some dramatic and serious parts but also have some humorous moments as well without feeling unnecessary. Also there were scenes where I actually felt real suspense, you don't see that in a major release nowadays do you.My only problems were that there were a few scenes that felt like they could have been cut from the movie. There were also some parts of the story they kinda glanced over as well. But all together this was an incredibly solid movie, and a huge surprise for me. 8/10",A Walk Among the Tombstones

Unlike the other same genre, this does not filled with action-packed scenes, but progresses steadily and methodically in details just like a real investigation in daily life, making it appears to be a chilling drama thriller. Not much of plot twists, but certain creepy moments with solid scores, riveting performance from the hero himself and the supporting casts, nasty and eerie crime heavily based on drugs and alcohol, the surprisingly ""muted"" ending style are more than enough to guarantee an intense, enjoyable, old-fashioned and watchable psycho- thriller.",A Walk Among the Tombstones

I need him to act in at least 5 movies per year so that the entertainment never ends! How is it possible that someone could be born a bad-ass? It seems innate! He is hot even when he is getting beaten up! I swear, if I ever meet him, I will be weak in the knees! In this movie, he believably played the role of a private eye with a conscience. He allowed a bunch of lames to disrespect him, because their opinions did not matter. Humility was key! He involuntarily became the mentor of a minority child and devoted his expertise towards innocent members of families. I love Liam being the hero. A villain role simple wouldn't suit him. P.S.

156,victuki,Tombs for the living,7,2 October 2014,"Scott Frank is a filmmaker and screenwriter, responsible for titles like ""The Lookout"" (2007), which he directed as well, or ""The Interpreter"" (Sydney Pollack, 2005). This film, based on the Lawrence Block novels, deals with kidnappings, drug lords and tortured souls. This is a dense film, a classic mystery story, and to me, its gritty style just relate it to ""8MM"" (Joel Schumacher, 1999). Frank delivers a solid piece of screenplay and a driven filmmaking.Liam Neeson is Matt Scuder, an ex-cop now working as a private investigator. A woman has been kidnapped and murdered. Her husband had paid the ransom money, yet they killed her anyway. She is one of many that has suffered the same fate. Scuder is determined to find out what there is behind all of this. Neeson is just a master of acting (I know, I am a crazy fan, so what?). his voice and presence just fill the screen, and he barely needs anything or anyone else to keep the show running. This film though, is more about how the events turn out more than characters themselves.The look of the film (one scene in the opening credits is as beautiful as it is disturbing) is harsh, and the soundtrack is kind of minimalist, but it certainly works in every moment; To me there is only one thing I did not like: It could have been more disturbing and rough and still keep the mystery, but it is also true the ending is not disappointing at all. There is no fantastic approach to the story, not clichés around, just tormented souls and tombstones for the living, where we have a walk.",A Walk Among the Tombstones
157,Drive-in_Zeppelin,Liam 'Insert obligatory threatening phone-call scene' Neeson,5,4 October 2014,"Liam Neeson is back in his gruff everyman-turned-action-hero role as former cop Matt Scudder. He's supposedly something akin to a private eye, though you'd never know if you knew anything about the detective genre. He's hired by some guy, whose character I completely forgot because it didn't seem at all important, to find the kidnappers that murdered his wife and to extract revenge upon them. Now you're probably thinking, 'Hey, you said FORMER cop'. That must mean something happened to him to make him leave the force! Correct you are as always dear reader, as PI Scudder happened to be in a bar one day when a group of men came in and shot the bartender. Scudder chased them, killed most of them, and accidentally killed a little girl with a ricocheted bullet in the process. (This is where the clichés begin) We're naturally expected to perceive him as the hard-boiled hero of noir who drinks heavily in the middle of the day and shoots people in the face without regard to procedure or apparent danger, but there are no wise-cracking detectives in this film I'm afraid. The story then starts to pander as he apparently has blamed his 'rampant' alcoholism for the mistake, subsequently becoming a devout follower of the 12 step AA process and staying sober for going on 8 years. This is the part that bothers me because there is an implied theme of addiction throughout the film, though we never actually see him challenged with the presence of a bottle or in any way revert to his previous 'uncontrolled' self. We see a junkie that can't seem to stay clean, and it's implied that the murderers derive some sick pleasure from kidnap and torture, but that's the end of the whole 'confronting your demons' thing. Anyways, that's basically the story. Liam Neeson does his Mickey Mouse investigating and tries to catch the bad guys. At one point he teams up with a homeless kid that fancies himself the next Phillip Marlowe or Sam Spade (as the kid is an apparent fan of crime fiction), and the mystery is afoot! The mystery in this case is why on Earth the kid and his fascination with detectives and comic artistry are even brought up in the first place. They have no bearing on the story other than to cut to the chase at the ending and get to the final confrontation. Remind you of another Liam Neeson movie where he has to accompany an annoying kid to solve a mystery? If not I suggest you watch the Red Letter Media review of The Phantom Menace. Also congratulations to Scott Frank on getting the point across that the movie was set in 1999. I wasn't sure what with all the Y2K references, the Twin Towers having attention drawn to them, or the Backstreet Boys Millennium poster on the wall. At first I thought this was meant as some gimmick to create a retro-crime thriller, but no, it serves absolutely no purpose and just becomes distracting as the film goes on. I honestly think Liam Neeson is capable of decent performances. I think he's a pretty cool guy that started out working as forklift driver for the Guinness brewery and who was also an amateur boxer. That being said, I also believe that he stars in terrible movies far too frequently and that the attempts to copy Taken need to stop. Anyone seen Darkman lately? How about the more recent Wrath of the Titans? I'll save you the trouble, they're painful to watch. I cannot in good conscious ever recommend something as dull as this movie, nor do I think it'd even be worth the time in a Netflix binge.Read this and other reviews on the DriveInZeppelin website",A Walk Among the Tombstones
158,KenLiversausage,Walking in the shadows of Chandler and Hammett,8,24 September 2014,"Lawrence Block has proved himself a worthy successor to the holy trinity of American crime novelists, Raymond Chandler, Dashiel Hammett and James M Cain. Block's Matt Scudder almost inevitably shares a number of qualities and characteristics with his antecedents Philip Marlowe and Sam Spade - both namechecked here in AWATT; but while he's certainly no Bogart, Liam Neeson proves himself more than worthy of the task of at last bringing Block's anti-hero detective to the screen (let's ignore Jeff Bridges' misfire in 8 Million Ways to Die - everyone else did).In AWATT, writer-director Scott Frank, erasing - for good, one hopes - the aberrant stain on his CV that was Marley and Me, delivers a dark, bleak thriller whose fuse burns too slowly for the peanut-brained generation MTV, but which will prove richly satisfying to grown-up noir movie fans.The supporting cast is uniformly excellent. I'll never be able to watch re-runs of Downton Abbey in quite the same light after seeing Dan Stevens' transformative turn here as a bereaved and vengeful drug dealer. And we'll surely be seeing a lot more of 'Astro' Brian Bradley, who has instantly become indispensable as Scudder's informal sidekick TJ.Admittedly the plot is as straightforward as Chandler's were complex. But as Chandler himself ultimately showed, plot can and perhaps should be secondary to character, atmosphere and style in this genre - qualities A Walk Among the Tombstones has in (Sam) spades. Indeed, where AWATT really scores is in its pervading aura of menace, of gloom, of doom even. Adam Sandler it ain't, and thank the Lord - and Scott Frank, the movie's producers and its studio backers - for that.So the psychos' motivation is never spelled out? That's good, I say. The scariest kind of bad guys are often the ones with zero back-story - evil needs no explanation or justification; it just is.Block purists might query the faithfulness of Scott Frank's adaptation of the source novel - the ending sexes up Scudder's action-hero credentials, for obvious commercial reasons. (Read the full Scudder canon and you'll be surprised - and not a tad frustrated - at how low-key the endings can be.) But for this hardcore Lawrence Block fan at least, A Walk Among the Tombstones is about as much as I could have hoped for from an industry now largely geared up to produce CGI-drenched pabulum. Not a great movie, but a very good one.",A Walk Among the Tombstones

161,Vondaz,Pointless,4,20 September 2014,"I went into see this movie with absolutely no background knowledge of what it was about or understanding that it was based on a series of stories. Had I been aware of this I might have saved myself the money and the time.It's not that it wasn't acted well by Neeson or shot/directed well. It was other things that bothered me: the signposts to Y2K - of what relevance was that to the story? In fact what was the purpose of setting it in the late 90s? To show us how life used to be before the internet and mobile phones took over our lives?If so, then fine make that point, but give it some relevance to the story. the 12 steps - of what relevance was that to the story? In fact (i) it was shot in such a way that the scenes distracted me and I can't remember any of them and (ii) I don't recall our hero carrying out any of them himself. the clichéd drunk cop goes clean to redeem himself. TBH we never see him struggle with temptation for a drink, so maybe it wasn't enough of a sacrifice to give any redemption? the clichéd smart-alec kid from the streets - he's street tough, but vulnerable, he's techno smart, but can't carry out a simple instruction. In fact why would any script writer worth their salt allow the line ""stay in the car""? the clichéd climactic fight scene - why was the killer waiting for our hero to return? He'd already heard him say he was going. So why set up the elaborate body positioning in the hope he would return?At the end I just went ""meh"" and walked out without any sense of satisfaction.

162,film316-125-427677,Taken To The Grave,6,30 November 2014,"It's amazing to me, how we can treat Liam Neeson and not feel guilty. Here is a man who has made many, many films in his lifetime (lest we forget he was Oscar Shindler) yet we remember him for one somewhat ridiculous role in Taken. We should come to the realisation that actors are people and they are in the business to make money. Neeson is a man who has paid his dues, he has made independent little films, he has done art house and now he is an action hero. I just wonder if we would be as harsh as people are to Neeson to someone like Bruce Willis, so for this review I will be looking at Liam Neeson from a completely impartial perspective.A Walk Among The Tombstones is a compacted thriller, in the first 10 minutes all of it's ideas are laid out on the table and for the most part they never really change. This isn't a film with twists and turns and it isn't ambitious, but then does it really have to be? Why can't a movie just be serviceable? Why can't a film give you an outline of a story, with the hints of more to it, a handful of characters and a situation for them to cope with? Adequate, that's how I would describe A Walk Among The Tombstones, it's never reaching too high and it's never stooping too low, the film is just happy to ride the middle of the road and let you enjoy it. Try to imagine a Jack Reacher without the wit or compelling storyline.The story line for A Walk Among The Tombstones is obvious, and if you have seen the trailer you've seen most of the movie (including some of the final act movements), and I think that one of the films major set backs is that it's so restricted being based from a book, it feels like all the time the movie wants to kick the whole thing up a gear and make something REALLY compelling, but instead it has to coast along on the track it's been nailed to.I'm sure if A Walk Among The Tombstones had come out at a different year it would be a stronger film, but when it's surrounded by titles Like Cold In July, The Equalizer and The Two Faces OF January, the film can't help but get lost in the shuffle.The cast are near non existent apart from the headliner Liam Neeson, and for once I think this is a mistake, I would have liked to see more from the supporting player, because in truth most of them are stereotypes; we are given the psychotic killers without emotions, the street wise kid who doesn't really know how to take care of himself, and the drug addicted friend who is the go between for the two worlds.A Walk Among The Tombstones is a film that's easy to mock, and simple to pull to bits, but for me it was a nice thriller that ticked all the required boxes.",A Walk Among the Tombstones

Anyway, this movie featured one-trick-badass Neeson as an unconvincing private detective with... you guessed it... general bad ass tendencies.He meets a street kid that he helps show the way that in turn returns the same favour... stupid plot. They didn't need the kid. I was actually happy to see him beaten in it.The bad guys are introduced too early, which strips away the suspense that would have made this so much better.And the stories of how the women are captured and murdered severely lacks what it attempts to portray as brutality.

164,Palidan400,A Decent Walk Among the Tombstones,7,4 October 2014,"Liam Neeson is back in another thriller, making another threatening phone call to the kidnappers. At first glance, it seemed to me to be just another rehash of his other films that would provide some mediocre entertainment. Surprisingly, however, ""A Walk Among The Tombstones"" exceeded my expectations and kept me hooked for a solid two hours. Besides Liam Neeson being awesome as usual, what helped the film succeed is its writing and construction of the film around its writing. From its trailers, it seemed like a generic action flick, but the film actually does not rely heavily on action at all. Instead, it's a good ol' detective story with Scudder as the private eye, and I loved that. The characters and their situations do fall into typical roles (the alcoholic cop struggling for redemption, kidnapping, drugs being involved negatively, the homeless kid being taken in) but the actors all perform well and convincingly enough to make it work. The dialogue is blunt and raw, creating ultimately some wacky but still realistic interactions between people (if not funny in some instances as we watch people in the film approach the Y2K problem).The villains' identities are revealed early on, so it's not really a ""whodunnit"" type of story, but a question of how Scudder will find them. Paired with the natural dialogue and the actors' performances to deliver it, the film keeps you watching intently because there is no clear outcome to each conflict as they come and go. Scudder is not some genius investigator, and the stakes progressively get higher and higher the closer he gets. While the overall picture may be predictable, the individual instances and scenes are dark, sometimes unexpected and all in all satisfying. There is some interesting cinematography and editing to add to the mood. The shots themselves were often long, staring, fitting with the dark and quietness of the film, yet the way they were cut really makes things stand out at times. I wouldn't know how to describe it other than to say that it's odd, but it works well. The sound design and soundtrack is decent; nothing special either but certain parts stand out and really help build the intensity. Still, while many aspects are decently commendable and enticing enough to pull you in, at second look, some parts seem a bit systematic. Like with many assistant-type characters, T.J. is the homeless kid whom you have to just buy into really as Scudder's sidekick. Though not an issue in itself, interestingly there are also really no female characters in the film. All in all, ""A Walk Among The Tombstones"" earns a strong 7.5/10 from me. This rough detective story with Liam Neeson is a refreshing sight to see, aided mostly by its solid writing from director/writer Scott Frank. RATING: [7.5/10]",A Walk Among the Tombstones

The movie makes a lot of side stories from that point on but never follows thru on any of'm leaving you with a lot of loose ends. I red some where the book difference a lot from the script and I think the script writer and the director wasted this story by trying to make it politically correct.The whole 12 steps from A.A.mixed with the climax of the movie was useless and totally out of place and context with the scenes that are being showed.I really felt when non-stop came out it would be Liam's nose dive but compared to this execution that one was brilliant.Better luck next time Mr.Neeson, You still have an excellent track record.

So after whipping up the last minute pudding (quick defrost of the last year's leftover brownies), all I had to do was crank up our trusty old projector, sit down and enjoy the show.However Five minutes into this movie, and I was already experiencing that sinking feeling that comes with spotting the all to familiar trademarks of a s**t movie quickly floating onto the surface. Contempt prior to investigation being the dubious luxury of Other People, I decided to concentrate on the positives, and ignore the rest. First of all, I ignored Liam Neeson's sporadic acting. Granted, the man definitely appears to act in some scenes, but then seems to clear forget who Matt Scudder even is (his character). As another reviewer quite rightly pointed out, our Liam used to be a serious actor which must've been before he attended the Cryogenic School Of Acting (okay: this thought may have sounded funnier when it first popped into my head, mid-point through the movie, cheering me up no end so I had to use it in my Review - note the capital - I owed it that much).I also tried my hardest to ignore Dan Stevens, playing the role of the supposedly freshly bereaved not to mentioned deeply traumatised drug dealer, scrap that: trafficker, Kenny Kristo. I tried to ignore his stenciled-on mustache, casting a pretend shadow over his permanently half-cocked mouth. I tried to ignore his voice, which I'm guessing was meant to sound slightly more devastated than 30 Rock's Jack Donaghy's stint as a voice of the pronouncify.com. What else? The baddies behaved very very badly, chopping random women into bits, without any explanation as to why (oh, I get it, they're bad). Then there's this token black kid, a bit of a clever chap forward slash urban orphan: his name's TJ (or something-J), and he brings precisely nada to the movie. On contrary, it makes the already shabby plot appear even shabbier, not to mention random (and not in a good way). Oh yeah, and there's this birdman guy who looks promising for about 10 seconds, but then suddenly jumps off the rooftop, probably realised he was in the wrong movie.Could go on, but luckily running out of time I have put aside for reviewing dumb movies. To summarise, this movie's not worth the digital imprint it left in its sorry wake.

There are bad criminals and smart people who can catch them, and that's the basic premise of film.Nothing fancy, nothing too deep. Liam Neeson plays every-man cop, Matt Scudder. He has no real superpowers, except being impervious to low morals. Scudder is a loner, who finds a side kick in a street kid named TJ, who is his every-man Robin.Scudder solves one murder, prevents another in a mildly entertaining way. I've spent worse hours in front of a screen.However, fans of the genre, who might be type cast as men over 55. From the flyover state and suburbs.

So my five stars, plus a two star homage to my dad, and all the other dads out there.Matt Scudder is the 86 Caprice Classic of movie stars, but they sold millions of those cars. So I hope Neeson enjoyed this role, and makes more Scudder films. It's honest, poorly acted, and shot, direction was really not an issue either.

170,benoit_03,"Sombre, gritty Neeson thriller, with a little realism thrown in.",8,7 October 2014,"A WALK AMONG THE TOMBSTONESBased on, in fact, the 10th of Lawrence Block's novels starring private investigator Matthew Scudder, A Walk Among the Tombstones revolves around a string of murders, of which the private eye is called in to investigate.The story has a few of the genre clichés, but what you end up with is a gripping crime thriller that shows us a little more of Liam Neeson than the usual action-packed punch- athon. Praise goes to Neeson's portrayal of Scudder, bringing a sense of hard-done-by and believability to the role. A few times, in contrast to his Taken days, he tends to be on the receiving end of the punches and shows his faults like any normal human being as opposed to the unstoppable 'I will find you, and I will kill you' mentality of his Brian Mills counterpart.Those with a short attention span may need to stick with it a little through the middle, as the pace does slow down as we begin to explore Scudder's past and it begins to set up for the last third. The whole feel of the film is very gritty and narrative driven, reminiscent of the way Sin City plays in parts. That said, those who love a bit of story and drama over mindless action will enjoy this a lot.Alongside Neeson, there are a number of other actors that play their roles convincingly. Dan Stevens (of Downton Abbey and The Guest fame) and newcomer Brian Bradley playing private eye-wannabe and Scudder lackey TJ, whose attempts of detective work provide a couple of tongue in cheek laughs.Really, if you enjoy a properly thought out story and have realistic expectations, then this is the picture for you.

There's a superbly staged opening shootout, although a later one in a rain-drenched cemetery doesn't have quite the same impact. A persistent sense of gloom and menace pervades the film, helped by the formidable array of seedy characters that crossing the screen. Performances are uniformly excellent, with Dan Stevens shaking off his ""Downton Abbey"" poshness once again (an even less wholesome character than he played in ""The Guest""). On the downside, I could have done without the streetwise urchin adopted(?) by Liam Neeson, and the final sequence in a blood soaked basement almost descends into the mad-killer-who-can't-be-killed syndrome.

172,oceanic_osprey,A lot walking.....,6,24 September 2014,"Greetings all, I went into this film with much trepidation, very aware of what I'd consider Neeson's poorest action endeavour in Taken 2. So I expected much of the same.This was, however, not the case. For those anticipating another rip-roaring, adrenaline-fuelled rampage you will be disappointed. I found the the action intensity to be much more subdued, which in turn allowed for slightly greater substance and depth.It felt like a mystery driven feature more than anything else, which hurt it in a way, for the viewer at least, since major revelations are made near the half way point, after which time intrigue is lessened considerably. And the director's choice of a violent/chaotic ending takes more away from the piece than it adds.As characters go the supporting cast was mildly believable, with Dan Stevens giving a performance a far cry from his 'Downton Abbey' days. My issue lay heavily on the sidekick scenario, shoehorned in as an opportunity to perceive our protagonist as relatable, but yet again this furthered us from the experience rather than draw us in.In summary, I cannot fault the atmosphere, it was dark and murky from the offset and, as previously mentioned, the first act kept me somewhat interested. But with more shots of Liam Neeson walking than I care to mention, and a plot that runs ever formulaic as the film progresses I found this feature left wanting a great many things.I would hesitantly recommend this for the sole reason of Neeson's departure from non-stop (pun well and truly intended) action to tackle a darker subject matter.",A Walk Among the Tombstones
173,Jacobhemphill96,Very Entertaining,8,18 February 2015,"Looking for stylish action-thriller a bit different from all the clichéd action stereotypes of today? Well look no further. A Walk Among The Tombstones is a very satisfying, entertaining and disturbing movie. Liam Neeson gives a much better performance here than he does in any of the abysmal Taken films. Matthew Scudder is a very interesting character. We are also given much support from Dan Stevens as drug lord, Kenny Kristo and the kid they got to play the character of TJ is actually a good actor. The villains are particularly nasty. The two kidnappers in the film are incredibly violent and sadistic and make the audience feel uncomfortable just watching them. The entire feel of this movie is dark and dismal which is perfect because that's exactly the kind of atmosphere the book. Particular scenes are very violent as well. Overall this is an excellent film and definitely worth your time.",A Walk Among the Tombstones
174,PostingandToasting,The Annual Liam Neeson Action Film: A New Favorite Tradition.,6,20 September 2014,"Ahh yes...the time has come for one of my fairly recent favorite traditions...the annual release of a Liam Neeson movie where he is just being a bad a**. Ever since ""Taken"", the world has been re- introduced to Neeson as it's newest and truest action hero. For the most part during this little resurrection for Neeson, you know that despite any flaws the film might have, it ends up being great entertainment regardless and you overlook those things. The only minor grievance that one might have during this tradition, is that as much as you don't want to admit it, some of these Neeson movies just aren't as good.Now before we go any further we have to discuss the exact trend of the Neeson films. I am only including the movies where Neeson is, for the most part, the only star and he is playing some grizzled, world weary, growling bad a** with a checkered past. This exempts movies like ""The A-Team"", ""Clash/Wrath of the Titans"", and ugh....""Battleship"".....dear lord that was terrible....although it it is always nice to see Rihanna trying to be a bad a**, ""Aloha, mother f***er!"". Anyway, you get the picture. As for the examples of slightly less awesome Neeson bad a** movies, these are the ones like ""Unknown"", and some may even say ""Non-Stop"" but I actually enjoyed that one.""A Walk Among the Tombstones"" falls into that category. Many will go into this movie looking to see Neeson kicking dudes a**es left and right and they may be sorrily disappointed. ""Tombstones"" is more about the detective story and the darkness that the characters descend into as the film progresses. Neeson plays Matt Scudder, a retired cop/alcoholic turned P.I. after a case 8 years ago that left him emotionally and psychologically scarred. He is brought to meet drug dealer (excuse me, ""trafficker"") Kenny Kristo (worse drug kingpin name ever?) who wants to hire him to find the two men who kidnapped and murdered his wife despite paying them the money they asked for. Scudder, along with a spunky, homeless kid T.J, fish around for clues. Their relationship is interesting at first because it's unclear as to why Scudder continues to come into contact with this kid besides the fact that perhaps by helping this kid, he can make up for a lot of sins he has committed in his past.The film can be slow at times, but Neeson is almost in every scene and his presence alone keeps you engaged in every step he takes. As you get closer and closer to the truth the film gets more disturbing. This film is unnerving for sure and is a mental disturbance more than anything. Even though it may not be as action packed as some of Neesons' past films (The Grey still doesn't get enough love) but it may be a pleasant surprise for other reasons. One of Americas guilty pleasures is loving serial killers (Dexter, The Killing, Hannibal, films and series, Se7en, etc.) so people may actually enjoy the film but for a completely different reason then they previously thought. Oh, and don't worry, Liam still has some clever ""bad a** one-liners"" keeping up with the tradition...Can't wait till next year.I joyously await your criticism for my overuse of bad a**.6/10.",A Walk Among the Tombstones
175,Mary444,Liked it for a late-summer afternoon,7,30 September 2014,"Liam Neeson delivers as a brooding, hulking ex-cop on a mission. It's always a treat to see Liam command every scene. There's something about his walk - as the director took great aim in capturing. Walking and brooding against fences, walls, and buildings. A determined walk. This movie is a clever and engaging thriller/mystery with a mesmerizing star. Surprising was the metamorphosis of Dan Stevens into a tormented under-world character. Olafir Olafsson also commands every scene as another tormented soul. Brian ""Astro"" Bradley is compelling as the young teen. What was most intriguing was Eric Nelsen, who evokes disgust at his life choices, yet compassion. He has the face of an angel and yet conveyed torment about his life choices. I liked the movie for a late-summer thriller/murder-mystery stroll into the theaters!",A Walk Among the Tombstones
176,Manveer_Mathur,Engaging Thriller with a Star but Optional,6,20 July 2019,"Liam Neeson's fans this way please! Probably the best thing about the movie is how well Liam Neeson fits the main character which is a retired cop turned private detective with a tormented past. It's always a treat to watch his intense looks and heroics. The rest of the film is your usual crime story line with no major plot changing twists.

178,Haider-kazmee,Very Realistic,9,18 September 2014,"This movie right here was great . I kinda enjoyed even more because the mood/theme was perfect, and everything from the Motion picture score fitted in place. The cinematography had me when they didn't shake the camera not even once. I do have some problems with the clichés, but I forgave them because It's Liam Neeson and he nailed the role of a retired cop/ private detective. There were scenes of great tension throughout and each event built up to that. Even though this story has been done before, It still seems a bit fresh due to the fact that it's New York City and many of the crimes shown are quite believable. Ignore the bad reviews on this site. Only for people who can remember names and enjoy watching detective/noir films. This exceeds in it's category so don't bash it. The scenes are a bit more grittier then the action sequences in Taken, and that's a plus from me since It's entertaining. This movie is an adaptation of a book with the same name by Lawrence Blocks. To summarize the above statement I'd definitely would watch it again. It does take a slow pace in the middle but it's worth it.",A Walk Among the Tombstones

180,peter-sweeney,Shock Horror! Liam Neeson a recovering alcoholic......,6,24 September 2014,"This should have been a real good thriller similar to ""Seven"". But couldn't really decide what it really wanted to be, so became somewhere between a ""Taken"" no nonsense thriller and the more thoughtful stylish ""Manhunter"" type find the serial killer.In the end it just was an overlong ordinary ""find and kill"" the bad guys(whom in this case are really nasty!!) thriller; with the viewer routing for them to be caught and dispatched of...in a suitable violent manner!! Whilst it's attention grabbed at the outset and for quite some time. Disappointment then set in as it did not offer anything to set this apart thus descending into a so-so thriller!! Unnecessary scenes include many with TJ; especially the scene where he had the gun and Neeson was showing him how to use it and then telling him to point it to his head and shoot! Nice moralising Liam! This is a homeless kid on the streets of a rough part of New York - graffiti everywhere!! I would think a gun would be useful.The end reel involving i) ransom exchange ii) a shoot off iii) disposing of the bad guys linked-in to 12 ""moral"" statements from an AA meeting that Neeson used to attend, uttered on the soundtrack during these scenes, failed to make any impact for this viewer.The attempt to convey that Neeson learnt some life changing lessons picked up by attending these meetings seemed to be laid on a bit thick, plus, how is that apparent when he s still shooting guys, causing suicides and creating havoc wherever he goes....!? Trying to add some deep existential layer just did not come off and whatever the Director was trying to convey...seem laboured.",A Walk Among the Tombstones
181,akashimdb,A Walk Among the Tombstones is the resurgence of its kind not to be missed!,9,23 September 2014,"Crime is the most realistic a genre can get. If you like the ongoing obsession called True Detective, just dump this review and run to a theater to watch the Scott Frank's deceitful craft A Walk Among the Tombstones, based upon Lawrence Block's 1992 novel of the same title. Liam Neeson plays illegal private detective Matthew Scudder assigned a reluctant case of a barbarous gay couple who kidnap a drug trafficker Kenny Kristo's beautiful wife. Kenny pays the ransom only to be served with wrapped severed body parts of his wife, deeming the killers nothing less than psychos who turn out to serial.Tombstones is unlike Taken and the stint of films Neeson had after that. He is a solo protagonist but not the predictable character that will end the film with all being well. The best part is that the serial murders have nothing to do with Scudder's personal life. He is never the target. He won't directly care about his unavoidable teen sidekick TJ (Brian 'Astro' Bradley), but he is resourceful when it comes to work sans his gun. The film gives a rush of Taken in a telephone conversation involving Scudder dominating the villain, but that's all. Scudder is a serious persona with a wry humor and his chemistry with TJ is amusing.Writer-director Scott Frank is a reviver for this desperately needed cinema. He derives influences from Martin Scorsese's Goodfellas and Steven Splielberg's Munich for this one. Tombstones hardly wavers from its prime plot. There is no scene singly specifying any personal aspect of any character, not even that of the serial killers. He has kept the film gory in a passive manner instead of visual ranting. Also you never what you might be shown next. The film has brilliant performances from other lesser known actors. The depiction of Brooklyn in 1999 is artistic. The film comes off more as a surprise from Neeson's side. Let's just hope this is a start to a film series!",A Walk Among the Tombstones
182,swf64,Very Well Made,7,30 September 2014,"This movie reminded me of Blade Runner, Brian De Palma, and Scorsese. In fact the only real flaw in the movie is it never finds a center for it's self or it's main character. This is offset by the fact that the great P.I. movies of the past never did either, and this movie is strait out of that vain.Matthew Scudder is loner who follows his own path and never lets you inside. He does what he thinks is right and he knows things aren't black and white.The movie is elegantly shot, fairly slow, and not overly complex. It uses a great actor, and a very well made movie, to take us back to the great P.I. movies of the past. I can see this being a series very easily. 6.9",A Walk Among the Tombstones
183,deelusionalmusic,"You'll love it, Spoiler Alert",10,22 October 2014,"First off, let me say that if you enjoyed the movie 8MM with Nicholas Cage, then you'll love this film. The plot is fairly similar and the acting, cast, and settings are very pleasing to view. Now, let's give some insight to the film. ""TJ (The Astronomical Kid)"" who plays a major role in the movie was made famous off of the TV show X Factor after reciting a song he wrote for his mother. Now, as an up and coming actor/song writer and performer, he is making a big name for himself in Hollywood. This film revolves around serial killers, crooked cops, homeless kids, alcoholism, drug dealers, and snuff and other fetish fantasies (which are literally made a reality while walking among tombstones of rape/murder victims). The content of the rape/murder scenes are not extremely graphic in visible nature, but more suggestive to what is to come next. So anyone with a weak heart for those sorts of things, still have a running chance at viewing this title without becoming overwhelmed. Liam Neeson (once again, playing the role of the hero investigator) leads the cast with a crooked cop, with a past history of violent, careless alcoholic tendencies. After being hired to investigate, and ultimately find and handover the crazed serial killers who kidnapped and murdered the wife of a local drug dealer, ""Neeson"" being hesitant at first, ends up starting his journey into the dark, eerie world of snuff. After a few minor leads, ""Neeson"" heads to the library to do some research. (This is where he meets ""TJ"" (the homeless kid with a dream of becoming a legendary detective))After discovering some helpful information with the help of his new sidekick ""TJ"", ""Neeson"", goes on to further investigate characterized people, and places which play a more sinister role in the plot of the movie. Now to make a long story short, from this point in time, ""Neeeson"" is able to put the pieces together scene by scene. He answers the phone calls made by the killers, while placing their ransom. He discerns the killers by setting his own set of rules instead of giving into the demands of the killers. He discovers the killers are homosexuals with a passion for kidnapping, torturing, raping, videotaping, and dismembering women who are in a relationship with drug dealers. He sets up a meet with the killers. He wounds one of the killers. They get away. ""TJ"" hides in the killers van and arrives at the killers home. ""TJ"" calls ""Neeson"". ""Neeson"" arrives to save the day with the original hiring victim who's wife was killed. ""Neeson"" captures the killers and leaves so that the original victim can do his dirty work. The killers get loose. They kill the original victim. ""Neeson"" comes back to finish ""saving the day"". He kills the killers (Sic). ""TJ"" and ""Neeson"" start their own detective agency, and the movie comes to a close. I've rated this film 10 stars. I highly suggest that you watch this flick. Grab some beer, and a steak. Get a bitch who's willing to put out on date night and enjoy the show.",A Walk Among the Tombstones
184,teddyackerdude,Could have been really dark and gritty,6,1 February 2015,"This movie started out as the run of the mill Neeson action movie. Grissly bad a** with a checkered pass just wants to do good. At first I thought this was just going to be that same old formula and then it took a dark turn which reminded me a hell of a lot of 8mm. The only difference is that where 8mm rode the dark train and wasn't afraid to scare and disgust the hell out of you A Walk Amongst the Tombstones just didn't have the same attitude. The more I think about it the more I struggle to comprehend how they failed to deliver on this movie. You have Eastern European gangsters, you have an ex-cop trying to redeem himself, there are two psychos cutting woman's breasts off with wire and leaving body parts all over town and you even have the token under privileged kid that needs saving. But they didn't push it far enough. It is like somebody wanted to make the movie the way it should have been made, dark, gritty, kinda like you want to look away but you can't, but they weren't allowed to. It feels like they said you can make a bad a** movie but you can't darken the image of Neeson.

185,Motopsycho2,Same as a single episode of a mediocre TV show,5,20 September 2014,"We all love Liam Neeson as the badass action hero who kills bad guys in every scene. He cannot be stopped and will eventually overcome his enemies who are usually underestimating him massively. Ever since Taken, Liam has been typecast as this character in numerous movies such as Taken 2, Non-Stop, Unknown, etc. Well, he plays the exact same role in this one all over again. Now, there is nothing wrong with that if the writers had introduced something unique, something that differentiates this movie from previous Liam Neeson action movies. Not only they have failed entirely to differentiate themselves from a single episode of an everyday detective TV show but the pace of the movie is much slower than of a TV show and the character development is meaningless and entirely cliché.The production team has simply put all their money betting on Neeson's reputation and success as an action hero. They are betraying viewer's trust by promising them something they know they are not capable of delivering. All the clichés of a Liam Neeson action flick exist in this movie and by watching a single episode of The Wire, CSI, Dexter, etc., you are already ahead in terms of the ticket price and your precious time.",A Walk Among the Tombstones
186,Eightiesseeker,Liam Neeson does what he does best,7,15 January 2015,"Is a nice and entertaining crime thriller. Is dark, has suspense and action, even some compassion. Liam Neeson does a nice acting, so did others.What I didn't quite understand, besides the fact the novel says so, that it mainly takes place in 1999 (or 1991 in a flashback). The Y2K bug was not really exploited, although mentioned. I couldn't see any reasons of why it didn't take place in the year of the release (2014). Thus among other things the crew had to take care that cars were not newer than from 1999 (there is a goof where a modern (model year after 2010) white Mazda or Hyundai can be seen parked under a bridge). They had to put some old traffic lights for pedestrians in place (WALK - DON'T WALK), and other things.",A Walk Among the Tombstones

The plot is not something of an innovation. the story happens in the late 90's and you gotta like the Y2K hints. The bond that starts to build up between Liam Neeson and the boy is very much believable. The alcoholics anonymous sessions are nice. Liam's drunken character is believable. The plot is intriguing although a little bit predictable. Nonetheless, I recommend to see this movie to appreciate how serial killer movies are treated differently nowadays in comparison with the 90s. And yes, Liam Neeson still got it. There is no way this movie could have been rated above 7 hadn't been to this excellent actor.",A Walk Among the Tombstones

189,Lynxspirit,"Shades of ""Taken""",7,28 April 2020,"What is it with Liam Neeson and kidnap dramas? Although I have to say this is more substance, less blatant action for its own sake, and his character is more relatable, flawed and real. And more noble since his motives are altruistic rather than on a personal case of vengeance and he is a haunted character seeking redemption. This makes it a cut above the Taken series and by far more interesting. There is a running spiritual element to this, mentioned in the 12 Steps and in the names of the victims which are all allusions of God, man and Christ. This helps take it beyond what would otherwise be an excuse to brutalize women. It is noticeably lacking a strong female presence, which I understand was cut (mistakenly IMHO) from the final by eliminating a major character. Dan Stevens' complicated character of a mourning drug-dealer and Brian ""Astro"" Bradley as the precocious TJ serve to add depth and dimension to this film.",A Walk Among the Tombstones
190,DebtotheC,Liam N. gets deeper & darker w/every film he makes...,6,28 June 2015,"Definitely not for the faint of heart. Liam Neeson is a great actor, in my humble opinion. However, it seems sad to me that the tone and/or tenor of his choices in his acting roles ever since the untimely & tragic death of his lovely and also very talented wife, Natasha Richardson (daughter of the incomparable! Vanessa Redgrave) have grown to be so overwhelmingly dark in comparison to the many different types of roles he used to take on with such gusto prior to her death. They all tend to be ""good guys"" in the strictest sense of the words, and I find myself wondering what truly compels him to take on these type of roles over and over again. I truly hope that it is not remorse over feelings of any type of culpability, or remorse at not having been present when her accident occurred, etc. Remorse and sadness are to be expected at the passing of a spouse; particularly one who seemed to be as beloved by everyone in her orbit as she appeared to be--husband, children, parents, siblings, fellow actors, and friends, etc. I just really hope that he is well on his way to having whatever type of demons that seem to possess him are now on their way to being exorcised because I really miss the variety of the roles he used to play and I truly do care about his well-being. On to this part and this film---I liked this film better than a number of the films he has done in recently, particularly the 2nd and 3rd in the ""Taken"" franchise. I could have done without those entirely and they really seemed to be redundant to me. I make a real effort to see every single film he is in because of how much I respect his acting and also everything I know of him and how he has conducted his life and behavior as a person and particularly as a parent ever since his wife's death. This film is very violent and as I stated before definitely ""not for the faint of heart"", but it also holds the quality of the ""good guys"" for the most part, coming out on top. There were a couple parts that I have to admit were a tad formulaic and he (the former cop) should have seen coming as well, like the suicide by jumping off a roof by a purported suspect (in his opinion at the time of the jump), at least it was obvious to me. I liked the inclusion of the young man who assisted him almost from the get-go; young T.J. It was really very fresh to include T.J. and his own physical health problems and added additional flavor to the film. I have a history myself of having been attacked at 16 and almost dying as a result, and I have since the age of about 30, always found (strange as it may seem) watching movies of this type almost therapeutic for me and my long history of PTSD because it has made me more aware that things of this type happen everywhere and that no-one is immune. I can repeat to myself over and over ""It's only a movie"" and work my way through my own personal fears of the dark and scary things that can happen in this world we all inhabit.

Once the movie started it clearly went another direction, and gave off more of a vibe, like that of the movie ""Ransom"" starring Mel Gibson.Liam Neesons performance was very solid as it often is, not nearly as much action as his roles usually produce, but much stronger and brought to light dialogue. The supporting roles did a nice job of tying everything together, led by David Harbours creepy portrayal as Ray, one of the Kidnappers.All in all I was pleasantly surprised at how the whole film turned out, but it is not for the faint of heart as there are some pretty creepy scenes, but it definitely delivers!

193,Bimpen,Standard serial (killer). with intervention,4,9 January 2015,"The plot is very standard: hard core cop who left his job because he did ""the right thing"" according to ""public opinion"", which is as usual NOT done according to present legislation. He would have gotten away with it, but was unlucky and caused collateral damage, which is in the US regarded as not OK, but very OK if it happens in for instance Irak. Hard core cop has to live as a poor but good PI, for hire only if the moral is OK, money is no object.The cop gets in a moral dilemma: help drug dealers AND simultaneously help their innocent relatives? Liam Neeson does a god job, the standardized character isn't overdone or overplayed and this would easily be given a ""6"", if not for some of the stupid screenplay writing. (possibly the novelist, I really don't know).For some reason, in the US you can only help alcoholics if you involve God? Nobody struck by alcoholism can be in self control without God? For this reason, there is an AA-voice-over talking religious stuff (a wild guess is it about the Christian God) in the beginning of the finale. Intervention by a divine being??? This completely undermines the main character and his actions.Try to endure the ""God-stuff"" and this could be a reasonable entertainer for a Friday night, if your standards aren't too high.

Hardly any film he's in is disappointing but I'm afraid to say that this is one of them.The beginning was fantastic - a great action scene that starts in a bar and gives us an insight into the past of Neeson's character. We meet Dan Stevens' character pretty soon after and everything is moving at a perfect pace. The initial storyline seems intriguing. However, the pace soon slows right down and the film (almost 2 hours) is filled with lots of scenes that don't really add anything to the plot and have no entertainment value.For action fans the film will disappoint as the only action scenes are at the very beginning and the very end. For suspense/thriller fans the film will disappoint as it is badly written and the killers are introduced to the audience far too early on to have much effect.The only good things about the film are Liam Neeson, Dan Stevens and the first scene of the film.",A Walk Among the Tombstones

The book's ending is much better. And what happened to the computer whiz kids that put him on the track via phone lines? They were good character roles. And what happened to Matt's girlfriend? I think they got about 50% of the book and the rest was BS. Kenny was really boring and his brother Peter was made out to look like a druggie for the entire movie - in the book he was recovering, until the end when he broke down.

I don't mind slow investigating movie, but in this one there was noting to investigate about. We hear about some wife killers, and instead of Liam Neeson a kid does more investigation then our lead actor, using a computer, but that's fine cause it's late 90's and our hero doesn't like technology. Ignoring everything I kept on watching and I have to admit, the build of the villains was good, but they were so stupid to let their part time member/driver go while they were committing a murder, and that guy has so much evidence which he keeps on roof top where Liam just has to go, well I'm sure that's the place every cop goes to looking for evidence, not your room, not your drawer but the roof of the building where you life! Anyhow, after that the kidnapper start taking orders from a person who knows so much about their crime, instead of just killing the one they kidnapped and getting out of the mess. Well maybe they are desperate about the money, but the thing is we get to know about their two murders, and there is one that they plan on doing where Liam takes the control. We did see they took money from the first murder, but the fiancé's murder, why did that happen, there was no money involved there, why are these Ex-DEA agents after these drug dealers families, how many have they actually killed, apart from the villain's names, we know nothing about that side of story. There was no suspense at all, I mean there was some at the beginning and it was good till then, later we find out the villains and there was no twist or turn after that. Well I still give it 4/10 because of the tension it created in the first half, beautiful sound effects, better acting than usual from Liam Neeson, and the fact that it had the perfect amount of humor in it's dark plot, it could have been so much better.

Very much of a waste of time. The premise is absolutely ridiculous so far fetched it's like we have no minds. Thanks but no thanks. Please Liam no more, just put some effort into a real movie that forces you to actually act.",A Walk Among the Tombstones
202,saadforever890,Liam Neeson is Awesome!!!!,8,19 September 2014,"Liam Neeson is awesome & yes he has nailed it again in this well crafted thriller!! Even though the initial plot is kinda of a cliché, but the intense & gritty setting of NYC manages to keep you hooked on for its nearly 120 minutes run time. People who are looking for a ""Taken"" type of film will be quite disappointed, as this more of ""The Grey"" kind of film, in other words, less action more crime drama. There's a slight humor added well to the on going proceedings by Brian ""Astro"" Bradley which is sure to be lapped up by everyone. I wasn't particularly happy with David Harbour & Adam Thompson's portrayals as the killers, but the grisly glimpses into the killers' barbaric methods in bits and pieces are sure to churn your stomach. The real winner of this film is the brilliantly crafted screenplay & gritty direction of Scott Frank. Overall A Walk Among the Tombstones﻿ is a grim, mournful, and often graphically violent detective drama, which may not appeal to everyone, but being a fan of the detective noir genre, oh please give more!!",A Walk Among the Tombstones

Every actor is given a pass to cash in on their name for a quick buck (and i'm pretty sure this film didn't take too long to shoot), but please don't do it again in a hurry!

Come on really? and look at this from the equalizer: A man believes he has put his mysterious past behind him and has dedicated himself to beginning a new life... from a walk among the tombstones: is almost the same thing he was a former cop and now a private eye... he left his past life also omg... please I was so mad and i think im still hahaha stupid movies!!!,A Walk Among the Tombstones
209,k-eijeriks,"Classical, beautiful, illogical",8,6 December 2014,"As a fan of ""detective-with-a-broken-heart"" movies, I gave this title a high rating. There is no shame in that: it contains beautiful pictures, they've managed to present a silence and one's inwardness in the middle of the city and most of the actors are well-fit for their roles (as well appearance as acting skills), the story consists of all the classical parts (drunk cop kills the innocent/hangover cop has remorse/retired cop wants to make up for the evil done etc., reveals the dove's heart in a macho chest). I took away two points though - because of the monstrous logic holes in the storyline and the hideous stereotypes that made my heart and brain bleed. Just to provide few examples... GAPS: if entering unasked the residence of a drug dealer - ain't you supposed to meet some rottweilers, security guards-mugs or at least a door lock with an alarm? And why did the two psychos actually do it? Who were they? Being a mature and concerned detective, would u give a rifle to a junkie trusting in his aiming skills? STEREOTYPES: are u sure that every Russian mobster wears a sport-suit and white socks with rubber slippers? Do bad guys are always like Pinkie & Brain (full contradictions)?

Working now as a private investigator, Scudder accepts his latest case that gets him involved with some bad people, and some really bad people. From there, you tag along with him as he tries to identify the people who are responsible for the murder of his employer's wife.This might sound like something you have seen before because it is and it isn't. While the movie feels like previous pictures, it still manages to do the same things differently.The film manages to keep you attached with well acted characters, a steady story, that sometimes derails in different directions but quickly collects itself and progresses with the central story, and some really deranged villains that sometimes make you question humanity or the lack of, in this case.To end this review, the film is entertaining with some slow moments here and there, though they are usually integral to the characters or the story itself.Rating: Medium WellMister Movie",A Walk Among the Tombstones

It doesn't make sense as to why he accepted the job with the drug kingpin in the first place. Then you have absolutely no idea why the bad guys are killing people. What's their motive? What is their criteria for picking victims? Did they themselves or one of their loved ones suffer great trauma from random violence? Were they informants?

219,langangeoff,avoid like the plague,1,4 October 2014,I'm a big Liam Neeson fan like many people who would be looking to check this film out but do yourselves a favor and totally avoid this. I can't remember the last time I was so bored in the cinema to the point that I actually left during its finale. Literally nothing even remotely interesting happens in this film and anything that does you've seen a million times before. It's so clichéd and ridiculous at the same time. Quick summary of the story is that family members of drug dealers are being kidnapped and murdered and our hero Neeson is the man they turn to for assistance. That's it. Unfortunately his journey to find justice is so drawn out and uneventful that by the time the finale comes you could care less what happens in the end. I left with approx 15 minutes left as I couldn't handle what I was watching anymore. Neeson kid friend ending up in the van of the kidnappers was the final straw as it was so clichéd. Neeson fans should wait for taken 3 as that looks promising. Avoid this boring film for now.,A Walk Among the Tombstones

But its tone is much darker and it focuses too much on two perverts who do unthinkable things. The movie spent too much time communicating evils done to the victims. No one who has ever been in physical danger -- let alone that type of danger - - is interested in reliving it. And I doubt many such persons would want others to experience such horrors vicariously as this director seemed to want the audience to suffer. I give this movie 3 stars, because the movie was well done for what it is. But if you feel anything, you will feel horrible afterward. If you are what you eat, then I don't want to spend time digesting this kind of darkness.

He used his gun with out thinking once and it was a disaster. The aspects of this movie that felt unique were Neeson's nonchalant no fear of death approach. He really doesn't have a reason to live. Or a reason to accept this case. His only reason to finish is to see that it ends. A real detective in his soul. He needs to know the why, what, where, and when. But the why he doesn't really give a thought to. And why bother? Who cares why these heinous things happen, so long as they can be made to never happen again. I recommend this movie to real fans of detective stories. This isn't a cop movie. This isn't a revenge story. This isn't a redemption story.

228,LTRees,"A great action thriller, however lacks any real mystery.",8,16 October 2014,"It's understandable many people may come to think Liam Neeson has had himself typecast as the action hero, restricted to constant repetitive films. But 'A Walk Among Tombstones' takes the best of Neeson's acting abilities and badassery and puts it into a thriller which pays off to great enjoyment, if a little disappointment in between.The film starts off great, delving into both the action and the character of Matt Scudder (Neeson). The premise of the film follows Neeson's character across a private investigation in which he tries to identify two men responsible for the kidnapping and gruesome murders of several women. The film entertains the idea that it will be a mystery thriller, allowing the audience to detect whether a person of interest is telling the truth or not, all the while trying to figure out the motivation/identity between the horrific killers. The film, unfortunately, seems to play on this for a short time before cutting it off suddenly - giving the film's antagonists their own personal screen time and personal look-in which forces the mystery element to fall flat. Not that this is an entirely bad thing. It gives you a good perspective of who these people are and their methods of 'picking out' their victims, however it does kill the mystery behind it; leaving the remainder of the film a build up to the end rather than a reveal.Something pleasant about the film, which lacks in numerous screenplays today, is character development. It would be a discredit not to mention this as each supporting character throughout the film earns their own backstory; wonderfully setting up their character and/or future events. With a great cast, it wouldn't be surprising to know these characters aren't given their justice. Of course - Liam Neeson being the star role - you'd expect some classic 'Neeson action' but his character is made rich by depth apposed to action, which is a nice contrast to some of his previous films. That's not to say Liam Neeson isn't ""Not killing people in this scene."" Up-and-comer Dan Stevens utilises his acting abilities throughout the film too, potentially making him one of today's most underrated actors.The cinematography is a compliment to the atmosphere of the film. The dark and grittiness of it gives the film a sort of edge which never grows tiring. Scott Frank works magic behind the lens after delivering some great dynamic shots. It is often predictable when a character sneaks up on another, but Frank does well in giving it the sudden reveal by use of the camera.While not being a masterpiece, 'A Walk Among Tombstones' is still an enjoyable flick, delivering some steady characterisation and brilliant direction. If Liam Neeson's name above the title makes you feel like you've already seen the film numerous times before, then you couldn't be more wrong. It's not the biggest change in content, but it's definitely not a Neeson-repeat.",A Walk Among the Tombstones

238,narayansuma,Elegantly crafted,8,2 July 2018,"Movie Review: A Walk Among the TombstonesA Walk Among the Tombstones is a film released on September 19, 2014, written and directed by Scott Frank, based on the 1992 novel of the same name by Lawrence Block. It stars Liam Neeson, Dan Stevens, David Harbour, Brian Bradley, and Boyd Holbrook. 
The movie takes off with the protagonist, Detective Matthew ""Matt"" Scudder in a car, with a partner, who expresses his dissatisfaction with Matthew as a reliable back-up. Later, the detective goes into a bar; while he is there, there, two armed men come in and kill the bartender. Pursuing them, the detective kills all three people, including their getaway driver. Why, as a result of this shootout, Matthew retires from active service is what we come to know later in the movie. Much, much later.
Matthew becomes an active member of an Alcoholics Anonymous group.
Eight years later, a drug addict approaches Matthew and asks him to help his brother, a drug trafiicker whose wife has been kidnapped. Though the husband had rustled up and delivered the ransom money, it was the wife's tortured, brutalised, dis membered body which had been delivered to the husband. Trying to discover a lead or clue, Matthew frequents the library to discover similar crimes. He befriends a savvy, brutally frank, homeless teenager, TJ, in the library. Matthew speaks to people and comes across a groundsman in the graveyard, among the tombstones, close to where another dismembered body, packed in separate plastic bags was found floating in the pond. 
Alone and without help, Matthew shoulders on, digging, digging, digging. And the killers are at large, hunting for their next prey. The scene cuts to the house of the killers from time to time, panning to their terrifying instruments of torture, with sharp, barbaric knives and gouges to cut up bits of living flesh while the victim screamed in agony. Another 14-year old girl is kidnapped; she is the daughter of another trafficker, and suddenly, Mattthew is in the centre of the action...
No, I am not going to be a spoiler here, or reveal the twists and turns of the plot. There are so many unexpected events happening that it is difficult to predict what will happen next.
Watch the movie for Liam Neeson's understated histrionics: how he makes do with one raised eyebrow to convey an entire page of script. He is shown to be human and vulnerable, morose and non-committal: TJ, the homeless teenager is a wonderful foil to his character. Bright, cynical, worldly wise, the would-be detective sails through the movie, putting down his angst and his talent down on pieces of paper, in the form of animation figures.
The climax, where there is a faceoff between the suave, slick killers and the bumbling team consisting of the father of the kidnapped girl, the husband of the murdered woman, the drug addict and Liam Neeson, among the tombstones in the same graveyard, is masterly. The voice over is of a woman reciting the 12 steps of recovery of a confirmed alcoholic: 
1. We admitted we were powerless over alcohol - that our lives had become unmanageable.
2. Came to believe that a Power greater than ourselves could restore us to sanity.
3. Made a decision to turn our will and our lives over to the care of God as we understood Him.
4. Made a searching and fearless moral inventory of ourselves.
5. Admitted to God, to ourselves and to another human being the exact nature of our wrongs.
6. Were entirely ready to have God remove all these defects of character.
7. Humbly asked Him to remove our shortcomings.
8. Made a list of all persons we had harmed, and became willing to make amends to them all.
9. Made direct amends to such people wherever possible, except when to do so would injure them or others.
10. Continued to take personal inventory and when we were wrong promptly admitted it.
11. Sought through prayer and meditation to improve our conscious contact with God as we understood Him, praying only for knowledge of His will for us and the power to carry that out.
12. Having had a spiritual awakening as the result of these steps, we tried to carry this message to alcoholics and to practice these principles in all our affairs.
As these steps are recited in the voice-over, there is a parallel piece of action happening: and I found this analogy particularly moving. The haunting tracks of 'Black Hole Sun' featuring Nouela, that accompanies the rolling credits at the end, sounded like an extension of the neo noir genre that the movie is slotted into.
The movie concludes with a resolution, a firm friendship and trust between two strangers: TJ and Matthew, and a vindication of the resilience of the human spirit despite all odds.
