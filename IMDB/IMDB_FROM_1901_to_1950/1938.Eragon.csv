0,TheLittleSongbird,"Visually and technically assured, with an impressively rendered dragon, but the film could have been better",5,4 April 2010,"First things first, I have yet to read the book, but my brother absolutely loves it and says it is so worth the read. While the film could have been much better, there are redeeming qualities. Also, I do not think it is the worst fantasy film ever, that dishonour belongs to Dungeons & Dragons.Starting with the redeeming qualities, the film is very assured visually and technically. The sets are wondrous and the costumes are very nice. Plus the cinematography was excellent, as was the sweeping score. The acting is uneven, but there were some good performances. Jeremy Irons, a great actor, does a good job as Brom acquiring a dry sense of humour, much better than he was in Dungeons & Dragons, somehow his overacting in that film managed to further bring it down. Also John Malkovich chews the scenery with glee as the tyrannical King Galbatorix, and Robert Carlyle is decent as Durza. The best thing though was the dragon Sapphira, very well designed with expressive voice work from Rachel Weisz, and the flying scenes and the CGI effects are a delight.However, there are many things wrong with Eragon. One is that the film is too short, consequently the characters feel thinly sketched. This could be a reason why the relationship between Eragon and Sapphira came across as unconvincing. The story was a great idea, but due to the running time primarily it meanders all over the place and is unevenly paced(sometimes feeling rushed and sometimes it drags). Ed Speleers is rather bland as Eragon, handsome yes but bland. It is pretty much the same for Sienna Guillory, gorgeous but unconvincing. The actors though are burdened by a very hammy and lacklustre script that could've done with more intelligence and wit and there are parts where the direction is flawed.Overall, not unbearably awful but I don't necessarily recommend it. 5/10 Bethany Cox",Eragon
1,bkoganbing,The Union of Dragon And Rider,9,20 December 2006,"After just coming from a screening of Eragon, I was interested that George Lucas produced this film. That seemed only fitting because young Christopher Pasolini totally ripped this story off from Star Wars and gave it a medieval never never land setting.That being said, I did enjoy this fantasy very much, thought the special effects were great and the players in the cast most appealing. Young Eragon played by Ed Speelers finds a bright blue oval shaped object and keeps it. It turns out to be a dragon's egg and he keeps it and nurses it. When it hatches it's a bouncing baby dragon and a she dragon at that. The dragon's voice is done by Rachel Weisz and while I have to say it doesn't take the place of Sean Connery's voice in Dragonheart, still it's a nice performance.I shouldn't go any farther because if you know the plot of the first Star Wars film you know exactly what happens. Ed Speelers is the Luke Skywalker of the film and he's making a screen debut and a most auspicious one. I understand he was almost cast as Peter Pevensie in The Chronicles of Narnia, the Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe. I could have seen him in that part as well.Acting honors go to Jeremy Irons as the Obi Wan Kenobe of Dragon Riders who breaks in Eragon and teaches him the skills of the dragon riding trade.It's a given like Star Wars there will most definitely be a sequel as too many plot threads were left loose and several characters left hanging so to speak.It's a nice holiday film for the family and I'm glad George Lucas produced it. It certainly is cheaper than a plagiarism suit.",Eragon
2,Leofwine_draca,Dragons & Doldrums,3,5 February 2011,"Based on a popular novel by teenage geek Christopher Paolini, ERAGON turns out to be nothing more than a Tolkien rip-off, featuring many scenes that have been copied from those movies. Those responsible for set design and art direction should be ashamed of themselves. In addition, this is an inferior product in every way, a bland, routine outing that never offers a surprise or twist different from those we've seen before countless times.The story follows the usual ""boy and his pet dragon"" template, mildly enlivened by some good CGI work used to animate the dragon (a shame it's saddled with Rachel Weisz's voice). Ed Speleers, a newcomer to film, is completely wooden as the teenage hero, sapping energy every time he appears on screen. John Malkovich hams it up to an embarrassing degree in his scenes as the villain, Robert Carlyle shows up to get his paycheque, Sienna Guillory is pretty but underused, and character actors like Gary Lewis, Alun Armstrong, Garrett Hedlund and Djimon Hounsou barely register. The only exception is Jeremy Irons, giving a compelling turn as the wise mentor - far better than his appearance in THE TIME MACHINE remake.Weak direction, slow plotting and senseless action sequences only compound the misery, leaving this – as is the case with so many – an utterly forgettable outing with only a few worthless SFX to stop it being a total dog.",Eragon
3,SnoopyStyle,Horribly bland lead,4,28 October 2013,"Eragon (Ed Speleers) is a simple farm boy who finds a dragon egg. When it hatch, he become a dragon rider. He is mentored by former dragon rider Brom (Jeremy Irons). He with his dragon Saphira (Rachel Weisz) must battle the tyrant Galbatorix (John Malkovich) and the dragon riding magician Durza (Robert Carlyle).The biggest problem is the lead Ed Speleers. He lacks any charisma to drive this movie. His style of acting can only be described as deer-in-headlights. His bland face actually becomes annoying. Jeremy Irons is wasted in this flat mess. He has no one to reciprocate with. He has better luck with the dragon.The other problem is utter lack of originality in the story. After spending much of intro explaining the world, it's still a uncompelling mess. I didn't care about this world. And I didn't care about the people in it.The CG and the visual are all up to date. The big battles and dragons look relatively good. The cast with the exception of Speleers are all top notch. The sad part is all of them are wasted.",Eragon
4,Prismark10,Flying the dragon,4,26 June 2014,"Eragon certainly goes for family friendly fantasy that everyone can enjoy but its let down by a pedestrian plot, insipid acting and an uninspired screenplay.The film goes for the Lords of the Ring mixed with Harry Potter films market but is not dazzled by the same magic.The film is about a farm boy who finds an egg that hatched into a dragon and becomes a dragon-rider and enters an adventure freeing the land from a tyrant who once betrayed the dragon riders. What should be a rip roaring adventure never really flies with a story predictable as Jeremy Irons character who is their for purely plot exposition.The special effects are good and you will find the dragon endearing.",Eragon
5,claudio_carvalho,A Delightful Adventure In a World of Dragons and Magic,9,5 May 2007,"The Kingdom of Alagaesia is ruled by the evil King Galbatorix (John Malkovich), a former dragon rider that betrayed his mates and his people in his quest for power. When the orphan farm boy Eragon (Ed Speleers) finds a blue stone sent by Princess Arya (Sienna Guillory), he sooner realizes that it is a dragon egg. When the dragon Saphira is born, Eragon meets his mentor Brom (Jeremy Irons), and becomes the dragon rider foreseen in an ancient prophecy that would set his people free from the tyrant Galbatorix. Eragon meets the rebels Varden and together they fight against the evil sorcerer Durza (Robert Carlyle) and the army of Galbatorix in a journey for freedom.""Eragon"" is a delightful adventure in a world of dragons and magic. I have never read the book, but adaptations of novels to the cinema are not easy, since the languages and the dynamics are different. Further and the most important, when we read a book we use our imagination to create the scenes and the landscapes, while in a movie we see what the director is able to show. I do not agree with the unfair and underrated IMDb User Rating since this movie is excellent: the cinematography, landscapes and special effects are awesome, disclosed in a perfect pace; there are magnificent lines; the cast is amazing, with names like Jeremy Irons, John Malkovich and Robert Carlyle acting with the unknown Ed Speelers and the gorgeous Sienna Guillory. My vote is nine.Title (Brazil): ""Eragon""",Eragon
6,jboothmillard,Eragon,2,10 April 2010,"When I saw the trailer for this film at the cinema, I thought it looked like a rubbish rip-off of The Lord of the Rings, and while the analogy wasn't true, the quality of the film was. Basically Alagaesia is the kingdom ruled by the villain and former dragon rider who betrayed those close to him in his quest for power, King Galbatorix (A very underused John Malkovich). Orphan farm boy Eragon (Ed Speleers) is sent a blue stone by Princess Arya (Sienna Guillory), which he realises is a dragon egg, and out hatches Saphira (Rachel Weisz). She grows into a high flying friend that feels what Eragon feels, which comes in handy for directions and stuff, and soon Eragon meets another former dragon rider and mentor in Brom (Jeremy Irons). They realise that Alagaesia is in trouble, so he joins forces with the good guys in their gang, the race of warriors known as the Varden. They all go into the battle against Galbatorix, evil sorcerer Durza (Robert Carlyle) and the army of weird looking men in the quest for freedom. Also starring Blood Diamond's Djimon Hounsou as Ajihad, Garrett Hedlund as Murtagh, Joss Stone as Angela, Alun Armstrong as Uncle Garrow and Christopher Egan as Roran. The special effects don't add anything, the performances (apart from maybe Irons) are all lame and ineffective, that includes the dragon too, and the action is not interesting enough viewing, an easily forgettable fantasy adventure. Pretty poor!",Eragon
7,ma-cortes,Spellbound Dragon movie with sensational battles and spectacular scenarios,6,16 March 2007,"The movie talks about a young peasant named Eragon (Edward Speleers) living at homeland called Alagaesia , he's an orphan fostered by his uncle (Alun Armstrong) and he finds a mysterious stone like an egg , when suddenly awakening a baby dragon and is named Saphira (voiced by Rachel Weistz) .

They team up and band together and free themselves to the beautiful princess (Sienna Gullory) confronting weird monsters and taking on king's tyranny (John Malkovich) .This amazing story attempts at creating a real fantasy but is compromised by borrowing elements from ¨Dragonheart¨, ¨Dragon Slayer¨ and ¨Lord of the Rings¨ and other latter-day movies . Film blends witchcraft and wizardry , adventures , battles and is extremely fun and amusing . Stimulating action set pieces illuminate the full-blown adventures of Eragon and his Dragon . Casting is frankly well , giving enjoyable performances . Convincing special effects by Industrial Light Magic (George Lucas's owner) bring dragon to life with spectacular images . Work on Dragon took more a year and does seem authentic . Patrick Doyle's soaring musical score is wonderful and colorful cinematography by Hugh Johnson . Picture is beautifully made with phenomenal production values and rousing production design in charge of Wolf Kroeger. The motion picture was marvellously directed by Stephen Fangmeier . As of 2015, this remains the first and only film directed by Stefen , who's mostly known for doing visual effects work on Terminator 2 (1991) and Jurassic Park (1993), and as the second unit director on Galaxy Quest (1999) . It's a unqualified success accounting for one of the greatest dragons in picture story .",Eragon
8,poolandrews,Boring & shallow fantasy adventure.,3,6 July 2010,"Eragon is set in the land of Alagesia where the evil Galbotorix (John Malkovich) has killed all of the Dragon protectors & their riders, Galbotorix has then declared himself King of Alagesia. One night Princess Arya (Sienna Guillory) steals the last remaining Dragon egg from Galbotorix's castle & manages to magically transport to another part of the Kingdom before she is captured. A young farm boy named Eragon (Ed Speleers) finds the egg & once it hatches is shocked to discover that he is now that Dragon's rider, meanwhile Galbotorix's evil sorcerer Durza the Shade (Robert Carlyle) sends the Goblin like Razac creatures to find & kill Eragon before he & his Dragon can reach & inspire the Varden rebels who oppose Galbotorix & will fight against him to wage war on Galbotorix & his evil army of Razac's...This American, British & Hungarian co-production was directed by Stefan Fangmeier & was based on the novel by Christopher Paolini & was an obvious attempt to ride on the success of another huge fantasy film based on literature The Lord of the Rings & to be blunt Eragon feels just like a bland The Lord of the Rings copy. I have never read Paolini's novel but apparently this film guts it by removing dozens of subplots, characters & events. The whole film feels like a second rate rip-off of fantasy novel themes, from a lush land populated by simple folk who are terrorised by a dark lord or king, Elves, Goblin like monsters, big epic battles with swords & bow & arrows, typical fire breathing Dragon's that fly, character's have silly names that you can't remember, there's a Princess in danger & of course a simple hero who has to undergo both a literal & personal journey as he has to master great power & learn to listen to people who tell him to be wise. Eragon is so generic & bland & forgettable that it felt like the makers just sat down & said how can we make another The Lord of the Rings & make lots of money? The makers try to copy just about everything, from the vast shots of the character's travelling across the landscape on horseback to the way the monsters look to the lighting to the costumes to the language to the epic battle at the end where the heroes are hopelessly outnumbered. The plot is very thin, there's no background on how Galbotorix became King other than a brief narrated introduction, th character's are poor with Eragon's journey far too swift, before you know it Eragon has gone from a simple farm boy to the leader of a rebellion who is also a master swordsman & can fly a Dragon. The one aspect of Eragon that is different from The Lord of the Rings is the Dragon, even though one could say the idea is taken from Dragonheart (1996) which was a much better film anyway, instead of a talking Dragon like in Dragonheart here Eragon & his Dragon communicate telepathically which just didn't seem right to me.Even the action scenes are disappointing, the final fight never really gets going & is all but over before it starts & to get a kiddie friendly PG rating there's no real violence or edge to them. The CGI computer effects are alright if not amazing, the makers have given the Dragon a very human face with very human like feature which i thought looked daft. While I am sure the makers thought a human face would be more expressive I want my Dragon's to look like Dragon's you know? To be fair the effects here are no better than those seen in Dragonheart which was made some ten years earlier. At one hour & forty odd minutes the pace is alright but not that much actually happens & it's very predictable simple hero rises to stand against & defeat evil King, I can emphasise who generic & routine Eragon is despite it's huge budget & the talent involved.With a supposed budget of about $100,000,000 a lot was spent on Eragon & it underperformed at the box-office which hopefully means we will be spared a sequel. Mainly filmed in Hungary. The acting is poor, Ed Speleers in particular makes for a very bland hero while Jeremy Irons has the good sense not to stick around until the end. John Malkovich gets about two minutes of screen time & Robert Carlyle looks silly with cracked lips & red eyes as he tries to be intimidating.Eragon is basically a mixture of Dragonheart & The Lord of the Rings & is nowhere near as good as either of them, the Dragon looks too human, the leads are too bland, the action & set-pieces are forgettable & the entire thing feels like one long rip-off trying to ride on the success of another film rather than create it's own.",Eragon
9,CinemaSerf,A good looking action movie to while away an afternoon...,6,9 January 2020,"I quite enjoyed this fantasy adventure. Ed Speleers puts in a decent performance as the pretty-boy hero chosen by a dragon (Rachel Weisz) to be her rider in a battle against the evil shade rather hammily played by Robert Carlyle. Jeremy Irons is a bit of a fish out of water, but helps keep this moving along well enough. The battle scenes at the end are well staged and the SFX are stylish and colourful. The writing is not good - really quite stilted but taken on face value, it's just a bit of boys-own stuff, and quite watchable.",Eragon
10,dbborroughs,Too silly to be believed,4,16 September 2007,"I am not ashamed to say that this movie is way too silly to be believed. What were they thinking? Twenty minutes in Jeremy Irons ends a scene by saying ""Mark my word the age of Dragons will return"" . This is followed by the infamous growing scene where Eragon says ""Maybe the age of Dragons has returned"" which is instantly echoed by the dragon saying ""Yes Eragon the age of Dragons has returned"". At that point I gave up on Eragon never to return. (well I'll try again on cable) Well acted and well made (though John Malkovich is miscast) this movie was doomed at the script and directorial stages. What ever made the book a runaway bestseller seems to have been stripped away and replaced with scenes and shots lifted from other better and worse movies.Yes, the film steals mercilessly from Star Wars, with shots lifted almost exactly from that film and scenes that seem to be paraphrases as well.Its clear director Stefen Fangmeier has an ability to make a film look good but he has no ability to tell a story in a unique way. Its embarrassing, but its not surprising when the director (who never directed anything before) made his name as a effects supervisor, clearly he lifted from the things he knew best- big effects films from the past. I can't entirely blame him since I'm sure that the film was wounded in the script stage with the story being refashioned into a Star Wars clone.This film is best summed up as a warning of the danger of uncreative but workman like types getting their hands on a creative property and sucking the life out of it.Wait for cable",Eragon
11,lastliberal,"That's the spirit - one part brave, three parts fool.",5,17 December 2007,"A combination of Harry Potter and The Lord of the Rings, this could have been a good film. However, the young actor, Edward Speleers, didn't bring much to the table. He just didn't seem to have the magic I was expecting.I actually watched this to see Jeremy Irons (Elizabeth I, Stealing Beauty), Djimon Hounsou (Blood Diamond, Gladiator), and John Malkovich (In the Line of Fire); and to hear the lovely voice of Rachel Weisz (The Constant Gardener), who was the dragon. Irons gave a great performance, and the others in their small roles did as well, so it wan't a total loss.I was also introduced to a star I had previously not noticed: Sienna Guillory (Love, Actually). Have to look for her more.",Eragon
12,zardoz-13,Not Another Second-Rate Sword and Sorcery Saga About A Huff'n Puff Dragon!!!!,2,31 December 2006,"The story behind the sword & sorcery saga ""Eragon"" is far more interesting than the $100 million PG rated Twentieth Century Fox film release. Home schooled as a youth, Montana native Christopher Paolini began writing his 544 page epic at age 15. His parents and he privately published it when he turned 19 to retain all creative and financial power over it. In a Teenreads.Com interview, Paolini deflates his literary success, ""I never intended to become an author; writing ""Eragon"" was just a wild challenge for myself, an attempt to produce a book-length work, without any intention of publishing it. Of course, since it worked out so well, I've continued to pursue it."" Paolini's ultimate triumph with ""Eragon"" occurred through the intervention of another novelist's son. ""The most memorable event, though,"" Paolini says, ""has to be when Carl Hiaasen's stepson bought a copy of ""Eragon"" in Montana and loved it so much, Carl recommended it to an editor at Alfred A. Knopf. This one incident has completely changed my life."" Not only did Alfred Knopf publish the first entry in Paolini's trilogy in 2003, subtitled ""Inheritance,"" but also the publishing giant parlayed this capricious teen-oriented adventure fantasy into a bestseller. Later, in 2005, Knopf acquired Paolini's second installment in the trilogy, a vast 704 page tome, entitled ""Eldest,"" and published it. Not surprisingly, Philip Pullman, Mervyn Peake, J.R.R. Tolkien, Ann McCaffrey, E.R. Eddison, Garth Nix, and Octavia Butler figure among the writers who inspired Paolini. In a Powells.Com interview, Paolini defended fantasy as his choice of the subject matter: ""Life is a give and take between pain and pleasure, suffering and joy. Finding a way to live with dignity is one of the eternal themes of human existence, and . . . writing fantasy is a way to explore that. To try and share with the readers the solutions that you or I have happened to think of to some of those quandaries. It makes reading worthwhile, too.""No, I haven't read Paolini's sprawling novel, but I have seen visual effects-wizard-turned-film director Stefen Fangmeier's lackluster 140-minute adaptation starring newcomer Edward Speleers, Jeremy Irons, Robert Carlyle, Djimon Hounsou, and John Malkovich. Paolini should have credited George Lucas as another source of inspiration, too. The fifteen-year old hero, Eragon (Edward Speleers), lives on his uncle's farm in the mythical realm of Alagaesia, a kingdom once governed by the gallant Dragon Riders. Uncle Garrow (Alun Armstrong of ""The Mummy Returns"") is a single parent who raises his own son along with Eragon.Like Paolini's novel, Peter Buckman's screenplay constitutes an anthology of plot points and character archetypes from millennia of standard-issue mythology. For example, the prologue conjures up Tolkien parallels in its story about a larger-than-life struggle between good and evil and a dubious champion who will deliver all from the tyrannical despotism of its supernatural antagonist. John Malkovich of ""Dangerous Liaisons"" fame plays the insane King Galbatorix with ranting, scenery-chewing exuberance. Sadly, Malkovich's over-the-top villainy is confined to only a few scenes on a single throne set as he barks orders to his dastardly second-in-command, a shade called Durza. Once a noble dragon rider himself, Galbatorix rode the blue skies astride a fire-breathing flying lizard and maintained harmony throughout the empire. However, Galbatorix betrayed his brethren and slaughtered them. Miraculously, Brom (Jeremy Irons of ""Dungeons and Dragons"") survived Galbatorix's massacre. He serves as an Obi-Wan Kenobi type mentor for the unskilled teenage protagonist. The villains in ""Eragon,"" such as the Urgals and Ra'zacs, are the equivalent of the Orcs and Urk-hai in Tolkein's ""Lord of the Rings"" movies. Meanwhile, the sorcerer Durza (Robert Carlyle of ""Trainspotting"" fame decked out like Marilyn Manson) combines facets of Darth Vader from ""Star Wars"" and the draconian Saruman (Christopher Lee) from the ""LTOR"" trilogy.During a hunting trip, our naïve young hero stumbles upon a large dark blue stone about the size of a watermelon. Poor as he is, Eragon tries to exchange it for meat, but the village butcher refuses Eragon's offer. Later, to his surprise, Eragon discovers that the stone is really an egg. Before his eyes, he watches as an adorable baby blue dragon hatches from it. No ordinary young dragon itself, the playful lizard manages to communicate with Eragon through telepathy. Eragon comes to the attention of Brom, and they join forces to dethrone Galbatorix. Meanwhile, Galbatorix's murderous minions are scouring the countryside to find the egg before it hatches. Saphira, as the hatched dragon comes to be called, grows to adulthood in record time, towering 15 feet tall with a wingspan of approximately 30 feet. London-born actress Rachel Weisz of ""Constantine"" provides the Saphira's voice and brings some warmth to the beastie. Comparatively, ""Eragon"" recalls the 1996 fantasy film ""Dragonheart"" about the last dragon (voiced by Sean Connery) and a disheartened dragon-slaying knight (Dennis Quaid) that team up to topple an wicked monarch.Director Stefen Fangmeier and Buchman try to pile a plethora of plot information as well as magical hocus-pocus into this uneven hour and forty minute hokum. Unfortunately, everything comes out sounding either derivative or incoherent. Neither director nor writer does adequate job of giving the leading characters enough screen time and individuality to stand apart from each other. Similarly, the veteran supporting cast finds itself hampered by brevity from making a genuinely memorable impression. Pretty boy Edward Speleers proves that he has a lot to learn about acting before he can rival Mark Hamill in the role of a swashbuckling hero. The sole virtue of ""Eragon"" is Hugh Johnson's sweeping widescreen cinematography with its dizzying aerial footage of Hungary and Slovakia where the filmmakers lensed this hackneyed, superficial fantasy. Overall, the plot with all the usual clichés and conventions unfolds with a predictable, by-the-numbers familiarity that undercuts its sense of spontaneity.",Eragon
13,neil-476,Ho hum fantasy,6,4 April 2010,"I haven't read the source novel but, however bad an adaptation this movie is, I cannot imagine that the source material doesn't include substantial elements drawn from Star Wars episodes 4 to 6, and The Lord Of The Rings. There's nothing wrong with mining other sources but, if you do, you need to be very, very good indeed in order to ensure that you make those familiar elements into something original (Harry Potter is the obvious example).Eragon is not very, very good indeed.It's OK. The visuals aren't bad, the effects are OK, Robert Carlyle's makeup is excellent, and he and Jeremy Irons appear to be having fun.But I'm afraid a weary air of having seen it all before hangs over proceedings. Perhaps the books don't signal how derivative they are quite as obviously.",Eragon
14,gradyharp,The Dragon is the Star,5,26 March 2007,"ERAGON is not without its flaws - a weak and corny script, shoddy editing, Swiss cheese story line - but it is also not without some charm. Unfortunately it is in competition with the Harry Potter series, Lord of the Rings, etc etc that seem to flow endlessly out of Hollywood and the foreign markets.The story of a young lad finding a 'jewel' that turns out to be the egg from which a dragon hatches, offering the chance to reestablish dragon flying and the defeat of an evil world works well enough. And the actors who agreed to take on the various roles (Jeremy Irons, Robert Carlyle, John Malkovich, Djimon Hounsou, and Rachel Weisz) complement the newcomers Edward Speleers, Sienna Guillory, Garrett Hedlund and Christopher Egan. But the joy is the hatching of the little dragon that is a masterful piece of animation and from her birth she steals the show. This is not a great movie by any stretch of the imagination, but it does have enough ingredients to play with the imagination. Grady Harp",Eragon
15,DICK STEEL,A Nutshell Review: Eragon,5,13 December 2006,"I'm not sure why many have cited this to be yet another epic fantasy movie in the mould of Lord of the Rings, or even Harry Potter. Perhaps it's the release date, given that all make it to the silver screen toward the end of the year. However, given that the story is based on a novel written by a sixteen year old at the time, the shades of familiarity stem from something on a grander scale. And to me, it's Star Wars: A New Hope.The similarities are obvious. Eragon (Edward Speleers), the farmboy, raised not by his parents, but by his relatives. He learns how to use mystical power bestowed upon him, and has a mentor, Brom (Jeremy Irons), teach him the ways too. The villains wield same capabilities, and they all wear black, seeking to destroy hope. Midway, there's a quest to save Princess Arya (Sienna Guillory), and it all culminates in a huge battle, except that the villains launch the initiative, like the Battle of Hoth rather than Yavin.If that doesn't sound like A New Hope to you, then you'd probably come to enjoy Eragon, the first part of the Inheritance trilogy. However, if you make the connection, then I'd say you'll be pretty much bored as the movie has neither many moments to whip up your adrenaline, and is filled with a number of dialogue that will make you cringe. Perhaps the finale battle is the only saving grace of this movie, but even that has shades of LOTR's attack at Helm's Deep, only that it's on a much smaller scale, and lacking in detail.The cast is quite spectacular, though I'm a bit surprised that Jeremy Irons is in the movie. Some of you would have known he starred in the grand daddy of fantasy realms - Dungeons and Dragons, but unfortunately, that movie bombed. I suppose he's back here to make amends, but unfortunately, he doesn't get much opportunity to do so. Robert Carlyle as chief villain in this installment is your typical over the top overconfident bad guy, and he's the one with the inappropriate funny lines, which seem to repeat themselves over and over again. John Malkovich is a complete waste as the evil King, and as villains, repeat themselves ad nauseam. Perhaps as a hint, the filmmakers have reigned him in to unleash more mayhem in the sequels.Saphira the dragon is designed beautifully enough though, given the last celebrity voiced dragon we saw was in Dragonheart, provided by Sean Connery. But I suspect that the baby dragon will win a lot more hearts than a fully grown one. You can hear those gasps amongst the audience, that should some marketing folk start making the plush toy, it'll sell like hotcakes this Christmas.Eragon clocks in at way under 2 hours, which is hardly material enough to consider it an epic. Given the shortened run time, there are various bits on the character's learning and development of abilities which seemed very rushed and summarized even, making it feel very choppy. However, as with all first films of the trilogy, it's the establishment of who's who and what's what, so hopefully, if a sequel pulls through, that it'll be way better than this one.And yeah, it cracked me up upon hearing Saphira (voiced by Rachel Weisz) stating that she needed a rider. Ha!",Eragon
16,siderite,"An average book, a horrible movie",6,31 March 2007,"I enjoyed reading the first two Eragn books, not because they were extraordinary, but because they were so clearly fantasy books, unapologetic an drawing most of its good points from other stories. You read it, you feel good, you get to work.The same can be said for the first part of the movie, and when I heard the narration of Jeremy Irons, I thought ""Oh, it will be like another Dungeons and Dragons movie"". By the way, I liked those too, for the same reasons I liked the Eragon book. But soon enough, from trying to squeeze in as much of the book as possible, the screenplay went further and further away from the spirit of the book, then just got lost. It went really bad, then completely crashed.I could tell that the movie failed completely when I could clearly read on Robert Carlyle ""What am I doing? How did I get here?"". Then his character died.John Malkowich appears in three scenes, basically saying the same thing three times. Djimon Honsou also appears three times, but kind of in the same time period, so it's like a long scene. Edward Speelers is hopeless, as is Rachel Weisz, who sounded like she was reading all her lines while drinking in bed.Bottom line: Dungeons and Dragons was better. Read the book. Stay away from the movie.",Eragon
17,Smells_Like_Cheese,"Cute, but nothing special",6,15 December 2006,"My mom and I saw the theatrical trailer for Eragon and we were so excited because we love dragon movies and it looked so cool. Not to mention that we love John Malkovich and Jeremy Irons, so this was a film not to miss. We saw it tonite, opening night, and we were a bit confused by the theater's audience, most were children, we thought it would be kind of a Lord of the Rings movie, guess we were wrong. And three things I need to get out before I tell the story: My gay meter went off when I saw the lead actor, the super duper evil dude needed to brush his teeth, and I now want a baby dragon.Basically Eragon is a boy, well, 17 years old, but he is chosen to be a dragon rider when he finds a dragon egg. When he finds out that he has a fate to lead the dragon into battle and win the war against the evil king played by, big surprise, John Malkovich, and he also has to save a princess who is weak one moment and strong the next. But there is one flaw to having this dragon, if the dragon dies, the dragon dies, but if the rider dies, so does the dragon, so they have to keep each other alive.Well, it has it's hits and misses, I would recommend it for the theater because there were some very cool an impressive effects. But I think maybe I was expecting too much because I wasn't too pleased with how short and dismissive the story was and some of the actors seriously needed to drop the cheesy British accents. But Jeremy and the dragon make this movie worth your while, so judge for yourself.6/10",Eragon
18,Rainey-Dawn,A Nice Family Fantasy,9,1 July 2014,"A good family styled sword and sorcery film fantasy. It captures all the magic and wonder of finding a dragon's egg, raising the creature and becoming a dragon-rider.The movie is kid-friendly so do not expect to see the most powerful, fearsome dragon that you have ever seen. Saphira is more of an enduring dragon that is hard not to love.Also, just because the movie is a family styled film does not mean the story or the overall visuals are not good. It's quite the contrary, Eragon is a captivating story with beautiful visuals and special effects - it is right up there with the ""Harry Potter"" film series.I enjoyed Eragon and will watch it again one day. 9/10",Eragon
19,Robert_duder,From a non literary perspective the film impresses despite heavy flaws,8,22 December 2006,"I have not read Eragon which is perhaps why I find the film quite impressive. I was torn by my decision on what to say about the film because it had a lot of imperfections but at the same time it had a lot of incredible pluses too. Without even a few of those imperfections Eragon could have taken a 10/10 without hesitation but it all comes to down a balance between the pluses and minuses. It seems that those who have read the book despise this film so perhaps they didn't stay too close to it's literary original and I might have felt some of that in the way the put the film together. I think Eragon should have absolutely had a more experienced director as opposed to a first time director like Stefen Fangmeier, although for a first time director I think he did very well. He has had plenty of experience though having worked on special effects on Lemony Snicket, Signs, Terminator 2 and more. I have to give Fangmeier respect for doing a great job on his first act as director. Eragon's cinematography is downright brilliant and the scenes of the dragon are spectacular, jaw dropping even!! The negative aspects of the film come from the inconsistent story, and the rushed plot line. I do understand that the book is enormous and it would be hard to cover all of that in one film but the film still shouldn't suffer because of that. Key elements in the story feel so rushed and tacked together like you're missing entire portions of the story which is really disappointing because what they did leave in is captivating. The Battle scenes are amazing if not a little short but they are easily watchable. Some of the script and non-battle scenes come across as campy but fortunately the good outweighs the bad and the campy scenes don't drag down the rest of the film.The cast is also not the issue in the film. Newcomer Edward Speleers is brilliant as Eragon, the young farm boy destined to greatness as a dragon rider. Speleers has the good looks and soft spoken voice to become a leading man in the future. I think the Eragon film and sequels will land him many roles in the future and I think he'll do well. He is the ideal young hero for this story. Jeremy Irons is absolutely brilliant in his role as the trainer, mentor and former dragon rider. Irons is such a scene stealer and I so badly wanted to see more of his character but it was only natural that he would be killed off far too soon. Irons performance is a 10/10 hands down. Young actress Sienna Guillory plays the imprisoned Princess that calls out to Eragon. There is a small romance brewing there but hardly ever takes flight in this installment anyways. She has a small role and isn't really given anything serious to handle but she does the part fine. Robert Carlyle is a brilliant evil sorcerer who embodies his magics and dark powers and makes a worthy adversary for Eragon right up until the final battle. Carlyle is scary and dark and perfect for the part. John Malkovich plays the leader of the evil side King Galbatorix. Now I have no doubt this character would and will develop over the course of sequels but as far as this performance goes Malkovich is average at best. I always find him a bit egotistical in his performances and quite drab and monotone and this is no exception. I hope they bring him more life in future installments. Finally Rachel Weisz does the voice of the dragon Saphira. Now personally I would have rather the Dragon not talk at all because it's far more intelligent about the world and it's surroundings having been the only dragon in many years. It seems to know everything and Weisz comes across a little droney at times and even campy delivering her lines which kind of wrecks the feel of the film. I don't think it's necessarily her fault as I know she is a terrific actress but voice acting might not be for her.I do believe that the screen writer and director and everyone else truly put their best effort into this film trying to capture and the story and jump start a brilliant epic trilogy or more but in doing that they lost the importance of this current story because it constantly feels like more is to come and it never delivers in just one film. Despite brilliant scenery, some amazing battles, and great characters and actors the film feels slapped together like you're missing entire portions that never made it to film. The tiny baby dragon grows up in seconds after flying into a lightning storm and returns to Eragon speaking, full grown and knows everything there is to know. The climax of the film never truly climaxes because the climax has been saved for a future film and that is this films flaw. As I said I have not read the book but for what it's worth this was a decent, well made and very watchable, clean, 10+ fantasy adventure. Granted there were no elves, dwarfs or many creatures at all but they did their best I think. Experience, bigger budget, and better writing could have turned this into a brilliant film. As for constant comparisons to Lord Of The Rings, and Star Wars...I don't see it...I mean it has as much in common with those films as any film in this genre would have. If I make a film in New York does that mean it's identical to World Trade Center?? Or I make a film about an elf does that make it Lord of The Rings rip off?? I think people are too harsh and need to let go of the comparisons and enjoy this magical light adventure. 8.5/10 (and strongly so)",Eragon
20,Edvis-1997,5,5,9 March 2021,"It's just very basic and boring. Not 1/10, as some people giving, I don't know why tho( if you want to see 1/10 go watch The cat in the Hat). Main idea of this particular movie didn't surprise me, it wasn't something unique. The dragon,let's call him dragon, didn't even look convincing. I could say acting was the best part of this film but that's all.",Eragon
21,MLDinTN,i really like dragons...,5,1 November 2007,"but that isn't enough to turn this movie into something special like the Lord of the Rings films. The special effects are very good, but the story wasn't all that. It felt to rushed and too much was put into a 100 minute movie. I'm sure a lot of things were left out from the book. Even the bad guys seemed like a copy cat from something from LOTR. And the princess in this had very little to do. What was the point.We see the evil King in the beginning, then he disappears from the rest of the film. The main bad guy is a sorcerer, Durza. He almost seems comical.FINAL VERDICT: Visually, the dragon was awesome, and the plot does make sense. But not enough happens and lot must have been left out of the book.",Eragon
22,g-bodyl,"Not Bad, But Not Great!",7,3 May 2008,"In the movie itself, Eragon is not a bad movie. Once you think about the book and the movie plots, things begin to go downhill. Eragon is about a farmer boy named Eragon who finds a ""stone"". The ""stone"" eventually turned out to be a dragon egg. If the evil kingdom finds out Eragon has the egg, it's doom for him and his family. As the movie goes on, the king discovers who has the egg and pursues him. Also, Eragon as a Rider must stop the king and his followers like the Shade. Movie-wise, the film is good. The acting was fine with Edward Speleers and Jeremy Irons. In the Varden scenes, there should've been more Ajihad and Hrothgar cameos and dialog. Rachel Weisz is fantastic as the dragon, Saphira. The special effects are good, but not overwhelming. The scenery is beautiful as with most fantasy movies. Now there are two big negatives. One is that the movie is too short. But that ties in with my second thought. What happened to most of the book? There are over 50 differences between the book and movie with most of them major differences. I was very disappointed in this regard when I saw Eragon. Overall, this is good. I rate this film a 7/10.",Eragon
23,CuriosityKilledShawn,Hopeless trash,3,17 December 2006,"I got all of the Star Wars, Lord of the Rings, Harry Potter and Dungeons and Dragons movies and rudely mashed them together after individually raping them in every orifice then you would get something that resembles Eragon (even the title is a rip-off of Aragorn from LOTR), a film so hopelessly incompetent that even something as basic as lip-syncing is off in almost every scene.Edward Speelers plays the personality-free title character. A young farm boy who is actually the only hope for a bunch of rebels...taken over the land of Alagesia...the chosen one...evil king...sorcerers, elves, orks, dwarfs...blah blah blah. God, I'm boring myself to tears. Speelers has about as much charisma as a lump of dung. And his forced, well-spoken English really got on my nerves.As much as some of the CGI was nice to look at, it just lacks the fantastical element that films such as Dragonslayer delivered so strongly. And the look and feel of the environments was utterly without any sense of atmosphere.And on top of that, there wasn't really anything happening in the film. A brief, unexciting battle scene at the end is the only action you will see in this movie. The rest of the 105 minute running time is just people riding horses. You think I am kidding? John Malkovich (who, by the looks of things, did a single days work) is wasted as the moronically named Galbatroxix or is it Galbathrax or Ozorganax or...something. The evil King! The King who is evil because he...just is. He sits in a dark chamber all day. Christ, how more evil than that can you possibly get. Jeremy Irons is the only good thing in it but he really is slumming it here. As is Rachel Weisz and Robert Carlisle as some sort of trans-sexual zombie wizard. None of them look like they are happy.It's a complete waste of time. Don't be fooled by the colorful posters and TV spots. It's a really terrible film indeed!",Eragon
24,UniqueParticle,Feels like it's lacking so much,4,10 May 2020,"I don't really read much but I feel like Eragon could've been over 2 hours, feels very rushed. Jeremy Irons and Rachel Weiz are great although Rachels voice doesn't seem to be in it enough ;Ed Steelers doesn't seem like a good actor too like he started with this. Below average film best thing about it is the different color scenes and the courage involved! Sloppy writing and acting is a huge let down too!",Eragon
25,paulclaassen,"Sorcerers, dragons, dragon hunters and ogres...what's not to enjoy!",6,9 August 2021,"It's interesting to see most critics disliked 'Eragon', yet the film was a box office success, proving the general public enjoyed it.Ed Speleers stars as the film's titular character, Eragon, whom I thought did a good job as the protagonist. He had a likability that made me root for him. Eragon's life is thrown into turmoil when he finds a mysterious rock in the woods, which turns out to be a dragon egg. The set-up of the dragon and Eragon being able to communicate via mind reading was a bit much to swallow, but I suppose it was required for the movie to work the way they wanted it to. This aspect will appeal more to a young audience who watches cartoons, while a mature audience might find this amusing, to say the least, and raise an eyebrow or two.I enjoyed Jeremy Irons as Brom, who's character has an interesting reveal later. John Malkovich was born to portray villains. Unfortunately, here, he isn't given much to do with a seriously underdeveloped character, Galbatorix. This character has so much potential, yet all he did in the few moments he was on screen, was give orders. He was a passive character who might as well not have been there.The real antagonist is Shade. Shade is more of an entity or spirit than an actual character, but it was creepy at times. The film features beautiful cinematography and great visuals, with a very realistically designed dragon. With sorcerers, ogres, dragons, dragons riders, what's not to enjoy here - if you're into fantasy, off course. This is an enjoyable fantasy adventure, with a stunning final battle scene. It was also nice to only have a subtle hint at romance, instead of a love interest intervening in the action, as is the case with most (Hollywood) films of this genre.",Eragon
26,filipemanuelneto,Open ending and the bad protagonist spoil the movie.,5,31 October 2017,"When I watched this movie I was a bit thoughtful. It reminded me a lot of a B version of ""Lord of the Rings"" or something like that. After some research, I discovered that it is based on Christopher Paolini's books. In fact, after blockbusters like ""Harry Potter"" or ""Lord of the Rings"", literature and cinema were filled with fantasies. On the other hand, the studios bet so high on these films that they try to force the making of trilogies and franchises. This is quite evident in this film, with its open ending announcing a sequel that wasn't made.The script is simple: a magical land was ruled by knights mounted on dragons and everything went well until they became corrupted, fought each other and one of them betrayed all the others, killing everyone and becoming a dictator. Now comes a new warrior, who must be able to unite the resisters and lead the revolt against him. Simple and predictable most of the time, the film never proves to amaze or move us. In fact, it's usually empty and insensitive, with a promise of romance that never materializes and the almost total absence of emotions. Even action scenes seem so unrealistic that we never feel real danger (partly because there isn't much empathy with the characters, so we never care about them).Ed Speleers is a stranger to me and is still very young, so I don't understand why they didn't hire a more experienced actor. It was a casting mistake and he was never up to the character. Jeremy Irons is excellent in his role and stars in some of the best scenes in the film. Rachel Weisz was competent in the task of giving voice to the dragon, Saphira. On the other hand, John Malkovich looks a lot like himself and Sienna Guillory was unlucky with her character, whose importance we will never know because the film would only reveal it in the sequel. I believe that the bad casting options and low acting performances is due to the bad material given to the actors. Another problem I felt was the editing of the film, which made it's rhythm rather irregular, with a lot of dead moments. Technical features, however, compensate these weaknesses: CGI's good and cinematography, colorful and bright, is a feast for our eyes. The choice of sets and the design of costumes were judicious and everything was thought to the smallest detail. The soundtrack, without being amazing, performs very well and suits what we are seeing on screen.""Eragon"" might have been much more interesting if they had made this film without thinking about sequels and if they had put in the main role another actor, more skilled in the task of showing feelings and gaining our empathy. Despite being a forgettable film and not deserving of being considered good, its regular enough to be watchable.",Eragon
27,BaronBl00d,It's Not THAT Bad!,5,11 April 2007,"I first have to confess that I never read the book or even knew it was a relatively famous series of novels prior to seeing this film. I am the first to relate my disappointment with the film version of a book - especially if it is way off center of the spirit of the book. My opinion therefore is that of someone who has never read the books and just went in thinking he was going to see a fantasy film. When looked at at that level, Eragon is not all that bad. It has some top-notch special effects and decent acting. The story is pretty convoluted but there is so much action that one doesn't have terribly too much time to figure out what is going on. Many reviewers preceding me have gone in great detail and depth over the plot and how poor it is in comparison to the books. I am sure they are absolutely right. For me, again having never read any of it, I picked up most of what was going on, enjoyed the special effects, and was overall entertained by Jeremy Irons and the rest of the cast - even the very small role given to John Malkovich and the obvious invitation to a sequel. If I had read, I am sure I would mirror most viewers disgust. I guess sometimes ignorance is indeed bliss.",Eragon

I realize there are problems with this adaptation, but I must agree with other reviewers in that this story was obviously a total rip off of the base Star Wars plot, with a medieval setting tacked on, in the first place, so I don't CARE that this particular movie wasn't like the book. In fact, I found that a plus.The characters were enigmatic, unlike the written work. The dragon was awesome, unlike the written work. All the idiotic nonsensical details which did not mesh with one another were absent, and the story was amazingly coherent, considering the source material from whence this was drawn.I thoroughly enjoy this work, and will watch it again, and again. The book? I couldn't stand the amateurish lack of style, the lack of demonstration of vocabulary, or the inability to string together a coherent paragraph. Sorry book fans. I hated the book. When I read others' reviews screaming how NOT like the book this was, I bought the DVD sight unseen, and LOVED it.It rates an 8.6/10 from...the Fiend :.",Eragon
30,dwpollar,Fun and interesting to watch fantasy movie...,7,17 December 2006,"1st watched 12/17/2006 - 7 out of 10(Dir-Stefan Fangmeier): Fun and interesting to watch fantasy movie about a young boy who comes upon the egg of a soon-to-be-born dragon and then his world changes. He is christened as the next dragon-rider in a land that had been without dragons or dragon-riders for many years. Jeromy Irons plays the last dragon rider and kind of takes the boy in on his own to mentor him. These characters are only part of a big world that is headed-up by an evil king, played flawlessly by John Malkovich, which is aching for goodness to stick out it's head and prevail. Supposedly when dragon-riders and dragons ruled the world, things were much better and when the evil leaders find out about the new dragon & rider they go about their business to send their evil hordes out after them to kill them. The problem is that it's not as easy as they had hoped. The good characters have a quest to get to the land where the rest of the rebel forces are located and once they get there they will shoulder up their forces to take on the evil king and his army. For the most part this is a well-done movie that does a good job of telling it's story and presenting the characters. The ending wreaks of sequel-dom and is lessened in it's impact due to this, in my opinion. The last ½ hour's fighting sequences are less than realistic and for some reason once the Irons character is gone the movie turns sour a little bit. But besides this, the dragon is well-done both as an essential character and as an animated being and the story keeps your interest up to the very end. I don't think the question is whether this movie will have a sequel but instead when will it be in the theaters and is it already prepared for us.",Eragon
31,Enchorde,Try again...,4,9 January 2011,"Recap: A farm boy discovers accidentally that he is the answer to an old prophecy, he is the last dragonrider, the only that can challenge the evil emperor and bring balance to the force (oh sorry... wrong movie, or?). Anyway, Eragon must learn quickly to harness the power he possesses and ride his dragon, or the emperors armies will find the rebel hideout and wipe them out. And of course there is a beautiful princess to rescue...Comments: Well apart from being lending far too much of the story from other famous movies, mostly notably Star Wars, this movie is still not very good. Stories have inspired each other before, and some have lent or stolen elements before. Or plucked the entire thing. But that is not really anything new. The real problem though, is that having lent so much of the story, the characters seem phony. There is no depth to them, no history, no emotion at all. So it is extremely hard sympathize or even connect to them. Especially Eragon, he actually annoys me. And when the lead character is annoying you, the movie is in real trouble.Some good effects though, and some solid veteran actors try to save what they can with the little they have to work with. Actually there are surprisingly many (usually) good actors in the movie. The cast list includes Irons, Malkovich (screen time about a minute?), Carlyle and Hounsou among others. That is actors that I like normally. In this I can't get myself to really care.Well. Every try to make an ambitious fantasy movie with a real budget, good effects and known actors is welcome. But with this they have to try again...",Eragon
32,Rob_Taylor,"Era...going,,,,going......gone",5,13 November 2007,"Well, as someone who has not read the books yet, I can say that I have mixed feelings about this film. I do have preconceptions, however, just not one's from the book. My preconceptions stem from comparing this movie to what I regard as the pinnacle of fantasy movies to date, namely, The Fellowship of the Ring by Peter Jackson. Unfortunately, in comparing this movie to that one I have to report that things aren't particularly favourable.For a start...John Malkovich. Whoever gave him the script also clearly told him to overact the part atrociously. He chews up the scenery at a ferocious rate of knots. Its actually quite embarrassing to watch.There is also the costume debacle. Whilst the main characters seem to be reasonably well catered for, there are more than a few whiffs of ""Hercules and Xena"" about the extras garb.Jeremy Irons, for once (and I can scarcely believe it myself) acts really well. Of late he seems to get parts that specify ""overact badly"" but here he gave a very good showing.Robert Carlyle, likewise is rather prone to overact as Durza, the evil wizard. I didn't even recognise him under the make-up, so I guess kudos to the cosmetics department for that one.As to the plot, others have already remarked the Star Wars Ep 4 similarities, so I won't go there. Allowing for the ""Farmboy-becomes-hero"" mentality the plot moves along quite nicely. There are a couple of things I just didn't get. I'm guessing that, if I had read the books, I'd get even less of what was going on, judging by the comments here. But on the whole it seemed to work.But....and this is the biggest BUT of them all....as a whole, it just didn't really do anything for me. Overall, the effect of the film, even with the CGI and everything, played out like some 80's sword and sorcery movie. And not so much even a Beastmaster movie....more like a Beastmaster 2. There was no depth to the world portrayed in the movie at all. It all looked like any other fantasy movie you might care to mention. In other words, nothing special or outstanding about it.In short it's hard to recommend this movie to anyone except the most die-hard of fantasy or dragon fans. And when the best thing you can say about a fantasy film is ""It's better than the Dungeons and Dragons movie"" that really isn't saying a lot at all.",Eragon
33,pc95,No Trailblazing Here,5,19 October 2008,"I thought Lord of the Rings Trilogy was for the most part overrated. Now a few years down the line we have ""Eragon"" screaming to be like it's big-brother series while mostly failing. Unfortunately, we've seen most everything it has to give...it is a massive-budgeted cliché. It has some good production points and Jeremy Irons vehemently throws his weight into all the acting and story, but the story and script has all been done before by Conan, Lord of the Rings, Willow etc etc....plus the lead is rather irritating. What's done well? The dragon CGI is decent, some of the settings evoke good atmosphere - Robert Carlyle as shade has some interesting bad vibes - but ho hum! This movie obviously hasn't been planned out or edited well enough evidenced by a laugher ending trying to set up a sequel.....worth watching only if you're a die-hard fantasy nut and even then be ready to be disappointed.",Eragon
34,winner55,humorless 'Dragonheart',6,12 January 2008,"Let's be honest - this film is true to its genre, and is relatively more interesting than many. It's not all that bad; the FX are good, the acting pretty good, the dialog cliché but acceptable. The pacing is also OK and all other aspects of the film are more than tolerably professional.The problem is, no matter what its professed source material (a fantasy novel with cult status) - the film is a less cohesive, less amusing, and strangely less humane, remake of ""Dragonheart"" - uncredited, of course. And let's also face this: although only slightly above the level of a B-Movie, Dragonheart is very entertaining, with characters we come to love (including the dragon) and a strong plot derived from the Arthurian sagas of the later Middle ages.If you're going to remake a film like Dragonheart - a top of the line B-Movie adventure story - you've got to bring something new to the table.Unfortunately, ""Eregon"" doesn't.",Eragon

Starring Ed Speleers, Jeremy Irons, Sienna Guillory, Robert Carlyle, Garrett Hedlund, John Malkovich, Djimon Hounsou, Gary Lewis, Alun Armstrong, Chris Egan, Joss Stone, (voice) Rachel Weisz. (PG)Depressingly derivative sword & sorcery yarn finds an orphaned farm boy (Speleers) ""destined"" to become a dragon rider when an egg lands in his lap one day. In no time at all, the hatched beast is fully grown and ready to spirit the bland hero off on a grand adventure, with a seasoned mentor (Irons), a princess in need of saving (Guillory), and a lone rogue warrior on hand to be flashy yet unflappable (Hedlund); if those ""Star Wars"" similarities aren't convincing enough, consider how much dark wizard Carlyle resembles Emperor Palpatine towards the end of the movie. Any chance of it being a familiar-but-fun fantasy mash-up (à la ""Willow"") disappears quickly, since it's also generic, lifeless, weakly-acted, flatly-directed and entirely uninvolving. Scenery looks nifty at times, but the dragon design is anything but easy on the eyes, with weirdly human characteristics on the face and mouth, and Weisz's unsuitably lovely voice coming out of it via awkward telepathy. The opportunity for paycheck-cashing Irons and Malkovich to ham it up is squandered as well--can't it at least be bad in a fun way?

36,KUAlum26,Familiar stuff,6,24 December 2006,"Since I have absolutely NO knowledge or understanding of the Christopher Paolini novels,I went into this movie completely tabula rasa. Maybe that's why I could appreciate(albeit not extremely enthusiastically)this film.The story of young Eragon(newcomer Ed Speelers,who looks strangely retro,physically)who discovers his destiny as a ""Dragon rider"",a warrior/protector who once covered the world as mythic figures,only to be eliminated due to a war between and among them. Eragon's possession and abilities as a Rider threaten the despotic King Galbatorix(a sneering John Malkovich,getting WAY less screen time than usual),and he dispatches Trogolodyte-like soldiers commandeered by his adviser and chief lieutenant,a Shade(or ghost-like mystic with unworldly powers)named Durza(Robert CArlyle,unrecognizable in Ozzy Osbourne-like make-up). Helping the young rider are a mysterious elder named Bram(Jeremy Irons,brooding and dark par usual),Anya the warrior princess(Sienna Guillary)and an archer named Roran(Christopher Egan)and,of course Eragon's dragon Safira(voiced by Rachel Weisz).This film has a great look: the dragon,the wide-angle shots and landscapes are GREAT. But the acting,with the exception of Irons,seems pretty wooden. This film(And I am accurate in saying the novel?)seems VERY familiar in subject matter,plot,characters,action,etc. and while that in and of itself isn't anything wrong,this film seems to lack much identity of its own. If it's just a pure mythic medieval ""Dragons-and-Swords"" movie,then this film should satisfy. If you want what should be a accurate usage of established source material(and again,I say this as someone who has no real appreciation for the novels this movie and its sequel are based on),then I'm afraid this might come up short.

37,Sirus_the_Virus,"Long ago, in a film far from L.O.T.R., Harry Potter and Narnia.",6,5 August 2009,"Eragon was written by a fifteen year old. I can seriously see now after seeing the film. Eragon is a ripoff of Lord of the Rings, Harry Potter(sort of), Narnia(sort of) and Dragonheart. I almost liked Eragon, but I think it's silly. There are many flaws in Eragon that I can't even name. The film has a good cast, good special effects, some good acting, and that's it. I've only seen Eragon three times. I haven't seen it for a couple of years though. I don't remember much about it, despite the fact that there are sooooo many actors and actresses. Here's the list of people who are in it: Jeremy Irons(The Lion King, Die Hard with a Vengeance) Sienna Guilroy(Inkheart, a cameo in Love Actually) John Malkovich(In the line of fire, Burn after Reading) Rachael Weisz(as the voice of the dragon)(The Mummy, The Constant Gardener) Djimon Hounsou(Blood Diamond, Never Back Down) That cast is what saves this movie. Eragon isn't an awful film. But it's no Lord of the Rings, Harry Potter, or Narnia. It's an imitation of the three series'. I give it a mild recommendation, though if you're looking for something as good as Harry Potter, Lord of the Rings, or Narnia, you've come to the wrong place.",Eragon
38,mentalcritic,From a mediocre vanity-published novel comes a lousy film,2,19 April 2007,"When I first heard of Eragon, I heard of it as a work of vanity publishing by a teenaged author who had copped way too much Star Wars. So when I saw that a film had been hastily made to cash in on the fantasy film trend that emerged in the wake of the disappointing Lord Of The Rings films, I decided I would wait for it to emerge on DVD. Having read some of the complaints by fans of the novel, I can say I am glad that I never read the novel. For even if you discount the myriad of cited differences between novel and film, Eragon just does not make a very good film or story at all. The irony here is that a few nights prior to viewing, I happened across a listing of science fiction clichés, many of which also apply to the fantasy genre. They were ranked by how tired they were, and the funny thing is that Eragon resorts to so many that simply do not work unless one uses their creative ability to put a unique spin on them. The problem here being that if uniqueness were money, Eragon could not afford to buy potatoes.The plot, such as it is, revolves around a land under the rule of a tyrannical empire. In ages past, the land was kept safe by a select group of mystics who had a unique ability to ride dragons. But one dragon rider turned against them and wiped almost all of them out. Whether the ability to ride dragons is heritable is not really explored in the film, but our central hero is among one of the few remaining. If you do not think this plot sounds familiar, that is because you were hiding under a rock during the years in which it was literally impossible to escape publicity for the Star Wars films. And that is only the most obvious example I could name. David Lynch's adaptation of Dune was doubtlessly seeing a lot of time on Peter Buchman's display unit, too. But as I said, reusing ideas that are now so old they are being taught in public schools is forgivable if one puts new and unique twists upon them. The problem in Eragon is that this iteration of the story does anything but.Another problem for the film is that the world depicted is very shallow at best, furthering the copycat feeling of the story. We know as much regarding the motives of every character at the end of the film as we did at the beginning. In some cases less. We are told that Robert Carlyle's character is a Shade, but without having seen these creatures in other films or roleplaying sourcebooks, one would be hard-pressed to understand exactly what this means. And to be quite honest, since these creatures are rarely used outside of a Dungeons & Dragons sourcebook, it was all too easy for the writer to change the character's abilities or weaknesses to suit the needs of the plot. Which is exactly what it feels like they did during every scene in the film. A Star Wars equivalent would be giving Darth Vader the ability to breathe without machine assistance for more than a handful of seconds because he needed to do this in order to kill the Emperor. It is lazy writing that makes one even more reluctant to bother with the novel. It is truly a credit to Robert Carlyle that the character has any menace to him at all.You will notice that I have yet to mention any of the heroes. That is because with the exception of Jeremy Irons trying to avoid comparisons to Alec Guiness, none of the heroes of this film are worthy of mention. The only one given enough development time to even resemble Luke Skywalker is the titular dragon rider, and I never thought I would hear myself say that the Luke Skywalker of A New Hope seems far more grown up. As with Carlyle, Eragon is given sudden and unexplained new abilities whenever the plot paints itself into a corner that it cannot escape without them. And this is probably the worst thing one can do in fantasy writing. Without a consistent set of rules to govern the world the characters inhabit, everything falls apart. A good ten minutes for someone to explain what the dragon riders can do and why would have anchored the plot a bit more firmly in the viewer's mind. The problem from the writers' point of view is that once they had done this, they would also be less free to change the rules at their leisure to suit the needs of their story.And with a cast of characters that nobody gives a damn about once the most charismatic or developed die, the whole thing falls down like a house of cards. Sienna Guillory and Edward Speleers are incapable of carrying a film on their own. Robert Carlyle could have carried the film if it had focused more on him, but that would have required a character as dynamic and well-written as Darth Vader, which Durza is anything but. John Malkovich looks truly bored to be playing Galbatorix, which I do not doubt he was given that he has previously appeared in films where people get sucked into a portal within his head. By comparison to other works Carlyle, Malkovich, and Irons appear in, Eragon is so pedestrian and lame that it is barely any wonder that even Carlyle occasionally appears to be phoning in his performance. The rest of the cast have not the skill nor the experience to see that they are fighting a terrible script, and thus they deliver earnest performances that are undercut at every second by the copycat script.I gave Eragon a rating of two. It is truly cash-in film-making at its worst. See it for an example of how trends can destroy innovation.",Eragon
39,ElijahCSkuggs,Errorgons,5,15 December 2006,"This review is mainly for people who have read the book.First off, I personally really enjoyed the book, so I had high hopes for this flick. But as a bigger movie fan than book lover I knew better than to let my hopes get too high. Which is why I didn't hate this movie, but I can tell you I certainly didn't enjoy it. Eragon seems incredibly old hat, like a movie mixed with about five others together. It's also filled with problems that should have Paolini a little frustrated. Even if you didn't read the book, and you're even a little on the ball, you can predict almost everything that happens in this first installment of the trilogy.The lead actor who plays Eragon is probably the next big thing for middle schoolers across the nation. Unfortunately he's only a face with no real acting skills. Sure he can pretend to cry or act outraged, big whoop. Saphira was fine I suppose, she roared and made snappy remarks when needed. The rest of the cast was fine also, with Irons probably being the one who delivered the lines the best. The Urguls and Razac were absolutely great in the book but in this they are pretty damn weak. Urguls are supposed to be huge hulking monsters, but in this they are played by large men with tattoos and red eyes. And the Razac are supposed to be talkative, birdlike creatures who eat humans. They looked more like a member of Slipknot combined with Scarecrow from Batman Begins. If you're going into this movie, please try to dismiss everything you know about the book. Then and only then will you possibly enjoy it. The movie is at least pretty nice looking, CGI is a little too much sometimes, but it is definitely a vibrant looking film.With all that being said, it's easy to say if you're in middle school or you aren't a huge movie buff/critic, and you enjoyed Chronicles of Narnia, you will most likely enjoy Eragon.",Eragon
40,vip_ebriega,Drag-on tales.,2,24 May 2008,"My Take: The special effects dragon, voiced by Rachel Weisz, is livelier than anyone in this sleazy, tedious fantasy adventure. ERAGON is based on the book by teenager Christopher Paolini, and I haven't read the book yet, but by judging of the movie, it might take a while before I do. ERAGON, as a film, is a completely unoriginal and almost totally tedious attempt at fantasy. I'm not exactly anticipated when this film came out, I now, as I've seen it, I now have the right to be disappointed. The film has very few, if nearly no, new ideas of its own, and owes immensely for taking so much more from George Lucas' STAR WARS. Now, all we need is an R2-D2 and C-3PO knock-off and you have a reason for George Lucas to file a lawsuit. How much can you take from other films within 104 minutes of screen time? Everything seems to be lifted from STAR WARS, from the fact that the lead character is in fact a farm boy, a boy named Eragon (Edward Speelers in his debut) who finds a strange rock-like object which is actually a dragon egg, who is recruited for a mission to fight an evil entity bent on total domination. By now, it has occurred to you that this is almost like Luke Skywalker and his fight with the evil Empire. Completing the total derivativeness of the plot is his mentor named Brom (Jeremy Irons), who talks, walks and breaths old Ben Kenobi. With all his talks about Eragon's mission and duties, it makes you want to think the writer watched STAR WARS way too much.I can go on this forever, whether it's Eragon insisting to save the elf princess Arya (Sienna Guillory) despite the reluctance of his master, or the dragon-rider must be ""one"" with his dragon (change ""dragon"" to ""lightsaber"" and it's fairly obvious), ERAGON hasn't a good idea in its bag. Heck, they even ripped-off the famous STAR WARS scene with the the two moons! If this is the nature of the book, why bring it to the big screen where it has to compete with the real thing? As directed by Stefen Fangmeier, a special effects artist in his directorial debut, ERAGON is doing well when it comes to special effects. The dragon isn't something new in special effects wizardry, but it still looks fine. The voice of Rachael Weisz as the dragon Saphira is the only films' highlight, managing to keep her credibility. Otherwise, ERAGON is still a completely bare-bones fantasy epic, big on budget yet completely empty. Yet another fact that not all books don't spell blockbuster hits. Rating: * out of 5.",Eragon
41,educallejero,5??????????????????????????????????????????? Are you all crazy?,1,16 August 2018,"Let alone Lord of the Rings... NOTHING of this is deserving of praise. NOTHINGThis seems like a scam. ""Someone would think this might be as good as LOTR""",Eragon
42,fwomp,Screeching In Dismay,3,8 May 2007,"ERAGON is one of those films that makes Sci-Fi and Fantasy lovers cringe. It is plainly a horrifically done adaption of Christopher Paolini's book by the same name, slashing vital plots into nothingness, showing forced performances by some the best actors of our time (the most noteworthy being John Malkovich), and producing a main character (Eragon played by Edward Speelers) who grows too fast and is rarely sympathetic in the short 104 minutes of the entire film.Note that time: 104 minutes. Chris Paolini wrote Eragon as a sort of epic, brandishing derivative works such as Tolkien's LORD OF THE RINGS series and McCaffrey's DRAGONRIDERS OF PERN stories. But Paolini was only fifteen when he started writing it, so quite a bit of leeway was given to him because of youthful inexperience. He did create an interesting world, but the book was lukewarm at best (in my opinion) yet sparked the imagination of younger readers. Perhaps his book could be considered a gateway to the more in-depth novels by Tolkien, McCaffrey, and the other great fantasy authors. Regardless, his ""epic"" was slashed to 104 minutes ...although the ending of this movie certainly leaves it open for a sequel even though there's NOTHING on the film radar/horizon to suggest one is coming. Which pretty much leaves this flick dead in the water. Dropping off plots in order to wedge the story into a certain time-frame for a certain audience has proved disastrous time after time. THE LORD OF THE RINGS movies (178 min., 179 min., and 201 min. respectively), THE CHRONICLES OF NARNIA (143 min.) and many, many other lengthy films proved this. Although they did make alterations to the literary works, they kept almost all of the plots intact. Of course longer movies mean more costs for the production studio, too.So the first big strike against Eragon is its short length in comparison to the depth the novel gave us.The second is the acting. When the best job is done by a CGI character who's voiced by Rachel Weisz (THE CONSTANT GARDNER), you know there's a problem. Her Saphira voice-over is done well, leaving all the other actors/actresses in the dust. Although Jeremy Irons (CASANOVA) does a middlin' job as the old dragonrider Brom, it most certainly isn't his most shining moment on celluloid. Many of his lines are stilted and sound as if he's afraid to use more than five words in a sentence. From here, the acting takes a serious nosedive into oblivion. Newbie Edward Speelers as Eragon is rip-your-eyes-out bad. You can tell he's trying way to hard to make his character empathetic and interesting but the script wouldn't allow it. Sienna Guillory as the magical Arya is practically unknown to the viewer, never letting us know why she, of all people, is carrying something so important through such a dangerous land. Robert Carlyle as the dastardly Duza is probably the most forced evil character you'll ever see, making you laugh at him more than fear him.The best quality within the movie was the CGI. The images were rendered exceptionally well and the dragon Saphira has a very authentic look to her (which was good considering how much time she's on screen).If you loved Paolini's Eragon novel, you'll probably screech in dismay at this adaption. If you didn't, you'll probably screech in dismay anyway.",Eragon
43,FloatingOpera7,For Fans Of The Eragon Novels,10,16 December 2006,"Eragon (2006): Edward Speleers, John Malkovich, Jeremy Irons, Sienna Guillory, Rachel Weisz, Robert Carlyle, Garrett Hedlung, Gary Lewis, Alan Armstrong, Christopher Egan, Richard Rifkin, Joss Stone, Steve Speirs, Tamsin Egerton, Mate Haumann, Caroline Chikezie, Andrea Fazekas, Agnes Banfalvy, Pal Makrai, Spencer Wilding, GAbor Hortobagy. Director Stefen Fangmeier, Screenplay Peter Buchman.This is the long-awaited film adaptation of Christopher Paolini's Eragon novels. Paolini began writing the books at the age of 17. To some, this film is heaven, especially if you are drawn to the mainstream fantasy genre. To others, this film appears to be full of the predictable ""Lord of the Rings"" type of material and nothing special. Peter Buchman wrote the screenplay (perhaps a big mistake) and not Paolini himself, and the film was directed by European director Stefen Fangmeier. The premise: A beautiful world, once governed by benevolent and wise dragon-riders, has fallen under the dark power of a traitor dragon-rider Galbatorix (John Malkovich). The remaining riders, known as the Varden, retreated to a hidden mountain fortress where they await the coming of a hero who will ride a dragon and defeat Galbatorix and his evil dragon. This hero is none other than Eragon, a humble farm boy who happens to find a dragon's egg, changing his life forever. Clearly, there are echoes of both Lord of the Rings and Star Wars here, at least in the rebels vs empire sort of way, which is why some detractors bash this film, but in all fairness, it might be mere coincidence. The dragon is the female Saphira (voice of Rachel Weisz). Before long, Eragon sets off on his quest to defeat the wicked sorcerer Shade (Robert Carlyle) and save the beautiful captive Arya (Sienna Guillory). This is a wonderful fantasy film, though not a faithful and loving tribute to Paolini's novel, thanks to the Hollywood signature on it- namely the dazzling special effects and computer enhanced imagery, such as the dragon itself. But the cinematography by Hugh Johnson is breathtaking. The vistas of nature- thick forests, mountains, waterfalls, etc- make this film a winner in my opinion. The original music by Patrick Doyle is both intense and touching. So, even if you've had enough of Lord of the Rings or Chronicles of Narnia, both series which have fared well in the box-office, you might just find yourself enjoying Eragon.",Eragon
44,rajdoctor,Eragon,4,7 January 2007,"I had read the review of Eragon and knew that the reviews were not very good, but still because I had gone to the city for some work and did not know what to do after going home, I decided to see this movie.The movie was a fantasy tale about an evil king who ruled a kingdom and only one person who is a dragon riders can destroy his empire, but there are none dragons and dragon riders remaining in this kingdom. The movie starts with the birth of a dragon eggs and the savior of the egg  our hero, and takes forward his journey to realize his power of dragon rider and fight against evil.With this premise, the movie was sure to be a good movie during Christmas times. But the director  with magna opus sets and world class effects does not create those interesting moments to capture audience imagination. To tell you the fact  at one point in the movie I fell asleep. Awakening I thought I was alone sleeping  but I heard a yawn from right side of me and after some time, I saw a person literally dozing on my left side.Surely to state that the movie had some of the most beautiful natural scenes shown on big screen; but one detail pricked my eyes again and again when they showed the close ups of main characters  I could not take my eyes from the closely stitched dresses  some with double stitches etc. I think director should have taken care of this fact.This was the second fantasy movie (first was Kruistocht in Spijkerbroek) I saw that left the ending unfinished  without the evil king not killed; only his deputy was killed in the final action. May be directors are thinking of making a sequel on the success of this movie. With box office collections not showing encouragement  sequel would be difficult to find a producer to fund it.The acting was okay, the biggest disappointment was the main lead character of the boy who plays the dragon rider. He left much passion to be achieved. It looked he is new and had potential but a lot hard work to be achieved if he really wants to create a mark.All in all, an okay movie for time pass  only if you have some spare time and do not know what to do?",Eragon
45,LazySod,"Bleak, bland and boring",5,28 December 2006,"A land reigned by an evil king, a legend that speaks of dragons, rebels, an evil wizard. What else is there in a standard Middle Earth story clone? In Eragon a kid named Eragon finds something that may very well change the future of the country forever: a dragon egg. And thus the film starts, explaining the need to know parts of the background and creating the characters, just like any other film.The film starts slowly, and carries on just like that really - never really picking up speed. It has a few very well looking shots of scenery and all that, but for the most of it I found it a rather bland concoction. Nothing really stands out from the masses of films that run with the same ideas. It wasn't an entirely bad film, just nothing worth remembering.I think the best comparison to make would be to The Chronicles of Narnia, which I found just a notch worse than this one. That one was equally bland and its effects were marginally worse. All in all, I can't recommend this film to anyone, except to those that are very very bored and not able to watch anything much better (like any part of the Lord of the Ring films for instance).5 out of 10 levels of legendary blandness",Eragon
46,Flagrant-Baronessa,Can you tell that this is written by a 15-year-old Star Wars/fantasy fanboy?,4,27 February 2007,"The only way you could respond 'no' to the above is if you've never seen Star Wars. ""Eragon"", based upon the Christopher Paolini novel, begs the question of who greenlit this irrevocable dross. The story of a young dragonrider who has greatness thrust upon him in times of war hovers around iconic fantasy staples such as doomed mentors, fairy-tale princesses, the-uncle-who-is-soon-to-be-dead, rebel alliances and set-ups wholly 'borrowed' from the classics  and when you semi-plagiarize Star Wars, you are truly scraping the barrel. Director Stefen Fangmeier is a CGI-guru of sorts, but his special effects skills never translate onto this product, possibly because there is always too much of it occupying one frame, and naturally only the most eye-catching, flagrant dross is visible, and a potent example of CGI-gone-wrong is Saphira the dragon. There are numerous sweeping, epic, aerial shots of dramatic fantasy landscape, but most of it is far too artificial after it has been filtered through this CGI process and as a result the whole spectacle is noticeably less captivating. The rare, fleeting moments of suspense and poignancy that sweep you up in the film are found in the dragon flying sequences but even they are nothing to write home about.Not to generalize, but even as a fan of the genre I can say that fantasy rarely allows for subtlety. In ""Eragon"" this is unmistakably true. Expect no moral grey zones: here is altogether polarized black-and-white camps with golden-haired heroes and gruesome dark orc-like creatures in dungeons who randomly raid travelers. The one remotely layered character in the story is Jeremy Irons' doomed mentor role, but his fate is just as predictable as the others'. There is your usual stares-in-disbelief protagonist (Edward Speleers), the empowered-butt-kicking-yet-impossibly-womanly-and-fragile rebel warrior-princess, a well-oiled up specimen who finds herself in distress and lastly there are the unnecessarily sinister villain arcs. One of the best parts in the film that kept me going was the rotating scale of shitty acting. When Rachel Weisz first appeared I was convinced her annoyingly in-your-face cutesy attitude was the singular worst thing about the film, but just as I established this my outlook was floored by Sienna Guillory (who I know is at the mercy of an underwritten character, but still), who seemingly reached new levels of unique ham. Then, curiously enough, appeared Djmoun Hounsou who yet again upped the suck-o-meter in acting. This may be a positive feedback loop, for as ""Eragon"" progressed, new, more terrible performances surfaced. In this way, I could not stop watching. I was mesmerized.The PG-rating of the film should be a natural deterrent. It does not suggest that this movie is for kids as much as it suggests that it is not for adults. As such, it traffics in sentimental taglines such as ""without fear there cannot be courage"" and self-referential, recurring dialogue of wisdom. Stefen Fangmeier practices a kind of lead-footed direction here which stumbles along the silly storyline of learning from reluctant-yet-loving mentor, saving the damsel in distress and killing the bad guys, ultimately having fledged itself into the kind of incoherent fantasy outlet a teenager would resort to, sans delicate or layered elements. All good vs. evil.Finally, I will concede that ""Eragon"" does not fully violate code 01 of film-making: it is never boring. On the other hand, it is not exactly gloriously entertaining either (it never reaches the kind of so-bad-it's-good podium its bastard-cousin ""Dungeons and Dragons"" brushed upon) but the sheer scale of the fantasy medium and the brisk pace with which the story moves rarely allows watch-glances or anything of the sort. I can safely tell you that I would not sit through this experience again, however.4 out of 10",Eragon
47,charchuk,Unwatchable,2,4 March 2007,"I should have known better watching this movie, as I found the book poorly written and incredibly derivative. Still, it was readable, so I had small hopes that the film would at least be watchable. It wasn't. Terribly acted (with four Oscar nominees in the cast, that's no small feat!) and horribly edited, with bad effects and even worse writing than the book. Only Jeremy Irons seemed to be giving a damn, but the character is so poorly written that he can't do anything with it. The dragon looks incredibly fake, and the story is nothing more than an out-and-out rip-off of Star Wars - but that's the author's fault, and I knew that going in. Still, the story is cut down so much that all that remains is the basic SW plot, and it doesn't even try to hide it. There's no flow between scenes, no character development, and only brief bits of action, which are (admittedly) good. What a complete disaster.",Eragon
48,ttapola,The Chosen Legacy,5,24 January 2011,"Before the opening credits - which, surprisingly, this film so unlike most this millennium, has - were over, I felt the need to write a review. After all, I had heard about this film when it premiered and decided to not pay a single cent to see it. And now, thanks to the wonder of TV, the day has come and I must let out my thoughts.The pompous narration immediately set the alarm bells ringing. With it, the visually (at least for the moment) proficient movie slided impressively quickly into turkey land. Ideas stolen from elsewhere came almost faster than one could count. Dragon riders. As in ""of Pern"" by the McCaffreys, first published in 1967, from 1984 onwards also the central concept in the Dungeons & Dragons-based DragonLance saga.Then, had I not known what I was watching, came the title, also the name of the hero, ""Eragon"". Is that a misspelled anagram of Aragorn from The Lord of the Rings? And ""Beor Mountains""? Beorn from The Lord of the Rings, anyone? ""Galbatorix""? Is he a leftover from Asterix? He is absent for most of the movie, so we get his right-hand (or should that be left?) man Durza, who is a ""Shade"". Shade is also a type of monster in Dungeons & Dragons. Here it seems to be some kind of conjurer who can ignite fire and make the Ra'zac, foul beasts, rise from the ground. He also commands troops of cheap orc rip-offs: ugly, painted men who almost never speak.""Brom"", the mysterious old man, is also the name of the famous artist who's created art for, surprise surprise, Dungeons & Dragons, among other things. It would be almost funny that Brom the character is pretty much Aragorn in look and action-wise, were it not so embarrassing.The use of *the same* image of John Malcovich twice during the opening narration was unbelievably ill-judged. Soon after that the movie featured bad slowed-down footage - not that there even *can* be a good slowed down footage if the original is shot at 24 frames per second. There seems to have been other budget restraints also - it's handy that Sapphira the dragon is a telepath: saves a lot of money when there is no need to animate her mouth! ""Gil'ead""? As in Gilead from The Bible? Hey, if Stephen King used it in The Dark Tower series...The dialog was unbelievably clunky. The logic was baffling. Why does Sapphira mature in an instant? Why must Eragon also be a Harry Potter rip-off? Why is there a damsel in distress? Why is Jeremy Irons in this? Malkovich I understand - he seems to *enjoy* appearing in turkeys, hamming it always up so much it *must* be his wicked sense of humor directed towards the movie makers. Speaking about the movie makers, they must have studied the gorgeous wide shots in Peter Jackson's The Lord of the Rings - some have been almost directly copied into Eragon.One could go on, but what's the point? There is no originality and the lead character is about as engaging as a plank. The FX is decent, but the music is poor man's James Horn. The original book has not received critical acclaim, but surely the writers could at least have *tried* to improve on it? As a movie, this is just another mandatory job for pretty much everyone. It's not painful to watch - most viewers are likely to just be indifferent to it. Which is exactly what 5/10* represents. We can only be glad it flopped so we won't be subjected to any sequels.*) HOW THE RATING IS GIVEN: Since the average between the lowest rating (1) and highest rating (10) is 5.5, everything gets a starting rating of 6. After that, points are either added or subtracted depending on the actual content: Plot, script, acting, directing, music, production values and so on. Also, the content is weighted against previously rated works, which act as a guideline.

There's been a rule in Hollywood that any movie with a dragon will totally suck. That's sad since all of us want to see a GOOD DRAGON MOVIE. Well - this ain't that movie. The dragon riders of Pern is much better script/story for people that ride dragons, numerous dragons we have seen before are better than this one in looks and presentation. This dragon is female and doesn't have a real dragon's face in order to help kids identify with it as a character methinks.This is a dopey hollycrap movie with a target audience in mind, probably about the same as lion witch and the wardrobe target audience- which is what made that incredible tale show so pale on the screen. So for stupid kids that don't read and won't know any better- that's 96% of all kids- this movie will be fine to stick them with and they will give the rave review that it was OK.

50,nobbytatoes,not the fantasy one wants,4,17 December 2006,"Star Wars, for better or worse, started the genre of the Blockbuster. After it's success, money is thrown towards a film for which Studios hope huge profit returns; the money spinner. A part of the Blockbuster are the franchise films. While they've been around for some time, after success of comic book films Blade and X-Men, and more notedly the Harry Potter films, franchise films have become big money spinners.While many trilogies and sagas have been the response to the success of one film, a common practice lately of Studios' is the creation of a film franchise for a simple purpose of being a money spinner. Comics, books, games and television shows are pillaged and thrown at the cinema audience. While some of these films find directors and writers who commit to creating these films for the fans, being fans themselves; Sam Raimi on the Spider-Man films and Peter Jackson's complete dedication to the Lord of the Ring films, Harry Potter finds constant success with shifting directors and writers, create a film which connects to the followers of the original source. The draw back is when a myriad of people love and hold dear a book or comic, it's their bond to the source material a film maker is playing with too. Christopher Paolini has gather much accolades for his fantasy book Eragon and a strong fan base. With franchise films popping up everywhere, it doesn't come with much surprise that Eragon would receive the film treatment. Though does Eragon raise to fan expectation? With the book unread, comparison can be left behind, though not wholly needed. Without knowledge of the book, Eragon does not feel like a true adaptation to its source material. Screenwriter Peter Buchman has written a choppy and sporadic story and terrible dialog to boot. (When you see Jurrassic Park III is his only writing credit before this you may understand) Any screen adaptation of any book suffers from editing, Buchman seems to have edited too much out. Characters are undeveloped with many appear from nowhere, inconsistencies and plot holes are massive canyons only adding to its already erratic flow.As first time director, Stefen Fangmeier drags Eragon to a mediocre affair. Scenes are poorly shot, action scenes badly constructed, captured and over edited. Fangmeier starts off on the wrong foot with overly sappy and sentimental beginning, and a music score that screeches the entire time. Disappointingly Fangmeier doesn't give Eragon it's own distinctive nuance and visual aesthetic. It's easy to see Fangmeier is a fan of Lord of the Rings, Eragon just look like it; a lot looks like a cut and copy. Eragon doesn't stand by itself and unable to stand beside LOTR as a somewhat brother film, but instead an annoying cousin you wish would go away; similarly to Dungeons and Dragons.Jeremy Irons, John Malkovich and Robert Carlyle, three great actors slum it very low here. Jeremy Irons is so wasted as Brom, with a few gleaming moments of his talent. John Malkovich ramps up the camp value to extreme levels as King Galbatorix. Robert Carlyle misses that icy persona for Durza. New comer Edward Speleers may have looks and charm to pull him through, not the commanding presence to lead the film as Eragon. The best acting comes from the CGI dragon Saphira, voiced by Rachel Weisz.While this isn't a complete travesty, few capturing moments and the emotional strings pulled, but just when everything is slowing down and gaining focus, it's gone just when it's begun. Par those few moments, the special effects are the driving force behind Eragon. Even then they aren't awe inspiring nor much eye candy, with an over indulgence in set production and costume design.The inevitable closure hinting at a second coming of Eragon leaves one very doubtful, much has to be fixed from all the mistakes done in Eragon, if this franchise wants to stay alive. There might be a magical allure to the book, not much magic is happening here.",Eragon
51,tankace,I hate it,3,21 March 2016,"This so called Eragon doesn't deserve that name,this chip ripoff of Aragon, . It may make me a bit of a hipster but the book was way, way better than this awful ,boring, unexciting mess of a film. To my point that movie left out what made Eragon differ from Lord of the Rings and the director just try to make a copy paste of the Middle Earth. The fun thing is that the Fellowship had a budget of 93 million, 7 millions less and with technologically inferior CGI ,but if you go and compare them you are going to see that although five years older the computer effect on the Fellowship are pitch perfect and Eragon's look awfully fake. To be honest I hoped when I first went to see it that it would be a good film adaptation because I grew up with the inheritance cycle, I was disappointed and the fact that this film is at the bottom 10 according to Rotten Tomatoes and that the author Christofer Paolini disowned it, show by themselves how bad it was.

52,Cinema_Fan,A little too much of not enough.,1,26 December 2006,"This movie was exactly how I presumed it to be. My first point being the cast, Jeremy Irons and John Malkovich, what is going on here? Mr. Irons just has not the backbone to hold up a movie on his merit alone and with Mr. Malkovich seems to have gone down a level to adapt to this awful movie. If two leading men such as these were to be introduced, then one could hopefully wish that they would have something sufficient to say. Eragon has to have the most terrible, predicable and banal script of any movie I have seen for an age. This really is dialogue that any child could have written, except this credit goes to Peter Buchman, writer of Jurassic Park III (2001), this witless writing not only keeps the viewer in permanent comatose but goes against the grain of those more prominent to be saying them, very, very disappointing indeed if still very much obnoxious.This basic cinematography just holds its ground against its easily dismissed and dull dragon, Saphira and voiced by Rachel Weisz. Where this concept lets itself down too is the way it communicates with its boy rider, the use of telepathy, where this may work in the books, this seems nothing but a far too easy cop-out for any special effects team to attempt other wise.The intolerable story, so common with a certain sci-fi movie from 1977 when it concerns the introduction of the boy, his surroundings and his fourth coming adventure, is so painfully obvious too. Eragon is really doing itself no favours at all here, with at least three major conjunctures as cast, script and plot, if one should fall short then it may look as its weakest link but when all three are so poor then this catastrophe is simply, and literally, called Eragon.",Eragon
53,ozthegreatat42330,The Hell with the book. The movie stands on its own.,8,22 March 2007,"For a movie with a first time actor as the star it was very good. Maybe not Lord of the Rings good, but good none-the-less. I doubt that I will ever read the book, and it doesn't matter. I was entertained and found it a great joy. Of course it is obvious that it was left open for sequels, but that does not take away from the good performances by Jeremy Irons and John Malkavitch or Robert Carlysle. I would have liked to see the character of Brom continue on longer but one can't have everything. I am sorry but the mental defectives who all say this a bad or terrible film simply seem to be unable to judge a film on its own merits. I will enjoy seeing this one over and over. It is also enjoyable seeing Jeremy Irons in a good guy role after his role in ""Dungeons and Dragons."" I give it an 8 out of ten.",Eragon
54,PoisonKeyblade,An epic in the making,7,19 December 2006,"Christopher Paolini wrote Eragon when he was only fifteen, and it became a phenomenal success. While the film version of Eragon strays far from the book, cuts things out, and changes certain scenes, there is just no denying that it is an amazing film spectacle. With the fantasy craze that has been sweeping the nation with such films as Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire, Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest, Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe, and the Lord of the Rings trilogy, Eragon definitely stands out among the bunch, although some of them are equally great films. Eragon is directed by Stefen Fangmeier, and is based on the first book in the Inheritance trilogy by Paolini.Eragon (played by newcomer Edward Speleers) is a simple farm boy in the land of Alagaesia. One day, while hunting, Eragon comes upon a dragon egg and finds himself swept into a mystical journey on his quest to become a Dragon Rider. Brom (Jeremy Irons) becomes Eragon's mentor as the two of them, along with the newly born dragon Saphira, set out to dethrone the evil King Galbatorix (John Malkovich). The special effects are the most important part in any fantasy film, and Eragon definitely does not disappoint. The world is lush and beautiful, a pure delight to look at. The dragon, Saphira, is surely one of the best creatures ever created for a motion picture, and Rachel Weisz's voice-over fits perfectly. The acting in Eragon in also a surprise, with Edward Speleers leading the group in his very first feature film. Speleers has the entire movie resting upon his shoulders, and by his display of talent here, there is a long career ahead of him. Speleers' acting is arguably better than that of Daniel Radcliffe, who plays Harry Potter in the Harry Potter series. In supporting roles, John Malkovich is creepy as King Galbatorix, but nobody tops the frighteningly grotesque figure of Robert Carlyle as Durza. Garrett Hedlund shines as Murtagh, but is given very little screen time. Sienna Guillory plays Arya, but nothing major ever really happens with the character.Eragon is sure to be remembered for its great cast of characters and stunning world of fantasy. After all is said and done, the viewer is practically begging for the film adaption of the next in the Inheritance trilogy, Eldest.",Eragon
55,Quicksand,"Simplistic, Trivial and Insulting. Eight-Year-Olds Will Love It.",7,16 December 2006,"In 1997, I saw a film called ""Spawn,"" directed by Mark A.Z. Dippe'. The source material-- the comic, action figures, whatever-- were incredibly popular at the time, so I thought it odd that someone from the visual effects department, with no directing experience at all, would be chosen to direct a feature film. Though the special effects of the finished product were certainly striking for their time, the overall movie was beyond disappointing, and even with the fan excitement, ""Spawn"" tanked, there were no sequels, and the ""director"" never worked seriously again.In 2006, I saw a film called ""Eragon."" If you've looked up the director on the IMDb, you can see where I'm going with this. We've known the name of the director here for nearly a year, and over the months I managed to talk myself into it. ""It's a December release,"" I'd tell myself. ""Surely, Mr. Fangmeier must have shown something TRULY exceptional not only to get this job, but for his film to be good enough to be released at this time of year."" Turns out my initial reaction was the correct one: He can't direct, he was a poor choice for such a popular title, and has killed the series before it began. Well done, producers. You're not the first producers to shoot yourself in the foot, and you won't be the last.""Eragon"" isn't unwatchably bad, as it has a rather hefty novel to back it up. The visual effects are quite nice, and one or two FX sequences actually thrill. But I demand more from a 100-minute movie, and like most technicians or designers before him, Fangmeier shows absolutely no skill directing his actors, whatsoever. Jeremy Irons, professional that he is, bails out every scene he's in (and what a good sport, after that ""Dungeons and Dragons"" debacle), and Robert Carlyle is just sort of there. Malkovich less so, and Rachel Weisz even less so than that. All we're left with is pretty teenagers who will next be seen on Season 9 of ""Charmed."" I didn't know what to expect here, as both Harry Potter and Lord of the Rings have appealed to both kids and adults. ""Eragon"" will appeal solely to kids, or maybe teenage girls or gay men. There is more sexual chemistry-- I kid you not-- between Eragon and his dark-haired teenage rescuer, than there is in the chaste interaction between he and the dull redhead (who has multiple death scenes, but then shows up 5 minutes later, still hanging around).Movies like this are why movies with dragons never get made. Rent Willow, rent Harry Potter, read a D&D book or Anne McCaffrey or any number of things. This is just marketing with the most generic teenagers, score, and dialogue (""Let's finish this!"") I've ever heard. I worked in a bookstore when the book was released, and it appealed to all kinds, ages 5 to 85. The movie will make a few dollars this week, and then instantly vanish from your memory, until someone references it 9 years from now in an IMDb review, and you think to yourself, ""Wow, I remember that movie. That sure sucked.""",Eragon

With the newest CHRONICLES OF NARNIA adaptation being boring, I don't understand how this could be possible.Myself being a Canadian, I wonder how this crap was green-lit. I saw this yesterday in the theater and fell asleep 3 times. I liked the book, but this was just uninteresting.Here are two things you should be advised of before seeing this movie:1. The movie is NOTHING like the book- It seemed to me as if somebody read 5 chapters of the book and went ""Hey, I have an idea- This book is pretty impressive so far, so if we made a movie, despite the fact I we only know a little of the book, we could make a million dollars!"" This movie barely follows the book's plot line.2. The acting and special effects are terrible- At a couple times, I had a stomach ache, and the kids would have one too.To the director who decided to make this: Stop this madness NOW! We I saw a couple people leaving the theater... and I'm not surprised.And so that's it for me trying to provide a spoiler-free review, And in fact, it's my first Plot-free review in a while.

57,Gunnar_Runar_Ingibjargarson,"Wonderful story, OK. movie!",5,22 June 2008,"While it owes much of its appeal and appearance to the Lord of the Rings trilogy, Eragon can stand on its own as an enjoyable fantasy for younger viewers. Faithfully adapted from the bestselling novel by teenage author Christopher Paolini, this boy-and-his-dragon tale offers clean, fast-paced family entertainment without compromising the darker qualities of Paolini's novel (the first in what is known as the ""Inheritance"" trilogy). The plot centers on 17-year-old peasant farm boy Eragon (played by appealing newcomer Ed Speleers) who discovers a mysterious blue object that turns out to be an egg that eventually hatches to reveal Saphira, a blue-scaled dragon that quickly grows to full-size. According to prophecy, Eragon is destined to be a dragon-rider like those who once protected a benevolent kingdom, thus reviving an ancient conflict against the army of King Galbatorix (John Malkovich), a former dragon rider who turned to evil, now in alliance with a! dark-magic ""Shade"" sorcerer named Durza (Robert Carlyle). While the movie serves up familiar fantasy elements and offers little if anything new to fans of the genre (or anyone who's read the books of Anne McCaffrey and Ursula K. Le Guin), it's visually impressive (especially the dragon scenes, with Rachel Weisz providing the telepathic ""voice"" of Saphira) and full of timeless wisdom, much of it delivered by Eragon's heroic mentor Brom (Jeremy Irons), himself a former dragon rider with memories of past battles and hope for Eragon's future. Add a fair warrior-maiden named Arya (Sienna Guillory) and you've got all the ingredients for a worthwhile (if not particularly original) fantasy that points directly to a sequel. Whether that's a good or a bad thing is up to individual viewers to decide.",Eragon
58,ExpendableMan,Sugar free fantasy,3,13 January 2007,"Fantasy cinema is a very, very difficult genre to get right. For every Conan The Barbarian, there's a Hawk the Slayer. For every Princess Bride, there's a Red Sonja. And cliché though it may be, for Lord of the Rings, there's now an Eragon, an epic story about a young farm boy who becomes a dragon rider and battles an evil King that while diverting, is little more than a shallow enterprise that fulfills considerably less than it promises. Even if the dragon is kinda cool.The story revolves around the titular teenager (Ed Speelers), who one day finds a bizarre looking blue stone in the forest while hunting. Shortly after, with soldiers searching the land, our lad finds himself the centre of a quest to save the world from the clutches of the evil king (John Malkovich) when the stone turns out to be an egg and he is given the unenviable task of becoming the latest in the illustrious line of now dead warriors known as the Jedi. Sorry, Dragon Riders. Cue chases through forest, over mountains and all sorts of New Zealand scenery that looks suitably dramatic when filmed from a helicopter as he hurtles headlong towards a final climactic battle.The chief problem Eragon has however is that much of the film feels like a collage of elements from other movies. Jeremy Irons for all his attempts cannot help but rip off Obi Wan Kenobi so much you half expect him to tell Eragon that the King betrayed and murdered his father at any second. Robert Carlyle meanwhile is obviously having an absolute blast camping it up as an evil sorcerer, but looks so much like Worm Tongue from The Two Towers that it's impossible to accept him as any more than a retread. Ally this to the formulaic plot and the dismissal of the film as 'Lord of the Cheese' seems all too accurate.Central to the cheese factor is lead actor Ed Speelers. To be fair to him, it's his first ever movie role and being cast as the centrepiece of a massively hyped blockbuster had to be incredibly daunting so I almost feel guilty to say that he just isn't very good. Eragon the character is just like Anakin Skywalker, it's very difficult to take a chosen warrior seriously when he acts like a stroppy teenager and considering his only experience of fighting is playing with sticks with his brother, his reckless enthusiasm for battling the King's hordes of axe flailing savages makes you doubt the logic behind making him General of an entire army. On a slightly minor but also incredibly irritating point, despite getting into fights, breaking into prisons and being involved in a massive mid air battle at the movie's climax that leaves him utterly drained, his hair looks perfect all the time.That little rant aside, the general impression you're most likely to have of Eragon is that it would have probably been a much better movie if they'd increased the running time a little. Eragon and Brom (the aforementioned Jeremy Irons) are both afforded plenty of characterisation as does Saphira, the Dragon who sounds like Rachel Weiz, but everyone else is merely there to fill in the blanks. Sienna Guillory is only there to provide Eragon with somebody to rescue and given that they hardly speak, their tearful farewell at the end seems completely forced. Garret Hedlund's Murtagh meanwhile has the potential to be one of the most interesting characters given his back-story, but instead is used only as a mysterious warrior who can get Eragon out of a few tight situations. Djimon Hounsou is similarly wasted, the normally reliable actor turning up at the end dressed in a very silly outfit then doing next to nothing except shout orders.Admittedly, it's not all bad. Rachel Weiz remains as bubbly and lovable as ever despite only doing voice work and there is a bit of fun to be had thanks to the high level of camp. Furthermore, the one major battle scene is also very enjoyable even if it is a bit short and should anyone out there be wondering what would happen if the Taliban came to blows with the Uruk Hai they need look no further. And without meaning to give too much away, the cliff hanger ending is really very good, even if you do see it coming a mile away.This isn't enough to raise Eragon's level anywhere above the category of Must Try Harder sadly. It rips off too much from other movies and is far too contrived to stand on its own toes. If Lord of the Rings was a three course banquet, Eragon is a single course taken from a fast food restaurant's kids menu. Hopefully it'll pick up steam by the time the sequel surfaces.",Eragon
59,Thrashman88,"Derivative, but fun to watch!",8,6 January 2007,"ERAGON might be like ""Science Fiction & Fantasy Films Greatest Hits"", since the movie is derivative of some of the genre's greatest films: STAR WARS, LORD OF THE RINGS, etc. But this DOESN'T mean the movie is BAD or worthless. I actually read some VERY bad reviews about ERAGON before going to the movie theater and I must confess that those reviews made me very cautious, but in the end I'd be lying if I say that I didn't enjoy ERAGON. ERAGON tells the tale of a young boy who was born to become a dragon rider, a now defunct league of servants and protectors of the land. You immediately think of the Jedi order or something like the Terakian's (from the HEAVY METAL animated movie)in that both races are extinct and only one warrior survives. The nice twist here was the dragon; instead of portraying the dragon as the typical menacing, fire-breathing beast, we have Saphira (voices by Rachel Weisz), a soft spoken dragon who chooses Eragon as her rider and together they band to overthrow the tyranny of John Malkovich's character. If this sounds familiar it's because it probably is, but this doesn't mean they movie is a bore fest. ERAGON moves surprisingly fast, thanks to the clever editing. I think the director went for a more ""gung-ho"" style of picture that a more subtle kind, like LORD OF THE RINGS, where you watch every character to nauseating detail. The effects and battles are good and get the job done, although it's nothing new. The violence is more implied and although you get the impression that the battles are bloody and violent, they are not. Again, the clever editing gives off the impression that you're watching gory battles. This is, after all, a PG rated movie. If people complain about derivative films, then there wouldn't be MISSION IMPOSSIBLES, INDIANA JONES, MATRIX part &&&, etc., and you shouldn't bother watching these movies. True, not all of this films are particularly groundbreaking, but they are fun to watch and leave you pretty satisfied. 20th Century Fox obviously plans to make a saga out of ERAGON and we'll just have to hope that the next movies based on this one are better. For the moment (and for my money) ERAGON is a fun movie that makes for an entertaining 2 hours.",Eragon
60,the amorphousmachine,"Yep, a 5.0 is pretty accurate.",5,8 April 2008,"I feel so silly, but upon reading the other reviews, the viewer can see connections between this film and 'Star Wars: A New Hope'- particularly considering this film suggests there is still more to come. Regardless, without spotting (or thinking) about the connection to a saga in a galaxy far far away, my initial thought of this movie was that it was banking on the success of the Lord of the Rings films.What saves 'Eragon' from being a complete mess is some of the visual effects and bringing the dragon, Saphira (voiced by Rachel Weisz), to life. Some of the cinematography is fantastic, as well as the use of certain locations, and the overall costume design is pretty decent too. However, the editing and direction seemed a little unbalanced- with some scenes lacking conviction. The dragon fight at the end was reasonable enough, but the whole battle didn't feel staged right. The bad guys sucked in this film, and John Malkovich as Galbatorix didn't seem eminent enough. His scenes were badly shot and directed. In fact, the main nemesis for this film is Dorza (Robert Carlyle) who is a powerful ""shade""/sorceror. Carlyle's Begbie was ten-times scarier than his Dorza. Jeremy Irons walks through his role, and Ed Speleers as the title character tries very hard, but seems out of his league. However, Speleers was decent enough and likable hero. It's the direction, script, and dialogue that was very questionable to me.To cut a long story short, if you were always a little curious about 'Eragon'- it will probably match your expectations.

Neither did it blow many people away the way the other previously-mentioned fantasy films were able to do.'Eragon' falls way short of coming to that standard, due to the overall writing of the movie: major plot holes, a rushed story, and an overall feeling that the story had been clipped down so much from the novel that it was crippled.Neither could a feeling escape me as I watched the movie to compare it to the story of the first 'Star Wars.' The story really is the same: young farmboy lives with his uncle, discovers magic beyond his wildest dreams, and sets out in his world for bigger things. His uncle dies after encounting characters beyond his farm, and the main character finds a wizard who knows the greater magic as they join together to save the princess.The plot really is the exact same, set in different worlds. No wonder the character of Eragon could not escape my comparisons to Luke Skywalker, as they were essentially the same character.However, the direction and production of this film doesn't come close to the space fantasy classic, nor does it compare to other less-inspired films. While the special effects are superb (they definitely got the financing for this movie... the studio was banking on a success at the level of 'Rings' or 'Narnia' or 'Harry,') the acting is wooden- Ed Speelers did not impress at all- and, as previously stated, the storyline seemed cut short of what it could have been.

If you want to understand, you clearly need to read the book, but everyone who has read the book says the movie is so awful compared to that.

Dragons are awesome. The fact that it's an adaptation of a book series brings further attention to itself from audiences. Why doesn't the movie work all the way? Let's find out.Long ago, peace was maintained by the legendary dragon riders until they were all betrayed and mostly slain by a rogue dragon rider turned king (John Malkovich), who now rules through fear. A teenage boy named Eragon finds a blue egg which hatches into the female dragon Saphira, who develops a mystical bond with him. Guided by a mysterious stranger Brom (Jeremy Irons), Eragon and Saphira set out to strike down evil with their combined magical might.To be fair, there's quite a bit to like about this film. Special effects are nice and detailed, creatures like Saphira are great, story is decent, and the action scenes are fun, particularly the final fight. Jeremy Irons and John Malkovich pretty much steal the show, delivering good performances.The rest is pretty crappy. The rest of the actors are terrible, especially the guy playing Eragon who is miscast.

It's the name of the hero; and, while his companions are not named Frotto and Gondoff, the echo gives some slight idea of the story's...debt to others, might one say?This Aragor--er, Eragon--has fallen into possession of a magical object stolen from an evil ruler who dispatches his minions to get it back.... Uh, yeah, been there, done that. The object in this instance is a jewel in the shape of a watermelon, which turns out to be no jewel at all but a dragon's egg, lawd, lawd. Then the dragon hatches and names Eragon its rider.... Hmm, sounds like somebody's been reading Tolkien and McCaffrey under the covers at night. The movie looks like Lord of the Rings--lots of woods and mountains--intercut with Xena: Warrior Princess--lots of peasants (who are cheap to costume) living in huts (which are cheap to build). The script is patchy; to wit: As accompaniment to a show of scenic vistas (more leftovers from LOTR) an announcer unfolds a back story that makes not much sense. Cut to: A forest. A rider. More riders. The announcer explains that a character we don't know has stolen an object we can't see, by means we're not shown, from bad king Getafix, who acquired it in a manner we're not told, for a purpose we don't learn. Cut to: Another forest. Our hero is going hunting. The announcer explains that he's our hero and that he's going hunting, and from now on Sundays will never be the same. Having barely met him, we now meet his brother, who so resembles him they can hardly be told apart; but to our benefit, the brother--having done nothing in the story -- exits it immediately, in three scenes so brief they could have been combined into one. Being familiar with this kind of story, I knew he'd be sure to reappear later, to save his brother from certain death in the nick of time. But nope, that's the last we see of him; so there was no need for him to appear in the story at all. Whereas, on the other hand, the one character the story could use--the only interesting one--is dispatched ruthlessly. Presently the hero embarks on his quest: to find where a rebel army is quartered. It's not much of a quest, but it's still a quest; and of course one knows what these consist of: visits to fantastic places; encounters with fantastic creatures; the braving of fantastic perils! Only, our hero misses out on all that; has just a couple of skirmishes with the bad king's minions, and mainly his chief minion, performed by Robert Carlyle, whose performance...well, I can only suppose that, being a Scotsman, he remembered the band Silly Wizard and taken its name as his cue. Only Jeremy Irons, as the Aragorn replicate, is able to hold his own in the face of pompous staging, choppy editing, and arrhythmic scoring. This is the third movie in a row I've seen where the music often doesn't fit, as if the soundtrack CD had been overlaid like wallpaper over pictures already hung.

I mean, I could never consider it being a 'bad' fantasy movie, it entertains and is perfectly watchable.",5,15 December 2006,"Okay, I've never read the novel. Just got to see it, and I'm surprised to see how many people hated this movie (all the under 5 scores I mean). I thought this movie had way too much bashing on it. The special effects alone would score this movie pretty high. I mean, how can you not be impressed with the female dragon Saphira? Sure, the lead actor who plays Eragon isn't a big star but he wasn't bad and did pretty well. I thought the biggest problem with this movie was that it was way too short! I was expecting a lot more, but I knew from the start it was going to be no Lord Of The Rings. It was, at least what I would consider ""reasonable"" and what I was at least ""expecting"".Eragon follows a poor boy named Eragon, who discovers a dragon egg, which then hatches (the dragon's name is Saphira) and it tells him he is the next dragon rider and he's the one who can stop the king and give peace to the land. Eragon has a few other followers with him as well, plus he gets some moves and magic skills. Typical fantasy stuff.So, even if the movie wasn't totally original (I admit, it wasn't but I got over it) it entertained, or impressed me in some way or the other. Just get over the fact that it's not going to be one of the best fantasy movies ever. It's a good movie. Nothing more, nothing less.

68,Come-and-Review,Reboot it! Not just because it's different than the book...,4,27 September 2015,"... It's because it's awfully dumbed down. Let me explain it: If you check my review for ""the eagle"", which was different than the book for many aspects, you'll find a generally positive review. Why? Because still being different from the book, it was notable as a film and the changes done didn't simplify the original story, more likely complicated it. Here we assist at what seems to be a premature transposition to the films of a book. I can say that because...1) Casting choices not only it seems that the casting process wasn't affected by the characters as depicted in the book, but also in terms of movie casting I would've never thought of giving John Malkovich Galbatorix's role. Even though it has a limited appearance in this film, it's an example of the strange casting choices.2) Visual effects Saphira, the dragon, is definitely well depicted. Truly some great effects. But... it appears that the studio couldn't afford to get additional visual effects. Usually people praise the use of practical effects that escalate the CG effects, but in this movie characters like the urgals just couldn't be brought to life with some prostetics. Also, while natural locations used in the movie are quite beautiful, there are tons of landscapes that would've been visually stunning, that might have required some CG to be shown properly, and that might needed tech that came out later, and weren't even depicted. We'll come back to this later.3) Buying the rights to a book that you'll ignore Exactly. It's like when they bought the story named ""Blade runner"" just to use it for the movie of the same name, that is inspired by a different book. Just, in this case, they considered it a transposition of the same book. I won't be saying in how many places this movie's story differs from the original, but I'll tell that major details that have been changed make a sequel to this movie unlikely to happen.And this is the principal issue of the film: that it was prematurely filmed. At the time, the series wasn't even finished. Because of that I think they should've waited before shooting, at least to see how would it turn out. Most of the mistakes this movie has done come from the fact that it was done too early, and with a too low budget. Because all of the things that would actually make a movie based off eragon great are visual technologies that came out after Avatar, and are also expensive. Also this series would require the direction of a famous director, with a great cast. Not that all the casting choices were bad. Durza and Murthagh's actors standed by their roles.Oh, also- dwarfs are supposed to be short. You can't deny that in a film.",Eragon

There was nothing bad about it, except that it became uninteresting and mediocre at times. I loved the dragon, for she was of course a lovable character anyway, and even though the main characters did not stand out as much as they should have, they did a good job at building their personalities. It was not a terrible movie, but I really do not think it is anywhere near worthy of a 10 either, so if you want a good time, give this film a try, but if you are looking for an Oscar worthy movie, stay away from Eragon.",Eragon
70,saarvardi,Digital dragons never looked better!,7,11 December 2006,"I have to say I was pleasantly surprised by Eragon upon watching it during a special press screening in Ramat Gan, Israel on Sunday, December 10th. After Narnia and Lord of the Rings, it had big shoes to fill and many potentially great fantasy adaptations were (and still are) riding on it's back. If Eragon the movie fails to live up to the aforementioned films' success, the future of fantasy cinema is in question; if the box office receipts are satisfying, the sky is the limit for films of the genre. My two cents - I think the film delivers on mostly all scales and justifies the investment.Everything in Eragon is top notch - starting from the breathtaking scenery and special effects, and unto the (surprisingly good) acting. 19 year-old Edward Speelers actually manages to carry most of the film on his back, despite being rather young and totally anonymous. He has this unique sincerity in his acting I haven't seen in a young actor for a very lone time. Of course, the presence of Jeremy Irons as his aspiring mentor (didn't he play the exact same thing in Kingdom of Heaven?) helps him push through during the first half of the film. John Malcovich's menacing voice as the tormented yet evil King Galbatorix actually managed to send shivers down my spine (kudos, Mr. Malcovich), and the only famous talented I found somewhat disappointing was Rachel Wiesz's take on the dragoness Saphira.The plot tells of a faraway Dungeons and Dragons' like land where legends of dragon riders fighting for peace inspire the weak and weary people. They have been long ruled by King Galbatorix and his devilish army of ghouls and evil sorcerers. But not for long. A young farmer named Eragon finds an intriguing egg while hunting. Soon a tiny dragon hatches (one of the cutest CGI moments you'll ever see on film - I promise) and Eragon is chosen to be it's rider. From here on out Eragon sets on a quest to gather the remaining forces of resistance who oppose King Galbatorix, and save the people, with the help of mentor Brom (Jeremy Irons), Saphira - the last existing dragoness, Arya (Sienna Guillory, ""Love Actually"") and more.Yes, this is your basic (and much clichéd) coming of age story through which a young man must fight to find his way in life, and save the world whilst doing so. You've seen it in some version or another in films like Star Wars IV: A New Hope, the Harry Potter films and others, but if done right - it's always refreshing to see the story told again, from a new and different perspective. Here, you get to see that, along with awesome fight sequences, thrilling special effects and that good old epic feel you get towards the end, as you know you are now part of a new and magical journey. For me, it was a chance to feel like a child again, forget the time and life's other worries, and eat a can of popcorn with my girlfriend as if we were teenagers on our first date. Bottom line - Eragon is an excellent addition to the growing world of fantasy films. I gave it an 8 out of 10.",Eragon
71,skoyles,A Test of Heart,9,8 January 2008,"A couple of generations ago the Brits created a sword and sorcery romp called ""Krull"". I may have been one of two people on earth who liked it. ""Eragon"" may be this generation's much better version. I had no idea whether ""Eragon"" was based on a novel, a game or was original. I really do not care. This is a movie that is almost but not quite predictable, grabs one's emotions immediately and never lets go. Let me modify that: it grabs one if one is not a jaded cynic who has forgotten the wonder of dragons, flight, swords, magic and the panoply of growing up. It is another ""coming of age"" tale but not of the ""Eurotrip"" variety but of the classics, of the sagas, of that corner of many hearts that is forever honorable, courageous and wide-eyed with wonder at the marvel of existence. It is a twelve year olds' dream and an old man's memory of how things should have been. It is romance, beauty and valour. If only one can touch for the tiniest moment the innocence that we all lose far too soon, ""Eragon"" becomes a joy.",Eragon
72,TheMovieDoctorful,The Adaptation That The Noxious Book Deserves,2,12 November 2018,"The Eragon books have aged like a bowl of cottage cheese sitting in the Gobi Desert for 18 months. While I hailed the books as brilliant, well written masterpieces in my youth, adulthood has made me a lot more aware of their blatant problems with characterization, dialogue, prose, character development, romance, sexism and plagiarism. While my awareness to the awfulness of the books is fairly recent, I knew Eragon was a bad movie from the first time I saw it as a 9 year old in theaters. In fact, Eragon holds the distinction of being the first movie I ever recognized as being bad. So it goes without saying that, as awful as the books are, the movie somehow manages to be even worse. How is that even possible?If you really want me to nitpick, there are a couple things I enjoy here. Jeremy Irons is outstanding as Brom, the former Dragon Rider turned village-storyteller who trains Eragon in the ways of his ancient order. He showcases some incredible range here, from the exhaustion and hopelessness caused by the decades past extinction of his entire religion to the enthusiasm, pride and excited hopefulness he gives upon seeing Eragon's skills thrive as a Dragon Rider. You can really tell watching him that he takes his role seriously and is desperately trying to raise the professionalism and credibility of this otherwise-miserable failure. He gives as much depth as possible to a role really devoid of any. Minus Irons, the film can also be unintentionally hilarious at times.Also, I do have to point out that I absolutely love the credits song Holding On by Avril Lavigne. It fits the movie this is at least trying to be and I just generally love all things Avril. I don't know, maybe I'm just a 2000s Instagram teenage girl at heart.John Malkovich gets very little screentime, but plays the role of King Galbatorix like the villain of a Highlander sequel. The film becomes 10x more enjoyable whenever he's on scream. Robert Carlyle is a laugh riot as well as the Shade Durza. There's literally a scene where, for no particular reason at all, he full on hisses to show the audience how evil he is (A scene that's admittedly taken straight from the atrocious book it's based on.) You may think from my description that these performances were intentional camp, but I assure you. I sat through this thing and it's entirely aiming to be taken seriously as High Fantasy. Just try listening to it's hilariously bombastic, over-the-top, overblown and pompous musical score. The sheer ambition of the film, the idea that this crew of clowns thought this was the film that was gonna take down Lord of the Rings or Harry Potter is hilarious beyond words.Edward Speelers isn't a ""bad actor"" persay, but my God is he a boring one here. He brings nothing to the role of Eragon, which is a big problem when the character is already weakly characterized and thinly written. He doesn't have the enthusiastic optimism of Mark Hamill's Luke, the rougeish charm of Justin Whalin's Ridley, the boyish innocence of Elijah Wood's Frodo or the tortured angst of Hayden Christensen's Anakin. The performance and the character offer nothing to grip or invest us, nothing of substance. It's the same ""farm boy discovers he's the Chosen One"" cliche we've seen a million times before. At least the movie ignored the book's characterization of Eragon being a creepy, possessive, ""nice guy"" incel to Arya (Can you tell it was written by a 15 year old boy?)Speaking of Arya, my God, what a shallow, poorly written throwaway character. In both the book and the movie, she's a ""strong, empowered character"" in the most 2006 way possible. She's highly intelligent, when she's not getting herself captured. She's a badass who can take care of herself, despite spending more than half the movie being tortured and needing a man to save her. She's a strong and authoritative leader, despite having her authority usurped by like 3 other characters.The system of magic and spell casting was one of the only interesting, unique and imaginative ideas in the entire Eragon mythos. And, somehow, the movie even manages to screw that up. Rather than a mysterious, wild, almost living entity of nature of the book that sought to destroy those who attempted to use it and weren't worthy, magic in the Eragon movie is merely an extreme power that needs extra restraint to be controlled. Do you understand what I mean now when I say the movie is worse?The characterization is all over the place in this film. Characters will get introduced left and right, built up with important positions and backstories and never developed or expanded upon at all. There's talk of Dwarven kings and Rebel leaders and children of traitors, but no actual characters to be seen here. They're only included to have bigger roles in the (hypothetical) sequels, but if there's nothing in Eragon to justify its existence as its own story, why would we want to come back for more?The production value is absolutely embarrassing considering the massive budget and the film's ambitions for a franchise. The cinematography is lazy and lifeless, the sets are overstuffed and lack personality, the costume and weapon design look like cheap Game of Thrones cosplay, the CGI is cartoonish and uninventive, the creature FX makeup is unimaginative and boring. This is an ugly, ugly world. Isn't the point of high fantasy to transport us to a world more wondrous and spectacular than our own? Eragon's production values and aesthetics feel straight out of a CW show.Eragon represents the worst of fantasy fiction. It has no identity, no substance and no soul beyond copying what both Paolini and the filmmakers thought were ""cool"" aspects of Lord of the Rings. And it was written by the same idiot who did Jurassic Park III. Why am I not surprised?",Eragon
73,RCWjr,"Adequate entertainment, but nothing more than that",6,6 March 2007,"This is a paint by the numbers adventure. I guess considering I have never read the book, I am not as inclined to be harder on this film. From what I understand, it differs from the book greatly.All in all, the cast do a more than adequate job here. Malcovich continues to take these roles where he says every line through seething, gritting teeth. The guy can act, but you wouldn't know it from these kinds of roles. Thank goodness he is not in the film much.Jeremy Irons is, as usual, above the material he has and makes it seem better than it really is. Speleers as the young Eragon is quite good, though limited by what he has to work with.Overall the effects are good, a notch up from previous dragon films. I just couldn't get over the fact that the whole story had already been told a time or two......or three in other films before (Star Wars being the most referenced). I don't know if the book comes off that way, but I would imagine with the fervent readership it has to be much more original than the film would lead you to believe.Not the most original tale, but none the less, a harmless film that you would not be wasting your time to see, but not a film which would make you believe the book is anything special.",Eragon
74,AZINDN,Dragon Flights of Fantasy,7,21 December 2007,"Eragon (Ed Speleers) is a young farmer who discovers an egg one day. When the egg hatches, out pops a baby dragon who the human learns is his dragon, and that he is a Dragon Rider. Through the inevitable growing pains of child to youth, youth to adult, young Eragon is mentored by a former dragon rider, Jeremy Irons, and learns that dragons and their human rider are bound together by a shared destiny until death. How they choose to live this partnership is the gist of the story as Eragon seeks to save his country from an evil ruler and magician with the help of a band of rebel outcasts, a magic sword, and the brave dragon. Of course, a young beautiful girl, Sienna Guillory is the first love of Eragon, and the partnership of Safira, the dragon and her rider becomes a life's test of courage, cunning, and growing wisdom.This is a light fantasy film that is most of all feel-good with a smattering of ""ancient"" wisdom and swordplay which will entertain younger audiences. The special effects and overall look of the film is passable, not a multi-million dollar SFX laden film, but believable in its visuals. As for the story, I don't read fictional fantasy so I had no basis for comparison with ""the book."" But, I'm not a fan of comparing text to visuals as criterion for quality or authenticity for each medium is its own separate art form. This is a family film that will entertain and enthrall youngsters as well as possibly impart some sense of honor, wisdom through purpose, and a sense of duty above self -- all characteristics that are missing in the mindless, fart-heavy humor of most ""tweeny"" movies put out for commercial distribution today.If only to watch the stellar performance of the excellent British actor, Jeremy Irons as he mentors the wet-behind-the-ears Dragon Rider, the film is worth watching as the really ugly bad guys try to bring down the last of the dragons and her headstrong partner.",Eragon
75,barbagvido,I'm gonna throw up,2,1 September 2015,"Alright, this was horrible. And it could've been so awesome! It's rushed, it's cheesy, it's way too short, Saphira had feathers (what was the writer smoking?) and don't get me started on the Urgals and Raz'acs! There are 3 good things about this movie and they are the reason I decided to give it a 2:baby Saphira (so cute!), effects and actors. Oh yeah, and Murtagh. That's four. I didn't mind Speleers as Eragon. He did look different but his acting was okay. Same with Irons. But I thought Hedlund was a great Murtagh. There wasn't really much of him because the movie had to be so rushed! The book wasn't really praised but it still got my attention and when I read it, I loved it. I heard the movie is terrible but I'm really tolerable about changes and judging by the trailers, it looked pretty good. If I liked Percy Jackson and Beautiful Creatures no matter how much they changed, I thought I'll like this too. But no, this is more like a parody than an adaptation. I know the book has so much plot and can't easily fit into one movie even if it was an hour longer so I really, really hope they make a TV show based on this and stay true to the book series. And each season to be one book so I can forget this terrible movie and pretend it never happened.",Eragon

77,fearfulofspiders,Dreadful...,3,1 September 2008,"Seeing this film as plagiarism of varying degrees, I have little, if anything, good to say about this production. Christopher Paolini should be ashamed of himself for what he calls originality, is actually thievery of Star Wars - Episode IV- A New Hope. From the dragon-riders (Jedi) to magic (the Force) to the ever-continuing subplot of betrayal and battles for supremacy.Starting with the acting, this is one wooden movie. Edward Speelers is pretty terrible as the title hero, and Jeremy Irons is trying his hardest to be the next Kenobi or Gandalf. John Malkovich's performances made me think less of the actor, in fact, I have lost a lot of respect because of his most recent performances. To sum it up, Djimon Hounsou is probably the worst of the bunch.The special effects are the best part of the film. While still interweaving with the plagiarism, Saphira is very good looking, though the battles are boring and carbon-copies, the CGI is well done.The writing, as aforementioned, is complete theft of the storyline and elements of Star Wars - Episode IV - A New Hope. Paolini was simply to young when he wrote these, as he thought stealing these points would make him seem original, instead of studying myths and legends. There is absolutely nothing here that is n-e-w. Paolini should see a lawsuit any day now, I hope.Patrick Doyle's score is cliché, with hardly any sweep or complexity. Definitely avoid it at all costs.All in all, Eragon is one disappointment after the other. From lack of originality to just poor execution, this film is a failure. I highly recommend everyone to skip this mediocre production.",Eragon

You see, I found Djimon Hounsou, Jeremy Irons and Edward Speleers interesting. But I found Sienna Guillory a bit unconvincing at the beginning, still, her performance was incredible for the rest of the movie. I have found many coincidences on star wars and that movie: Brom is an Obi-Wan, Eragon is an Anakin Skywalker, Dragons replace spaceships. And many more! But find them by yourself. I really liked the battle sequences, though many people found them unrealistic. I thought they warmed up the movie a little. Anyways, this movie was great and I recommend it.

I don't recommend seriously to anybody but in the sense of laughter and jokes Eragon is like a carnival.The story of ""Eragon"" has been written by young Chistopher Paolini. He was only 15 year-old when he began to write ""Eragon"" and was about 20 year-old when the book was published. And it shows. He has been greatly influenced from J.R.R Tolkien's production to the comic adventures of Asterix and Obelix. All the names of the character's reminds of them, like Galbatorix, Eragon and some of the names of the places in the film. But also the screenplay's maker made a very flat script. The movie stand's still. There isn't any extraordinary in ""Eragon"".There is a few brilliant actors in ""Eragon"" and the reason big names like John Malkovich and Jeremy Irons have said yes to the movie is of course the color of money. That is understandable but if I was as a big star than Malkovich I wouldn't except the role whose name is Galbatorix. And if the script is so insignificant.It wonders me why in the name of a good movie they don't seem to find better younger actors? Keyroles's Ed Speeler is still so green fruit that you want start to cry. The ending of the movie indicates that there is a sequel coming. So we will be seeing (most certainly) same kind of fantasy like ""ragon"". Paolini has also written a novel called ""Eldest"" in which Eragon's story continues...It is a shame that the only sympathetic character dies in the movie... Maybe he will return somehow to the sequel. But I am afraid that I don't want watch the next part.",Eragon
82,brettchatz-1,Fantasy at its best!,7,15 December 2006,"Film Review: Eragon Cast: John Malkovich; Jeremy Irons; Edward Speleers and Sienna Guillory Eragon tells the tale of Dragon Riders  the protectors of society.In a faraway land, in medieval times, an evil King rules the roost with an iron-fist. Aided by his horrid sorcerer, the King wreaks havoc in his fiefdom. Blatant theft, punitive taxation and the draft are some of the hateful practices people have to endure.But, it was not always so.The sanctity of the Kingdom was previously safeguarded by a noble group of law-abiding Dragon Riders. For many years these Riders protected the people from wrongdoing. Eventually however, one such Dragon Rider desired all the power for himself. He set out on a mission to rid the Kingdom of all its protectors. The solitary remaining Dragon belonged to none other than the evil King himself.The resistance movement went into hiding, fearing for their lives.Many years later one Dragon egg is stolen from the Royal Palace. The King's beastly henchmen are sent on a mission to find the guardian of the hatchling and kill him. So begins a tale of epic proportions; with Eragon as the last Dragon Rider.The film is a marvel to behold. It is simply fantastic. The visual effects are spellbinding and the action is relentless. Jeremy Irons is superbly cast as a fallen Rider who guides the impressionable Eragon in his journey towards righteousness and wisdom.If fantasy and adventure are your forte, then Eragon is the Holiday film to be seen!",Eragon
83,the-gossip-king,Rubbish!,1,26 October 2007,"This movie is nothing more than a disappointment. Unfortunately it has to be put flatly. The only good actors in the entire movie were Jeremy Irons who was very well cast as Brom and John Malcovich as Galbatorix (if the movie was faithful in the slightest to the book he shouldn't have even had a part.) However, that is no excuse because they are both just two fine actors. The actress of the female heroine Arya was rubbish. She gave the character in the movie a completely different personality to the one in the book. Edward Speelers I couldn't say was terrible because it is his first movie but he had no presence in the film. The visuals were good but that DOES NOT MAKE A MOVIE. The only other good thing was the voice of Saphira the dragon. Otherwise definitely not worth seeing unless it is free! Not worth anyone's money.",Eragon

One more movie scorning a brilliant piece of literature and one more movie to halt a great future movie. Which movie? The one this could have been had it had a script writer who could actually read and a director who hasn't lost his eyesight in some freak accident involving glue and a plastic bag. In other words: It will take considerable time before someone who can actually make movies are allowed to do it right, because it has already been done. Sheez! If it doesn't show already, the books are absolutely brilliant! They shine in a world of below par fantasy literature and should be in every fantasy loving person's book shelf alongside Lord of The Rings and Pullman's Darker Materials. The latter being another example of literary rape by inadequate and money hungry movie producers. There should be a clause in the copyright laws stating that if a movie turns out bad, it should be legal for others to disregard all copyright issues and remake it and do it properly.Why this movie is extraordinarily bad has already been commented on in every possible way.

So, first the plot: it is exactly the same as every other fantasy film ever. The cast, then: Jeremy Irons did a professional job, John Malkovich looked bored stiff, Robert Carlyle looked like he was worried his mates might see him and Balsa Wood, as Eragon, had all the panache, charm and emotion of, ooh, a small piece of wood. That's been painted grey. The effects then: well, they were alright, I guess. The dragon looked pretty most of the time although the voice really didn't gel, and everyone made a reasonable fist of things and if, like me, you find yourself stuck with absolutely nothing else to do on a rainy weekday afternoon you could do worse than watch this (you could, for example, poke yourself in the eye).

87,crowrobot,A decent book becomes a wretched movie...,2,8 April 2007,"I would be the first to tell you that Christopher Paolini's 'Eragon' and its sequel 'Eldest' are by no means Shakespearean (the third book, 'Empire', comes out later this year). Sure, Paolini ripped off Tolkien, Star Wars, and Anne McCaffrey's Dragon Riders, but he managed to make two interesting and enjoyable fantasy novels out of this hodgepodge. The movie version of 'Eragon', however, is simply a mess.The first of many problems with the movie is pacing. 'Eragon' is a fairly good-sized book, and the decision to cut the lengthy narrative down into an 100-minute film is mind-boggling. The script barrels from one scene to the next with no regard for pace or coherence. Director Stefen Fangmeier, a former visual effects supervisor, does a decent job with the action scenes, but he has no idea how to direct scenes that don't involve special effects.Just about everyone in the movie is miscast. From Ed Speelers' ultra-bland performance as the title character, to John Malkovich's utterly bored King Galbatorix (Malkovich gives the impression that he was on the set for about an hour), and Sienna Guillory's ear-splitting ""performance"" as elf chick Arya, almost every actor is utterly wretched. There are two bright spots amongst the actors: Jeremy Irons, who gives the movie's best performance as Eragon's mentor Brom; he's slumming, granted, but Irons is an entertaining actor even at his lowest points. Another bright spot is Robert Carlyle, who, while not exactly good, at least puts some effort into his villainous role as Durza the Shade.Next to Irons and Carlyle, the best aspect of the movie is Eragon's dragon Saphira (well-voiced by Rachel Weisz). Beautifully realized by Industrial Light and Magic, the film takes off only when Saphira comes on the scene.While Paolini's books are entertaining Tolkien-McCaffrey ripoffs, 'Eragon' is simply dreadful.",Eragon

The movie was so damn formulaic -- hero gets his family wasted, hero wants revenge, hero gets it, everyone lives happily ever after, bla bla bla.IF there is a sequel to this movie, I sure as hell hope they bring in a half-decent director and lead.

However swing in 2010 i've bought it for cheap so I gave it a go. First thing that hit me is its very cliché' and there is nothing are shocked about seeing. You can see it coming half way through the film, who's gonna die, who's gonna save the day, who's gonna live. This is a very contrived film, and is certainly not a film that will change your life or much less change you evening you choose to watch it on.The characters are good, but very underdeveloped with many turning up you don't even get a detailed back story from. The premise is the only thing salvageable in this film, and even that can get quite tiring to follow as you've seen it before in past films. Its obviously the reason Eragon did not do well in the cinema, it feels rushed and well forced upon us when we had a far better selection of other films to enjoy at the time of its cinema release.The cast is good, but it feels like they have been under used or under-performed. Clearly the strongest role played in Eragon is by Jeremy Irons and a good voice over from Rachel Weisz, but still its obviously underdeveloped. In all honesty, this is a cheap film for the kids on the weekend to sit down to and not some big movie night title for you and your friends to enjoy. Leave it to the kids on a Saturday morning to enjoy, and for adults choose something you'll actually not spend most of the time criticising.

90,powerfull_jedi,A shallow and soulless fantasy film,4,16 December 2006,"I've been waiting a full year for this movie, I've just returned from the theater sorely disappointed. As someone who read the book almost 2 years ago, the movie adaptation of Paolini's first book from the Inheritance Trilogy, Eragon, comes off as a mindless and random fantasy film that seems to have no identity of it's own, merely copying elements from the most famous of fantasy movies, Star Wars. For those who've read said book, the movie looks like it was adapting a junior novel rather then a serious book, the dialog shows it and do does the acting. The main story is pretty much there,in a world ruled by an evil king who has eradicated all the dragon knights/riders, hunter/farm boy Eragon finds a mysterious stone in the dangerous region's of The Spine, only to find out that it's a dragon's egg, upon hatching the infant dragon chooses Eragon as his rider and soon he discovers that he has the power to change the fate of Alagasea. Seems pretty good and I'll admit the movie starts off pretty well by recreating the scene from the book, but after that you'll start to get shocked on how they managed to screw up an interesting novel. I admit I though the movie was going to something special(judging by the trailers), one recent glance at the IMDb however left me somewhat preoccupied when I read the movie was roughly 100 minutes long, then I started seeing some clips from the movie courtesy of RopesofSilicon, one particular scene looked corny, today when I actually saw it, what a disappointment. Key parts(and characters) of the book are nowhere to be found(village destroyed by Urgals thus causing Eragon to hate them, re-encounter with the sorceress Angela, visiting an old friend of Brom, crossing a major river,Roran's proposal to the butcher's daughter, running away from bandits, crossing the desert, Arya fighting Eragon,etc), some events were changed(Eragon and Brom stalking the Razac, not the other way around, Brom reveals that he's a Dragon Rider in his deathbed,not before, the ending is also entirely different) leaving Eragon one big mess of a film, that's way to short to be convincing even by fantasy standards. Nobody will be convinced at Eragon's transformation into a Dragon Rider, let alone a decent swordsman(apparently killing off the Razac without much trouble, which will affect the outcome of the second and third movies), in this movie and part of the blame lands Ed Speelers, Stefen Fangmeier trying to pull an unknown-actor that unlike others in similar roles(Hayden Christensen, Brandon Routh and Mark Hammil) lacks charisma and talent, making Eragon a cool-looking pretty boy(and a babe-magnet as it seems that Arya looks like she's falling in love with the hero, something unimaginable to who's currently reading the novels, I also wonder did the writers also forgot she was an elf?) rather then the troubled but brave fighter in the book. John Malkovich does very little in the film, other then being the main villain who doesn't even show up in the book(but mentioned), Robert Carlyle does a good job as playing the villain Durza, but the only one who truly shines and seems to be having fun in his role is Jeremy Irons who plays Obi-wan... I mean Brom, Eragon's guardian and the village storyteller/hobo who's actually a dragon rider. The actor who plays Roran, is only there for a couple of minutes only to be completely tossed aside and never to be mentioned again(I wonder how this will play out if they decide to make a second film based on the second book). Rachel Weiz also provides the voice I was expecting and imagined for Saphira. The soundtrack is also good, but a little generic, but the special effects are top-notch, the dragon is truly believable and the Razac seem even more gross then described on the book. Again like I said before, the movie is way too short, too short to even make the characters believable and the plot convincing with very little build-up, the only build-up was the Brom/Eragon relationship which despite not being as largely explored as the novel, is somewhat convincing and Eragon/Saphira, Eragon's bond with Arya and Murtagh, however, is way too fast,it doesn't feel like an epic movie at all(curiously Chronicles of Narnia: LWW is a short novel and a lot of elements are very vague yet Andrew Adams turned it into a Lord of The Rings-like epic, Stefen Fangmeier does the exact same opposite with a lengthy book which features a lot of details). Another major disappointment is the portrayal of the world of Alagasea, we get a couple of villages, one fortress, the interior of what I think it's a throne-room, the Varden's hideout and lots of forest, not a single sight of the greatly detailed cities that abound in the book, just endless forests and hills, sometimes copying similar scenes from the Lord of The Rings movie series. In the end, even for fans of the book, the movie is not worth full price, everybody else wait for the DVD release.",Eragon
91,oovag,Nice,7,25 January 2019,The novel is garbage as usual in fantasy made in USA. The movie is better. I like it.,Eragon
92,Juni78ukr,Mediocre at very best,5,31 December 2006,"Actually I saw Eragon at some kind of press screening about two weeks ago but only today I got enough time for writing some brief comments.I've read Christopher Paolini's book (both of them to be precise) about a month before and to say the truth I wasn't impressed at all. So it's easy to understand that my anticipations weren't sky high although some moments from numerous trailers and clips have drowned my attention. Besides not being a fantasy fan I'm usually quite tolerable to this genre.The only reason that I wasn't particularly disappointed leaving the movie theater were my low expectations. Anyone who expects something more than mediocre fantasy movie or something fresh and original will be clearly disappointed with Eragon. Obviously the biggest desire of the filmmakers was to make the movie as short as it possible. It was a stupid idea. They succeeded in that goal and for the most parts all what is happening on screen looks chaotic and very often illogical. What is more the entire story line of the movie can cause numerous questions and even incomprehension from all viewers who are not familiar with Paolini's book (whether you like it or not). Too many parts of the book were skipped or completely modified. Some fantasy world we know almost nothing about, dragon riders, evil creatures, the tyrant and rebels  all of that is too unclear and undisclosed and besides many of us will find that they have already seen that kind of story several times before. The director also failed in his attempts to impress the audience, make us feel involved in the events on screen. It's just emotionally cold movie with uninteresting poorly developed characters and pathetic villains, who are even more cartoonish and sketchy. What is even worse than that dialogs in the movie seems to be written by a twelve years old. It was so pathetic. The final battle is just a conglomeration of poorly united single scenes without much sense.Now, about what is not so bad. I'm not going to blame Edmund Speelers in anything. He wasn't that bad, although his incapacity to carry the movie on his own is evident to anyone. There is nothing to blame in the supporting actors. They did their job relatively well and the real problem is not in them, it's the imperfection and poor development of their characters. From technical point of view Eragon looks much better. Despite all the fears the dragon looks pretty good. It obviously that the masters of visuals tried to do their best and they are mostly succeeded there. The flying beast was really good and looked quite real both in relative immobility and in flight. Some of the flight scenes became the most impressive in the whole movie. The filming locations are well selected and the scenery is breathtaking. It proves that you don't always have to cross half the world to find good locations for filming.The best grade I can give Eragon is 5 out of 10 and I know that I'm probably too generous here. Thanks for reading.",Eragon
93,westreal,Just for Kids,6,13 January 2007,"I always wondered why there are no movies with Dragons and magic close enough to match LOTR. I've seen D&G,D&G2,Eragon..and many more..but the fact is ..these are just B-movies..or should i say Direct to DVD in comparing to the shining LOTR.The only thing good about this movie is that it has left enough room for sequels...and so maybe we will see them as Direct to DVD not on the big screen as this one.Not a pretty convincing acting by the young artists and old alike..and for a story so complicated it unfolds too fast..with events that have no need one for another.I say this movie is definitely just for kids..(and BTW-i'm a Harry Potter movie fan -but the comparison is way beyond...big big difference). Go see it if u really have this urge but if u can wait ..the DVD should come out soon :P PS:Gave it just 6/10",Eragon
94,Baldrick44,"Well Acted, Badly Scripted...With certain parallels to another movie or two.",6,17 December 2006,"Fantasy has been all the rage and there are two book franchises that have capitalised on it- The Lord of the Rings and Harry Potter. Now comes a third- Eragon, part of the Inheritance trilogy by Christopher Paloni. This movie has drawn certain parallels to Star Wars and it is not difficult to see why. Farm boy Eragon ( Ed Speelers ) has been chosen to ride the Dragon Saphira ( voiced by Rachel Weisz ) against the tyranny of King Galbatorix ( John Malkovich )- another Dragon Rider who was corrupted and turned into an 'Emperor' of sorts ( pun intended ). Said King sends out his trusted lieutenant Durza ( Robert Carlyle ) to eradicate this new menace from his Kingdom before he restores hope to the Varden- a group of 'Rebels'. Eragon thus needs training, with which he gets under the arm of a mysterious old man named Brom ( Jeremy Irons ), who takes Eragon as an 'apprentice' of sorts, teaching him 'the ways' of magic, swordsmanship and riding his beasty.The acting in Eragon is actually quite good, with Irons filling up the role as Brom quite well as you'd expect, and Carlyle making for an excellent Durza ( particularly when his face changes, although why this occurs is not explained at all ). However there is a lot of scenes that come straight from other movies. Durza's speech rallying the troops for battle against the Varden is extremely similarly shot to the Two Tower's Speech at Orthanc with Saruman- except the speech is not as good and the troops sound like they're cheering a golf tournament. And there's the nub- despite the acting ability of the cast, the dialog is clichéd and never really makes the movie unique.Eragon is a movie that would always be compared to two of the greatest book-to-film successes of all time. However it fails not because of this comparison but because it is unable to give the stellar cast the script they deserve, despite the fact they act as if they have.",Eragon
95,FilmCreature,Sorely disappointed,3,28 June 2007,"I think it is sad that other people will probably like Eragon when it is terrible in every category except for the special effects, which are very good. But the editing and acting are all despicable. Edward Speleers, who could have been one of those promising newcomers, is just a kid excited to be in a movie. Sienna Guillory gives the worst performance in the film as the elf Arya, who spends half the movie having a seizure while Jeremy Irons gives lectures on magic to Eragon. I LOVE the book. It is my favorite book of all time. The movie is one of my Top Five worst movies ever (#4). There is a giant gap. And the editing, my god, is awful. It cuts to different scenes at an idiotically fast pace, cramming 419 pages into a pathetic 100-minute kids movie. And to tell other readers, it is nothing like the book. I was really optimistic going into the theater. But boy, was I disappointed. And damn, I took all of my friends to see it. About one-fourth of the way into this movie, I leaned over to the friend next to me and whispered, ""this movie sucks."" And it does. Avoid at all costs.3 dragon eggs out of 10.",Eragon
96,editor-299,So-so dragon tale,6,13 December 2006,"I'll get this off my chest immediately; I am not a big fan of these fantasy/dragon movies. ""Dragon Heart,"" ""Dragon's Liar,"" ""Dragon Blade,"" ""Dragonslayer,"" ""Dragonfly,"" ""Pete's Dragon,"" you name it, I can live without them. In fact, as far as mythological beasts are concerned, I'm more intrigued with the griffin than I am with the dragon. However, since this newest release is not about a griffin, I had to sit through something I was not wild about to begin with. In an attempt to be another franchise fantasy bonanza, like ""The Lord of the Rings,"" ""Eragon"" (from the ""Inheritance"" trilogy  whatever that is) was launched. And just because the books were written by a teenager doesn't mean they are good. In fact, it means just the opposite.Sure, the kid, Christopher Paolina (now 23), was just 15 when he began the series, and certain license should be given for youth; but age is no discretion when it comes to larceny. After all, look at the boyish-faced group of Fagen's artful dodgers if you don't believe me.""Eragon"" steals frequently and unabashedly during its rather sparse 1 hour 40 minute lifetime; pickpocketing ""The Neverending Story,"" ""Excalibur,"" ""The Princess Bride,"" ""Braveheart"" and many of the aforementioned dragon flicks.Heck, the title is even a bastardization of a leading character in LOTR. Still, the set location is beautiful (New Zealand, where else?), and the special effects are competently created.Plus, the acting pedigree, especially from Oscar winners Jeremy Irons (""Reversal of Fortune"") as the mentor and former dragon-rider, Brom; and Rachel Weisz (""The Constant Gardner"") as the voice of the beast, Saphira, puts this a notch about the usual fantasy dreck. Add to this the interesting villains, evil King Galbitorix (John Malkovich) and his despicable sorcerer, Durza (Robert Carlyle, ""The Full Monty""), and the film is not all that bad.Not that I would ever pay to see it mind you, but it does have it's good moments; the least of which is its obvious setup for the upcoming sequel, due out next year (if this installment takes off).",Eragon
97,LordJiggy,Doomed by Ineptness,5,16 December 2006,"This film is barely worth matinée price. My 12 year old son, not the most discriminating audience, enjoyed it. Parts of it were diverting, but mostly it was an exercise in tedium. It began to be fun seeing all the places the director proved how clueless he was. Bad cuts, wretched pacing and a complete lack of how to build emotion in a scene. The lead actor, young Edward, might have been good with a decent director, even a hack like Ted Kotcheff would have put together something at least competent. Here are the spoilers: Jeremy Irons and Robert Caryle are in a different movie altogether. Every time they're on the screen, however briefly, it feels like a real film, and hope is renewed. Then, they're whisked away by some shabby rip off from LOTRs, and you're left bereft. Sorry, I wanted to like this, or at least, enjoy it.",Eragon
98,vampiresan,The book was written by a 16 year old but the film was far more juvenile,1,15 December 2006,"Why are so many adaptations of reasonable books so badly done? Is it that the scriptwriters and directors want to remove themselves so much from the source material that they feel the need to stuff it up altogether. Frankly nothing saves this film... it gravitates between being unbelievably slow and sentimental to fights scenes that are so fast and badly directed that it is impossible to tell what the hell is going on. Did they run out of money and decide not to hire a focus puller?The acting by all concerned is woeful but they are really not helped by the trite and simplistic dialogue given to them. The dialogue in the book wasn't anywhere near this bad so why didn't they just use some of that?Rachel Weiss as the voice of Sapphira got the shortest straw with most of her dialogue being stupid, repetitive or downright pointless. They could have cut the whole dragon talking thing and no real information would have been lost. Overall it was so badly done that I am sure it is something that all concerned will drop from their resumes very soon.",Eragon
99,ajaws4ever,"A humongous disappointment. If the movie was exactly like the book, it would have been so amazing. Boo!",5,14 December 2006,"The book of Eragon was excellent (at least until it got like halfway into the book), but the movie was such a disappointment.Eragon stars Edward Speleers, Jeremy Irons (The Lion King (the voice of Scar), Die Hard: With a Vengeance, Reversal of Fortune), Sienna Guillory (Resident Evil: Apocalypse, Love Actually, Inkheart (filming)), Robert Carlyle (Dead Fish, The Mighty Celt), John Malkovich (Ripley's Game, The Libertine), and Garrett Hedlund (Four Brothers, Friday Night Lights).Okay, the only reason I gave this movie a 5 and not a 2 was because of the awesome special effects!Eragon. A film that is loaded with absolutely stunning special effects, although a couple that just made you roll your eyes. Edward Speleers was okay. He didn't really know how to really, oh, what's the word, um...act very good, or impress the audience. Everyone also was either okay at acting or really sucked at it.The special effects were absolutely stunning. Saphira the dragon looked so real! The filmmakers did Saphira so well that they actually made it seem like Saphira actually existed! And her voice wasn't quite what I had expected, but it was still awesome...it fitted Saphira's character so well. But, Saphira seemed to be the only thing the filmmakers focused on. All of the other special effects made me roll my eyes or made me sigh heavily.If the movie would have been exactly like the book, it would have been totally amazing. It would have been so much better than what it is now. Hopefully Eldest won't be such a brutal disappointment as Eragon is. Why is it that all of the great books turn into horrible movies? The only good books that turn into good movies are Harry Potter, A Series of Unfortuante of Events, Lord of the Rings, and Star Wars. Like I said, hopefully the Eldest movie won't be as disappointing, because the Eldest book was so much better and amazing than the Eragon book.The movie may be a PG, but it's pretty violent. It's almost as violent as the book! It's like one millimeter away from being a PG-13. Even The Chronicles of Narnia was going to be a PG-13, but the filmmakers cut some stuff out of there that would've been to violent for younger children who loved the tale and the movie.Violence/Gore: 8/10 (strong for a PG), Sex/Nudity: 1/10, Profanity: 1/10, Drugs/Alcohol: 0/10Original MPAA rating: PG: Fantasy Violence, Intense Battle Sequences, and Some Frightening ImagesMy MPAA rating: PG-13: Fantasy Violence, Intense Battle Sequences, and Some Frightening Images and MomentsMy Canadian rating: PG or 14A: Violence, Frightening Scenes",Eragon

I liked the book but this wasn't the best. Speeler's acting was mediocre and it didn't exactly follow the book, but oh shoot, it was certainly entertaining. The special effects were not stunning like the BRILLIANT ones in X Men: The Last Stand but they were acceptable. Saphira looked pretty cool and Brom was such a good character. My favorite still is and always has been Murtagh because he was excellent. Mr. Hedlund did amazing and was the best actor, next to Jeremy. Siena was acceptable although she was a terrible fighter, but I think that was just Arya.This film was certainly enjoyable in every way and you will more than likely love it.

Before I go into the bad things, let's talk about what's good:Jeremy Irons did his best to work with absolutely NOTHING... I applaud his effort.The CG and scenery were good, but nothing to write home about compared to Lord of the RingsUm... that's it...The bad:The acting was very wooden and unnatural... not horrible, but not good either.The story was a merging of Star Wars with Lord of the Rings, with a bit of Dungeons and Dragons thrown in. I don't know what the book is like, but the author/writer clearly was influenced by the two stories and merged them together... An example you ask?Eragon = Luke Princess Arya = Princes Leia King Galbatorix/Durza = Emperor/Darth Vader Magic = Force Varden Stronghold = Helm's DeepThere was even a sunset scene with Eragon sitting on cliff looking out into the horizon! I was only surprised that there weren't two suns in the sky!The dialogue... OH MY, the dialogue was horrible! As you can see in the FIRST line of the movie, it did not get to a good start. Every line delivered was painful to hear, and sometimes you just cannot believe that the characters are uttering such gibberish. I took a quick look at the book at Borders after the movie, and it was definitely better written than the dialogue in the movie. All in all, it was a movie where I laughed out loud with my friends multiple times (and not for good reason) and kept on throwing out LOTR and Star Wars references throughout the movie. I went in with very low expectations, but I didn't expect an ""epic"" (only 90 minutes long) movie like this would be THAT bad...

DRAGON: ""us. together. how many times do I have to say it. together. are you some kind of idiot? t-o-g-e-t-h-e-r."" I understand the rule of screen writing where you're supposed to have emotional peaks, but this was insane. every scene had two lines of dialogue then there would swell up some important music, creating a thunder clap of emotional release. ERAGON: ""how did the dragon choose me?"" PRINCESS: ""dragons choose with their heart."" Dun-dun-dun. DUN DUN DUN DUN DUN. Duuunnn Duuuunnnnn. (that's the music). I got to the point where I was trying to decide if this movie could have been about anything, a tennis player, a mountain biker, a witch, a Jedi, a poker player, and yes it could have been about anything. our hero is at an emotionally sensitive age and discovers a new power or skill. our hero is also aware of an outside force or enemy who wants the power or skill. our hero has an internal struggle between using the skill and keeping it secret. if he uses the skill, the enemy may try to take it away or destroy the hero; if he hides the skill, he may be able to develop it, but he could miss an opportunity to use it for gain. now our external characters come in to influence the hero's decision, in this case, a pretty girl and an old man. So far, this movie sounds just like Star Wars. I couldn't tolerate the formula. but like I said, I kept telling myself it's only a movie.

105,dreamdemon-1,Decent enough,10,17 December 2006,"While the movie fails to do justice to the book, this is only to be expected as no movie inspired by a book ever managed to give life to the story. LOTR may have been the closest, but not just there yet.This one is a lower budget ecranisation but the results are good (great given the resources the producers had at their disposal). The story may be a star-wars rip-off but that's Paulini's fault.Despite that, the story has a warm feeling about it and my regret is that save for a three-four characters, there isn't much insight into the world. Yes, we get the story about the evil Galbatorix and such, but I still feel many unanswered questions: what were the other races doing when Galbatorix was taking power? Who exactly was princess Arya? Why and how did Galbatorix acquire the egg and why did he keep it (knowing it will hatch only near its rider) ? We get Eragon & Brom's background and a lot of insight on them, little on Galbatorix ... and nothing on Arya, Murtagh or Durza.The acting was decent, to me unexpectedly good. However Malkovich was a little dull as Galbatorix and Speeler just plain awful as Eragon. I can't really stress how annoying Speeler was, acting with so little feeling that to me it was nearly impossible to feel anything for him. He had good chemistry with Irons however and I guess that eventually promoted Irons as I found him excellent as Brom.Sapphira's character however (animated dragon voiced by Weisz) was the cherry on top of the cake as all about her was perfect. Beautiful design and animation, especially in the baby version, with a little humor to fill in until her full growth appearance.All in all a pleasant experience but too brief and I'm guessing that only Paulini's fans will get to fully enjoy it as only they can fill in the gaps this movie plants all over.8/10 just for Brom and Sapphira.",Eragon
106,filmfan92,DragonHeart-less,3,4 January 2007,"While the book on which the film ""Eragon"" is based has been the cause for much debate among fantasy fans (it's plagiarism! no, its the masterpiece of the century! the characters are boring! Paolini takes time to let his story unfold!), the response to the film has been unanimously negative. I told myself that it would just be another ""Narnia"", a well-made, fairly impressive film ragged on by critics who expected another Lord of the Rings. Well, let's just say the critics were right for once. The film opens with a lengthy shots that soars through the clouds to reveal a ""breathtaking"" CGI land of mountains and pretty ponds while Jeremy Irons flatly intones a prologue that indulges in every fantasy cliché there ever once (Alagaesia was once a peaceful land. Now, we are in darkness, under the shadow of tyranny...,). Then, after the final line of the prologue (""The king was in agony with his stone""), we cut to tall tower with an eerie light peeking out, which means that's where the bad guys are, as indicated by both ""Narnia"" and ""LOTR"". This tower is home to King Galbatorix, the chief baddie, played by the hopelessly miscast John Malkovich, who immediately says, in a tone of such Blofeld-like villainy that you could see him stroking a white Persian, ""I suffer without my stone."" Right from the off, I knew the flaw in this one would be the writing, and oh, how right I was. The script is full of horrible, horrible dialog I cannot even begin to describe, and, worst of all, it attempts to destroy the books narrative completely. Now, normally, I am fine with this (c'mon, when a books 500 pages, somethings gotta go), but here, the writer has done the book an atrocity by practically creating an original story all his own, and sprinkling portions of the book here and there to satisfy fans. The actors are all talented, and do what the can with such awful dialog. Some, such as Ed Speleers and Rachel Weisz, do an excellent job in their roles, but others, such as Malkovich and Djimon Honsou crash and burn. Occasionally, director Stefen Fangmeier will inject the film with a moment of visual beauty of a single line of striking dialog. But it's not enough. Just. not. enough.",Eragon
107,scrapmetal7,ERAGON review,3,31 December 2006,"ERAGON was made to follow in the recent tradition of faithful adaptations of popular fantasy books, like the LORD OF THE RINGS, HARRY POTTER, and NARNIA movies. These movies are supposed to rise above the typical fantasy/sci-fi genre and astound audiences of all ages with the strength of their stories, cinematography, and special effects. Unfortunately, it is very clear early on that ERAGON belongs not with these well-made literate films, but rather alongside '80's efforts like BEASTMASTER and DEATHSTALKER.Here's a plot summary: take the plot of the original STAR WARS movie, remove the spaceships, and add dragons. Really, it is that blatant. There's a young idiot on his uncle's farm, his friend goes off to war and he's jealous, his uncle is slain, he gains an older mentor, there's an evil king who was once a Jedi-i mean a starfighter-i mean a Dragonrider, but he betrayed the other Jedis and slew them all, there's a Princess in trouble, there's a brash, confident battle buddy, the older mentor is slain, the boy must fight in his first an aerial battle and he achieves victory and glory, yet the war continues...the end.ERAGON is afflicted with all the things I despise about fantasy and sci-fi: the whiny young idiot protagonist with a destiny, the mysterious hot girl he is thrown together with and wins her heart, invented languages, and an ignorant, immature view about how wars are fought. It also has everything I despise about bad movie-making, including poor editing, bad dialogue, clichéd scenes and characters, a predictable plot and a terrible, intrusive musical score.",Eragon

Why would such a thing bother people. Is there some other problem here.

Said object is found by a young farm boy who is yearning to get away from his humdrum life but has obligations which keep him there. There is a scene of him staring wistfully into the sunset outside his home. He meets an old man who saves his life and who knows about what is happening and sees the boys destiny. It transpires that this old man is almost the last of a group of mystical knights who once ruled the world fairly and justly but were betrayed by one of their own and hunted down and killed, bringing in the current tyranny. He sees the boy has the power to be another of these knights but the boy is reluctant to join him, only doing so after the troops of the evil overlord have killed his adoptive family whilst searching for what he found earlier. The two travel to meet with some rebels, with whom the princess was allied and along the way the old man becomes a mentor to the boy, teaching him how use his powers. After a brief stop at a seedy town the mission is diverted to rescue the princess from the evil overlord and his henchmen. They sneak in to the overlord's domain and against all odds rescue the princess but the mentor figure is killed in the process by the evil sorcerer. After some blubbering the boy and the princess finally meet up with the rebels, unknowingly leading the forces of evil to the previously secret base. There is a big battle and the rebels win against the odds with the boy coming into his own, defeating the evil sorcerer in combat. The forces of good have triumphed for the time being.Now, I am talking about Star Wars or Eragon? The movie stars a bland young actor called Ed Speleers who is too much of a blank slate to carry a movie and lacks any supporting characters with any personality or charisma. Not even from reliable and colourful actors such as John Malkovich, Jeremy Irons and Robbie Carlyle, among others. There are no particularly good or exciting action scenes and despite the decent CGI and the purportedly epic scope the movie feels pokey and small. The script is clunky and full of bad, and more importantly boring, dialogue which even the better actors can't do anything with. There are lame plot contrivances and schmaltzy, saccharine scenes involving the young hero and his dragon. There are laughable character and place names that sound like somebody picked out letters at random, such as Alagaesia and Galbatorix.Yes, I am talking about Eragon.Okay, one of two of things could arguably be said about Star Wars but fortunately not the starring Ed Speleers thing. Basically Eragon is a poorly made fantasy film that apes Star Wars to a staggering degree, which was not a hugely original movie, way of the Lord of the Rings movies, but has almost none of the entertainment value. Unless you're watching it to rag on it, give Eragon a miss.",Eragon

112,im_veritas_photo,Eragon : Only A Few Redeeming Characteristics,5,12 February 2009,"A true introduction: Once upon a time, though not so long ago, in a Far-Southwestern Wyoming High-Desert town, a once-proud theater burned. Essentially gutted, its ruined walls still precariously half-stand. Its roof is gone; the winter snow on the sloping floor is stained grey with the ashes left behind. Even the name of the business was eradicated, but one readable item remains, a movie poster in a somehow-still-intact glass case facing the street: ""Eragon"".It is said that this movie Eragon stems from the first book of the Inheritance Trilogy, written by Christopher Paolini. The entire structure of the film indicates planned followups, the 2nd and 3rd parts to come on film; I don't think anything has been done with these plans. After seeing this jewel, I personally don't care if this as-yet-unsequeled situation remains forever unchanged.This is a film of very mixed blessings. At times, the dialog is sublime; at other moments, it makes the worst Hollywood hack-written scripts seem positively wonderful in comparison.The production values are, I think, better than average. There is a really fine musical score. I usually dislike computer-graphics in most films, but these are better than just acceptable to me.Eragon was filmed, apparently, in Hungary, Slovokia, and British Columbia. The mountain shots, very nicely done, bring to mind the New Zealand mountains of the Lord of the Rings films, but these just don't quite equal LotR. As a matter of fact, once those comparisons begin, Eragon just comes off as a second-or-worse-rate swipe at the Lord of the Rings, in so many ways. I think the LotR series is not nearly as superb as do other folks; but Eragon isn't even that good.The actors range from fine to those who can only be described as wooden-faced, monotonic, emotionless, stumbling mumblers.Jeremy Irons has a big part as a forcibly-retired dragon rider; I think he brings much class to an otherwise mediocre film. Unfortunately, the script has him killed off two-thirds of the way through; too bad, it only went downhill from there.John Malkovich, always good as bad guys, is fine in his bit part: the evil king Galbatorix (where did the writer come up with these ridiculous names), bringing as much professionalism to his part as humanly possible. But he is eclipsed by Robert Carlyle as the hyperbolic meanie Durza, Galbatorix's right-hand-baddie. Carlyle brings the appropriate amount of campy, over-the-top, demonic evil into this sword-and-sorcery (-and-dragon) epic.Impossibly handsome young Edward Speleers, in the lead role, undoubtedly appeals to pre-pubescent females, and to those with IQs and hormonal levels of that ilk. I give him fair-to-good marks for his acting, but it's just wasted on this juvenile pot-boiler.It is ironic that the best actor in the film is, for me, the made-totally-by-special-effects dragon, Saphira, voiced so well by actress Rachel Weisz. Are all dragons female? So this movie implies. But, of course, that begs the question: How are dragon eggs made? Oh well... There are thousands of never-to-be-resolved questions of this nature engendered by the seriously-flawed script.So, all-in-all, this is a bad-to-good-to-flawed film that is, nonetheless, fun to see at least once. One viewing is all of Eragon that most folks can tolerate. 5 out of 10.",Eragon
113,nabor7,Waste of Time,3,23 April 2007,"I haven't read the book and after seeing the movie I don't want to. There are too many close comparisons to Tolkien's works which makes this seem like an author trying to cash in on the success of the Lord of the Rings trilogy. The close storyline and similar names to the Lord of the Rings projected this as a cheap theatrical release using the success of another. The only redeeming thing about the movie was the dragon. The special effects were OK but the acting was stiff, with the dialog mainly short, broken sentences. I watched this on PPV and just prior to viewing, a storm knocked my satellite dish out of adjustment and I was frantically readjusting it to regain my signal. Unfortunately I did. For better viewing watch the Veggietale ""Lord of the Beans"".",Eragon
114,fatemaster2003,What in the world is happening to Eragon?,1,17 May 2007,"First of all, this movie really doesn't suit the great story in it's book. I've read the book, and I found it very interesting. I thought, the movie will go well, just like the lord of the ring. But, the reality, it's disappointing. The acting is bad enough, that even someone without a skill to act, can do the acting much better than the actor in this movie. The director, sure lacks a lot of directing skill. I mean, how come, a great story book like Eragon, turn out like this? I'm very disappointed. Luckily I didn't watch it on the theater. I just watch it on DVD, and I felt like, it's better for me to have some sleep, rather than watch this movie.Despite the fact that this movie is bad, the only great thing about this movie, is the dragon. The sound doesn't betray the quality of the dragon itself. But other than that, this movie really goes down. If this movie was directed by Peter Jackson or someone who is great at making an epic movie, this movie is going to be great. But unfortunately, it's not.Bad acting, bad script, a fair story nonetheless. I rate it 1/10.",Eragon
115,moviegeek310,Eragon just plain stinks!,3,18 December 2006,"I read many reviews before seeing ""Eragon"", all were negative, and the trailer looked campy, so my expectations were set very low. They couldn't be low enough for me to like this movie though. Everything feels rushed, the acting is absolutely horrible from previously respectable actors, and the script seems to have been written by the master of bad scripts; George Lucas. Even he could've done a better job though. Get this, ""Eragon"" was directed by Stefen Fangmeier, who has never directed before, all he's done is visual effects. Why Fox 2000 put so much money into a movie directed by an FX artist is beyond me. Also, every scene seems to have been ripped from ""Star Wars"" and made to look like ""Lord of the Rings"". There is no originality here, none at all. That is partly the book writer's fault; Christopher Paolini. The ""Eragon"" books are among the worse ever written, and I've read some real doosies. His writing is horrible to read.I won't go into plot details, partly because I don't want anyone wasting money on this. But really all you have to do is think of ""Star Wars"" then add a dragon, and pointy swords, and you've got ""Eragon"" in a nutshell. The worst thing about this is that even though it's only 95 minutes long, it still feels like forever. It is so boring, and it drags and drags. Fans of the book will be infuriated at the liberties the filmmakers took. The book takes place over a year, but the movie appears to take place over a couple days, so none of the movie makes sense. In one scene the baby dragon off and suddenly grows large in little puffs of fire right before Eragons' eyes, when really it takes the dragon months to grow. The acting is another thing, perfectly good actors from John Malkovich, to Jeremy Irons, to one of my new favorites; Djimon Hounsou, are totally wasted in horrendous dialogue, and they end up just looking stupid. Newcomer Edward Speelers plays a great pansy. The only semi-good actor was Robert Carlyle as Durza, a very creepy bad guy, but even he looked ridiculous at times.If you want to watch good fantasy, watch ""Lord of the Rings"" for the 24th time, or to see the story told a million times better, watch ""Star Wars"" for the 100th time. I feel as if the fantasy genre is fading, thought provoking, and feel good films are slowly taking over. We should enjoy fantasy while we have it, but not this. I give it 3 out of 10. ""Eragon"" is rated PG for fantasy violence, intense battle sequences and some frightening images",Eragon
116,sweetrupturedlight,Botched from start to finish,4,15 January 2007,"i saw Eragon yesterday and all i can say is: What.a.botched.movieOnly my opinion, but i thought this was awful. Really bad. I don't usually use strong adjectives, but this was just so incredibly.. bad!!You cannot prevent using Lord of the Rings as a yardstick.. but i will leave that for later and focus on the story first..Firstly, the cast: I have no real issues with anyone cast. The young actor who plays the lead role, is OK. He is certainly good looking and plays the role with the 'wide-eyed' innocence i suspect the filmmakers were looking for. I think its his first film, and if that is the case, then i think he should be pleased with his debut. Really, not bad at all.I love Rachel Weiss, but why choose her as the voice of Zaphira? I thought it was out of place and i could never forget i was listening to Rachel instead of focusing on the what the dragon/character had to say. With that said, i was so unsatisfied with what i was seeing, that perhaps Rachel was actually the only shining light.The Plot: Here is where i stop applauding anything. The story was a mess from the beginning. I believe that this was written as a trilogy.. and they took the fact that it needs to be a success to make the subsequent sequels for granted. There is so much left unexplained. As the viewer, you are left wading through a maze of characters who are paper-thin with mystery and legend thrown in for good measure, all of which has no cohesion what-so-ever. Nothing is explained fully. Some things glazed over unsatisfactorily. Characters come and go.. some who seem to have no place being there to begin with. Joss Stone as the fortune teller appears for a second.. departs some non-news worthy information and the scene ends so abruptly, i was left wondering what just happened. Not to mention bad acting too.. *ouch* Eragon's cousin had no place in the movie at all. What was his purpose? Unless its meant for the next movie.. in which case it wasted our time completely. His mother is frequently hinted at, but her abandonment of Eragon never explained. Another thing left for the next installment? Where is his father? Why is he never mentioned? The boy who turns out to be the son of the enemy.. Of all people, i expected a greater explanation of his character. He at least seemed to hint at being marginally more exciting to explore. Instead we see a scar and we are left to figure out the rest by ourselves. Jeremy Irons does nothing to further the story. We hardly learn anything about his character before he dies. He does not impart ANY knowledge to the young rider, that he didn't already know. He does not teach ANY new skill which he does not already possess. In the end we are left with a man-child who basically gets a dragon, rides it and then goes to fight the evil baddies.. and shock shock.. defeats a powerful shade! Makes NO sense at all. Also, Eragon learns, or rather is told what 3 elvish words are.. boom! Next scene he is casting spells! Where did that come from? Throughout the movie we are told that spells and riding and skill takes time.. but Eragon learns everything in about a matter of minutes.Also, the girl.. Arya.. Her presence is never explained either. I was left wondering who she was exactly and where she fit in. She is played up as whom i suspect will become the love interest for the hero in the sequels, but she looks much older and wiser than Eragon, making him look like a silly youth in the throws of a crush. The final scene of the move left me cringing. I kept thinking.. please don't kiss. It will be too humiliating to watch.In the end, i watched the movie cursing the impetuous youth for his silly willfulness, then alternatively cursing the filmmakers for taking a story with such potential and mucking it up so incredibly badly. I am really not one to moan too much about bad movies. I love my fair share. But this was just sad to watch.Finally, you cannot escape the comparison to Lord of the Rings. Not that Eragon even deserves to be whispered in the same breath as LoTR, but frankly, many an idea in this movie was stolen from Peter Jackson's Trilogy. The shade-guy.. (i forget his name) looks like a clone, if not one with a little more spine - of Gríma Wormtongue. The demonic evil warriors look suspiciously like Orc and the final battle is reminiscent of a similar stand - good vs evil - at the battle of Helmsdeep. No sequels please. This was painful enough!All in all, i suggest you wait till this hits the rental store.. and even then.. i'd wait till it hit your TV screen.2/10",Eragon

118,GrimmBrother,Eragon doesn't live up to past fantasy epics,5,24 December 2006,"That time of year has come for our annual fantasy epic fix to hit our big screens. For the past few years we've had the Harry Potter films, Lord of the Rings and the first film in the Chronicles of Narnia series at our cinemas and now we have the first book in the Inheritance series, Eragon (that's dragon with an e not a d).Eragon was written by a then 15-year-old Christopher Paolini. But just because it was written by someone so young doesn't mean it can't be good, does it? After all there are plenty of talented young writers out there, but most of them don't steal ideas from so many other epic novels or films.So does Eragon live up to the other summer fantasy epics we've been having for the past few years? No, not quite.Eragon is mostly Star Wars in Middle Earth and Lord of the Rings with a dragon, thrown in with a large amount of CGI wizardry. Okay, so maybe there is a lot more to it but that is what everybody is making it out to be.Eragon's plot is not entirely original. It is about a young farm boy whose name is Eragon who stumbles across a dragon egg that was destined for him as he is the next dragon rider. An evil lord is after the egg and will do everything in his power to get it. When tragedy strikes Eragon's family, he goes on a quest to avenge them.The acting is mediocre, besides a magnificent performance by a dragon who goes by the name Saphira (voiced by Rachel Weiz). It is a shame actually that the best actor is the dragon. She is after all the character with the most depth, seeing as all the others were mostly two-dimensional cardboard cut-outs.The dialogue was corny and the storyline was clichéd. According to fans of the book, the film has no right to be called Eragon because it strays so far from the original plot from the book.Eragon offers nothing new to the premise of ""normal young boy thrown into extraordinary circumstances and then asks why me"".I don't know what is with these book to film adaptations. The filmmakers can never get them right. Besides the Chronicles of Narnia and the first two Harry Potter films, every other fantasy epic turned into a film is completely changed. Some Eragon fans are asking the question ""Did the filmmakers even read the book?"" Having not read any of the books in the Inheritance series, I cannot say whether this film is a good adaptation, but judging from the outcry from many of the fans it appears that the film is hardly faithful to the book.I suppose it was released at the same time worldwide so that the critics couldn't get their hands on it first and tear it to shreds, leaving hardly any tickets sold and any hope for a sequel abandoned.I have no clue why on earth the film company 20th Century Fox chose Stefen Fangmeier as the director. First of all he has no directing experience whatsoever and he was chosen to take on a project as large as Eragon. Fangmeier is a special effects supervisor who has been involved in films such as Lemony Snicket's a Series of Unfortunate Events and Master and Commander. He took the direction by putting the special effects in front of the story and characters, which is a major movie no-no.I wouldn't mind seeing the sequel Eldest as a film, considering the fact that it is said to be much better than Eragon because the author had more experience and talent as a writer by the time he wrote it.Eragon is not a bad movie, but in the words of Brom, Eragon's friend, I expected more.6/10",Eragon
119,drama59,Magical Mystical Family Film,10,5 July 2007,"I have not read the books but all I know is this is a Magical Mystical Journey in the days of Knights, Dragons & Heroes. The cast is wonderful and the dragon is amazing. I was enthralled with the entire movie. A Movie beautiful to watch with the amazing special effects, great costumes and superb cast. This is a movie you will love if you are 3 or 93. A fairy tale filled with live actors and lots of action. Ed Speleers is a marvelous young actor with talent and charisma - very fitting for our hero. If you want to be taken away then get this movie. I cannot wait for a sequel. I wish we had more clean wholesome movies for the whole family to watch. Bravo!",Eragon
120,Nyx_Selene,Maybe it's cool if you're a kid...?,2,17 March 2011,"Note: Spoilers ahead.""Eragon"" is about the young idiot Eragon, who lives in Hobbiton.Okay, maybe not, but his home looks a bit too much like it for it to be coincidental. In fact, the entire movie looks like the sets came from a LotR yard sale. Some of the opening scenes as well, sadly. I've never heard an evil king open with a line like ""I suffer without my stone"", though, so that's new. He does so because it was stolen from him, by people who've ""been carrying it for as long as we can remember"". I don't get it.Anyway, Eragon is a 17-year-old farm boy who finds this blue stone/egg, and it hatches into a blue, telepathic dragon that grows up in about 2 days. Because of this, the evil king wants him dead, 'cause the king went through a lot a trouble killing off all dragons except his own, so he's not really happy that there's a new one. By this point, Eragon's uncle gets killed by something resembling chirping shrubs, and his cousin has run off to avoid being drafted, so the poor guy is left with the dragon as his only friend and family.However, a local bum turns out to be a former dragon rider, so he takes Eragon under his protection, and they go on a quest to find the freedom fighters ""the Varden"", to mobilize against the evil king. Now that a naive brat has a dragon, victory against the king's army is more or less guaranteed, you see. During the trip the older, wiser rider tries to teach the younger, dumber one some valuable lessons, but since Eragon is an idiot, he gets his teacher killed. How? Well, he dreams about this 13 years older stranger-girl who's being held prisoner at an enemy stronghold. Of course, he needs to go save her. Don't know why, and I don't know why he thinks he's the perfect person to do it. He nearly gets them all killed.They eventually find the Varden, who turns out to be Africans, Scots and who knows what, since they're dressed in gold chain-mail and silk burkas and live in Minas Tirith – sorry, the mountains. These people make absolutely no sense to me. What are they supposed to be? They're hiding among mountains after having fled from the king's army, and unless their leader is immortal, they can't have been there more than 10-15 years. Still, the upper sections of the ""hideout"" are delicately cut directly out of the rocks, but the lower ones consist of mud, and wooden poles tied together with rope. People are dressed in the most colorful and intricately patterned get-ups possible – preferably in expensive materials too. Except for the Scots, who're paranoid enough to wear armor 24-7, it seems. Who the hell are these people? Why do they think their clothes are more important than their defenses? They run into battle in long green-pink-yellow skirts and so much bling they make more noise than the invading army. Is all this explained in the book? I haven't read it.Moving on, they're all attacked by some tattooed guys, and the king's army. Why I can't fathom. There's at least 24 hours between the enemy forces finding the Varden, and the actual attack. Why doesn't the king just fly in with his dragon and torch the lot as soon as he finds out the location? Then there'd be him, his dragon, his army and his sorcerer against a 17-year-old and a newly hatched dragon. I'd prefer those odds, if I were him.But no, he leaves the dragon safely at home, and sends the army instead. An army that apparently consists largely or partly by the forced and unwilling, since the king drafts people from every village. They're lead by the sorcerer, Durza – who is, by the way, the only interesting thing in this entire movie. An army of oppressed, drafted people, set up to fight against freedom fighters I wouldn't trust that to go well, but maybe Durza has some Jedi mind trick to keep them from deserting.Moving on again, Eragon's dragon picks this exact moment to grow up enough to breath fire, and they save the day. They also kill the sorcerer, sadly, making sure that we'll have that much less to keep us awake in a possible sequel. Not that I expect that anybody will be making one anytime soon.The movie mostly just feels stupid. The acting is really bad in most places, to the extent that I've seen better among 14-year-olds in live role-playing games. The all around plagiarizing of Lord of the Rings doesn't help, even if the almost-Balrog in the end looks nice. And I have nothing against Rachel Weisz or her voice, but why does Eragon's dragon sound like his mother? Especially when you just KNOW that the king's huge, black, bad-ass dragon is going to sound like Darth Vader? So yes, maybe it's cool if you're a very young kid. I'm guessing they're the targeted audience anyway.",Eragon
121,Listen_to_the_Law,Not near as bad as some say it is,6,15 April 2007,"Eragon, the first of a promised trilogy of epic adventure movies based off the book series that I should've probably read by now, is a hit or miss movie based on how you look at it. On one side is the person who has read that book. Since that's not me, these will just be attempted guesses. I read all the Harry Potter books, and even though I loved the movies, I still thought that they left out way too much. Well, with Eragon, supposedly, a ton of vital book elements were left out (like Eragon learning magic and the dragon maturing- both of which were obviously rushed to people who didn't read the book). On the other side is a person who hasn't read the books. They (read: me) are just looking to go and experience a lower-quality (but in no means bad) Lord of the Rings movie-pilot with a great story, great characters/acting, and beautiful nature scenes. Eragon had about half of that down pat, but the other half was flawed, severely.Eragon is a story based on a farm-boy (Eragon- Ed Speelers) who happens to stumble upon a large, cartoonish blue dragon egg in the forest outside his farm. Soon (too soon) the egg hatches into a baby dragon that is admittedly cute (it looks like my catonly in dragon form). Then in about five minutes, the dragon flies behind some trees and grows into a full size beast (along with a female voice). Saphira, as the dragon is named, is my favorite character in the movie. Although she clearly doesn't listen to herself speak (corny phrases abound), she can get away with it.Aside from Eragon and Saphira, not that many other characters are that important. In fact, Eragon and Saphira are only characters that I can even clearly remember, besides the old man who plays Obi Wan to Eragon's Luke. Too bad I can't remember his nameor any other character for that matter. It's not that I have a bad memory (believe me, I don't- I can remember lots of unimportant facts), it's just that the movie did nothing to build any characters besides Eragon and Saphira. The rebellious emo-like man who joins sides with Eragon and his alliance during the climatic battle is cool, but not enough attention was put into him, except that he is the son of an evil wizard-person (think of Scar's son in Lion King 2).Anyone remember Casino Royale? Of course you do! In there we had Le Chieffre, the bad guy on the scene, and the higher-up bad guy, Mr. White. Eragon follows the same formula, but no one knows anything about either of them except that they act atrociously, especially when they're talking to each other. All of this can be blamed on one thing- that being that Eragon was clearly rushed. The first half hour scream ""director out of time,"" and while things make more sense as they go on, the rushed storyline is a problem throughout.To sum up Eragon, it's got a lot going for it. Although this first film had its share of flaws, it was very entertaining, which is the most important aspect. I believe that if Eragon 2 isn't rushed, it shall be very good. Although Eragon and Saphira are bounded together with corny dialogue, they also are together on a very powerful new trilogy of which I look forward to continue viewing.",Eragon
122,myrkeyjones,"A great big movie, without a soul",1,13 December 2006,"Its seems that fantasy is the currant rage with motion pictures, what with obviously the hugely successful Lord of the Rings Trilogy and the Great but flawed Chronicles of Narnia adaption, and also Next year the Nicole Kidman and Daniel Craig starring Golden Compass Trilogy. Well eragon is entertaining claptrap at best, but as a motion picture it suffers from wooden acting and an very cheesy screenplay. Even some of the effects are low-par. There is also some shocking continuity and plot holes. Is Eragon a cheap rip-job to make some money in the wake of the fantasy craze, yep. With great actor's like John Malcovich, Jeremy Irons and Robert Caryle, you would think that this prestige would satisfy, but their performances are surprisingly wooden. The lead character eragon comes off as a fudged pretty boy. There were so many moments to make fun of, particularly the unintentional gay innuendo in the screenplay. The only light in this film is Sienna Guillory, who does her best to create a competent heroin. Eragon is a great big movie, with no soul. Recommendation: Avoid at best, but makes for a great comedy.",Eragon
123,superduperspit,"Lacking, lacking, lacking. Can't help but compare it, to much better fantasy films released recently.",4,20 December 2006,"What most dooms Eragon is the fact that, as hard as it tries to be different, it is impossible for the viewer to not help but draw comparisons to ""Lord of the Rings,"" be it plot, visuals, acting, script, and setting. Being forced to compare this to such a great trilogy does not help this fantasy adventure film out, because in every aspect, it falls greatly under the high bar set by ""Rings."" The biggest problem that the film faces is Eragon himself, played by Edward Speelers, a guy in his late teens who has had no acting experience whatsoever. It really shows. Although neither Elijah Wood (who played Frodo) or Daniel Radcliff (who plays Harry Potter) were phenomenal actors or the core of their fantasy franchises, they at least managed to create emotional depth that allows us to really worry about them. For Frodo, Wood makes us really care about whether or not he will manage to fight off the power of the ring, and Radcliffe lets us see both the adventurous side of Harry, as well as the teenage side wanting to live a normal life. Speelers, on the other hand, cannot ever take Eragon much further than speaking normal lines. When he attempts to show great emotion, it is very difficult to really let yourself be thrown into his character.Although the visuals for the film are quite remarkable (they are the highlight of the film and worthy of an Oscar nomination), many of the other technicalities the film faces are not so successfully handled. Creating costumes for a fantasy world is very difficult to pull off without making them look ridiculous, but Peter Jackson appeared to have no trouble at all accomplishing this. While the simpler clothing (Eragon's peasant clothing) works out fine, much of what you see people wear is enough on its own to make you take your eye off what is happening in the film and stare at these bizarre wardrobes.You would think that when a film is getting a response this weak, I would probably be hoping that it would have been shorter. On the contrary, this one hour, fifty minute picture is greatly harmed by being far too short. What this prevents from happening is allowing any of the scenes to have any depth or true emotion. In ""Lord of the Rings,"" the Battle of Minas Tirith was probably about forty minutes in total. Here, the great climactic battle is no more than ten minutes in length, and because the film ends shortly afterwards, you are left with a great longing to have seen more than what you got. If it had been another thirty or forty minutes longer (and yes, I really mean that much), the pacing could have been much better and allowed the film to cover more than it did, making it a better overall film experience. Although there are many problems with Eragon, ""boring"" is one of the last words I would use to describe it.Summary: Although ""Eragon"" is an entertaining and fun adaptation, it lacks far too much in the areas that count to join the ranks of ""Lord of the Rings"" or ""Star Wars"" as one of the great sagas of our time.Review by Billybob Washere, written for film site www.boxofficefanatic.com",Eragon
124,oaksong,"A butcher job, as much as I wanted to like it.",4,19 December 2006,"It's really sad when something with as much promise as this had is given to a hack writer with less imagination than the writer's of the old 60's Batman series.I wonder if anyone noticed during the dragon battle scene that clearly, at one point, there had been thoughts of creating Tronheim as described in the book, rather than the pitiful dirt pile shown in the rest of the sequence.As a very young author Chris turned out a book with a great deal of insight. Unfortunately little of it was carried over to the screen play. I think with a little more plotting there would have been a clearer presentation presentation of what got young Eragon from being a young farmer to a magic wielding dragon rider.The story clearly was rushed towards the end with no time to explain who any of the characters were. THe changes made to the story line will, as mentioned elsewhere, make it impossible to produce another film, unless this one is flat out ignored, which would not be a bad thing.I understand many of the impulses that led to this typical Hollywood disaster flic, it's a shame they were unable to reign them in.",Eragon

As a fan of the book, this reviewer wanted to love this movie, but it just did not live up to its potential. With all of the hype, you would expect ""Eragon"" to be great, maybe not the level of ""Lord of the Rings,"" ""Harry Potter,"" or ""Chronicles of Narnia,"" but just a notch below those. It is a shame that something so hyped up could be so disappointing. It would more logical to save your $8.75+ and either watch ""Casino Royale"" or spend a little more and buy the book, ""Eragon.""King Galbatorix has slaughtered all the legendary dragons and their riders, driving the rebels into hiding. Luckily, hope still is possible because Princess Arya is able to export the last remaining dragon egg from Galbatorix. This egg ends up in the possession of Eragon. This dragon, named Saphira, has immediately bonded with Eragon. Sadly, this makes Eragon a target for King Galbatorix and his sorcerer henchman, Durza. Eragon soon finds his family under attack. To his luck, a man named Brom is there to rescue him. Brom leads him on a journey that teaches him the ways of dragons and magic. Is Eragon ready to face these dangers?If you enjoyed the book, you will not like this movie. Many of the key characters are nonexistent. Many of the locations were not there either. They even left out some key plots in the book. It almost seems like the screenwriters just skimmed the book, and put only the ""key"" elements. It almost felt like the makers only cared about the buck and not the film itself. It is difficult to fit a whole book into just one movie, but they could have done some modification here and there in order to do that. If you look at recent films like ""Lord of the Rings,"" ""Harry Potter,"" ""Spiderman,"" and ""X-Men"" (before ""The Last Stand"") those movies were not 100% perfect to the book, but there was enough modification for people to not mind.The most bothersome part of this movie was the length. It is a known fact that you cannot make an epic fantasy with a runtime of only 99 minutes long. ""Dumb and Dumber"" was seven minutes longer. What were they thinking making a fantasy movie that was shorter then a buddy comedy? They should have increased the run time by 60 minutes. This reviewer would have no problems sitting through a 150-minute movie and fans of the book would probably not mind either. This proves that they cared more about the number of screening then the quality of the movie.Due to the short runtime, there are many plot holes and very little character development. You have a hard time caring for any of the characters on the screen. Everything seemed rushed when it never needed it to be. Some things were not explained very well. If you had not read the book, you might have been confused. The blame should be going to the screenwriters and the director, Stefen Fangmeier. This is more proof that the makers did not care enough.The acting was mediocre at best. When you have a cast with names like: Jeremy Irons (as Brom), John Malkovich (as King Galbatorix), Djimon Hounsou (as Ajihad), Rachel Weis (as Saphira), and among others, you would expect at least better then average. This reviewer's friend said it best, ""When the actors weren't acting like robots, they were overacting."" All of the blame should be going to the screenwriters because there is no other way you can look at that. The only actors to do a better then mediocre job were Jeremy Irons as Brom and Rachel Weis as the telepathic voice of Saphira.Another problem was the music. A good movie has an amazing film score that draws you into the movie as it were another character. You should not expect ""Lord of the Rings"" quality, but you should at least hope for something that could draw you into the story and make you care a bit more. An Avril Lavigne song, ""Keep Holding On,"" is played at the beginning of the end credits. This reviewer has nothing against Avril, but it makes you wonder what ""20th Century Fox"" was thinking deciding to put a mainstream teenybopper song in a fantasy movie.The movie was not all disappointment. The visuals were amazing, especially Saphira. This Saphira, with the scales and feathers, was a unique dragon to look at. Whenever Saphira and Eragon were in flight, you should be in awe. This is not surprising considering that Industrial Light & Magic (ILM), a visual effects company created by George Lucas, were in charge for all the special effects. Plus when you have a $100 million budgeted fantasy movie, you better expect some great special effects.Overall, this movie was a disappointment. Sure the visuals were amazing and Jeremy Irons and Rachel Weis tried their best to save this movie, but unfortunately the makers did not seem to care about the quality of the film. While reading the book, ""Eragon,"" it was obvious that Christopher Paolini was no JRR Tolkien, it is also clear that Stefen Fangmeier is no Peter Jackson. ""Eragon"" probably would be more enjoyable if you do read the book, but it is extremely doubtful. Skip this title but if you have to see it, wait for the DVD rental.",Eragon

And oh yes, the farm boy becomes a hero in fighting along with the resistance. Why do I suspect that the sorcerer, Durza, will turn out to be Luke's...oops, I mean Eragon's...father in the sequel if there is one.Okay, there were good points. Jeremy Irons did what he could with what he had to work with. I loved the dragon with Rachel Weisz's voice. And of course, there is the great special effects.

It is like the book and the movie have 2 different Story lines, and I am not joking around.The part that most upsets me was when they killed off the Ra'Zac. Okay, you stupid directors and writers, the whole point of Eldest is to catch the Ra'Zac and kill them, THATS THAT WHOLE POINT TO ELDEST. I am praying on my knees right now for there to be no sequel, as it will make the title of Eragon more worse. I must say myself that browsing through all these comments on IMDb, I have not seen one movie on this database that has had so many comments against it, there must be at least 200 of them all saying it was bad with a 1/10 rating, and I will gladly add to this list.",Eragon
128,iamsam103,An above average epic bursting to come out of a below average cheese-athon,4,7 January 2007,"I'm going to point out first of all that I love dragons. I LOVE dragon-slayer and still think it was ahead of it's time! Dragonheart was an amazing experience for me when I was younger, and still now the dragon looks f*ing cool. Reign of Fire was a disappointment, but the dragons were so dam awesome I didn't care....So this is mainly why i watched this film...for the dragon.I have not read the books, in fact the only thing I do know is that the books author, (Christopher Paolini?) wrote them when he was about 15. Now I'm not doubting for one second that the books are good or bad or whatever, to be honest I have next to no interest in the books and just care about the film adaptation. From the second I saw early pictures of Robert Carlyle in his outfit and of our lead hero (which i've already forgotten his name...)I knew this film would turn out to be a flop. I wasn't wrong, every review I've read about this film has slated it and the trailer made me feel queasy into saying ""lord of the rings"" ripoff? Now I shouldn't be saying that at all, because it is unfair to nearly ANY fantasy film that comes out nowadays. You can't immediately compare a new film to the best of fantasy films;it might be a totally different type of fantasy and if your already calling it a LOTR wannabe, then it's already failed in your opinion of sustaining any respect...which should be reserved for AFTER you've seen it.Well i can fairly say, after seeing this film, that it's not just a LOTR rip off, but also a Star Wars rip off as well. The story is basically the same as A New Hope. Farmboy lives with uncle, farm-boy finds something that is dangerous for the King of baddies, King of baddies sends out soldiers to kill him....Farmboy's uncle dies, farm-boy goes off on an adventure under the influence and teaches of an Aragorn wannabe (they even dressed Jeremy iron's character the same as Aragorn!) and he finds himself in the middle of a battle between two forces. My main problem with the film is that, it had so much potential! It was an hour and 40 minutes I think which could quite easily have been two and half hours and been stretched out to make a good film. The pace of the film is horrible, you can tell that the filmmakers are rushing from one set piece to the next to try and usher the film along to the climax to meet under a 2hr mark so that the little kids won't get bored. The acting is around average, Jeremy Iron's, as usual, hams it up and does a good job with material he clearly doesn't seem comfortable with. Sienna Guilroy (spelling?) looks fabulous but she to seems uncomfortable and frustrated with delivering the lines with meaning. The lead actor, (cant remember his name) playing Eragon just wasn't very good, he did an OK job but nothing fantastic or believable, which is needed...it shows just how good it is when you can't remember any of the character's names except for the one which is also the title of the film! I don't know what John Malkovich, Carlyle, Irons, Honsou or even Guillroy were doing here...maybe they felt sorry for the production and took part in it for good faith so it didn't do too badly (this would also explain how Uwe Boll gets good actors, sympathy).Now, the star of the film...the dragon. The visual effects, aren't stunning or breathtaking, but they do the job well into creating a believable dragon. Two things annoyed me though, when the dragon grew up (going from little puppy dragon to full grown just because it learns how to fly) and suddenly being able to communicate to Eargorn through thoughts...the firs time I heard the dragon speak, or ...think to Eragon, and noticed Rachel Weisz's voice...i laughed with embarrassment for the film. It was done so horribly and was so cheesy I couldn't take the film seriously. To be honest though, the dragon probably does give the best performance in the film...but this doesn't make it worthwhile of any special attention. I admire the fact that the dragon is a different design to what we've been given in the past (not just scales but also feathers) and it certainly was cute at the start after hatching...but it wasn't a ""cool"" dragon, if I wanted to own a dragon it would still be Draco from Dragonheart.All in all, the film was a let down and so obviously rushed. If they had taken their time about it, spread out the budget a bit more then the could have come up with a 2 & 1/2 hour something epic that is perfect for kids and not bad for adults. But instead we get an extended teaser trailer for what MIGHT HAVE BEEN a good film. This is silly, unbelievable and sadly...uninteresting hokum which I simply don't care about. The sad thing though, is that if they make the other 2 films...i will probably watch them for three reasons;1. Sienna Guilroy 2. Dragon 3. Hope that Eragon dies.Not a good sign is it? Well here's hoping that the other two films find a new director that shows some talent and a degree of respect for the novels, other than simply rushing ahead to get to fighting and it's disappointing climax.",Eragon
129,laci-5,Unfortunately mediocre,5,13 December 2006,"No, the effects aren't bad; they are simply nothing special (the dragon looks good but the fx quality is not better than 3-4 years ago). No, the acting isn't bad, but it can be seen the director had no real experience in telling the actors what to do. No, the pacing isn't bad, but it simply isn't too interesting. Sorry, Eragon fans, but this movie - differing a bit from the book which it runs through - shows even more clearly that the story is simply a rip-off of Star Wars IV: A New Hope. No, I don't think it would be a problem if it was spectacular enough (e.g. the castles and cities are only 2-second inbetweens; it's like in TV shows when you see actors in studios and for some seconds they show the city/building they are supposed to be in), if it had enough tiny details that could make us amazed and let us forget the way too obvious similarities in the plot. Patrick Doyle's music is dynamic and emotional; too bad the movie is not - and as they just run through the story we really can't feel anything for the characters, we can't even know the world of Algäesia (we can hear there are elves and dwarfs etc., but can't really see or separate them from humans). There is nothing really bad in this movie; but certainly there is nothing memorable. If they want to make a trilogy they should try harder.",Eragon

I have seen both movies, and thought the same of both movies. HOW CAN THIS BE DONE, and WHY, did the author let such trash go by? But i think there is much prejudice as far as authors go. Prisoner of Azkaban movie sucked, BIG TIME, but many comments of people on here and other places, loved it, even though just like Eragon, the movie had much eliminated, changed, rushed , and just shot terribly. How can 2 movies, that were based on books, that were horrible movie representations, have such broad views of movie-goers and fans??But about the movie....It was rushed, the story was sub-par, the acting was very cardboard, and the effects were passable. but at least they wore costumes, and i didn't see many microphones or camera shaking like i did in Azkaban.Hollywood put this together to make money, bottom line. But if they plan on a sequel....I hope they take their time,and actually, work on producing a great film. Hire a better director, lead actor, and writers. Also FOLLOW the book more, and allow ATLEST 2 hours to tell the story. For the book Eldest, i would say 2 hours and 40 minutes would be a good time length.",Eragon

132,james.p.taylor,A failure of a fantasy epic.,3,16 April 2007,"I have to admit that I actually waited for the DVD release before seeing Eragon because of the critical and fan panning the film received.Set in a fantasy land where dragons once ruled the skies, Eragon follows the adventures of a simple farm boy who comes across a mysterious stone in the forest while out hunting one night. Taking it back home the 'stone' hatches and inside is a dragon. The evil king Galbatorix then sends out his 'best' henchmen to kill the boy and is dragon, seeing them as a chance to unite the people against him.This film, although a fantasy, is very much a copy of Star Wars with some minor changes to setting. I now dare anyone to watch the film and not spot Obi Wan, Han Solo and Leia among the characters. I'd very much like to blame the cast for this awful mess, but without good source material and clever directing an awful script will always result in an awful film.The blame for this disaster should be laid squarely with Christopher Paolini. On the special features he says that his original inspiration for writing Eragon was he'd read all the fantasy books in his local library. It shows.This is very much a fantasy lite film. With the massive LotR epics out there and even the marginally good Chronicles of Narnia as competition this film doesn't square up. John Malkovich is massively under used in the film, getting only ten minutes (if that) on screen. If anyone could have saved this it would have been him. Robert Carlyle as Durza does a good job as the sub-bad guy, all evil grins and mad eyes. On the side of good there are bigger problems. Edward Speleers as Eragon is maybe a bit too young to carry this role. Although filmed mainly in order he does start to grow into the role towards the end of the film he is just a bit too naive and 'innocent' to carry it off.A good way to mindlessly pass a Sunday afternoon, don't watch this expecting a masterpiece.",Eragon
133,fred-kolb,"Mediocre adaptation with some strong assets, but is shallow and can't compete with the great classics of the genre",5,22 July 2010,"Let's be honest, ""Lord of the Rings"" ruined the genre forever, simply because the three movies achieved such cinematic perfection that they remain untouchable by any other fantasy book adaptations. ""Eragon"", based on the first book in Christopher Paolini's best-selling trilogy, back then still duology, is not essentially a bad film, but it has too many parallels to ""Lord of the Rings"" and ultimately fails in almost every comparison. Having said that, I really enjoyed the film and it looked fantastic, but again, a fantasy movie these days has to be more than enjoyable to leave its mark.In Alagaesia, there used to be an army of dragon riders until they were all betrayed by a Galbatorix, who drove the dragons into extinction and proclaimed himself king of Alagaesia. But one night, a young farm boy named Eragon discovers a mysterious stone in the woods near his home and decides to take it home. Shortly afterwards, the stone turns out to really be an egg, when a baby dragon hatches from it, and when Eragon touches it for the first time, a mark is left on his hand. The dragon grows up quite quickly, but Galbatorix has become aware that a new dragon has been born and puts the task of killing Eragon on the shade Durza, a dark sorcerer. His forces ravage through the villages killing several people, including Eragon's uncle, and the boy is only saved by Brom, a strange man from the village, who trains Eragon into using his dragon. He wants Eragon to make his way to the Varden, a group of rebels opposing the rule of the king, and in the process him, the boy and the dragon named Saphira, form a close bond of friendship. But Eragon keeps dreaming of a young woman, who is kept prisoner by Durza and against Brom's advise makes his way to the castle with Saphira, but the evil shade has already put out a deadly trap for him.I have to admit that I have never read Paolini's books, but considering they were such bestsellers, I assume that they were a lot better than this movie. Ultimately the film, which is also rather short for a fantasy book adaptation with a running time of just over 100 minutes, feels empty and the plot seems to lead into nowhere. Brom leads Eragon to the Varden, but once he arrives, it never becomes quite clear why he was supposed to go there in the first place. The relationships between the characters felt completely dry, there was no powerful emotion, no history, and essentially the film manages to tell its story but there is no depth in there at all. The script written by Peter Buchman, whose only writing credit was the third installment in the ""Jurassic Park"" series, is not horrible, but full of the typical ""young man leaves his home to become a hero"" clichés, and there are of course the monologues by the mentor about foolishness, responsibility and his deep dark secret that becomes obvious the first time he appears on screen. While the cinematography and landscape shots are not as present as they were in ""Lord of the Rings, they are still quite beautiful and much of the film was shot in Hungary, showing that you don't need to travel all the way to New Zealand to get some fantastic pictures. Patrick Doyle might not be the most well-known composer, but delivers a powerful and epic score, that even gave me goose bumps once, when Eragon sat outside of the farm staring into the far reaching plains of Alagaesia.So, the cast of this film is absolutely top-notch and I was surprised by how many big names were brought together for this fairly mediocre movie. Edward Speleers tries very hard in the title role and he does have the spark of charisma to him that you need to be a hero in a fantasy film. He also reminds me a bit of Simon Baker, who plays Patrick Jane in ""The Mentalist"", and ultimately he gives a good performance that should hopefully get him recognized. Jeremy Irons is stellar as Brom and his robust presence on screen makes the mediocre quality of the lines he says almost irrelevant. Although he is the typical mentor for the protagonist, and his motives and history are relatively transparent, I enjoyed to see him again in one of his rare appearances in movies these days. Sienna Guillory makes a beautiful figure as Arya, but unfortunately her character is a complete mystery and her background is never explained at all. Robert Carlyle gets to pull off his role in the craziest way possible and although his character, the shade Durza, is in no way explained as well, it was a lot of fun to watch his maniacal laugh and his grimaces. John Malkovich was in this film, yes, but he can't have been on screen for more than maybe five minutes, and his lines of dialog are limited to about a dozen. A pity that such a talented performer was wasted in such a way. And then there is Rachel Weisz, who doesn't act, but merely provided the voice for Saphira. Merely, are you kidding? This woman has such a fantastic and haunting voice that she outplays almost all the other actors on screen, which really does not speak for the quality of the characters.Although it in no way reaches the very good representatives of the genre, the film was enjoyable and simple to understand, without the drama and philosophical aspects of ""Lord of the Rings"" or even ""Harry Potter"". The actors are mostly fun to watch, although their characters seem like nutshells without the real prize in. I'm neither surprised it wasn't a big success, nor that no sequel was made, but maybe that would have answered a lot of the questions that came up in this film, but were never answered.",Eragon

135,camelot2302,A complete pile of trash,1,19 December 2006,"I've just come back from the cinema in a daze. After reading the excellent Eragon book, I was really looking forward to seeing it on the big screen. But what I saw bears absolutely no relation to the book.For a start, the casting is all wrong. The casting agent for this movie should be strung up by the ankles. The most awful casting choice was Djimon Hounsou as Ajihad. The costumes he and his Varden wore made them look like they were going to Goldmember's house for a 1970's disco evening.What really riles me is that the movie is totally rushed and complete scenes are completely missed out. Characters from the book are totally discarded in the movie, other characters are placed in totally different scenes just for cinematic effect and the movie invents scenes not in the book. One example of this are John Malkovich's scenes. In the book, Galbatorix hardly appears and hardly utters a word. In the movie, he can hardly keep his mouth shut. Obviously the scenes were invented to give Malkovitch more screen time to keep his actor ego intact.The only casting choice I just about agree with was Robert Carlyle as Durza but even then new scenes were invented for the movie and the scene where Eragon & Durza face off is a total fabrication on the part of the movie director. Brom's death at the hands of Durza was also completely fabricated.But the biggest blunder of all - Eragon appears at the secret city of the Varden, a city built and owned by the Dwarfs - and yet there is NOT ONE SINGLE DWARF IN THE WHOLE MOVIE! I am truly deeply disappointed with this movie which was rushed and botched up in a quick attempt to cash in on the success of the book. I'm hoping that when the trilogy is finished by Paolini that a true fan (like Peter Jackson and the Lord of the Rings) will take a more fonder view of the stories and do a fabulous remake. But I fear that is a long time away.My advice can be summed up like this : if you've read the book, avoid the movie.But hey, George Lucas would be proud of the CGI dragon and the cinematic special effects.",Eragon
136,quantumcat,Fantasy Fast Food Snack: Like watching Paolini's Novel in fast-forward,6,13 May 2007,"I love the Inheritance books, so I naturally was delighted that they were made into a movie, probably to cash in on the door the Lord Of The Rings (by Peter Jackson -yes I mean the LOTR movies!) opened.But somehow they missed the mark, badly. Of course, since LOTR set the standard, it's easily compared and since LOTR was pretty darn good, a unfair comparison. Mostly. There is one big comparison that is important, I will get to it shortly.To me the acting is OK, it felt forced at some points, but it felt that most of the flaws in acting could be traced back to a bad screenplay.What is so bad about this screenplay, this script? (I am not the first one to comment). I can imagine characters will be cut, scenes will be cut... for instance the Tom Bombadil sequence in LOTR. Where Eragon's script goes wrong is that the makes/producers/writers cling onto the 100 minute limit with their lives. In case or LOTR, a nearly 3 hour feature, they have created time to bring the world alive, to have the actors become their characters, to introduce the characters and to actually have them do something, like character building, bond, grow friendships. Not so in Eragon. It's like Paolini's novel in fast-forward. As for a result, the character of Murtagh is magically pulled out of the Hat, the actor is given a few lines that feel blurted out rather than acted and suddenly he's the son of some bad guy and Eragon is the hero of the day. It's like watching David Lynch's Dune all over. There is an attack, Kyle and his mother find shelter at the fremen, he rides a worm, then attack the fortress, win suddenly Kyle is the Messiah (???). ***spoilers ahead*** This happens with all characters. They are barely introduced do something and at the end of the movie you think ... what is Arya ...princess of what? Actually...""WHO"" is she and what is she to Eragon? Who was this Nasuada? (I don't even think she is mentioned by name, I had the subtitles for the hearing impaired on). Brom seems to be an old drunkard/trapper living in the past, suddenly he's an ex-dragon rider, and in the little man-to-man time with Eragon he's grumpy, arrogant but when he dies Eragon mourns him (for the little time the screenplay gives him) like an surrogate father or older brother. This rushed pace leaves no room for the actors to get into character and give the performance needed to capture the audience.I still rate it a six because I had a good evening watching the movie, and I enjoyed it nonetheless, but it feels more like a fantasy fast-food snack than a good old fashion fantasy flick like Conan, Willow, LOTR, the Beastmaster, the Princess Bride and so on.Definitely a missed chance. Shame",Eragon
137,pgear83,Decent enough... if you don't expect too much,7,22 March 2008,"I first saw this film before I read the book and thought that it was a reasonably well done Campbellian-type story. Though not on par with The Lord of the Rings, The Chronicles of Narnia or His Dark Materials (book-wise or film-wise), I still think Eragon is better than any of the Harry Potter movies, which continue to have remarkable success despite their mediocrity.However, once you have read the book, you will be shocked at the amount of material that has been omitted (this movie would have had to have been twice as long as it was to really do the book justice). It is very clear that there were never any serious plans at making the sequel because many essential elements that figure prominently in the book Eldest have been left out altogether, such that it is hard to imagine how the second film could now be made with any coherency.On another note, John Malkovich gives an... interesting performance as Galbatorix (an often mentioned character, but one who does not actually appear in either of the first two books). He speaks in a strange way, emphasizing syllables that you would not expect. It's either brilliant or terrible; I'm honestly not sure.",Eragon
138,knight_armour,Bastardizing Fantasy,6,4 April 2007,"Ever since Lord of the Rings and Harry Potter came to the silver screen, there seems to be no end in sight for fantasy films and books. I for one appreciate it because I would not spend the time reading fat books on fiction. Even so, if the Eragon book is anything like the movie, I'm disappointed. The plot in general is pretty standard. Evil king. Rebels. Hero. Pretty girl. Dragon. And these days, spectacular special effects and CGI. I found the story rather weak. There was nothing quite novel in the way say the first Harry Potter movie was. It lacked imagination and even seemed to jump from scene to scene (barely making it over the cliff, in a manner of speaking). I knew this came from the mind of a 17 year old but am afraid it reeks of that too much. Unless you're a sucker for anything to do with dragons, elves and all that, you may as well just skip this thing. To be honest, I had just watched 'The Prestige' (excellent!) the day before so it set the bar pretty high for this movie. Perhaps if I had watched 'The Last Shark' instead, I would have better things to say about Eragon.",Eragon
139,Booboboo,Cliché fantasy sequences lacking noteworthy acting,1,17 November 2010,"This movie looks and feels like Hollywood, so I guess it was expensive to make. A pity they saved a dime on the two important things with movies: actors and a storyline. This is a sequence of fantasy clichés; of family ties (mother gone, father dead, of course), a princess in need of a hero, good against evil (impossible to miss because of the music and blond vs crazy people) including the broken hero/mentor, and some Lord-of-the-Rings taste of travelling large distances, big armies and orchestrated music. But nothing really happens that moved us, so I won't tell anything about the story. Every single actor appears to regret signing a contract in every single scene, it's really hard to watch. Bought this on DVD for my 14 year old dragon interested cousin. I was in pain after two minutes and she told me later she only wanted to finish watching it because it was a gift. That's a 14 year old living in a room full of dragons!",Eragon
140,LemonLadyR,Struck Out,5,6 October 2015,"My rating (5) is the age this movie would appeal to, which was probably not the only target audience, but I don't think I would have liked this film at that age. Eragon, which is based on a children's book series (but the movie is clearly aimed at fantasy loving adults, also), is a huge disappointment. Just another Hollywood Lord of the Rings ripoff, hoping to cash in on all those billions. But nope, didn't even come close to anything achieved by LOTR. As a Tolkien fan, I was rather annoyed by the frequent line for line and scene for scene copying from LOTR, badly done. It is also mostly a waste of good actors who weren't cast well, utilized to their full potential, or given enough screen time (Djimon Hounsou). I would listen to Jeremy Irons read the phone book, but he is SO miscast here as a mentor/father substitute, which is just not hot how Irons is interesting, esp in this sort of movie. Ditto for Rachel Weitz, a nice voice for the dragon, and she is a great actor; but doing a dragon voice-over with this bad script did her no favors.Production values are not the best (NO excuse with a $100mil budget), with bad choices everywhere. It is a claustrophobic movie, which usually speaks of low budget, esp in a fantasy which relies heavily on effects. We are rarely allowed to see any more in the frame than we possibly have to, except for the beautiful panning shots of Europe and the Canadian Rockies, again, almost frame for frame copying LOTR's same of New Zealand. The dragon is very cheap CGI, which is crazy with this budget. Eragon was made in 2005-06, and this dragon was not up to Jurassic Park's dinos, created 13 yrs earlier. So it just doesn't work, as kids are pretty sophisticated about this stuff now. Not to mention interested adults. The dragon is also very cartoony, which distracts mightily from the story (uh, what story?). Sure, you may say, but they didn't want to scare the kiddies. That is not the point and they would have had to go a long way to do that, esp with Weisz's soothing voice. I just to see a reasonable depiction of a pleasant dragon.There are clear (wishful thinking?), uh, advertisements in the end and under the credits that almost embarrassingly (ka-ching!) scream Eragon 2, but I found the best reasons why there won't be one on Yahoo Answers. To paraphrase, it didn't do well enough on the financial end, so any sequel is not possible, plus very important plot lines were left out that speak to the second book, so that this movie would have to be remade first. Goodness!",Eragon
141,anarresa,For those who DIDN'T read the book,5,22 December 2006,"I didn't read the book, my sister did. She enjoyed it and was excited for the movie, and yes, was upset it didn't follow the book. But I thought (and she did have to agree) it was an above average family movie. The special effects greatly exceeded my expectations, overall better than the Harry Potter, X-Men and Spiderman movies (all those 1 votes should feel a bit ashamed on this point, the dragon alone deserves better.) The storyline and character interactions were a little rushed, but it IS a family movie, and was advertised as such, those never dig deep or shock you with a plot twist. It was understandable for older children (older because it had scary parts) and catered to their shorter attention span, the plot more interesting to young teens, while I think the adults would appreciate the visuals. The group in the theater was varied, and being a week into Eragon's release they were likely more open to a new story, and everyone I overheard left satisfied, no, not gushing (except over that dragon, and some for the ""bad guy""), but pleased, and that's more than so many movies that come to mind. I understand resentment when movies vary from beloved books (my personal disappointment is the TV-movie Earthsea) but if you've never read or don't cling to the book, Eragon is really enjoyable, and I'd recommend it for all ages.",Eragon
142,soneil12,Better,7,12 March 2009,"This is a rare case of a film where I thought the movie version was better than the book. Generally I hate films based on books that modify the story but in this case I didn't mind. I thought the novel was not a bad read but I also thought the novel was hugely overrated and in many regards was a big of a rip off of Tolkien, Feist and other authors (at least more so than the 90% of other unoriginal fantasy novels). While I didn't think the movie was one of the best I've seen I did find it pretty enjoyable and less cliché than the book. If what I've heard is true there won't be any further movies which would be difficult anyway since the movie kinda contradicts things in the later books. For anyone who hasn't read the books it's a decent film. For people who are fans of the book, it departs from the book enough that it might not satisfy. For the people like me (admitedly rare most likely) who thought the book wasn't all it's cracked up to be, give the movie a shot.",Eragon
143,landryt,Very Entertaining,9,15 April 2007,"When you see this film, do not go in expecting the book, go in expecting a fun time.The action isn't very bad at all, the dragon looked really good, i'm an expert at green screen techniques so i could defanitly tell which scenes on the mountains have green screens or not. But don't go in looking for that.This is kind of like lord of the rings,(kinda). The ending fight in this movie reminded me of Helm's deep in ""the Two Towers"". But i would have liked to see an ending sword duel, even though the film has sword fights throughout.Overall i say if you are a huge fan of the book, and wanna see it on the big screen, you're gonna be very angry after seeing this. But, if you go in wanting to see an awesome movie with effects and lots of arrow/sword fights with dragons involved, check this one out.",Eragon
144,keithsealy,Generally a poor movie,3,15 December 2006,"I knew nothing about this book, but am a fantasy reader and movie fan. This movie was a real disappointment, about on with the fantasy miniseries that often show on the Sci-fi channel. Here are my general comments: The CGI was sub-standard. The dragon often looked painted in and the special effects were generally poor. For example, the dragon didn't cast a shadow in one scene. We saw better 10 years ago in Dragonheart.The writing and editing were poor. Some sections of the movie could have been completely removed, including a long section at the beginning involving character we never see again. But, later, the story feels very rushed and there is no time for character or story development.The acting was pretty meager. Jeremy Irons and John Malkovich were clearly just going through the motions. The only bright spot was Robert Carlyle, who's villain was truly threatening.Wait until this one hits DVD, or better yet, cable. Within two years it will be one of those fantasy movies the Sci-fi channel shows on Sunday afternoons.",Eragon
145,charliecheswick,Makes Weekend at Bernies Two look like a masterpiece,1,10 April 2007,"I've never read the book , so I watched this movie with open eyes. And after watching this abomination , I don't think I will make the effort to read the book. The moment Eragons character walked on set I instantly disliked him.(He looked more like someone from a G.A.P advert rather than a farm hand). A good looking ,gormless , perfectly spoken , publicly schooled , county cricket club member, fox hunting type.It just as easily could have been a younger James Hewitt or Harry Enfields ""Tim Nice but Dim"" creation. But , I thought , maybe he will make a fantastic right of passage journey in this film and come out as likable and who has been transformed into an underdog hero. No luck , by the end of this movie I wished that Jeremy Irons had beaten him to a bloody pulp in their earlier training session.This is by far not the worse thing about this movie however , the major flaw is that overall it is really badly put together. It just seems like it is fragments of a greater story , like scenes were cut out of the final edit , maybe they were?? , For instance , Irons says to the young James Hewitt , something along the lines of ""Magic will take a long time to learn as you need to learn the ancient elvish language , blah de blah etc... "" 2 minutes later , Eragon has mastered it , no explanation , nothing , what the hell? Did they omit this scene were he learnt it , or was it just deemed not important. Well it was important , as its little details like this that have viewers thinking , ""what the hell is going on ?"" Characters are also introduced here and there , I barely caught their names or their significance to the overall story. His brother , an uncle, a cousin , some guy who has been following him,the guy from trainspotting, a women on a table, a king. We don't get any insight into there characters , they are just there to fill the screen . To wrap up this farce , John Malchovich gives a performance which has undertones of "" I cant be bothered with this crap man , but I need the paycheck "".",Eragon
146,AloysiusWeasley,Worst Fantasy Film (Probably) EVER,1,30 December 2007,"*******EXTREMELY MILD SPOILERS!********* For starters, I'm a big fan of sci-fi and fantasy, and I usually go out of my way to see movies like this. I let Eragon slip by while it was in theaters, because I found the book to be absolutely dreadful, reading like exactly who had written it: a Lords of the Rings/Star Wars fanboy nerd who sat around in his parents' basement before crapping this out. I still wanted to see the movie, because the special effects looked pretty cool, and it would less of a waste than forcing myself to read the whole book.I never considered the movie could be even WORSE! Seriously, I'm trying to think of what was actually GOOD about this movie, and...well...the baby dragon was kinda cute. And some of the scenery was pretty nice. And...that's all I got.Probably the most horrible thing about this movie was the complete and utter lack of any sort of characterization whatsoever. By the end of the movie, you will hardly be able to remember the names of the characters, much less care about what happens to them.A close second to that is how horribly clichéd this is. I mean, if you've read or even seen LotR, you know what happens. As a matter of fact, if you've seen either one of these, you could make the viewing more enjoyable by MST'ing it and pointing out all the rip-offs. Most especially the hunting horn (BOROMIR!), the battle (HELM's DEEP!), the enemy forces (ORCS!), and a whole bunch of others I'm too apathetic about this movie to list.As for the rest of the flaws? The f/x have their good parts and their bad parts. I actually saw on the Wiki page that a couple sources applauded how great the dragon looked. No, no, it didn't, it looked like GCI trash. From what the fans say, the movie hacked out even larger chunks of book to make the movie than the Harry Potter ones do, and that's REALLY saying something.Honestly, I'm just glad I never bought this movie, and got to view it with friends instead. I haven't heard anything about a (movie) sequel, which surprises me not in the slightest. Basically, if you're looking for a movie to play/practice Mystery Science Theatre on, this one's pretty good. Otherwise, please, don't waste your time!",Eragon
147,dantheman0056,Worst. Movie. Ever? Possibly,1,7 August 2007,"Now dispute the plagiarism that readers of the novel have expressed (mainly Star Wars and Lord of the Rings) if you look at it Eragon has the possibility of at the very least being a medieval action flick with great battle scenes full of magic, warriors, and dragons. Quite frankly it is terrible. The acting was bad and full of cheesy lines (although Racheal Weizz as the voice actress of Saphira plays the role quite well). The battle scenes are cut down to a PG level where they needed to be PG-13. The story is put up as bland and unoriginal on the big screen and needed to be longer to explain the plot. Another huge thing readers of the book will realize they destroyed the plot to an unrecognizable level. The chance of a sequel will be awkward with the unnecessary changes.\ All and All Skip It.And pray for no sequel...",Eragon
148,nsterjo,"Not ""The Lord Of The Rings""",6,18 December 2006,"I haven't read the novel, but I did see the movie. A great story, I would say but the screening leaves much to desire. Actors do a fairly good job, but nothing unforgettable. And yes, Rachel Weisz voicing the dragon was probably the best thing about this movie. I have to say the special effects were great and believable, and the overall directing of the film was good, but the script was poor. Even great actors like the big names in the movie cannot do much with a poor script. Basically, it was a desperate and poor attempt to reach some of ""The Lord Of The Rings"" well deserved glory, but obviously failed. Still enjoyable though. Let's hope the sequel does better.",Eragon
149,gareth-91,really enjoyed this film,8,17 December 2006,"My son and I went to see this film and really enjoyed it. It didn't seem to me like ripping off anything, it's completely unlike star wars or the lord of the rings - so I really don't know what people are wittering about. It was just like itself. We have dog,cats,rodents and fish. now I want a dragon.We enjoyed watching the film unfold, which it did quite fast, but everything was clear and easy to understand. It looks like it's been left ready to do a follow up. I would even consider going to see this again at the cinema, which I do very rarely. Good for all ages. Go with an open mind and just enjoy.",Eragon
150,witthayu,A little bit boring,4,15 December 2006,"I saw Eagon today. Not that I was planning to go to see exactly this movie, but I just took a girl to the cinema, something like a first date thing. Anyway, it kind of reminded me of Lord of the Rings. What I think of it? As you could already see, I rated it with a four. It is pretty boring, the acting could be better probably, well the animations are not really bad, but also they did not blow me away. I think the worst part is when the 'dragonrider' speaks to the dragon. Well, he actually does not speak to the dragon, but they kind of exchange thoughts. It is a bit embarrassing to watch it. But then, maybe the movie is nice for children and for rainy days. If you just see the movie because of Jeremy Irons and John Malkovich you may get disappointed a bit. Their roles actually don't need such good actors. And Edward Speleers? He is the guy who played the hero. Well he kind of looks like Heath Ledger in 'A knights tale' but lacks Heath's charisma. Well, I kind of missed the last five minutes of the movie because I wanted to get something to drink. The girl I was with warned me that it will be over soon and I should stay to see the 'end', but I said to her, ""noo that can't be"" (I did not know that there are various parts), so when I came back it was all over. If you have no other choice or you want to see a very light movie, I recommend 'Eragon'.",Eragon
151,dmbjam29,I Guess Every Young Generation Needs Their Fantasy Franchise,5,12 June 2007,"I have not read the books, but after watching this movie I was rather unimpressed. The story is blatantly similar to Star Wars and Lord of the Rings, let's examine the basic plot, a young boy living with his aunt and uncle who is destined to save the kingdom (uhm, Luke Skywalker anybody.) There is a scene where Eragon's back is facing the screen and watching the sunset. It was so obviously the same scene in ""Star Wars: A New Hope,"" that I couldn't help but cringe. Also Brom (Jeremy Irons) is clearly the equivalence of Ben Kenobi from Star Wars that it distracted from the movie.In addition the fantasy and Medieval theme just screams Lord of the Rings. Durza (Robert Carlyle) is too similar to Sarumon and shares physical attributes with Grima Wormtongue. That right there is the major downfall of the movie, it never differs from these two films and by the end it just looks like a dumbed down version of those movies.The movie was not horrible but I could never personally get into it, I always felt there were barriers, whether it was the blatant influence from other movies, the mind-talking dragon, or watching John Malkovich thinking he was in a Shakespearean play.All in all this is an average movie that is not unwatchable, but surely will only grip the young children who immensely love the books.5 out of 10.",Eragon
152,h-rabbit,A disappointment for lovers of the book,6,30 January 2009,"First of all, I'd like to congratulate Christopher Paolini for being the youngest author to ever grip me throughout a big, fat book. I expected the movie to be a long and descriptive one, reflecting off the novel which was full of dialog and explanations. I think the Eragon movie was still very rushed like Twilight (hated that film) and it has almost nothing to do with the original Eragon storyline. Pinch me if an Eldest movie turns into a good adaptation of the book, because I had my greatest doubts that the story can go by correctly, due to Eragon's differences with its novel.A solid 6 stars for the persistent acting and good special effects Take away 4 stars from 10 due to the rushing of the film and differences from Paolini's book",Eragon
153,AHOLDER-1,Snooze fest.,1,8 March 2018,"When I saw this film in the theater, I fell asleep approx 15 minutes in and woke up at the end of the last shot before the credits rolled. It was that dull and boring.",Eragon
154,chrisrobbins-2,One Of The Best Movies Of The Year!,8,15 December 2006,"And yes, I have read the book. I just got back from seeing Eragon, and I am not at all disappointed. This can catch the eyes from far and from close. The acting I thought was very catchy and extremely good. Do not listen to the negative critics at all, because they must have been high when they saw this movie. And if you are one of them, get laid you losers. This was definitely one of the best movies of the year ( besides Pirates Of The Caribbean, Superman, and Casino Royale ).Acting: Edward Speleers is the new generation of acting. His acting was simply incredible for his first movie which is based on an very popular novel. None should have to ask about Jeremy Irons. His role as Brom was amazing and fit the description. And of course the beautiful and young Sienna Guillory was the best way of describing Arya. She was young, beautiful, a great fighter and an amazing actress. 8/10 CGI: Very convincing. Saphira looked extremely real and very clever. The magic was the way of the century. I loved it. Arya's and Eragon's dreams were very intriguing. And the fight towards the end was spectacular. 9/10Attention Parents: I know that you may have young ones who have either read the book, or seen the previews, but lets be reasonable here. This should not be rated PG. It had extremely frighting moments that could really scare little ones. Durza looks like he was the Devil himself. The king is a merciless killer with a voice that could haunt children's dreams for a time to come. I personally think it should be rated PG-13 For: Intense Fantasy Violence some graphic images and some Frighting and Scary Moments.Overall: Not exactly a movie for the whole family, yet for those who can withstand it, you will not be disappointed in the least. The acting was splendid, CGI was very convincing and it had a lot of depth involved into the story. 8/10 Also Read The Book If You Haven't Already!",Eragon
155,nomercy,Lord of the rings wannabe.,3,20 February 2007,"My children would enjoy it but would still tear it apart. I felt that this was like the Lord of The Rings, except that in this movie the screen writer DID NOT READ THE BOOKS!! C'Moon guys! The bad guys were parody copies of Sauron, Saruman, the wraiths and the Uruks. It is blatantly obvious even to my grandmother that there are huge holes in the story. (and my grandmother is dead). Poor Jeremy Irons. There is only so much even a great actor can do with a dead and rotting horse of a story. The dragon stole the movie. That should tell you everything. This one ranks at about the same level as First Knight and Plan Nine from Outer Space. Too bad, as with many movies, this one had a lot of potential and none of it was realized.",Eragon
156,FlaviusAetius,A laughable affair,2,25 March 2007,"What happens when you take an unoriginal, crappy, but popular book and make it into a movie? An unoriginal, crappy, but popular movie? Yes, yes, and no. Even Paolini's rabid fan-base caught wind of the pungent stench of this heap, and failed to turn it into the blockbuster it was projected to be.Eragon, an unassuming farm-boy, has his world turned upside down the day he receives a dragon egg, making him a Dragon Rider whose destiny is to battle the evil king Galbatorix(played by an epically bored John Malkovich). To Eragon's aid is the tragically wasted Jeremy Irons as Brom, the wise old swordsman who guides him on his adventures.What's wrong with this movie? Where to start.....the acting is stiff and wooden at best, the plot is a hackneyed rip-off of Star Wars, there's absolutely no interest in the characters, the editing is horrible, making the movie feel like a clumsily-taped together montage of disconnected images rather than a single flowing work, and the action scenes are far too quick and amazingly boring. The characters from the book are mere cameos and are confined to only a few lines of dialog before being shoved off the rim of the abyss into obscurity, allowing the Gary Stu hero of the Inheritance series to take his rightful place at the spotlight once more to soak up attention like a malefic sponge.Ed Speelers is ghastly as Eragon, who can't seem to muster emotion even when his uncle dies. (Boo-hoo.) Deus ex Machina riddles every foul hole and rat-infested crevice of this corrupt beast of a film. My friend and I made a running joke of looking at the sky and thanking God whenever one of the Deus ex Machinas reared their ugly heads. There's simply no end to why this movie fails at nearly every fundamental level. When the plot stutters and staggers, some random, arbitrary element is injected into the mix to keep things moving.Example: The epic siege of Farthen Dur ends with Eragon victorious. Pretty much the end of the movie: what do we do now? We have to establish a basis for the sequel! ""LOL! LESSGO TO ELESSMERA!"" Whatever the hell that is.Good things: well, the scenery was beautiful. I don't know where they shot it, but it sure was nice. Of course, there are plenty of far superior movies that show equal-if-not better scenery(coughLordoftheRingscough). The special effects were spotty but were nice in spots. Jeremy Irons is by far the best actor in the movie (Rachel Weisz does an admirable job with voice work as well.) He manages to bring depth to a one-dimensional character, and refuses to go down without a fight even with his limp co-cast and a horrible script. Unlike John Malkovich, who can finally boast he's given a performance as bad as Shadow of the Vampire was good, he refuses to phone his performance in.All in all, Eragon barely counts as a movie. Will there be a sequel? Hopefully not.",Eragon
157,laraemeadows,I waited with baited breath for the climax of this film. Silly me!,2,9 January 2007,"Eragon, directed by Stefen Fangmeier, and written by Peter Buchman, Lawrence Konner, Mark Rosenthal, and Jesse Wigutow, based on the book by Christopher Paolini, is beautifully shot, with fair acting, with wonderful graphics. The scenery, the costumes and makeup are magnificent. All the admirable qualities can't save this film from its unoriginal and tediously familiar script.Brand new actor, Edward Speleers plays Eragon, an unsuspecting farm boy chosen by a dragon to be her rider. Eragon lives in a small village in a time when a mighty king abuses his power. Men are dragged from his village at a certain age and forced to join the army. Soldiers mercilessly torment the people in the village. The villagers aren't even allowed to hunt in the area surrounding their village because it belongs to the king. Eragon was left with his uncle and cousin when his mother abandoned him. Auspiciously, while out hunting one day, Eragon gets his very own dragon egg. The dragon likes Eragon so she decides to hatch and the dragon rider is born. Jeremy Irons, plays Brom, the village wacko Or is he? Brom realizes that Eragon has a dragon. He believes that Eragon and his dragon will turn the tides against King Galbatorix if he can join forces with the Varden, a group of freedom fighters. Brom knows if the king finds out about the dragon he'll kill the dragon and Eragon. He whisks Eragon off, in hopes of protecting him from evil King Galbatorix. On the way you learn how much Brom and Eragon realize all they have in common. Acting as his mentor, Brom nurtures Eragon, teaches him to fight and how to be one with his dragon.Dastardly King Galbatorix once was a dragon rider who protected the people. His thirst for power drove him to turn on the people and he killed the other dragon riders and took the power all for himself. When he realizes that a dragon is born, he turns his attention to killing the dragon and Eragon. Edward Speleers acting is believable, sweet and often endearing. If he had premiered in any of the original plots this movie bases itself on, he might have become a household name. Hopefully his bad decision to start off with Eragon doesn't banish him to bargain bin, straight-to-video flicks.Iron's acting suffers in this film from an unfortunate script. His words often feel contrived and his acting feels forced. I suspect that even the best actors would have a problem keeping their performances believable with a script as cliché as this one. Fangmeier hired veteran actor John Malkovich as the maniacal King Galbatorix. Malkovich's role amounts to nothing more than a bit part. Malkovich's talents are wasted in this film. His face time wouldn't even add up to ten minutes. It's idiotic to have such a great talent and give him so little film time. Malkovich isn't at his best here either, every mannerism was overblown and over acted.Keira Knightley knock off, Sienna Guillory, plays brave and mystical princess Arya. Guillory's acting is malevolent and unbelievable. She is supposed to be flowing, and natural. Instead her acting is herky-jerky and uninspiring. If this is the extent of her acting talent she should play a naked mute statue in the background of a Vin Diesel film.Like everything else in this movie the costumes have an amazing attention to detail, and are disappointingly old hat. Arya's costumes are obviously inspired by the elves in Lord of the Rings and from Native American stereotypes. All of the men's costumes seem to come directly from Lord of the Rings. If imitation is the greatest form of flattery then LotR and Star Wars should be blushing.Eragon was shot in Hungry but it looks like New Zealand. The scenery is stunning. Lush greenery, snowy peaked mountains, and lovely forests are a bewitching and picturesque background for Eragon. The terrain is the most interesting character in the movie and overshadows much of the acting in the film. I waited with baited breath for the climax of this film. I was left to finish myself off because there was no cinematic orgasm. The film at the end of movie didn't wrap anything up for the audience and leaves the sneaking suspicion that there will be a sequel. If you have never seen Lord of the Rings, Harry Potter or Star Wars, Eragon would seem fresh and original. If you took out the beautiful scenery and put it in space, it would be Star Wars. If you kept the scenery and took out the dragon it would be Lord of the Rings. This movie would be great for taking your young teenagers and preteens. There is nothing challenging, nothing offensive, not much of anything. This movie is a perfect C.",Eragon
158,ProphetTenebrae,Eragon - The Cliché Rider!,6,23 December 2006,"There are, in fantasy, certain clichés which over the years have become almost so common that many novels start out almost exactly the same. The following is a vague outline but it might spoil the story, so if you want to see Eragon and be surprised by it's cookie cutter story - don't look at this.Young farmer in insignificant village discovers he is hot stuff when it comes to magic or is the instrument of prophecy (almost always both) and - after some event (which will usually kill all surviving friends and relatives - if he had any... or in some cases just make it seem like he/she/they died) they are forced from the village and onto a dangerous path to try and defeat the evil king/queen/tyrant/demon/jam sandwich. Naturally, they'll start off with - or pick up - some kind of teacher, who will probably die at some point because of young hero's folly. Naturally, the folly will probably be rescuing someone - and the teacher guy will sacrifice himself to save the hero - and then the hero will get away with his ho and vow revenge on the guy that killed his teacher! Naturally, a climactic battle will precipitate them having it out and our hero triumphing...That's pretty much the plot of Eragon - except the guy has a dragon he can talk to with his BRAIN - to be honest, I was sitting there watching this. Ticking boxes for clichés, if the book is anything like the film - I'd just have to laugh because it truly would struggle to be less imaginative. The only thing that really sets it apart is the dragon. The dragon is actually done pretty well - apart from the fact that it seems like a dragon egg will hatch, then go from about the size of a cougar to something about the size of a double decker... uh, due to lightning? That was crazy but apparently, nothing to be surprised at. The dragon DID actually look pretty good, in fact - on the whole - the effects were good. They weren't exactly running riot with the magic use but I think they did it justice.John Malkovich was great - for all the 8 seconds he was on screen, camping it up as the master baddie. Robert Carlisle did a fairly good job too as the equally camp - if somewhat slimier - underling.You're not really getting that much for your money though - only just getting over the 90 minute mark... you'll instantly think to yourself ""this isn't lord of the rings"" and indeed, it doesn't fare well in comparisons. Eragon is clearly a lightweight next to Jeremy Irons, Carlisle and even his dragon... perhaps he could be replaced by CGI in the next film - we'd scarcely notice the difference. That probably isn't helped by the fact he is little more than a walking cliché of fantasy novels. I suppose the real problem is that he totally lacks any seeming motivation. He's not really a driven character and with the exception of a few scenes, it seems that he does little more than let himself get swept along and told what to do - much like Neo in the Matrix. The relationship between Eragon and his ho isn't exactly dynamite either. I've seen Noble gases have better chemistry.There are some interesting concepts... but at the same time, there are contradictions. Magic only comes from dragons? Then how come Robert Carlisle is a magic user, eh? A Shade seems an AWFUL like a lich if you ask me. Also, if finding the resistance was as simple as sending someone into the hills - why didn't Malkovich do it before? It does however, get across the power of a dragon... but that means that the battle scene at the end is sold rather short - don't be expecting the Battle of Helms Deep here, kids. This is the kind of film that the average person could go and watch, find it quite enjoyable and then forget all about... for a fantasy fan - and I suppose some of its clichés are drawn from films too - it's going to act like a bit of a parody. It's always going to come a distant second to the epicness of LotR but then, none of the LotR films were light going. This is far more accessible but it will doubtless pay the price by being swiftly forgot, regardless of sequels.",Eragon

OK, so the acting was a bit messed up in some parts, but wow the effects and Saphira the dragon were both special and breath-taking. If you have read the book, then maybe you will see this movie as a joke, but if you haven't then you might, like me, find it rather extraordinary. It has something to offer to everyone, not to mention a hot young cast, amazing CGI work and cool set visuals. Plus, the ending, when the Saphira dies is quite emotional, and had a lot of my mates weeping into their popcorn lol. So yes, I would recommend Eragon as a good movie, despite a few flaws, and overall I would say Eragon is spectacular.",Eragon
160,themovieclub,A world of fantasy and adventure,8,12 December 2006,"When Christopher Paolini first wrote the book Eragon, he was only 15. This could be a double-edged sword for split votes between those impressed with his talents and those who criticise at the story's immaturity and lack of depth.The name 'Eragon' is probably derived from 'Dragon'. A fantasy about dragons and magic, it traces the adventure of a farm boy Eragon whose destiny is to save an Empire now that he is the sole dragon rider.The main attraction of the movie should be Saphira, a digital dragon voiced by the talented Rachel Weisz. The dragon emotes sensitivity and strength, and is easily the best 'actress' in the movie. Strange.While fantasy novel fans have great expectation for this year-end blockbuster, criticisms have been forthcoming. It has been said to be a copy of Lord of the Rings, with its scenic backdrop, setting and elfish language. (And Elijah Woods and Ian McKellen were originally considered for the roles of Eragon and Brom). The young Eragon avenging the death of his uncle reminds us of Luke Skywalker from Star Wars. And the use of magical spells, dragons scream and similar soundtrack scream ""Harry Potter"".The story-telling is rather straight forward and predictable with a surprisingly short duration (clocking below 2 hours.) My advice is, try not to draw comparisons of it to Lord of the Rings and you will be more forgiving. Note: Arya (Eragon) is not Arwen (LOTR) even though they feel really alike.Enjoy the dragon ride as you move through an entertaining adventure with breathtaking scenery.http://themovieclub.blogspot.com",Eragon

Damsel in distress? Check (but she handled herself pretty well). Really, really bad guy? Two of them, but too little of them in the film.And we can't forget the dragon (although we can easily forget the rest of the characters). She is the true protagonist of this film, the only character with a genuine personality.

I especially liked the Shade's make-up, it helped me forget a bit about the shortcomings of the main character. All in all a solid effort that didn't make me feel like I have wasted my time. I'll have to give it a high rating just to counterbalance those biased low ratings. All those nerds who've rated this movie with 1 have never seen true suckage. If you want to watch a bad fantasy movie, try Dungeons&Dragons 2. And THAT has a higher rating on IMDb than this one.

Not bad for a kid I suppose but come on, realistically I have rarely seen such cliché ridden, shallow, high school poetry-esquire writing. Its funny because I had a group of giggling, talking late middle school/early high school girls sitting next to me. They constantly laughed at the corny lines, and talked (whispering, but still audible) constantly about how bad this movie was. Normally this type of thing would irritate me to no end. However I actually didn't mind in the least. I had exactly ZERO emotional investment in either the characters nor the story and gradually found myself actually joining in.It wasn't just them either (they were just doing it constantly) I mean its a troubling sign for a movie when a character is supposedly delivering a heartfelt emotional line, rather than silence half of the audience is laughing. God there was cheezy dialouge.There were a few mildly cool cgi effects (nothing that any movie couldn't have with a decent budget), but nothing to make me want to ever watch it again.HOWEVER, despite the fact that this movie sucked rotten eggs,and actually made me feel oddly embarrassed for being seen there, it in fact did NOT star a single dancing penguin anywhere.

I can understand their upset, as much of the book's original storyline and prominent characters missing, but the movie in and of itself was enjoyable. Some of the acting was campy, specifically the dramatic flair surrounding the evil mage, but oh well.Fact is, the movie was fun to watch if you watch it as a movie, and not an animated version of the book (and by animated I don't mean cartoon). Edward Speeler's acting won't win any awards but frankly I think he did a better job of his ~first~ acting role than some actors who have been working for years, some of which were in this movie. The special effects were a joy, and this is most definitely a movie that an entire family can watch; it is neither kiddied up nor dressed-down.People seem to enjoy comparing Eragon to movies like Lord of the Rings. No movie will be like Lord of the Rings because no movie ~is~ Lord of the Rings. Comparing movies to one another leads to generic movie traits; enjoy movies for what they are and stop comparing them to each other. Why would you want movies to be similar in the first place? What a bore that would be.If you're a parent and want a fun fantasy movie both you and your kids can enjoy, kind of like Neverending Story but with updated special effects, rent Eragon. If nothing else, it's fun hour and a half with your family.",Eragon

Many inconsistent emotions, and acting that doesn't match the era or time this movie was set to be in. Highly unfortunate, the newcomer lead actor had the face and bravery but yet the two third foolishness was contributed by the screenplay, dialog and editing people who worked their black magic on this movie.

Lord of the Rings was no worse of a movie because the books were better, so why should this movie be? I think the special effects were good, it was entertaining and had enough emotion to keep you interested. The acting, story & score I thought were pretty good, though they could have done with a more convincing lead character. The movie did seem to rush a bit in places and perhaps should have been longer or made into 2 or 3 movies. I enjoyed the movie throughout & thought it well worth watching, but it was nowhere near the quality of Lord of the Rings or Harry Potter, more like a Willow or Dragonheart.

169,TribalWarriorPrincess,Why all the hate?,10,29 December 2006,"Okay, I will start by saying that I liked this movie. My cousin has the book and he let me borrow it. I finished it two days before we went to see the movie, and I will admit that the directors did make mistakes, like making Eragon 17 instead of 15 and frankly, I was quite disappointed with the Urgals. However, it was a very good movie anyway, and it is bound to be thrilling for people who haven't read the book. And to people out there who think that it's a cheap knock-off for Star Wars: A New Hope or Lord of the Rings, it is not. All the elements just go together really well. I also really liked Saphira, not just because she is a dragon, but because she is a very complex character. She can be gentle and majestic at the same time.

170,ashleynwaldron,The CGI dragon was the best actor... What does that tell you?,1,3 January 2012,"I loved the Eragon books. Read the books that were out, and was over-the-top excited when the movie was announced. I left the theater thinking, 'Poor Christopher Paolini... They killed his book, and he'll never get another shot like that'.Yes, it was that bad. And if you really want the full depth of the horror, look at the most common theme in all the reviews. Terrible, abysmal characters. I won't argue between actors/script to say who made it horrible. I'm not familiar enough with any of them to say. But the fact that 90% of people who watched it agreed that the best character was the CGI dragon (with voice props to Rachel Weiz), you might have a bit of a problem. But take a moment for that sentence to sink in. The only redeeming quality was the CGI dragon. The main character, his mentor, all other back up characters... And the only one who gets any mention at all is Weiz, who -I'll admit- manages to bring a good performance to the role even using just her voice (which I think proves my point that she could act her way out of a wet paper bag)They left out at least half of the book plot in the rush to condense a 500+ book into a an hour and a half movie. And the eternal conundrum of books-to-movies...If you enjoyed the book, you won't like the movie because too much is changed, or left out. But if you haven't read the movie, you'll be left grasping for the plot, wondering what's going on. Either way? Lose- lose scenario for movie-goers.The only people who liked this were people who watched Michael Bay films. CGI fans who thought Saphira looked awesome. Which she did. Unfortunately that's not enough to cut it for me. These days, any idiot can come up with decent CGI if time and money are put into it.",Eragon
171,Gagarr,Very disappointing...,5,6 January 2007,"I can understand that the complete content of a book can't be condensed into 2 hours and that many sacrifices have to be made. In Eragon most of the sacrifices were acceptable, such as the elimination of a secondary plot line. But simple things like makeup (elf ears are pointed, dwarfs are short, Urgals have horns) and simple visual effect adjustments (Saphira is a brilliant gem like blue color, not a dullish gray) deviate from the book. If you read the book DO NOT GO TO THIS MOVIE, it will only disappoint. If you haven't read the book, don't expect anything close to Jackson's Lord of the Rings. Eragon is more like ""Dungeons and Dragons"", another flop, surprisingly another Jeremy Irons movie.",Eragon
172,ArchStanton1862,Warning: This Film May Cause Brain Cancer!,3,21 December 2006,"This review contains no spoilers. Suffice to say there is nothing to be spoiled. This movie has no plot. A number of things happen but they don't seem to do so for any particular purpose. The characters have no personalities and occasionally show up or vanish without explanation. One character who I am informed is a major player in the book cannot have more than five lines in the whole movie. Another shows up for less than a minute with no explanation. Any complexities that may be present in the book (Not many apparently) are removed leaving only a jumbled mess.The major selling point of this film is the effects, and here they have a minor success. The dragon is portrayed beautifully. While there's nothing as impressive as Lord of the Rings (You knew I'd have to mention it somewhere) the effects are certainly passable. The final battle is awful and confusing but it does look good. There are even one or two epic looking shots which do credit to the filming location. (Hungary I think) Those are the only good aspects of the movie. Despite the money spent on effects there doesn't seem to have been any spent on costumes and sets. All the sets look alike. As far as I know they might all be the same one dressed differently and with varied lighting. And the costumes seemed scraped together from previous low budget fantasy films. One of the characters seems to be wearing blue jeans and rubber boots and one of my friends swears he saw the Nike symbol. The prosthetics are equally terrible with no really original or engaging villains. The orc equivalents are just painted men, I only know one character is an elf because my friend told me, and the main villain looks different each time he appears. That last one may be intentional but darned if I know why. I know nobody goes to see a movie for the costumes but it really seems slipshod, as if they don't even care and they just want our money.The acting is appalling. I believe I normally like every actor in the movie except for the ones I'd never seen before but everyone seemed to be hamming it up. Robert Carlyle was so bad he wasn't even funny. Jeremy Irons is a personal favorite and he rises above the script to make his character merely mediocre. And John Malcovich makes me laugh every time he opens his mouth. He's not the only one. My personal favorite exchange is this one: ""You are not strong enough to heal him."" The boy looks painfully at the dying character who out of nowhere says ""That's the spirit."" This was said with full dramatic flair like a performance of Shakespeare. I haven't laughed so hard since Borat. I should clarify that I am something of a connoisseur of bad movies. Films that make Ed Wood look professional hold no fear for me and I did enjoy this film for the cheesy dialog and frequent unintentional humor. But it is not for the unpracticed. You have been warned.",Eragon
173,ecko_47,'Eragon' Crashes and Burns,3,21 December 2006,"Anyone remember ""Willow""? In 1988, George Lucas tried to launch another fantasy franchise, this one following an ersatz hobbit (Warwick Davis) who gets sucked into an epic Hero's Journey quest. The movie, directed by Ron Howard, has its charms -- Val Kilmer is hilarious and cool as the rogue swordsman -- but it suffers from too many blatant, connect-the-dots story lifts from ""Lord of the Rings"" and Lucas' own ""Star Wars"" trilogy. Sometimes it's fun, but it never feels fresh.Well, ""Eragon"" is a less-funny ""Willow."" The movie's a mostly dreary adaptation of Christopher Paolini's blockbuster young-adult fantasy novel, published when the author was 19. (He started writing it at 15.) I can't speak to the book, though my stepdaughter assures me it's a very cool read if you're 12. The film, however, is such a Xerox-copy derivative of ""Star Wars"" and ""Lord of the Rings,"" it left me wondering if ""Eragon"" was a best-seller because it had a cool cover, a great title and an unusual author bio.Decide for yourself. Here's the story of ""Eragon,"" with citations.An opening narration (""Lord of the Rings"") says that a great sect of supernatural warriors has been wiped out by an evil king (""Star Wars"").Just before she's captured, a fleeing princess (""Star Wars"") accidentally leaves a supernatural artifact (""Lord of the Rings"") in the care of a blond farm boy named Eragon, who lives with his uncle (""Star Wars"") in a bucolic countryside estate (""Lord of the Rings"").The artifact reveals powers long thought extinct (""Lord of the Rings""): a baby dragon that hatches out of a bright-blue lozenge. The evil king and his evil wizard sidekick (""Star Wars,"" ""Lord of the Rings"") send screeching warriors to hunt down the farm boy (""Lord of the Rings""), killing the boy's uncle in the process (""Star Wars""), which sends Eragon on a quest with an elderly warrior mentor (""Star Wars,"" ""Lord of the Rings"").Aided by the geezer and a rogue sidekick, the farm boy tries to rescue the princess, find a hidden resistance and master long-forgotten magic (""Star Wars""). The climax features a battle with ogre-like warriors trying to take a fortress city (""Lord of the Rings""), intercut with an aerial dogfight in a canyon full of towers (""Star Wars"").Throw in a few young wizard nods to ""Harry Potter,"" and you're good to go. The Tolkien/Lucas shout-outs get so numbingly blatant after a while that you start pining for something more original. ""Krull,"" for instance.Now, of course, Lucas was himself borrowing liberally from myth expert Joseph Campbell, ""The Dambusters"" and Akira Kurosawa's ""The Hidden Fortress."" Tolkien was hip-deep in centuries of mythology, and neither he nor Lucas invented the quest story. But ""Eragon's"" nods go beyond plot to shot-for-shot lifts from Lucas and ""Rings"" director Peter Jackson. If you've been missing Jackson's swooping helicopter shots of people traveling on mountaintops, do I have a movie for you! And a shot of Eragon pining for adventure while staring at a sunset is so ridiculously familiar I half-expected him to see two setting suns.But even that might be forgivable if the movie was funny, charming or in any way exciting.Director Stefen Fangmeier, a well-regarded special-effects man and second-unit director (""Master and Commander,"" ""Galaxy Quest"") does a superb job visualizing the CGI dragon. But Fangmeier is working with a script without a single memorable line and far too many characters and creatures with silly names. The orc stand-ins are called urgals, but if you don't know the book, you keep mishearing dialogue along the lines of ""The Urkels are coming!"" The director also is stuck with good performers -- Jeremy Irons, John Malkovich, Robert Carlyle, Djimon Hounsou -- who look vaguely embarrassed.To be fair, Fangmeier was working with a budget that kept the film from feeling as epic. By the time a pack of fat bald guys with greasy makeup and red contact lenses attack a fortress made largely of wooden poles, it feels like you're watching a Renaissance fair get overrun by pro wrestlers.",Eragon
174,kctotal,Awful from start to finish,2,25 March 2007,"Welcome to cinema hell! Courtesy of the business minded folks at Twentieth Century Fox, we are taken into the fiery depths where this film should rightly be buried for eternity  and I am not willing to be temped to change its already doomed fate.The film begins with the elven princess Arya being chased through the woods by Durza, the shade. In a rash decision she teleports the stone she stole from the king to a young farm boy, Eragon with more brawn than wit. The egg hatches, and out comes a cute blue dragon which eventually becomes a problem due to its increasing size. Meanwhile, an aging old dragon rider lays his eyes on the boy and urges him to join the war against the evil Galbatorix, which has his own pesky old dragon which isn't seen until the last second of the film  honestly! Performance wise, this film is a mess and I just couldn't help but laugh at renowned actors delivering weird lines and prancing around in some very elaborate costumes. The young Ed Speelers is somehow the best of the disgraced lot even though he is still young and inexperienced. Also disgracing the film industry is the respected Jeremy Irons who loses credibility in a role worthy of the rubbish tip. However, the most embarrassing of all has to be John Malkovich who makes the king look like a wacko and delivers the most horrifying lines in history. At one point he states in a matter-of-fact tone, ""I suffer without my stone. Do not prolong my suffering"". Tip to aid him  don't think of supporting any sequels! Another failure is the dragon itself, which despite being digitally spellbinding, the voicing is tear-jerking. How can Rachael Weisz voice a huge and menacing dragon? It is beyond credibility and it ruins the only positive thing in the film. I am already tired of speaking negatively of this film, and yet I have barely started. The film sums up in a mildly interesting battle, but the building blocks are made of foam and they cannot withstand such a huge mass. The film's sets are extremely promising, but they are wasted and so we are left with a heap of trash. The film does not loiter and give importance to detail like Lord of the Rings, but instead, everything is rushed and every minute of the film is there to remind us that this film should be there with the Box of the Banned, where it shall undoubtedly be crowned king of the disgraces.The special effects are undeniably smart, but in this film's case, this is just like giving the ugly duckling a talent for modeling! Or, in other words, they are simply useless. Weta have worked on projects the likes of X-Men 3 and King Kong, but it is also evident that they did not put much thought into a film with no original aspects. Which reminds me, the story is virtually the same as that of the original Star Wars and the concept has obviously been robbed from Lord of the Rings. In fact, frequent comparisons which are made with the latter disgrace it. VerdictDo not by any means be tempted to see it  understood! You have been warned.",Eragon

I haven't read the book(s), but I had the distinct impression that they were skipping and hopping through the story. It's only 1 hour and 39 minutes, so why didn't they flesh it out? Oh, well, maybe in the next movie. But even with it being a bare bones story, it's worth seeing. I loved the dragon. She was beautiful, and Rachel Weis did an excellent job on her voice. You really fall in love with her. And I thought the actor playing Eragon was sweet and had an endearing innocence. Jeremy Irons is always worth watching, and this movie is no exception.

But I really wanted this film to be fun and I wanted to see a good dragon film. I got what I wanted.Ed Speleers does a good job for his first film role. There are moments in there where you wish he'd done it a little better, but compared to the kid who plays Harry Potter, this guy is awesome.Jeremy Irons is THE perfect Brom. His portrayal of the character is a bit different from the book, but there are quite a few lines that the character says that are directly from the book, and he felt so right for the part. I was sad to see him die.Arya is also portrayed a little differently than in the book, being less of a butt hole to Eragon and being a little more flirty with him. However, it doesn't go to far with it.Durza ROCKED! He was so creepy. I was very impressed by that performance, as well as Galbatorix's.The special effects were also amazing. Saphira was awesome! And her as a baby...well...awwww. :) I loved the score to this film. The main theme was cool and I liked how they kept that same theme in every single track. Hopefully, if and when Eldest is made, they'll expand the score int o multiple sub-themes and...well...I enjoyed the score. :) I think the two major flaws that I noticed in the film were that it was way too short for it's on good. It felt more like an outline of Eragon rather than what it should've been. And the second flaw being some of the dialogue was a little wooden in parts. Especially with Eragon and Durza.Either way, this film was far better than the reviews were saying. Go there expecting a fun film, not an epic Lord of the Rings, and you'll enjoy it.

It harbours some of the biggest actors in the business like John Malkovich, Robert Carlyle, and academy award nominee Jeremy Irons, all of whom provide solid performances with the material they were given. The special effects are also magnificent especially the flying scenes with Eragon and Saphira. However nothing else in this movie actually works. First and foremost it is let down by poor writing. Some of the mainstream actors only get two to three lines which limits their ability's immensely. John Malkovich for instance who plays the evil King Galbatorix only has a few lines lines in the whole film,whereas a miscellaneous butcher at the beginning has enough lines to be counted as a main character. . Many of the lines are also clichéd and simple, poor one liners are placed throughout and the humor is too say the least unintelligent and unimaginative. Structure wise Eragon also fails to impress. Many of the scenes bear are striking resemblance to Lord of the Rings, and important aspects about the main character Eragon and Saphira are wrong to what they are in the book.

I was hoping the movie would be better than the book; that it would have been re-molded by the screenwriter and director into a more engaging package. It wasn't.The film looks good: the costumes and armor are beautiful, and the make-up is stellar. The digital dragon works well enough not to be distracting, and the rest of the visual effects are fine. The filmmakers assembled an amazing group of actors; veterans (Jeremy Irons, John Malkovich) and newer faces alike, they all turn in amazing performances. (I would love to see Eragon and Arya in a different story.) But a film is a whole, and individual great performances don't count for much when they're not well-directed in a strong screenplay.If you liked the novel, you will like the movie.

Most of the comments are from people who read the novel in advance before watching the movie. Therefore, I'd like to give you all an input from someone who had no idea what Eragon is about.Story-wise, it has a lot of potentials and could have been filmed much better. As an audience, I feel like the production was rushed and comprised it into only 100 minutes. Take an example from Harry Potter or LOTR, in which the movies are based on novels as well, they have a longer period to let the audience get the feeling of HP or LOTR's worlds. However, Eragon does not have this most essential factor. Thus, the audiences were kicked around and pushed them to follow a ridiculous pace.The fast pace is also affecting the characters' developments. Thus for instance is that Eragon can change from a complete loser into hero in one night. This is a joke and insult for the audience.I'd say the weakest points for Eragon are the main character himself and the retarded-pace.

183,kgdakotafan,The worst!,1,23 June 2007,"This is the worst movie I've ever seen, no exaggeration. It was inexcusably bad. The good cast doesn't make up for the poor development of and between the characters. And don't expect ONE thing from the book to be in the movie, because you will be sorely disappointed. They filled the time of everything they took out with stupid movie one liners like, ""Lucky for you I can't breathe fire yet."" EVERYTHING was wrong, and if I described everything that was wrong with this movie, this summary would have a trillion words. Awful doesn't even begin to describe this movie. This movie is so bad that if you read the book before watching it, your eyes should rot out of their sockets.",Eragon

I absolutely loved the book, and couldn't believe that the film could veer so far off track The acting was average, a lot of the film focused on showing the beautiful mountain scenery when it could have been better spent filling in some of the obvious plot holes and it seemed rushed and amateurish.. I understand there are time limits but valuable information to the film and potential future films was omitted. Even if I hadn't read the book, I still would have found the film very disappointing and lacking tension, character development and reason. If you have seen the film, forget it and go read the book if you haven't already. You will be rewarded.",Eragon
185,anon1mat0,"So very, very sad...",2,16 December 2006,"How to describe a movie based on a lovely book, that could have had a wonderful franchise, but was so hurriedly done, and so poorly directed as to become a horrible flop? First lets say that while the book has some flaws, this movie is really a disservice to it; a more or less complex plot is reduced to its bare elements making it a very predictable ordeal (as any other story would), the photography doesn't reach the standard set by LOTR or HP, becoming quite bland, the casting -while good on the stronger characters (Brom, Durza, Galbatorix)- is really lacking, particularly on critical characters like Murtagh and Arya, and the music -so critical to convey the emotions of the movie- is so corny and clumsily placed that rather than enhance takes away from the experience. So little works on this movie and so many details are ruined using the cheapest tricks, that any sequel would never make it to the big screen (more so when critical plot points were stripped from the movie).Having read and enjoyed the books with my 11 year old son, we had high hopes and were both devastated with this ... thing promoted as a movie.It is indeed a sad, sad adaptation, a proof that some movie execs in its eagerness to make a quick buck have indeed killed what could have been a geese of golden eggs.Hopefully Mr. Fangmeier will go back to do special effects and never return as a movie director. At least I know that I will never see a movie made by him again.",Eragon

But it would have been nice to see a bit more story, and less running from place to place. The choices of which scenes to leave out and which to leave in did nothing to enhance the plot. And don't get me started on the acting - where on earth did they get Edward Speleers anyway?!? The casting would have been better if Garrett Hedlund had been playing Eragon, he had so much more realistic emotion and didn't spend all his time smirking at the camera.

It's a classic dragon and knights movie.... I saw the movie a long time ago...and watched it again recently cause I was told to read the books...So I've watched it again and started to read the books the next day..(Everything was fresh in my mind)Like many said here before me... The books are amazing but it's the first movie adaptation that I see that is COMPLETELY Off track.... It's not the same story at all...Except for some minor basic stuff like the name's in the starting scenario.... Nothing else's the same. BY FAR!.... Arya is human in the movie...but she's an elf in the book. Saphira has feathers in the movie but membrane in the book. Eragon's 17 in the movie but he's 15 in the book. So so much more.... it's impossible to say it all...there's differences in every pages. So if you want to enjoy a nice action fantasy movie..sure watch it. But don't worry if you want to read the book after...it's a total different story...,Eragon
188,plopmasterj,I didn't think it was that bad.,8,17 December 2006,"I walked into the theater yesterday as I went to the 4:15 p.m. show of Eragon. Even though I have heard tons of bad reviews, I wasn't going to let them stop me from enjoying the movie. And I did enjoy the movie, although I have looked on other websites about the book (which I will start reading very soon. I haven't read it yet.), and there are some things that I read about the book that are definitely not in the movie.The acting at times was rather dull and unbelievable, but for the most part it wasn't as bad as I heard it was. That's just my opinion. I loved Rachel Weisz as Saphira. Sometimes I didn't even recognize her voice. I loved her in this movie. She was probably my favorite character in the movie. Ed Speleers as Eragon, I felt, wasn't as bad as people have been saying. Yes, some of the parts that he was in, his acting needed a bit of work, I'll admit that. But give the kid a break, it's his first time as an actor in Hollywood. Obviously he has some talent if he got into this movie. He was after all starring with Jeremy Irons (who was awesome in this movie! He brought some humor into the movie, especially in his scenes with Saphira.) and John Malkovich (did I spell that right?) Carlyle as Durza was great as well. He gave me that spine-tingling sensation every time I saw him. He was a great villain. It's too bad we won't see anymore of him. The make-up was also great. It was so good that a mother who was with her teenage daughter about 2 seats to my left went ""Ewww"" or ""That's disgusting."" Maybe that's just the effects of being a mother dealing with dirty things all the time. Murtagh was another character that I liked. Considering that there was a group of girls in the theater, I thought the moment they saw him they would get all ""Ooooh, he's cute!"" They didn't, thank God. He did a good job of giving you the feeling that maybe he's not to be trusted. I also liked Djimon as Ajihad (did I spell THAT right too?) BIG SPOILER AHEAD!!!! (SKIP THIS PART IF YOU HAVEN'T SEEN THE MOVIE YET!!!) It may disappoint A LOT of fans that he doesn't die in the movie like he was supposed to die. In fact, he doesn't die at all.The special effects on Saphira were really cool. Sometimes I felt like I was really looking at a real dragon. She was beautiful too. And so cute when she was born. She was one of the cutest things I have ever seen. The ra'zacs were a little scary-looking, but not that much. The Urgals were not as scary as I hoped they would be. They didn't exactly give me that sense of danger that you're supposed to feel. Hopefully they will be better in the next movie.The final battle was cool, but a little too short for me. I really feel like they should have done a little something extra. They also should have added a little more content in general. Like with X-men: The Last Stand, I felt like the movie was too short. I sense quite a few deleted scenes for the DVD.All in all, it wasn't as bad as people make it out to be. It's a good popcorn movie to watch when you have nothing else to do. It will also make a good movie to watch when those hot days of summer roll around. I give it an 8 out of 10. And no, I'm not being generous, that is my honest opinion.",Eragon
189,ottfried,"Finding out who you are is one of the great mysteries of life, if not the greatest.",8,9 January 2007,"A great many comments compare the film to the book. I have not read the book, and judging from the comments here I do not doubt it has sparked in as many minds as it has readers - but rarely a movie comes to the heights of The One Reader's inner images. As it should be. So one can wonder why it is that a reader wishes to see another put images to the very strong inner imagery of written and read storytelling - is it a desire for the story to become more ""real"" - with CGI and blue-screens, models and masks? Why IS that - when every strong character and every landscape and every moment of action and pain and love before the inner eye is so compelling that it cries out for more? Isn't exactly this compulsion to feel more what should motivate us in life? Is life of so little value that we cannot bear it when the book ends? Or when the movie deviates from our own vision?I liked the characters I saw. John Malkovich is beginning to seem overrated, growling with arrogance not the role's but his own ... but had no real lines to work with, so he may be excused. Again. In contrast Jeremy Irons' function as tutor and role model fit his words and he filled the character with more than bravado - I would say he re-wrote the role, what ever was in the script, and put it on; a very fitting re-appearance into the dominion of the fantastic for this versatile actor. And the young Eragon, Edward Speelers, was a fitting hero - clean, never dirty, unblemished, heroic, brave, and fashionably foolhardy ... to fit a certain audience. But ...whoever lingers upon trivialities such as performance and SFX misses the point. Every one has a fate. Becoming aware of it, putting it on, living it, paying dues and suffering with it, and learning to respect oneself for what one can do and cannot yet and may never be able to, is the humility that breeds compassion. It can be told in a simple way, like this movie, or it can be told with greater dexterity and complexity and insight into the pains of life and living. But told it must be. For any age. This is who we are, and wish to be.8/10",Eragon
190,twofold420,"wow, they did a remake of star wars!",3,6 September 2007,"It was just like watching Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope all over again, except this time, we have a dragon. The plot is basically the same, stupid farm boy finds out he has special powers in world torn apart by an evil emperor. even the other characters are the same. we have the obi-wan, Leia, Han, Vader, etc. and this was actually based on a book. I hope George Lucas sued the author. what's the next one gonna be called if they make a sequel, ""Eragon Episode 5: John Malkovich Strikes Back""??? Anyway on to the actual movie ""qualities."" This has a lot of great actors to include John Malkovich, Jeremy Irons and Djimon Hounsou. Somehow they all managed to put in career worst performances. The only good acting was from Rachel Weisz, probably because she didn't appear in the movie, just her voice for the dragon. On to music now! The soundtrack was actually good, because if you play it while watching ""Star Wars,"" it will eerily fit like Pink Floyd's 'Dark Side of the Moon' with ""The Wizard of Oz."" Amazing!! Now the effects were good when it concerned the dragons, otherwise they were unimpressive. That is why I gave this movie 3 stars instead of 1. There are a lot of other connections to ""Star Wars"" of course, so even if I write them down, I still won't have to put a spoiler warning, because I wouldn't be giving anything away, unless you never seen ""Star Wars"" of course.",Eragon

I think it is a very well written, very imaginative story and I think that Christopher Paolini is definitely a wonderful author. Why however he would let his brain child be destroyed and quite frankly ruined like this is beyond me. I was so excited to see this movie, I was ready to burst I was so anxious. Then, within 2 minutes, I was more angry than I should be at a movie. I have NEVER walked out on a movie before, NEVER. Not even when I went to go see Blue Chips starring Shaquille O'Neal and Nick Nolte, but I walked out of this movie. I just couldn't take anymore of one of my favorite stories being done such a disservice.John Malcovich's performance was flat, Jeremy Irons was horrible, even Rachel Weisz who I am a pretty big fan of was terrible. The characters that were detailed so well in the book were given no respect what so ever. Angela the herbalist was done very horribly, and of course her were-cat friend Solembum wasn't even IN the movie as I could see since I walked out early, and Joed wasn't even mentioned. The movie's pace was awful, the script was awful, and of course the lead of the movie was cardboard at best. Horst the blacksmith was only referred to briefly and he seemed to only be the village drunk. Bad, bad, BAD adaptation. Paolini should have done like J.K. Rowling has done with the Harry Potter movies, how she has to approve everything first because Paolini's masterpiece was sullied.DO NOT go and see this movie if you are a fan of the series.

193,houseofjames,"Good effects and photography, but loaded with fantasy clichés and dull writing",5,4 February 2008,"Though I think this film is far from terrible, it certainly isn't great. The main fault of this film, an adaptation of Christopher Paolini's equally clichéd fantasy novel, lies in the casting of a very weak lead in the form of Edward Speelers, who is completely devoid of the charisma required for such a character. Jeremy Irons brings his usual conviction to the role of Brom, the wizened dragon-rider, and the luscious Sienna Guillory is gorgeous as the Elf Arya.But when it all comes down to it, this film seems like a smattering of ideas culled from better films (Star Wars, Dragonheart, Lord of the Rings, etc). The effects bringing the dragon alive are uniformly fine, and the photography is impressive, but these are all for naught as they are stuck in a film that gives us no one to root for or care about.

It sports a cast of A list actors that deliver F list performances.The character development, phony brit accents, and hammy over-acting is simply appalling.How on Earth did they get John Malkovich in this movie?

195,Dan-121,Flawed But Technically Accomplished And Entertaining,8,15 December 2006,"First of all, let me say that I have neither read the book nor have I even heard of it until this movie.The plot of this film is pretty derivative. Pacing seems to be a problem. Events seem to conveniently occur to progress the story such as the little dragon turning instantly into a full grown one after taking flight. Maybe that happens in the book but in the film, that feels contrived. There is also very little character development apart from Eragon. All these left me somewhat uninvolved and indifferent to the story. The short running time also works against the movie particularly since this movie is supposed to be the first part of a fantasy series.From a technical viewpoint, the film is outstanding. The computer-generated images are excellent particularly those of the dragon, Saphira. The cinematography is breathtaking and beautiful.The cast is pretty decent. The supporting actors do what they can with the underdeveloped screenplay. Some scenes felt somewhat hammy to me particularly those involving John Malkovich. Suffice to say, many of the notable actors in this movie are underused, particularly John Malkovich. His King Galbatorix character is so one-dimensional, I was thinking people are going to say the acting is terrible. However, it is really the fault of the screenplay. Thankfully, newcomer Edward Speleers is able to carry the film well.The action scenes are well staged. In particular, I found the final battle between Eragon and Durza thrilling. There are also some funny and emotionally resonant scenes particularly those between Eragon and Saphira but these are few and far between.Overall, Eragon is a technically accomplished film but is let-down by an underdeveloped screenplay. I give it an 8/10 because I love fantasy action adventure movies.",Eragon

I am happy to say that my fears did not come to pass - this is not a bad movie at all. It just isn't a GREAT movie. This is probably not the type of movie that people will have as a personal favorite, and watch over and over through the years, as in Star Wars. However, it also doesn't fall at the other end of the extreme. Eragon is somewhere in the middle. If you are out for gore and extreme violence, you won't find it here. If, on the other hand, you are one of the folks who looks forward to just about any movie that features magic, artifacts, supernatural creatures and the like - you will probably enjoy it. If you are a nitpicker, though - someone who sits through a movie and looks for every little thing that isn't perfect, you might not enjoy it that much. You have to have a good suspension of disbelief to enjoy this one. Sure, it could have had much better breadth of characters and plot if it had been another hour long, but then a lot of other folks would have thought it was long winded and boring. You can't please everyone. Overall, a good movie, and one that I will probably pick up on DVD.",Eragon

My first thought as soon as the movie began was...""What is Roran doing going off to war? He's supposed to be trying to marry that girl?"" I had thoughts like this through the entire movie. It was extremely rushed. I was fighting to keep up with what was happening, and the book was fresh in my mind. I had just finished the book 2 days before I saw it in theater. If you have read the book and want to see it, I would forewarn you that you will be making remarks through the whole thing. For example: They never do chase the Ra'zac. They go straight to the Varden. Murtagh has a very...very...small...insignificant role. And Brom dies at the wrong time. There is no fight scene outside the waterfall too. Other than the constant things I've found disappointing, I will add that if you haven't seen the book you should enjoy it. When I saw it in theaters, a few people were like, ""Wow, this is good. I ought to read the book."" I liked the music for the most part. (Enough I bought one of the songs of iTunes) They portrayed Eragon, Saphira, and Brom like I would have imagined. And I can't help, but think that Eragon is the cutest guy for the part. Saphira's graphics were really well done. However, I think I'd have rather seen them work harder on keeping the storyline like it is in the book rather than work on the graphics. I just know if I get a story of mien published, I'd definitely NOT let this director and screenwriter make it. I am a strong believer in following books if you are going to make a movie out of it.

199,tony-howe,"A ""Tesco Value"" Lord of the Rings...",6,13 December 2006,"I went to the premier of this in London. The trailers promised much, but the reality was rather disappointing.The main problem is the original source material. We should congratulate a 15 year old for writing any kind of book really, but it just doesn't hold up well on the screen. For such a basic good vs. evil premise, there are gaping holes in the plot. Where did the stone come from? Who exactly is the main female character? Why have the rebels not been wiped out before all this happens if they're so easy to find and the king is so powerful for example? The characters seem able to cover immense distances in double-quick time which kills any sense of grandeur for the setting, and they have a habit of making miraculous off-screen recoveries from seemingly fatal injuries - as if that kind of human struggle is of no interest to the viewer. The dialogue is clumsy and so is a lot of the delivery - a shame as there are some good actors obviously treading water here, (although Jeremy Irons is good as always), and most of the characters are two-dimensional at best. The main character undergoes an unconvincing transformation from insignificant farm lad to powerful magician in the space of about 10 minutes as well, which adds to the lack of scale the film has - it's as if we are simply chucked from one set piece to another.The special effects are pretty good however, and the final battle scene is undeniably exciting and well executed. Kids will love it I'm sure, but the parents who accompany them will probably be bored and have fond memories of how films like The Dark Crystal did this sort of thing very much better when they were younger.",Eragon

There were some very stupid lines in there.I would also like to point out that the main character was an arrogant, moronic idiot and a lot of the plot focused on his excessive pride and stupidity.However, Rachel Weisz as the voice of Saphira was good.

202,quis89,"Mediocre and generic, yet enjoyable",6,17 September 2007,"I think Eragon is the kind of film that isn't worth seeing in theaters or purchasing, but perhaps worth renting, or borrowing from a friend.I know my little sister (15 yrs old) loved this film and recommended it very highly to me, and I think that if you are in the 12-16 age range, you probably will enjoy this movie more so than somebody older.First of all, the plot of this movie is extremely hackneyed, as is obvious to anybody who has ever seen Star Wars or Lord of the Rings or has read or watched anything in the Fantasy genre ever. It covers just about every cliché in the book. There is no plot turn that you don't expect, and no real surprise throughout the whole movie. However, having said this, I think it was a very enjoyable and entertaining movie even if it isn't very deep.Second, the acting of the main character, Eragon, bugged me. He seemed a bit amateurish and stilted, which makes it more difficult for the viewer to be drawn into this fantasy world created in Eragon. The other actor that really bugged me was John Malkovich - okay, we know he's a good actor, but I don't understand why he was in this movie. His character only said stiff clichéd malevolent one-liners and walked around menacingly. The character almost seemed like it was MEANT to be a stereotype of a fantasy villain. Not to mention his character's name was so awkward and strange that I couldn't remember it throughout the whole film. However, I did think Jeremy Irons and Rachael Weisz did decent performances for the script that was written. It did bring to mind though another terrible fantasy film that Jeremy Irons appeared in - Dungeons and Dragons which also rips off other movies and spews clichés at a hundred a minute, though that film was considerably worse then Eragon.So, all in all my recommendation is to watch this film if you're looking for a little magic, a little sword-fighting, a little adventure and nothing all that deep.",Eragon

But I did find it hard to take quite a few aspects and appreciate them.Some disagree, but giving a fire dragon (even a baby one) the voice of Minnie mouse (Rachel Weiss), just didn't work for me, and I cringed every time I her speak through a fire breathing dragon. The technology affects is just not up to speed on the modern expectations of today, maybe the budget was severely limited. Overall, the dragon, and the relationship between the dragon and Eragon was very much of children's standard. It make the movie a blend of adult and children fantasy, which I found weird. It tried to mix LOTR with the childlikeness of 'Never ending story'. I don't have the benefit of reading the book, which may be a blessing for me, as those who have seem quite offended. But I could tell that lots of characters (John Malkovich), for example, were whisked over and played little part. Gaps in logic and story flow appeared everywhere and I found it hard to make sense of it. Children, which some of the film aims at, won't either, and will enjoy it purely on cinematic effects and surface story line. There was enough in this film that I'd be curious to see the sequel, it was enjoyable enough, but I won't wait with baited breathe.

Many of it's elements are good, I like most of the acting, some of the decorations and locations etc. - they are not brilliant maybe but still quite good. But they wasted it for a really, really stupid, simple and just crappy screenplay that is almost 100% a copy of various elements from fantasy or sci-fi stories, books and films and moreover those copied elements are usually the most recognizable ones from those parent stories, such type everyone remembers even not being a fantasy fan.

I've never read the book(s), though I hear they are much better. The movie is mostly terrible acting on top of worse writing: lines such as ""Let's finish this!"" and ""We can get through this--TOGETHER"" are rather pervasive. The makers spent most of their energy on the CGI dragon. The Eragon character (who has a REALLY clever name, doesn't he? It's almost like...Dragon! Wow!) does little more than look simple and naive and then proceed to do incredibly stupid things in an attempt to be noble. And somehow it works out. I personally would have liked to see him get stepped on by the dragon. The love interest has little lines but apparently was directed to emote via orgasmic squeal from time to time. John Malkovich is actually really funny because you can tell exactly how little he cares about his role or the outcome of the movie. His is the first spoken line in the movie (not counting a really lame voice-over sequence): ""I suffer without my stone."" (you don't need to know what that means, trust me.) It sent me into hysterics. Then it ends with a very very obvious cliffhanger like they actually expected to make enough money off this movie to be able to make a sequel.

206,thebanquet,The best book based movie there is!!!!!!!!!!!!,10,10 January 2007,"When I first heard about the movie Eragon, I immediately ran to a nearby bookstore and bought the original novel and devoured it before going to the theaters to watch the movie,because I thought that the story would be hard to understand given the gap between the book's length and the movie's running time.(I have experienced this while watching Lord of the Rings:The Fellowship of the Ring) While I was disappointed that the movie cut out some important details and characters, I was astonished with the rest of the film.I don't care what other people think. Some of the harsh reviews that other fellow movie fans wrote cited that Eragon is just another copy from Lord of the Rings. I agree that there are characters similar between the two, yet I think that all modern fantasy novels are influenced by The Lord of the Rings. You can see them in many books, including the world wide known Harry Potter series. So why do people not criticize other fantasy novel movies? Yes, I would have to say that the battle scenes are similar, but nowadays every movie is influenced by one another, so you can't blame the special effects department.(some reviews that reporters in my home country argued with this issue)Yet there is one thing that I have to agree with the anti Eragon movie fans. The special effects and costume,scenery, the acting(Edward Speelers does a much better job than most young actors)are superb, but the storyline and characters have shrunk too much from the original novel. It is all to vast to write, but I was most disappointed with that the Twins(the magicians that envies and jeers Eragon when he joins the Varden)were wiped out, as were Katrina(Eragon's cousin Roran's lover),Jormundur(Ajihad's second in command)and Solembum(the were cat that the fortune teller Angela). Where as the Lord of the Rings trilogy had each at least 150minutes of running time, Eragon has less than two hours, too little for a book over 900pages. But as in every movie that is based on a book,running time can't be blamed with. Although I don't like it, I also understand that it is inevitable to cut lots of scenes if you are going to make a novel into a movie. So I think that Eragon is one of the best, if not the best,book based movie there is.",Eragon
207,o_mcguigan,A complete steamer...,1,6 April 2009,"Filmed at a time when the world was a buzz about LOTR, this movie tried to compete by filming at scenic locations, played regular dramatic music, attempted unique costumes and over emphasized dialog. Seriously, crappy stunts, horrific acting, woeful storyline, unoriginal dialog, unoriginal, ridiculous language creation, really budget bad guys and the list goes on and on and on. Please don't inflict Eragon 2 on the world. Big waste of money. If this were released in the early 80's I would have perhaps said mediocre but in this day and age its one for the Kmart crap bin.The days of the riders have not some again. They are long over and I imagine the suggested Eragon 2 release when the movie originally came out was pulled due to awful ratings. Lets face it, the anything that rates in the 5's on IMDb is a strict 'stay away'.",Eragon
208,mlg-t888,Bad doesn't even begin to describe.......,3,28 May 2009,"Instantly infamous, completely inescapable, unrelentlessly unforgivable, let's give it up for Eragon folks! Oh yes, for those of you who are wondering ""Is it really all that bad?"". Let me stop you right there, THIS MOVIE IS THAT BAD. And the most disturbing thing about it is, it wasn't bad because it was unfaithful to the book! It was simply an absolutely terrible excuse for a film.The first of the many film-making atrocities so shamelessly committed by this movie, was making an adaption of the book in the first place. Christopher Paolini's uninspired rip-off of Star Wars, but at least relatively endearing novel never needed a film adaption, it didn't deserve one. A film adaption is bad enough in concept, but adding to this is the fact that it was simply a badly made movie.Every aspect of this movie felt cheap, from the CGI to the armies of what appeared to be around fifty people. Everything from weaponry to sets felt like a downgraded version of previously released fantasy films.The second most obvious flaw, was the terrible casting. It really was obvious from the get-go, I mean Joss Stone? Really? Are you kidding? Among the blatantly miscast was Ed Speleers, a typical, bland, blonde pretty boy who (surprise, surprise) had never been in a movie before! He was cast after being rejected from ""The Chronicles of Narnia"" (thank God). There's nothing worse than making an already bland character even more so.Jeremy Irons just can't seem to get cast in a good fantasy movie can he? He was cast as the old wise jedi... I mean Dragon Rider, Brom, who is consistently fighting the evil Empire led by former Jed... I mean Dragon Rider, Darth Va... I mean Galbatorix (played by John Malcovich). Malcovich's Galbatorix is as generic a bad guy as you can imagine. He's a couch potato who apparently lives in a cave and has his evil Michael Jackson look-alike, Durza (played by Robert Carlyle) carry out his dirty deeds.The rest of the cast is made up of the elf without pointy ears Arya (Sienna Guillory), the ever-bored looking Murtagh (Garett Hedlund), and The dwarf who is not short, King Hrothgar (Gary Lewis). Djimon Hounsou is also in it, being ticketed as one of the primary actors in the film, he, oddly enough got about 4 minutes of screen time, and absolutely no time to add any of his fantastic acting skills to the story. And finally we have Joss Stone, who is horrendously misplaced as a future-seeing witch, she obviously does not have acting skills and doesn't fit her character at all.One of the movies only good aspects was a relatively good soundtrack (aside from a utterly misplaced song by Avril Lavigne). But the soundtrack is not even anything close to saving the rest of the film.For the sake of ending my rant, this movie is just terrible regardless of it's source material and how faithful it was to it.2/10 stars, may God have mercy on all those who subject themselves to this garbage.",Eragon
209,Othy59,Something evil lurks in the world of Alagaesia... perhaps it's that film crew over there!,2,18 December 2006,"The prospect of a movie of Christopher Paolini's book, ""Eragon"" was always an on-going debatable prospect of its ability to wow us fans with its enjoyable (yet not wholly original) story  ""Star Wars"" ring a bell?  grand world and lovable characters. But since its release, and for anyone who has seen it, we should all know now what that answer is. From start to finish, everything about this movie is bad. The characterisation, acting (much of which is unintentionally funny, sad when you think about it), flow of plot and the fact that Eragon is no longer being chased by a marauding army of savage monsters, but a bunch of fat, slap-headed men with bad chompers.At first I could let the likes of a PG certificate slip by, because a certificate doesn't make the quality of the movie (look at ""Raiders of the Lost Ark""). But the prospect of cramming a 528 page novel into 1hr 40 min long movie!? Well that's just bad screen writing and editing in my mind and will make a flat and dull story, which the film has reduced Eragon to. The set's (the less said on the Teirm set the better) are small, non impressive and just plain dull and give no grandiose fantasy feel to them. Moving swiftly onto the actors. Edward Speleers, our cherry-boy to the world of big screen movie acting, tries his best but falls short of the mark as the films protagonist and prodigal you-must-learn-the-ways-of-the-force-Luke Dragon Rider to be. Jeremy Irons' (Brom) talent is wasted here, Sienna Guillory (Arya) is nothing more than a nonsense talking piece of eye candy and the likes of Djimon Hounsou and Robert Carlyle are merely fluttering through their on-screen line recital through out.I could go on and on, but to wrap up this final constructive destruction. But it only takes one part feckless new-time director (Stefen Fangmeier) three parts of a writer with a zest for 'lets get this done and out so I can get my paycheck fast' (Peter Buchman) and one big fat chunk of a viperous studio (Fox) to turn a piece of enjoyable shlock, into a half-hour too short, piece of utter crummy shlock. If you still feel obliged to see it by the time your done reading, go ahead and try and enjoy. But heed my warning first. If any of the cast do not return for the sequel fine non of you (me included) probably will either.",Eragon
210,nikhilvarma89,Beginning of another epic,9,12 December 2006,"I really didn't expect it to be good, but i was wrong, this movie is awesome! It's going to be another trilogy i guess, the acting is top notch, the special effects are amazing and the story overall is so adventurous, entertaining and exciting.Edward speleers has done a great Job considering that it's just his first movie, he has the potential to become a very good actor. The king's role which is played by john is also scary and good.All in all this a great movie to end the year with, having literally everything.9/10",Eragon
211,smashayre,Not too faithful to the book...possibly better but notably condensed...,8,16 December 2006,"I'm going to start off by acknowledging that I'm not an executive plant or any other kind of affiliate or whatever you call them that usually boast about a movie to garner more viewers. Actually I'm relatively new to the world of Eragon or should I say Alagaesia (did I spell that right). I've only recently started reading the b look out of curiosity as to what the story is about. If I were to sum up the odds and ends of what Eragon borrowed from I'd say Star Wars (for the plot base plot of Skywalker er um I mean Eragon), SplinterCell (the whole night vision like spell, though it should be mentioned that it actually allows him to see what his dragon Saphira sees),Lord of the Rings: the fellowship of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring(for the base plot of not being able to trust anyone and the whole grand epic voyage), Lord of the Rings: the Two Towers (for the whole battle within the stronghold), Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone (for the final conflict) and oddly enough Willow(with the emphasis on swordplay against fantasy creatures and one particular scene where a sword is driven into them in a semi-Mad Martigan fashion, oh and the plot of a chosen one who is less than what everyone else expected to fulfill a prophecy). But really I decided to completely ignore all of that and enjoy it for what it was a piece of fictional entertainment. If you can do that you'll be fine. The movie starts differently than the book. In fact you can pretty much kiss a good portion of those original 499 pages this was based on goodbye as they are noticeably either missing, minimized, or altered altogether. No subplot regarding the egg as a mysterious precious stone prior to the dragon's birth here (well aside from Eragon himself at least, and only in about 2 scenes). The whole subplot about his older brother being in love with that one girl and him fearing her father's disapproval? Completely excised. Eragon only shot one arrow in the movie where he shot two in the book before he found the egg. The whole starving family subplot gone he doesn't even get the meat. And his older brother treats his venture into the mountain as something done for fun not out of necessity. Oh and naturally since none of that happened there's no need for him to work off the debt. Can't really blame Hollywood though to their credit they are planning on treating the movie as the first of a trilogy. So what was there then? The emphasis in the movie has shifted towards the darkest material. His adopted father being killed, his relationship with his dragon, King Galbatorix and the Shade trying to find different ways to kill him before he reaches the Varden, there are some light moments near the beginning...not many. I haven't finished the book yet but I love the movie...but that's not to say I'll be buying it on DVD. It's at least worth a rental though.",Eragon
212,tj19,Will be considered the biggest disappointment of the year.,5,16 December 2006,"Eragon will be a huge let down to anyone and everyone over the age of ten. It was embarrassing at times. The writing and direction was completely and utterly awful. But the biggest let-down is that it was nothing like the book, and that is it's major downfall for Eragon's audience. I disliked the book as well, so I wasn't as infuriated and dumbstruck as everyone else in the theatre. Missing Eragon would be a logical and ethical idea. I cannot believe it stooped down this low, it had the A-list actors, it had awesome special effects, and it had dragons, yet it lacked the most important substance for a movie, it's story. The story is nothing like the novel, and it seems the movie was rushed and on fast-forward. However, the effects were great, the acting was decent, and newcomer Ed Speelers wasn't half-bad. Overall, Eragon is a HUGE disappointment to the fans of the novel. See Eragon if you must, but DO NOT get your hopes up.",Eragon
213,vlad-cocoru,it's not the video version of the book!,8,27 December 2006,"I see that most of you guys complain that the filmmakers took some parts of the book and mixed them, but changed most of the details... well, I must say that the movie isn't the video version of the book. It starts from the book's story but it expresses the director's point of view over this story. You would have known and even more, appreciate this, if you were paying attention in the school when learning about artists and what move them to building an expression of their ideas (poems, novels, movies etc). On the other hand, it's true this movie has some scenes that are not the best possible, but all in all it's a funny, interesting movie, that catches your attention on a playful level: when u get out from the movie hall you'll be in a good mood, making fun of some scenes. I recommend you watch this movie, the mark is not fair. The movie is worth the price of the ticket!",Eragon
214,koriandr_star,Fantasy Films are in danger of becoming LOTR wannabes,1,16 December 2006,"I have to say this was horrible and diabolical. Yes it's PG and from a kid's perspective they may enjoy it but you can save yourself time, misery and money in renting classic children/family adventures and purchase dark crystal, Dragonslayer or return to OZ, both well made, intelligent and original at the same time. These films will reward your child with creativity, Eragon doesn't.First off it's not the CGI that's the problem, the dragon and the magic were reasonable well done, no one could hope it would match LOTR standards but the story is empty of character and has no logic, if anything must show the flaw of the book as it is based on it after all.Edward Speleers does his best to play Eragon, in giving him a character but Eragon in the end is nothing more then a pitiful weak country boy with Hollywood styled hair and perfectly white teeth (remarkable considering there's no showers or dentist. The character is rushed a to b while incredibly mastering elvish magic that dragon riders (or he) can somehow suddenly master (It's only explained in two sentences) Which goes on to do healing and unlocking doors which makes you go 'eh?' the development of his character is wasted even more by a pointless five minute friendly fight with his cousin/brother Roran (I say brother/cousin because his relation is only mentioned once and he does nothing else then spar) apparently it's character excuse but in truth it was a cheap way to build emotional grief later on in that Roran has to leave and has to join the army (by force because you know the king wants conscripted recruits because it's...evil) And to add more not also is Roran never seen again but Eragon only has a two minute grief over his slained uncle and never talks about him or thinks of him throughout the film. His uncle is just forgotten.Jeremy Irons does well as brom, the slightly not quite there wise man who under no surprise was a former dragon rider, but the way he is to be in the film is flawed, he appears to be smart but has a smart alec go at the soldiers (who are in black to remind you their EVIL) who could and for some reason don't kill him yet tells eragon not to endanger himself?! And this character also amazingly jumps in to save Eragon from a blade, sacrificing himself, how he followed eragon so closely is never revealed.Arya is a horribly done character, a very typical 'I can fight but I'm a damsel overall and second best to my future husband, I mean ERAGON) while her appearance borders on literal sexual attraction to our hero. While John Malkovich as the 'evil king' was utterly laughable, he stays in one cold place uttering crap about why he should be feared (if he got out more or used that dragon of his at the final battle then just showing he had one then we could buy why he should be a bad guy.If you are looking for elves or dwarfs in the hero ranks then be disappointed, I mean even Arya is apparently an elf but there is no distinctive features of her. The Urgals are just bald big ex soccer hooligans in face paint. There is also a character called a-JIHAD (In caps just to show how lame it is, is it even meant to be an attempt of an Arabic name?) Robert Carlyle as Durza is the most illogical character and the plot hole itself, forget why both the good guys and the bad guys never organise themselves, forget why eragon's dragon thinks it's good to fly through a dense forest, forget that using magic to kill is wrong but incinerating an entire army is fine (does eragon even think Roran was in the invading forces that he destroyed? of course not! We're not to even think about it for their EVIL!) Forget why Durza never calls the local troops garrisoned at the eragon's home to go there and kill the boy, it would be quicker then sending in the 'ninja freaks' Forget it all and consider this. Durza is powerful and set things alight, wood, land, everything except...people? Why? that doesn't make sense, how can we not be set alight by his powers? He has telekinesis, fire, he's hard to killin fact WHY should he even take orders from his king? Why is he not the one in charge? When you realise that and the number of LOTR ripped off screen shots (that are too many to ignore) then you realise just how poor this film is and you'll come to note the other errors as well.Christopher Paolini surely cannot see this as good, for the good of his novel success he must stop the writers from making a sequel otherwise no one would read his books.",Eragon
215,flumpman-1,The Worst Movie of 2006?,2,22 December 2006,"What can I say about this movie to make it sound good? Absolutely nothing! I am a fan of the book and its sequel, Eldest, so as always with any book-to-movie transition I was a little bit dubious about the whole thing - and boy was I right to be!!!!! So, where do i start? How about the script - or lack of! Whoever was responsible for writing the script is obviously a fan of the ""cheesy one liner"" and for some reason felt it necessary to add a whole bunch of awful witty puns into the action and to make the characters appear transparent and just downright ridiculous. And then there is the editing! Whoever put this movie together had obviously lost the plot (of the story and in real life) as nothing blended well together and it just appeared to be a hash job done very quickly to get a Xmas release. Now as for the direction - well, Mr Fangmeir or whatever he is called actually did an OK job and the special effects were pretty good - but that does not make a movie! To me a movie has good characters who you care about, a gripping story and a good flow - sadly, none of this is evident in Eragon and I hate to say it is officially my own personal worst movie of 2006 (I enjoyed Garfield 2 more) so I would avoid it all costs! Had they made this into a 3 hour epic it could have been amazing - but at just over 90 minutes long it really does suck and is an absolute shamble! 1 STAR - although frankly it deserves none!",Eragon
216,Cagney,Not bad but not the book I read,5,26 December 2006,"This movie would have been much more entertaining had I not read the book first. Why do screenwriters think they have to make major changes in a decent book. Are they so egotistical they think they can do better than the original author? If they don't want to tell the story that was written, perhaps they should write their own & not disappoint people who have enjoyed the book. Obviously the book I read & the one read by the people responsible for this movie were two entirely different books.As far as the performances go, the main characters, although miscast, all do decent jobs. Jeremy Irons, for example, while a fine actor is certainly not the image I had of Brom. Some of the acting by the actors in lesser roles, is however, almost laughable, i.e. Djimon Hounsou as Ahijad.And where, by the way, were the elves & dwarfs? It seemed to me that the movie stopped about half-way through the book. Did they run out of money? 90 minutes certainly isn't the length of any ""epic film"" I have ever seen.Overall, I was very disappointed, but I think I would have enjoyed it more, had I not read the book and been looking forward to the movie so much.I'm sure Christopher Paolini is very disappointed. He should talk to Dean Koontz.",Eragon
217,Aldaron,Unashamed plagiarism,1,16 December 2006,"I can't believe this film was made. I'm even more astonished that Lucasfilm has thus-far failed to drag 20th Century Fox into court.This film is, in short, a complete and unashamed copy of ""Star Wars"", from start to finish. Pick anywhere in the film, and you will see it. The farmboy who intercepts an important thing, delivered by a princess escaping the clutches of the evil ruler.

""Derivative"" is far too kind. ""Rip-off"" is closer to the truth.And that's even ignoring a movie so snooze-inducing that it made ""The Phantom Menace"" look like a brilliantly-produced and directed work of cinema art.Do yourself a favour and hold off seeing this at the cinema. The kids will probably love it, but you need to save money by renting it on DVD, and that way you can also go and make coffee in the squirm-inducing scenes of discomfort with 31 year-old Sienna Guillory making doe-eyes at 18-year-old (but 15-looking) Edward Speleers...Actually, no.

I nearly started crying at the end with the words ""Why is this so bad?"" tacked to the back of my mind splurging into my brain every few seconds I couldn't even concentrate on watching it anymore... Mostly because of the many plot holes, the weak actors and the unbelievably cheesy story writing. No character development whatsoever, the boy rises from the status of a stupid farm-boy to a national hero killing ""the mightiest sorcerer"" and at that winning a war almost singlehandedly in what seems to be 3 days... Imagine Frodo defeating the Balrog in Book1 of The Lord of the Rings after he makes it to Bree. I also couldn't help but ask myself who the hell are the Waden (Warden?) and why can't anyone find them if they seem to have near mind-reading abilities or why can't they capture/pay off one of the several thousands of people living there? Why does the hero seem to be ready to go and save the princess from his arch nemesis 2 days after he held a pitchfork in his hands and why did about every character have only about one introductory sentence before they joined up with the group? Oh well... maybe it was just me but I don't think so. This is the only movie that I've actually rated a 1/10 in over 500 titles, for that it can be proud of itself.",Eragon

But after watching this movie, I did want to pick it up at Borders.I thought the dragon was good, I thought Eragon was good, I thought they were all good. And I didn't see any mistakes, but I wasn't really looking for any, I was trying to enjoy the movie.Now, I know this may sound crazy, but I liked this movie better than the Harry Potter movies. But most of those just suck.If you haven't seen this movie, then you have a choice, while a lot of people don't like this movie, there are people who do.

It's a simple movie that narrates a fantasy story about Dragon riders. it's clear that Paolini take inspiration from another fantastic tales, like ""The Lord of the Rings"", however, i think motion picture is most seeming to ""Star Wars"", Dragon Riders are a disappeared order, like in Star Wars, the Jedi order is disappeared too. Both motion pictures look their destiny in one young Boy, with a brave heart, but he needs a training.Obviously, the result doesn't look like a masterpiece nor something seemed. It's just a fantasy-adventure movie, with funny moments; the rest of the movie is saved by Saphira, a very nice dragon design that has more soul that all the human actors. Rachel Weisz's voice is simply melodic and charming, delivering a charismatic personality to Saphira.Eragon has some sequences inspired by another fantasy films, like when Durza orders to the army over his tower, this take looks like when Saruman prepares his uruk-hai army to fight in ""the Two towers"".Despite of this, Enjoy saphira's flying, and some interesting scenes.",Eragon
221,eowyn_in_gondor,The movie strips the book of anything that made the book charming,3,23 March 2007,"My husband had seen this movie without me and he called it ""Mediocre at best."" Having seen it for myself, I am inclined to agree.I read the book - it had some interesting and creative elements in it that made it quite charming. I enjoyed a lot of the backstory. But in the process of turning the story into a movie, they had to sacrifice a lot. A LOT. In fact, as I was watching this movie, I thought to myself, ""This is a lot like Star Wars, except with dragons."" It has all the same elements: A young boy from the middle of nowhere finds his destiny and after the death of his uncle joins an old man on a noble quest to save the princess and join the rebels so they can dethrone the evil emperor. Furthermore, the old man was once a member or an order of supernatural knights and trains the young boy to carry on the glorious tradition thereof, at least until the old man dies, which spurs the young boy to vengeance. They both have lightsabers, too! Zar'Roc in the movie does that cool flame thing. PHhoosh! I thought the special effects were OK. I liked the dragon. They made the CGI version look a lot like the image on the cover of the first book. It was cool to watch her fly around and roar at people on the big screen. I think that was my only favorite part. All-in-all, I think I""ll just buy the DVD of Star Wars instead. It's the same thing, really.",Eragon
222,JulianMHall,Spoiled by the low certificate,6,23 May 2007,"I haven't read the book so my opinion is not tainted by comparison. I'm sure however that as usual the film is not as good.It suffers from the beginning from being a PG (kiddie friendly) rated movie and so a lot of the content will have been dumbed down, which I hate. As another fantasy film it invites direct comparison with Peter Jackson's interpretation of The Lord Of The Rings trilogy. That took some liberties as well which I was not happy with, but overall it was faithful in the main aspects to Tolkien's work.Eragon's special effects were great - Saphira's CGI was very good. Having just read the name I can't help feeling an opportunity was lost by Paolini though - I thought it was Zephyra - which could have been said in their language to be Lady of the Wind. Saphira I suppose is due to her blue colouring. Eragon's vision through her eyes is also a good effect that was not overused to make it gimmicky.The story itself is quite good - on a par with Anne MacCaffrey's Pern novels - which in themselves would make an excellent source for a movie or three. As usual Jeremy Irons play his part superbly - his death scene, quite unexpected actually - was very well done. He reminded me very much of Rutger Hauer's Ettienne Navarre in Lady Hawke. I couldn't help but compare Robert Carlyle's portrayal of Durza with Brad Dourif's Wormtongue. Carlyle of course having the more powerful creature to portray carried it off well. As did John Malkovich, playing yet another borderline psychotic character.On the whole I hope they continue making the rest of the series, but PLEASE. Raise the certificate on the next one!",Eragon
223,Kefka_8203,*Spoilers Ahead* Worse than the book,3,4 January 2007,"Well, I assume my opinions on the book is clear enough. I hated it, and part 2 even more so. Nonetheless they were leagues above Eragon:The Movie.The movie is a bland generic fantasy movie of the kind produced directly to TV/video, think Earthsea or Dragonheart 2.Now, to attack the problems:1: Actors A mix between horribly miscast(Hounso, Guillory), to horrible)Speelers, Stone, Malkovich) with some actors trying to do their part(Irons, Carlyle, Hedlund). Weisz did the best part and her voice was nice to listen to. Malkovich proves that he can't do a slightly less serious role without spitting and overacting, while Speelers was probably the worst young actor I've seen since Dakota Fanning. I'm not quite sure why anyone would say that Speelers do a good job, as he's as painful as getting kicked in soft places.2: Characters. Eragon is a dull character in the books, and in the movie even more so. His ineptitude, which borders on the unbelievable is only surpassed with his annoying habit to try to wriggle out of guilt(Yes Eragon, it was your fault Brom died in the prison. Way to go boyscout. Now take a pill and keep quiet).Brom: At times Irons managed to get the point across that Brom suffered greatly for loosing his dragon, though most of the time it felt as if he was just trying to play an over-aged Aragon.Murtagh: Ugh, Legolas with black hair.Galbatorix: As over the top as Cyrus the Whyrus from Con Air. The finishing sequence when he most likely cut off some flesh from his dragon's snout was fun.Durza: Quite an improvement over the book. Here he's just mean and disgustingly powerful. His little pet was nice though, and Carlyle is a great actor.Arya: Dull, and quite more foppish.3: Effects and script. All money from the budget were put in three things: Saphira as a baby(the cutest thing on screen in a long time), Durza's minion and hiring some ex A-grade actors. Saphira as an adult just looked odd, and I almost laughed every time the Urgals entered the stage. These are the orc-wannabees? THey're ugly over-aged men that got kicked out of Power Rangers. The bug-thingys were annoying as well, as they moved like a Putty from Power Rangers and seemed as terrifying as a retarded piece of rock. Durza's magic was mostly the type you expect to find in shows like Sinbad or Mystical Warriors. And elves have no pointy ears, look identical to humans. Oh, and dwarfs are about as tall as humans(as I assume the Scottish-speaking rebel was supposed to be a dwarf.) The lines were mostly awful, with some standing out like nails driven into you eyes. ""Up in the sky, to live or die!"". Sounds like a really bad power metal song. Speelers and the producers of the movie should be whipped for that. ""Angela has not asked for money"" Why in the name of *Insert god of choice* does she refer to herself in third person? Why does she have a shower curtain made of left-over pieces of tinfoil on her? Which moron thought it would be a good idea to allow a fantasy character to have a stainless steel piercing? She looks like a college drop-out.4: Misc stuff. The battle at the end was about as well-made as the battle of a 14 year old Swedish music video, IE: Bad. Alagesia seems to be a Europe-style nation, with many peasant villages(or so I assume, as we see two villages), then why, pray tell, are most of the rebels either dark-skinned or of what seems desert nomad descent? Tourist rebels?All in all; Go rent LOTR, or Dragonheart, or Willow. It'll be money well spent compared to this piece of crap.",Eragon

Poorly crafted, poorly edited, poorly characterised.Couldn't tell the difference between an elf and dwarf, not that we actually had the time to see any.One of the worst films not only of this century, but last as well.Pathetic really, because it looked like with a better skilled director and someone other than a monkey on the editing, it could have been so much more.Did I add predictable? Haven't read the books, but I am willing to bet Jeremy Irons comes back from the grave.. after all the dragon sealed him hans solo style.Even a scene stolen director out of Star Wars... the one where Darth kills the old commander of the ship and promotes the next in command.Unoriginal and if Lucas doesn't sue, I am sure the makers of Dragonheart have a shot.In the end you are left asking why did I even bother.",Eragon
225,camuc,One of the worst ever fantasy movies i've seen,1,29 December 2006,"Let's say i've seen the Italian version of the movies, so this comment might be influenced by the awful dubbing that has been made in my country. I've read the book before going o see the movie and i can say they have really nothing in common. While Paolini (book's writer) made a good job in telling about how the main character and the dragon grew up, in the movie they seem to be born to make war and fight. This is unreal (like in Narnia) and leaves a sense of unsatisfaction at the end of the movie. The story has completely been turned upside down. There aren't some characters who should be there (the twin mages of the Varde, Roran girlfriend etc...) to explain a sequel and sometimes the storyline itself is totally inconsistent.This movie must be considered at the same level of D&D (awful 100%) apart from some nice Computer Graphics nicely used to create Saphira.One last word on the Italian dubbing. Saphira's voice seems to have been recorded after some kind of Alcoholic Party. There is no intonation at all and i've heard that it has been done by a non-professional dubber. Brom's voice is completely wrong. Eragon's dubber is awful and doesn't convey any kind of feeling to the audience.",Eragon
226,wadetalon,What happened to the story?,5,18 December 2006,"I brought my eight year old son to see this movie at the weekend, Now I'm sorry to say that neither him nor myself had read the books (Eragon, Eldest). What we saw entertained us to a certain point so much so that my son asked could we go to the local book store and buy the two books. Which of course we did I got two box sets of the first two books of this trilogy.And I have to say compared to the books the film is a terrible excuse for an adaption.My son began to read eldest (figuring he had just seen the story of the first book on the big screen) and was confused straight away by the absence of numerous characters from the book and the fact the ending in the film is COMPLETELY DIFFERENT! than that of the book. So he went back and started to read Eragon and continued to read it most of the weekend . Myself I finished it yesterday and was blown away by a great book full of wondrous characters, Which I believe the film greatly lacked (Im hoping for a directors cut of some sort to pop up on DVD in about 6 months with maybe a glimpse of some of the original plot lines put back in). I am now reading Eldest and i find it hard to believe that if a sequel is made it will have very little to do with its literary counter-part.Hollywood needs to learn to take into consideration the army of fans this story has out there and the fact that this movie only resembles the books in basic plot points and vague reflections of its original characters (Jeremy Irons is the exception to this i was brilliant in my opinion).Even my eight year old son was was baffled why characters were left out of the tale and why the story its self needed to be changed after he had finished reading about ten chapters he turned to me and asked ""Why didn't the man who made Lord of the Rings make this Daddy ?...then it would have been so much better""....out of the mouths of babes.",Eragon

They were incredibly well written, with a good plot line, and... well, almost everything about the books were excellent. So I was EXTREMELY excited to go out and watch the movie... And I got the disappointment of a life time. Firstly, this movie should have been longer. I don't care about 'the time limits placed' or whatever. Certain things in the movie should have been played out, as they are in the book. Things that are important to the plot were just hurried along, or completely left out. Secondly, while I loved the actors they got to play the characters, and thought they were perfect for the part, I was quite disappointed that they left out several key elements to the book. Over all, this movie was a huge disappointment, and a discredit to Christopher Paolini's writing. The writers for this movie tore apart a good book, and gave it a crappy plot, bad dialog, and a rushed feeling to the whole thing. Very disappointing. I seriously hope that they don't do a sequel, and ruin Eldest for me as well. So to any fans of the books, a quick word of advice: STAY FAR AWAY FROM THE MOVIE!!",Eragon
228,CroatianSensation1975,Decent fantasy film.,6,25 February 2007,"I feel sorry for this film and any other film in this genre. After the huge success of ""The Lord of the Rings"" trilogy, it is very hard not to compare. After it is all said and done, ""Eragon"" is not a bad stab at a fantasy film, it just lacks the magic of other films of the genre.Eragon is a young farm boy. After finding a strange stone, which turns out to be a dragon egg, Eragon finds out that his fate in life is to be a dragon rider. With the help of Brom (played by Jeremy Irons), young Eragon sets on his journey.Let me first say that the special effects in this film are fantastic. The dragon, Saphira, looks stunning. I wish more could be said for the story. After watching this film, I found too many similarities to the story of the original Star Wars. I know this is based on a book, but I have never read it, so I can not compare the story in the book to that of this screenplay.The cast is decent enough. We have Jeremy Irons, who is always a great actor, and John Malkovich, who unfortunately did not get enough screen time. Hopefully, if they make a sequel, his character will have more screen time. We also have Robert Carlyle, another great actor, whom I did not even recognize in the film at first. Carlyle does a great job as the evil wizard Durza.All in all, the film is not as bad as many people here state. I actually enjoyed the film, but the story is not very original. I heard there are other books in the series, hopefully, if they get turned into films, that the story is better. Unfortunately this film did not make me want to go out and read the books, as other films have.If you are a fan of the fantasy genre, definitely take a look. It's not as bad as people say, but it could have definitely been better.6/10",Eragon
229,pmose,erm... why?,1,24 December 2007,"I rented this movie knowing it would be mediocre. I'd seen the cheesy trailer, read some reviews and thought knew what I was in for. But man, this poor excuse for a fantasy movie was a LOT worse than I could ever imagine! SPOILERS (really? Don't we all know what's going to happen?)In short: blond chubby yet poor starving farmboy Frodo (sorry, Aragorn...no, damn, Eragon!) finds The One Ring (erm... The One Egg), becomes friends with puppydog dragonbaby, receives a cool but painful scar (coughHarrypottercough) and then learns about his !!DESTINY!! from a wise ol' wizard named Gand... Brom (how's that for a cool name LOL). He sets out to fight The Dark Evil Naughty Lord of Darkness (named Galbawhateverix and coming in the disguise of half-sleeping John Malkovich) and his Evil Sidekick Wizard Sarum-... Durza (Dungza? No, Durza. Or: Robert Carlyle horribly overacting while trying to look menacing in a silly wig). Durza hasn't got a proper Nazgul but rides a cloud (??) with teeth, probably because the entire CGI-budget went to the dragon. Of course he is assisted by some home-grown Uruk-hai, a very uncool bunch of growling extra's named Urkles or something (I forgot, it was too ridiculous). Together the Dragon Rider/Ringbearer/Boy Who Lived and his wise wizard mentor (Mr. Irons, probably in serious need of money at the time) ride/fly out to fight Evil Lordy and...well, you know the drill. There's probably an epic battle at the end and Good overcomes Evil and Boy gets to kiss Girl (yes, there's a girl too), but I can't say I made it that far.Oh yes, and there's a dragon with a high-pitched girly voice yet when she growls sounds very manly (Sean Connery, anyone?). 1.5 hours of my life that are never coming back.

230,blackacid,Oh Dear...,1,4 April 2009,"I always thought the trailer had something lacking so I avoided watching Eragon at the cinema and opted to watch it on a movie channel instead.After LOTR set a standard for this genre I didn't expect it to be amazing but I didn't expect Eragon to be so awful either.How can anyone take such solid performers as John Malkovic, Robert Carlysle and Jeremy Irons and make them look so hammy? The script is weak, the climax is tepid, the imagery is recycled yet substandard as the film bumbles clumsily from plot devise to predictable plot devise.The photography attempts but fails to capture the grandeur of a certain scenes rendering the climatic or dramatic shots almost laughable and the editing is clumsy rather than lingering and flowing from one scene to a next.And how about the 'instant talking dragon?' One minute it's a squeaking baby but just add a couple of flashes, and TADAAA! She's fully grown with all the wit, wisdom and knowledge of the universe.I know this is a film about magic and therefore we should suspend some disbelief but magical films only work with measured plot development and some due care and attention, but Eragon looks like it was served up by a fast-food outlet.... I would be very surprised if any of the aforementioned actors reprised their roles in a sequel.",Eragon
231,lwalsh,What Eragon reveals about fantasy that works,6,3 January 2007,"Eragon is formulaic but fun, a sort of 'Lord of the Rings meets Star Wars'-- yet it could have been a great deal better, and its comparative lack of success is actually more revealing about what makes good films work than many far better films. Any film, regardless of its genre, is trying to get the audience to see things on its (the film's) own terms. The best films succeed in doing this, getting us to believe, or at least accept, things which may, taken objectively, be quite nonsensical: consider, for example, Casablanca, with its bogus letters of transit which cannot be canceled, or Gone With the Wind, with its ludicrous portrayal of the antebellum South. Fantasy films need to work doubly hard in this regard, as few in their audience are likely to believe in dragons or magic.So how is this conviction achieved? In large part, it is reached because everybody involved in the film takes it seriously. They may not believe the goings-on, but they act, whether on or off screen, as if they do. Assuming a certain level of technical competence in the production, the film becomes believable because we never catch anybody out of character (and sometimes even technical flaws can't sink a really good performer; think of Bela Lugosi's ability to rise above his often wretched material on the strength of utterly committed performances). This doesn't mean that a film which everyone takes seriously is flawless, but rather that we accept the flaws and dismiss them, or make allowances, because the surrounding material is so well presented.Now turn to Eragon. Technically the film is superb; the dragon is consistently believable, and the sets and costumes have a gritty air which makes them quite plausible. But after that the film suddenly becomes very uneven, and not for budgetary reasons. A central problem is that the performances are all over the map. Jeremy Irons is understated but solid, because his quietness reflects his character's past, whereas Edward Speleers, the putative hero, never overcomes his own understatedness to really convince us he's a great hero (he's a bit like Mark Hamill in Star Wars in this regard). Robert Carlyle, as Durza the main villain, almost steals the show, especially since John Malkovich, the ostensible center of power, might as well have been sleeping as he read his lines. Rachel Weisz, the voice of the dragon, is excellent; Sienna Guillory, as the Princess Leia figure, is adequate. In other words, there appears to have been no attempt on the part of director Stefen Fangmeier to create a consistent level of performance or interaction, thus allowing it to appear that each member of the cast was largely on their own.This problem is exacerbated by the screenplay, which seems rather a series of linked episodes than a coherent whole. It may be argued that this is because Peter Buchman chose to take the novel seriously-- but this means that he did not take the film itself seriously as a film; a film is not, and cannot be, a novel, and simply trying to cram in as many plot details from the book as possible will never do justice either to the book or to the possibilities of cinema. It is also quite derivative-- but since very few stories are truly original, this need not have been the problem it becomes.But the worst problem is purely the director's fault. Much of Eragon looks like material drawn directly from previous fantasy films, and after a while we begin to get the feeling that this is simply an exercise in cadging a few dollars from an audience taken for granted. Nowhere is this more evident than in the end; after a considerable amount of time during which Peter Doyle's score (itself already rather derivative) has been doing its best to evoke a sense of magic and mystery and power we reach the credits, ready for a lengthy symphonic summation of what we've seen and heard. But no-- what we get instead is an utterly trivial pop tune, of no significance, no resonance, and no value. It's as if the director simply stopped caring after the last day of shooting, and it erases most of what little otherworldliness the film had managed to create.Imagine Eragon, even with the script exactly as it is, with performances as consistent, and as good, as those in Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone. Would it have been as good as the latter? No-- but it would have been much better than it is. Imagine Eragon with a score as consistent, and as consistently used, as John Williams's for Star Wars. Would it have been as good as the latter? No-- but it would have been better than it is. Imagine Eragon with the courage to take the extra half hour or 45 minutes to develop its characters in the manner of Lord of the Rings. Would it have been as good as the latter? No-- but it would have been much better than it is. Now imagine Eragon with all of these consistent improvements.In short, Eragon had the potential, only slightly beyond its own boundaries, to be a vastly better film. That it was not is disappointing, but it's also very informative to those who care about what actually makes a film good, or even great, instead of formulaic but fun.",Eragon

The protagonist's decision to waver from their original course was a let down. Then, nobody feels like holding him at fault for all the negative consequences he caused.

I mean, John Malkovich, Jeremy Irons, Robert Carlyle? What could go wrong here? Well, apparently, a lot. The script is very poor, full of clichés, the story is below average... the best cast in the world couldn't save this movie. Not to mention that John Malkovich appears about 4 times or so and has maybe just as many lines to speak, Jeremy Irons' character dies about halfway through the movie and Robert Carlyle barely opens his mouth other than to give growls and laughters. I'm not saying any of their acting was bad or anything, but with so little chances to do anything, with such a poorly written script there wasn't much they could do. I liked the special effects. Nothing sensational, but just enough to make the images believable. The baby dragon looks cute. But some things... I don't know. The dragon vision, which looked like some 1st person shooter night vision ability, that only added to the whole sub-par feeling of the movie. I'll give it a 5, 'cause I didn't consider my day at the theater a total loss, but I definitely wouldn't recommend it.",Eragon

I didn't know what to expect and had only seen the trailer beforehand and was impressed with the great cast. Plus I hadn't read the book so went in with a pretty fresh palate without any expectation.Thoroughly enjoyed it. The CGI for the dragon was very well done and very convincing. It would have been easy for the graphics to spoil the movie but in this case, it didn't.The action sequences were exciting and well put together. One would expect a movie like this to lack some sort of feeling or emotion but it achieved the goal of making you feel for the characters.Another strong point of the movie was the breathtaking scenery and the way it was shot was something to behold. The best way to see this movie is in a big cinema with a big screen. Actually, an IMAX version of it would be awesome! The only downside (hence the 9 stars) was some of the voice work done by for the dragon and perhaps that was due to the script being a little bit off (and at moments, cheesy). But that didn't really ruin the whole feel.I recommend it not only to people who like fantasy but also to those who just like to get lost in a movie. It flows well and there aren't too many moments to get bored in. Plus, people who haven't read the book won't lose out.",Eragon

What could have been escapism is not.,2,15 December 2006,"There have already been written plenty of warnings already, but in an effort to balance those surprising blurbs that for some reason commend the film I think I'll add my two angry cents anyway.This is the sort of film that, were to you to watch it in the company of a little kid, you would have to struggle not to point out all the (much better) sources from whence young Paolini has culled his subject matter. ""That's from Star Wars and that one's from Tolkien"", you'd want to say - hastening to add that in the older works there was a grand sense of adventure, of destiny, of storytelling. Not so here... The elements are simply crammed into a sketchy narrative as if they are are merely working their way down a checklist. Old wise master? Check! Princess rescue? Check? Grand battle? Well, sort of...Sadly, neither the actors (with the exception of Jeremy Irons) nor the effects help make it interesting. This must be John Malkovich's lamest role to date. Young Speelers plays the young hero as though his only objective is not to overact. The dragon looks OK, no more. Frankly, the fact that the writer of the novel is very young seems much less impressive once you actually meet the world he has created - if that is the word. Most kids on a diet of classic and contemporary escapism could write this.Apart from the strangely lustful look in Sienna Guillory's eyes, there is little to entertain you here.

More than half of the book was left out of the movie with a cheap hour and a half of screen time.

No need to worry about spoiling anything, because this is not the book and you've seen this one before. This is an attempt to recreate Star Wars with dragons and not a successful one.One of the strengths of the book is the character development of the main character, but here he transitions from a farm boy to super hero as fast as you can say Luke Skywalker. The difference is that Luke is already an accomplished pilot when the story begins while Eragon can't even hunt, read or fight. Of course, within a few over edited minutes, Eragon could use a cape and save mankind. His mentor, not named Obie Wan, isn't sure Eragon has the force (dragon rider) within him even though he himself was quite a ""Jedi"" before his dragon was killed when the empire triumphed.

The acting , especially the lead, is wooden. Some of the lines were incredibly corny. The action scenes were small scale and nothing even close to even the smallest action scenes from LOTR. Im sorry to have to raise that movie, but any director making fantasy films has to be aware that that is now the movie by which all other fantasy movies will now be benchmarked.

The plot, cast, costumes, etc. - everything is totally awful. To give this one a B-rating would be a blatant injustice to the movies in that category. Rather, it deserves a category of its own, one I'd like to call F-Movie, if you catch my drift. Compared to this, Dragonheart is a masterpiece. I'd like to comment on some of the more striking scenes: First of all - a female dragon? What's she/it supposed to do - nag the opponents to death, or is it some kind of (very) twisted love story? Then there is King Galbatorix(so where's Asterix, anyway)who's supposed to be the archenemy, but who doesn't leave his castle/cave even once, so maybe he's a vampire? Also, he doesn't seem to have any powers at all. So what's the secret of his leadership - free dental insurance? And what about Brom's sword, the one Eragon uses to kill Durza? I thought it was something like Excalibur, but apparently it was no more magical than the sticks they were fighting with near the river (which is about the only swordfighting scene). Then you have Eragon's healing powers (is he a warrior or a nurse?) - so what's up with the glowing hands - does he have a freakin' Goa'uld in the family tree, or what? But the best scene by far is when Eragon is determined to save Arya - which essentially means walking right into a trap, throwing away thousands of years of resistance and endangering the lives of the little partisans. All this because he had a hard-on after he saw a sleasy slut in a wet dream? How f..... up is that? So please, don't waste your time and money on this one.",Eragon

The only character who wasn't one dimensional was Arya, the elf. Sad that even the main character was cast into her shadow. And, while I don't think Ed Speelers was bad in the movie, the casting director should hang himself for hiring a boy stuck in the maze of puberty. Throughout the film, Eragon's voice constantly cracked, I think due to his still-developing vocal cords.

Before the film started, there was a trailer of Eragon the game which included a voice over saying, ""Who you think is your greatest enemy, is actually your greatest ally."" I quickly realised this referred to the dragons. I was very inspired.Within the first few minutes, I was already fascinated by what I was seeing. I hoped Arya would escape with the blue stone and was relieved when she sent it away by magic. When Eragon found it, I just could not wait to see what happened next. It's that kind of adventure.The bond Eragon and Saphire share is so strong. One day Eragon is a farm boy - the next day he's a hero. Amazing!I quickly came to find that Eragon is one of those films you can't really call a film, because it's beyond a film - it's a quest, a fulfilling adventure.For me, I certainly proved that a year can end very differently to how it starts. If anyone has anything negative to say about the film or the game, they had better keep it to themselves rather than spoil it for others. One of the students I knew loved dragons and had an Eragon poster in his room. I have no fear of flying and I would gladly team up with Eragon and Sapphire (I would ride a dragon of my own) and stand alongside Murtagh against Galbatorix.",Eragon
246,dinoqueen,Very Disappointing,3,16 December 2006,"I have read the book, and I have thought of it as a legendary fantasy adventure. When I saw that they were going to make the book a movie, I got very exited. Then came the trailers. And finally, December 15, 2006. The release date of the movie. We went to the movie on a Saturday, and I was expecting a wonderful fantasy adventure worthy of the book.About 15 minutes into the story, I started to get disappointed. First thing I noticed, Arya's ears weren't even pointed. Eragon's description in the book was Black hair. Eragon, the main character, had blond hair and blue eyes. Doesn't match the description at all. Durza, the Shade, didn't have maroon eyes, while in Christopher Paolini's Eragon had maroon. This left me with a sigh.(A bit of Spoilers here)The movie jumps into the story very hastily. Eragon wakes up in the middle of the night, takes his bow and arrow and decides to go hunting, while Arya hides Saphira's egg. Eragon finds the egg in the Spine, where he is hunting. The Empires knows, when the egg hatches for Eragon and Saphira bursts out and touches Eragon. And that begins the adventure.Important characters like Ajihad and Nasuada have only a few lines, Nasuada not even saying her name. The big battle for the Varden was too short. Most of the book was skipped, and pages in a book like that were not meant to be skipped.Overall, the acting was okay. The special effects nice. Saphira looking awesome, although she is not supposed to be feathered. 5/10.",Eragon
247,furiso1,good but lacked originality,8,5 April 2007,"this movie has got to be the best fantasy film i have seen since The Lord Of The Rings series, but it lacked orginality. The fight scenes were all good, but come on, a story about a DRAGON RIDER, it doesn't really seem to be a new idea, plus why did it have to be about a dragon, that is the most common mythical (apperently) creature, they've could've chosen a different type of creature to be the mount, they could've chosen another mythical creature, like a giant bat or a grifforn (a flying horse with a lions head). the graphics though was amazing, the magic scenes, and again the fight scenes were epic. I really hope the make the second part of it.",Eragon

He left SO many things out.....added things that didn't happen......changed things.......and did you see the ending? The ending was completely different.....the ending wasn't even in the book...i mean get real. Anyone who has read the book first is going to notice. Plus...the traveling in the movie took wayyy less time....in the movie it took a day...while in the book it took weeks.It sort of seems that they didn't plan it out very well, and Brom looked to young to be Brom.

249,juarez-8,Better than expected,7,16 July 2008,"I had read lots of negative reviews about this film and when my brother got the DVD I was a bit against the idea of watching it because of the reviews. But I can safely say that I enjoyed it a lot just don't take it too seriously.The acting was better than I expected- Edward Speleers, Jeromy Irons, Alun Armstrong and Garrett Hedlund stand out the most. Sadly the rest of the cast have to work with poor dialogue (John Malcovich, Rachel Weiz etc).The special effects had their flaws but were overall good. The final fight scene involving two dragons looks incredible and is the reason why if you are like me who appreciates good visuals, to get this on Blu ray.If you didn't like this film, than you probably had your expectations too high but I didn't and I liked it. I just hope they do a sequel to win back fans of the books.",Eragon
250,school_account,Simply use a different cast,1,10 March 2010,"If they had used the cast from the TV series of Merlin, This would have been a much more enjoyable movie. Merlin obviously hadn't been made back then. But the point is that if the casting directors had been as careful and skillful as they had been on Merlin this would have been a success. I.E John Hurt as the Dragon and the fantastically talented Colin Morgan as the lead. What a Dragon needs is gravitas ably supplied by John Hurt's amazing voice. When a TV show can outdo a movie there is something wrong big time! The SFX are good but then you would expect that from a Major Motion Picture. But the acting and direction are very poor.",Eragon
251,littlejimmy835,"The makers of this movie need to learn that just because the movie looks like The Lord of the Rings, doesn't mean that the movie itself will be good.",3,20 December 2006,"3/10 To put it simply, Eragon lacks. The story is rushed unexplained and poorly thought out, the acting is below par, and the cinematography is annoying with its tilted angles and range so close to the action so that you can't see what is going on.The writing of the movie is by far its weakest aspect. The story is rushed quickly jumping from one thing to the next without any plot development so the viewer is left constantly wondering what is going on, one second our main character is a naive farmer, the next he is suddenly a fully experienced warrior with absolutely no evidence showing exactly where he gained this experience from. Entire scenes of the movie plod along with absolutely no meaning or relevance to the story, scenes which should have been cut out of the movie to make the narrative flow better. Characters come and go as they please with no relevance to the story, such as the archer who just suddenly appears out of nowhere and then just aimlessly follows the main characters without actually adding anything to the story. It almost seems as if the movie was written by a 9th grade high school student for his English class.The acting of the movie is far below par, as it seems that nobody in this movie seems to have emotions as if all the characters were cyborgs from the Terminator series or Steven Segal. For example there is the scene where the main character discovers that the stone he has found isn't a rock but actually a dragon egg as the egg hatches. Now normally people seeing a small monster burst out of a rock would express quite some level of surprise or shock, but all our star does is raise his eyebrows slightly and give a pathetic tiny gasp. Every character in the entire movie is like this, if someone is crying over a slain comrade all they do is frown and have a look of ""dang it"" on their face, if someone is cheering over victory, all they do is leer and go ""woooo"". The emotion is non existent.Eragon is a poor movie at best that fails to be entertaining, especially when compared to the other movies it is copying they style of such as ""Lord of the Rings"" and ""Harry Potter"". It seems that the makers of this movie thought, ""This movie has swords, magic, old English style speech, horses and dragons, it therefore must be good"". They were wrong. The belief that just because your movie looks a bit like ""Lord of the Rings"" it must be good like it, is incorrect.",Eragon
252,FlippanTadpole,Fantastic,10,27 October 2007,"I love this movie! Seeing the transformation of the characters is amazing. I like seeing characters grow and change their ways. There is also a good cast of actors and actresses. The cinematography and special effects were spectacular too. I think it would be cool if dragons existed today. I would love to be a dragon rider. I just really enjoy fantasy stories like these. Good verses evil, dragons, strange and new lands, magic, rogues, mysteries, swords - who can go wrong with these elements? I wish this movie would get better overall ratings. Bottom line, watch the movie for yourself and form your own opinions. Hopefully positive ones. I cannot wait to see the sequels. I look forward to reading the books too.",Eragon

However, if you haven't read the book ether then this will hopefully make you want to see this great film.The visuals were stunning and it was acted really well. It started off a little bit slow but was necessary but when the action starts it's definitely worth the wait. The only problem I had was with the actor who played King Galbatorix. He spoke with an obvious American accent that just didn't portray the evil that this character was. Fortunately he didn't have too many lines so it was forgivable.I thoroughly enjoyed this film.",Eragon
254,gullcrap_slithroat,You can tell where the director got his ideas from,6,22 December 2006,"I went to see Eragon with my mates, and I was going in hoping that the reviews were wrong. Unluckily, they were right.Eragon is a disappointment. The ideas have been used before (the princess stealing something from the king is a bit like Leia stealing the plans from Darth Vader in Star Wars), and the Razaaks look like Kroenen from Hellboy (notice the blades sticking out of their hands). Ed Speelers is not a very good actor, and I found him on the whole unconvincing. Jeremy Irons and Robert Carlyle were good, and so was John Malkovich (they should have had him in the film longer than about 5 minutes). Some of it is pretty predictable, like you can tell that Brom (a dragon rider, like Eragon who is a bit like Obi Wan in Star Wars, as he is a Jedi and is mentor to another Jedi, Luke) will die (like in Star Wars, Obi Wan dies to help Luke, and in this he dies to save Eragon).Overall, go and see this if you want to waste time and money, but don't bother if you are looking for a good film.",Eragon
255,digginglife66-1,Adaptation?,2,22 April 2008,"Eragon was supposed to be an attempt to remake the New York Times bestselling book, adapted into a movie. Instead the crew of the film produced a crude and very messed up version of the masterpiece. Humoring that a teenager could produce a better piece of work than the hooligans hired to adapt his book.The only thing the movie had going for it was the casting, not that all cast members did a good job on the acting, they(almost) looked the parts. The only real person that acted their part was Rachel Weisz as Saphira's voice. Djimon Hounsou wasn't given enough screen time and the character of Nasuada didn't even exist unless someone actually took time to read the credits. Angela's character was given two minutes as a background character and where in the world was Solembum? Special effects weren't anything to shake a leg at except for Saphira. The scene with the Battle Under Farthen Dur was a brief skirmish instead of the ""Helm's Deep"" of The Two Towers that it should have been. And what was up with the Urgals? They looked like steroid induced stunt men whereing makeup instead of the gruesome monsters they were.Like so many have said before me: skip it.

I don't understand that. Because of it's success there must be a movie based on the book. ""Great""! The story was boring and contained several schemes. The young boy who are the chosen? No! Not again!!! I think Eragon is the mixture of Frodo and Luke Skywalker - mixture of their worst attributes. Sapphira? Oh, yeah! A Dragon who mustn't be killed. Such an individual mark of this bad film. Jeremy Irons and Malkovich could have saved this movie but their acting were as poor as the other freak and amateur actors. I think because of the director's poverty. When will the movie-maker guys be able to understand that making a copy of other movies not a sin. But that's it when they can't sell it as an exciting film and they cannot bring any own idea in it. That's the problem with Eragon. And I'm not talking about only the movie... 4/10, because it's not an Uwe Boll-movie.",Eragon
258,dnlgg,has a lotta charm but suffers from some stupid dialogue and plotting,7,17 December 2006,"Eragon is a very uneven film, some parts are very well done and manage to have an amazing amount of subtly and heart. Eragon, Saphira, and Brohm, (sp?) are very likable and one wishes more of the film was built around them, but most of the other characters are barely sketched out. If the studio that made this film cared enough to actually go all out and make something of real quality rather than cut corners to get a film out quickly this could have been a real classic. you can almost see where they were taking their time and building up a good movie and then someone came along and rushed them to the next thing. the entire film feels very rushed. Some of the dialogue is great and some of it is the worst possible rubbish. This film is worth seeing at a matinée or for a dragon fanatic. For compelling characters and storyline it is an interesting, charming coulda been. I haven't read the book but seeing all the great ideas in this film I definitely am going to read it.",Eragon
259,EffixC,Should have slept instead of watching this movie,4,14 February 2007,"Sorry for my too-straight summary,but I DO feel like that.Why not just sleep on bed,or play some video game?Eragon the movie confuses me lots,and makes me think I was watching a 80's movie,with not-so-good CGI,and bad performance from all the actors.I've not read the book,so I think the screenplay did a terrible re-make.All the time the story line jumps,flashes,and forwards or rewinds but all unclear.I couldn't even tell a friend what the movie mainly about.A tale?Might.A adventure story of a ordinary boy who then becomes a hero?Maybe.A RPG-type story?Yes! All the whole time when I was suffering this movie in theater,I thought about some RPG games,all the same,they're.From the beginning our hero was still a nobody,then someday he got something,mostly a weapon,or like Eragon in the movie,a dragon egg,this thing brought him not only the power,but the tragedy of losing family.Then,he's on the road,half for revenge,half for the good side people who just need a hero to protect them.Then,the ending may contain something sad,like he lost the wise elder.But mostly,a good one,no matter how strong and powerful the enemy is,our hero could make it.See the traditional one-hit rule?Hit the boss's heart and he'll die as you wish.So...I've been told the author of Eragon also wrote two other books,in series.Maybe they're worth the money,but the movie?NO.Suggest those who are too boring to pick out a DVD to kill the time,choose this one,and find how stupid the actors (especially Eragon's cast) are.You can laugh,of course.",Eragon

Although we do need to odd poor movie to prod the watcher to remind themselves to go and see a decent one I find it remarkable that the producers actually read the screenplay and decide it would be a good idea to make this film? Evidently they did, pity.A mixture of an attempted passion of Braveheart, mixed with a sense of badly executed Gladiator stylised emotion, blessed with something that could have only come from Highlander combined with a script that reminds us all to constantly ‘take care’ (god if I hear that dialogue again I will kill someone) with a continuous failing attempt at giving very short story line that doesn’t actually mean anything until the last 20 minutes of which concludes a fight scene.Jurassic Park was is a better film than this, and that is saying something.

261,egorho,Good Movie but should be R and definitely not PG,9,16 December 2006,"My 13 year old son read the book a couple of years ago. He loved it so when they announced that a movie was due out we where both anxious to see. First he says the movie isn't true to the book in some scenes but that it was still a great movie. He loved it and so did I.The newcomer who plays Eragon does a great job in his first movie role. He was believable and he acted the part like a seasoned actor. Of course, Jeremy Irons is ALWAYS good in any movie he is in and this is no different.The storyline progress very good and there are no dull parts. My only question is how this movie EVER got a PG rating. The look of the creatures is enough to get it to a PG-13. There was a parent there with 2 small children (approx. 4-6 yrs.old) and it was too much for one of them. In addition, the crudeness and killings make this more of a teenage movie, borderline adult. So if you go, just think if you want a kid under 10 maybe to see this. Dragons, torture, blood, fighting are all here. But every teenage boy will LOVE this movie. The girls should too. Great way to spend a Saturday afternoon. Go see it and read the second book Eldest. I feel a sequel coming on.",Eragon
262,LittleNiniel,Someone got to love it =),5,15 December 2006,"And guess what! I seem to be one of the few out there who actually liked the movie! XD Sure I thought it was way sad that SO much was dropped or changed and the movie was way short for that kind of story. It was rushed indeed. But I really really liked it. Me and my best friend got really charmed. Saphira is gorgeous! O_o What a charming and cute dragon! I liked! I was very curious about Murtagh because he's my favourite in the book and of what I had heard I was a nervewrack when it came to him. And I can't believe I'm saying this, but I was kinda satisfied... O_o Yeah I was! lol. He should have been more in the movie, but it actually worked for me. The fact that he pops up now and then kept people interested and I could hear other people in the theater going all ""Hmmmm"" and ""oooh"" when he kept following Eragon. They kept the mysterious Murty if ya asked me. But he's still too different from the book for sure. But I think Garret did a great job. He's strange, but I like him. I like strange. I didn't like the scar though... I always imagined it a little bigger... and of course on the back. And it all went to fast... in the movie. And he kicked ass in the Varden =) I was sad not to see his horse Tornac though, but hey! He got Brom's pretty horse! I fit the horse! hehehe. I want piccies from those parts where they ride to Varden! Man I can go on forever... Where to start? Where to end? I think the acting was pretty good. Eragon, Ed Speelers did a pretty good job actually. Brom, for whatever reason reminded me of Jack Sparrow at time (Don't even ask), I liked Arya a lot although her role is way bigger then in the book and she takes Murty's spot! But It didn't really bug me as much as I would have thought. Murtagh is as I said, accepted. Bigger role would been even better.The music was okay, I love Avril's song! It's gorgeous, but they cut it down in the credits! Grrr! And I swear Garret's last name was HeLdlund... not Hedlund... haha ah well.Scenes I liked... Uhm... Murtagh popping up now and then! Wiihiii! There came a little ""Woop!"" from me when he first is seen in... Daret? And then when he aims his arrow towards Eragon and you don't really know if it's he he will shoot. I also loved all the riding in the landscapes parts. Beautiful! And they kept at least a little ""Eragon and Murtagh"" bonding in the movie, but sadly waaaaay too little. Lovely that Murty still saves his life. They're so cute. Should have been more scenes between them, but well I got the book! :P OOhhhh and the waking up scene at the end... *clutches heart* That was a sweet moment. But also the one right before where sad with Eragon and Saphira on the battle field. Oh! I loved most scenes with Saphira. Everyone went ""Awwwwwwwwwwwwwwwww"" in the theater. Everyone!!! At the baby Saphira. Man that was cute! I loved Rachel's voice! Brilliant! Anyway so to end it somewhere... I am tired now and it's in the middle of the night so I have probably messed up everything here and forgotten stuff :P But all in all. I love the movie - I love the book. They are like two different stories, but I love both. Minus for all the changes from the book (although they don't disappoint me as much as expected and as they do to others) and because of the shortness of the movie. Waaaaay way short! + for Saphira, Murtagh and just the fact that I wasn't as disappointed as I thought... Oh One last thing! You can't compare the story to LOTR! LOTR is unique... Eragon isn't as good (seen away from it being different from the book), but... I mean... What do I mean... haha... Just don't compare those two... as in how good they are (not the likeness) It's easy to impress me! =) And my best friend loved it too...

The dragon effects are well done, though the dragon herself is awkwardly put together and reminded me of a giraffe crossed with a dinosaur. The bad guys are truly creepy looking, there's some strong, dark imagery there. Older kids might like this if they are into the books, but the crowd of middle school young teens who sat through this one with me spent much of the movie listening to ipods, running up and down the aisles, making snide remarks, and fidgeting. In key scenes, they were quiet and attentive, but after the movie, the crowd was loudly disappointed and scornful - nobody liked it. Normally I don't like a theatre to be a quasi-playground, but I actually didn't mind, as it gave me something to focus on that was less boring than the movie.

I actually enjoyed the books, and I fully intend to read the third one when it comes.This movie, however, is a different story. However average the book was, it still had some bright sides, it had some sort of story. The movie seemed to me to be a montage, a series of separate scenes jumbled together by an intern with nothing better to do.The book had a lot of flaws, yes, I agree to that. The movie had a gazillion more flaws though - I'd go as far as saying you have to be a rabid fanboy bordering on insanity to say this movie is anywhere close to the quality of the book (and that's not saying all that much really, since the book isn't exactly top quality literature).There's a few bright sides though: 1. Saphira is pretty well made. 2. It's better than Dungeons & Dragons. Not much, but still better. 3. Since they cut all the characters who will become important in the sequel, we can assume no sequel will be made. Thank whichever God you worship for that.",Eragon
266,lawwellsy,"Potential exists, but isn't fully realised.",5,19 December 2006,"Eragon is not a bad film. In the same stream, it isn't a good film either. About a boy called Eragon (change E to D, see any connection?), who finds a dragon egg. It hatches, and he has to save his homeland, Alagaseia from the evil king Galbatorix. This is, however, the first part in a trilogy, which is somewhat fitting, given that Eragon's author, Christopher Paolini, is nuts about all things Tolkein.Not having read the book, I've no idea whether or not the problem is with Paolini or its adaptation. However, in spite of Jeremy Irons (Brom) and John Malkovich's (Galbatorix) best, they can't save the poor writing. Ed Speelers is in his first feature film, and it shows. Rachel Weisz does a brilliant job as the telepathic dragon Saphira, although sometimes the lines aren't what you'd call first rate.The dialogue is sorely lacking in many areas (such as the climax of the film), and a lot of the minor characters are underused. The special effects feast which is the final battle places too much focus on Eragon and Saphira - its as though their duel with Durza is the main event, and the main battle just a sideshow. Don't get me wrong, its not that it wasn't fun, its that a lot was missed out on (what with LOTR, Star Wars, Troy, all with thousands of computer generated soldiers fighting each other).This exposes another of the film's flaws - it clocks in at less than 1 hour and 40 minutes. Being longer could've allowed a greater use of the minor characters and more dialogue. Whether that was the fault of editing or lazy writing, I'll never know.In terms of the raw special effects though, its certainly something. Saphira is the centerpiece, and is most certainly something - you could go and see the movie just for her (but tickets being so expensive, I'm not so sure about that). Some other parts, though, could've used more attention - I'm not sure what was happening to Durza's face at the end, and Galbatorix's fortress, while still good, might've been a bit more menacing than a stone box.Really, while this film could've been something great, it was let down by poor writing, an editor who was too happy to cut out scenes, and a lack of imagination. Speelers didn't do too bad a job, all things considered, but not even the best efforts of Malkovich and Irons can save this film.5 out of 10",Eragon

I know all so that it will be different BUT what I didn't understand was WHY did they let this script pass the OK? It was rushed and some things just did not make scene characters were off and sometimes a bit annoying.

It feels almost like a couple of days go past in a few seconds. One moment it's day, the next it's night. The leading character changes his mind so often with very little explanation or feeling it's frankly confusing.Performances and voices feel wooden, the only thing that saves it really, are, it's, quite an interesting storyline if a little bland, the main action sequence is good, nothing to complain about (unless I guess if you've read the book), and then of course there's the overwhelming schmaltzy cuteness factor and an animated dragon.It was later I found out that the six foot bearded men were supposed to be dwarfs, while the main female character was supposed to be Elfish...",Eragon

People were making phone calls, milling about. I've never ever seen more people disinterested any movie this way. The popcorn was good at least, and we really enjoyed making fun of this movie.

The seen with Angela is just retarded and Mawd doesn't even appear. 3) Everything with Arya is just....completely wrong in reference to her character as an elf. 4) The whole battle on the way tothe Varden doesn't happen and the Varden itself is horrible. In thebook it makes it out to be this underground palace, where in the movieit is a crappy village in the middle of a crater. 5) The twins are non-existent as well as Orik. The ""dwarfs"" in this movie are all like feet tall and look like normal men. 6) Key characters in the book have like 15 second parts in the movie. 7) The battle between Durza and Eragon is sooo horrible. They completely changed it. In the book Eragon is on the ground fighting Durza and then Durza wounds him and the Elf Elder contacts him. In the movie, Eragon is riding on the back of Saphira as Durza is riding some evil demon spirit or something. 8) In the end of book 1, everyone is together. In the movie, Arya is riding back to her homeland and Eragon is staying with the Varden. In the book Arya has to TAKE Eragon to the elves. 9) In the book Arya is shying away from Eragon. In the movie it looks like they are equal in wanting to get with each other. 10) To be perfectly honest, the only thing I really liked about this movie was seeing Saphira as she hatched and cause she was wicked cute. That reminds me of another thing. In the movie, Brom is discussing names for Dragons and we watch how Saphira grows. In the movie, she flies into a storm and all of a sudden is 20 times her original size, lands and tells Eragon her name.If you love the book, Do Not Go See This Movie. You will be soooo disappointed as I was. I normally don't pay attention to anything the critics say as I normally disagree with them, but for once I can't. They said this movie was poor and it really was. The only good part about this movie if you want to call it that was some of the special effects.Also, if you thought this movie was decent, go read the book and you will see how horribly wrong you were.",Eragon
271,kari_d,Was looking forward to it (even with the bad reviews) - too bad,6,20 November 2008,"I was disappointed. I read the books, which were fine (not terribly great, but pretty good for a young author). I knew from reading previous reviews that the movie deviated from the book a lot. I was prepared to keep an open mind and view the film as it is, and not what the book is. I was looking forward to it! The sets were beautiful, had a good cast, CGI was fantastic (great Saphira!), and a prepared storyline  what went wrong? The two biggest problems were: the terrible dialog and the overly dramatic music (made you roll your eyes). Both could have been remedied with a longer movie. They crammed it all in to an hour and a half. They didn't have time to flesh out the characters, develop the plot  so the dialog was sparse, often cheesy, and just didn't make you like the characters. It felt forced. Jeremy Irons is a great Brom!! Too bad his lines were so lame. What was that scene with Angela? The scene with the Urgals working  you could tell they were just trying to look busy. You could see through the ""acting"" because the time was so short, they had nothing to do. I also felt they tried to make the Urgals into too much like the Uruks of the LoTR. The overly dramatic music worked in Lord of the Rings because it was a longer movie and so were able to really hook you into the world. You weren't ""in"" this world. You weren't part of the problems. The music felt corny. I felt like they tried to make it like Lord of the Rings, but failed because you just can't do it in 1hr 42 min. That's why the LoTR movies were up near the 3hr mark. Granted, I'm not saying make this a 3hr movie. But a good 2 or 2.5 hours, better dialog, more attention to detail (Arya's ears), more character development (mention Hrothgar, Naduada) sure would have helped. Too bad. My husband, who didn't read the books, gave it a 6.8.",Eragon
272,rickz,I loved it,10,7 March 2007,"I was thoroughly enchanted by the movie. Some people say you should try to see things ""thru the eyes of a child."" Obviously, we have a bunch of children here as reviewers -- who decided (by reading the book) what the movie should look like, and now (sob sob) it's different.Grow up! Movies are not books. If you can't get that thru your head, give up one or the other.The flying scenes were the best I've every seen, the dragon (obviously modeled after a young kitty cat) was totally captivating. I loved the scenery (reminded me of places I've been too all over the world) and most of the characters (good guys anyway) reminded me of people I have met, known, and loved.Too bad, kiddies, that you couldn't see the movie with fresh eyes. And too bad that the reviews seem to have killed it. (It's doing poorly at Box Office.) rz",Eragon
273,thedriver829,A Film Plagued By Wasted Potential,4,15 December 2016,"On my 11th birthday, I remember the first gift I opened before I went to school was the book Eragon. As a kid who loved Harry Potter and Lord of the Rings (and still do to this day), I was excited to read into this newer fantasy book. I enjoyed it very much as a kid, and to this day I still think it is a good book despite a few flaws I've noticed more now that I'm older.And of course, around the time I read the Eragon book, the film adaptation was getting ready to come out. I was so excited. I was expecting a film on par with The Lord of the Rings and The Chronicles of Narnia. Sadly, two things started to discourage me as the film's release grew closer: 1) The film's MPAA rating was PG and 2) the film's running time was only 104 minutes. This got me worried, and the reviews for the film by critics and fans didn't exactly help. Needless to say, I was disappointed by this adaptation, but not just because it took out some of my favorite parts from the book, but because it wasn't a good movie either.For those of you who are not familiar with the book, Eragon is based off the book by Christopher Paolini, who started writing it when he was only 15 years old and got it published when he was 18. The story is set in the magical world of Alagaesia, which was once ruled by a group of warriors known as the Dragon Riders. However, one day a rider named Galbatorix betrays the riders and kills them all, making himself king over Alagaesia. Fast forward a few hundred/thousand years later and we meet a young boy named Eragon, who stumbles upon a magical blue stone while hunting in the wilderness. He originally thinks that he can use it to buy meat for his family, but he quickly learns that the stone is actually a dragon egg. And when the dragon egg hatches, Eragon becomes the next dragon rider.As you can tell by reading the synopsis, this story is very similar to other fantasy films such as Star Wars, Lord of the Rings, etc. Of course, this was also a criticism of the book as well, but at least it had likable characters, epic action scenes, and a great level of detail that brought the world to life. These things were at least present in order to make the story compelling, even if it is beat by beat the story of Star Wars. This film version has barely any of that. The characters aren't fleshed out enough to where you care about them. The action is dumbed down in order to create a PG fantasy film for children. Alagaesia itself isn't set apart from any other fantasy worlds we've seen before. The movie just feels like no effort was really put into it except when it came to the visual effects, which are almost too good for this movie.This is mostly due to a really poor script. I'm not just talking about the dialogue, which is some of the worst I've ever heard (""I'm the rider and I say we go""), but the way the story is set up feels like they just took a few scenes from the book and slapped it together to make a movie that was under two hours so they could make a quick buck. Characters appear that have very little screen time and ultimately feel pointless. Even characters that provide importance to the later books are minimized or just simply don't appear at all. It's not structured well, and you can tell that the passion for the source material that fueled the makers of LOTR and Harry Potter is not here at all.Even the action sequences are not all that spectacular. Part of me wants to blame the film's PG rating, but we've seen other movies with this rating that were able to create epic and enjoyable action scenes. The only part that is really enjoyable and entertaining is the final confrontation between Eragon and Durza, the film's main antagonist, which also leads to an scene afterward that had quite a bit of emotion to it. However, anyone expecting epic battle sequences on par with LOTR are probably going to be as disappointed as I was.As far as the acting goes, there are actually a few good performances here, the best of which being Jeremy Irons as Brom. You can tell that he was having fun with the role and was doing his best with the material he was given. Ed Speleers also does a fair job as Eragon, and had this film actually been successful, I would have been interested in seeing him star in more films. Djimon Honsu is also good in his brief role as Ajihad, and Rachel Weisz does a decent job as the voice of Saphira. Most of the other actors fall flat, with the two worst performances coming from John Malkovich, who looks like he's ready to stop shooting and get his paycheck, and Robert Carlile, who takes what could be a compelling villain and makes him absolutely silly.Ultimately, Eragon is wasted potential. It's a movie that could have been great had they put more effort into everything other than the visual effects and handled the adaptation process a little more seriously. I'm not saying that a movie has to be 100% faithful to the source material, but in this case, it would have worked better for the movie and for the potential sequels that could have come from it. In the end, it's not one of the worst movies ever made, but it is definitely one that was disappointing to me and other fans of the book, as well as those looking for the next LOTR or Harry Potter.",Eragon
274,anda-alexandra-86,The Book VS. The Movie > The Book Wins This Time!,8,10 November 2015,"Brom: narrating - There was a time when the fierce and beautiful land of Alagaësia was ruled by men astride mighty dragons. To protect and serve was their mission, and for thousands of years, the people prospered. But the Riders grew arrogant, and began to fight among themselves for power. Sensing their weakness, a young Rider named Galbatorix betrayed them, and in a single bloody battle, believed he had killed them all, Riders and dragons alike. Since then, our land has been ruled by Galbatorix. He crushed all rebellion, including the freedom fighters known as the Varden. Those that survived fled to the mountains. There, they hoped for a miracle that might even their odds against the king. Our story begins one night, as Arya, an ally of the Varden, rides for her life, carrying a stone stolen from the king himself...Oh, alrighty there! Let me just say that this is how the movie starts, with Brom telling the story of Alagaësia. All good there, Jeremy Irons (who plays Brom like a charm) has a soothing voice that beckons you to sit down and listen to his stories, but what he says is not entirely by the book and if you read the book first - like I did - you might get upset. The Riders did not grew arrogant and they did not fight between themselves until Galbatorix came along and began to act high and mighty! He is the reason the Riders were killed and the dragons as well. And Arya - who is an elf - did not steal the stone stolen from the king. She was guarding it for many years. The stone was actually a dragon egg - one of the 3 in the books that still remained unhatched! - that was carried back and forward between the elves and the dwarfs - which, by the way, do not appear at all in the movie! but in the book they hold a great part of the story. But never-mind that",Eragon
275,kenlcc,"a mix of LOTR, Dragon Heart, and Harry Potter, and that is totally stupid",2,19 December 2006,"As I've said in the summary, this movie is like a mix of LOTR, Dragonheart and Harry Potter, and this makes the concept of the movie like a pirated CD, mixing everything good into it, and ruined it pretty badly with bad acting and stupid storyline.Copying other movie's concepts is OK IF they succeed in making the movie interesting and natural, but this, this is trying too hard. I mean, just look at the names of the characters.....Galbatorix....what kind of a stupid name IS THAT??? They might have named the king ""Optimus Prime"".....ah.....that's better. And what have they done to the development of the main character? NOTHING!!! They just put there in the script: Eragon = Born Genius........and that's it! They are so darn lazy! too lazy! Eragon doesn't even NEED to learn how to use magic, he JUST KNEW. He doesn't even need to learn how to fight with his dragon, he JUST KNEW. He's a genius and that is how they cut the cost of this movie, by making every bit simple, and that means, making more money. And the most cost efficient part is, DON'T MAKE THE DRAGON TALK WITH HER MOUTH!!! They've cut the cost for the DRAGON'S CGI. The producers said: ""if the Dragon's uses her mouth to talk, then we'll loose 5 bucks of every word she says!"". Everyone who watched Dragon Heart a long time ago will notice that the mouth of THAT dragon moved, brilliantly!!! Now that's what I called movie making.They added those elements which LOTR lacked of, like the use of magic to make the movie......more....""entertaining"", yeah, that's the word. But even they did this, this movie is not considered as ""slightly"" entertaining, it even doesn't come to the word ""interesting"", the word which will suit this movie is ""money/time wasting"".So why does LOTR so darn good, so darn entertaining, so darn interesting...? why? the guys in LOTR don't know sh*t about magic....except Gandalf, even the heroes don't use magic....and the worst part is the Hobits....they don't know nothing, yet they are the most important characters....they only knows how to eat and sleep... Eragon is born a genius, 'cause he's the hero, of course he's special. He know how to use magic, just tell him the magic word....and i think almost EVERYONE in this movie knows how to use it, and there are other elements in this movie, more than any movie....it has magic that LOTR and Dragonheart doesn't have, it has dragons that Harry Potter doesn't have enough, and LOTR doesn't even has dragons, this movie has EVERYTHING....well...EVERYTHING that a 9 year old child want.....but for an adult who has a taste for movies, it is just suitable for a 9 year oldAh.........i know now what this movie lacks......depth..........and also a new storyline",Eragon
276,teigeng,Mediocre But Enjoyable Fantasy Tale,5,22 December 2006,"I have not read the book, Eragon. I have heard horrible things about both the book and the movie. I came into this film expecting it to be godawful. It was actually quite a fun little adventure, though hardly anything to write home about.Basically, the story is about a boy named Eragon (Edward Speelers) who comes across a dragon egg that hatches the dragon Saphira (voiced by Rachel Weisz). After his uncle is killed by mercenaries of the evil king (John Malkovich) he, accompanied by a former ""dragon rider"" named Brom (Jeremy Irons) try to find the enemies of the evil king and join forces. They make a side trip to rescue a princess (Sienna Guillory) from the an evil sorcerer, Durza (Robert Carlyle) who works for the evil king. All of this builds up to a big climatic battle at the end.The story is really cliché. The plot line very much parallels Star Wars (the dragon rider and the dragon substituting for the Death Star plans; Brom substituting for Obi-Won; the evil king is Emperor Palpatine, etc.) and the names of the characters and all the places are reminiscent of LOTR. John Malkovich's presence truly screamed ""I'm getting paid a million bucks to say a couple lines and to be John Malkovich."" I was really hoping Sienna Guillory's character would die because she was played so horribly.Despite this, I found myself fervently rooting for Eragon and Saphira. This is one of the few times I have actually rooted for the heroes in a story (I prefer villains, as they are more interesting to me). I don't really know why, but Speelers and Weisz just did it for me. I also must compliment Carlyle's performance as Durza the Shade. He was genuinely creepy and Carlyle seemed to be having fun in the role. The scene where he and Eragon face off above the battle below is spectacular.Overall, it was a good way to spend the evening and munch on some popcorn. This is not high quality cinema but I would say it is high quality entertainment.",Eragon

This movie was first and foremost not plagued by bad actors, the acting was lacking nothing in my opinion. This is a great fantasy movie for anyone looking to go see a flick that takes their mind off of the real world and puts it into this dream world. The only thing this movie needed was to be longer!People are also saying that it doesn't follow the book, well I have never read the book but all I know is, in a world of remakes, sequels, old TV shows turned into crap movies, this flick was a breath of fresh air. Besides don't people like when movies don't follow the book exactly?!? Its called an artistic licence and it is what directors, writers, actors, and painters use to convey what THEY want the point to be, not what you wanted it to be!!! I would PAY to see it again!

I've read enough of the book to understand the characters and their purpose, but the movie makes it look like a joke. I can't say I liked the book. While exceptional writing was at display, it was a cheap fantasy of a boy ending up saving the world - which here looks like the outback of Asutrailia. It might appeal to kids who've never even knew the book existed and might also draw the attention of hardcore fans. As a movie, this was a really great failure. It felt like a really bad episode of Xena and has no hopes of carrying on two sequels.I am not exerting hate here, the movie was really bad.",Eragon
280,LemonVampire,Not that terrible,3,18 March 2007,"When I first heard about this movie I was really disappointed to hear that such an undeserving book was getting the film treatment. But given it's popularity I tried to read some of the book for a couple chapters before realizing there were better things to do with my time. So yeah I haven't actually read the book but I got the general idea. I think one of the reasons why this movie gets so much hate is because it's source material really didn't deserve the attention it got. The book is nothing special or new. It's some of the most generic fantasy ever written and the only reason it became popular was because it was written by a teenager and was sold right next to Harry Potter. Since most Harry Potter fans haven't otherwise read fantasy when bookstores pushed it on them they were taken in by the similar cover art. Now, I don't think the book is terrible, just generic. It doesn't bring anything new at all to fantasy, but there is a lot of generic fantasy, hence the term, and there's no reason to hate this more than the rest. Except that Eragon became wildly popular for no reason and they made a movie about it when there are a lot of other great fantasy books that could have made great movies instead of this. Anyway, I went to see the movie, with some fans of the book, just because there were dragons in it and there are so few dragon movies. So from the start I expected this movie to be terrible. I wasn't very disappointed. It is a bad movie but it's not completely bad. I've seen much worse. Overall this movie is pretty decent. The biggest flaw I found in it is that there aren't any characters, just people. No one in this entire movie has a personality. There all just people dressed up as stereotypes with nowhere to go. There's the peaceful but serious farm boy, the serious but peaceful mentor, the dangerous but kind rogue, the strong but feminine princess, and the kind but aggressive dragon. Even the villains were bland. If they had been over-the-top maniacal laughter villains it would have been stupid but at least it would have been something. These characters go through the whole movie as though they jut don't care what's going on. Also the pacing goes a lot faster than it should with a story that, if you were interested enough to follow, would be a little difficult to do so. Anyway, with all that it's still not absolutely terrible. It's just plain. If you like dragons and fantasy and are in the mood for something generic with some decent effects sequences than this movie's okay.",Eragon

I realize that putting a book to film is no easy feat, but if you leave out or change too much it really has an adverse affect on persons watching the movie. It took me three times to get through this movie without falling asleep.Awesome pick of having John Malkovich for Galbatorix as well.

282,cbauman,"Different from the book, but very enjoyable",8,5 January 2007,"Anyone who has not read the book, or can accept that the story lines vary, would likely find this movie quite entertaining. The story itself is kind of a cross between Harry Potter (as a teen) and Lord of the Rings. Saphira's comments will bring a smile to your face, and Ed Speleers gives an outstanding performance- not to mention being very easy on the eyes! The entire cast does a spectacular job, although on a couple of occasions I found John Malkovich to be a little overly dramatic. But the cinematography is impressive, and the scenery is absolutely beautiful.It's been about 3 years since I read the book so I remembered only the gist of the story. It's true that the movie does not follow the book exactly, but the story progresses smoothly at an acceptable pace for being only an hour and 45 minutes. I found the variations between the book and the movie to be more logical and less disjointed than the lame film version of the Da Vinci Code.As a fan of the book I would have also enjoyed a longer, more detailed movie that followed the book more closely, however I would imagine that movie profits would have been significantly reduced- it would be too long for young children, a long movie would probably not appeal to anyone who has not read the book, and it would require either a larger budget for shooting or sub par cinematography.Overall, I highly recommend this movie and feel that anyone who thinks they might be interested in the movie ought to go see and decide for themselves!",Eragon
283,rushingj@swbell.net,"A 15 year old wrote the book, too bad he didn't write the screenplay and direct...",2,29 December 2006,"I didn't go into this movie thinking too much would come of it, but I did expect to see a reasonable attempt to translate what was a fairly entertaining story with a reasonably fleshed-out (if simplistic) world into the media of film.I read the book, but even had I not, I'd still have the two dozen or so questions I left this movie with still in my brain.So many pieces of the story are missing...the motivation for Eragon to leave his Uncle's farm, the true nature of Arya, Tronjheim and its vastness, the integral part that dwarfs play in the story, the Isidar Mithrim and the real tale of the demise of Durza, Murtaugh as more than a set piece, and the true and tragic end of the battle of Farthen Dur.These are not merely niceties that provide a backdrop to the story - they are key to the story and its proper telling.Ten minutes of well-written and adequately directed scenes and this film becomes a reasonable adaptation instead of the cut-and-paste get-it-out-by-the-holidays rush job that it appears to be.As to effects, yes the dragon is spectacular, but did they blow the whole budget on scenes with Saphira and the (not-exactly-by-the-book) battle with Durza? And what is with the Urgals? Overweight, bald guys in caveman suits? The director's vision (or lack thereof) are clearly to blame for these gaps in the way the story is told through effects.The 'world' is missing here, which though it is a simplistic one at best, it is still part of the tale and its telling...oh well, at least we've still got Peter Jackson.Before they go and muck up the second part of this tale on film, I hope the director and writers have the decency to make it clear that this is NOT the tale of Eragon and Alagaesia, but an oversimplification of a story that could have benefited from the media of film instead of being butchered by it.Pathetic, simplistic, one-dimensional storytelling at very nearly its worst.",Eragon

I read all the user comments here before I went to see the movie so I was honestly expecting the worse movie ever. Well it wasn't.Sure everything in the book was not in the movie but in all fairness there is very few movies out there that were first books that have everything in the movie. I mean get serious the book was almost 500 pages long. To put all that in a movie it would be over 4 hours long. I know some characters that were in the book were not in the movie but it all worked out pretty damn good. And they did add a few things in the movie that wasn't in the book but they made it really believable so it did not hurt the movie in one bit. My husband never read the book and he really enjoyed the movie also. To all those idiots trying to compare it to Lord of the Rings. You are really stupid.

286,stlmbrsn,Opinion from a book lover and a movie lover,6,14 July 2008,"I have read the first book and almost the second book in the Inheritance Series. Fortunately, I had enough time to finish the first book before the opening of the film. Instead of going to the theatre, I rented the film from Blockbuster, which probably was the best decision on my part. From the first chapter of the book, I found myself loving every minute of it. I still can't believe that Paolini began writing it when he was my age, 15 (I think...). I was quite excited to hear that the book was going to be made into a movie; however, after seeing the movie I was kind of disappointed. I did not expect the movie to follow the book completely (say Harry Potter for example) because fitting an 800 page book into a two hour movie is pretty much impossible. However, some of the small details such as Eragon's age were changed because the director said so (hey, it beats me). The book/movie tells the story of a young farm boy living with his uncle and cousin, Roran. The last dragon egg comes into Eragon's possession because of the actions of Arya,an elf, who must protect it from the King, Galbatorix, and his Shade, Durza. Long story short, with the help of Brom, also a dragon rider (sorry for those of you who haven't read the book or seen the movie!!!), Murtaugh, a mysterious archer, and his dragon, Saphira, Eragon destroys the Shade and restores peace to Alaegashia (the land, earth, where the story takes place). I apologize about the spellings! :}Considering that this movie was Ed Speleers's (He plays Eragon.) first movie, I believe he handled the job pretty well (Eragon was a much more emotional and deep character in the book). Yes, he isn't a leading Hollywood actor, but he didn't do too bad for a eighteen year old. Brom was played by Jeremy Irons. I think that he was great for the role! He has the sarcastic tone and attitude that I pictured Brom having. Murtaugh was played by Garrett Hedlund, who also was perfect for his role. Garrett has not been in many movies, but ""Troy"", ""Four Brothers"", and ""Friday Night Lights"" are in his resume. I predict and expect big things from you in the future, Mr. Hedlund!!! I believe that Sienna Guillory, who played Arya, was too old for the part. She was in her thirties at the time of the movie (quite to old for a fifteen or seventeen year old Eragon!!) Rachel Weisz was great as Saphira, the fire-breathing leading lady (or beast, whichever you prefer) of the film. She was a great asset to the cast.Here are my critiques: Why in the name of Davy Jones was Eragon 17? HMMMM? There was absolutely no point in changing his age other than to raise the audience's age?.... (I don't know I'm still guessing?) Also, I was disappointed in the limited knowledge and scenes involving Murtaugh. What happened to Eragon and Murtaugh bonding and becoming like brothers? What about Murtaugh's father/the origin of his scar?? Yes, there was like a millisecond of explanation, but more character development would have made the movie more poignant and emotional. Moreover, what about Nasuada, Ajihad's daughter and Angela, the fortune teller?? In these areas, the director and editors of the film did indeed leave out too much information, making the process of creating a sequel EXTREMELY difficult. To eat the director and writer's out some more (sorry guys), I found myself shuddering at some of the lines (especially Eragon when he says ""Then are we together Saphira? As one?!""...or something like that). Whether it was the delivery of the line or the actual line that made me shiver, I don't know. In the end, the movie was a great one, if one had not read the book. On the flip side of that, readers of the series tended to be disappointed with the film and I can't say I blame them. Whether you are a reader of the series or not and you find yourself disappointed with the final product of the film, go read the book again or go out and buy it!!! You won't be disappointed with the book. Thanks :} (wow that was longer than I thought...)",Eragon
287,mjpimpin91,Burn!!!,1,12 October 2008,"I have never walked out on a movie in a theatre, nor have I ever had the urge to until I watched this movie. The director killed the book, as did the writers. The acting was good, I will admit that. But this film butchered an otherwise okay book. I am a fan of The Inheritance Cycle, and this movie has very little in common, the only things being location names, character names, and a giant blue dragon named Saphira. There are about fifteen shots in the middle of the movie when Eragon is traveling on horseback, and the only thing different about each shot is that the background changes. Their riding...riding some more...riding more...UGH! Boring! No! Okay, I know for time purposes that they did this, but Saphira morphs from baby dragon to adult dragon by flying through the air. Pure. Simple. Laziness! The book took up a few chapters when dealing with the maturation of Saphira. The movie kills the scene in like five seconds. Galbatorix, who is not even in the books yet, is shown in the film. Angela the Herbalist (character from the book) looks like a hippie. Saphira has feathers on her wings. This movie was awful. No sequel. Ever. I beg you! Just remake it the way it should have been. But don't let Uwe Boll near it!",Eragon
288,Cinemibus,Aspiring Epic With the Wrong Stuff,2,25 December 2009,"This is a textbook example of what happens when a film maker tries to imitate another film seemingly without any idea of what made the other film such a success. In this case the other film is The Lord of the Rings trilogy, and the wannabe is Eragon, based on the best-selling fantasy novel by Christopher Paolini. The younger actors' names you will probably not recognize. This is because they were selected for looks, not acting skill. However, one would expect the older actors to do a decent job in their roles. As it is only Jeremy Irons pulls through, a bastion of entertainment over a sea of incompetence. Malkovich and Carlyle, meanwhile, provide two hilariously campy performances as the baddies and the rest seem to be barely acting at all. Perhaps this is partially due to the script, which gives Malkovich the unforgettably bad opening line, ""I suffer without my stone. Do not prolong my suffering."" I suppose he does his best, as do they all, but only Irons manages to put a vaguely humorous spin on the whole ordeal, adding personality to his character that it seems the screenplay was not kind enough to provide. The direction is bad, the acting is (mostly) bad, the screenplay is hopeless, and I could go on and on. Bottom line: Eragon is a disappointing entry in the fantasy genre that represents the utter ineptitude of its makers.",Eragon
289,edwie,Stay away if you are a film lover (WARNING.. SPOILERS AHEAD),1,19 December 2006,"These are 2 hours of my life I am not getting back (not to mention the 12 bucks). Awful movie! Full of clichés, predictable scenes, poor poor dialogue and some ""what the..."" scenes that did not help in improving the movie.I did not know there was a book, so I never knew anything about the story and yes, the movie was still BAD. Basically this is a movie about this Harry-Potter kind of kid who found an egg that this princess seems to have laid in the forest. Then I don't know for what reason, Lord Voldemort hires Senator Palpatin as a black magician who loves to eat dry Quik off spoons (hence his dirty teeth) and their mission is to stop the boy Eragon and his Muppet-looking dragon Shakira (hips don't lie).Then you see Voldemort and Palpatin finding the fort of the Three Wise Men (Melchior, Gaspar and Balthazar). Melchior is the ruler of them all and for some reason he has a daughter about the age of Eragon, who suddenly appears in the movie wearing designer clothing and sashaying around the fort while everyone else is worried about the upcoming war. Then when everyone is all protected in their armors, this girl shows up in this Versace armor... I don't get it.Then we have Jeremy Irons, who was kinda saving the movie until.. well you know.So we have Eragon riding this dragon who keeps mouthing off clichés from every imaginable fantasy movie, characters coming out of nowhere, and these murderers/fighters made of moth or ants or whatever chasing him all over.The silliest scene in the movie: Eragon dreaming about the princess who is running like Peasant Barbie in the forest and screaming 'save me!' while she runs away barefoot and listening to tunes in her IPod.Oh, and it gets better... there will be a sequel which I will definitely WON'T see.Sorry for being so harsh but I needed to vent out. They did know how to market trailer of this excuse of a movie.",Eragon
290,ninjapirate93,Disappointingly forgettable,3,8 October 2009,"'Eragon' is a film that could have been so much better. The acting is enthusiastic. The effects are excellent. The story is full of adventure. So what went wrong? The main reason is that the book has been incredibly compressed. The filmmakers seem to have inexplicably restricted themselves to only an hour and a half of film. Why? If an extra half-hour would help the story to flow more, and resolve some of the plot holes and blatant continuity errors, (horses disappearing, re-appearing, etc) then by all means, add it in! Films like 'The Lord of the Rings' and 'The Dark Knight' prove that a movie's running time is irrelevant as long as the story is told right.Also, the movie tries too hard to live up to the standards set by 'The Lord of the Rings' and 'Star Wars'. If only the filmmakers had tried to distance themselves from those films, or perhaps have a shred of originality in costume or set design, then we, the audience, would not notice all the shameless rip-offs.Also, John Malkovich's terrible, terrible delivery of the line: 'I suffer without my stone. Do not prolong my suffering.' always makes a little part of me die inside, but what can you do with a line like that? However, Eragon DOES have brilliant effects, most notably the dragons, and it looks fantastic. Colors are vivid and bright. They might almost distract you from all the plot holes and bad dialogue.In closing, while some movies are so agonizing to watch that they continue to haunt you forever, 'Eragon' is mostly harmless and will not cause any long-lasting damage.",Eragon
291,dolphin305,I thought it was good,7,23 May 2014,"I just finished watching the movie, and I thought it was really good. I enjoyed the movie. I looked online and found that many people said it was bad because it left out a lot of important parts that were in the book. In that case, I have nothing to say about that since I had never read the book.Spoiler coming up! Due to that last scene, I could definitely see a sequel is needed. Due to what they are saying about its comparison with the book, though, it does not appear that there will be one unless they redo the first movie and add the missing parts. (I need to fill up one or two more lines, so the rest of my review is nothing but hyphens -----------------------------------------------------------)",Eragon
292,justimagine93,Eragon the Movie,3,6 December 2013,"The book and movie are not similar at all. Being a movie that was supposedly inspired by Christopher Paolini's book series, known as The Inheritance Cycle, this movie has a long way to go if it were to come ANY close to accuracy. It seemed as if the director knew about this book and chose to make the movie nothing like the book or never read the book, but made a movie anyway. Eragon the Movie is a film that could stand on its own without the book, because then it would be a good movie. Although the moment you figure out that this movie is based on the book Eragon, you will sit there shaking your head throughout the entire movie. Eragon, in the book, was fifteen, brown haired, brown eyed, curious, and shared an intimate connection with an intelligent dragon. This Eragon in the movie, Ed Speleers, was not only blonde haired, blue eyed, and seventeen, but had a rebellious attitude and treated his dragon like dirt. In the book, dragons were regarded as highly intelligent beings, not spiky toothy steeds. In fact, the Saphira in the book would eat this Saphira in the movie for breakfast. Arya, in the book, was actually a strong independent female elf with pointy ears, long black hair, and wonderful green eyes. Being very mysterious and possibly dangerous, the Arya in the movie, Sienna Guillory, had no connections at all with the elf in the book. Brom in the movie, Eragon's mentor and portrayed by Jeremy Irons, seemed very pro Varden (like those college people that want you to go to their college) compared to the Brom in the book, who was actually trying to help Eragon avenge his Uncle's death by helping him track his killers. EVEN this Murtagh in the movie seemed VERY eager to help Eragon get to the Varden, while in the book Murtagh had ZERO intentions to even head towards the Varden. This movie is so messed up. There cannot be a sequel to this movie, because the plot line is too warped.",Eragon
293,lxmerrifield,Wow Epic Fail,2,21 August 2013,"Honestly if this movie was made by itself it would make a slightly better story from a 2/10 to 6/10 but the problem is it was based of an excellent book one i enjoyed quite a lot and the whole thing was butchered. The plot was stupid and way off of the books course, Galbatorix looked like a complete joke Brom was lame Eragon too happy for a boy who suffered the loss he did, in fact none of the characters fit the part but i did enjoy the dragon Saphira the way she looked in the movie was cool but other than that everything else failed.I hope they understand how badly they failed and do not attempt to make a second movie they should have that movie be a stand alone and try again with more effort because this made me angry at how badly they did.",Eragon
294,mtdavies,Very disconnected,5,18 December 2006,"When Lord of the Rings was done in movie form they did it the right way. They took the time to do an three extended movies as to not short cut the story line for expediency. Where Steven Jackson did right the director/producers of this movie did wrong. I know even Paoloni would say that he is no Tolkein, but when an epic story is written in the same vein as Tolkein...to do it justice it must be made into an epic film. This was not! I very much enjoyed the book, but felt very short changed on the movie. It jumped around too much...missed to much and didn't lay down the story line as beautifully as the book did. Do yourself a favor...read the book...if you want the Reader's Digest Condensed version...or the Cliff Notes version...then see the movie. It wasn't bad...but it could have been great.",Eragon
295,selstad84,Not bad but can be improved,5,12 June 2008,"The worst part of this movie is that it don't follow the book to good. So that drags down much for those loving the books and want a good movie out of it.But as a movie this ain't the worst i have seen. There are things that can be improved, like getting more life to the world, better acting and not rushing forward all the time but its not the worst i have seen.The dragon, Saphira, is worth it alone because she is doing the job perfectly. I don't expect the other actors like Speelers. This is after all he's first movie and is doing a good work for being the first one. Many other actors like the actors of Harry Potter, didn't do the best of acting in they're first movie (Daniel Radcliff, Emma Watson, Rubert Grint) but they have grown with the role and are now doing a fairly good job. So give him a Chance.The only thing that drags most down in this movie is the constant trying to be Lord of the Rings. Durza's speech before the war was almost word taken from Sarumans speech in ""The two towers"".All in all, this is a movie with potentials. I think they should make a sequel, add up in the intro the main important parts they left out in the first movie and follow the book. Doing so i think we have a movie that can compeat with Lord of the Rings and Narnia. What made those movie good was the directors respect for the original work.Worth seeing though, as a movie.",Eragon
296,IcePhoenix101,Loosely based on the book,7,13 July 2007,"Despite disappointing most of the fans of the book, I (a fan as well) have to say the movie was not bad at all. The special effects were great, and Saphira looked marvellous (though she looks a bit like a bird).The main complaint that most people have (and I) is that it wasn't true to the book and that was too short (about 1 hr 30 mins). Different events happened for different reasons (Brom and Eragon originally left Carvahall to search for the Ra'zac, not to escape from them) and at different places (Eragon originally met Angela in Teirm, not in Daret) and some characters look different from their descriptions in the book (Eragon has brown hair, not blond hair, Brom has a full beard and Saphira has translucent wings, not feathered wings, Arya has black hair, not red hair, and the list goes on...). Some characters aren't supposed to appear (Galbatorix) and some characters aren't featured at all (Katrina, The Twins and the lovable dwarf Orik). Even Arya is supposed to be an elf and it is only mentioned that she is a princess of Ellesmera in the second book, Eldest. Considering all that, I'd say the movie was loosely based on the book and was more suited to the director's imagination.There's been talk of a sequel, Eldest. Well, if it does go into production, the screenwriter better make up for some major events which had an impact on the plot later, such as Eragon's scar. I hope it will be better and stay true to the book.But what's even better is if they do a re-make that is aimed at the fans and can still keep a reasonable pace. The interests of the fans are the most important and make up most of the audience and thus, most of the reviews, the money and ultimately the success of the film.Overall, it's alright, but it definitely could be much better.",Eragon
297,a-papke,Worst Directed Movie Ever?,3,18 December 2006,"Unlike most of the people who hate this film, I have not read the book, so I can hate this film purely on its own merits. This movie has everything and squanders it all: a powerhouse cast of internationally acclaimed actors, a gorgeous new lead actor, knockout special effects, a snappy pace and a fascinating fantasy premise; but it is completely wasted on a director with absolutely no imagination of how to convey the magic of the fantasy genre or where to place a camera - and especially no idea how to direct a cast of real actors. This movie really makes one appreciate the genius of Peter Jackson who knows that film is a visual medium where the camera is most important storyteller, even when you have a three hundred million dollar budget. A mountain of money can't save a film from sucking when the director can't capture mood or character. Someone should have told director Fangmeir that a movie is more than just a collection of a thousand crane shots, flying shots, dolly tracks and visual effects. None of that will add up to a squirt of hobbit pee if they don't further the plot, characters or theme. For example: Yeah, the dragon looks cool, but it fails to evoke any feeling or meaning other than ""Wow, that's a really neat looking dragon."" We are told there is a spiritual connection between Eragon and the dragon, but we never FEEL the connection for ourselves. (Check out ET if you want to see how this is done by a real master.) We are told the dragon is a reflection of Eragon's latent majestic inner power. But in the hands of Fangmeir, the dragon represents nothing more than a boy's new toy, a cute little puppy at first and a reptilian jet-fighter at the end; all the while, Eragon remains unchanged from start to finish. He stands the same, talks the same, behaves the same and looks the same through his entire arc. Movie magic is more than just CGI effects and lighting. It comes from the actor's eyes, but Fangmeir wouldn't know anything about that. Also, there are plot holes galore such that any believability is totally destroyed. Nothing makes any sense by the time the movie builds up to the final climax. Of course things had to be cut from the book, but from the reviews of people who have read it, this is not a faithful adaptation; so this is no excuse for plot holes. One changes things from the book so that there ARE not plot holes in the film. Fangmeir has done a great disservice to fans of the book and lovers of fantasy films in general.Lucky for this film, the charisma of the main actor Edward Speleers is phenomenal. He's the only reason I'm rating this film higher than a one out of ten. I would love to see what he could do in the hands of a real director.",Eragon
298,Falcon07,The scenery & effects in the movie are spectacular,3,22 November 2007,"Was disappointed with this movie. I like this genre and thought with the cast including John,Jeremy & Robert would make it one to remember. Unfortunately it reminded me not to ever watch it again. Not because of the acting, that was played to its best, even though the boy was a bit wooden.To be honest I think it was the script which let the actors down. Its a real shame when you see poor dialogue with well known actors. Do they not realise what their getting themselves into when they first read the script ! The special effects were convincing and I loved when the dragon finally blew fire ! However as we all know its not just the special effects & actors which make a movie. The movie didn't grip you and all of a sudden they had rescued the lady & killed the bad guy. By the looks of it we're set for a 2nd one with big John releasing his T-Rex, lets hope the script is better.",Eragon

If we look at this movie as a movie, as an original idea, then it is meh. The movie is rushed, the acting is sub par, I hear that Wiez does the best acting, however, I do not view what she did as acting in itself, granted her performance added a nice effect to the dragon, which was the best part of the movie, but, there are some performances we must acknowledge. Irons and Malcovich did their best with what they were given, not much. This, I blame on the director. Also on the script writers.All in all, the movie is horrid.

And to my surprise, it got trashed...After that I never got around to seeing it because if its that bad why should I sit through ANOTHER horrible film? I finally picked it up used on DVD pretty cheap because I was always curious... Again to my surprise, People were wrong. This is a good flick! Not great. Corny? A bit. But what FAMILY flick isn't? I've seen A LOT worse (I'm sure you have also). That's just it, its a FAMILY film. Not ""Your Precious"" Lord Of The Rings. Not The Godfather.

301,mystic-writing,"OK, but needs work",7,16 December 2006,"OK, I am a huge fan of the series, so i was really looking forward to the movie; me and my friend went to see the afternoon showing of the movie on the day it came out, walking into a full theater. Good-we're not the only fans of the book.The first few minutes were good. A god explanation of the history and 'background' of the movie. The angle of the camera, on the back of a dragon, for the first few moments were good.Then come in mighty hunter Eragon, traveling the Spine in search of food for his family. i personally think his acting was a bit odd; and the area around him was totally off the story description. Finally, he got the egg and returned to his village. typical for the first few moments.A lot-repeat, a lot- of things were taken out of the movie that was shown clearly in the book; it seemed, when Saphira was hatched, Eragon showed no... surprise, when he saw the dragon. He wasn't cautious, just a bit excited, not at all nervous.Then Saphira grew too rapidly-i think it would of been better of they kinda showed her growth spurt. Eragon was trying to get her to fly, and she flew into the sky; then, just a moment later, she returned, as big as an oak tree, and speaking for the first time way too late. Eragon wasn't even wearing different clothing; it looked like she grew rapidly in just a few hours. but i have to say the CGI was excellent.then, a lot of major cities were cut out. Brom died for the wrong reason, Saphira blew fire way too early, major characters only got a moment of screen time, and the journey through the vast countryside was way too short. Arya was awake during the wrong periods of time, and they didn't even show the secret of Murtagh-who we only got to know for a few spared minutes- until it was revealed at the Varden.I am so sorry, but this movie is a disappointment. The fighting and flying scenes are intense, and very good, but otherwise, ti went by all too quickly. This, otherwise, would of been probably been he best movie, even an Oscar.",Eragon

Like this movie, I generally just go along with the group who wants to see them.That said, I had no expectations for this movie. When I saw that the theater previews before the movie were for kid's movies, I knew not to expect much. But when the movie came on I found a satisfactory amount of concern with the characters and interest in outcome. I was entertained. Not blown away . . . but entertained. Believe me, I've seen much worse.The worst thing I can say is that it left me with a lot of questions about the background of the characters . . . but that was explained away by the OBVIOUS hint that there will be a sequel.Maybe I'll check out the book.

I pity fans of the book who will flock in hoping to see the fantasy beauty that was read, mutilated. The acting was the worst, and driest i've seen. The landscapes where rather badly made, or bad cgi that you could tell was not real. My advice is to read the wonderful fantasy written than see it.

306,arosedec,It's alright....,4,17 December 2006,"First things first, I have never read the book therefore I am merely commenting on the film itself and not its relation to the book. After having been spoiled by Peter Jackson and his treatment of The Lord of the Rings, the bar has been raised for epic fantasy films. That being said, Eragon does not even come close in that area. All of the characters feel incredibly superficial and the only inspired performance is that of Jeremy Irons. While I love John Malkovich and think he's a wonderful actor, I felt like he was just going through the motions and not really giving it his all. Edward Speleers did give a nice performance but there was no real progression in the character  his performance did not indicate any growth in the character, he was exactly the same as when the story started. In all fairness, the performance issues could be the result of poor directing and a so-so screenplay. Actors can only do so much with what they're given. The film was lacking in any emotion, I did not care what happened to the characters  except maybe for the dragon which was cg. Eragon did not feel like a feature film  it felt more like a SciFi channel original movie. That being said, I'm not upset that I spent the money to see it (although I'm glad that I was able to get a student ticket) however, like the acting performances  I was uninspired.",Eragon

Most of them were a good character choice. I think it was ed's first time being in a movie and it was not bad for the first time although he has LOTS of room for improvement. I think Brom's character was brilliant. I didn't like Saphira's voice although I think that, Rachel's voice was the voice that Paolini was aiming for. The absolutely worst part was Arya and Angela. They were horrible casts! Neither of them can act.. it was just horrible. Im sorry if I'm offending everybody but its me opinion strictly.

308,AntiSpielbergForce,I suffer without my stone!,1,23 December 2008,"I will not delve too deeply into the derivative nature of the plot, as that has been done already, but I do feel that this movie must be destroyed, hence this lengthy review.First, a word on the acting:Jeremy Irons is the only good actor here. He plays the mentor with a past, and really struggles with the material. You can tell that he feels that this is beneath him, and must have been well paid to keep a straight face (or absent mind) while speaking line after line of cretinous gibberish. His character dies somewhere in the middle, effectively ending what little potential this movie had left in it at that point.John Malkovich, as the evil King Galbatorix, delivers one of my favourite pieces of bad acting of all time. He's only on-screen for about one minute in total, playing the only role he can (a bizarre hybrid of the overstated and monotonous). He utters the first line of dialogue in the entire movie - the hilarious and clueless ""I suffer without my stone. Do not prolong my suffering."" - with such hyperbole that it echoes through the rest of the movie. Now, I don't consider him a good actor by any standard, but the melodrama with which he delivers this line makes me wonder if there isn't more than meets the eye here, and he was actually openly mocking the source material.Nobody else is worth mentioning. The hero is best fit for starry-eyed teen drama, and the voice acting (the whole selling point of the movie being a pretty CGI dragon) is just voice acting. Robert Carlyle's (who usually is decent) evil wizard was just cartoon trash.Anyway, the fact that Malko's suffering is the most memorable scene in the entire movie speaks volumes about the low quality of the material itself. All the clichés of speculative fiction are here. I could usually finish each scene (often the dialogue as well) in my head, because I've seen them so many time before. Never so incompetently directed, though.Most of the movie consists of the hero, mentor and dragon traveling through random pieces of landscape. Can't have a fantasy tale without traveling. Forests, crop fields, valleys, mountains. Mentor offers sage advice, bonds with hero, dies redeeming himself. Hero bonds with dragon, learns his true potential. Final battle. There's a love interest in here too, who spends most the movie lying down, speaking to ""our hero"" through his dreams.The filmmakers actually spent more reel-time and orchestral dollars on setting up the sequel (""We'll meet again, lover"", ""Galbatorix suffers now, but is rebuilding the death star"", etc.) than wrapping up THIS movie with a memorable climax. Or a story at all, really. I could write for hours about all the things this movie isn't.Speaking of the final battle, it epitomizes the incompetence of the narrative. Nowhere in the movie is the scope of the battle hinted at. There are brief scenes of Robert Carlyle's character reprimanding Orc commanders (complete with a shameless frame-by-frame re-shooting of the ""You have failed me for the last time, admiral"" scene from ""The empire strikes back"") - and himself being reprimanded by King Galbatorix, the sufferer - but nowhere do you feel that there is a large task force on our hero's trail. Apparently there is, as the rebels all mount for war at Helm's Deep at the end of the movie.However, as there is no sense of neither place nor politics in the entire movie, it ultimately doesn't matter where this takes place, why it takes place, who participates, and how many they are. I couldn't even tell you who these bad guys are, as they are at best mentioned in passing (""Watch out for Razacs while collecting that there firewood, Eragon!""). There really isn't any narrative or back-story here at all, save for some tidbits about the dragons. But since the supposed significance of the dragons is not tied to a larger political and cultural scope, their history becomes as meaningless as everything else. There is minimal character development, so the human aspect is also superficial.Something about the author of this work:I have not read the book and have no intention of ever doing so. But, I think I have a grasp of what's going on.Names and invocations are nothing more than random Scandinavian or Celtic-sounding words, and the plot points are lifted from other people's work. This is the product of someone with only book experience and no mileage of his own (i.e. a nerd). And like many sci-fi writers who give their characters ""spacey"" names - for no other reason than to remind the reader that the story takes place in the future - the characters here have ""fantastic"" names, just to remind the reader/viewer that it's fantasy. A long time ago. Far...far away.Christ, this is so bad.Judging by the derivative nature of this material, I doubt people will hear about the Eragon franchise in the future. Longevity is perhaps the only accurate measurement of quality in art. Quality survives. Speaking only for the movie, it's quite clear that it was thrown together hastily, while the book is still hot stuff, to make some quick cash on the name. If they make a new Eragon movie in 20 years, then maybe I'll believe that the material itself has some lasting merit.Anyway, at 1:40, or something, at least this nasty movie takes its own advice and does not ""prolong the suffering"". However, we can always keep hoping for an ""extended version"" to surface in time for the sequel, featuring the deleted scenes of Jeremy Irons chasing his agent through the nine circles of Hell, and King Galbatorix suffering without his stone on the Tree of Woe.No stars for Christmas.",Eragon
309,realyslow,I was surprised,7,15 December 2006,"Many times i have went home from movies so disappointed, so actually i didn't have any thought of it. Just to avoid disappointment. Well its a pleasant surprise this movie, i liked it a lot and this might be a very good trilogy, If u are like me a fan of sorcery's and witchcraft and dragons, its a must to c it, i brought my 13 year old son to it as well and also he was thrilled about it.I have just watched the harry potter movie with this director before and want to see more in the future of him. The actors played pretty well, well i admit that Eragon could be a another person, but he played pretty well so i leave it with that. So i highly recommend this flick to ya out there, but don't expect a new fellowship of the ring thing, cause that the best of the best.",Eragon

Honestly you can't blame the cast of characters for this movie its starts on top with the director. Who was this person Stephen whats his name? The movie did not go by the book but what movie doesn't go by the novel when they are copying from it. Here is my in take on what Fox 2000 Pictures should do. Fire the producer, the writer, and the director go out and get Jerry Bruckhiemer let him hire the director and the writer. When watching the movie I could see so much potential of what this movie is capable of producing. I liked this movie but not enough to give it a rating of which I know it should've gotten if only there had been a better director and a better writer. because in most cases a good damn script can bring out the best in an actor.",Eragon

(1) Eragon learns to say Brisingr and after this is an accomplished spell-caster. (2) Eragon is a blond, in the book he's got dark hair! (3) Arya seems to find Eragon pleasant but in the book she is cold and avoids him. (4) Eragon didn't defeat Durza by himself, he had help from Arya and Saphira who break the dwarf star sapphire. (5)Durza doesn't conjure a dragon. (6)Where are Arya's pointed ears? She's an elf! There are so many inconsistencies it becomes a pain to watch.

312,Kaytee23,Good but people are making too big of a sour deal,9,30 December 2006,"After seeing the movie twice, I can honestly say it was a 9 out of 10. People seem to be making a huge deal because the movie is so different from the book, which it is. But personally I always feel that when you go to see a movie based off of a book, you need to forget about the book and just enjoy the movie. Otherwise you're bound to find little things here and there.When I saw the movie for the first time I didn't fully enjoy it. I was extremely disappointed with everything they had cut and changed. Then my younger sister saw it again and told me it was better the second time. I had a friend who wanted to see it so we went together and my sister was right. The second time, since I knew how different it was, I was able to sit back and enjoy it.Another thing that is bothering me is how everyone says that Ed Speleers is a terrible actor. Now, even though I'm 17 and think he's extremely good-looking, I am not biased when I say he's a good actor. Sure he hasn't had a lot of experience (and maybe his one crying scene was a little lame) but honestly, the kid's a good actor. He carries along the film very well. The only thing I thought which might have made him seem lacking was his dialogue and then that's not really his fault.I am a true book fan, having read both Eragon and Eldest twice long before the movie was even announced, but honestly, to really judge the movie you need to forget about the book, pretend it never existed, and enjoy the movie.~*~Kally~*~",Eragon
313,turin0016,80's Fantasy made twenty years later,6,2 November 2007,"Eragon is a fun movie. That's probably the most succinct description I can give of what you'll get out of it. Don't go in looking for great substance, or acting (other than Irons, who as always does fantastically even with almost nothing of merit in his script), or writing. Go in expecting lots of pretty light shows and special effects, some decent battle sequences, and some eye candy for men and women both.If you're old enough to remember the glut of fantasy-oriented movies in the 80s, that's what Eragon is. Not a whole lot to it, but it doesn't try too hard or go ""beyond itself."" A popcorn movie, or one to watch on a rainy Saturday with some donuts and coffee.Really, the movie is exactly what the book was - derivative, predictable, though not BAD, fantasy that you'll blitz through in a few hours and promptly forget. The books were so heavily hyped primarily due to the young age of the author (and I'll admit, for a 17-year old kid, it's pretty decent writing) and the fact that they were fantasy novels that didn't utterly suck.Moral of the story - sit down, turn off your brain, and just have some fun. That's what you paid for, that's what you get. Movie studios could actually do to emulate this sort of production. The rash of 160-minute self-important movies can really stop now.",Eragon
314,ProudSonOfNewJersey,Loosen Up and Enjoy! My Wife & I Loved It!,8,2 June 2009,"The only reason that I gave it 8 out of 10 was the ending. It was only after turning to IMDb that I found out the movie was based on a book series. I can only hope there will be a sequel so that I can see how it ends. It seems that most folks don't like the movie because it wasn't faithful to the book. That happens a lot. I read John Grisham's ""A Time to Kill"", and got sick when the movie came out. So, I can relate to the book fans, but on its own, I just loved the movie. Amazing scenery, good fight scenes, real good special effects, a classic good vs evil theme, an evil wizard...jeez, who could ask for more? I guess I'm not as astute as some of the other reviewers, as I didn't notice any bad acting. I was totally wrapped up in the movie. Now I'm inspired to read the book series.",Eragon
315,Birstyjr,"Good actors, Good special effects, Bad writing.",6,15 December 2006,"The movie follows nothing of the book's plot line. I think someone read like maybe ten chapters of the Eragon book and decided to make the movie. If they decide to make Eldest (The sequel to Eragon) it would be nothing like the book because they have changed too many things in this movie to carry the plot correctly. The plot of the movie shares nothing with the book and the characters (the ones they actually decided to add) share no similarities to the book's idea of them. The storyline used in the movie could have possibly been acceptable if it hadn't had such bad writing. The lines were mediocre and no one other than Brom, Eragon and Saphira had ten lines. Murtagh had like eight or nine lines through the whole movie, Nasuada and Ajihad had like two or three (and Nasuada doesn't say who she is) and Hrothgar had maybe one or two lines. They completely rushed the movie too quickly. Unless you read the book, you have no idea how Eragon learns to use magic and are left in the dark about most things. The actors did the best job they could with the horrid lines they were given to read. The special effects were great except that Saphira isn't supposed to have feathers. What dragon has feathers? Christopher Paolini says like fifty times in the book that Saphira's wings are a thin membrane. Also that Eragon is fifteen, not seventeen. Every problem comes back to the horrid writing. Bottom Line: Could have been a great and timeless movie. Not Lord of the Rings worthy.",Eragon

The book was written aimed more at adults true, and as with every single film I have ever seen, the book is better. Any comparison of any film to a book its based will have the book fans complaining. But I enjoyed it and I've read the books. Went with no preformed ideas of how the film should look based on the book. I viewed it simply as a kids film about a boy and his dragon.

I heard much about this film, before I first saw it, and I thought the whole time; ""This can't be as bad as everyone says it is!"" But then I saw it. WTF! This is just heartbreaking to live through. From the first second, it was just so uninteresting that I became terrified. ""When is something going to happened? ..or is something going to happened at all..?"" I'm serious when I tell you, I fell asleep before anything happened. Lucky me I got the movie on the computer, and could what the ending again. But I wasn't impressed there either. The film lost me long time ago, there wasn't any hope left, if you was left, to watch the whole movie.It is just bad. Ed Speleers, Jeremy Irons, Robert Carlyle.. everyone did a weak impression at me.

The Screenplay was the worst adaptation of a book's story line I have ever seen I was just so disappointed by the fact that they just did not stick with the beautiful Story that Paolini has created.Let alone the fact that the movie had no flow, you can't understand the story at all (for example that Eragon suddenly learns words from the ancient language that he has never heard before, and all of a sudden he is an able swordsman when in the book it took him months) and WHY may I ask WHY did they invent such stupid ""new"" words in the ancient language when it took Paolini so long to invent a new unique one,I imagine what it was like for people that have not read the book.Now lets talk about the acting, CRAP from the most part of the actors, poor Jeremy Irons seemed to be put in a world he did not understand rather than being a former dragon Rider Himself. No DWARFS !? its an Abomination, WHY WHY the hell did they do that, I could not wait to get out of the theater and tell people how Horrible This Movie Was, They ruined a great story just so they could sell Toys and Videogames, Here you have a chance to do a great movie (From a Wonderful Book I might add) and you all Blew it.The Soundtrack deserves one word ""CRAP"" the music sounded like they copy and pasted leftover songs from LOTR, Star Wars or any other ""epic"" movie. I will quit wasting time insulting the movie. and instead I will give you the reason I give it a 5 out of 10 and not one,although the movie left me dead inside I Love the first two books Paolini wrote (Eragon and Eldest), this movie deserves more because its part of a great story (altough the people at FOX failed to bring this story to life) I really hope if they make Eldest they will do a better job and try harder. Read the Book I Beg all of you who haven't READ THE BOOK!! This Movie Sucked not because it was a ""bad"" movie but because its a bad Adaptation of a Great Story.

It wasn't too bad. I had expected more, but I wasn't as deterred as some of the others grading this movie. And while I was more upset by changes to the story in this movie than any other I've seen to date, all in all, I enjoyed it. And I could have even enjoyed it more if they had STUCK TO THE STORY, at least more than 40%-50% of the time, and that's a generous estimate. Also, an hour and a half was too short to condense the book into, just a half hour more could have done wonders for this film. I did notice the sections of questionable acting, but they were no worse than some I saw in SW episode III. Special effects were great. My hope now is that if they don't change directors, the current one will learn from his mistakes and keep the reviews of Eragon in mind, and make Eldest and Empire great final films for this excellent trilogy.",Eragon
320,dodo1066,A terrible shame!,3,23 May 2007,"Unfortunately, having enjoyed reading the book, i was disappointed in the movie. Even from the very start of the film the quality of the script was shown up,. A particularly feeble performance from Ed Speelers, who looked nothing like a farmer boy, but did act like one, didn't help, but mainly the script was what let the film down. The stereotypical bad guys, who despite being surrounded by so much 'scary' fire all the time, looked almost comical, and had lines to match.The CGI was fine, but nothing special, and not much care had been taken with the costumes and the soundtrack. That was disappointing. So was the battle scene, which was farcical, and again, they tried to cram too much battle into too short a scene, despite the fact that they managed to give Eragon plenty of time to have philosophical conversations with his dragon, played excellently by Rachel Weisz.The only thing i can say in defence of the movie was that there is so much material in the book, and so much is needed to improve and expand on the characters in the book, that the directors had to cut a lot. However the job they did was feeble and so was the film.But the real question is; can they correct the mess they've made with a good sequel?

321,dennisvansant,Legendary fantasy novel turns into run-of-the-mill snore-fest,3,27 November 2007,"I have just finished watching this movie, and a few things mustn't remain unsaid about it. Firstly, I have not read the book and was not in any way familiar with the mythology before I watched the film, so I think I can be quite objective about the film storyline as a whole. The character building was simply terrible. None of the characters as they are portrayed in the film look in the least bit interesting, which made the story all the less compelling (for one, I basically would not think twice about it if everyone was killed in a flash and the final credits began to roll). The entire way in which the story is told makes everything look way too easy and except for maybe a few moments in the final battle, there's hardly any real feeling of 'threat' in the storyline, because you know full well that no matter how many Raz'Aks lay siege to our heroes, there could always be a huge dragon that casually flies in and burns or freezes everyone to a crisp. Casting was terrible as well (Joss Stone as a fortune teller that didn't even bother taking out her modern-day nose ring?!), and this movie practically reminded me of ""Dungeons & Dragons"" all the time, which is definitely NOT a good thing. Only noteworthy character is Brom, who they of course had to kill off soon enough to turn this movie into a total bloody (pardon my French) disaster. 3/10 for the nice CGI and Jeremy Irons as Brom, and obviously not waiting for the sequel that is suggested at the end...",Eragon

Basically, the plot was unoriginal and stupid.Second, the duologue was just cheesy. I'm talking gooey nacho cheese melting all over the movie. Enough said. I gotta go get some of that cheese..yummy...Third, there was ABSOLUTELY NO CHARACTER DEVELOPENT. OK, suddenly we gotta go save a princess? And when we do she's suddenly a good friend of ""our"" hero? Then when that guy dies, I forgot his name(hehe) it's like, ""um, who cares?"" you never get to know any of the characters.

Other than thinking that the screenwriter borrowed every major plot point from Star Wars I thought the cinematography and CG were good. Jeremy Irons was good and John Malkovich was creepy despite the mailed in performance as Galbatorix.

When I tell you I'd rather sit through Ultraviolet or Aeon Flux again, that should give you some measure of what I mean by 'bad'.Anyway, I never read the book (which by all accounts has no bearing on the film anyway), so here's my take on the plot...The legitimate ruler of a Kingdom is facing a political and military crisis. Neighbouring (rogue) states conspire against his rule, fomenting trouble. Naturally, to preserve freedom, some sacrifices must be made and the rule of law must prevail.Enter the main character, a young idealist who gets caught up in the intrigue when a Weapon of Mass Destruction, stolen from the King's armoury falls into his possession. Abetted by a grizzled traitor, they seek to deliver the WMD to one of the neighbouring states where the terrorists have their haven.The King, quite naturally, sends his troops to the distant land to wage his War on Terror and to locate the missing WMD and, well, stuff happens.But none of it is remotely interesting so I won't bore you with the details.

I don't know whats in store for the rest of the trilogy or if they'll even have a trilogy since many critics shot down this movie and usually that doesn't tend to be good for a sequel, but i enjoyed the movie, wasn't the best movie I've ever seen but it definitely wasn't the worst either, far from it. It had an interesting plot albeit not executed well, which is the only problem i have with it, had a good set of visuals which greatly contributed to the action and the setting of the movie.

I was disappointed that even the main character Eragon was all wrong, all the more disappointed to see Arya and the fortune teller are different too compared to the books.

The dragon has feathers... it was just bizarre and made it look more like a giant blue rooster. The lead who played Eragon had a great face and did a fine job along with all the other actors... Though how does a director miss the whole caste having thick British accents then along comes the dark haired kid who sound like he's from a mall in Santa Monica, California? Way too much magic in this too! No body can be hurt or in danger when you can just pull a fireball out of your you know what. John Malcovich was in this movie for like 5 minutes. They should have gotten rid of the Dr. Evil wizard and has the king, John Malcovich the enemy the whole time... anyone see In the Line of Fire?

It is a very massive rip-off of LOTR and Star Wars (but everyone already knows that); yet it does have a certain level of charm, and the last quarter of the film is quite exciting.There are several problems with ERAGON, and most of them have nothing at all to do with the action or screenplay. If anything, it feels that at least 45 mins of the movie is missing. The story moves ahead far too quickly and doesn't explain anything deeply enough.ERAGON could have used better editing and much stronger character development. Too many people are rushed in and out of the story without really explaining who they are and why they are important. I had a feeling that the best parts of the movie were most likely cut out for time restrictions (often kiddie type films are shaved down to be as short as possible to fit in as many showings in one day as possible for theatres and the studios).Many movies are killed this way. ERAGON was definitely harmed by having so much of the story cut out -- and as someone who read the first book and seen the movie, they cut out way too much and there is much that should have definitely been in there.In any case, this is a good flick for TEENAGERS who enjoy heroic fantasy.",Eragon

Eragon is that little farm boy (just like Luke Skywalker) who lives with his uncle on a desolate farmland (just like Luke Skywalker) and it turns out that he must fight against an evil empire (just like Luke Skywalker) and defeat an evil slave to a king (Darth Vadar and Emperor Palpatine) but I did enjoy it despite the obvious relevance to the classic 70's epic, the dragon was awesome and John Malkovich (despite having a rather small part for such an A-list actor) was convincing as the evil king.

B: The final fight with Durza involved a huge rose colored crystal falling from the ceiling, distracting Durza, and Eragon striking the killing blow. Where's the crystal? In fact, where's the ceiling? Could've sworn this battle was inside a cavern! C: Eragon spends half the second book recovering and dealing with a grievious wound that Durza tears across his back. In the movie, he never even gets slapped, much less severely wounded by Durza. D: Saphira doesn't come out knowing her name already! Eragon has a quick conversation with Brom and choses the name from a list.These are in addition to the things that you take for granted in a book to movie translation anyway, like them speeding up the growth of Saphira for time restraints.

The trailer promised enough that I was glad to take my sons and daughter to see it. As others have noted, it's kind of a Star Wars: A New Hope meets Lord of the Rings type of movie. And since the original novel WAS written by a KID, I think we can forgive a lot of the bad writing and awkward, cheesy fantasy names. Additionally, it starred a newcomer and I believe the director may not have been directing before this. The star, Edward Speelers, who plays the hero, does a decent job - I'm not going to fault him much for his first big role - but it's not Oscar stuff.As for the professionals, Jeremy Irons, a favorite artist of mine, is at his most forgettable. Djimon Honsou is terribly miscast - or maybe just not trying - in his role as ""rebel alliance"" leader.And then there's John Malkovich, whom I find always bad in period pieces (God in Heaven, have any of seen him in the Man in the Iron Mask movie?); well, I think this celebrated actor has hit bottom here. But it's not all his fault. His charactyer is Galbatorix (part Emperor Galba and part Vercingetorix, I guess?), a dark and sinister king; and his very first line, uttered from his dark throne is, ""I suffer without my stone...."" It should be hilarious, but I was just embarrassed, for actor, audience, everybody. Phew. And I have to ask a question: In terms of fantasy movies, why doesn't the old Oliver Stone movie called ""Conan"" (a Hollywood STONE, if you will, one that a viewer suffers WITH) get an equal amount of heat from viewers? It is by far a worse film, yet somehow its faults are forgiven by most reviewers - perhaps because they hate the content, and see the vomitous movie as revenge on fantasy films in general.... But, to return to Eragon, the movie seems to be getting panned right and left, basically for falling short of what it might have been. Admitted. Yet Eragon, not a classic by anyone's standards, is still a passable fantasy movie for the younger set. John Knighton",Eragon

This movie, to put it blunt, Christopher Paolini needs to get some agents like Lucas Arts has, to keep people from bashing his story.That is sound advice people.On the upside, the movie does reveal enough about the story to motivate you to read the books. The only real horrible part of the movie I guess is John Malkovich. Having his image stuck in you mind while trying to read the novels is hideous.",Eragon
336,JamesFord92,Disappointing Fantasy Film,4,16 December 2006,"Following Eragon's first incarnation, as an excellent fantasy novel, this film version is very disappointing. It is easily apparent that first time director Stefen Fangmeier's background is in visual effects, as that is all the film focuses on doing right. The effects are, for the most part, excellent, and the dragon is brought to life very impressively. Everything else though, it seems, was laid by the wayside. The film starts off introducing us to the land of Alagaesia, a middle earth-esquire land, ruled by an evil empire and it's ruler Galbatorix(John Malkovich). The story gets going right away, as Eragon(Edward Speelers) finds a magical stone, which from soon appears a baby dragon. Eragon soon learns of his destiny, to become a legendary Dragon Rider, alongside his dragon Saphira(voiced by Rachel Weisz). After his uncle is killed, Eragon, along with his mentor Brom(Jeremy Irons), must avoid the enemies trying to kill him, while saving a beautiful elf, and making his way to the Varden, a small group of resistance fighters, who need Eragon in their battle against the Empire. Most of the blame for the failings of this movie rests squarely on the shoulders of the director and screenwriter. Neither of these two men seem to know the meaning of character development, as the movie rushes by so quickly that all of the characters, other than Eragon and his dragon, are completely underused and wasted. Speaking of rushing by, the film, at a short time of 104 minutes, jumps from place to place so quickly that it can barely stop to breath. To account for the long plot line in the book, as well as in any fantasy epic(Narnia: 143 min; Lord of the Rings: 178 min), it should have been at least half an hour longer, giving it time to slow down a bit, and for you to get attached to the characters. The film is also filled with plenty of plot holes and some wooden dialogue. Not everything is bad though, as Jeremy Irons manages to give a good performance, with what he is given, and Robert Carlyle is suitably creepy as the evil magic-wielding Durza. Overall though, Eragon falls flat. The book might have been a Lord of the Rings/Star Wars rip off, but at least it was a good one, this film however, is not.",Eragon
337,theaubrey,Really? Who decided this was good?,3,26 May 2007,"Who ever okayed this project was clearly not having an ""on"" day to say the least. The book was relatively entertaining, but the movie wasn't, it did not hold my attention at all, and even Hilary Duff movies mildly hold my attention.The special effects are in no way something to brag about. Ed Speleers was not convincing as a major action hero, there is a lack of maturity to his acting.Another downfall to the movie is that it is so disjointed you need to have read the book to understand what is going on, and even then you know just enough to go ""What just happened?"" Save your money, and use it instead to go buy the book, you will be much better of. And then if you still want to see the movie, just imagine the book really disjointed, and a million times worse.",Eragon
338,tashwat,"If you're a fan of the books, stay away from this film",4,18 March 2014,"I am a huge fan of the Inheritance Cycle and was eager yet a little wary when I heard they were making the film adaptation. Then when the cast list came out, my expectations about it's success were lifted with such names as Jeremy Irons, John Malkovich, Robert Carlyle and Rachel Weisz carrying the film. I thought if they were to bring the level of Peter Jackson's Lord of the Rings trilogy to the film, then they would pay fair homage to the books. However, it was nowhere near they level of epic storytelling it needed to be to make it a success. I felt the whole film was deflated and the only decent credit I could give was Saphira the dragon. I felt as if they had spent all their time and money perfecting her CG character but gave little to the rest of the entire film. John Malkovich gave a very flat and run-of-the-mill performance as King Galbatorix and the lead was equally flat. Sadly this is another example, like many before, where a film seems to rely on it's A-list cast and digital effects to make it a success.Unfortunately, it was poorly written and poorly directed - a recipe for failure.",Eragon

They try to compare it to Lord of the Rings, but Eragon is more a children novel and the movie shows it. I do have to agree that it should have been a little longer so that the scenes could meld together better, but it was a good entertaining intro to a trilogy. The special effects were great. I enjoyed the 1st time lead actor, its good to get a new face for a new film. Look at Harry Potter, new face brought millions.

341,lucanolasco,As a fantasy lover...,3,18 December 2006,"I am usually easy, and I love fantasy, but not this! The problem, by me, starts with the book. The story in the book was OK, but the book itself is badly, very badly written. Paolini is (was) a young rough writer, inexperienced, naive, silly some time, who has good fantasy but no skills to shape them. How can something good come out of that? Indeed the film is just what i expected: a lot of good intention but a very bad result. The story is full of gaps and holes resulting in the storyline that is not clear at all. Even the big names do not add anything to the film (I guess they are there just to pull audience). The effect were good, but today a good team and software can make a lot with little. I am very sorry they made such a bad film, I had hope, I want to be entertained, I want the dream, they could have improved the bad book, but they followed it in the mediocrity. In general it is just a money maker... I hope little money. Do not go to see it, it is a waste of money and time.",Eragon
342,UnicornMaiden,The dragon was the best part,6,14 January 2007,"Eragon essentially took a good book and made a bad movie. Speleers and Irons both gave good performances, but the characters were all flat and shallow, as opposed to the strong, well-rounded characters developed in the book. Arya went from butt-kicking warrior to prissy little princess. Angela went from mystical old sorceress to fortune-telling hooker. Durza went from a guy who would rip out your throat and smile to the king's cowering minion. Brom went from wise and mysterious to crabby old guy who should be yelling at kids to get off his lawn.Most of the back story was cut, some of it very important to the plot. It seemed as though they couldn't be bothered to tell viewers the history and details. They were too busy jumping from one fight scene to the next.Speaking of fight scenes, they were all sub-par. No matter how many bad guys the sword slashes, it never seems to get any blood on it. The characters spend quite a bit of dialogue on how fierce and deadly the enemies are, but when they actually fight the bad guys have all the combat skills of steamed broccoli.The only truly spectacular part of the movie was Saphira, the dragon. The character was virtually unchanged from the book, and Rachel Weisz gave a superb voice performance. The visual effects creating Saphira were excellent, and the flying scenes were enough to take your breath away.My advice? See it for the dragon.",Eragon
343,Guffinator2003,Someone should be ashamed,2,29 April 2007,"I took the pleasure of reading the book prior to the movie. Actually I purposely held off from seeing the flick until I completed the book. I can't really add anything other then what I've already read dozens of times in previous post, but I feel the need to make my statement.This movie follows about 10% of the book, if that. It follows the basic premise of the story, but is pretty much a total re-write of the story. Many key parts are left out, or altered to fit into a condensed version.I understand there are time constraints when going from print to film, but if you are going to totally re-write the book for the big screen why not call it by a different title because after all, this movie was NOT the story of Eragon that I read, it was a totally new fabrication based on a book.While I didn't find the movie to be totally horrible, I find what they did to the story to be simply atrocious.",Eragon
344,RichieRich1,What a big mess,3,29 December 2006,"To all you fantasy fans out there please stay away from this crap. I've read the book and it was amazing and it was hard to believe that it was written by a 15 year old boy. With the right director (and not some loser who before directing this movie did not have any directing experience at all) this movie could have been something great. But you can't blame the director as much as the screen writer who did such a big mess with Paolini's wonderful book.The movie is about a boy who finds a egg, that later turns out to hold a dragon in it. The boy was destined to be a dragon rider and to save mankind from a evil king (who is played by John Malkovich who has 3 scenes in the entire movie). A lot of important characters in the book like Murtagh, Ajihad, Hrothgar and Angela all had very few screen time. The Urgals (this movies Orcs) are described in the book like a cross between men and beast but in the movie they are just big Hungarian men running around trying to do frightening noises.The young British actor playing the role of Eragon is not bad but is not good either. As this was his first role I am not going to be too hard on the guy but they good have found someone better who would have had more experience.The only good things about this movie was the dragon (nice work), Jeremy Irons performance and some nice camera work, but that's pretty much all.So please if you are a fantasy fan like me and loved movies like the Lord of the rings trilogy and the Narnia movie please stay away from this one cause you will only be disappointed.The author is currently writing a trilogy and the second book is named ELDEST but that one will not be filmed (that's for sure) cause this movie (believe me) will not do good at the box office.",Eragon

That sucks too. Oh well. The movie sucked. And I was in a good mood too. A non-thinking persons eye candy. Even the candy in the lobby wasn't this expensive. Where's the beef? Didn't know dragons could be so boring. They should have taken some of R.Welches photos from her 1 million years BC movie and thrown them in to keep the audience interested. This movie was bad.

With Eragon, I was more then disappointed, I was down right offended. There are very few positive things I can say about this film, the screenplay itself was terrible, the writer obviously going for pace rather then focusing on things like character development, dialog and plot. They butchered the novel, leaving out major characters and events, and almost trying to be untrue to the book whenever possible. I understand the need to cut things and change things, but it was like the they read through the book once and said, ""hey, lets just wing it"".The acting was so bad I wanted to cry, with actors picked seemingly for their looks (and by this I mean in no way how much they do or do not look like the characters described in the novel) rather then their ability to...well do anything at all, let alone act. Coupled with the bad dialog, there were times during the film where I just burst out laughing, experiencing moments that could only ever be described as ""competely lame"".This movie seems to be just a Lord of The Rings rip off, rushed through and out of the studios with as little effort and attention to detail payed as possible, all to exploit the buzz that surrounds the Inhertience trilogy and squeeze as much money out of it as they can. Surprise, Surprise, its a Fox Project.All in all, this was a bad interpretation of the novel, and a complete failure as a movie. Save your money, don't see this movie.",Eragon
347,prbach,"""Eragon"" Crowns Peter Jackson King",4,13 December 2006,"What? Peter Jackson wasn't involved with ""Eragon."" Precisely. ""Eragon"" is the latest in the early wake of films following ""LOTR"" to demonstrate Jackson's genius by so completely falling short of it. The folks at New Line just lost a few cool millions in their quixotic efforts to low ball Jackson into directing their planned two-film ""The Hobbit"" series. At this rate New Line will also have to throw down a fiver on a pair of kneepads to prevent bruises while groveling.""Eragon"" suffers from plenty of problems: stilted bland dialogue, characters cut out from Fantasy Film for Dummies, and a predictably rote plot. But its greatest flaw is assuming its target audiencewhich, from its facile storyline, is presumably children whose age is measured in single digitswon't understand the difference between fantasy and reality.The hero, a teen boy aptly named Eragon, must discover his true nature as a dragon rider and the last hope of a poor, abused populace to defeat its evil king. Along his travails he meets the knowing mentor (as played by Jeremy Irons, the only character to avoid one-word characterizations), the mysterious alter-ego lost son, the princess who becomes his inspiration and love interest, and the big ethnic leadership figure (an unfortunately cast Djimon Hounsou) who knowingly lays down arms for our hero.Archetypal figures can be great for a film, but they need a believable existence apart from their characterization. Even young kids can recognize the difference. ""Neverending Story"" and the ""Shrek"" films covered similar territory for the same audience with remarkably richer stories and themes.""Eragon"" is proof positive that it takes more than complicated CGI and monsters (both of which fall short of ""LOTR"" standards, by the way) to craft a good fantasy film. The poor young writer of the novel that forms the basis for ""Eragon,"" Christopher Paolini, hopefully will prevent Fox from messing up his already successful follow up, ""Eldest.""Somebody get Peter Jackson on the phone.

348,the_mole_8472,Enjoyable film on the whole.,7,20 December 2006,"I have heard a lot of reviews for this film, some saying it is good, some saying it is down right awful. But it has dragons in it so I thought I would go and see for myself, which I did last night. Having never read the book (something to remedy I think) I had no preconceptions going into this movie about the story lines or the characters.Others have made reference to the similarities between this film and Star Wars IV. True the similarities are there but in my eyes, this does not detract from the over all enjoyable story line of this film. Also, many have compared some scenes to The Lord Of The Rings. Again, whilst I can see the similarities of the two, I can't help but think that all future fantasy films with large battles in them will suffer the same treatment.Despite the above, this film was pieced together quite nicely I think. The pace was just right so the viewer wouldn't get bored (something that happened a few times in the LotR), but not to fast as to allow the viewer to lose the plot.All in all, I think this is a good film that parents and older children will enjoy.",Eragon

351,FreakierThanThou,Not as bad as some say,8,22 December 2006,"There were some moments of Eragon that I had problems with. The timing, for one. It went much to fast, a few hours giving months worth of travel, growth, or training for the characters. But overall, I found the movie worthwhile, if you can ignore that.The book was different, and, in a way, I might have had an advantage over some others, not remembering it very clearly. But honestly, have you ever seen a movie based off of a book that was completely true? You have to be able to ignore the changes. There will be people who will hate it if it's not identical to the book. If you're one of those people, I would advise you not to waste your time seeing it, because it's not.Yes, as others have pointed out, it has similarities to other books and movies, but so what? Lots of movies and books follow formulas of previous successes.Eragon is a movie you shouldn't try and compare to predecessors. If you can do that, it will be very good.

I can understand the need to change parts of the story to fit it into the movie. I can understand that money can limit what can and can't be done. *hint*: Urgal horns can't be that expensive. What I can't understand is why they felt it was needed to remove most of the book and change what was left.They removed whole races who are important to the storyline. They removed the Urgals' horns. They removed the pointy Elvish ears. They removed Katrina. There was no were-cat. Arya was totally out of character. In the interest of making sure that we could actually tell the movie was based on the book, they threw in most of the major characters for a grand five seconds each. Sadly they were given crud-tastic dialogue and in my opinion, made into jokes.After I realized the movie wasn't going to be what I'd hoped for, I tried looking at it from the eyes of someone who hadn't read the book. All I saw was a jolting, dismembered story that didn't flow, didn't explain itself. There's Ajihad.. quick everyone.. wave. There he goes.I was actually quite mad when I left the theater. I felt cheated. I would pay $20 for a ticket to go see the real movie. The one that was supposed to be playing. Heck, the story was worth two movie's worth of time.

I mean for a movie made after a 500 page book the movie is very short (130 minutes or so minutes) Next thing that makes this movie bad is the musical score. Most of the time its a happy fanfare which doesn't make much sense because the movie is not all happy. And in a scary moment in the movie in which an elf Arya is getting hurt tortured etc. The music is exciting. The next point is about the realism of the movie. Alright first of all, all of the city's in the Empire (the bad guys in the book and movie) have evil architechure like every building is made of black stone. Now tell me why you would make every city out of black stone in an empire. Sure the empire is evil but there are still people that live there that don't want to but a house made of evil looking black stone. It Looks like a Goth emo Castle instead of Urubaen in the book. My point is that just because people are evil doesn't mean. They live in black devilish citys. Anyway I hope I have made you not want to go see this movie.

Day turning into night and back again (no hint of magic), and change of scenes without warning, the editors and producers of this movie could've done well to have hired a someone to oversee the film for continuity in the editing room, perhaps even going to reshoot some scenes. I see on the Official website for the novel that Eragon is 15, not seventeen as indicated in the movie. Perhaps it was trying too hard to please the older teen crowd (those with their own money) rather than the pre-teen and younger teen crowds (that need to depend on parents to attend movies).

The sets are quite awesome - we should all be thankful that they filmed in Hungary. Jeremy Irons is, as always, awesome, especially in this role. I would have loved to have seen Ian McKellan cast because I think he is incredible, but I think Irons is better for the part. Also, one comment I read said that Ed Speleers is always just solemn - to them, I say that Speleers is not 19, and everyone has a basic expression. Plus, film acting is a lot harder than it seems - just ask the great and powerful 2 time Oscar winner Michael Caine - he would know.

They took an acceptable story, added a great deal of money and obtained a very disappointing result. Irons is of course an impressive actor but in this movie it is a waste. The story is star wars, the visuals Tolkein but everything comes up wanting other than an impressive dragon.

I especially liked the way it was filmed as well as the look and feel of computer generated dragon. From this point of view, the movie is very cool. As for the actor performance, Jeremy Irons kicks ass! Even if his character, Brom, is not so well written, he does a marvelous job.

The script was terrible, directing almost substandard at times, and the dialog more or less horrid most of the time. There are two people with any acting talent in this movie, Irons and Malkovich, who both do very nicely, despite Malkovich's lack of screen time and the dialog forced upon them.

By the way the novel was written, Paolini worked very hard on the novel and put a lot of imagination into it. I thought the actors were OK. It was one of Ed Speelers earlier movies so you can't expect it to be perfect.

The Shadow Beast is something else). Much cooler! If Durza and Eragon were just fighting on foot, like in the book, it would make the scene boring.If the movie copied Eragon word by word, it would be an extremely LONG and BORING movie, so thankfully, Stefan Fangmeier & company cropped it.When Saphira hatches and when she magically grows, that's a great improvement from the book. If it went as the book, it would be, as mentioned, an incredibly long movie.Although, some things were not as good, like: John Malkovich's acting was terrible, not to mention lame. >:( In the scene when Brom dies, Jeremy Irons seemed too full of himself (as in, 'look at me, I am so kingly).Overall, an excellently made movie!

I'm more interested in whether this movie was worth my time, and it definitely was.Another annoying thing about the reviews for this movie are claims that it's derivative. Sure, you will see parts of other movies in this one, but everyone forgets that Star Wars was derived from previous movies as well. There are only rarely completely new ideas in movies, and again, they generally make poor movies.By now, if you're seeing this film, you're seeing it on DVD and probably haven't paid $40 at the theater to see it. Frankly, I would have been willing to pay full price to see this in a theater. The various scenes with Saphira aren't as impressive on a small screen. But for the price of a DVD or rental, this is well worth your money and time. Particularly if you have younger kids, this has all the action they could want without much gore, gratuitous violence, and adult situations. My pre-teen kids, my wife and I thought this was just as good, if not better than the Chronicles of Narnia movie.",Eragon
365,queendarkjewel,Kiddie Version,5,24 March 2007,"Having not read the books because they were of a younger written quality, I approached this movie with an open mind and came away feeling I'd seen the younger version of the film. The dragon Safira was the shining gem of this movie as were the backgrounds she flies against. The mix of feathers and scales seemed like a combo of Asian and European dragons. I thought the girl could have been completely left out and the story would have been none the worse. Maybe in the books she has significance and maybe then so does the king, who was far less than intimidating. My ending thought was isn't it sad how people pay all that money for special effects and forget the script riders. I read that there were a lot of LOTR similarities and there were...a LOT. I gave it a 5 cause I've seen worse and love dragons, and thank God for Rachel Weiz cause she saved this film from being a complete piece of crap.",Eragon
366,randomgenericcodename,The worst movie since Alexander,1,2 January 2008,"The difference between the book and the movie is like the difference between The Lord of the Rings and Alexander. In case you didn't get the clue, I have read the book. The Ra'zac are very important in the first two books and they die in this movie, they don't show Galbatorix in either of the books, the Urgals were supposed to look like tall Orcs with horns, they completely cut out over five cities and towns and they cut out the dwarfs. They shouldn't have let a new director start off a career with a book to movie adaptation. You would think that someone who has worked on Terminator 2, Jurassic Park and The Bourne Identity would actually be good at making movies. In my opinion they should have at least tried to get Peter Jackson who is actually good at finding new talent and making movies. My opinion on watching this movie is don't, just don't.",Eragon
367,superstoneste,"""I expected more!""",2,28 September 2008,"Such a let down. Nothing like the book. I had high hopes to see this movie ever since I read the book and they slaughtered it. Bad story, cheesy acting and some lame makeup, especially with Galbatorix. What was the deal with showing him with those stupid looking finger nails at the end. Why did Durza change? I liked how he looked at the beginning half of the movie, but before the battle at the end, all the makeup changed and he looked very different. When my mom saw the movie, she asked if it was a different Shade. Why were the dwarfs tall? Where were Arya's pointy ears? This was a very low budget film. Why? Make it a big budget!! It was an excellent book, it deserves an excellent movie.",Eragon
368,anifreak93,"Oh, the agony.",1,9 May 2008,"Eragon the book- a remarkable story about a boy and his dragon (in the simplest terms I can use.) Eragon the movie- Uh...wait, what? The previews and trailers made it look amazing. I was looking forward to seeing it. Two days after it came out, I dragged my grandmother to it. We sat down and watched it. A few minutes in and I was a bit skeptical. Halfway through, I wanted to puke. At the end, I nearly did as I stumbled out of the theater. My grandmother said it wasn't too bad. Of course, it's not if you don't read the book. If you have...Oh...oh dear...I feel a dizzy spell coming on just thinking about it. Characters are changed drastically, placed in the wrong setting at the wrong time, saying all the wrong things for the wrong reasons. Motives are changed for no reason, and important parts of the story are eliminated all together. I always complain that ""Saphira grew up too fast"" to get the rebuttal ""It's a montage!"" It's the most poorly performed montage I've witnessed. People say they enjoy Saphira's voice. I don't. Saphira doesn't name herself- Eragon names her after Brom gives him the idea for it. She's not supposed to sound like a girl! Yes, you read that right. Why else would it take Eragon so long to figure out why she doesn't like the male names he lists! Do yourselves a favor- readers of the Eragon books, do NOT read it. I've told my mom and her boyfriend this, as they're reading it as well. I've told them repeatedly and loudly ""Do NOT go see the movie!!""",Eragon
369,Demonia,Book Fans let down but a fair fantasy,4,8 October 2008,"I have read the book. I expected awesome effects for the magic parts in it, a terrific dragon, excellent fight sequences, great character interpretations and stunning locations. Of that I got a terrific dragon and maybe SOME great character interpretations. Brom done by Jeremy Irons (sorry if I mispelt that) was brilliant and played it off really well and I didn't think that Eragon (can't think who played him) wasn't too bad.HOWEVER That is no excuse for silly mistakes, huge excerpts removed, characters missing and important key points left out. For example may I ask what the point of changing Arya's hair colour from black to blonde was? It may seem a small mistake but for me it signified nothing but the start of many mistakes. Also Angela plays a very important role and is played in a CITY not some stick hut village with 5 minute screen time basically. Selembum didn't even appear and he played a key role in the series.Summary Had the directors actually bothered to give it the work it deserved they could have had a HUGE smash on their hands but instead they give it a 1 1/2 hour bodged job compared to Lord of the ring's 3 hourish film and cut out all the important parts so they can't cash in on the other books in the series. Being optimistic people who haven't read the book might enjoy it.",Eragon
370,Queen_oogabooga,What Were They Thinking,2,20 June 2008,"About three years ago a friend of mine pushed the Eragon book at me, telling me that I just had to read it. And, after reading it I was completely in love with it. So as you can imagine I was very excited when the movie came out. I saw it the very first day, thinking that it would be just the best movie. I was very angry as I left the theater. They cut out over half the story, and the story they did leave in really didn't make any sense at all. The acting was poor, the special effect left much to be desired, and I was utterly confused. The Urgals looked like big scary guys with too many tattoos, Murtagh appeared out of nowhere in the middle of the story, Solembum was nowhere to be seen, and the twins never bothered to show up. If that wasn't enough they sent Roran off to avoid being drafted for the war, and Saphira did a years worth of growing after fifteen seconds in a lightning storm. What was going on? I have no idea. Even Rachel Wiesz's wonderful performance as the voice of Saphira couldn't save this one. So once again, what were they thinking? One of the best fantasy novels written in recent years, has been absolutely slaughtered in this very badly made adaptation.",Eragon
371,biologydash,A Let Down,3,28 July 2013,"I was very disappointed with this film having read the book prior to watching it. Major story plots were changed while making the film, none of which made the story any more palatable on screen. The cast was well selected and each member did an excellent job portraying their characters. Visual effects were good but went overboard in changing the story plot. The storyline majorly deviated from the book making it impossible for this movie to be the start of an Inheritance Cycle movie franchise. This was a big shot in the foot for any future movie profit from a well written series. As a stand alone film from the book it was OK at best but certainly not stunning.",Eragon
372,brandonel,god awful,1,24 August 2008,"No just...No this movie is so bad i wish i had my time back NEVER watch this ever even more so if you have read the book now i will elaborate as to why.AHEM!First off the ending was awful they completely changed it to appeal to audiences and make it look like Eragon was the ""hero"" that we all wanted no in the movie he catapults off of saphiras tail and stabs Durza the shade in the book he stabs him when he wasn't looking yea thats right in fact almost the point of the book like o for instance he gets a scar on his back that severely cripples him in the book not in the movie.OK enough of me talking about it compared to the book Arya the elf THE ELF mind you does not have pointed ears none and she should i mean they can make a dragon that flies through the skies but they cant go to a 99 cent store and buy some fake ears.i have no idea where they got the town that floated on water from nor did saphira grow up in like 2 minutes of flying through the air no do not watch this read the book instead and see what it eragon should be",Eragon
373,kongwong,A disservice to the Fantasy Genre,1,16 December 2006,"This movie has some nice CGI special effect and thats about the only good thing I can say about movie.It has a poorly written script and even worse direction. The plot holes are laughable. The characters never fully developed. The story was as predictable as it can be. The experienced actors were wasted with bad lines and limited expositions. The central character need a real actor behind it. Eragon tried to be a Lord of the Ring clone, except the producers and the directors forgot how many hours Peter Jackson and his team put in on working the script. This isn't a movie that deserve its Chritmas slot. I hope the sequel never gets made.Save your money and get a burger or something. This movie is not worth the film it is shot on.",Eragon
374,Ariellina,"Um, okay but have you read the book reviews?",7,17 August 2010,"I skipped both the book and the movie because of the reviews. I heard it was copied from other fantasy works, and that it wasn't a good copy. Here's my issue then. Why would I skip the movie and read the book? I still haven't read the book because it is too long for my liking, especially when I hear how many people remark that it is an amateur effort. Overall, I actually enjoyed the movie when I eventually saw it. It's really not that bad. I can see where people think the acting is lame or something like that, but overall it really isn't that bad. From what I hear the BOOK is bad. The other thing I don't get is how can you say the book and movie are nothing alike? I have had multiple people tell me the basic story of the book and I think it matched the movie really well. Anyway, I say skip the book and watch the movie, because I have heard worse things about the book, and I would rather watch amateur acting than read amateur writing.",Eragon
375,sanctuz_747,This movie is awful! For the people who like it. Read it!,1,24 March 2009,"Certainly the worst and the most disappointing movie ever. I almost cancel my holiday to Bali (Beach) for this! There are a lot characters do not show up, the setting is (no word bad enough to describe it). (I'm speechless, its even worse than the guy version of Naruto even if there is). The Varden is actually black people? By the way, I do not want to offend African-American people, but I thought Varden is white people. Moreover, the ending really unimaginably not like what it supposed to be. The scene, where Eragon and Murtagh wanted to retrieve Arya was ... bad. The castle was not big enough. The war is like child war where there are only 100 people or so involved. Lastly, there is no follow up of Eragon's brother. Can you imagine that!?",Eragon
376,katie_ryn7,Why didn't you just light the book on fire? It would have given it more justice.,1,2 April 2010,"The movie was absolutely horrible. I have read all of the books that have been released so far in The Inheritance Cycle. So many things were wrong with this movie. It would have been a better use of time to just skip making the movie and chalk it up as a failure. I suppose the movie wouldn't be as terrible if you haven't read any of the books. Arya was supposed to be Asian for crying out loud. So many things happened out off sequence or were just skipped all together. Some of the best parts were left out. This movie was butchered so badly, that there is no hope to even attempt to make a sequel, not that there should be one made. It was a big disappointment.",Eragon
377,peedge-740-91141,Abysmal,1,31 May 2010,"This is one of the worst movies i have ever seen. I was and still am a fan of the book, it was one of my favourite books around the time i went to see the movie so i had high hopes for the movie to show how good the book was. Those high hopes soon came crashing down. The storyline was horrendously bad, it was if someone had given the writers the briefest summaries of the novel and they decided to turn it into a film based on what they had heard, they just eradicated everything that made the novel good and they also have destroyed any chance for a sequel. That brings me to the writing itself, it was equally bad if not worse than the storyline. The lines in the movie were mostly cheesy, empty or both, scenes that were meant to be tense just lost all their tension when the lines were delivered. Also, whose smart idea was it to not have short dwarfs, they were basically the same height as the humans around them!! The acting was poor and that's putting it lightly. the majority of the lines were delivered without any emotion, nothing the actors did made me feel any kind of emotion. John Malkovich as the evil king didn't do it for me, it wasn't sinister, it seemed more like a slightly annoyed English noblemen. Robert Carlyle as the Shade was slightly more sinister and gave one of the best performances(which wasn't hard to do). The dragon Saphira's voice done by Rachel Weisz was probably the best performance which tells you how good the other actors were. If you have read the novel Eragon Don't see the movie and if you haven't read the novel, still ,DONT watch it, it isn't worth your time.",Eragon

Yes I agree they left some details out like Roran didn't really go off to avoid being taken to fight Galbatorix's army and Eragon is actually 15... and... well... other stuff but overall it was a great on-the-edge-of-your-seat action packed movie! Ed Speelers did a great job in his acting, as did Rachel Weisz of course. The book was fantastic - I definitely suggest you read it rather than watch the movie, but the producers and director did a great job in working with what they had. Next time though - please make a 600 page book into a 2 hour movie! I want the next one! (Eldest)!",Eragon
379,pink-crazy-chick,The film is good if you haven't read the books.,5,1 May 2011,Now where to start.I saw this film before I read the book and thought it was brilliant. If you haven't read the book then I would definitely recommend watching the film because it is very enjoyable. Unfortunately however if you have read the books you will be severely disappointed by how much the movie portrays the book which admittedly isn't very much at all. In fact the names of the characters is pretty much all thats the same.There couldn't possibly be a second movie produced as they do not include Eragon blessing the child which later in the books becomes quite a big character.Also they have changed vital story lines to fit the movie.The acting is not particularly brilliant but if your a child/teenager thats not something you will really notice. Overall I would say if your not a fan of books then watch the movie but I would definitely recommend the books over the film as they all are absolutely brilliant and I personally read them several times.,Eragon
380,frecklefluff,How disappointing,3,1 January 2007,"An already-written, very good coming of age story with an epic journey, epic battles, amazing characters, and a dragon. A DRAGON. How could something that potentially incredible be turned into a steaming hot mess? I don't know, but they managed to do it.Having read (and loved) the book, I knew much of the detail would have to be condensed. However, ""condensed"" doesn't have to mean ""hacked into a bloody, incoherent mess,"" as was done here. There is no sense of time passage, no smooth storyline, no character development (hint to filmmakers everywhere: when major characters loved by the hero get hurt or die, the viewer should feel SOMETHING). Unlike a previous reviewer, I found the cinematography quite lacking; the vistas are bleak and uninspiring, and one shot in particular, a sort of made-for-TV-movie zoom in to Brom's face, is very distracting. The effects were all right, nothing to write home about. The screenplay veered away from the excellent source material and was completely uninspired, full of pointless one-liners and focusing on the Hollywood bad-movie tradition of the supervillain menacing his main henchman, who in turn menaces his sub-henchmen, who in turn ... I dunno, go home and kick their dogsthe movie version of incompetent middle management.But worst of all (and encompassing all of the above) was the direction. When Jeremy Irons comes off as cheesy and melodramatic, and Djimon Hounsou is wooden and unaffecting, the director obviously hasn't a clue what he is doing. (I am giving John Malkovich's scenery-chewing King Galbatorix a pass becausewell, because it is always fun to watch John Malkovich chew scenery.)  Hmm. I popped back to the main page to see who directed it. Now I see the problem. Stefen Fangmeier. The director of  nothing. This was his directorial debut. Whose bright idea was it to take a huge epic story and place it in the inexperienced hands of someone who has never before directed a movie? AndI almost can't believe I'm seeing thishave him work from a screenplay written by someone whose only other credit is Jurassic Park III? Who was the editor, I wonder? Curious George? This could have been so much better. Poor, poor Christopher Paolini.",Eragon
381,Fynarra,Yet another good book ruined,4,17 December 2006,"Like ""The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe"", yet another good book ruined. Special effects: very nice; Resemblance to plot of book: Scary Movie would be closer.With disappointing jumblings and cuttings of the plot; with important things trivialized and whole important characters left out it had me frowning the whole time. The elves are humans, the dwarfs are humans, the Shade is a wimp, and Murtaugh isn't anything like he should be. Plot points were ruined for snide-commentary reasons (like the King's men supposedly being in the village, and Eragon's cousin not going away like he was supposed to, nor involving the butcher's daughter, etc.)If you like seeing pretty CG--go for it. If you liked the book, stay away.",Eragon
382,alexjonlin,Not with the book at all,2,14 January 2007,"Eragon was pretty much terrible. I loved the book, but I'd say 75% of the book was cut out for the movie. I expected them to cut it out, but cutting out that much? And of the scenes that they did include, almost all of them were nothing like the book. They spent way to much of the movie in Carvahall, then raced through the rest of the story, all leading up to the climax, which literally lasted about 30 seconds. The scenery was also bad, with a lot of the key elements described in the book not there. I really wish someone had done a better job, because it gives a bad name to Eragon, which was a great book. All in all, if you have not seen this movie yet, you should not see it, as it is nothing like the book.",Eragon
383,gtx5_crusader,"Overall, worth watching again, if you're not a stickler for perfection",8,13 April 2007,"For the loyal fan of the book series, this movie is lacking in detail, depth, and character development. Some characters from the book aren't even in the movie, and specific details on landscape, character detail, and the like, are a bit off from the book as well.However, in overlooking some of those flaws, one has to really look at the movie as just that; a movie for entertainment. It moved a little fast (thus the lacking in the development part), but still covered enough to keep you going with the story and enjoying the action scenes (what little there was of them). Rather than seeming like a movie that told the entire story in one go, it seems as though it was an opening for more to come.Ed Speelers, for his first major role, I think did excellent in his role, bringing out the strong-willed but at most times foolish Eragon, but, again, that's the most we get out of the character.Bypass the lack of detail, somewhat quick movement of storyline, and relatively short action scenes, I think it makes out for a very awesome movie that even with these issues, it's worth another watch... or two... or three...",Eragon

However, this review is solely based on the content of the movie.Eragon began in a rather confusing manner, with the first 15 minutes being extremely choppy (moving from one scene to another without much flow), and took a very long time to get off the ground (no pun intended).After the action picked up, however, it became very confusing. If anyone in our theater that night had not read the book and been familiar with the characters and places, they would have left very confused.The acting was fine, Jeremy Irons did an extremely impressive job as Brom, and Edward Speleers is showing promise. I was disappointed, however, to see that many key characters that were cast for roles hyped up as ""big and impressive"" were only in the movie for a few minutes.All in all, it wasn't a horrible movie, however, it could have been done a lot better...",Eragon
385,gartencat,Just does not cut it.,1,29 April 2007,"Disgraceful adaptation of the bestselling young adult novel fails because of the lack of character development and a script that rushed through the whole story, making the movie fall way short of the very worthy book. This movie should have been a two or three-hour ordeal. Instead, we feel cheated with a movie that has cut out so much you feel like whoever wrote the script picked random parts of the movie to include. I don't mind cutting down the story but when you leave out main characters and even change entire parts of the story then you end up with a very choppy movie that just doesn't satisfy. It was something the film people threw together with a lot of special effects for the holidays. of course, if you haven't read the book, then you won't know what this movie cut out and you won't miss it. Out of all the performances, only Rachel Weisz's voice performance as the dragon and Jeremy Irons small but pivotal role do their characters and the film any justice but not even their great talent could forgive such an embarrassing cinematic translation of the original novel.",Eragon
386,celticravenwolf,Will they turn ANYTHING into a movie?,4,30 January 2008,"With all of the amazing fantasy novels out there, how did 'Eragon' manage to become a Hollywood blockbuster? From start to finish it is clear that the author of this creation has read the 'Lord of the Rings' and 'Dragonriders of Pern' series one too many times. The borrowing from both worlds is painfully obvious, and what isn't is still generic and stale.The film is predictable and laughable - especially the part where a farmboy is supposed to lead an already organized resistance based on the sole fact that he's the only remaining dragonrider, never mind the fact that he's never seen battle! The film's only saving grace is that the dragon - once you get over the baboon-like face and half-feathered/half-bat wings - is beautifully animated. The cinematography is far more breathtaking and costly than this script deserved.My advice? If you love dragons, rent this film solely for the amazingly lifelike movements of the dragon, but feel free to fast forward the rest of it. Everyone else? Don't waste your time or money.",Eragon

I think the actors do really well, the landscape shots are just beautiful, and the story is very absorbing. I really was part of this dragon world for the time it lasted. The limitation of this positive comment may be indeed that i have not read the book and thus cannot tell whether the movie is faithful to the book or if important parts of the story line are missing. I also agree that the movie seemed a bit rushed and it may be a little short for the story it tries to tell. I don't agree that this is a movie merely for kids.

388,dogsoldier_spoon-1,"a total waste of time, money and talent",1,27 December 2006,"well, not so long ago, I guess it was like in November or anything. I found this trailer on youtube and I wondered ""Eragon"" hmm what is this. Saw the trailer and I was impressed, I read it was based on a novel so I got it somewhere in December (well lend it actually). Today, just an hour before I went to the cinema I finished it and I couldn't wait. I went to the theater, I sat myself on (right on time) and I was disappointed for the rest of the day. Still am by the way. So, what's wrong? you'll ask me. God, where do I begin. First of all, I'm the kinda person who wants movies based on books, games or whatever be good and alike. I mean, if you're doing something then you could at least do it right. I have been disappointed many times by a bad movie version of a very good book or game. Well, I got to say I'm still wondering what the book and the movie had uncommon. Very few things I might say. The story was changed in many ways - sure they didn't have 5 hours time, I know but still - but not in a good way. The Raz'ac looked like wimps, the urgals were nothing like I imagined and there were no dwarfs or magic cat or even the twins. No dwarfs, it just made me angry cause I was looking forward to those scenes. Then you have all those top actors like Malkovich, Hounsou, Guillory (well not exactly top but she's pretty good) marching by for like 5 minutes. I hoped this would be Hedlund's big breakthrough but he was hardly in the film. while all these good actors have a small role in the film, the main lead is by no other then Eddie Speleers. A horrible actor who seems to have no charisma at all. He made Hayden Christensen look like he should win an Oscar for his performance. Totally horrific. And then there was Rachel Weisz, not a bad actress but her voice was totally unfitting. Didn't know what Joss Stone was doing in the movie actually... And they changed the two main characters too much. Saphira was irritating and she didn't seem to thrust anyone, not to mention that Eragon was very arrogant and totally not like he should be. The story was also rushed and really rushed I mean. The best quotes and most beautiful scenes where left out. While in the book Brom's death touched me, it only made me laugh in the theater...But the movie has it's good points. The special effects where nice and Robert Carlyle's performance was awesome. In my eyes he's the only good thing in this movie. Sure Durza didn't show up much in the book and yeah his smoke monster fight was also not that great, his acting was just awesome. To put it in a few words. If you haven't read the book and you want to relax, go and see it. But if you're a fan, just skip it cause you'll be disappointed and angry. My only hope is that I will still be alive if they will remake it. Hell, I'll do it myself if I have to. So anyway, this movie was a total waste of time, money and talent. I guess they just spend too much at the cast and way too few on the script writer. But there's hope for the future...greetings, Spooney",Eragon

390,david_wennberg,The worst type of films are the ones that are nothing special...,4,19 December 2006,"Well, they certainly can't all be Lord of the Rings now can they? Peter Jackson singlehandedly resurrected a genre that had never truly been given its just rewards. Fantasy had always been a b-genre that no one was interested in making because to be brutally honest most of the entries were terrible. Then Harry Potter exploded onto the world and proved that it indeed had a widespread audience. Chris Columbus was not the right man for the job of directing the first two installments of Harry Potter, his vision just was lacking and his commercial aspirations too blind to give the series what it so desperately needed an artist! That's why Prisoner of Azkaban was so brilliant, the director is an artist! But no one was prepared for the artistic genus and awe-inspiring brilliance of Peter Jackson's Lord of the Rings! The world embraced the Rings series for good reason. There had simply been nothing like them and they were magnificently done in every way! Well, not to be outdone by other studios, Disney was quick to procure another beloved fantasy classic, Narnia and get it out there as fast as possible. The Lion, The Witch and the Wardrobe proved that even in spite of its budget, hype and nearly sightless martyrdom (not to mention the outrageous hypocrisy of its Christian fan basis, but that's another story), Narnia lacked heart and that can not be balanced by a big budget or a director experienced only in virtual craftsmanship and writers who simply couldn't handle the job.Likewise, Eragon lacks the heart and craftsmanship of Lord of the Rings but much more is missing.The archetypes are all in place the unassuming, pure and innocent peasant turned hero who is locked in a tyrannical world lorded over by the fathomlessly evil king and his malevolent little minions, the beautiful maiden and of course wonderful and fantastical mythical creatures. Yes, it is true that it's all been done before, but what elevates such novel standards is the heart and soul of the story! The creation is incredibly important and certainly the players must be deeply committed to the telling of the tale. What should have been an epic journey of self-discovery became nothing more then a shadow of what it could have been, a shadow of what the book was! Where Lord of the Rings is and I frankly think will always be that which by all other fantasy films will be judged, Eragon is a throwback to the type of film that killed the genre to begin with. Oh the special effects are glorious to behold, and certainly we have a handsome hero to root for but with bad writing and poor directing the vision just wasn't there! It takes a truly visionary director to bring worlds to life that existed long ago, the future or only in myth when a mediocre man is given the job most suited for an artist the result is Eragon. First-time director Stefen Fangmeier was either completely out of his depths or immensely intimidated by the weight of the project and without any doubt the industrial arrogance and artistically devoid producers and indeed the studio. The truth of the matter is that most of the time movies are not made for artistic purposes family fare, action flicks and comedies are prime examples of films that require no artistic vision at all. But studios and producers wrongly believe that all movies can be successful without artistic vision, and that is simply not true! Fantasy is an artistic genre and without a true artist at the helm, we get a cheap Nickelodeon version of Lord of the Rings. When the job of truly brilliant writers who can condense successfully a massive tome down to a coherent, honest and faithful adaptation with heart and substance is given to a visionless neophyte as well the result is beyond disappointing. Eragon could have been a great addition to the genre, but as is it is nothing special and quite frankly, like Narnia, nothing worth remembering.",Eragon
391,twisted_little_star84,Just lean back and enjoy this powerful ride!,10,23 December 2006,"I went to see this movie with really bad expectations after hearing on these boards how terrible this movie is. But I actually found it amazing.I think the story is a little too cliché, but it works for the most part. If Harry Potter, Narnia and Lord Of The Rings can pull these kind of clichés off, then Eragon can too.The actors were good enough with what they got. Jeremy Irons did an amazing job as Brom. John Malkovich was good but had too few scenes. He should at least have had a dozen more. Ed Speelers was really good as Eragon. But the scene stealer was the CGI dragon Saphira. It was just amazing to see this dragon live and breathe. The rest of the FX were really good too, but Saphira is what makes this movie soar.The negative things are the movie is too short and it feels a little gutted. Also it wouldn't hurt that actors like John Malkovich and Djimon Hounsou are given a little more to do. But all in all this is a very good movie.I don't understand all the negativity it is getting because that is undeserved. Looking forward too the next one (hopefully it will be made).",Eragon

That's where the excellent costuming and graphics take over. But even those are so rushed you aren't given time to appreciate an Urgal or a Razac, etc. The Razacs, a big part of the book, were shown so briefly I can't even assess how they really looked, though it seems they didn't look a thing like described in the book.Several key characters are missing. The oppression of living under Galbatorix's reign is barely even hinted at. The narrated intro and Malkovich's menacing sneer in a couple of cameos is supposed to replace a real base plot. All characters are quickly glossed over and lacking any substantial screen time to make you love or hate them appropriately. Murtagh showed up briefly as a grinning metrosexual, completely annihilating any parallels with the book; which is the case with most plots and characters included. Completely unnecessary and fractionating changes abound. What *is* there was nicely done, visually; and it really was a shame that the story wasn't given its due respect in the movie. It could have been really one memorable movie and people would be anxiously awaiting the next. As it is, I can only yawn when contemplating a sequel. Paolini must not have had any significant clout in this, like a more seasoned writer might have. Oh...I gave it a 5 because my 7 year old loved it. (and I love Robert Carlyle).

394,nix_wesclark04,Fooled over the nice trailer.,4,16 December 2006,"I just got back from the cinema and i can't believe how disappointed i was for watching this movie on a night where i wanted a good fun, and usually after a good movie i'll feel pleased to have watched it, but all i got carried along with me from the cinema to home was only disappointment and no fun at all.The trailer look quite fabulous i must say. That's what made me wanted to see the movie in the first place.Eragon was...well, i am a fan of adventure/epic/fictional movies. Been a greater fan of it ever since Lord of the Rings trilogy made it to the big screen and got a major homerun.Eragon was disappointing because of, ONE: the introduction to the character, the new 'world' and so on was quite badly done for it was quite short-cut-ed and the arrangement of the plot was lame and very predictable and not to mention how uninteresting it was. TWO: I'm not going to blame the author, he has his right over his own imagination. However, similarities i mean A LOT of similarities with LOTR was hardly deniable! I hit me right in the face somehow! Examples? Elvish tongues were used to cast spells. Eragon has his somewhat 'Aragorn'; Morzan's son..it was like Frodo-Aragorn thing. Then there's Agaesian version of 'Helm's Deep'- i cant remember the place's name, but it's obvious with the stone building on the mountains, war happened there, the sound of the blowing horn. And those Ra'zac are SO Eragon's version of the dark riders in LOTR! Same goes with those Urgals, in Eragon they are the Orcs! THREE: There's nothing really original in that story. Everything were quite clichéd. There wasn't even that 'it' to grab a hold of you when you watch such movies. FOUR: It's too predictable. FIVE: Cinematography was not that bad, but not that good either. I was hoping for the 'flying' feeling when going to see this movie. But that didn't happen. The scores wasn't original or distinctive enough but they were just O.K. SIX: No, i don't read the book. BUT, everything in that movie was simply merely a sweet dream of a young boy, being in his stereotypical fantasy land where to most people they already know the idea and it's pretty lame. Pretty girl running the forest...ooo the mystery-beauty. I'm 17 too, so c'mon! SEVEN: The dialogue, my god, was predictable and i had to say that the script was VERY lame and it's like the typical drama script where you can totally know what the lead character would say to a dying man and vice-versa.This will be a trilogy. Since i've seen the first part, i of course would just simply want to watch the next one because i've watched the first one! Still yet i'm not too convinced that Eragon's gonna be the next big thing in the cinema. Plus, after the movie ended, everyone just got out from the cinema not even talking about the movie at all!So, if you have to watch something on the cinema for the sake of fun, just be alert that you've been warned not to make your day even less fun by watching Eragon. Just wait till it comes out on DVD or something.",Eragon

I think the only thing they got right were the names! I'm dreadfully sorry Christopher Paolini... They got it wrong from character description to plot line! At first I was giving them a little credit cause they needed to edit it to make a movie, but by the time the sent Roran off to avoid the war instead of to work in a mill, I was fed up! I do give credit to the actors, they did very well for what they were given.

396,tjw387,I Had High Hopes But Was Disappointed,4,27 December 2006,"Okay let's begin; Eragon doesn't deserve to be called anything better then mediocre. I had high expectations for this film considering the last five years of December fantasy films have either been good or great but Eragon has broken that streak. It is pretty bad, the acting while not horrible the script is. A 12 year old could have probably made a better script then what we got. If it weren't for Jeremy Irons the movie would probably be unwatchable, he is given almost nothing but does the best he can with what he was given. Sadly the main character Eragon played by Ed Speleers doesn't fair as well, his performance is sorely lacking any punch but he does try his best.Now for the positive's if your still reading this review, the special effects while not quite as good as the Lord of the Rings films are still a blast to watch. Saphira the dragon is beautiful and amazing when in flight. There just simply aren't enough dragons on film. Saphira is great but the other effects are all about average with nothing special about them, not bad just not spectacular. This movie is all about the dragon which is great but it just isn't enough to save this film.What this film proves is that good effects with no story won't make a movie. You need to start with a great story and luckily Eragon has one the problem is they took the story and butchered everything until you were left with a film with almost no character development and no interest. Another problem is the running time of this film, it barely runs over an hour and a half this is a problem because it leaves us with rushed material and it shows. all of the story is told through monologue's which can be good but when it makes up most of a film it becomes tedious and boring, much like what occurred with The Da Vinci Code earlier this year. Eragon is best left for a bargain bin at Wal Mart. If you need to have your December fantasy film fix I would highly recommend catching Guillermo Del Toro's Pan's Labyrinth instead. The film is for a more mature crowd then Eragon but but unlike Eragon it's actually worth the price of an admission ticket.",Eragon
397,Grimreaper62292,"Adaptation: Terrible, rushed, but still entertaining",4,16 December 2006,"Eragon was a entertaining movie, but for those of us who have read the book, beware, this film mixes and matches parts and even takes out entire scenes that take up to fifty pages in the book! This movie was highly rushed and changed how certain things happened so if you hadn't read the book, you could understand what the heck was going on. Though scenes like Teirm and the Hadarc Desert were taken out, they took the information from there and put it other scenes. Scenes were also highly changed, but surprisingly, only about one thing was added in the movie if it wasn't changed. Many characters were dismissed such as Katrina, Salebum (Werecat), Jeod, and the Twins were removed from the movie, they made an excuse by making this movie an hour and forty minutes. It was very rushed and if they added a half an hour to the movie, it could have been much better. I do have comment positively, and that is were the visual effects and acting comes in. The effects were phenomenal! It WAS real. or at least the effects made it look that way. The acting was also amazing. Jeremy Irons and John Malkovich create a strong cast, not to mention the new actors, Ed Speelers, Chris Egan, and Garett Hedlund. Djimon Hounsou created a great Ajihad. If you haven't read the book, this creates a very entertaining movie, but it is a different story than the book, only with the same plot.",Eragon
398,proximo_sinister,This movie had such potential...its a shame it was treated in this haphazard way,1,28 December 2006,"When will movie studios begin to respect the public? Just because fantasy genre films are popular does not mean that we, the fans will turn any film into a blockbuster just because it has a dragon in it. The movie has to be good. I read Eragon, and I enjoyed it. I was able to overlook the Tolkien/Star Wars similarities due to the fact that the author was so young when he wrote it. The story was not bad, though it was certainly not original - I have read worse. Anyway, upon seeing the previews, and what appeared to be fairly laudable CGI, I went to this movie in great anticipation, considering that this year has been devoid of Lord of the Rings, Narnia, and even Harry Potter, in the hopes that I would have a couple of hours to escape from this world. I was wrong. Even having read the book, I was often left puzzled and disgusted with this films ""lack"" of a cohesive story line. Some of the characters were completely unrecognizable from the book - only their names were the same. The scenes do not flow smoothly. In fact, the scenes skip about so badly that you wonder what the film editor was smoking while he/she worked on this cinematic travesty. Jeremy Irons was the only shining moment in this film, but even he could not save this movie. It seems to have been so slipshod. The acting was wooden, and even poor in some cases. The editors did not even attempt to make the story enjoyable or even cognitive. Again, do studios think that fantasy fans will pay to watch anything over and over so long as it has a dragon, or some other mythical creature in it? The answer is NO, and the box office numbers and reviews speak for themselves. The movie did tolerably well on its opening weekend, but by the second, it dropped out of site. Only those who have not scene it are buying tickets now. The movie does not warrant a second viewing, rather they should be refunding ticket sales to viewers who saw it the first time. Again, it is terribly sad to see a fairly enjoyable story meet such a dreadful cinematic demise. Where have you gone, Peter Jackson?????",Eragon

Soon you realize it's a rip off of ""Lord of the Rings"" and ""Star Wars"" at the same time, with a hint of ""Dungeon and Dragons the Movie"" (Which Jeremy Irons also starred in. However his acting was little better in Eragon, but not by much). The only cool part in the movie was where the dragon was fighting the smoke demon. Then came the cliffhanger at the end. I was thinking ""Oh no an other Eragon movie coming!?"" I have a high tolerance for bad movies, but this one was testing me.

I watch it every time its on! I was reading a lot of the reviews and people are not happy with it. I assume it is because it is based off a book and I never read the book, but people who read the books that become movies need to realize that things are always changed and compacted to get the main point of the story across in a 2 hour time span.The dialog is equivalent to that of the Star Wars movies which is considerably corny at times, but these movies are always written in such a way it should not be a surprise to audiences. The special effects in the movie were all well done. I also felt that the acting in this film was believable. I felt that all actors did well, and there was a pretty large and well-known cast.Overall, this cast did a good job and the movie flowed even though there were a few things here and there that could be considered plot holes. For instance, Eragon pretty much goes from a farm boy to a Dragon/Slade slayer in a day and receives practically no practice or teachings. How did he learn all that so fast?

403,GoddessArtemis85,Fire the casting director and the screenwriter.,4,4 February 2007,"Eragon was a very enjoyable movie. I laughed the whole time, in a very Mystery Science Theater 3000 way. I made a specific point of *not* reading the book before seeing the movie knowing I'd only get angry, and I was very satisfied with that decision. I felt the only strong performances came from Jeremy Irons and Rachel Weisz (the dragon's voice). The young gentleman playing Eragon was ridiculous and pitiable--not at all heroic. His line-delivery showed much to be desired. And my absolute favorite casting job in this charming little film was John Malcovich as the evil king. I mean... come on. Who casts *John Malcovich* as a warmongering king. Have you heard his voice? It is not menacing in that way. If want to cast him as an evil politician or sneaky villain, that's perfect. But his thin almost whiny voice is not believable for a straightforwardly evil villain. (By the way, I'm actually a big John Malcovich fan. If you want to see him well cast, go see Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy or a classic like Of Mice and Men or Death of a Salesman.) As to the screen writing, even having not read the book, I could tell the screenplay clearly did it's predecessor little justice. Too many lines were comical that were clearly not intended to be so. If you want a good laugh, watch this with someone who's good at making fun of movies. It was almost enchantingly corny.",Eragon
404,rasinrice,You could here my chocked laughs throughout the theatre,6,16 December 2006,"Please somebody out there (preferably a talented director), in 15 years or so, remake this movie. I beg of you!I read the book, loved it, and when I heard they were making a movie I could barely contain my excitement. Of course, I heard about the many critics comments, but I thought, 'even so, I am sure I will find it enjoyable.' Eragon is a story that could basically be summed up like this: Star Wars with dragons. Yeah, it's predictable, but hey. Characters: Eragon: He had his moments and I think with better direction he could have really soared. There were some scenes, where I thought maybe a bit too much eyeball narrowing, but hey, that's just me. Saphira: Little dragon Saphira is adorable, but who would have thought her growth spurt was going to be so quick? Eragon literary tossed her in the air and she morphed from toddler, to teen, to young adult in 1 minute flat. And here I ask, why in the heck did they do that!? A big part of Eragon and Saphira's relationship is him taking care of her from birth--the movie completely eliminated those important moments between the two. The rest of their ""building relationship"" was sitting around in the forest with Brom, and Saphira adding in her cheesy lines every once in awhile for what some people consider ""comedy"", I, on the other hand, was to busy laughing at Eragon's leather pants, but that is another story. Sloan: He's the butcher, you know the guy who refused to take Eragon's giant jelly bean, uh, I mean, stone. Anyways three words: They butchered him. yeah, okay, moving on.Roran: In the movie, he had fun wrestling with Eragon and trying to hit him with pots and pans. But then he leaves to go to war, which is completely inaccurate, and I am still failing to see the purpose of it. Garrow: The good old uncle to Eragon. He says a few wordsthan dies. Now get this, Eragon is supposed to find him under the rubble of the home, instead, Garrow lies under a few strategically placed sticks across his body in the living room. Brom walks in and sets him on fire. ""A burial fit for a king,"" he says impatiently, as pulls Eragon out of his grief. I think my mouth hit the floor. Brom: Brom is supposed to be the Gandalf/Dumbledore sort of character. He ends up being a poor chap, who is too wrapped in his own self woe for most of the movie, that he comes off rude and crotchety. Yeah, it's disappointing.Araya: This is the elf chick. She's unconscious for pretty much the entire first book, and she's arrogant, cold, and full of herself, like most elves are. So of course, it would only make sense to have her walking around in her little outfits getting all touchy with Eragon after they have spoken like3 sentences to each other.King Galbatorix: If you don't know already, this is supposed to be the big bad guy. We know this because he likes to glare off in the distance with his eyes narrowed, his arms crossed, and hot flames licking about him. Oh yeah. Unfortunately, the bald head reminds me too much of my uncle; suddenly he seems much less intimidating. Durza: The creepy magician dude, whose make-up changes half-way through the movie. Better than GalbatorixMurtagh: The most underdeveloped character in history! He sort of just jumps in going, HEY lets go find the Varden, YIPEE! So what if he really doesn't want to go there, and is supposed to be the kind of dark depressed guy. They COMPLETELY destroyed his character. Plot: The movie consists of riding on horses and going to Varden to make some fried urgals and stab Durza in the heart. No, but really, there are some major plot holes. If anything, my one complaint stands here. Eragon is a farm boy, not a warrior. During his travels with Brom he had to learn scores of ancient language in order to perform magic, and he fought daily with Brom in order to improve his sword fighting skills. Now, let's move on to the movies take on this. We see one fighting session. Then Eragon is able to perform all kinds of magic, even though he only knows three words. Fire, tree, and branch. Yup, you heard correctlybranch, of which he manages to kill a Ra'zac with. Summing it up: Overall, I felt the movie was riding too much on the cheesy side. There were moments, where I had to stuff my head in my sweater in order to contain my laughter. I think I was so disappointed, I could only laugh. The problem, and I say this with sincerity, is that it had so much potential. It was painful to watch such a great novel thrown into unable hands. From costuming to choreography, it was just short of nothing. Scenes moved choppily. Lines were stuck in, not for sense, but to move on. Characters were tossed in, but never properly developed. The soundtrack lacked emotional ties to the movie, and even the sound effects in many respects lost the punch that it needed. More often than not, I found myself questioning the direction of the scenes, the awkwardness of some of the slide transitions, and noting irritably that nothing really seemed to fit or run smoothly. I am sorry to say, that many of you novel readers will be thoroughly let down. It is sad to see such a great book crumble to pieces on the big screen.",Eragon
405,runnerever,"""I'd like to get my hands on whoever wrote this script""",1,16 December 2006,"I loved the book, but I made sure that when I went into the theater that I stayed objective, knowing that movies after books are rarely (not a one can I think of) true to form. SO..... with great anticipation I looked forward to the interpretation of the director/writers. IT WAS CRAP! My first thought was of my son's homework he did the other night when I told him he had to do it all before going to his wrestling match. Everything was chicken scratch (bcuz he had to write so fast), all of his answers were less than 5 words long and had no complete sentences, and there were many problems in which he he left answers blank, answered a question other than the one asked, or just put a bogus answer that did the reader no service upon reading it. That is how I feel about this movie. Still, I am trying to stay objective and not rate it based upon the storyline in the book. I ASSURE YOU, I AM NOT. But this movie sucks. All of the lines were cheesy, choppy and childish. The plot was never explained, there was no sense of climax, the music didn't match the theme/tone, most scenes were either too long or too short, and WORST OF ALL: All of the Eragon lovers (since I saw it on opening night) were yelling ""booo"" at trash talking it on the way out of the theater. It was a VERY SAD OCCASION for someone who entered the theater desperate for a satisfying experience. Don't waste your money. It will be selling soon online for a buck and then if you want, you may get it for your kids who if they have the maturity level of less than 11, they will probably like it.

The dragon's relationship with the rider, rip-off of Anne McCaffrey's dragons of pern. The cinematography Lord of the Rings rip-off. It was a waste of the talent of Malkovich and Honsou.

The movie did NOT try to be Lord of the Rings and Star Wars combined, as some have said.The movie was entertaining, if you overlook these dreadful errors by the director and the overuse of the term ""farm boy"", even quite good.Nevertheless, the background music, the narration, and a few other bad choices did combine to make the movie seem ""hokie"" early on and gave it a sense of pseudo-grandeur that was NOT part of reading the books. It took away from the suspenseful feeling that should have been presented by the film and permeated one while reading the book.Eragon was fairly true to the book details, if not presenting the spirit or fundamental mood of the book.Another major problem that movie has is that it is neither a children's' movie nor an adult's movie.

In my opinion, the movie needed more traits that are unique to this saga. Everything was very generic; fire breathing dragons, a magic sword, magic spells - all been done before! I also wasn't too fond of Eragon and Saphira's way of communicating. Just show them talking for crying out loud! I loved the final fight sequence though. It was worth seeing just for that, alone. The special effects were extremely believable & exciting during this sequence. I never had trouble believing that Saphira was not actually living and breathing among the characters.

I already came into the theater expecting a disaster after reading the comments but still wasn't enough for my mind to take such a horrible film. hard to believe how they managed to send a supposedly amazing novel into nothing but a kids fairytale with bad filming...the only thing i probably liked was the special effects of the dragon? They just dashed way too quickly into the movie without letting the viewers settle in one place and let them know the characters.... there were just too many things missing in this film.

A good animation of the dragon, and the dragon rider fight's scene seems believable.However, the fast forward plot would certainty left you to feel like riding a frog, hop from one spot to the next one. And there's an odd feeling when you found that all races (beside the dragon) are totally alike. There's absolutely nothing specific to distinguish these races. Also, what's with the sets (Gilead city, Galbatorix's palace, and Shade's dungeon) ? They all looks like been built on a poor budget. I mean, does this eragon world really is a poor world. There's no sign of any glamors or great buildings at all. For example : Gil'ead was supposed to be a great shore city with buildings designed for battle, complete with a great wall. In this movie I see nothing but a poor fishermen's village (""village"" , not a city !!!!). Not to mention the grinned face you would be doing, every time eragon doing a face touching's scene with his dragon. Those scenes was not believable, cos the animation seems to not mixed well enough with the live characters.Far worse feeling must be felt by those who read the book. The book has been butchered, neutered, and brutally wrecked. None of the movie's plots has the same storyline with the book. Tragically, none of these movie's plots have a similar strength (with the book's plots) in building the story. Everything was messed up and downgraded. I really try to be positive about the movie. But after an hour and about 45 minutes of being annoyed and muttering lots of magic curse, I really can't be positive anymore.(1 hour and 45 minutes !!!! imagine that !!!! HOW MANY COLOSSAL MOVIES that you know, have such a short time duration ?!!!!!). In short story, I as one of the book reader firmly stated a refusal in referring this movie to the book. This movie is complete disaster for the book's translation. I strongly suggest a remake with new script writer, director, and animation studio.",Eragon
411,mortender,They work on a dragonarmor and doesn't use it.,2,3 November 2018,"Saw this movie today. A lot of time waisted with following a stubborn fool with no idea of what he is doing most of the time.The worst scene for me is when he meets the vardens. They work all night to make a dragonarmor for his dragon. Even tho they are running out of time, they still have time to make engravings in it.. but get this.. the next time the dragon comes, it has a completely different armor on with no engraving. Hmm..",Eragon
412,greatgoogilymoo,Enjoyable for what it is,7,18 December 2006,"I had no interest in seeing this movie, but was pleasantly surprised. I didn't know anything about the novel or any of the story going into the movie, so I definitely went in with an open mind. I thought the film was engaging and interesting. I didn't find myself bored or losing interest at all while watching it. The action and all the special-effects looked pretty good, especially considering that the movie is rated PG. I thought Rachel Weisz did a great job voicing Saphira. And Jeremy Irons and John Malkovich were great as usual. And I was excited to see Ben(Christopher Egan)from ""Vanished"" in the film as well. All in all, your typical fantasy adventure movie. Other than that, the only negative comment I have is that it was a bit predictable. Oh, and Joss Stone's performance was unimpressive. I really wish music artists would stop trying to act. Save for maybe a few. But yeah, I would recommend Eragon. Definitely a good flick to check out for the holiday season.",Eragon
413,Gonzo-42,The original is better...,1,30 December 2006,"Or how to take a beautiful Fantasy book and turn it into a shoddy Star Wars (1977) look-alike, ruining it with inane dialogues, glaring blunders in casting, and a total lack of respect of what was written in the book, if anyone of the producers or the director, or the author of the screenplay ever bothered reading it.If you loved the book, stay away from this movie, if you have never read the book, read it and stay away from this movie. Maybe rent Star Wars.I am only thankful that I paid the ticket 3.80 euri and not the full price of 7.50 euri, and that the Japanese dinner afterward was good...",Eragon
414,wendlandj,Some things should not go in a blender,2,20 December 2006,"Here's how I picture it. Some Hollywood producers were brainstorming money making schemes...""Star Wars made a ton of money, and so did Lord of the Rings. We need money like that - big money."" ""Don't forget Harry Potter and the Matrix - they made big money too."" ""We should mix their scripts together - it would be a sure thing.""""Someone will notice - we'll look like idiots."" ""Not if we add another movie - something older so it won't be obvious."" ""How about Highlander? No one remembers that do they?"" ""Good idea - run with it. We're gonna be rich!"" I can't say enough bad about the script. Every step was obvious and inevitable - and you could tell which movie they were copying in each scene. The continuity wasn't even any good. It's bright outside - now it's pouring rain - now it's bright again. Large props appear out of nowhere while they are traveling with no baggage in the wilderness. Everyone conveniently has a second horse with them for when they happen on Eragon...The list goes on and on. This movie was shamelessly patched together out of scraps of formula and the result is about as attractive as Frankenstein's monster. My sympathies to Jeremy Irons, John Malkovich, Rachel Weiss and Christopher Paolini - I'm sure they didn't get any input into this train wreck and their considerable talents were squandered.Points for the dragon animation though - I felt as bad for her as for the live actors which means I totally bought that she was real. She deserved to be in a better movie though.",Eragon
415,nj_yiannis,wasted the opportunity for a great movie,6,20 June 2012,"When I first saw this movie, it was before I read the Inheritance books. I liked the movie and I gave it an 8 out of 10.However few years later I read the books. the books are absolutely amazing. I have now just started reading the last book of the series and I am thinking that the movie wasted the opportunity to achieve the status of the Lord of the Rings trilogy of movies. At one and a half hours it is very shallow compared to the book Eragon. Additionaly it completely changed the course of the story, so unavoidably now if there is a sequel they have to follow another direction.I came back and removed 2 stars from my initial rating because I felt the creators could do so much better with such a great story.Please somebody recreate this movie. It could easily be at least a 3 hour great movie worth a 9 or 10 like the Lord of the rings movies. And then could add easily 3 more movies for the rest of the books. Shame on the creators of this movie. Please somebody remake it.",Eragon
416,jez999,Utterly awful.,1,24 December 2006,"Which of the following are new, interesting ideas in the fantasy genre? Fire-breathing dragons; the unready, humble hero who is chosen for his 'heart', not his fortune or fame; the attractive damsel who is in need of rescue and love; the sacred item that is shrouded in mystery; the old, wise sage who was once a brave hero; the fortune-teller who predicts with the help of some creature's entrails; the daring rescue from a dark castle; the brave hideout of rebels fighting an evil king; the epic battle between Good and Evil.If you said, ""None"" - correct! Maybe one or two would be appropriate in a film coming out today, but by and large they've all been done and something new is required to make entertaining viewing for anyone but the most die-hard fantasy fanatic. Unfortunately, this film is comprised of nothing but the above, and feels like a cut-and-paste job from Lord of the Rings, Harry Potter, and various other well-known epics. The premise, storyline, and dialogue are so thinly worn one could reasonably replace the dictionary definition of 'cliché' with 'Eragon'. It's depressing that people like Jeremy Irons, Rachel Weisz, and Joss Stone got themselves caught up in this, because it sure doesn't live up to their reputations.The film feels like a very bad adaptation, that skims over and/or misses out much of the plot and character development, from a novel that was so boring it should never have been published, let alone turned into a movie. The predictability of the plot and the one-liners is so relentless that at times it was physically painful to watch. Gems such as, ""she is a part of your past, and of your future"", and ""the days of the dragon riders will return"" (5 minutes before they, erm, returned), abound.Don't waste 2 hours of your life watching this rubbish. I regret having done so.",Eragon
417,Foreverest,The PREVIEWS Are Better,1,18 December 2006,"So, my fellow Eragon fans, have you read the popular dragon Inheritance series by Christopher Paolini and couldn't wait to see this movie after the first commercial? Or, are you a die hard dragon fan encouraged to see this new movie that has just recently flown into theaters? As much as it destroys me to disappoint you all, this is one of the worst movies I have seen in a quite a few years.The only good thing I can say about this movie is that it had good special effects. The music to this movie is horrible. The actors and actresses in this movie act like they learned their lines five seconds before shooting. Each scene goes by in two seconds, not giving you a chance to try and like the characters.Movie adaptions from books are never one hundred percent like the original novel. But yet, they should at least follow seventy to eighty percent of the book, am I right? This movie was created like they only read the basic highlights of what happened in the book and I am not joking with you. Some of the biggest characters in the book were wiped off the screen, and half the story didn't even flow right.Every few seconds to a minute they flipped to a new scene, almost like they were 'concerned' with how long the movie would be. If the director hasn't noticed, we're in an age where movies are taken quite a bit more seriously and they are getting longer and longer. They could have made a decent movie if they had spent more time on emotions and characters.I don't even have enough space to complain about every other aspect of this movie(oh, disclosing those pretty effects of course). This movie felt like they were aiming it at ten year olds, and even my eleven year old sister (who read the book and was EXTREMELY excited) HATED this movie. Kids love movies about fighting dragons, and if she didn't even like it, then this movie has been a complete waste of time and valuable cash.You want to see this movie? Don't waste time on the big screen. Rent it and be disappointed.",Eragon
418,nikokul,"Short, bad movie",1,6 January 2007,"I have to agree with the previous comment. Its one of the worst movies I 've ever seen. Eragon finds the egg and next he is already facing The bad one ""Durza"". 90 minutes are simply not enough for a 700 page book.Im really very disappointed and I don't think the second part will be better. Edward Speelers is not bad but something is missing. Jeremy Irons acts like a newbie without any credibility. The only one I liked is Durzas performance. So please don#t waste your money and time and hope for a new Eragon film with Peter Jackson who really knows how to make good fantasy.So this was my comment.I hope you enjoyed it and now I don't know what to write anymore",Eragon
419,thafreaker,I was surprised,7,15 December 2006,"If you read the book, a course the screen version will seem a little different. But it was an okay movie. Kids are going to like this movie, since it is RATED PG. The CGI wasn't that bad. I watched late at night but i was still able to stay awake. It does have some big name actors, how they got them I don't know. John Malkovich must have shot his scene in like a day since he was only on screen for some scenes.I went in with low expectations so it did get a little better as the movie went along. Got some kids, or are a kid go check this one out. Its only about 1hr55 with movie trailers, so the time will go by a bit fast.",Eragon
420,faith294,What a disappointment,1,26 January 2007,"I'm a huge fan of the Christopher Paolini books and was really looking forward to watching Eragon. But I'm afraid after watching that excuse for a movie I was very disappointed. The acting was horrible and the screenplay was even worse. None of the characters were authentic (except maybe Saphira). The Urgals looked like a joke. Throughout the movie I kept getting the impression that they made this film in a hurry. The whole story was a mess. I hope they fix things, or should I say: fire their screenwriter, when they make the next movie. I doubt many people would want to watch it after seeing the first one. They made the book look like an absolute joke. I cant figure out how Christopher Paolini agreed to this. If I was the writer I would consider this movie an insult. My point is, if you're looking for a few laughs, this movie will provide just that with the bad acting. But I was absolutely appalled.",Eragon
421,herospaz,Where did they get this from?,3,16 December 2006,"I am a person who has read Eragon 3 times and knows the story pretty well, but you didn't even have to read it once to tell that they butchered it. That may seem a little strong to you, but I don't even think that they read the book. They didn't include any of the cities Eragon and Brom went to, nor did they show Eragon practicing magic or swordplay with Brom. By trying to cram everything in from a 500 page book to a 100 minute movie was impossible and they shouldn't even have tried. They changed the story around so much because they were trying to fit in into the time, but different people did different thing and the even changed what the Ra'zac looked like. And what was up with them killing the Ra'zac? What's going to happen in the second movie? They didn't even give Arya pointed ears!!! Yet that was the simplest thing they could have done. Oh yes, and Saphira just grew immensely in one flight that in the book took about a month. I'm sorry, but I expected this movie to disappointing, but not this bad.",Eragon
422,xaznpplzx-1,Underrated See The Movie Read The Book,6,14 March 2007,Well I thought it was good. It had okay acting and story was fine even though it was UN-acclaimed. It is totally different from the book (see for yourself). I don't know if that would be good or bad. I found it impressive that a young home schooled boy could write a fantasy like this. Though it came out the same year as the lord of the rings so I find it in a way to be a rip off and that in a way its a Tolkein wanna be but hey at least he tried. Everyone was saying the voice of Saphira was good but i wasn't fond of it. Jeremy Ions had the best acting and he played his character well. Ed Speelers did an okay job to. Though my final opinion is that you would most likely be able to sit through the whole thing and maybe like it a little.,Eragon
423,x_LiveItUp_x,So bad it wasn't even funny...,1,18 December 2006,"I have read the Inheritance trilogy and I love it. I just saw Eragon yesterday. Well, I wasn't expected a great movie, but I was expecting something...watchable. This was the farthest thing from watchable. I would have left had I not been seeing it with friends. Where to begin? Well, first off, I don't see how they can possibly make Eldest into a movie. They left out so many characters and key event (Jeod, the elves, the dwarfs, Hrothgar, the romance between Roran and Katrina, the Twins.) I could go on and on, but I won't. Second, the acting. Ed Speelers may look like a ""perfect Eragon,"" but he can't act. None of the characters-with the exception of Saphira-had any personality whatsoever. Jeremey Irons tried hard, but he wasn't given enough to work with. Saphira, at least, wasn't completely cardboard. But the rest...ugghh. Third, factual errors. Arya is an elf. Arya can do magic. Arya was there when Brom was dying, Arya can heal, Arya could have saved Brom. End of story. At least in the book, it made sense. Eragon just wasn't believable. Example: Murtagh, this guy who he has never met, just shows up out of nowhere. Eragon knows he's been following them, yet he doesn't question why, how, who, etc. He just...trusts this complete stranger who has been following him. Question for you: A complete stranger who you've seen following you walks up and says he'll help you. Do you go with him? No, you don't. That part in particular ticked me off. The characters. Brom died within the first, what, 15 minutes of the movie? He died far too quickly. In the book, Eragon and Brom have been able to trust each other for a while and have bonded. In the movie, they still are complete strangers to another. Arya was made out to be the weak, helpless, beautiful woman who Eragon has to rescue. Arya is so much more than that. The characters were 1 dimensional. There's really no other way to put it. There was no character development. I think the directors and writers tried to make something change within Eragon, but Speelers was such a bad actor, there was nothing.The whole movie was far too fast paced. Eragon meets Murtagh and 1 scene later, he's at the Varden and he's being taken away because he's Morzan's son (Murtagh, not Eragon.) It would not have killed them or the budget to add an extra five minutes in there for more information. Something else that I find unbelievable-even though it's a fantasy movie and is, yes, unbelievable-this broke the fantasy's own laws. Eragon casts this one spell, and after that, without any training whatsoever, he is able to cast five spells in a row? Explain that.Cheesy scenes and dialog, horrible acting, stupid characters. This movie was an insult to the book. The only good thing was that I saw a trailer for what looks like a good movie before Eragon started.",Eragon
424,vivIMOS,Well... not the best movie. except for MURTAGH!,6,2 January 2007,"Wow. 'All my life I dreamed of dragons...' NO! hehe. sorry, too much murtagh on the brain. anyhoo, basically, for years my friends have read eragon, and then eldest, and have recommended them to me over and over. i tried to get into it, i really did, but the beginning of eragon didn't hook me, and i put it down after a couple of chapters. i did the same thing a year later. then, a few months ago, when the commercials for the movie came out, i decided that it looked like a promising movie, and i wanted to be informed. so, i borrowed my lil sisters books, and read eragon right before i saw it, and read eldest right after. personally, i was rather disappointed. the movie ABSOLUTELY POSITIVELY DID NOT follow the book. basically, it was a mediocre movie that let down all the fans, bigtime. *fanfare* BUT WAIT! A SAVIOR HAS ARRIVED!!!!!MURTAGH! lets be honest people, the only thing that made this movie watchable was the gorgeous Murtagh, who will forever live on in our hearts and minds and obsessions YAY! ahem. right. he did not get enough screen time. absolutely not. MORE LATER!",Eragon
425,zerohero76x,Cashing in on Fantasy Trilogy,5,17 February 2007,"I have not read the books but when I saw the movie I was quite disappointed with the lack of originality. I coin the movie Eragon as 'Dragon Heart meets Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope in Middle-Earth'.It was very predictable with the flow of the first 40mins of the movie exactly like Star Wars Ep4. Boy living w ppl other than parents, discovers something special that will change his life forever. Then meets an old / former veteran of an old order whose ways of the glorious days of old are all but extinct due to a betray of that old order. With the treat of the uprising of a new breed... villages r ravaged & burnt. During this time boy is w old man inquiring about the glory days. Later boy discovers that his foster parents r killed & burnt. His immaturity wud have got him killed but he is drawn away by the veteran old man to a journey to fulfill the boys discovery of his destiny.... I can still go on but I thing I'll stop here.The big brit cast was great but a bit under utilized. The physics of the dragon flight & a CG movements were very breath taking. It was the closes experience to actually ride on the back of a flying dragon. The incorporation of the Elven language & its progressive role & development was also a very nice touch to the movie. So other than this, I'd say the movie was really quite bad.Many mentioned that the movie was kind of slow... but it due to the premeditated idea of making trilogy's. I'll go out on the limb & say that Bron will be back in the sequel. The deeper past of Eragons parents & brother will come into the open. These element might either be added to or build into the path of the son of the dragon killer.Young Christopher should have also mention that one of his great influences was George Lucas!! heheh Harry Potter, LOTR,The Chronicles of Narnia, The Bridge to Tarabintha, Eragon... cashing in on fantasy trilogies :)",Eragon
426,hstyrmoe,"Bad story, good acting & directing but has nothing to do with LOTR",6,3 January 2007,"I saw this movie a couple of days ago and aside from the poorly written story, it was an entertaining movie all in all. Why do all of you say that this is LOTR ripoff? Just because the plot is medieval and it contains magic and other supernatural powers/creatures doesn't mean it's a ripoff? It means that no more movies like Eragon can be made, because according to you guys, LOTR has taken patent on it? That's ridiculous ! Stop complaining about this being a LOTR Parody because it's not! All in all I think it's a good movie, and I'm gonna give it a 6/10 just because of the bad plot.",Eragon
427,themollinator,"Blech!! It was kind of, oh I don't know. HORRIBLE?? WARNING: BOOK/MOVIE SPOILERS.",1,9 January 2007,"Uhg!! As a faithful fan of the books I can assure you that the movie was completely awful!! Not even kidding here. The story line just went from one big bang to the next while leaving out the smaller but vastly important character development moments such as the lessons with Brom. They spared once with sticks but there was almost no magic training and the sparring with Zar'roc was not there. Angela, my favorite character, was completely warped. Not to mention almost gone, like poor Solumbum and Orik the Dwarf. If he was there it wasn't enough to be noticed. The Ra'zac looked like some sort of insect/mummy/Wolverine(from X-men) typed thing and Katirina and Hoarst were missing. The relationship between Eragon and Arya is completely different and makes the tension between his infatuation and her status and age completely null and void. I can barely stand to say this, but they flirt the whole movie. Oh, and by the way, she's conscious the whole time :/ Eragon's stay in Tronjenheim is pretty much not there. He just kinda' shows up and they start beating up Urgals/Kull, which look like Jamacan pirates/bikers. I pretty much felt like crying when I walked out of the movie theater. Only a bear hug from my best friend delayed the tears. We were both depressed. I went with one friend that introduced me to the books (we exchanged incredulous looks through out this travesty) and a friend who had never read them. I had to explain things to her several times when a puzzled look crossed her face. The problem was, they didn't explain things. I am curious: did they even bother READING the second book before diving into a movie?? Because I wonder how they are going to make the the sequel. If there is one, please God, NO!!

I was fascinated with, Edward Speleers, the actor who played ""Eragon"" who has only done high school acting. He was pretty good for his first role. Jeremy Irons was the perfect cast for ""Brom."" I wish they could have kept him in longer. I wasn't impressed with John Malkovich in this movie. He was doing the same role type he always has done. Saphira was beautiful and having Rachel Weisz voice her was great. My daughter said she wished she could have the baby Saphira as a pet. It was fun hearing the ""awwww's"" in the audience when the baby was on the screen.",Eragon
430,noahrew-48220,WHY IS EVERYONE HATING ON ERAGON!!!!!!!!!!,10,22 August 2021,This movie was fantastic. It somehow found that perfect balance between making an interesting movie out of a book while not straying too far from the original story line. While there are a few things that could have been better it definitely did not deserve all of the hate it was met with.,Eragon
431,teleplain,Could I give it negative one-million stars?,1,30 December 2006,"Let me start off by saying that, while I have read the book multiple times, I tried to go into the movie with an open mind. I found that it had one merit: the music. Patrick Doyle and the London Symphony Orchestra are a good combination. However, due to the rest of the movie's qualities, the music was tacky. The music on its own is quite enjoyable.Now, as for the characters: the acting, in my opinion, was dreadful. The costumes were of the same quality. Perhaps they would have been all right for a movie about gypsies or a circus, but certainly not for Eragon. They are also unrealistic for a rural medieval setting. Jeremy Irons was the best actor in it, and his part was greatly lessened. Also, while he is a great actor, he was not at his greatest in this film. I think Ed Speleers was cast out of a desire to make him a teen icon, like Leonardo DiCaprio or Orlando Bloom. He does not capture the essence of the poor, medieval farm boy and instead makes Eragon seem like a spoiled brat used to getting his way. Arya, the 'elf', seems to be either a Barbie or a demented ballerina. In the scene where she contacts Eragon through his dream, she twirls and twirls. I could even picture her with a pink tutu. Also, her character, as an elf, would have pointed ears. Murtagh's role in this movie was drastically reduced to just a few scenes. Garrett Hedlund is an American, as are some of the other cast members, but there are many Americans who can at least try to do a British accent. There were about two characters with an American accent, all the rest British. Would it have been so hard to hire a voice coach? Galbatorix, played by John Malkovich, was also extremely upsetting. John Malkovich is very monotone and Galbatorix, in the book, is only mentioned, not actually portrayed. Angela was a great shock. I can only wonder what Angela Paolini, the author's sister and model for the character of Angela, felt about that when she saw Joss Stone dressed as some kind of sparkly gypsy and referring to herself in the third person. Saphira was quite the bit of visual effects. Because of her, I was disappointed in WETA Digital after their amazing work on Lord of the Rings and The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe. Saphira is one of the chief characters in the novel, but in the movie, she serves only to pick at Eragon, fly him around, and take orders from him. The relationship between Eragon and Saphira is supposed to be something incredibly strong. It should be portrayed as a relationship similar to that of a mother and a child and the closest friends. The rest of the characters were improperly dressed and their descriptions were likewise butchered.Now, the plot of the novel and the plot of the movie are two entirely different things. The novel's plot makes sense and flows at a suitable pace. The plot of the movie has only one or two elements similar to that of the book (the Ra'zac and the Varden) and is too slow in some places and too fast in others. Another point that should be brought up is that, if Fox wishes to make Eldest, the sequel, into a movie, there will be no plot. Characters vital to the plot of Eldest were completely deleted from the final version of the film, even if they were cast originally. The characters Katrina, Solembum, Jeod, Gertrude, the Twins, and Oromis are non-existent, though their appearance in Eldest is the only reason for an actual story. Others were killed off, such as Sloan and the Ra'zac. The screenplay of this movie is dreadful. Apparently, the writers were unaware of the 'skills' line used by Eragon and it's connection to Napoleon Dynamite. (It may also be pointed out that Eragon does, in fact, not possess the 'skills' he claims he does.) The lines seem to have been made with the desire of creating some kind of moving, memorable quote with every statement, when the result is bad acting and idiotic characters. The writers make a pathetic attempt at creating interesting characters, but it is in vain. The line ""One part brave, three parts fool"" was repeated multiple times by multiple characters. Another thing that irritated me was the mispronunciation of Alagaesia. It was not just Jeremy Irons who did this, but the entire cast. The proper pronunciation is in the book in the pronunciation guide. Also, much of the Ancient Language was pronounced incorrectly or made up.Due to the nature of this film, I left the theater before the last scene. However, I have since viewed it online and felt nauseous due to the corny dialog. All of those things made me wonder: Did the makers of Eragon even read the book? I advise everyone not to waste their money on such a poor piece of film making. I'm sorry I did.",Eragon
432,hwmerc,Disappointment,1,15 December 2006,"After reading both the first of this trilogy Eargon and the second Eldest, I was looking forward to seeing this first installment on film. If I was Christopher Paolini, I would fly to were the director lived, knock on his door and smack him in the mouth. I would then find thesupposed screen writer and also smack him in the mouth. It is apparent that the director should have stayed employed as a second unit director as he has not yet learned how to be in charge as a director. The dialog was stiff and strained. The movie covered about a week not the 6 months like in the novel. There is almost no background information before important scenes are thrust at you. Example, One scene of Eragon helping Saphira to learn to fly, she flies up and is suddenly now 6 months old from being a week old. She flies down and announces to Eragon that her name is Saphira. Unlike the book where Eragon is the one to name her. There is none of the learning that occurs during the trek to the mountains, ie very little is mentioned about magic and his training with Brom, one quick 30 second scene only. There is no sense of bonding and affection between Saphira and Eragon. There is nothing about the dwarfs, in fact you never see a dwarf in the film. You are never introduced to the Dwarf King and he is not mentioned in the movie. The Varden king does not die in battle, and the beautiful city in the mountain is not there. Arya is still the love interest but doesn't look nor act like an elf and seems to return Eragons affection. Nothing about Eragons near death wound, instead they try to kill off Saphira, nothing about Eragon needing to go to the elf's for further training as a Rider. In fact the movie leads you to believe that he is going to rule the Varden. No mention of any other major plots that ran thru the book. It is unfortunate that this movie that had great promise was doomed by an untried bad director and poorly written screen play. 99 minutes long. It would seem the movie was written and directed to be a movie of the week on some cable station. to allow the rest of the 2 hour block for commercials.",Eragon
433,paladin98001,Eragon is Star Wars coming to Dungeons & Dragons,2,19 December 2006,"Okay, I've given myself time to cool off after seeing Eragon three days ago. I have some good news and some bad news. Okay, the good news first. The good news is that Eragon has spectacular special effects and imagery. Not only that, several parts are superbly acted with a solid story. That's the good news  and the only good news about Eragon. Now, for the bad news. The bad news is the lack of originality of story. The parallels between this story and Star Wars are so alarming that I am surprised that copyright infringement has not been suggested by Lucas Arts. This film is nothing more than the Star Wars story put in a fantasy format. Let me demonstrate  First, we learn of the Dragon Riders and how they kept peace and prosperity across the land (sounds a lot like the Jedi Knights that did the same). Second, we learn that the dragon riders were killed off by a lone, evil, dragon rider that had, can we say, turned to the dark side? That would be Galbatorix (Anakin Skywalker). Third, all the sudden this dragon egg finds its way, magically, to Eragon (Luke Skywalker). Of which Eragon then finds an old sage, former dragon rider and Eragon's trainer, Brom (Obi-Wan Kenobi) before the death of his Uncle Garrow (Uncle Owen). The similarities do not stop there. On the mission to get to the Varden (the Rebel Alliance), Eragon gets sidetracked by an infatuation with Arya (who is a princess just like Princess Leia Organa). Let's see, A-R-Y-A and L-E-I-A  both are four letters even. So, the old sage, Brom, dies early just like Obi-Wan did (both by saving the others, no less). We should not forget the mysterious rogue character of Murtogh (Han Solo) who ends up being in the right place at the right time to make his own contribution and be a small part of seeing to the successful finish (as Eragon's new buddy). I guess that, without reading the books, we can figure out the rest of this story. We will likely find out more of Eragon's family and how maybe dad will show up as being the evil being (laugh). Oh well, the special effects are good but my suggestion is to save your money and watch an old copy of Star Wars! Eragon, as a whole, seems rushed and incredibly incomplete. The director did not even find a real decent stopping point here  unlike Star Wars, Lord of the Rings, etc. Maybe we will only have to suffer through one more installment of this disaster since it looks like this film will barely make budget.",Eragon
434,philippa-grahame,"Book to Film Adaption (mentions events in Eldest, the written sequel, as well)",4,20 December 2006,"Quite honestly, Eragon was a complete and utter disappointment. As lukewarm as I'd been about the book, I'd still felt there was a good chance of it making a decent film  yet it would seem that Hollywood schmaltz has once again stepped up to the plate, stripping the story of all redeeming features in favour of enhancing its mediocrities. The sole and single positive is Saphira, the CGI dragon, but if the best aspect a film can boast lies in its special effects, then that's hardly a recommendation.From minute one, the music is completely overplayed  big, soppy and near continuous, it ruins just about every scene by making melodrama out of otherwise harmless and reasonable dialogue. It's understandable that events would need to be truncated or altered to work on screen, but given that the primary strength of the book was its characterisation, there seems to be little or no sense in the decision to fundamentally alter all the important tensions between the protagonists. Most notably (and displeasingly) is the fact that, rather than keeping Eragon at a distance, Arya is downright flirtatious  one feels that Sienna Guilleroy could've been given a bigger role than in the novel without altering her sentiments. Other changes simply make no sense: why Arya should willingly divulge information about Eragon that she originally withheld under torture is beyond me, as is the decision to alter the entire final battle in order (presumably) to allow for an aerial fight-scene.In heroic films, it is almost impossible to make an opening voice-over sound anything other than pretentious. The fact that one was included is therefore utterly bizarre  not only is it appallingly written, but every single piece of information divulged is explained more naturally during the course of the rest of the film. Perhaps the most disappointing loss was that of Angela the herbalist, originally based on Christopher Paolini's sister. She brought warmth and humour to the story, and could have been made use of  instead, she was reduced to a less-than-believable cameo by Joss Stone, dressed so inappropriately for the character as to boggle the mind.It seems likely that, if enough funding is scraped together to film the next two books, the shoddy treatment of the first will result in serious difficulties. Given the prominent role of Roran in Eldest compared to his bare three minutes in Eragon's opening scenes, one is forced to contemplate the possibility that his entire journey will be swept under the rug or drastically altered, leaving himself (and, we can only hope, the inhabitants of Carvahall) to show up at the finale with almost no explanation whatsoever.All in all, Eragon is a poorly made film. Dragon lovers may wish to see it for Saphira, but I would recommend taking an iPod into the cinema. And possibly a gag (to stop yourself laughing).",Eragon
435,crowgeyb,A poor attempt,4,21 December 2006,"The Elves don't even have pointed ears. The dwarfs are of the same height as humans. I can understand how makers of this film are wiry of producing a movie too similar to Lord of the Rings, however, what elf does not have pointed ears? Besides the lack of following a good storyline and rushing through the whole movie, the score is bad. The end song while the credits play is a pop song. A movie such as this needs music to draw you in where you can spend the next couples of hours away from the real world. All the actors were casted very well, better than Harry Potter, and they all tried hard to make the movie work. Even the dragon's voice was pretty good. If you read the book then you know what is going on in the whole movie, otherwise you will must likely be lost. The writers probably read half the book and decided to make a movie with out seeing what happens in the end. I don't know how possible it is to make Eldest a movie since they screwed Eragon up so bad. Jeremy Irons stole the show, he is probably the only reason to go see this movie.",Eragon

I hope he learned his lesson and he will include a clause to have final word on the adaptation of his future books. I mean, Eragon is not a great book, but it's pretty good and the adaptation just sucks.Very disappointed.Too much for a first time director that jump from the FX world. And Peter Buchman, please at least, take the Robert McKee course, for the sake of film-making.What would you think are the best adaptations ever?",Eragon
437,One-Way,I wanted to walk out on this one,1,22 December 2006,"I would like to follow up with the rest of the reviewers.This movie is a huge disappointment. If you have read the book, the only thing you will recognize are the names. The story line has been so butchered it is not even clear what they wanted to do with it. Even with the book knowledge it was hard to follow or understand what was going on,,, without it,... I doubt you would have a clue of what is going on.Every aspect of this movie has been changed from the book, but beyond that the lines are contrived, it has the feel of a porno. The costumes are just down right funny; from Roran wearing what appears to be blue jeans to elves with no pointy ears and dwarfs that are just bearded men. Better yet was one of the huge secrets of the book was that, Arya was the princess of the elves.. however in the movie she introduces herself to Eragon as ""princess of Ellesmera"" and there is no mention of Eragon going to train with the elves, but rather being the new leader of the Varden.I actually have to recommend that you never see this movie if you can help it. It is not worth a $1 to rent. It is utter junk.",Eragon
438,olsonfamk,"fun for some, not for all ( a good overall film!)",7,6 January 2007,"Overall, I liked this film. There were a few big problems that I found annoying. For some characters, they didn't seem to give them enough screen time for us to really like them (Roran, Uncle Garrow, exc.). The Urgals were FAR too human(not at all like the book). They had to take out some of the stuff that was in the book, and they added some stuff that wasn't in it in the first place. Fans of the book might be a little bit disappointed at this movie ( an understatement for some). On the other hand, there were it's good points. Except for the fact that you know that dragons don't exist, Saphira looks real and is a believable character who effectively reacts with her environment. Some of the actors gave excellent performances, while others not so good ( I personally liked Ed Speleers/Eragon ). It doesn't do too bad of going by the book, they just could've done better. So if you haven't read the book and like Sci-fi/fantasy movies, then you'll love this movie(hopefully). As for the readers, just remember that they can't do everything right and you have to appreciate it for what they put in. So now that you know what I think, watch it for yourself, and don't take it too seriously ( I definitely recommend the book, for it is really awesome!).",Eragon
439,archangelh,Could be better,6,7 January 2007,"I read the book and headed to the film with great anticipation. I was disappointed to find that the screen-writer had desecrated the film, by not only changing the story line dramatically, but by adding romance where it just didn't fit. The movie would have been better if the director had started off on something slightly smaller in scale. The actors, while several where new simply needed better direction. All in all it wasn't too bad, and the flying sequences where the best part of the film by far. I enjoyed it but beware that you will be disappointed, especially if you've read the novels. Those who have; we can only hope that the sequel will be better.",Eragon
440,x-angel-o,high expectations and was sadly disappointed,2,13 January 2007,"***There may be spoilers***OK. Let me start off by saying what was good about the movie. I thought the special effects were done pretty well. I think they could have been a bit better, but you can only do as good as special effects as you can with the amount of money you have. I also thought that Rachel Weisz did a wonderful job as the voice of Saphira.I was expecting this movie to be one of favorites, up with Lord of the Rings. I was, sadly, disappointed. They touched upon everything (when I say touched, I mean touched) but they didn't go in depth. I thought there could have been much more character development and they could have taken the time to show the relationship between the characters more. You didn't really get the sense that Eragon had a major crush on Arya, and the strong relationship between Eragon and Saphira wasn't very evident. They also didn't follow the story line very well. The movie was only an hour and a half (roughly), and they could have included and extended scenes to make the movie better. The movie could have been much better if it was 2 and half hours. I thought they made the movie very airy-fairy, and not at all as dark as the books are. I know they couldn't make the film look like Lord of the Rings or Star Wars (mainly Lord of the Rings), but they still could have added more and made it original. One thing that really bothered me was that Eragon had no training. He just became and amazing dragon rider over night. And Arya didn't have pointed ears. I don't think anyone who hadn't read the book knew that Arya was an elf because elves are usually distinguished because of their pointed ears. I thought the acting could have been somewhat better, but it wasn't horrible. The sets could have looked better as well. There were some scenes where I just thought the sets looked horribly fake. The missed key parts and changed key things as well that if Eldest is to become a movie, they will have a very hard time. They will end up ruining the second book as well.Overall, I thought the movie wasn't very good. The trailer made the movie look amazing, and it didn't live up to it.",Eragon
441,Sharingan_Kakashi,Not expecting anything? Then don't watch it!,1,14 January 2007,"I heard the books were great. Now, I know for a fact that no movie really captures the essence of a well written book, but sometimes there is a little appreciation for whats done. At least, it would make you more interested in researching some detail you think the book might be able to explain better. Eragon does NOT!!! My friend gave me the first book to read right before the movie came out, so obviously I went to watch the movie first. One, it had dragons and two, SIENNA GUILLORY was starring in it. There was no new upcoming great acts from any of the cast. No new upcoming OK acts either. Not recommended at the least from me as I was SHAMED when coming out of the theatres from dragging my friends into what I thought might be a ""GRRREAT"" movie. It was the quietest and longest ride back home from the theatre. EDITORS NOTE: When Sienna doesn't have a jaw dropping first appearance (I just mean she didn't look hot!) in the movie (like in Resident Evil 2), then there is something wrong already.

So you can imagine that I was pleasantly surprised when I saw that there was to be a movie made based on the novel. However, I was dismally disappointed and actually quite frustrated too upon seeing the movie in the cinema. There are a lot of holes in the movie, the storyline races through the events, the dialogue is utterly unrealistic and without depth. I do not understand how one can totally mess up a movie when you have a good story and pretty good special effects (they did a good job with the dragon) and obviously the budget to make a decent movie. For somebody who has not read the novel, the movie must be quite confusing because of the holes and the unexplained unfolding of events. I always say it myself: if you go to the movies expecting a lot, you are bound to get disappointed. Although I had read the reviews on the movie before going, they were quite negative, I still had an inkling of hope that it could not be that bad. Well, I am here to tell you that it was and don't waste your time seeing it. Although I must confess, deep down, I hope that the movie makers have learned their lesson and will do a better job with part two (the Eldest). What can I say, I am the ultimate optimist.",Eragon
444,overburn_rasial,"Movies should be a refuge from reality, not always inspired by it",10,12 February 2007,"After seeing all the movies that have hit the market since 2000, i'd have to say that i'm rather disappointed with most of them. Most of the films reflect reality, but isn't reality what we're fleeing from when we want to relax, see a movie? The first Eragon book was written when the author was only 15 years old. Maybe that's why the movie is the best I have seen in years. Sometimes, children have a better view of what life should be like than adults. They are not so worn up by the hard parts of life. They live in their own imaginary world where anything is possible. Brom's death was really touching, not like in the movies where a character just dies, the other characters weep for 5 minutes and are back to their life. Don't you people understand that we don't need to see the cruel reality we see during our everyday lives?To conclude, this movie has a 10 from me. But most of that 10 goes to the book. The movie was an interpretation of the book, and the way the book is implemented into this film is outstanding.6 points to the book 4 points to the movieTogether they make a 10.",Eragon
445,darrenturner-1,terrible,1,21 February 2007,"I'm seventeen and read Eragon and Eldest over the summer at the urging of a friend. My reaction to the books was surprise! Granted that Christopher Paolini is no Tolkien or Robert Jordan the book was very enjoyable and is one of my personal favorites. When learned that a film adaption would be arriving soon I was excited and eagerly awaited it's coming. I saw it a week after it's opening day with a friend and his younger brothers all of whom have read it and to put it mildly I was extremely disappointed. At several points we all actually broke out in loud and hysterical burst of laughter, rude? yes but understandable. First of all while I know that a movie adaptation of a book will always have it's differences, this film crossed the line. It is as if someone read the back cover of the book and wrote the screenplay off of that it was that bad. The entire tone off the story was altered completely. It left out about 85% of the story and what it did have it butchered making it look like a cheap rip off of Star wars which it really isn't.It also makes it impossible for there to be a sequel that even resembles Eldest. The acting was awful mainly due to the terrible script that was filled with lame and weak lines such as ""In to the sky to live or die!""I mean come on. I suggest that if want to see this film wait to rent it because it definitely not worth theater prices. I will be attending film school next year and am already working on a remake screenplay so hopefully in a few years this one will be forgotten and another one will be made.",Eragon

First thing I noticed was the horrible, boring dialogue. This is one of those movies you watch late at night on Mystery Science Theater because the comments that can be made is more entertaining. Second, the main character seems too detached from his character which didn't make it even slightly believable. The writers should be taken to the back lot and shot. I could do better writing the entire script in one night. Finally, I noticed something rather disturbing. The basic story has a strong resemblance to Star Wars. Even scarier was that my mom also noticed this. I really hope this is nothing like the book. This was a movie that had great potential that ended up as just a huge disappointment.",Eragon

But if you take this movie just for what it is: an hour and a half fairy tale with some brilliant special effects and some of the coolest actors ever to grace Hollywood (Jeremy Irons and John Malkovich), then this is a movie worth divulging an hour and a half of your time to.

448,y2bbelsh,Not Very Good,4,18 December 2006,"I would totally agree with lemonfreax assessment of this movie. They got the review of this movie absolutely spot on. If you have read the book you will be very disappointed with this movie. I read the book when it was first released and loved it. I was intrigued by the whole story around of it, the characters, the homeland the troubles and strives they got in. So naturally when I received an email saying it was being made into a film I was delighted. I was eagerly awaiting the release for months, in which time i read the book 2 further times to keep myself up with the story. As I was sat in the cinema 20 mins into the film I was utterly disappointed with what I was watching. How can such an in-depth book be turned into a film that lasts just and hour and half? This needs to be up there with Lord of The Rings film length. The film doesn't give u time to think about what is going on, and this should happen. You don't get to know much about the characters, which you should be allowed to do. Even seeing the Dragon is a let down because again they changed the whole process of which she was hatched and brought up. All the way through the whole film it seems as if you are going in fast forward, rushing from one scene to another, I just do not understand why they did it this way. I don't for 1 second think Christohper Paolini is pleased with he outcome of this. They have ripped the book apart and left huge parts out, parts that are important to the rest of the film.",Eragon

451,Stardust_4,What's the word I'm looking for here?...Cheesy...embarrassing...ah! I've got it! Pathetic!,2,24 November 2007,"Okay, I'll be honest. I had seen 'the Lord of the Rings' and 'Narnia', so I went to see this movie in the cinema with high hopes. At first it seemed great, but now I have had time to think about it, I can only say: what an unnecessary waste. For a plot line with potentially enough ingenuity and atmosphere to rival the Chronicles of Narnia and even come close to the lofty position of the Lord of the Rings trilogy, so much is wasted in this movie. For a start, the producers so mangled the plot line, and they took so much out and messed up so much of the remaining story, that after the first 15 minutes or so the story became practically unrecognisable. I have absolutely no idea how on earth they are going to do a sequel, they left that much out. Then they screwed the map up. Where was the city of Teirm? Or Yazuac? If in the book the Empire is mostly plains and desert, why was 80% of the movie filmed in the mountains and in forest? Where on earth was Tronjheim, the Dwarvish City? I have a suspicion that the producers got as far as the introduction of Eragon himself, then decided that they couldn't be bothered to bring the rest of the plot genuinely to screen, so bumbled along with a weak storyline, half-hearted acting attempts by MOST of the cast, and completely off-the-point dialogue, dragging us along with them. Oh, and before I forget- whoever wrote the script deserves to be shot.To get started, Durza (the Shade) did all the villainy in the film, whereas the King Galbatorix (played by a woefully miscast John Malkovitch) just sits on his throne and muses ""There is a new Dragonrider"" over and over. Durza did NOT have a ""dark magic"" dragon to ride on in order to battle Eragon, either. Then, the Ra'zac did NOT look the way they were supposed to, they were NOT servants of Durza, and they did NOT both die in the book. The Urgals (the thugs/soldiers) looked like some weird genetic interpretation of Stone-Age men, AND WHERE WERE THEIR RAM'S HORNS? Arya (the Elven princess- although I can hardly say this is told in the film; we are just told she is the princess of Ellesmera, leaving those who have not read the book in the dark) did not behave the way she did in the book at all! Brom, the wise old Dragonrider, played (for a change) rather well by Jeremy Irons, had his character messed up too. He was NOT supposed to kill one of the Ra'zac, he was the only one in the whole movie who could speak the Ancient Language of magic (apart from Durza-another hint as to why he is portrayed as the main villain instead of the King) and then only 4 words, and he even had his death turned around! Saphira, the dragon (again voiced superbly by Rachel Weisz) did NOT breathe fire as soon as she did in the movie, she was ABSOLUTELY NOT supposed to grow from a baby dragon into a fully-grown dragon in 5 seconds (I was completely lost for words at that point in the movie!) and since when do dragons have feathers? And as for Eragon himself- well. Don't get me started. And in terms of characters, I personally view it as sacrilege (and I know other viewers on IMDb agree with me) that the producers should undertake a task such as this, AND THEN LEAVE OUT HALF THE MAIN CHARACTERS! It seems that with the basic and absolutely necessary characters filled out, the film producers couldn't, wouldn't or didn't (I don't know which) give the others the plot space they needed in order to keep the story going. Some people were left out completely. Where was Orik, the Gimli of the story? And the Twins? Angela the sorceress, apart from being in the wrong place, and having her dialogue and plot line thinned down to the point of collapse, even had her werecat abolished! And when they did include some characters, they chipped away at their role-plays so much that if this film had been a complete original, without the book (and I admit, it would have been an altogether better and less-criticised film if it was), I would have seen absolutely no point in introducing such random characters at random points throughout the movie. Murtagh, for example, saved Eragon and Arya from Durza's prison, but in the book he is quickly developed into a mature and vital person in the present life of both Eragon and Saphira. True, they kept the saving from the prison, and true, they kept his ancestry from Morzan (the traitor of the Dragonriders) in the film, but in it he seems more like some kind of freakish stalker who simply joins in for fun! And Ajihad, the general of the rebellious Varden- where was most of his screenplay? As well as Hrothgar, the Dwarf King- I didn't even recognise him until the film had nearly ended. He did not even look like a dwarf! Angela saw her part thinned down, as did Nasuada, Ajihad's daughter- she just turns up, then leaves! Roran, Eragon's cousin, was got out of the way exceedingly quickly too. There are numerous other faults, but the word limit on IMDb reviews won't allow me to put them down in writing. So, in the end, I have three pieces of advice: First, to Christopher Paolini, keep up the good work, and best of luck with the third book. Second, to you readers, avoid the film, read the book (honestly, you will like it if you enjoyed Narnia), and look forward to the second and third books. And thirdly, to you producers, and director Stefen Fangmeier, next time you do a novel/film adaptation, READ THE BOOK FIRST!",Eragon

Avoid at all costs.From the telegraphed plot to it's wooden acting and infantile writing it is hard to believe that this movie was released. This movie reinforces my view of the business of Hollywood. A business so lacking in originality that it can not objectively see this movie as the piece of crap that it is. I can just hear the pitch. ""It's Lord of the Rings with Dragons"" If the studio spent a 1/10th of the time actually reading the script and fixing it rather than focusing on product tie-ins and merchandising we might have been given a pleasant, but forgettable, piece of escapism.

It has some of the best special effects that I've seen in a while. While I wish it could've stayed a little more to the book, Eragon was worth 6$. After I'd finished watching the movie, I kept thinking why I hadn't gone to see Eragon it theaters.I'd give it 3 out of 4 for story. 4 out of 4 for special effects.

455,rn_light_under_darkness,Decent at best,6,18 November 2007,"***Spoiler warning*** When I saw this movie last year, it had first came out. I thought to myself, 'well ya know... The books are great and they have a decent guy to direct it'. I went out and watched it. I've read a lot of reviews on the movie and they all had the same thing to say, ""the actors are horrible, except for Saphira"" While this is true, it isn't the fault of the actors, they did the best with what they had to work with (bad writing is the downfall of the movie). It has a lot of clichés, but another thing it has is pretty decent special effects. It does have some bad acting, I will admit to that. The scene where Eragon is going to save the elf from the prison, he has contacts in and can barely see, so it looks like he's squinting. Poor acting on a whole from the younger generation of actors. The guy who played Brom (Jeremy Irons) is quite an experienced actor, starring in a number of films, The Three Muskateers, for one. The man who played Galbatorix(John Malkovich) played co-star to our Brom in The Three Muskateers, and also in the movie Knockaround Guys. But, the ""lack luster"" acting brings the movie down quite a bit. They also seem to forget to add in key parts of the books, while they can't be perfect, I wish they could've added in more aspects to the movie, bring in several people from the book that don't even get a mention. How do they intend to keep to the books. They reveal that ""Arya"" is an elven princess, when Eragon and Saphira don't find that out until the next installment of the series. The ""witty banter"" between Durza and Arya is uncalled for and doesn't add anything to the movie, just the writers attempts at... I dunno, comic relief? It doesn't make sense because as far as the viewers that are watching the movie (without having any prior knowledge of the books)know they had never met before, seeing as Ajihad never mentioned the fact that he had fought the Shade before. So in my opinion, a sub par movie, decent in some parts and lacking in others, I wouldn't exactly run out right away and buy a copy, but if you're in need of a movie fix, it could provide some entertainment.",Eragon
456,BamaLuvar,Last Choice,5,25 April 2008,"I read the book and was excited when I found out they were making it into a movie. I have to say, though, i was quite disappointed. You may enjoy this movie if you haven't read the book, but I wasn't happy leaving the theater. I feel as though if you read the book you should probably see it just to get an idea of what others might imagine when reading it. This was not what I imagined when I read the book. I suggest for you to rent a different movie such as a Harry Potter or even The Series of Unfortunate Events movie before you rent this movie. Like I said was very disappointed. This is what I call a ""Last-Choice"" movie. Only watch if you can't find anything else to watch. Not a great movie, but not horrible.",Eragon
457,creativeangel2007,Hated this movie....H-A-T-E-D it,1,16 October 2008,"I used to like the book. Though the storyline seemed copied and pasted from other stories (aka plagarised, such as the description of Hrothgar's's hall-does that not sound exactly like Lord of the Rings?) it was not at all badly done considering Christopher Paolini was fifteen when he wrote it (and inspired me to begin an attempt at a novel myself if you must know). I was severely disappointed in the movie however, and had it not been for my naivety and lost hope that it would get better, I would have stopped within a few minutes.The plot was destroyed. The dialogue was terrible. The characters were completely unlikeable (Eragon himself was whiny before mind you, but Arya wasn't supposed to be all...ditsy)and just...gagh!!! I hated the movie. Really, that's my point...if you enjoyed this movie, all the power to you, but I myself will never get over what a terrible movie this was.",Eragon
458,albertosanchezmd,Could have been written by a 7 year old.,1,21 December 2006,"I expected to be surprised by the imagination of a young new writer, but this movie was mostly a collection of brain-dead clichés. Luckily for the author ""there's a sucker born every minute,"" as P.T. Barnum was attributed to have stated it. Besides, having a really dumb storyline, the ""actor"" chosen for the main human character had neither personal charm nor acting talent; and the voice given to the main dragon in the story can be described from non-attractive to rather annoying. At the end of the movie, reflecting about the large amounts of money this story has generated for his author and associates, I was actually surprised that given the large number of morons in the world there are not so many more bestsellers like this one.",Eragon
459,Reviewafilm,The full review - Eragon,4,22 November 2009,"Well, i had the movie but i said to myself that i would finish reading the book before i watched the film. I thoroughly enjoyed the book and i knew that the film would be great. I was wrong. For those people like me that really don't like those inaccuracies from your favourite books to films, this one will really annoy you. There were so many inaccuracies in this film it was unbelievable. First of all, Saphira grew to a massive size in a couple of seconds, whats with that? And the dragons did not have scales, they had things which looked oddly enough like feathers. Brom was the one who ended up burning down Garrow's house, because he was dead and wanted to rid the evidence; why? Oh and the Ra'Zac were not hooded, neither did they look ANYTHING remotely like what Paolini described, and for some reason one of them was killed by Brom. And the event where Eragon first utters ""Brisingr"" is merged with a completely different part of the story. We actually see Galbatorix a lot when he only talked about, and that goes for the rest of the evil side, we are NOT supposed to know what they are doing. And Durza didn't look like the shade i imagined, he looked like someone who just got out of a pub fight because of his hair. The urgals are too small for what Paolini described, and they look too much like humans. There are many many more inaccuracies in this film, but I'm not going to bore you with any more, or break my keyboard doing so. The amount of problems in this film really annoyed, me as you can tell, so much that i never gained interest in the film at all. If you have not read the book you would probably enjoy it more. On a lighter note, this is a good family entertainment film for those who do not care about these inaccuracies. Children will definitely enjoy this film as it does hit home with the fantasy aspect. The computer generated graphics are superb, the landscape and costumes are excellent, and the acting is good. And because of these reasons its a four. And for those who said the ending was too open and nothing happened, you do know there is, when the fourth is released, four books, right? Oh and because this film was thought of as ""terrible"" by those who love Paolini's books, there wont be a movie sequel. And if you ask me, once the fourth book is released a GOOD company should work closely with Paolini to make all four films the way the readers imagine it.",Eragon
460,minerethan,Horrible.,1,1 April 2009,"This movie was nothing like the book; they visited a town that was never visited in the book-i forget what town it was at the moment-Saphira had feathers on her wings instead of them being a leathery membrane, Eragon was taught true-naming and if you don't know what that is-its the true names of the elements and everything that lies within them so you can control them, The elves didn't have tapered ears and that being one of the only well defined obvious physical differences from humans they should have had the correct ears, dwarfs were about 6 Feet tall instead of being more like 3 or 4 feet tall, the raz'ac looked like people in costumes, they had no beaks and no feather, they looked like they were wrapped in leather. When i first saw previews for this movie i was excited and hoping they were going to do it like Lord of the Rings, the production quality was far less than Lord of the Rings, i would think they only spent 100k in the making. This movie was horrible, its a complete insult to the book and it writer, i just wish Christopher Paolini would have had more of a hand in the making of the movie and maybe the rape of a great book through film could have been prevented.",Eragon
461,SonOfTheDark,No Dragonheart,4,18 December 2006,"I haven't read the book, so I won't make compare it with the big-screen adaption. In any case the script of the movie is pretty bad! A shallow and excursive plot with one-dimensional characters as well as rather bromidic dialogue. The ending comes fairly abrupt and unspectacular. You are left behind with mixed feelings and it seems like some key elements and sequences have been cut out, so suspense and dramatic don't really come up! Visually the film is indeed pretty good and the dragon is nicely done, but thats almost the only positive things. There is not much new stuff, a lot of the landscape shots are known from ""The Lord of the Rings"", but in better form. The music is nothing special and it even fails to translate the tension or emotion in some scenes.Most of the good actors are totally lavished in short, uninteresting roles, particularly John Malkovich and Djimon Hounsou! Only Jeremy Irons has something to do and a few good moments as the mentor, but thats all. Sienna Guillory is nothing more than a beautiful extraction. Speelers is not really a weak point in the leading role, but his part isn't written very well too...I expected more from a movie with this budget and this cast. Unfortunately ""Eragon"" is an average fantasy film without heart and depth! I would only watch a sequel with a different writer and director...4 out of 10 Dragons",Eragon
462,abby_spice,"Good idea, Bad execution",3,11 January 2011,"The Eragon series of books, by Christopher Paolini, is an epic series, with interesting characters, vast series, and an intricate story-line.This movie, unfortunately, is not the series of books. Indeed, it seems that the makers of the movie did not even read Paolini's works, as it is almost completely inconsistent with the book (Only the names have not been changed!). For one thing the Elf and Dwarf race are entirely absent from the movie, as are the vast landscapes and cities. Even the dragon is different from the books.In addition, since what is supposed to be an epic story-line is crammed into less than two hours, there isn't enough time for adequate character development, and everything seems rushed.This could have been a good movie. There is something about having a dragon as a best friend that appeals to the child in all of us, and the movie had good music and a good voice over of the dragon, with the animations of the dragon perfectly syncronized to the voice-over. Unfortunately the movie is inadequate in the worst way. I only hope that someone will see fit to remake this into the epic, LOTR style movie that it should be, instead of the catastrophe that it is.",Eragon
463,paulo_bas,What a mess...,1,27 June 2012,"Well let's see. If I had Sienna Guillory and Jeremy Irons (not including Joss Stone) as a cast, one of the best books in the world and an awesome GCI what would I do? Of course I would ruin the whole story wouldn't I? I'm sure that if someone tried harder to ruin the story even more than Mr. Peter Buchamn did, that someone would fail. Because it is hard. It's very very hard to ruin a story like that. I mean, none of the original story was used. They took Eragon, dragons and a bad king, but they re- invented the whole thing. So my score to the crew is negative. The main actor just sucks, very unrealistic (not to expect much than it) and failed in every level. The other thing i think failed was Angela... Really? From an old woman to an exotic vident? Come on you can do better. However there are two good aspects in the movie. The first one is Saphira. Though the voice sucked (and it was made by Rachel Weisz) the GCI was just awesome!! THe part when the egg cracks is the best part of the movie. The other thing that saved the movie from being a hopeless mess was Arya. Sienna Guillory is the most gorgeous actress ever to set foot in Hollywood. Very underrated though and I really hope that that changes.John Malkovich meh. It's not his fault that the movie sucked. In fact, King Galbatorix never appeared in the books until the last one. Wrong placement.Long story short. It sucked.",Eragon

I honestly don't know what to make of this movie, it's not that it had a bad story line - it just didn't have any! Even the big names couldn't save this movie - John Malkovich, Rachel Weisz, Jeremy Irons! Who is Edward Speelers? And why?? Now let's not compare Eragon to (dare I say it) Lord of the Rings. No, let's not even compare it to Dungeons and Dragons or Dragonheart or the TV series Beastmaster. I wont go there.Eragon contains all the required recipe for a fantasy movie: dragons, bows and arrows, blond star, damsel in distress, elves and evil villains, camera angles... the works.The scene starts with some random fight that's supposed to make the viewer connect with the characters (failed), then the supposedly cute dragon when it hatches. The hero, with a cheesy smile, is undoubtedly destined to save a girl or two and hence the world.That pretty much sums up the story.3/10 is generous.",Eragon
465,maconforti,"Another ""butchery of a good book"" movie",1,6 March 2007,"I have not seen this movie and I refuse to subject myself to it.I have read both of the books, Eragon and Eldest, that this movie was based on. Although Paolini may not be the greatest of writers he did in fact write a great story. It's some great fantasy, comparable to that of The Lord of the Rings.The only way a movie could do these books justice would be to have it made into parts just like Peter Jackson did with The Lord of the Rings. It is an epic tale.The books were great fun to read leaving wonderful imagery in my mind and at times pulling me so deeply into the story that I became emotionally attached to the characters. It was truly a great story.After viewing the few pictures of this movie here on IMDb I can tell you that they in no way fully bring out the beauty of Arya, the awe of Saphira, and the man that Eragon had become after his transformation brought on by the power of the dragons.If you have seen this movie and have not read the books then you have missed out on one of the best fantasy stories of humans, elves, dwarfs, dragons and a host of other species. Do yourselves a favor and read the books.",Eragon
466,JiffyB,let the book down,3,27 April 2013,"Having just recently read the books, I was excited to see that the first one has been made into a film. However, I was severely disappointed. The screenplay and the script were terrible. Key characters that are integral to the plot were either not present or given minor appearances. The characters that did appear were poor imitations of what they should have been which was a shame as there was some fantastic actors cast. one of the clever techniques in the books was to keep Galbatorix veiled in a bit of mystery but this film just went in the complete opposite direction with that. Important parts of the plot were also missing. Basically the film was a shambles but I hope that one day it gets picked up again to be remade by someone who has a better understanding of the books because the books really would make fantastic films.",Eragon
467,onegreenbee,Good movie to see...to avoid Christmas crowds.,8,17 December 2006,"After having read a few of the comments about this movie, I felt compelled to add a few thoughts.First of all, I have NOT read the book. Not because I wasn't interested, just no time. I am a teacher and I know a lot of students have read and enjoyed this book. Having said that, I understand that the book-to-movie translation was, of course, less than perfect.However, the movie was pretty good. They brought in an unknown actor for the main character which I appreciated. Jeremy Irons and John Malkovich were there for strong presences, although I would have like to have seen a little more of them. It had a good storyline and was pleasant to watch. You cannot compare this movie to LOTR...to do so would be an injustice. This movie, I admit, seems to have a similar theme running through it, but it is not in the same league as a book that had legions of fans following it for many years.I think the biggest problem this film had was that it was not long enough. To make an epic-type movie, it should be AT LEAST two hours long. This enables you to really empathize with the characters and form attachments. I am not sure why they decided to make it this short, but I can only hope that the next one will be longer.",Eragon
468,nikajan,"not terrible, but disappointing",5,25 January 2007,"Translating a book into film is not an easy task, but this could have been done better. i didn't expect the film to be totally true to every event in the book, but they could at least have kept the sense of the book and the integrity of the characters. The storyline comes across as rushed, there is no sense of the passage of time. This would not have been hard to incorporate. THe film also felt as if they had cut scenes out, there is quite a disconnected feel to the story at times. The characters lose a lot of their depth, you don't feel you know them, and you just don't care. And why didn't Arya, the elf, have pointy ears? It isn't a bad movie, as such, but they could have done so much more with what they were given. Great special effects do not compensate for a storyline with a good flow.",Eragon

Jeremy Irons is the only good thing in this movie... when he isn't on screen, there is nothing to watch. Also... the kid playing Eragon, how could you use him to base multi-million dollar project around, he has two expressions. Most of the big name cast had less than five minutes of screen time... huh?

The dialogue and music cancelled each other out making for utter noise during the course of the whole movie.. or was it the crying kids who saw a novel dismantled before there very eyes?

The dragon didn't look that good, oh yeah, 300 million will get you a better dragon.

Jeremy Irons was overcome with the cheese from the acting of Edward Speelers. Speelers might have been a better actor, but the director was incompetent, failing to make such an epic fantasy into a good movie. sad. eragon had LOTR potential. i think it should be remade. don't watch this movie, will waste your time. even if you are looking to waste time. MUCHOS HORRIBLE ! If they ever decide to remake the movie in the near future, casting the same cast might work but you have to take out a couple of parts and add some. along with addition and subtraction of some actors will make this movie great.*****SPOILERS START HERE*****Some differences are alright but changing the whole thing doesn't work. Do not start the movie with a cheesecake of an intro. And put Eragon in the Spine and not his home. They make it look like that he went out for a casual hunt in the backyard rather than the audience/reader absorbing hunt in the book. And also, the army never came to take young men away. Carvahall was supposedly the out of the way village. What happened to the mighty Horst? When did he become a weasel? Traders? Katrina? The razaac don't die even in the second book, but what is going on. And since when did Eragon get the special ability to use Saphiras vision whenever he wanted? Wasn't Brom supposed to teach a lot of stuff to Eragon. And Durza couldn't control what Eragon saw in his dreams. What happened to Joed, no what happened to Terim? Yes, it wasn't included. Arya was never conscious to talk to Eragon, but till the end. And Angela was smart and witty and not a hula dancer. what about the werecat? What about Dras Leona and Hellgrind? And when did Saphira grow in size after getting hit by lighting? I think it was the directors way of saying that Saphira grew large in size LIGHTNING FAST!!! these are just a few of the things that were missing. As the story goes on,there are more to point.

You know big pictures with a pink dragon and dragon rider with sunset in heroic countryside that you buy on a market in Amsterdam. The plot is however as thin as a poster. That is not all; a narrator will tell you everything as well in case you are blind.

474,JStiles85,"I didn't think it was bad, but then again, I like Dragonheart",7,23 March 2007,"I'm going to start this review with a few disclaimers that may ""discredit"" me in the eyes of some readers. 1) I have not read the novel, so I can't make any judgments on how it holds to that (although I generally don't try to hold movies to their novel counterparts due to limiting factors that for the most part cannot be avoided) and 2) I happen to like another dragon movie people bash a lot: Dragonheart. With those things said, on to my review.I went into this movie with an open mind, trying my best to block out the mixed reviews I've heard (some of my friends loved it, the internet at large seems to hate it), and I was pleasantly surprised.Acting/Dialog/Script - The acting was on par with the genre. It's an unavoidable truth that the script and the acting will seem bad in fantasy and science fiction if the audience is unwilling to suspend disbelief. One has to take into account that this is a fictional land, and therefore the speech patterns may be a bit out of our norm. In addition, as a fantasy, the dialog is usually over-dramatized in order to press a higher sense of consequence. If one honestly looks at it, the same things that people are complaining about with this movie are present in such highly exalted films as Star Wars and LOTR.Plot - As far as the storyline goes, I liked it. It could use a little bit of fleshing out and expansion, but it has a good solid backstory that really gives that sense of medieval lore that drives so many good fantasy stories. Other than the plot seeming a little rushed from time to time, it really does have a good solid feel to it.Special effects/battle sequences/etc - Nothing here particularly ""blew me away"", but it certainly didn't leave me sitting there thinking how fake it all looked. There are a few shots during battle where the camera changes almost made me sick, but it was visually exciting.Overall, I would call Eragon a good piece of entertainment. If you're looking for an Oscar quality amazing drama, this is not it, for that I would recommend The Departed (which I also just watched recently), but if you're looking for a fun story with dragons, sword fights, archery, and a tyrannical monarchy that must be overthrown, Eragon is your film.",Eragon
475,moonhawk64,Star Wars - Fantasy Style,5,20 July 2010,"Generally, the movie is well-done, but I can't get past the fact that it's too much a fantasy version of Star Wars: A New Hope.

A young farm-boy, Eragon, finds the Artifact, which is an egg which contains a dragon, then finds a mentor, Brom, to teach him the ways of the Riders, then Eragon's uncle is killed by the Raz'ac, who are looking for the egg (A young farm-boy, Luke Skywalker, finds Artoo, which is a robot which contains the plans to the Death Star, then finds a mentor, Obi-Wan, to teach him the ways of the Jedi, then Luke's uncle {and aunt} are killed by the Stormtroopers, who are looking for the plans). Arya is captured and sent to the castle to be tortured; she is rescued by Eragon, but in the ensuing fighting, Brom is killed (Leia is captured and sent to the Death Star to be tortured; she is rescued by Luke, but in the ensuing fighting, Obi-Wan is killed). Together, Eragon and Arya go to the Varden, but are followed there by the King's men. They must then prepare for The Final Battle (Together, Luke and Leia go to the Rebels, but are followed there by the Empire. They must then prepare for The Final Battle). The Final Battle takes place, many are killed, but Durza is killed and the battle is won - for now (The Final Battle takes place, many are killed, but Grand Moff Tarkin {another of the Emperor's Important Henchman} is killed and the battle is won - for now).

It had what I believe to be a quick and detailed pace. There was a perfect amount of back story and details to where you knew what you needed to. There was never a boring moment or 20 minute detailed ramblings of names and places that leave you feeling like sleep is a better alternative.

But then again, so was LOTR and star wars.Back to point, movie. The movie is fun to watch, it has some teeth clenching moments in which you think to yourself ""No they didn't."" The story has some holes in it, mostly coming from pacing.When you see the movie and you notice a hole, you know it comes from the pacing of the book. You can't put everything in the movie. Only difference is, you could have tried to fill it up. Asides from these points, it's a fun movie with a nice ending. It has some ""Way to go kid!"" moments and some ""Nice moves"" moments.

479,nick-imdb-3,May appeal to pre-teens but contains some realistic violence,5,7 January 2007,"Eragon the movie is adapted from Christopher Paolini's book of the same name; the first book of the Inheritance Trilogy. Paolini started writing Eragon at age 15; the book was initially published by his parents' publishing company and later republished and became a New York Times Bestseller.The fantasy genre gives authors a great deal of license to invent strange worlds - strange races, magical powers, complicated backgrounds and so on. This movie is set in a rather pedestrian fantasy world; there is little in the background to challenge the adult viewer. Fortunately though the movie provides reasonably good imagery. The special effects are realistic and not overdone.Supporting actor Jeremy Irons provides a solid performance as Brom, providing dignity and humanity to the mentor role.John Malkovitch, for all his talent and experience, was merely a caricature in this movie. He deserved much more screen time and depth of character than he received.The movie's dialogue is mostly functional, with the occasional quotable gem. Jeremy Irons has most of the good lines.Due to the rather simplistic plot, I think this movie works best for children aged around 8-12. The violence and generally detailed portrayal of the evil monsters may scare the younger children. The love story subplot is almost nonexistent, so you won't need to explain away any sexual behaviour.Comparisons will be made with Lord Of The Rings - adults may derive some secret pleasure by nominating each character's LotR alter-ego. This is not difficult. Ultimately Eragon is a shallow movie, coming perhaps too soon while the epic LotR remains fresh in our memories.

I am actually shocked to see how many people are giving it bad reviews. Sure, I haven't read the book like a lot of people have, but if you take the movie for itself, it is passingly well-done. Just don't go in expecting a LOTR and you should find the movie very enjoyable. The special effects are for the most part superb, including the dragon, Saphira, who looked a lot more realistic than I expected. Ed Speelers does a very commendable job, for his debut movie performance. He comes across as a fresh-faced, somewhat naive, but sincere and believable Eragon.I don't know about the book, but this isn't a movie with a deep storyline, or important moral. It's a fun, fantasy film with plenty of thrills, a few funny or touching moments and stunning cinematography. But, that being said, it didn't feel empty. I left the theater feeling very satisfied and more than ready to see a sequel. I really hate to see people giving it such a bad rap. It gets 9 out of 10 stars from me. The one star off being for some clumsiness in the plotting/script and some of the disturbingly ugly evil creatures (I don't recall the name), which I think could have been downplayed more for a PG movie.Overall, Eragon is a highly enjoyable experience. I hope more people start to see it as such.",Eragon
482,da_zeon,Good as an independent film but bad as an adaptation,5,23 December 2006,"When I read ""Eragon"", I was totally amazed. It was such a great book. Months later I discovered that a movie would come out in the late 2006. That was happy news for me because ""Eragon"" had become a masterpiece for me - actually it's my favorite book. I went to the cinema today and saw the movie and I come to the same conclusion that I came to after watching ""Harry Potter"", ""The Lord of the Rings"" and ""The Chronicles of Narnia"" - they are good as independent films but cannot reach the level of greatness of the books. Certainly, the fact that 500 pages are made into a 100 minutes film is made only because of the budget or because they tried to make it more childish. There are some really violent and bloody scenes in the novel that don't exist in the movie. It's the only weakness of the film - won't get to the expectations of the readers. Besides that, the visual effects are excellent, Peter Goyle, as we know, is a great music composer, the actors are very good and people who haven't read the book will enjoy it.",Eragon
483,rachandben,"Not a bad movie, but a poor adaptation",8,25 December 2006,"If you like adventure movies, this is a good one. I think it is compelling how Eragon goes from being a regular young man and is transformed into a dragon rider who battles evil not just for himself but for the rest of his country. I like quest movies and fantasy movies and I also liked this movie. His relationship with Brom and with his dragon Saphira is the heart of the story. If you are a big fan of the book Eragon, then this movie may bother you because of the changes that they make. I understand that because I remember feeling that way about the Harry Potter movies. At first, I can only focus on what was left out but then realize why they did what they did and get past it. There are a lot of things that are different from the book and it is not just omissions. How the farm gets destroyed is totally different (although I suspect they wanted to try to get away from the Star Wars similarity of Luke coming home to find Uncle Owen and Aunt Veru etc) I am not sure if they are going to make Eldest but if they do they will have to do some backpedaling because they show flirting with Eragon and Arya which did not happen in the book. It made it seem like they were both interested in each other but we know that cannot be (from Arya's side). They left out the twins so I am not sure how the beginning of Eldest will unfold. I thought the acting was good. Brom, Eragon, Durza, (and Saphira) were great. (not crazy about John Malkovich as Gallbatorix--but again, in the book we never hear conversations between Gallbatorix and Durza so who knows what he was like). Visually, the movie it is very appealing to watch. The score was a little overpowering to me. If you haven't read the book, SEE THIS MOVIE. Then go read the book. Seeing the movie made me want to reread the book, and I am. If you are a fan of the book, just be aware that there are changes but apparently Christopher Paolini was in on those changes so they must not have bothered him too much. People are attacking this movie as a book adaptation, not on the merits of the movie alone.",Eragon
484,thriftymoviecritic,"A carbonite copy of 'Star Wars"" or ""Lord of the Rings"" than the novel that ""Eragon"" was based on.",2,26 May 2014,"Eragon is a carbonite copy of Star Wars and Peter Jackson's Lord of the Rings rather than the book that the film is based on. There are so many little nuances like Eragon (Ed Speelers) grieving for his uncle is a shot for shot rip off from Episode IV: A New Hope where Luke (Mark Hamill) mourns his relatives. The cinematography is attempting to make the world of Alagasia as grandeur as Middle Earth, but is trite in comparison.Eragon has some of the worst pacing for a fantasy film that I have ever seen. The novel is 500 pages long while the run time is just over the 90 minute mark. The movie is practically a series of introductions and as soon as a character exits off screen we may never see or hear from them no matter how significant a role they play in the novel. There is little entertaining or even worthwhile to watch in the 100 minute rushed film. If it was 30 minutes longer at least I think there was potential for an okay movie. The only parts that I got a kick out of was Jeremy Irons who played Eragon's trainer named Bron and Durza (Robert Carlyle) who was Galbatorix's (John Malkovich) Sorcerer. Both of these actors were at least trying to breathe life into this dreadful film and they were the only actors that made this sit bearable.I felt that Eragon is a failure of a movie that is too short and had more in common with Star Wars and LOTR than the novel that it was originally based on. It has a few enjoyable moments such as Jeremy Irons and Robert Carlyle. I would recommend watching LOTR or even Star Wars over this film because it made me think about those films over the one that I was watching. Let's let Eragon join the countless other fantasy films that have become lost and forgotten.For the full review go to: http://www.thriftymoviecritic.com/reviews-1- 5.html",Eragon
485,Its_Not_A_Tumaaa,I wonder if the screenwriters bothered even reading the book...,1,2 April 2007,"I had decent hopes for this movie. Not necessarily ""high"" hopes, but I believed the movie would be at least somewhat decent and follow the book. Boy, was I ever wrong.Watching the movie, I thought it was a medevial rendition of ""Star Wars."" It followed Star Wars exactly to a T. Basically, this is Eragon: An inexperienced farm boy (Luke Skywalker) receives a strange blue stone. The stone is actually a dragon. This dragon leads him to a wise old sage, Brom, (Obi-Wan Kenobi) who helps him to explain the history of the Dragon Riders. (Jedi) Eragon learns he is now the last of the Dragon Riders, and first of the new generation. (Hmm, sound familiar?) The Dragon Riders were betrayed by King Galbatorix (Darth Sidious) and murdered, thus leaving him sole Emperor. King Galbatorix comissions his apprentice, Durza (Darth Vader) to track down and kill Eragon. Eragon's Uncle is killed, much like Uncle Owen. Now Eragon and Brom set off on a journey to reach the Varden. (The Rebel Alliance.) Along the way, Eragon manages to save Elven Princess Arya (Princess Leia) from the Imperial Prison, where she is held and tortured by Dar... I mean, Durza. Eragon is aided by a mysterious wanderer Murtaugh. (Han Solo) and then must help the Rebel Alliance.. Err, VARDEN, to ward off the approaching forces of The Empire.Sound familiar? I sure hope it does. While the book uses the same plot line, it differentiates itself in several key plot points and characters. For one, Saphira did NOT grow up in a day. Eragon cares for her discretely from her Uncle and Roran. Eragon flies with Saphira and burns his legs, then begins on a journey back to the farm. Eragon's uncle dies after three days of care... Although the biggest difference is the plot, which really helps with character. Eragon and Brom's initial quest was vengeance against the Raz'zac. This leads to additional characters and subplots.As a movie, the pacing is so quick the viewer is never fully emerged in the story. There is no development in character, as the movie only seems to care about action sequences.Bad movie.",Eragon
486,remitomsa,Still makes money,6,27 January 2020,Yes the movie could be better but it's funny how this kind of thing makes money anyway. It means people are not experts at cinema and just they want entertainment . That's all.,Eragon
487,BigDaddyConway,Eragon is a rousing tale reminiscent of Peter Jackson's Lord of the Rings series.,7,16 December 2006,"Eragon is tale of, a farm boy who is chosen by a dragon's egg -- a discovery that leads him on a predestined journey where he realized he's the one person who can defend his homeland of Alagaesia against an evil king.Eragon is reminiscent of Peter Jackson's Lord of the Rings series and based off a novel by Christopher Paolini. It has characters with the British imagined names and tale of dragons, orcs, magic, dark sorcerers and kings. Filmed in Hungary it has scenes with the most striking landscapes that you forget to watch the movie.Fairly well acted with a cast that features Jeremy Irons as Brom, Eragon mentor, John Malkovich as King Galbatorix, Sienna Guillory, from Resident Evil: Apocalypse, as Arya, Djimon Hounsou as Ajhad, and newcomer, Edward Speleers as Eragon.It's an entertaining movie for with amazing special effects. The dragon, Saphira, voiced amazingly by Rachel Weisz, is a stunning work of computer animation. If by design or not Saphira overshadows the picture with is majestic poses and movement. The effects makes you want to ride her with her power and grace; ""Only a rider may command its dragon"".Just as the movie starts to pick up it ends. Eragon leaves you with a WTF feeling. There are definitely sequels coming. If you have never read the book it does make you want to see more. Having at this point never read the books I was entertained. As is with most movies based on books I maybe disappointed with this movie.",Eragon
488,Stubi-Wun-Kanubi,A child fantasy that tries to be an grand epic for adults.,4,20 December 2006,"Just like Eragon the character is criticized in various scenes, Eragon the movie could have been so... so... so much more.It's a real disappointment that the film fell way short of the mark to be the fantasy epic that it could have been. I don't think anybody could ever topple Peter Jackson's Lord of the Rings trilogy, let alone come close, but it appears that Eragon doesn't even try to. Take away some of the battle scenes and Saphira's wonderful CGI eye-candy, and you have something that even a young child would criticize, and rightly so.With such a great cast of European actors involved (Jeremy Irons, Robert Carlyle to name a few), I wonder how they could have accepted such a dreadful screenplay when accepting their roles for this film.. Peter Buchman wrote the screenplay for Jurassic Park III, and in a way Eragon's cheesy one-liners seem to wholly reflect this.Perhaps the most memorable scenes were of course the flight (and fight) scenes with Eragon and Saphira. The drawback was that I had to endure the parts in between, which seemed to be a whole load of good talent going to waste.It's a good film to take the kids along to, as they'll probably adore Saphira. Just don't expect to enjoy the ride as they do.",Eragon
489,trond-gjeset,Bad movie,2,17 December 2006,"First of all let me tell you this. I did read the book and i knew that i would be a bit disappointed of the movie as they rarely measure up to the book they sometimes are made from. Second of all i gotta say that i was TERRIBLY disappointed by this movie, i found myself pondering if mr. Stefen Fangmeier even read it before deciding to direct a movie from it. The timeline was all messed up and i saw characters who never even met in the book meet each other in the film not to mention doing things that are CLEARLY stated IMPOSSIBLE in the book. And how are we supposed to see the difference between races when Humans and Elves look so similar, everyone know elves have pointy ears! The only bright spots i saw in this film was actually good effects (although locations wheren't as good as they could have been such as Farthern Dur), Character selections (which i would have used should i have made it myself) and the most charming little baby dragon that i fell in love with despite the few minutes we actually got to see her.This movie could have been a lot better as it is and to top of that i'm disappointed that they didn't make it longer giving room for more time to get to know the characters. I didn't get to see ANYTHING of Eragon that i recognized from the book and i don't blame the actor, i blame the SCRIPT!",Eragon
490,ironshadowknot,Totally Amazing,10,17 February 2008,"I only just watched this movie and i thought it was brilliant i would have liked to have seen John Malkovich in it a bit more but all in all it was great. The Special Effects we beautifully done the story was straight to the point and didn't drag on but sometimes very predictable i don't know why people think the acting was hopeless the acting was brilliant especially Robert Carlyle who played Durza The Shade, i thought his portrayal was really good played a very evil man, Ed Speelers i thought was good for a first major picture playing along side Jeremy Irons, John Malkovich, Robert Carlyle, Rachel Weiz, and Djimon Hounsou would be very nerve racking especially trying to act to their standards, i was even quite surprised to see Australian Actor Chris Egan who played Roran even though he wasn't in it for long it was still good to see him in a movie rather than in Home and Away, Jeremy Irons and John Malkovich two of my favourite actors i thought were good to.So all in all i thought it was good don't know why people don't like this movie so much i just think people should rather just enjoy a movie instead or picking at everything just so they can have an argument, i recommend it to anyone and hopefully there will be a sequel.",Eragon
491,adggreene,Another hero discovers his destiny,7,18 December 2006,"We've heard these stories before, we've read them, we've seen them, we've played them: the stories where a lone hero goes from being your everyday country boy to the hero of legend. Boy meets mentor, boy meets girl, boy turns into a warrior, boy kicks bad guy ass. Sound familiar?Eragon doesn't come with anything really new. I guess its not the most innovative thing, to take a cliché fantasy story and turn it into a movie. A friend of mine who saw it with me stated that the first half was mostly the same as that of Star Wars episode 4. I agree, there are similarities. But there are differences also. The concept of the dragon, for one. And the spells look a few dozen years more advanced that the Force did back in the days.I haven't read the book, which was probably a good thing. It's possible that having read the book would have ruined what was a well spent afternoon, in the company of a dragon-rider looking to find his way.There is little to say about the visual effects, they fit the story and with the exception of a slightly cartoonish baby dragon, weren't troublesome in any way. The casting, I think, is great. The acting, I guess, is true to the script, which, in turn, could be re-used lines from the past century's hero stories. The lines serve their purpose.Overall, it's your everyday fantasy story, your everyday fantasy adaptation movie, and your everyday adventure. It's not going to be the best of the century, or even the best of the month, but it was an experience well worth the time and money spent.I want a dragon too.",Eragon
492,big_cjc,"Not read the book, Like fantasy, then you will like this.",8,17 April 2007,"First of all I will point out that I have not read the book.From a non reader of the book point of view, all these deleted scenes and story lines that have been cut out/left out of the film, made no difference to me. I also urge those of you who have not read the book, to disregard those whose comments put the film down, due to it not being quite like the book.This is simply a Good fantasy movie, the acting was above average, although I do agree Edward Speleers seemed a little out of place throughout, the rest of the acting I thought was very good, and Rachel Weisz voicing the dragon was a great choice, and i actually liked what was left with the storyline, it may not have been as good as the book, biut I enjoyed it all the same.Now i am not saying those who have read the book are wrong, but just pointing out that if you have not read the book, then some of their put downs are meaningless, and if you like fantasy films, then you will like this. Who knows, now Im going to read the book, I will probably agree with their comments, but still compared to some fantasy movies this is still one of the better ones, and I am hoping they will make a sequel.

493,dale_jr_fan,Horigon (as in Horrible Eragon),1,18 December 2006,"What happened to this movie? I loved the book, but this movie stinks. It is not true to the book, leaves too much out, and the rest is unimaginative. The bad guys--Urgals and Razac--are about as believable as kids playing Cowboys and Indians. I had my doubts about Ed Speleers being cast as Eragon from the beginning. He just did not click with me, turns out I was right. The trip Eragon, Sapphira, Brom and Arya made to the Varden and the Dwarf city seemed to take about two or three days, as opposed to weeks in the book. Sapphira's near instantaneous maturation is a crock of s*it, Uncle Garrow's house was destroyed by the Razac in the book, not by Brom. Angela was much older in the book. Zaroc, if I remember correctly, had a red jewel in the hilt,(not blue) to match the color of the rider's dragon which Zaroc belonged to (Morzan). No werecat in the movie. In the movie, Murtagh shows up out of nowhere during Arya's rescue--this is not in the book. Where were the twins?? The twins are key characters to the turn of events in the Eldest. My gosh, I could go on half the night about what is wrong with this movie, but I make my point. Jeremy Irons and John Malkovich seemed to have tried their best to sustain this movie, but with the screen play being the utterly horrid and unimaginative adaptation of the book that it is, they just couldn't get the job done. THE ONLY things about this movie that I even remotely enjoyed were Rachel Weisz's voice over of Sapphira, the CGI for Sapphira, and the scenery. The scenery was stunning. I am really, really, really disappointed with this movie for two reasons. I enjoyed the book so much I looked forward to adding the movie to my DVD collection, but it ain't gonna happen. This movie will likely be such a dud that there will be no Eldest sequel. That there will likely be no sequel is hard to think about, because Eldest in many ways is better than Eragon because of clearer character development and plot twists that will surprise you right up 'till the end of the book. I guess the best that fans of Eragon can hope for is that that it will be remade into its blockbuster potential. I guess all the haters of the book out there finally have something to gloat about, unfortunately.",Eragon
494,sexyblue-eyes,What the heck happened???,6,20 December 2006,"I love the book Eragon, but the movie wasn't very good. After my friends and I saw the movie, we pointed out everything they missed and things they changed...we could have went all night! One thing, I though Arya was an elf...why didn't she look it? Why did the dwarf king look human? In the book, the shade didn't kill Brom, it was the Ra'zac. Why didn't they show The Twins? What about the baby he put a spell on? There are so many things they should have put in. My boyfriend said ""well they couldn't put it all in, not everyone likes specifics"". Well they could have used 3hrs instead of 1hr45min. Some of the lines were cheesy ""You look...like your ready for battle""??? And the fact that everything seemed to happen over a couple days? Also, in the book, the King never made an appearance. He was only talked about.The only thing I liked was the Dragon. Looked like the one on the book cover. Well I better stop, like I said, there are SOOO many things that they missed! At least the Harry Potter movies were a likeness to the books (well, except Prisoner of Azkaban). Watch Eragon for your self and decide!",Eragon

But unfortunately, his performance is really disappointing. On the other hand, Jeremy Irons, another great actor, did a great role. I have not read the book, but I've been told that a lot of the main plot is not in the movie. Did the movie makers try to keep the movie short to go against other popular fantasy movies (The Lord of the Rings, Harry Potter, etc)? There were scenes that did not make any sense and did not provide useful information. This is a movie that one would watch on a Sunday evening when there is nothing else to do.",Eragon
497,cryptkeeper3000,"This movie is to the book what the animated ""LotR"" is to Tolkein's work",3,17 December 2006,"Where, oh where, shall I begin? WARNING. THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS OF BOTH BOOK AND MOVIE.1. Many major plot elements are altered or excised entirely. In the book, Eragon's cousin Roran leaves the farm to work so he can save up money to get married. In the movie, he's basically dodging the draft, leaving before the Empire's soldiers come to press him into service.Additionally, Carvahall is shown as a miserable little dung heap of a town, under constant harassment from the Empire, rather than the poor, but peaceful village from the novel.2. Characterization changes that add nothing to the story. In the book, Brom is a somewhat eccentric, but well-liked village storyteller; the movie portrays him as little more than a drunk with too much time on his hands.Sloan the butcher is almost friendly with Eragon, and the subplot of Roran and Sloan's daughter is entirely removed, making it almost impossible to include Roran in the movie versions of ""Eldest"" or the third novel.The Ra'Zac, rather than being the king's vicious and deadly bounty hunters, are little more than bogeymen called up from the ether; despite Brom's comment that Eragon would be lucky to last a minute against them, Eragon dispatches one of them easily with a simple spell. Additionally, rather than the menacing, Ringwraith-like figures from the book, they look more like mummified ninjas with maggots crawling through their skin.Rather than leaving his home to hunt the Ra'Zac and avenge his uncle's murder, Eragon goes with Brom because of the old man's insistence that they FLEE the Ra'Zac.Arya is changed into a human, or at least a very human-like elf, for no particular reason. The dwarfs in the movie suffer from the same indistinguishability.Angela, a fairly major character, is reduced to a single appearance, and many other characters with major storyline impacts are cut out completely.In the book, Murtagh is understandably reluctant to go anywhere near the Varden because of his lineage. In the movie, he shows no hesitance in leading Eragon straight to them, despite that his demeanor around their leader shows that he knew he'd be met with suspicion. Additionally, he is shown as a flighty, feckless wanderer, rather than a self-torturing fugitive from the Empire.Galbatorix, rather than being an insane, but cunning ruler, is Lex Luthor-like in his deliberate and unapologetic evil.3. Rushed timeline. The entire movie feels like it could take place within the space of a month, from beginning to end. Rather than having Saphira grow naturally, she is shown as reaching maturity in a series of thunderclaps on her first flight. Brom and Eragon seem to cross Alaegesia in a matter of days or weeks, with very little shown of what they actually do on the trip.4. Altered story elements. The ancient language, which is the bedrock of all reality in the book and was spoken by the first intelligent beings in the book's world, is changed to ""the ancient language of the elves"".Event timelines are rearranged in ways that do nothing to help the story; the only such change that makes any sense is Eragon working out that Brom was once a Rider.The movie removes all moral shades of gray that the book has, turning the story into little more than a fairy tale of good versus evil.In conclusion...take my advice. Read the books, skip the movies. It's free to get them from a library, and even if you end up not liking them, at least you'll be able to truthfully claim to have given them a chance, which will put you a step above the fanatics who rant about the evil of Harry Potter while proudly trumpeting the fact that they've never read them.",Eragon
498,sdtsanev,I don't like the book but I expected a nice movie made from it...,3,4 January 2007,"...alas, this is not the case. OK, so Eragon IS ripped off Star Wars, but so what? A New Hope was a nice movie, wasn't it? Better to steal from it, than from Zoolander. But to make it into a ""play in the straw with the cousin"" movie with actually NO memorable special effects (hell-o? we're talking' FANTASY here?), ridiculous lines and script to actually feel pity for? Well, not nice at all. The movie suffers from lack of budget (or may be too big part of it went for bribing John Malkovitch to actually appear in it), and from a distinct lack of elves and dwarfs. Such as - I might add - ARE present in the book. For crying out loud, the PRINCESS is supposed to be an ELF, not a human! Not only is Eragon poor in every aspect, but the scriptwriters have also severed all connections from the book, that could lead them to the sequel. For which - I strongly hope - ANOTHER director will be chosen. Because I don't think I'm gonna watch a second movie like this one.Oh, and Edward Speleers is actually OK and not totally gay. Who'd have thought...",Eragon
499,ba-nancy,Coles notes,2,27 December 2006,"I have read the book and was looking forward to the movie. Unfortunately, it was a large disappointment. Basically, the main plot of getting a dragon and going to fight against Galbatorix was the thread and anything that deviated from that was dropped or squished in to fit. The whole love interest portion was missing and my favourite character...the werecat... was nowhere to be seen! Not to mention the crystal rose (blood rose if I recall correctly) wasn't in the final fight. The king and his daughter appeared to have two different accents. Even that, with American, British, and other accents all existing from people who were from the same area was shortsighted.I spoke to a friend who saw the movie without having read the book and he didn't even realize there was an elf and dwarfs in the movie. It was too much a flash and not enough story.Eragon's magical skills were conveniently self-discovered instead of painfully taught. Scenery and locations were all a blur as they travelled so quickly from one place to the next.The only thing the movie was good for is to get a visual on characters to help envision the adventure when reading the book.The movie could have been made to take up 3 hours easy with a lot of depth and character but instead it was cut very short.Can't say I'm looking forward to the next one.",Eragon

The only good things about this movie were the dragon, the incredibly good looking ""I'm the bad guy's son but I am good"" guy, and the movie was short.I must have been expecting Lord of the Rings. That is definitely not what I got.This movie was so anticlimactic. It almost got interesting at some points but then something didn't happen and brought it right back down. I went to see this with my friend and we laughed pretty hard at how bad the script and story were when we got out of the theater. Now I am being forced to this god-awful movie again. Maybe i will just throw myself off of the balcony.And when will people stop putting John Malkovich in movies?",Eragon
501,actorguy213,Wonderful Book...Okay Movie,5,15 December 2006,"This film of Eragon could be subtitled ""Attack of the Lousy Screenplay."" Christopher Paolini has got to be really steamed at what's happened to the marvelous first book of the Inheritance Trilogy. For those of you who haven't read it, the novel is full of mystery and intrigue with most of the characters holding little secrets that add up to several ""ah-ha!"" moments when reading the book. However, instead of ""ah-ha,"" this screenplay gives us lots of ""HAY! Hey you! Did you notice this?!"" Nearly every bit of mystery and revelation has been pounded out of the story. You know you're in trouble in the first 10 seconds of the film as a rather clumsy prologue gives away information that shouldn't be revealed until one-forth of the way through the film. In essence, everything that Paolini is good at is missing from the movie.However the movie isn't a total loss. Ed Speelers is quite good in the title role. He's quite solid and, considering this is his first acting work, will likely grow into a really fine performer for the upcoming movies in the trilogy. And, of course, there is Jeremy Irons, who is easily the best casting in the film. He gives a terrific, albeit far too brief, performance as Brom. Opposite the two is Robert Carlyle as the Shade Durza. Carlyle is just plain creepy and brings a really nice balance to his foes. There are a few other strong performances in smaller roles, but mostly the cast comes across as rather bland, more likely a reflection on Stefen Fangmeier's direction than their abilities.Fangmeier races through the story, groping for the next battle. Battles are great and all, especially when they're led by a big blue dragon, but they aren't as effective if you don't know what the characters are fighting for. The sense of ""home"" is stripped away from the book. All of Paolini's great descriptions of Eragon's relationship with the townsfolk of Carvahall are gone. In fact, there are virtually no cities in this film...odd since there are at least four rather important cities in the book. Obviously you can't keep everything from the novel, but a lot of very important (and helpful) material was simply ejected. If the film was pushing 3 hours, I could understand, but Eragon barely breaks 1 1/2 hours. I never thought I'd say this about an epic not directed by Peter Jackson, but the movie could have used about 35 more minutes of good material. They've proved that faster is not always better.The good news is that Fangmeier's background is in Visual Effects. As a result, Saphira is spectacular! She HAD to work for this movie to happen, and she does. See this movie in the theater for her alone! Overall, not a bad trip to the movies, but considering the quality of the novel, it's a bit disappointing. Go see it anyway, just send notes to Fox asking them to find a better screenwriter for the sequel.",Eragon
502,divydademon,Where is Peter Jackson when you need him.,1,6 January 2007,"This movie was ridiculously lousy. I don't know why but it seems like Chris Paolini doesn't even respect his own work enough to make the movie an accurate representation. Meetings were wrong, characters missing, and WHERE THE HELL IS SOLEMBUM...no werecat anywhere in the movie...and angela who is a major character is cut to a 2 minute scene that made no sense...no Jeod and Brom died the wrong way in the wrong place. I like the changes made to Saphira from membrane wings to featherish. That is my only compliment...how can an epic book be made into only and hour and a half. This should have been done correctly as a 3 to 4 hour movie like lord of the rings. Even Arya's part is so different that the sequel has been set up for absolute disaster. It needs to be shut down and redone because there's not even enough wiggle room for a decent extended DVD because the scenes are so twisted...horrible movie that i wasted good money on thinking maybe it would be good especially since the author is actually alive. He should be appalled at his lack of respect for his own work...good art cant be made w/ money on the mind and it seems that this immature 22 year old was in it for the money and not a good portrayal of art....whoever wrote the screen adaptation should be shot and banned from the industry forever.",Eragon
503,Muggen85,What does everyone have against this move?!!,10,30 December 2006,"I don't know why so many didn't enjoy this movie. This movie has all that a fantasy tale must have to bee a good one. Dragons, evil king, battle between good and evil. And the special effects is just brilliant.Jeremy Irons is great as Brom, John Malkovich as king Galbatrox and Robert Carlyne is brilliant for the role as Durza. The new actor Edward Speleers is good as Eragon and Rachel Weiz does to voice to Saphira brilliant.This movie is also brilliant filmed. Good pictures over New Zeealand and the special effects is so well done as you sometimes thinks: how the *** did they do that.Eragon is very good movie and the best fantasy movie I have seen after The Lord of The Rings trilogy.SEE IT!! DON'T CARE WHAT EVERYONE SAY!!! SEE IT!!!!!!",Eragon
504,slashs-54076,A movie loosely based on Sparknotes,1,12 May 2021,"This movie was terrible. But in its defense I think trying to cram one book into a movie was a poor idea from the start. There's zero character development and important parts of the timeline were ignored completely. Not to mention basic anatomy of characters. Urgals and Razac looked nothing as described in the books. From what I read this movie was posed to be the first of four but I don't even know how that's possible considering Roran is barely mentioned, Sloan appears for 45 seconds and Katrina isn't even mentioned. As I titled this review I feel the writer and director didn't even read the books just read some spark notes and winged it. Such a shame. Hopefully with Disney behind it they can remake this into a Disney + Series and redeem this trash.",Eragon
505,yavennie,Eragon: Why finding the Fountain of Youth is Bad.,2,16 December 2006,"First, let me set the scene. A group of fantasy and sci-fi loving individuals, myself included, walking into the theatre to experience a children's bestseller on screen.And afterwards, I walked out of theatre, wondering: how that book make the bestseller list, and for weeks at a time? My only guess is that the main audience was young children and new to the genre of fantasy, looking for a fix that seemingly was appropriate to their age. A child cannot exactly pick up, say, Game of Thrones, and enjoy it. Way too much racy content.The movie itself was awful, and in any case, the entire mess started with Chrisopher Paolini. The poor fool. Humiliated by his book in front of readers, and now, in front of movie critics. The world knows now that he was nothing more than a boy of fifteen. Right? He was fifteen when he wrote it. Eternally, Paolini found the Fountain of Youth, and now, is encased forever as a fifteen-year old genius who produced an excellent fantasy novel(s).Well, rotten excuse. Apparently I was not the only one avidly watching The Lord of the Rings Trilogy. Obviously, it was as important to another fellow. And it shows up blatantly in his appalling film. Yes, I understand it is wrong to blame him entirely for the disaster of the movie, but quite frankly, the boy started the mess. Personally, that is an outright sign of decadence, ripping content from literary classics. But remember, he is a fifteen-year old genius. Encased in his golden book.To understand why this film was so bad, first one must realize that the book was written by a kid. It was bound to be a failure from the start. Simply, he did not have enough experience. It seems as though he took his first attempt at writing a fantasy novel, and threw it at editors (who, mind you, knew him and his parents...), and then tried to clean the book up as best they could before unleashing it to the world. And it shows glaringly. The script and acting are as stinky and foul as sour milk. To be honest, the only reason I gave the film two stars was because I laughed so hard through it. Yes, you heard me. I laughed. And harder than I have for any other fantasy movie which proved to have a lack of seriousness involved because of the cringe-worthy script. Dragonheart, or many of Sci-Fi channel's original movies, such as a take on famed Ursula Le Guin's books. Eragon was far worse.So as to leave a final message concerning this film. If you are a fan of Lord of the Rings and/or Star Wars, then kindly leave this film. Trust me, it is not for you. Watching it will only make you want to write angry letters to the author. And for less sophisticated individuals, punch him.",Eragon
506,TheGreyGuardian,should have said inspired not based,3,14 January 2007,"When a movie is based on a book i always read the book before i see the movie. I wan impressed by Eragon but not totally thrilled. Then the movie came out and i decided to go see it with a friend despite of the bad criticisms i had heard. Eventually the film was worse than i expected and if hadn't read the book i wouldn't have been able to follow the story. The director kept jumping from an event to another without linking them together. He also mixed parts of the story and made the film confusing and difficult to follow. Although i knew the story i could never say what was going to happen next. Not to mention that most of the story's events were completely changed. Therefore, in my opinion at the credits is should have said inspired of not based upon. The acting and the music background could and should have been better. The making of such a film should have been offered to a more experienced cast and crew. The only thing that was worth seeing in this movie was the dragon which was a great attempt but still not perfect.",Eragon
507,Ihni,Pretty okay,6,16 December 2006,"I will rate this as a 6 out of 10, all in all. After reading the book, and finding in it lots of elements that I love reading about, I had high expectations. At some points, I was not disappointed. The effects are as good as one can expect, and I didn't have to stop and think ""Oh well that doesn't look real at all!"" once, as I often must do when I'm watching other movies. So a 9 for the special effects.About the characters, I can't complain either. All the actors were convincing enough (even Mr New Guy, who did a better job than I thought he would); I just wish that there had been more time to get to know the characters. I know, I know, in books, there's all the time in the world, but that doesn't work in movies. Too bad. So, characters get a 7 out of 10.Pictures and scenes; Loved the nature and the places, that looked good enough. Some images were REALLY beautiful and took my breath away. There were a few times in close-ups of people that annoyed me because ... well, I don't know the English words for it, so I'll leave it at that. Never mind. For the Looks, a 6. Plot, well, followed the book ... kinda. Kinda sorta. Even though it was an eternity since I read the book, I missed a lot of things (again, I KNOW that they can't put it all in the movie - but I WISH). And actually, that was the only real problem I had with the movie. Too ... short. I wish they had put an extra 20 minutes in it, so that we'd get more time with the characters and what ultimately binds them together, and also to make the jump between scenes a little less ... painful. The sometimes too rough jump between different scenes gets a 4.All in all, a 6, as mentioned. And I might also add that it's a good movie. I enjoyed it, and Respect to everyone who's worked on it.Also, I'm totally in love with Saphira.",Eragon
508,cgrabar90,Horrible! Dreadful would be and understatement!,1,15 December 2006,"Now we first witnessed Paolini's genius in the book Eragon, and then Eldest, and his third book is still to come, but it will surely be a masterpiece. Now what the director of this movie was thinking when he started this movie is beyond me. Paolini's masterpiece was defiled and put to shame, there was barely any smalarities, the only thing really was the names! It was a disgrace, it barely followed the book. I would have to say that the best part would be when Ed Speelers (whose acting was amazing, the script just sucked!) has his shirt off, and when Saphira was a baby dragon (she was so cute and well portrayed). But both those scenes lated all of two seconds! This movie literally made me want to gouge my eyeballs out with the straw off my pop!The romance plot is totally messed up, the battle scenes were pathetic for the technology we have in this day and age, and the ending does not convince the audience that the sequel(eldest) will be coming out, which would be a gift to humanity because if the first was terrible then you can only imagine how they would ruin the brilliance of the second one and possibly when the third, if and when it comes out. This movie was a pure waste of actors/actresses' talent as well as the author's talent--as well as oxygen and well in general, LIFE!!! Read the book!!! I mean if i was one of those kids who didn't like to read, this movie (ugg how could they call it a movie!) would inspire me to read the book. UGGGG it was a disgrace!!",Eragon
509,Niles200,Ow... This movie is not good in any way.,3,14 December 2006,"I've read the book and am able to divorce myself from the two different forms of media. While I feel the book is fairly lackluster in writing the plot is interesting enough. The film doesn't really even have that going for it. As bad an idea as it is in the Oregon Trail, setting the pace to grueling is poor here as well. The pacing seems rushed and never gives the viewer a chance to connect and care about any of the characters. So when certain characters die or change or whatever there is no emotional impact. Being a first time director, Stefen Fangmeier does not yet know how to be an effective storyteller. Probably also due to Fangmeier's inexperience the performances seem set on autopilot. If word of mouth has any effect, after opening day this movie seems poised for deserved failure. A shame that this trilogy just can't get off the ground.",Eragon
510,Weine,The dialogue spoils it all,6,15 December 2006,"The visuals were spectacular, the soundtrack didn't stand out (so it must've done it's job), the sceneries were great, and the story didn't feel all that contrived. Oh, and fantasy is one of my favourite genres. So why only a 6?Could it be the casting? Not really, most actors (both the known ones, such as John Malkovich, and the lesser known ones) were doing an acceptable job with the material at hand. No, the big problem was the dialogue. Most of the time the dialogue feels like something an average 8 year old could've managed to outperform. Some lines where cliché, some lines badly timed, but most of it was just plain crap.It's a real pity too, because a movie this beautiful simply shouldn't have to suffer from something as annoying as bad dialogue. And even if the sequels would improve on this (something I dearly hope -- shouldn't be too hard either), it'll still leave the first movie as a landmark of how to ruin an otherwise nice experience.Oh, and Galbatorix might possibly be one of the lamest villain-names ever. But that's Inheritance (pun intended) from the book, so I'll forgive them for that; changing major things like that is something that only happens in... hmmm... Earthsea *shudder*",Eragon
511,fisherd,A poor product from a rookie director,2,21 December 2006,"Formula for disaster ..... take a rookie director whose reputation is as a CGI/FX whiz kid, an unknown screen writer, a cast that looks fantastic on paper, but embodies nothing of the original characters and has to deliver the schlock that before mentioned screenwriter has written, and then attempt to set to film once of the most anticipated book adaptations in recent history. It fails on so many levels.I DID read the book, but have the sense to know that film doesn't have to completely follow the book word-for-word/chapter-for-chapter. I am not one of the fanatics raving that the movie sucks because Arya is blonde or doesn't have ""elf ears"". I am saying the movie sucks for all the reasons already mentioned ad nauseum .... because the pacing is deplorable, the dialog is beyond bad, and the directing is cliché. I thought that the effects were actually quite good -- Duza's makeup, aside. One questionable costume design was Arya's ""Indian Princess"" costume in the last scene. She looks like an extra from some 40's western.To sum, the director and screen writer should be tarred and feathered, but only after the studio execs who green-lighted this turd are drawn and quartered. Too many fans had too many expectations for something FAR better than this.",Eragon
512,richard_andmel,Really enjoyed it but it could have been so much more,9,13 January 2007,"I just have one question for all of the reviewers that thought Rachel Weisz was the best part of this film... What movie were you all watching? Next to John Malkovitch phoning it in she was the only other person I would have definitely replaced. She's a great actress, but she needs to give voice overs a miss if Eragon is representative of her work. The main thing that lets this movie down compared to the novel is the script adaptation. It needed to be a lot longer than it was, too much was marginalised to make it fit for kids attention spans. Or what Hollywood believes their attention span is.",Eragon

It doesn't come even close to the book. Of course its hard to film a good book, but at least give it a try. At some point I even thought I was watching a bad mad max version, and then almost at the end it looked like a bad version of Winnetou. The only thing that kept me watching was the dragon Saphira. But a dragon with feathered wings? OMG at least they could have done that right.Don't waste you time, read the books.",Eragon
514,hartlan,Could have been better,4,23 December 2006,"The story is there with lots of potential. Unfortunately, the movie is riddled with sequences with little to no transitions between them! The movie progresses here, then here, then here, then here, then here...there was little character development, making Eragon, the hero, difficult to believe. Additionally, so much was cut out from the story, it was hard to follow; thank goodness my son, who has read the book several times, was there to chime in the gaps...large gaps...but many of you may not have that luxury. Still, it was an entertaining movie that is watchable, just not great. The dragon scenes were well-done; but perhaps they should have invested more time in developing characters than flying around.

515,Nathanb_md,Don't see this unless you want to.,3,9 January 2007,"Eragon has the plot of an uninspired Star Wars and is set in a ghetto Middle Earth. This picture was most insightful in the ways of dragon communication or Vardon (the faction in opposition to the tyrant Galbatorix) hardships. However, even things menial as those were contained, rather simply, to the knowledge of their existence in the film. The only thing this film left me certain of was that being a dragon rider is hard work (not just the soaring on top of a reptile, but much more), and that magic doers filled with demons are, in fact, evil. Eragon can barely stand alone as a film and is hardly entertaining. The only reason I was able to watch the entire film, was because about half way through I decided Saphira, Eragon's dragon, was a male dragon with a feminine voice, and then the film became mildly humorous.",Eragon
516,TheBigMan-1,"""Eragon"" Disappointing to the End",5,18 December 2006,"I knew this film was aimed for kids, but the sadness of it brought me a whole understanding of what it means to be a rushed, over-budgeted, under-acted movie. Eragon looks like he just walked out of Algebra II and they slapped a costume on him. His hair is completely modern. And the kid's face is as clean as a peach. It doesn't matter if you scrub dirt on his face and dunk him in the sewer line, within a few minutes he's got a poster boy complexion again (He does get a cut on his face at one point but it disappears after a few shots).The acting by this film newcomer is extremely weak, though the writing didn't help him much either. The only strong point to the cast was Jeremy Irons who, as a seasoned veteran, pulled off his part with his natural stability.Most of the lines in the film are corny, and some shots look like they were cut and pasted from the Lord of the Rings (You know, those three movies that made about a gazillion bucks). But even the writing would have been much improved if the star didn't have the personality of a cardboard sheet. There was no flow to his dialogue whatsoever, he just rambled off lines like he was late for something. Seriously, Chuck Norris could act better. No really, that's not even a joke. Stop laughing.Special effects: fantastic. The Dragon: incredible. Movie potential: Very High. Story: Bleh. Acting: Worst thing I've ever seen (Stop hiring pretty boys and consider an actor next time). Conclusion: It shows how intelligent Hollywood thinks our kids are. It could be considered an insult.",Eragon

Especially the final scene It went from mediocre to down right awful. I was very disappointed. I satin the theater in awe that the script was approved. walking out of the movie theater it occurred to me that they must have used new dialog writers. If I were part of the crew I would be embarrassed to have my name on this film. The special effects and the cast saved this movie from getting a one. please wait till the video in the bargain rack at Walmart. The special effects were incredible but at certain points it seamed that the SFX team took shortcuts by speeding up the action this was especially evident during the final fight in the movie. it was very choppy and you couldn't focus on the screen. I can not compare it to the books as I just purchased them 2 days ago. This is the first time I have not found enough reason to give a movie at least a three star rating.",Eragon

Eragon was the traditional hero, thrown into war by his destiny, rather than any real choice, but later proves himself to be heroic. I personally disliked this character, but this wasn't to do with any faults in the acting from Edward Speleers, who acted well during the entire film.I preferred Brom, and he very much reminded me of Aragon from the Lord of the Rings, with his devil may care attitude, in fact the whole film had a LotR feel to it, with the breath taking scenery, and the similarities I saw between Eragon and Frodo.I haven't personally read the book, but I saw it with a friend who had, and who constantly criticised its lack of following the 'proper' storyline after like half an hour.A pretty good movie, but those expecting a carbon copy of the book will be disappointed.",Eragon

Even Jeremy Irons can't really save this flop, although he certainly does try. I guess the special effects are pretty good but I don't watch movies for special effects so that aspect doesn't impress me. The script should have been deep-sixed before it left the cutting room. Overall the acting is bad and the dialog is stupid and I just don't particularly like the characters I'm supposed to be rooting for. This movie does not do justice to its cast. I have not read the book, so I don't know if it was supposed to be like this, but the part where the dragon flies around some trees and grows about twenty years in a few seconds was dumb.",Eragon

The director hasn't learned to be patient and keep us hanging on the edge. Scenes are a little ill fitted and the plot flaws have not been ironed out anywhere as much as they should have been.Yet, for all its flaws and shortcomings, Eragon has something to it. It's uplifting and the main character's innocence, coupled with a world of fantasy and great scenery makes up for whatever the scripts lack in finesse.

Saphira's 10 minutes of acting was better than the rest combined. The storyline, even when it's not compared to the book, it sucked. It was very sparse and undetailed. The characters (minor) had 10 seconds of introduction, then disappeared. Eragon (major character) had 0 development. The settings were small and very poorly created. Lighting also was very unprofessional. Music didn't help at all. And I do not see how it will last to movie two let alone three. All this, and i haven't even compared it to the book yet.

All of these I could handle, if the movie even came close to the story of the book, but as with everything else, it was about as far away as it could possibly be.DO NOT go see this movie if you liked the book.

523,latejana614,I am appalled!,3,18 December 2006,"Okay, being a huge fan of the books, I was highly anticipating the movie. Well, all I can say, after seeing it, is I'm completely appalled at the extremely horrendous job that was done on developing this epic storyline into this...movie. There's no other way to describe my feelings but disappointment!! The only thing good I can say about it is the flying sequences are very well done. But that's it. Now for a list of the bad things: 1) Absolutely NO character development whatsoever!! It's like these people just appear on the screen and you're automatically supposed to know who they are and why they're there. And some of the characters, if you've never read the book, you wouldn't know who or why they are from a rock on the ground! 2) They don't stick to the storyline! Now, i understand why they changed Saphira's growth from days/weeks to just up-in-the-clouds-poof!-she's-a-big-dragon thing, simply because movie time needed to be spent on other stuff. However... the way Murtagh enters the story, his purpose for leading Eragon to the Varden, etc, is COMPLETELY WRONG!!! Murtagh may have...oh...possibly 10 total minutes of screen time if that. 3) There's no developing Eragon's abilities. It's just poof! he can do magic! 4) They cut out the dwarfs completely. There's no rescue when Eragon gets to the Varden. 5) The Urgals are not true to description. Big men with tattoos does not qualify as an Urgal!!! 6) Arya's character details are rubbish! Her ears aren't pointed, she has no real elf-like qualities, and the way she interacts with Eragon is completely wrong! From the way she contacts him when she's imprisoned and unconscious to whole communicating while still unconscious after being rescued thing...completely all wrong!! All in all, the story sucked...the characters sucked, and there's no staying true to the book, except with Saphira's description... other than that, the movie is horrible. Especially if you've read the book like I know so many of us have. My advice...avoid the movie until 20th Century Fox decides to apologize to Christopher Paolini and publicly grovel at his feet for completely ruining his excellent book, and then completely remake it with an accomplished director, say, Peter Jackson????",Eragon
524,cyberknightk,A massive disappointment,1,5 May 2020,When I originally heard there was a movie made about my favorite book series at the time I was very excited. Only to then watch this garbage and be incredibly disappointed. If you have ever read the books you know that this movie takes a big stinking dump all over the source material but even as a regular movie it doesn't stand up. They managed to make everyone unlikable and create this completely cookie cutter plot you've seen a million times before. They didn't even bother to give the elves pointed ears! Trash! The epitome of the book was better.,Eragon
525,UnmanlyerRoses,Do not mistake my rating...,10,16 December 2006,"This movie was an excellent MOCKERY of the whole film industry. It is a hilarious travesty featuring weak acting (with the exception of Jeremy Irons), and a jumpy plot which overrides ANY reputation of decency that could have been given. Instead we are stuck with rock, stupid boy, stupid rock, urgal urgal, bad special effects, and terrible-no-laughable dialogue. Some scenes are simply not believable, or are so completely inconsistent with the book that it was almost unbearable to watch.For instance: Where in the book, Eragon endures a long struggle to lift a pebble from the ground, he learns to blow things up and lynch Urgals with his magic tree-powers as simply as mastering a few rather irritating vocab words.For another instance of stupidity: During Eragon's first scene of actually riding Saphira, he prods her to 'show him speed' as it were, and yet while Eragon is practically flying backwards out of his saddle Brom manages to keep up below on his little brown horse. And in the end Saphira has the nerve to say 'what horse could out-run a dragon?' Well, Brom's certainly can! This movie is so terribly cliché and so painfully malformed that it hardly resembles anything better made then the sketch I did for German Day last year at a park with my friends. So if you want a 'Lord of the Rings Reborn', you'll have to look somewhere else. But if you want a jolly good laugh, then hand over ten bucks and I'll hook you up with a ticket.",Eragon

The movie has totally change the story, so many important characters are omitted, original storyline has been twisted to a point that anyone who has read the book would be disgusted by the movie.Casting is bad too, many characters are not suitable for the role they are playing, angela is suppose to be much more mature and older. hrothgar is suppose to be a dwarf, all the dwarfs are the same height as humans and some even taller than eragon, the twins has become ONE person.In conclusion, this is a B-Grade movie hoping to be a blockbuster.

Wide-eyed and with a noble heart, Speelers fills Eragon with a plucky spirit that is hard to resist. When you compare this farm boy's performance to that of Mark Hamill's (as the more famous farm boy) Speelers does an admirable job.What really sells the film; however, is the fantastic job done by the special effects wizards in creating a believable and engaging fantasy world for the audience to get lost in. The scenes of Eragon riding the dragon (crucial to the success of the film) are thrilling. You really get a sense of the speed and power of this majestic beast.The story is a bit thin and some of the performances leave much to be desired (not so sure about Rachel Weiz as the voice of a dragon); still there's enough here to warrant a repeat visit to the enchanted land of Alagasia, especially since this is only the first story in the ""Inheritance Trilogy.""",Eragon
528,jvclough,It is what it is,7,4 August 2007,"Many films have tried and failed to take the torch that was handed off after the Star Wars and Lord of the Rings Franchises finished showing. The scope and complexity of those films was intoxicating, but going into this movie thinking it will be Lord of the Rings or Star Wars is the wrong mind set, and honestly not fair. You can't hate a movie for not being what you wanted it to be. Those films were what they were, and this is what it is. This was an entertaining film. Even after reading the books it was still enjoyable, and I can't say the same for the Harry Potter Franchise. I think that this is a film that needs sequels to be fully realized. Viewers need to give it a chance, suspend their doubt along with their disbelief, and trust that the story will become more complex and entertaining as it progresses. That being said, Eragon will never be a Star Wars or Lord of The Rings, nor did the directors and producers think it would be. Sit back, relax, and enjoy the show. It is what it is.",Eragon
529,jylesa,Not Even Saphira Makes It,1,23 December 2006,"Honestly, all in all, it's an OK movie. I'm not saying it's the worst thing on the face of the earth. It generally sucked and it does not follow with the book at all. Why I say it's a good book? Just because of the special FX.The special FX team did a highly good job on Saphira as in making her realistic. And generally, the animation is high quality. Reason One: the feather/scales on Saphira are hard to animate and is a severe pain in the butt to animate every single one of those scales. Being an amateur at graphic design (for those who are interested, the programs I use are called Gmax and it's by Discreet and it's free and the other one is called Paint Shop Pro by Jasc which costs around 30 bucks at Fry's Electronics or someplace. This is more or less, a more toned down version of 3D Studio Max which is not a free program as it costs perhaps 500 to 3000 dollars as it is a professional program and in fact, I believe they use it for movies.) So they most likely took a lot of time into creating Saphira. Reason Two: Though Saphira's face needs a longer muzzle, but it's highly detailed and it actually shows that the people took care to make her look nice for the movie. The proportions are absolutely correct and I believe that she is genuinely and most obviously is very feminine. My one complaint about her is that she appears to be almost birdlike in the way she is designed as feathers are used on her and the wings appear birdlike in construction.Other things I believe about the movie that they had taken too much out of the book. Concerning the races, I believe they changed to much/ As I clearly recall there had been a large portion in the book dedicated to the dwarfs. That was taken out of the movie. All of it. The twins and Orik were completely deleted from the movie. Everything. And as for the elves, in the promo pictures, I saw Arya had no elves ears after someone pointed out. And I was honestly, quite hopeful that that was just a minor glitch in the poster and the error would be fixed in the movie. Unfortunately, it wasn't. Arya looked purely human. If I clearly remember, there was not even any mention of the elven race. I also took note that Arya had limited or absolutely no magical power. I remember a part in the movie where Eragon is trying to heal Brom after he is mortally wounded and finds that he can't. If I read the book right, she could have helped Eragon by using her magic but she didn't. It would be common sense to help someone who's dying right? Concerning the characters, basically, when I first saw the cast, I thought it was great. My complaints about it would involve Eragon and Roran looking like twins, or if not twins, brothers when it is clearly stated that Eragon and Roran are only cousins. However, Eragon's brother, (which I will not mention, just in case someone has not yet read Eldest yet) looks way different than Eragon himself. There is no similarity between the two; no connection. Other than complaining about Eragon, his brother, and Roran, the other cast is horrible. Arya, for instance, is very different than what she is described from the book. She has very red hair and, if I recall, blue gray eyes. But other than that, she does not seem like the wise sage she is in the book and has almost no magical talent despite her elven blood. Durza, basically, the actor is great for the part. He's been the antagonist in several other movies and he's great at it. Though personally, this opinion may differ throughout fans, but I always thought of Durza as a type of person who is handsome but eternally evil. In the movie, he's a sickly looking person, and I could almost mistake him as a human if his hair wasn't so artificially red. And as I recall, in the movie, he had creases in his face particularly around the eyebrow, chin, and upper cheek bones which make his face look like somewhat strange, and the markings look I shouldn't say penciled in, but pretty close. As for the Ra'zac and Urgals, they look horrible. Ra'zac, I pictured wearing some clock and aren't that chunky. You can tell they are men playing it. And another thing about them, I always thought they wore cauls. The only thing their wearing is a cloth around their waist. Generally, I also thought the Ra'zac were birdlike, because I remember reading they had beaks. No beaks. They look like regular men/rotted corpses and apparently are apparently crawling with insects. No offence, and not being girly or anything, but eww. The Urgals look like big men. There are no horns at all. Though they do look good for Urgals because the horns would probably make them look weird. And Saphira? As for her, like I said earlier, she looks good; the people did a good job on her. However I do not like the casting of Rachel Weisz as the voice of Saphira. I believed the voice of Saphira to be youthful in the beginning of the movie and to slowly progressed throughout the movie. Rachel Wiesz would have been perfect for me, at the latter parts of the movie. My one major complaint is her dialog is corny and can be trite at times and that really takes away from her charm.Generally, it sucked. Would I recommend it? The answer would be no. And if you really wanted to see it, wait for the DVD. Watching in theaters is not worth the money.",Eragon
530,meglew7,Honestly Disappointed,4,18 December 2006,"The actors were fantastic, the scenery breath-taking but overall, really disappointing in the content factor. I'm a huge fan of the books and have been getting everyone I know to read them but I honestly have to say, I'm not promoting the movie. It moved so quickly, things of importance were not explained at all and the content, I found, was so far from the book that I was constantly having to try and rack my own brain to remember what was going on. More time was spent rushing through scenes and making it choppy, rather than having Eragon developing as a character. The movie was just over 2 hours and honestly, they could have put in a few more things and risk the movie being a little bit longer, just so the movie would have some sort of flow. Hate to say it, but very disappointed. :(",Eragon
531,D-Devine,not what I expected,2,24 December 2006,"I had relatively high expectations going into the theater, and frankly, they weren't met. The reason I gave it this rating rating was because I read the book and there was just no comparison between the two. The book had suspense and flowed nicely, while the movie skipped a lot of scenes and jumped from scene to scene way to quickly. I'm not saying it was terrible, no matter what a two means, its just that I didn't think it really deserved to be called ""Eragon"" when it barely followed the book at all, so to someone who never read the book, the movie may have been awesome. In conclusion, I think that the movie should have followed the book better. I would not recommend bothering to go to this one if you are someone who gets disappointed when a movie doesn't follow the book it is supposed to based on, like me.",Eragon
532,calafalas13,"If it weren't for this movie, I wouldn't have believed that a story could be messed up like this.",4,14 December 2006,"I went to the movie with mixed feelings. On the one hand I was certain that it could never even stand in LOTRs shadow without being embarrassed, but on the other hand I happened to watch the trailer beforehand and thought it could at least be a fun movie.Well, I was prepared for it having several similarities to other movies/books/whatever, I had read the book before. But what I saw totally shocked me. And I mean the in a bad way: This one story has been badly screwed up. Not only that the characters are ridiculous, the story rushed and altered in such a way that Haldir's death at Helms Deep in LotR seems harmless compared to this, and cornerstone of fantasy film (at least for me) has been completely neglected.Elves, Dwarfs, Urgals? Apparently in their efforts on creating Saphira, the producers have forgotten that there are other races in need of their attention! Arya doesn't even have pointy ears and my friend didn't even get that she was and elf, but merely some princess. Whom I think could have been Orin didn't show any connection to a dwarf other than his beard - He was just as tall as Eragon. And the so-called Urgals were no more than normal men with tattoos. Pityful, honestly. With LotR, and even Narnia in the previous winters, Eragon could have been worth a bottle of glue more to stick some pointy ears on. As much detail as Paolini put into his story, this movie has disappointed me as a reader of the book because its lack of just these details immensely.The only scene worth the effort and the money for the ticket is Saphira's birth. THAT was adorable.",Eragon

If they had people might not as noticed ed speelers' horrible performance as much.I can say that i think i could have done a better job than speelers.As much as i can rant on the movie i still love the story and the characters and i wish peter jackson would have made it. He is the only director that actually will make a 3 and a half hour movie if it helps the story. they didn't even make eragon 2 hours. they could have made it so much better but i guess i got my hopes up.",Eragon
534,soccerchick9422,Eragon Rocks!,9,3 January 2007,"I just saw this today, and I thought it was fantastic! Ed did a great job as his debut. I thought he was awesome. And, at first you think you won't like him, but then he grows on you. The voice of the dragon was wonderful, dreamy but stern. The plot is extremely creative, and I loved the scenery! Oh, it was gorgeous. I think all of the actors and actresses did a wonderful job, and I really want to read the book. I think the ending should have been different, that'd why it's a nine, but otherwise, I think it was, overall, a great film. I hope there's a sequel, and if there isn't, well, I'll be very sad. Brava to the author. Great job!",Eragon
535,alienbat,"If you want to see a movie similar to ""The Lord of The Rings"", don't consider Eragon",3,14 December 2006,"If you're expecting a movie similar to the great ""The Lord of The Rings"" Trilogy, don't count on Eragon.Yes, it is going to be a trilogy (at least it's planed to be), and you will sure see many elements very similar to those appeared in the ""Ring"" Trilogy: elves, dark minions, shadow-like creatures mimicking Ring Wrath, orcs, dragons... But those won't make Eragon another legend like Ring Trilogy, not even close. They are all poorly designed without aesthetics and a feeling of reality. If you want to see some dragon-flying shot, Erogon do has plenty, but there won't be any surprises. You may possibly already seen such shot in Harry Potter 4. And that blue dragon in Eragon looked especially fake when it talks without moving it's mouth. (""Telepathy"" it is claimed to be, but I think it's the studio without having sufficient tech power to do it)The opening of the film is another simulation of The Fellowship of The Ring, with a speaker telling the background story. But it's just hollow, talking pure cliché with nothing mythic, although the speaker tries to use a mythic tongue and a lot of mythic words.The story? I didn't click the ""spoiler"" tag because there's just no much story to spoil. A farmer kid suddenly gets something powerful and he becomes powerful and he goes save the world, probably meeting some charming lady...sounds familiar isn't it? And hey! That world-saving boy just grows faster than you imagine -- 10 minutes ago he knows nothing but farming, 10 minutes after he's casting fire arrow and blasting a dozen of orcs all over the place. It's just fake.Conclusion: it's a pure waste of money for who makes it. And it's probably a waste of money if you go cinema for it. To be fair, I have to say: Eragon could have become some fast-food film that gives you some visual stimulation and you forget it when you step out the cinema. But with The Lord of The Rings trilogy already there, not even this is going to happen.",Eragon

This was a great movie, but did not follow the book very well. You cannot judge a book(In this case a movie) by its cover(In this case, a trailer)! This movie was widely advertised as all the characters on the posters being really important in the movie, but 3 of them had less than 10 minutes of being shown (Murtagh, Galbatorix, Ajihad). The dwarfs weren't in it, and the urgals looked like total ARTARDS! But the story was pretty good, it just need to be a little over 2 hours long(Unlike Pirates of the Caribbean 2). Brom being a rider, was too early in the movie, Murtagh wasn't as important as he was in the book, but he was well-acted, and the Ra'zac were not as they described OR had any lines whatsoever, and worst of all...YOU HAVEN""T SEEN IT!(To those viewers that gave it bad ratings.)

Indeed, i read the book. I agreed that the book is the best than the movie because the Hollywood changed everything.1: The missing part about whenever Eragon went to the store, there wasn't the girl and the man will coming in and brought the meat for Eragon's family. Where the heck was that? Yup, they cut that down.2: The Eragon's Family supposed to know about the blue stone and tried to sell the stone to market in the special events. It wasn't happening >:( 3: In the witch's hut, there was supposed to have the cat who can talk in the thoughts alike dragon riders.4: They cut the awesome magic is the dirt changed into the water. and the magic is about you wish to see people in the water.5: After uncle died, Eragon supposed to be sick and took care in the town. Then escaped with the old guy who used to rides the dragon.6: There was no DEWALT?! 7: The elves supposed to have point-ear???? 8: The horses are supposed to brought from the other town, not from uncle's house.ETC.I read the book three times.

538,eminentfreak,Why are movie genres never as detailed and thought-provoking as their counterparts in other media?,5,14 July 2007,"Dragon-themed fantasy novels are a case in point. Originally dragons were the aptly named bète noir of anyone from Bilbo to Saint George; then Anne MacCaffrey wrote Dragonriders of Pern and changed fantasy forever. One author was so impressed that he actually put her into one of his (dragon-themed) fantasy novels, albeit in cringeworthy fashion. Ursula LeGuin's are people in disguise; in Dragon's Blood they fight gladiatorial combats as public entertainment. Now Eragon turns them into glorified squad cars (anyone else catch that 'protect and serve' reference?) and combines Dungeons and Dragons themes with a cheesy takeoff of The Sword of Shannara and suchlike insipid Tolkein clones. Whereas I can't help feeling that this movie is Star Wars in disguise. Without Leia in a gold string bikini, and of course no one here prefers to kiss Wookiees over Harrison Ford. But the principle is the same, although the glowing swords are more LOTR than lightsabre. And this time, Obi-Wan has fashion sense.",Eragon
539,odie_ven,Fun if you haven't read the book...,8,19 December 2006,"Well I just came home from seeing the movie tonight.I really liked the movie, and gave it 8/10. Saphira was one of the cutest things I've seen since Cat with Boots (TM). However, I went with someone who read the book and their face was dreadful. I'll say this much about it: ""Don't say anything, because now I REALLY wanna read the books"".If you don't mind coherence and a few time-gaps for a faster movie (this thing should've been LOTR long) then you're on the right track. However, most characters are under-developed, and that's an understatement. You can notice the gaps in time very easily, and the ""races"" aren't very well represented. You guess some characters *might* be Dwarfs or Elves but you're never sure because they seem humans as well.And then there is the dragon. Unless some other great movie comes out, the dragon alone should win special effects Oscar... You basically fall in love with Sapphira right away. Other than that, it seemed a rushed movie, and I'm positive there will be an extended version (or hope so) coming out soon. If not, I still hope there will be room for MUCH improvement for the second movie.",Eragon
540,frederique-carre,Really disappointing scenario,2,1 April 2007,"My children read the book and really wanted to go watch the movie. I went with them and was expecting something that would remind me of the Lord of the Rings. I was very disappointed with Eragon.While special effects are good and the dragon has a real personality, the other actors don't seem to belong in the movie. I like Jeremy Irons and John Malkovich very much but their performance in this movie is just not at their usual level. While Peter Jackson was inspired when he picked Elijah Wood to play Frodo in Lord of the Rings, Ed Speleers does not manage to convince the audience as Eragon.But the worst part is really the scenario. I regularly watch movies thinking that they were too long and the director could have removed some scenes. In the case of Eragon, the movie is far too short, not allowing time to develop the various characters. Eragon seems to turn overnight into a hero with magic power while the book (my children told me) spent a lot of time showing the transformation of the farm boy into a dragon rider.The end of the movie calls for an ""Eragon 2"" but I hope that the producers will bring huge improvements to the scenario, the cast and the direction. My 14 year old daughter hated the movie (mainly because of the scenario) and my 11 year old son liked the movie (mainly for the special effects). It looks like I will be on duty for ""Eragon 2"", so hopefully the producers will read the reviews or will give up on the 2nd part!",Eragon
541,MartinusExLullesdorp,Popcorn Movie with lots of nice pictures,5,8 January 2007,"If one doesn't expect too much you won't be totally disappointed. Some good actors are on the set but they should have switched J.Malkovich as the King with the guy giving the magician shadow. This would have been more apt to his skills as an actor. I like J. Irons very much as Brom and Djimon Hontsou, but the latter as well is unchallenged. All other actors playing plain with not much expression. The story is flat. I never read the book(s) (as I have a hundred times with ""The Lord of the Rings"") so I can't argue on the contents. In terms of a movie there are a lot of fine landscape sequences in the Hungarian National Park which alone making it worth to see this movie. Fighting sequences, especially the big clash are much to fast and one cannot enjoy the tricks and actions. The end of the movie is somewhat disappointing, obviously leading to a sequel or two. In Armageddon I got out of the cinema rather fuming because of the stupid movie (I mention this because I seldom had the urge to leave the cinema BEFORE the movie is done). This one I left quite amused. Therefore I give 5 Stars. By the way, don't wait for the DVD. This one lives on the pictures.

I saw this movie with a friend of mine and he said Eragon looks like a young kid popped out from a toothpaste German commercial,and he was wright. -The best performance belongs to Jeremy Irons and even that happened for a short time,because he gets killed.Where are the elves? The Dwarfs? Where is the magic? No beautiful castles,no fortress like Helms Deep in The Lord Of The Rings,not to mention the movie it's incredibly short! -The sounds are awful,the plot is awful,looks like a movie made in a great rush,i think the producer tried to make it be like Peter Jackson's movie but it doesn't even come close! I have seen Peter Jackson's movie several times,from the beginning till the end,and it still has a sweet taste after watching it,this one i barely could see it until the end. -No great battles,no great battle scenes,the movie desperately trying to focus on the main character only,and the results are obvious:very,very disappointing!!!

This kind of artistry helps you disconnect from the real world and imagine that any of your dreams can come to life, this gives you the power to move along and search for solutions... at list that is how I fell. I hope that some day more people will get to appreciate the hard work that goes into something and try to read between the lines and thus discovering the true meaning.

Unfortunately for me, this movie even fell short of those. Personally I have NEVER seen a movie stray so far from the book. I cannot for the life of me believe Peter Buchman read Eragon. Unlike the book, the movie's plot is weak, the characters are underdeveloped and moviegoers have no chance to make emotional connections. For the most part the acting was poor (even though some decent actors were cast), the character relationships were poorly defined and often incorrectly defined and there was too little attention to detail (which I believe was done in a cheap attempt to shorten the movie). The special effects were well done but details were wrong as we Buchman's generalities. I was highly disappointed and will not waste my time seeing the sequel.",Eragon

Yes, it wasn't like the book, but seriously, it can still be a good movie! I LOVED it! As long as the movie keeps the main plot, it shouldn't matter. Sure, some parts were weird and not all acting in movies are perfect, but the movie shouldn't be put down so much. The one thing I didn't like a lot is what most people only like about the movie: Saphira's voice. I wasn't fond of it much, but it didn't stop me from loving the movie. I learned to like it, which is what people need to do more with the Eragon movie.

However once I saw a review for it I was very disappointed. The movie was supposed to be bad. However once I saw it I absolutely loved it. I am not the type of person who makes a big deal about changes. It has to be my favorite movie of December. Of course it is no Lord of the Rings, but it was not trying to be. The movie stands on its own to feet, and is completely different from the book. My suggestion, go see this movie, but don't make a big deal about changes because there are a LOT of them.This movie is about a 17 year old boy (15-16 in the book) named Eragon who finds a blue egg in The Spine while chasing a deer. When the egg hatches it brings him a dragon named Saphira. When the king sends out creatures to come and capture him he and an old storyteller named Brom must head towards the Varden (a rebel alliance) to help fight against the evil empire.",Eragon
548,kranki2,Movie is better than reviewed.,8,18 May 2007,"This is a good movie and does not deserve the bad reviews. If you like any of the dragon movies, then this one will be good. I have not read the book behind it and have only viewed the movie. It deserves a much higher rating than a 5 and I would give it closer to an 8. If I read the book, I might be less giving, but very few movies live up to the books behind them anyway.The only downside to the movie from my point of view was that it leaves you hanging for the sequel and I must admit that I hate that. However, lots of major movies have done that without problem other than you had to wait several years between sequels . Somehow Starwars comes to mind! Anyway, this is a very good movie; it just needs the sequel to finish the story.Personally, I don't try to over analyze the characters or the movie. I just look for one that entertains me! And this one did! Hopefully, you will find it to be the same.Last given some of the prior reviews, I am going to read the book which I rarely do and only because I believe that it will be very entertaining.I hope that you find the movie as I have found it.

549,animflashdragon,Its really not that bad,10,16 December 2006,"last night I was fortunate enough to see Eragon on its day of release, and I was optimistic about the fact that it had received such negative reviews, one friend in particular at school spent great pleasure all of yesterday morning parading a printout in front of my face telling me that the film had received 1/10 Christmas turkeys, and I spent the rest of the day telling him I would not trust the opinion of a website that rated their movies in turkeys.Going into the film I was not discouraged however, and as the film started, I thought they had hit the nail on the head, everything was as it should have been, despite for the lack of several key characters from the book never being mentioned by name. Roran looks exactly like the main character in question, and when I first saw him I actually mistook him for Ed Speleers. They have completely cut out several locations, such as Terim, and have instead had Angela's fortunetelling in Daret, and that important part of the plot was rushed by, with virtually none of Angela's predictions from the book being mentioned, the possibility of eldest begins to look slimmer.The end of the film however is the most disappointing, the battle of Farthen Dur, which is supposed to be thousands of Urgals charging through tunnels (they have also been replaced by men with tribal markings on their faces), instead a pathetic wall 5 feet in width is blown down and at max 40 men run through, I was not impressed. and as for the Varden being sheltered in a dwarf city, where the number of dwarfs greatly outnumbers the humans, by dwarfs I mean dwarf, just one short Scottish guy with a beard. Another thing which really bugs me, is the constant talking between Durza and the king, who has not yet been glimpsed in the first two books. The king is supposed to be constantly looking for the dwarfs and the Varden to try and destroy them, yet on the map of Alagaesia he has neatly pinned on his wall, he has all of their cities neatly LABELLED, come on fox. We also get a glimpse of Shurikan right at the end.so, the chances of seeing eldest, by the end of the movie, Roran is gone without a trace, and to bring him back would look very odd as he left to avoid conscription, the Ra,Zac are both already dead, there is one sole dwarf, no Somemnbum, none of the story of blessing that child (for which I am very thankful), the twins are none existent despite being in the cast list, there is no mention of the king having any other dragon eggs, Katrina isn't even in the film, and Sloan the butcher seems mildly kind to Eragon, not like the heartless monster in the book.I could go on, but I wont,because despite all this, it is a brilliant movie, even if it does feel a little rushed, (it was a big book after all), if you haven't read the book the plot may be a little confusing, but it is still a brilliant movie, not the longest movie in the world, but still brilliant.If anyone thinks I am tearing down the actors, then don't, the acting (especially from Eragon and Brom), is amazing, the movie is amazing, but whoever wrote the script should have harsh words spoken to them, the style of the script leads me to believe this movie was written by three people in a darkened room being paid £3:00 an hour, one reading a child rewritten copy of lord of the rings, one who is actually reading the book, abet just the blurb on the back, and god know what the third was reading.In summary brilliant movie, brilliant acting, brilliant special effects, just scriptwriters who should be buried in mounds of their own horrible writing. They haven't completely ruined Eragon, but they have most certainly ruined eldest.phew, glad thats off my chest",Eragon

I loved the book, and i thought that the movie would be very good. As it turns out, the only thing accurate about it was the character names. The movie depicted a boy who becomes a superhero without any apparent struggle. I know that every single minute detail could not be included (otherwise I would still be in the theatre watching it), but you would think that they would stick relatively close to the plot line. The special effects were disappointing, and the only thing that I really liked about it was how they did baby Safira. Other than that I would not recommend this movie for the fans of the book. If you've never read the book then by all means pay the $7.50 to go see it because you don't know what you're missing by not reading the book; just don't drag your friends who have read the book to go see it with you.",Eragon

If you go without any expectations you might just enjoy watching and that is it.What I mean is that for an epic like this, the movie watered down almost everything, and I wonder what the director had in mind. A quick box office success maybe? Well, in that case they should have done there work better than this.At the end of the movie I still had no idea about the characters, who they were, where they came from and what their meaning was in the whole story.Some parts of the movie look very suspiciously like scenes from LOTR, and I could hardly get exited at all. Remembering when I left the cinema after I watched the Fellowship of the Ring the first time.... wow, I wanted to enter the theater again right away (which I actually did). In this case I don't even expect an Eragon2....Special effects and music were lousy.Nevertheless, I did enjoy watching the movie. The dragon was the best of all, and the costume designers did a great job. Enjoy it for what it is, a nice fantasy to escape from the real world for 90 minutes.

552,Henny Button,I Had to Apologize to My Kid,3,18 December 2006,"My 11 year old son has been waiting anxiously for this movie to come out since he saw the poster this summer. ""Eragon"" is his favorite book of all time. I'll be the first to admit that the book is very derivative. The young author was obviously inspired by ""Star Wars"" and ""Lord of the Rings"" and borrowed heavily from both. But, the young author did a good job of writing an engaging story that stimulated the imagination.Naturally, we had to see the movie version of ""Eragon"" when it opened. Even if one hadn't read the novel, it would be awful. The acting was wooden and the editing was choppy. It was obvious that they had to cut a lot out of the action scenes to get that PG rating instead of PG-13. For those of us who have read the book, it was intolerable. You know a movie is bad when complete strangers start talking about how bad it was outside the theater. My son was so disappointed and called his 23 year old sister to warn her not to see it. He said he'd be warning his friends at school too.The only reason I gave this a 3 instead of a zero is that the baby dragon was so cute.",Eragon
553,freshprince2,Mockery of the book.,5,8 January 2007,"After reading a great book, and seeing it made into this, I am scarred for life. They left out at least 50% of the storyline. They took out all the important information to tell you about the characters. Eragon's rapid, one-day growth from a farm boy to a Dragon Rider is annoying. It is so retarded when Sapphira became a baby one minute and a adult the next. The characters are nothing like I thought. I sat through that movie agonizing over the chopped job. Bottom line, not good. I feel sorry for CP, his book being tortured like that. La La thank you and good night!!!! P.s. Arya's hot!!",Eragon
554,raiyanm,Does not do the book justice. At all. Period.,7,14 December 2006,"I'l just say this first...Eragon novel fans will NOT like the movie. Because I read the book, and I was very disappointed. The novel to movie transition was very bad. Everything was happening too fast. They didn't even make it 2+hour movie. It's not possible to make any good fantasy novel movie in less than 2 hours because that would mean cutting out parts of the storyline and character development. Movie is not very faithful to the book.Now, forgetting about the book and considering it a movie of its own. Edward Speelers has a very mixed performance. He showed some promise in the beginning but his acting performance was spoiled by his inconsistent acting and cliché(corny)dialogues. John Malkovich wasn't given enough screen time to do his thing. Durza(don't know his name) was an acceptable villain(does not do the book justice)in movie standards...probably helped by special effects. Sienna Guillory as Arya, was...not how she was supposed to be. She doesn't have pointy ears even though she's a elf and her hair and eye color was changed to avoid resemblance to Arwen from LOTR. Her acting in the movie wasn't great but decent. That's all I'm going to say. Murtagh and Ajihad(Hounsou), important characters, were shown very briefly. The only one worth my salt was Jeremy Irons as Brom, who gave a good performance. He was probably the only character with 3D personality. And the 3D dragon Saphira, even though she was voiced by Rachel Weisz, was clichéd and corny for most of the movie except some parts.Perhaps the one of the main reasons for lack of character depth is the lack of a good musical score and soundtrack. Nothing compared to Harry Potter and it's unthinkable to compare with LOTR.So I let the book color my judgement even though I said to forget it, doesn't matter.I'll give the movie 7/10, if only for the fact that I saw it in the theatre and the dragon flight sequences were pretty good and also that I liked the book so I don't want to give the movie too bad ratings. Because I'm sure others will.7/10",Eragon
555,Neldormiel,"Oh my gosh, how disappointing!!",1,5 January 2007,"I had been looking forward to the movie for two years--I thought it'd be idiot-proof to make such an awesome book into a good movie. But making a movie terrible is never impossible for Stefen Fangmier! He did it with Eragon! I laughed hysterically 3/4 of the time it was so corny. When you watch something like that, you can't help but wonder HOW ON EARTH the script made it to the movie. I mean, was that the best they could come up with? And the changes they made! It's as if the people who made the movie had a 9/10 burnt copy of the book, loosely based the movie on what they could decipher from it, then made the rest up.Guess how they made Teirm, the huge, glorious white city in the book. They made it a rinky-dink swamp town, inhabited by Urgals, with Angela living with them. Yeah, Angela lived with the Urgals.They really didn't follow the book at all, I am dead serious. They just took the names out of the book and followed the basic story-line: Eragon becoming a Rider and going to the Varden. They completely changed Eragon's personality, too. And Brom's. And Arya's. In the book, Arya was moody and guarded--in the movie, she FLIRTED with Eragon, and basically skipped as she fought the Urgals. I know, she's supposed to be light on her feet, but she was *skipping*--as she fought a bunch of Urgals.Here are the changes I remember: ----Instead of going to earn a living for himself and Katrina, Roran went to join the army----Saphira named herself ----Brom was killed by Durza, not the Ra'zac ----There were three Ra'zac, and Brom and Eragon killed two of them----Brom didn't teach Eragon any magic ----Eragon doesn't get the scar across his back----Durza ends up having some kind of spirit mount (!!!) ----They show both Durza and Shruikan in this movie, and we have no idea what they look like in the books so far ----They left out Orik, all the dwarfs, Jeod, Solembum, Horst, Katrina, the Twins, and someone else I can't remember ----Saphira grew in five seconds (literally) instead of a year----Instead of the Gedwey Ignasia being a silver oval, it's a red ""E""----It ends with Saphira and Eragon almost dying ----Murtagh is put in a rinky-dink cage right along the side of the battle, instead of a nice room with a bed and desk ----Saphira had a terrible voice and looked like a dinosaur with bird-wings ----Arya was a human ----Murtagh was only in the movie for five minutes ----Instead of being on the verge of dying when Eragon rescues her, Arya is as happy and chipper and healthy as ever----Zar'roc has a blue hilt ----Arya has cherry-blonde hair and blue eyes instead of jet-black hair and emerald eyes ----Eragon has blonde hair instead of brown ----Brom is half the age he should be----The Ra'zac, instead of having grapefruit-eyes and beaks and black cloaks, are wrapped up like mummies and constantly have bugs crawling all over them ----Garrow is not tortured by the Ra'zac ----Brom's horse (isn't his name Snowfire?), which is white in the book, was black in the movie----MURTAGH WAS FOLLOWING ERAGON AND BROM ON FOOT. He followed a dragon and horses on foot. THAT'S PRETTY DANG IMPRESSIVE. (sarcasm)----Murtagh basically begs Eragon to let him lead him and Saphira to the Varden, and Eragon trusts him right away, even though Eragon has no idea why Murtagh had been following him ----They give no back-story whatsoever on Murtagh. He just falls from the sky (literally--Saphira found him spying on them and dropped him on the ground in front of Eragon) and for some reason he really really badly wants to go with Eragon to the Varden, even though he was dead-set against it in the bookThere are a lot more changes, but this is already taking up too much room.",Eragon
556,zephyravictrix,don't bother,2,4 January 2007,"I wasn't expecting too much from the film, considering the standard of the book it was based on. However, this is _the_ worst dramatisation I have seen in a very long time. I feel sorry for the well known (and good) actors and actresses who had a part in this. The script started diverging majorly from the book withing the first 5 minutes if not sooner. Key characters and races were missing. The characters that did appear didn't behave anything like they did in the book, apart from eragon who managed 'teenager' reasonably well. By the end of the film the story had diverged to the point where it is actually impossible for a second film to be made, if it is to be based on the book 'Eldest'.",Eragon

I read it the month it came out and barely remembered anything, but was still EXTREMELY disappointed. There was WAY too much left out that they could have squeezed in in another 30 minutes. A lot of it was all fluff too which made me even more disappointed about it all. Hopefully Eldest will be a little longer and have more content in it. until then I guess we'll have to deal with this crapola. My recommendation for anyone that is in the process of reading the book or plans on reading it before they go see the movie--DON'T!

This movie is great if all you expect is to watch a CG dragon flying around. The graphics haven't improved much in 10 years since Dragonheart. The characters and story are all cliché. Evil villains with evil subordinates who have evil henchmen and more evil foot soldiers. The hero, Eragon, a farm boy who finds a teacher, has a girl to save and the fate of the world resting on his shoulders.The best part of the entire movie must be the ending credits where Avril Lavigne sang a bit of ""Keep Holding On"", but I'm sure we're all sick of hearing it over the radio. Also, this is the first movie where I saw them using full use of the widescreen format when displaying the credits. It starts off with the classic 2 columns, cast members, etc, but quickly splits into 3 columns and eventually 5 columns of names nearing the end.2/10 for the innovative credits. 2/10 for the movie... only because there might be a sequel which might save this movie.",Eragon

OH MY..... it STUNK. I can understand it being difficult to fit a 500 page book into a short movie but all the charm and sense of the book was COMPLETELY lost. My friend that I went with hadn't read the book so I was interested if he felt it was okay, maybe I was being too harsh because it strayed from the story, but no.. he said it was.. 'meh' .. and 'could have been better.' I spent the last half of the movie shaking my head in disbelief on what huge pile of poo the movie was. Please don't bother wasting ANY money on this garbage.. buy the book instead.... or buy ANYTHING else... buy 9 dollars worth of freaking tooth decaying candy.. go buy 'attack of the killer tomatos' on DVD .....just don't waste it on this garbage... its PAINFUL. ...

560,layamaheshwari,A HUGE Disappointment !!,4,25 February 2007,"When I came to know that we were going to be treated to an adaptation of the bestseller ""Eragon"" this Christmas, I was excited, to say the least. But when the movie came out, and I saw the reviews, my heart dipped, but still, I wanted to check it out for myself.And believe me, all the panning and criticism is correct. The movie is a huge letdown, and a severe heartbreak for the fans of the books. For all those who were fishing for another huge sci-fi epic saga after Star Wars and LoTR died down, I guess you'll have to wait for some other movie.The movie, just like the Star Wars prequels, chooses snazzy special effects over a solid storyline, and suffers the same fate as the Star Wars prequels. When the movie makers had such a great story to adapt from, and the backing of a major producer like 20th Century Fox, I don't know why they made such a blunder.Though we can forgive them if they say that they had limited runtime, but still, cutting essential things from the book such as Saphira's growth, the sparring between Eargon and Murtagh and believe it or not, even the bit of Togira Ikonoka !! The movie switches from the book to the modified script at will and makes a muddle of it. Though the backdrops are nice, and the journeys in the movie make one think of the scenery of LOTR, the natural beauty looks forced and thus, does not go down too well. The casting is horrible, to say the least. Fox should not have underestimated the potential of this saga and taken some experienced stars like Ian McKellen for powerful roles like Brom.I heard a lot of praise for the work done on Saphira, but honestly, I did not find it that good. Maybe, because of the mediocrity of the other factors, Rachel Sweesz' acting looks good.All in all, with a heavy heart I have to say that Fox have lost a huge chance to get even with Warner Bros. after LOTR and return to the days of Star Wars, but they have ruined it, and how !! Take my advice, skip the movie and watch LOTR / Star Wars again if you have no other options...",Eragon
561,deanadee,What a disappointment!!!!,5,17 December 2006,"I should have known better than to have read the book before seeing the movie. There was so much cut from the storyline and Murtagh (my favourite character) had so little screen time - what a disappointment. I wonder what Christopher Paolini thought when he first saw the movie. There was so much missed from the original storyline - I was expecting dwarfs (there was a distinct lack of them) and Urgals looking less like big bearded blokes and more like their description in the book. On the upside - the special effects were breath-taking and extremely well done. It's just a shame that the rest of the film - the acting (Joss Stone was particularly bad as Angela), the script (weak) and distinct lack of characters that you could empathise/sympathise with - made it just about bearable. I had so been looking forward to seeing this film and left the cinema feeling a little bit cheated.",Eragon
562,greengods,"May offer some enjoyable flight, at times, but never manages to take you anywhere significant",1,18 December 2006,"Riding on the wings of the fantasy novel-turned-movie fad comes Eragon, a film that comes off as purely lacklustre when all is said and done. Between dialogue that leaves the taste of rancid corn on your tongue, rushed plot elements (and some that just appear without bothering to contribute anything to the story) and predictable repetitions from everything else you've seen or read, it's hard to know whether the film's screenwriter and director were simply lazy or perhaps dropped on their heads as infants.While much of the acting is cringe-worthy throughout the whole piece, to their credit, some actors manage to make some good with what little they have. Jeremy Irons slips into the medieval mentor role with his trademark ease, although there's not much for him to do here apart from be his normal strong and charming self. Rachel Weisz - as the film's dragon - is given no dialogue that adds anything to the story, which hasn't already been said by someone else before and is left to give random token comments for nothing.Characters, who are made to hold our attention visually by their repeated exposure, often come to nothing. Little is made in the way of history, development, change, or even in-depth introductions. Audience members simply catch names and are quickly moved on.While some scenes are quite enjoyable in their soaring adventure elements, the film as a whole never really comes close to taking off and maintaining high altitude. Catch a viewing of it, if you want to hover over the grass a little for an hour and a half, but don't expect to be lifted up anywhere by this bland fare. It simply opens some nice ideas without delivering anything.",Eragon
563,aokichan,"Loved it, enchanting and beautiful.",10,16 December 2006,"I will up front say I have not read the books. So I know right there I'm going to get a lot of sneers and boos for not reading them. In all actuality the movie has driven me to want to read the books.Any how to the point. I really loved this film, it was visually beautiful and not over done with special effects. The acting wasn't outstanding, but it was good. Funny to say not much better if not worse than the latest Star Wars movies. The story I felt was rather rushed in the beginning. And it holds a similar theme to the classic ""farm boy thrust into chaos being the chosen one etc."" Personally I think it's a nod off the the classics, not some cheap cop off.The story was wonderful, and I'm sure the novel is even more brilliant and vibrant with getting into the intricacies of it all as books usually are. I do think they could have played out the beginning a bit longer, helping the audience to feel more like things have been going on for some time rather than BOOM stuff happens.I loved the effects and Saphira was gorgeous, she really did seem believable and real, like her own species, Dragon. Eragon's character was well done, though I'm sure in the novel once again it's much more elaborate. One thing that did bug me was that his wardrobe was awfully nice for being a mere farm boy. That leather?! The evil king, cant recall his name, actually a lot of the names I have trouble recalling they're not very memorization friendly, with the exception of Eragon and Saphira, just didn't seem evil enough. His acting was like Haden playing Anakin, but so much worse.I guess you could call this a spoiler but to those who've read the novel it's no surprise at all. When Saphira ""dies"" I personally was quite moved, it was a powerful scene and for me I really could feel there was a strong bond between Eragon and Saphira. Hell I even cried.The battle near the end was most stunning, and the visual effects helped more than hindered. I really loved this movie. I do however agree even though I've not read the novel yet they could have done more with it. I mean really? How many novel based movies can you say stick to their guns and do full justice? Honestly if it were me choosing the director, I'd pick Peter Jackson, he's a man who's shown us he knows how to stay true to the novel. It just takes a good director and a good budget and someone who's willing to stay true to the books. Not many do that. For what it is Eragon, the film is beautiful and deserves to be respected in its format. Another word on the director, I looked up his page on the site, and he appears he did a lot in the special effects department, so that explains a good bit why the story was lacking. The movie industry these days are so much on visuals and unfortunately sometimes and many times lacking in story. Eragon the novel, alone possesses much praise and adoration and that's what we will always go back to regardless of the film.So if you're a fan, you go see Eragon, I'm positive you wont be crazy about it but at least do appreciate it for what it is. There's a ton people put into movies like this, from story boarding, to scripting, to making the sets, costuming and filming etc.",Eragon
564,SerenityCelest,Very bad movie,1,15 December 2006,"So I just went to see the 'Eragon' movie and well...yeah.Here's a copy of the Eragon book*holds up a copy, then proceeds to throw it at the feet of Christopher Paolini, who then pulls down his pants, takes out his family jewels and pisses on the book* And that is what the movie did to it. Seriously though, the movie was one gigantic disappointment ESPECIALLY if you have read the book. They ignored important plot points, revealed secrets that weren't meant to be revealed and completely trod over the entire 'Higher thinking' part of the book, the part that keeps you wondering what happens next and surprises you at every turn. This was pure unfiltered crap, not even worthy of the ranking of 'B' movie. First of all the acting was atrocious, completely ignoring the fact that Eragon is dark-haired with brown eyes, they casted a blond blue-eyed surfer boy as the main character. A Surfer boy, I might add that couldn't act his way out of a wet paper bag, I've seen better acting at a third-grade school play. And while they might have chosen Ed Speleers, the 'actor' who played Eragon, for his looks; Garrett Hedlund, Murtagh, was much sexier and one heck of a better actor. However, in the spirit of keeping this movie as horrible as possible he was given almost no screen time, even though he was in more of the book then Brom. Did I mention I really hate this film? Not even Jeremy Irons', Brom, excellent skills as an actor could save this film.The Urgals were nothing more than ugly men who had too much fun with finger paint. The 'Dwaves' were taller than I am, and the Elves had no distinguishing features other then the fact that they were all hired from a Calvin Klein commercial. The entire movie had me wanting to drive to the house of Stefen Fangmeier, the Director, and demand my eight dollars back. If I was Christopher Paolini I would sue, and part of my demand would be that every god awful copy of this piece of excrement movie be completely and utterly destroyed. I never want this film mentioned near me EVER again, I will erase the nastiness of this film with the awesomeness of the books. I mean really there's ""The Book was Better."" and then there's ""WHAT THE @*$# WERE YOU THINKING!!!"" Obviously Peter Buchman and the other writers, never actually read the book, because very little of the original story line survived.

The movie doesn't really follow the book, but that is fine by me. I really liked how Saphira was portrayed, and I loved how expressive she was. I enjoyed Jeremy Irons performance as well. I believe this movie was entertaining and I would go to see it again if given a chance. Length-wise, I think the movie was just right...in fact, I found that the movie ended at just the right time without going into overkill nor was it a cliff hanger either. I do not know if there will be movie version of the sequel to Eragon (Eldest), but I am hoping there will be. Again, since the movie version did not match the book version it would be interesting to see how closely the second movie (if there will be a movie sequel) would match the book.

This has spoilers in it, so by all means, quit reading if you plan on seeing it.As a huge fan of STICKING TO THE STORY as much as possible, I was greatly disappointed. The book is usually better, but in this case, the screenwriters butchered a great story. There is no character development, the plot jumps along, and they only used an hour and a half to tell the story. Eragon should had taken at least two to two and half hours. While sticking to the basics (and I do mean BASICS) of the story, they changed so much or left so much out, that I do not see how they are going to do the second book as a movie. The character of Katrina, the butchers daughter, is not present (an integral part of book two). Roran went off to apprentice, so why did they change it? The town where they first meet the Ra'zac and another important town are mixed into a quick down and dirty rag-tag set that also leaves out important characters for book two. Most important, it fails to develop Eragon as a character we can feel for. We barely see Murtagh, or know much of his story. Unless you have read the books, most people won't make the connection between Eragon and Murtagh - again, important to book two and three.My advice is to read the book or listen to it on CD. You will get so much more out of it that way.",Eragon
568,defensor1,"I Came, I Saw, I Didn't Enjoy",1,16 December 2006,"This is a classic example of Hollywood taking an excellent book, and completely destroying it. The dialog was weak, there was absolutely no character development, and the action sequences (which is all the movie is, of course) were completely unconvincing. If there never was a book, this movie would have been stopped during production because it is THAT BAD. There are plot holes so wide you could sail an aircraft carrier through them. The actors were completely unconvincing in their roles, with the exception of a few shining moments with Jeremy Irons. The movie felt like you were in a 50-slide slide show where the person running it was saying ""all right we're running out of time so we'll just skip past half of these slides."" Here is what should happen: A) The movie gets pulled from theaters and all copies of it are completely destroyed (preferably burned). B) The Producers are fired and blacklisted for allowing such a horrible movie to hit theaters. C) The director never directs another movie ever again. Fangmier is a Visual Effects genius, I really enjoyed a lot of the movies he's worked on, but he should never direct again. D) The writer Buchman gets fired for writing such bad dialog, and again he didn't stay true to the book either. E) The Men in Black come and use their memory wipe device to purge that movie from the memory of everyone who was unfortunate enough to see it. F) We make Christopher Paolini finish writing the 3rd book in the series, publish it, then write all of the screenplays himself, hire Peter Jackson as the director and get some competent actors. This may seem a little harsh, but trust me you do NOT want to see this movie. I truly believe that this movie shows little effort on the part of the producers/director, and it is just another example of Hollywood banking on fan devotion to a previously existing series in order to draw in movie revenue and make a buck. Read the books, enjoy the books, but this movie is just not worth spending money and time on, especially when when you could be doing something truly enjoyable.",Eragon

No real explanation, no character development, no coherence with the original book plot line... if I hadn't been on a severe sugar high, I would have cried on the way home.What the hell was Murtagh doing? Turning up all over the place, randomly saving the overly corny, badly acted main character's behind, falling from trees, being overly American (Miiirtagh? WTF?)- no offence guys, and just saying, basically, 'I expect you to trust me, a random stranger, and I'll take you, another random stranger, to the Varden, somewhere 15 minutes ago you didn't really want to go to, and in the book, somewhere there was no chance in hell I wanted to go near either. Screw the author, I'm Fox's property now!' Oh, dear dear dear. Not good.When you sacrifice plot for visuals, you do have to have good visuals too, surprisingly enough, but they didn't manage on that count either, some of the time; though I'll give them credit for Saphira. Severe warping of the text- i.e. taking a blunt axe to it, hammy dialogue, bad acting (Jeremy Irons tried valiantly, bless him), often bodged CGI and severe plot holes were the failings of this film.However, my hat off to the good actors who were involved- one only in a vocal part, who would have excelled if other parts of the film had let them.",Eragon

Some of the most important characters and aspects were either missing or down-sized. Ajihad's role was changed from ""leader of the Varden"" to ""welcoming committee"", there was no sign of Orik or Hrothgar, and Jeod, one of the most important characters in the film. And what about all the months that Eragon spent with the Varden? According to the movie, about a day after Eragon showed up, the battle began.The thing that bugs me the most, though, is that it seemed to me like the person that wrote the screenplay had never read the book more than once. It's like they made a perfect version of the movie, and then, had a 5-year-old describe the movie to the screenwriter.I think one of the worst parts was how Saphira ""magically"" grew into adulthood. When I went to see the movie, one of the things I wanted to see most was Eragon raising Saphira in the woods, hiding her from Roran and Garrow, and so on.

So many changes, many characters missing, parts of the epic journey of Brom and Eragon just completely gone, events changed in a major way, motivation for actions totally ignored, etc. Even the characters are not described as in the book - the Urgals don't have horns, for one. And they have red eyes, instead of yellow. (See Wikipedia for the description of Urgals if you haven't read the books.) If movies like Harry Potter and Spiderman or the Lord of the Rings movies could use so many special effects, we see no reason for Eragon not to be able to show many of the scenes described so wonderfully in the books.

Paolini for his writing cannot write a decent novel at 19. I obviously can't, but I can read, and I love to read (don't we all?). I know that he got ideas from other books even those from three billy goats gruffs. I like the story, I actually read both books 1 and 2 at least twice. But I am really furious at how the movie and the script was made, people who did these should change their names because it IS awful! A 7 year old could've done better. Things I consider as downfall for the movie are: The Casting: there should be a careful consideration on the choosing. Arya for example was said as dark haired in the book and not blond. The Script: it is badly written and it made me wince every time they talk (or almost) it is so very corny. I usually like corny stuff but hell...this is the worst I've ever spent my 7.5 euros for! The blasted story was changed and opposites were shown! The urgals were made to look the tribal cannibals when they are supposed to be some version of a troll. And where were the dwarfs? Horst? the merchants...Special Effects: they've spent good money on the effects of the Dragon and I like the dragon but... nothing on the others... like the drawf kingdom under Beor Mountains, it should be in stones, marbles, a real gem instead of a primitive village with rice paddies!I'd like to see this story again as movie but... with better director, producer, script and budget - actors who played Eragon, Roran and Brom are fine as well as Saphira and her voice but the rest of the cast need changing or even play other roles. The girl who played Arya should fit as Serena. The story should end as it should like in the book..I think C. Paolini should roast the scriptwriter with the torn up script and fed to the scriptwriter's version of urgals.Thank you for reading.",Eragon
573,cychosis-1,"This movie is the new pardigm for the word ""STUPID.""",1,17 December 2006,"This movie is stupid and a complete waste of time. First of all, we all should have known it was bad when we saw that Jeremy Irons AND John Malkovich were cast in it. Remember Dungeons and Dragons?! I wanted to throw-up. Remember that Joan of Arc movie? OMFG! If you watch this film, and enjoy it, I hope you get eaten by a large giraffe, because you are utterly devoid of common sense and good taste.This movie was designed to fill in the void created by those LOTR nerds that no longer have anything to see, other than the Harry Pothead movies, and they only watch that because they are perverted. If the powers that be want to make a good fantasy flick, they should hurry up and make the Elric of Melnibone saga. At least then we can watch all the morons going around shouting the name ""MOORCOCK.""",Eragon
574,davidsjarrett,Fantastic Adventure,10,19 December 2006,"This was a phenomenal piece of story telling. While granted some of the plot nuances are a little cliché the overall story is very enjoyable. The acting, especially from the unknowns, is very believable. My entire family felt very moved in the more touching scenes and definitely fired up in the action scenes. The computer graphics was almost seamless. I can only think of one brief 2 second point in the movie where the image was off. WHere the main character was in the background and was slightly(unintentionally out of focus, to the other character in the foreground. One scene in particular reminds me of daydreams I had as a young boy. An excellent family move and I would heartily recommend it to anyone. One of the few movies I have seen in the past year that was worth the price of admission.",Eragon
575,ecarlson-11,"If you've read the book, don't bother to see this movie!",1,18 December 2006,"This is quite possibly the worst screenplay/movie ever taken from a best selling book to the big screen. Whomever decided that this movie should have been produced in this fashion should be shot! Weird Al could have done better! Not only should the screenwriter have at the very least read the book, but the producer/director should have read it as well. NONE of the important content from the book was included. The time-lines were completely off.Brom taught the wrong spells to the kid. The saddle was a leather horse saddle and could never be passed off as rope saddle designed to let a rider ride WITH the dragon, as opposed to only being an unwitting passenger. Arya seemed infatuated with Erragon. Why was she even conscious before they reached the varden? Brom died in a cave with Saphira and Murtagh. They never even crossed a freaking desert so Erragon could get water from the sand! The giant crystal was never broken. The wound from the shade was totally glossed over. Ajihad never died, his daughter never came to power. Erragon never allied with the Varden. The Dwarf helm was never presented. The Adoption never occurred. And Arya left for Du Weldenvarden without the Dwarf and Erragon.ARYA (the elf) HAD HUMAN EARS IN THE MOVIE! WHAT ELF DOESN'T HAVE POINTY EARS! I am so saddened that Chris P. sold off the rights and did not retain creative control over these projects. They are not even a shadow of what he depicted in his book. They could have done much much better had the done Erragon in 2 parts. I hope someone throws this version out and the redo the whole thing. I would keep Jeremy Irons and John Malkovich though, and actually let them act this time!",Eragon
576,qlawman,Registered just to review this movie,1,19 December 2006,"I registered with IMDb for the sole purpose of reviewing this movie.It is an atrocity, and I mean that in every conceivable connotation of the word.If you have not read the book, than you might give a 5, but even then it does NOT deserve it. I'd say, at it's very best and if I wouldn't have read the book that this movie would rate a 3.There wasn't a single transition in the whole thing; the plot just kept on hopping from point to point leaving the audience in a constant state of confusing frustration. Or, at least, it might have been confusing had the movie kept any of the intricacies of the original plot as outlined in the novel. One second Brom and Eragon are happily sparring along a river, when mere seconds before, and close by(as the audience is led to assume) a group of Urgals (which have been morphed into fat, bald men with blue tattoos) were ravaging some poor group of people on the side of the road. Eragon, whom is constantly portrayed in the movie as having ""1 part courage and 3 parts fool"" doesn't seem to care. What a big heart.That's just one example. Suffice to say, my 15 month old niece could have done a better job at producing this movie. It is ALMOST as bad as Battlefield Earth! Heck, it's right on par with Bloodrayne.It is an insult to call this a ""B Movie"" as I have seen a few good ""B Movies"" in my time. This movie kind of falls off the grading-scale charts. It's bad.They skipped so many intrinsic plot points that they couldn't possibly make Eldest into a movie and call it ""Eldest."" For one thing, there is no love interest for Roran, and he just up and leaves because ""he's of age."" What's Roran going to do throughout the entire second book? Arya is not an elf...the least they could have done was throw on some tapered ears...so if Arya doesn't look or act super-human, what difference would Eragon's transformation be in the next book. Eragon does not get scarred from the shade, and Murtagh's scar is some tribal looking scratch.Christopher Paolini should be insulted, and whoever is responsible for this nonsensical ""interpretation"" should be arrested and forced to watch their own horrid movie over and over again for a span of at least 10 years.Yeah, I know I'm coming off a bit harsh, but I can't impress upon you enough that this was a huge let-down. I just hope that this serves to help some of you save some money by avoiding this movie. As another reviewer implied, you will find this DVD in bargain bins in a couple of weeks and will probably be able to buy it online cheaper than you could rent it in a store. Just wait until then",Eragon
577,dragonheartr-1,Bad direction and poor script-want my money back.,2,19 December 2006,"you spend the whole movie waiting for something to happen. By the time it reaches the end, you realise that it is nothing but a poor attempt to re-copy the Lord of the Rings, combined with poor acting and direction. Brtis should be banned from acting in vigorous roles that try to stir emotions. Anyway, who ever hired the person in charge of battle action should be put on trial. It is a clear example of a failure to imitate the Two Towers, even the shadow magician and the traitor in the Two Towers look almost identical. Please remember that this movie has NO moral purpose what so ever, which combined with its other failures, make you want your money back.",Eragon
578,roshi_rosh_06,Eragon--Epic or Flop---Hmmm... FLOP!!!!,3,3 January 2007,"I have read the book--thought it was OK, but sounded too much like Lord of The Rings--but i enjoyed it never-the-less. When the movie came out I thought that I would give it a shot and see what it was like--the trailer seemed exciting enough.So i wandered into the cinema, bought a ticket and some popcorn, sat down in the theatre.Later I walked out feeling just a little--no very--disappointed. Yes the graphics were good--but to be honest I think that the crew spent more time on graphics rather than the storyline or the actors. Edward Spleers comes across to me as one of those wannabe child-stars. He looks constantly petrified looking better without any expression at all on a face that looks as dim-witted as he acts. Jeremy Irons didn't even make an effort to become a memorable character. And really a petty cartoon antagonist could have made a better job as a villain than Druza's character whose lame taunts and unimpressive powers served as pointless thorn in the side of any fantasy fan. The only thing that really impressed me was the dragon Saphira, with the vocals of Rachel Weiz. A CGI dragon that has more life than the zombified human cast--something is definitely wrong. Just a word of advice to any member of Eragon cast or crew reading this--please ditch the corny hero and villains and rewrite the script so that it is somewhat less rigid. Stop jumping from scene to scene like a dog with a huge infestation of fleas. And please--please!!! stop trying to be Lord of The Rings--because that isn't going to happen in this dimension.So I sadly conclude that this film is a BIG FAT FLOP!!!",Eragon

The effects are good and the baby dragon was cute but beside that, everything stunk! The outline of this movie was really bad. Good for a book but bad for a movie. I really hope the makers of this movie do not make a squeal. I was kind of looking forward to this movie because the book was pretty good but the movie just killed it. It was like a Harry Potter movie but worse. I don't really recommend this movie but if you're really into movies that have to do with fantasy then you might like it. But the effects were good I have to admit that. It was bad and the actors were scary. Sorry.",Eragon
580,LarGallo,A truly horrid affair.....,1,20 December 2006,"My whole family absolutely loved the book.....all of us. We HATED this movie. Instead of saying ""based on the book by Chris Paolini"", it should have said ""Sort-of based on some ideas of what a screen-writer who didn't read the book might have dreamed up"". The characters are thin, the action is forced and the sets are a major disappointment (especially Tronjheim). I expected some shortening of things and reasonable omissions, especially with a run time of only 1 hour and 39 minutes. I did NOT expect a complete rewrite of the story. Essential characters are left out, plot lines are omitted completely changed, and event sequences are rearranged in a completely random manner. Please do NOT waste your money on this film even if you haven't read the book. The movie will NOT make you want to read it and that is a shame as the book is a great read no matter where he got some of the ideas from. I wouldn't even waste 2 dollars on this as a rental....as a matter of fact, I won't ever watch it on TV either!! BAD MOVIE!!",Eragon
581,agualizard,Fox should have been throwing $$ at this movie.,1,23 December 2006,"Downright pathetic. Fox 2000 should have been throwing millions at this movie. Eragon had a chance of being another Harry Potter or Lord of the Rings to the Cinemas, just on the reader base of Paolini's books alone and the fact that who doesn't love a dragon? $30.3 million worth of tickets during its first weekend of foreign releaseNo. 2 in North America $23 million, First in Germany ($4.1 million); Spain ($4.2 million); Mexico ($2.3 million); Thailand ($1.1 million). It was No. 2 in Japan ($2.2 million) and No. 4 in the U.K. ($2.7 million). But instead of a great movie we got a cash cow, built with no conviction that strays far from Paolini's story. The only money they put into it was advertising. Come on Fox! A first time director, first time screenplay writer, No Elves???, No dwarfs???? Bad pace, bad character development, poor acting, bad editing, and the list goes on. ... Perhaps they should have all read the book before making a movie out of it! Out of all the books I have seen made into a movie this is the biggest travesty of them all. The story line was rushed, yet they had time to add in pointless shots of eragon sitting and thinking?My honest opinion is that everything about this movie and how bad it sucks probably comes down to the budget Fox forced on them. I don't see a future with a second film unless scrap this one and start over.As far as the book, well if you haven't read it and only have seen the movie, then go to a store today and buy a copy. Right now! You'll thank me.",Eragon
582,ebonywand,People....it's entertainment for crying out loud!,8,30 December 2006,"Okay....it's my turn to get on the soap box. Read the book. Loved the book. Found out they made it into a movie. Saw the movie. Loved the movie. Here's why.First of all, I walked into that cinema with an open mind because, let's face it, how many of you have seen a book-based movie that was exactly like the book? As the film began to roll, I prepared myself for anything. I had read horrible reviews on the movie, so I was expecting the worst. I found myself to be pleasantly surprised.Here are some things in the movie that have been said to make it horrible. Let me point out a few things.1. THE MOVIE WAS TOO SHORT. I have to agree with you there, but that didn't make the movie horrible.2. THEY LEFT OUT TOO MUCH. Well, consider this: a great portion of the book is spent following Brom and Eragon running around trying not to get killed. You can only use up so much movie time with that part of the story. I think that they could have put in some more details to make the movie longer, but as far as I'm concerned, all the major plot points got put in there, and nothing was left out that can't be introduced to the story line in later films. Personally, I think that the next film will be longer and better.3. THE ACTING WAS TERRIBLE. THE ONLY GOOD ACTING WAS SAPHIRA. Not that I disliked Saphira, I actually quite enjoyed her character, but I think there is a little more credit to be given to the rest of the cast. Jeremy Irons is a fantastic actor. I was thrilled that he was cast as Brom, because that's exactly how I pictured him. Ed Speelers did a terrific job as the lead, especially for a first-timer. Robert Carlyle was perfect for the part of Durza. In short, I think that the film makers did an excellent job of casting.4. THE MOVIE IS A DISGRACE TO THE BOOK AND TO CHRISTOPHER PAOLINI. Well, I have not spoken to Christopher Paolini on the subject, so I cannot write this comment knowing his views. However, I do know that authors of books sell rights to film companies to make films of their books, and while they might not have control over casting, script-writing, and production, it has to be initially approved by the author. That being said, Christopher Paolini must have thought that the movie was pretty good to approve it. Also, movies are never going to be exactly like the books, so just get over it.In closing, I would just like to say that it's just pure entertainment, nothing more. The film was made for no other purpose than to entertain an audience for two hours and for people's enjoyment. Stop over-analysing it.I might also add that I saw the film in a full cinema and nobody got up and left early or booed the film. At the end, the audience stood up and applauded. I was clapping right along with them.",Eragon
583,jstar-6,Christopher Paolini Should Sue (Spoilers),1,24 December 2006,"-Spoilers Ahead so please read with caution- I was skeptical of the book but I read it and really enjoyed it so I was excited about the movie coming out. Unfortunately they did not make a movie that was even remotely like the book. They totally left out Eragon chasing the Razac how Garrow died was completely wrong the trip to the Varden was a joke the time at the Varden before the Urgals attacked was non existent. Eragon's training was all but skipped. Brom's involvement and death was totally wrong. Arya's rescue was all as well as her interaction with Durza and her poisoning, Eragon never even get's arrested and taken to Gilead and Murtagh just shows up for no good reason. The end battle in Farthen Dur was nothing like the book and the book's was way better. The end over all was a complete catastrophe as they have Eragon staying with the Varden and Arya heading of to Ellesmera without him which is not what happens (Read Eldest). The only reason I did not give it a 1 is the special effects were good and Saphira (the dragon) looked great. Overall if I had spent so much time crafting an adventure I would never have allowed my story to be butchered like this just to have a movie. Use the ten bucks for the movie ticket and buy the book instead it's much more entertaining.",Eragon
584,lindascotti,Pale Imitation of the Book,1,27 December 2006,"If you're looking for a good film from the novel, please forget it! Characters, episodes, acting: everything seems to work against an enjoyable experience. The screenplay is a wholly different story, which consists in some spectacular flights and battles, but... that's all!Eragon here is a good looking teenager, who wears the same face from the start to the end. There's neither psychological identity, nor a sign of evolution. You can't understand how he learns to fight or how he can use words of the ancient language. After battles, his face remains white and relaxed like a child one. If you read the novel, you can love details, characters, emotions. In the film, there's only a pale bad imitation, covered by special effects. In sum, I feel disappointed and I suggest to avoid this bad film.",Eragon

The movie only had the faintest ties to the book, and the sets and costumes were horrible (it looked like Eragon and Roran were wearing jeans and long sleeved tee shirts for half of the time!). I loved the book, and I went to see the movie for my birthday. I almost asked for my money back, it was that bad. The actors weren't all that good (except for Saphira, I liked her), the writing was horrible (you're not going to get anything out of a movie if you play the whole stinking thing in fast forward! Well at least what Arya said in the end made sense because of that.), and the only thing that was good was Saphira! When I went to see the movie, the little kids were crying, and the adults were cursing at the movie screen. I don't blame them in the least.",Eragon
586,uruthchronicler,Eragon,3,29 December 2006,"As far as movie adaptations of books go, Eragon is probably one of the worst. I loved the book so much and had hoped that FOX would produce a dazzling epic to rival Peter Jackson's The Return of the King. After viewing just a single trailer, I already had about a dozens criticisms. Reluctantly, I saw the movie. The movie is too short and not only were parts left out (which I knew would happen), but the movie strayed so far from the book in terms of the storyline. Important places and characters were left out and those included were dramatically changed. I had also expected a spectacular battle, but, with a PG rating, that wish was terminated. On the up side, the animated Saphira is simply beautiful, as was the scenery in the film. Jeremy Irons (Brom) and Robert Carlyle (Durza) were the highlights of the movie. Ironically, they are both killed off. I say a remake of Eragon, in the hands of Peter Jackson rather than FOX, would be better.",Eragon
587,sweetsugar_13,Destroys a great read,1,5 August 2007,"This movie was by far one of the worst adaptations of a novel. The one thing that if does have in common with the novel it the title, and even that makes me cringe at the thought that someone would be so cruel to destroy such a great novel. Save yourself two hours and actually start to read the novels, if you haven't already. I'm sure many would agree that is someone were to actually create a proper screenplay and adaptation of the novel, that the film could be a great success as goes with many other fantasy movies/novels. This kind of makes me wonder if the author even had a say in this film, or whether they(the directors and producers) just went ahead and did whatever they felt would benefit them in the long run(money). Let's just hope that someone were to do the second installment, then third, it should be someone different then who did the first film, and before the person started they may want to re-think, and maybe re-do the first film in the process. One another thing that bothered me to the core of my being, was that Christohper Paolini gave excellent descriptions on the appearances of all his characters, locations, and battles, and in the film not one person, not even the dragon(though it was the best acting) matched his descriptions, isn't Saphira meant to be a Sapphire blue? she looked baby blue in the films. Don't waste your time, it's two useless hours you'll never get back.",Eragon
588,fffan231,Wonderful,9,1 January 2007,"I am a very big fan of the Eragon books. I have read Eragon four times, Eldest three times, and I'm ready too read them again. They are my favorite books. When I heard about the movie a year before it's release, I was very excited. I was afraid of big changes, but still couldn't wait.When I finally saw it, I was in awe. There were only three disappointments.I didn't like how Saphira flew in the air as a baby and came down as an adult, and chose her own name. Also, the close relationship between Saphira and Eragon could have been portrayed much better. My biggest disappointment was that the movie was too short.Other than that, it was perfect. The other small changes were forgivable, and the actors were perfectly chosen. They did a wonderful job.Saphira was programmed better than I pictured her. She was very convincing in her movements, and very beautiful. Her voice was a perfect choice.The music was beautiful. Every score was captivating and had the perfect feel for every scene.Being a big fan, I had my disappointments, but it was a dream come true to see my favorite book turned into a beautiful movie, and I hope for the entire series to be made.",Eragon
589,jesse-cody,Hmmm...so that's what a disaster looks like...,5,3 January 2007,"OK, where do i start.the movie had a good amount of popularity going for it due to the books before even getting on screen, which is why it has made so much money so far. I can't claim this is the worst movie I've seen, but it will disappoint.The actors are really very good, most of them anyways (The main character Eragon says so many annoying or obvious lines that he quickly becomes your least favorite character.)All in all, the movie is OK, but not worth buying.The biggest flaw is that it doesn't give you enough time to take in the characters, or the story for that matter. It feels like everything is just thrown at you, and when you finally get to the battle, your saying to yourself...that's it? That, in fact, is not it. The book is great, read it, and you might actually enjoy watching the movie just to point out the flaws and differences. They leave out a huge amount of story that is important to the movie. For example, the character Murtagh, who is in around ten chapters of the book or more, has 3 lines, only one of them of any importance to his character, and even that line is not made to look important the way it should have. This movie is a disappointment, nothing more. i would have liked to have seen it in the Lord of the rings fashion, long but well worth it. action sequences are so short you blink and miss them, and most lines are corny ( the character you end up liking the most is either brom or saphira, which is a little bit sad.) Would I suggest watching it? Only if your ready for a disappointment. It's not a nightmare,but it definitely doesn't give the book justice.",Eragon

The actors were all really good and it had a good storyline. I thought the overall plot was easy to follow. Also, the dragon looked excellent. The sequences where Eragon was riding the dragon were amazing. I did not think this movie was boring or unoriginal. Even though the beginning was a little slow, it improved a lot after that. The battle scenes were fun and exciting. Since the series is a trilogy of books, hopefully the other 2 will be made into films. Anyone who likes fantasy/action movies should see Eragon!

It's too guddamn short for a 500-600 page book :| ) I DO want the time I spent downloading the movie (time I could've spent downloading something else) back ! There are a couple of good things to say about this movie: the voice cover (Rachel Weisz) was good, same as Jeremy Irons's play and the special fx. Now...The storyline was too ""fast-forward"" ( I didn't get a lot of things cause they weren't explained. It was like: John has apples thus John must die :| ), Edward Speleers was too ""Raw"" to play in this movie (cause he's at his...hmm..oh...first maybe second role.. yah! that must be it) and I didn't see any elves of dwarfs or whatever weird and magical beings were mentioned by the characters.*walking away* I'm gonna go read the book now ...",Eragon
592,phantomphan-3,One of the worst movies I've ever seen!!!! (and i've seen it 3 times),4,4 January 2007,"Kay, the only reason I gave this movie a five was.....MURTAGH!!!!!!! he saved the movie. Other than him it sucked! (scratch that, Durza was pretty cool.)(But then again, I wouldn't see this movie three times for Durza. Ewww.) Okay **SPOILER WARNING** just to warn everybody.Well, The beginning sequence was so so. I liked it except for, how the heck did the elves not see Durza when he was standing directly in front of them? I mean a shade standing in the middle of the road is a pretty good sign to turn around or fight or something. Oh well, thats why they died. Durza's torture was really cool. Sienna Guillory was such a good Arya. She had a really convincing performance. After that he movie went downhill. The first time I saw it I found it impossible to follow the storyline, I mean Brom hardly mentioned Morzan which means that when Ajihad said the Murtagh(really long sigh) was Morzans son i didn't exactly gasp. And i had no clue what the Varden was about. It just made no scene. The second time i saw it i had read the two books so i could tell how bad they screwed up. Now to go just a bit crazy.... I did not really enjoy the movie until Daret. Daret is where we first meet (gasp) MURTAGH! But of course having read the book I see how badly they screwed up Angela. And where was Solumbun(sp)? How will we know about the Menoa Tree or the Vault of souls? And Angela never mentioned the betrayal in the family which will be really really really important in the next move (if they can salvage the second movie from their trash heap). Well, then i was happy in Gil'ead(sp) When we saw a little of evil Durza and a little of MURTAGH (fangirl shriek). Then i got mad when Arya let Brom die. She's a freaking elf (and princess of Ellesmera as she revealed way too soon)if she had wanted to save Brom she could have. Then poor Brom kicks the bucket and who shows up.....MURTAGH!!!!!! ""All my life I've dreamed of dragons."" (really really long sigh). Though i was very angry that he didn't get more screen time, he's not a minor character, but they gave him such a small part that they might as well have cut him out altogether! Oh. and why did he agree to take Eragon to the Varden? That was soooo out of character! In the book they had to all but drag him there! But I was happy that he got wet. (sorry that was the overly obsessive fangirl getting the best of me) And his scar was all wrong! it was supposed to stretch the entire length of his back (which would have required him to take his shirt off to show us) not 6 inches on his side! and does getting a sword thrown at you produce a scar like that? Then he gets locked up for a reason that those who haven't read the book barely understand. Then in a few minutes we get to enjoy Eragon totally flirting with Arya before the battle. ""you look.... fit for battle"" I mean shut up!! Then the battle scene which is OK but i didn't like Durza's dragon thing. i mean were they so desperate for a dragon vs. dragon fight that they had to invent one. hey why not just completely screw up and bring out Galbatorix himself or worse yet just speed forward a few months and have him fight Murtagh and Thorn. But then to attempt to end the movie on a good note we get a clever line from Murtagh, ""Some friends can't be replaced........luckily some don't have to be"" Gotta love it! Then they mask it with the stupidity of Arya flirting right back with Eragon. Oh yeah, that really works with her REJECTING him in the next book! What are they gonna do Eragon: ""Arya I love you!"" Arya:""Sorry i'm way too old for you."" Eragon: But in the last movie you totally flirted with me!"" Arya: ""I'm just a tease."" Yeah, lets see how that works out. All in all it could have been so much more.....well, more.(Oh snap I totally used a movie quote! Eat that!) It wasn't a long movie, If they stamped on another 45 min. it could have been so much better, but hey people are stupid.To sum it up.....If you've never read the book you might like it for the perfection that is Murtagh. If you have read the book don't see it you'll puke.",Eragon
593,chaoticcranium,George Lucas should sue. . .,3,6 January 2007,"Seen Star Wars Episode 4? Good. Now, change it to a Lord of the Rings-esquire setting and throw in a l33t dragon and you have Eragon.To prove my point, here's a brief summary from what I recall: (SPOILERS) The world is ruled by the evil, dictatorial Emperor Galbatorix (ie, Palpatine). Princess Arya (ie, Leia) steals a dragon egg (ie, the Death Star plans) from the emperor, and Galbatorix sends his right hand man, Durza (ie, Darth Vader), a Shade wizard to pursue her. Before being captured by Durza, Arya teleports the egg. Enter a farm boy who lives on his uncle's farm named Eragon (ie, Luke Skywalker). He finds the egg, and it later hatches into a dragon named Saphira. The empire's soldiers figure out where the egg went and they raid the village. However, the boy is saved by an old mentorish figure named Obi Wan-- er, I mean Brom. It turns out that Brom lived in an era where dragons and humans coexisted and that he was one of the elite dragon riders. Galbatorix too was a dragon rider in this period, but he used his power to stage a revolution. Since then, Brom lost the life of his dragon and everything else he held dear. Anyway, Brom and Eragon flee to some port city (ie, Mos Eisley), where Eragon learns how to use magic to save Brom. They then head for the headquarters of the resistance against the empire (ie, Yavin IV), but when Eragon receives a dream of Arya's demise in the evil empire's captial (ie, Death Star), he abandons Brom and takes off for the castle. He sneaks in and finds the princess, but the wizard Durza locates him and engages him. Eragon survives, however, with the sacrifice of Brom (he even dies the same as Obi Wan) and the help of Saphira and a rogue named Murtagh (ie, Han Solo), who was the child of a dragon rider who supported Galbatorix but does not believe in his father's ideals. He flees with the princess, who has been cursed, Saphira, and Murtagh. They reach the resistance bade and the princess is healed from the curse. However, Durza uses them to locate the base, and he sends his soldiers to try to eliminate them. A grandiose battle ensues, and Eragon engages Durza and defeats him. Fin.Now, I happened to enjoy the movie, but as I have demonstrated, this movie drastically lacks originality - it follows the same archetypical epic that Star Wars Episode IV pioneered (at least, in the movie business). You've all seen this plot before, and it is getting stale. The special effects are great, but the dialogue is corny (also like Star Wars, but it was forgivable for its time). Acting is decent, but without substance its really just a waste. I haven't read the book, but I hear the film's plot departs substantially from it. I also hear the book is far more original and entertaining then the movie.",Eragon
594,lisbertbb,Great Movie.,7,23 June 2007,"I absolutely love this movie. I haven't read the book, but the movie was great, fast pace and easy to follow along. Some people despise it, but the thing about Hollywood is that they change books a lot to create a more enjoyable adaptation. People just have to learn to look at books and movie that are based on them as different stories, If you just sulk and pout during the movie because they change parts, your not going to enjoy anything. I think people should give this movie a chance, without referring to the book, thats just going to ruin the experience. Anyways this movie was awesome and i'll watch it again and again, i hope there's a sequel.",Eragon
595,elranis,"as a film- not very bad; as ""eragon""...",5,7 January 2007,"As a film, it's not the worst thing I've seen. But it's not Eragon. 1)Arya looked like a real bitch (she had loved one of those elfs who were killed in the beginning BUT she flirted with Eragon) 2)She was blond, no pointed ears etc. 3)Eragon was too wise (in the book he had problems everywhere) 4)What happened to Horst? 5)Sloan was too nice person. 6)No insect would live on Razac! 7)Saphira was a mutant(she increased 5 meters in 5 minutes. Too fast) 8)Urgals were a race, not some kind of dirty humans 9)Gedwey ignaesia was weird. 10)Where was Yazuac? 11)Angela was a Character, not just a fortuneteller 12)Where was Solembum? 13)Where was Teirm? 14)Murtagh acted like a thief. 15)Brom's death was so pathetic 16)Durza did everything with his nails. 17)Saphira didn't know that she was able to transform stone into glass 18)Farthen Dur was weird 19)Struggle between Durza and Eragon was very different from this in the book 20)and so on...

596,nico_pico15,This movie is crud!!! Read the book it's way better,1,11 January 2007,This movie is so out of whack. The only thing that is the same for the book and the movie is that there is a dragon rider and his name is Eragon. They didn't even mention Joed and he is a key character in eldest. Plus Roran leaves he is one of the main characters in eldest. Also how are the Razac suppose to attack Carvahall if they are made by Durza when he is dead so there is another major mistake they made. I don't think that the people who made the movie Eragon even read eldest. It is not worth seeing in the movie theater. If you still want to see it better wait till it comes out on DVD and rent it. Its a waste of time to go and see. And a waste of money. So yea that is why I feel it is crud.,Eragon
597,melanieatkins_1,One of the worst,1,14 February 2007,I hope i never witness a sequel to this truly abysmal story. It seems like the whole film was put together in a couple of days. The script was dreadful and the acting not much better. When Jeremy Irons dies half way through he must of gave a sigh relief (at least he won't be in the sequel). The Film: A boy (Eragon) of 17 finds a dragon egg which hatches and becomes full sized in a day. The boy has special powers and rushes headfirst into everything without thinking but manages to survive everything thrown at him. None of the characters have any feeling felt towards them it's as if they are wooden characters. You don't really care what happens next. The finale is focused on a dragon fight with a raging battle fought beneath (which you don't see much of). The boy and his Dragon win (I don't know how) and it finishes as such that we will probably see the afore mentioned sequel. I say again what a terrible film trying to be Lord of the Rings but more like Bore of the rings.,Eragon
598,TheWhoFreak,Oh...My....God....,1,15 February 2007,"Okay. I will start off with the good. Rachel Wisze(Saphira), and the FX.The bad...(aka the whole movie) This God-awful piece of crap goes nothing like the book does. The characters are shown on screen nothing like they are pictured in Paolini's book. They are made to be as scary and as intimidating as possible, which in turn makes them about as frightening as Barney. I'm dead serious. Secondly, the storyline is all out of whack. Crucial elements in the story dropped or left out. Things moved to places where they make no sense at all. For example: Two of Saphira's crucial abilities are automatically honed to perfection. In the book they take at least 1-3 months to develop to where they can be used to their full potential. I mean really, does a baby dragon automatically have the ability to breathe fire, no. It takes months for such things to develop.The World would be a bit brighter if they hadn't made this movie.TheWhoRock never trust a bunny",Eragon
599,zacalsam,Eragon,1,16 February 2007,"This movie was absolutely horrid. I wasn't a huge fan of the book because of the plagiarism of the story. A orphan farm boy growing up on a farm with his uncle and then being dragged off by a ""crazy old wizard""- Sound familiar? I'm a Star Wars fan myself, so this storyline was very plagiarized in my opinion. Not to mention the Lord of the Rings stuff included.The special effects for this movie weren't all that great, and there was a grand total of 3 sets- Forest, Mountain, and a Field. Edward Speleers is a horrible actor.In my opinion, very horrible movie. Don't waste your money or your time. Though, if you do, prepare to have splitting sides afterwards because it's very easy to laugh at the most ""serious"" moments because of their unbelievability. I know I started laughing during some of them because the actors are horrible, so the performance is not believable at all.That's my opinion on Eragon- The worst movie I have ever seen, but great to compare to other movies to it to rate how bad a movie is.",Eragon
600,sedawi_2,"not like like the book , but still great",10,6 February 2007,"I think that 'eragon' was a really good book , i surprised to find that in the movie they have changed almost everything , they have deleted full chapters mix scenes together and invented things , but it haven't make the movie worst . no it haven't . the movie was even better . It begins with a really great scene , its the best opening scene in a movie , and it ends with great and wonderful end . I specially loved the evil witch he was awesome . at the end i really loved this movie and shortly ""eragon is my second favorite movie ever (the best is pirates 2)"" . go watch eragon even if you haven't read the book i am sure you will enjoy it",Eragon
601,LordHaart,Time troubles,4,12 February 2007,"I would say that Eragon is a nice movie, not too bad, not very good. But for its fantasy genre and great production, one awaits more than can be seen here. It may be caused by the superb Lord of the Rings Trilogy, because every fantasy movie is compared with it and no doubt that Eragon is no match to it. The biggest minus of this movie is that it is too short, the story is great and could have been told interestingly, but instead of it the movie runs out of every opportunity to tell something, because of the lack of time and the final ""lookback"" of the hero is a little bit funny, because he remembers something that happened 30 minutes ago in the movie (i talk about the death of Brom). All in all there are many problems with seeing the time-line in this movie - the heroes never rest and whole story is acted in few days. I don't know, maybe the authors just wanted to have some money from the cry for fantasy films.",Eragon
602,poor_irish_girl,Worth it? I think not.,1,26 February 2008,"If you are one of the many (and God, I hope there are many) that know how to read, and have read Eragon, you will most likely feel insulted. In fact, I, along with friends, have had more fun making fun of this idiotic attempt at a movie than we did watching it. The entire time I kept wondering; Did they even read the book? Is Paolini a sell-out looking for instant gratification (aka money) or did he just not have enough of a spine to tell them not to destroy his story? As far as following the book, this movie isn't worth anyone's time. If your favorite characters were...well, anyone besides Saphira, prepare to be severely disappointed.Now, on to its quality without comparing it to the book. Saphira was the best thing to it. The boys and girls who animated her did a wonderful job, and I hope they all go on to more wonderful projects. Rachael Weisz did a fantastic voice. Perfect acting she did, really. Too bad she was the only one. I'd expected more from Mr. Irons, and while I recommend you see most of the other movies he's in, I still advise you to avoid Eragon. You'll wonder at how quickly Eragon and Brom traverse vast expanses of desert...in five minutes - which is a good three minutes more than it took Saphira to grow up. You'll laugh at the the ridiculous acting and poor timing, but you'll cry when you realize that the acting is funnier that any ""good lines"" in the characters' dialogs. Not to mention, I recall hearing quite a few people say ""..that's it?"" when the credits started rolling.So, if you are looking for a good movie for your three year old who wouldn't care what you were showing him so long he can stare at that brightly lit television - by all means watch it. If you are looking for a good movie for yourself, and have at least more motor skills and brain functions than that three-year-old, DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME.",Eragon
603,christiangal_101,I was properly disappointed.,3,31 March 2007,"I went into this film with low expectations, and came out of it with nothing more. I didn't bother to watch it in the theaters; instead, I rented it to see how bad it really was. The movie was overall boring, except for the parts with Saphira the dragon. You saw hardly any development of the characters. It seemed like the director just threw together a bunch of random scenes and tried to make it into a movie. The script was laughable, especially the lines of Galbatorix. He didn't sound threatening; on the contrary, he sounded as though he were talking to mentally disabled people, what with his obvious and unimaginative statements as this: ""I am being challenged. I don't want to be challenged."" The movie was NOWHERE near the original storyline. For instance, where in the book did Saphira suddenly transform from a cute, baby dragon into a massive beast? My advice: don't even rent it. It's not worth your time. Read the books instead.",Eragon
604,hoppitgreenfrog,The director let this film down.,6,21 April 2007,"First of all, the performances in this film are good, to excellent.(Saphira's voice-over was fantastic) The costume design, the special effects, and the fight sequence's are all well choreographed.Ed Speleers made a good performance as Eragon, Jeremy Irons was excellent(He even made the cheesy lines less cheesy) and Garrett Hedlund was good, for the small part he played.However, the director chose to completely butcher the story, leaving cheesy lines, missing out important plot-points from the book, and rushing the film.Should this film had, say... 30-40 more minutes, a bit more grit(Such as more realistic fighting, this film was aimed to be a PG and there wasn't enough grittiness in it) and a better director, this film could have rivalled Lord of the Rings, if not, been better than it.Eldest(The sequel to Eragon) will be a very difficult film to make for whoever directs it because the story was so badly adapted, which goes to show why you never hire a special effects guy to direct.Shame on Stefen Fangmeier.",Eragon

It seemed to be more of a focus than the plot, which was just so so. Special effects and backdrop were incredible. It's tough to bring an animated character to life with a unique personality, but they definitely succeeded. I would have enjoyed seeing the plot developed a little more, with some expansion of the other characters as well. I would look forward to seeing the sequel, if it's filmed.

It's one of those movies where you're watching the clock (until the end time) more than the movie. Just bad. Who are the actors that appear to be important, but no explanation? How does Eragon receive his magical powers? Where did the director go to college (did he?). I hope there is a school for bad actors and bad directors.

The story has so many details and important points and the movie just skips them or puts them in the wrong place! For example, in the book Brom gets killed because the Ra'zakh throw a dagger at him. In the movie, he dies because he jumps in front of flying weapons thrown by Durza. Also in the book Saphira doesn't start breathing fire until the very end of the big fight. In the movie, she starts breathing fire at the very start. The Ra'zakhs were nothing like the Ra'zakhs in the book. The acting was no good, Especially Jhon Malkovoch's lines were horrible. I can't believe someone got paid to write that script. I was extremely disappointed with the movie, having loved the book and read it many times over.

Anyway, the movie is so off fro the book. Where were the Twins! And Roran's girlfriend! Those are two main things in the second book! That basically is the main thing in the next book! If they make a second movie, they better have like a before thing that shows and tells about Katrina and the Twins, otherwise, Eldest will SUCK!! And, they better get a different director!

Also how they messed up how Brom died made me want to leave from seeing one of my favourite books butchered. Also the Razac are not suppose to die. Thats a huge part of the 2nd book. Finally, when Eragon didn't suffer from his slash on the back and never had his vision I was so mad at the theater for allowing murder of a book in their theater.

The only real good acting was by Jeremy Irons (Brom). The movie cuts out about 70% of the book, and it's only around 90 minutes or so. Someone should make a remake of Eragon and make it a lot longer, with more intelligent dialog and much more character interaction. That's what makes a good movie.If you've read the book, see the movie, but beware, you probably imagined the everything looking completely different than it does in the movie. For example, Eragon shouldn't have blond hair or have a ""pretty-boy"" face like Edward Speleers, and King Galbatorix shouldn't be bald.

My son adored the book, which is the first part of a trilogy, but was deeply disappointed of the movie. I guess that after three fantastic Lord of the Rings motion pictures, one's threshold has reached saturation. But I'll be honest with you, this film does stink. It's as if it was made and edited back in the early 80s--jumpy plot, horrible special effects and actors who should go back to school and study the basics again. Even in the 80s there were much better fantasy films, like for instance The Never Ending Story or Dune (or even The Highlander) where you could be immersed easily by the scenery and be swept away to another colorful world.

616,vinnybball14,Truly a Terrible Rendition of an Interesting Book,1,1 September 2008,"First off, I read Eragon before seeing this... thing. As someone who read the book beforehand and thoroughly remembered it, this was an absolutely awful movie. They changed just about EVERYTHING in this movie. I understand of course that some things must be changed for time and whatnot, that is obvious, but this movie is so bad it is quite hilarious at times. Here's a quick example: If you read the book you know that an Urgal is a large humanoid (but not human) creature with horns. I think they are green but I can't quite remember. Anyways, in the movie they are just big, dirty, barbaric looking men! I couldn't believe it when I saw them, it was just too ridiculous to not laugh. Whenever Eragon uses the Brisngr spell (however you spell it) to create fire, it is blue in the movie... No I don't understand that either. Also, when Saphira and Eragon finally get to the base of the Varden, it's like they somehow slipped into Persia... Welcome to Alladin Eragon. They way people dressed and the way everything looked, that's what it made me think of. The final climactic battle is so stupid that I really wanted to walk out that instant (but my ride was sitting next to me and had no intention of leaving). The funniest terrible part of all was probably how Saphira flies for the first time and suddenly... BOOM! She transforms into a full grown dragon! That way the director cleverly (sarcasm) avoids Saphira having to grow throughout a film that is much shorter than the book. Of course, I'm not sure if Saphira is suddenly going to start growing again in the next movie, or if she'll go through some other weird transformation to start that sucker off. If you've never read the book, I still say don't see this movie. Maybe if you have absolutely nothing else to do. If you HAVE read the book, then by all means avoid this monstrosity because it will only make you really angry.",Eragon
617,tony_adlington,Never watch,1,30 August 2008,"I hated, nay LOATHED this movie. And before anyone who thought it was good argues I need to bring up a few ""mistakes"" (more like obvious idiocy) that seemed to flow through the movie.The first and most irritating of all was the mistake with Eragon's age. Now in the book, Eragon is clear stated as being 15 years of age. However in the movie Brom actually asks Eragon how old he is and I quote Brom: How old are you, 15? 16? Eragon: No I'm 17 actuallyThe reason this particular mistake is annoying me more than all the others is because I cannot for the life of me understand why it was made. Not only was there no reason for them to mention his age at all, it didn't save time or costs, which are the usual reasons for mistakes being made in book-movies. Other mistakes that didn't save time or money include Arya's clothing (her wearing beige and a skirt instead of plain black leather pants and shirt) and Angela the Herbalist/witch (Why oh why did they make her like that. Would it have hurt them to keep her the way she was intended, witty, funny and wise instead of irritating and sort of like a gypsy-fortune teller from a carnival?) and ""Snowfire"" being brown (how much more could a white horse have costed). Another idiotic annoyance is one that actually cost them more than if they had left it. I talk of course, the instance where they include Galbatorix in the movie when we never physically see him in the books. This irritates me as he seemed like a cliché villain and it made him lose all of his mysticism, which as there's have been 2 books and we have not yet seen him, was the main thing that made Galbatorix so terrifyingTo be honest i would have preferred it if the CGI had terrible but the budget had been spent on making the movie true the story instead of plaguing what could have been a fantastic movie with pointless mistakes.I could (and have on previous occasions) rant about this movie for hours. So I now leave you with a campaign to have the movie remade, but someone who listens to the books and stays true to them to give us a way to enjoy this marvellous story they way it was written, instead of watching Stefanm Fangmeier's crude adaptation",Eragon

I have to agree with the many comments out there that are negative about this movie. I am very glad I never wasted my money and just waited to borrow it from the library. The movie seems like the screenwriter ate the book then just took the pieces that were not digested and used them (sorry for the grotesque way of looking at it.) The book was so much better! What I can't believe is that Paolini actually let them tear his work up like that. I am an aspiring writer trying to get to a point where I can be published one day and this movie sucked compared to the book. I think I missed the part in the book that described elf ears as being normal looking... oh wait it didn't say that. Anyway, they do leave out characters that should have been in there, they way they did cities isn't at all like it was described in the books, and yes it seems it is centered around Eragon and Brom. There is so much I could say against this movie it would take me hours to type. Yes, all movies leave things out or change things, but this book was hacked up bad enough that now it is just sad (the movie not the book) Please someone out there take this book, read it and make a longer better movie out of it keep Irons, Malkovich and Weisz, and get other actors for the other characters. And please whatever you do Peter Buchman and Stefen Fangmeier PLEASE DON'T try to make a second one. Sad Sad Sad.... There is a reason the DVD I borrowed has the sticker ""Children"" on it.

The characters were all great with the exception of the evil SHADE, who looked much like any other evil sorcerer from other movies. Not sure why they have to look like they can't use a washcloth and wash their face! The dragon animations were very well done. The main character was well cast, if not a little too good looking for the plot. Had one scene where is is cleaning up, and a girl walks in on him as he is bare chested. Only reason for the scene seems to be to give everyone a chance to look at his well defined bod. I think the context of the story was good, but a lot of stuff was obviously condensed to make the movie, and some parts could have used more explanation, I thought for a long time that the girl at the beginning, who looked quite older than the star, was possibly his mother.

Wanted to know just how the evil king and his dragon would be defeated. People are just to hard on some of our movies these days. Look to be entertained, and stop picking them to death. There is not a movie out there that can stand up to opinions that are set on finding the bad in them. When there is so much good qualities about them. Most of the time I judge weather or not I go see a movie in the theaters. If the critics don't like it then it is most likely a good show. The more they like it the less the chances I will see it ever. That rule of thumb works very well for me.",Eragon

Childish dialogs, extremely fast pacing, no character development. The whole thing gave me a sense of hurry.The acting is not so good. Only Irons shines, while John Malkovich is really wasted having about only 10 minutes screen time.The battles are not as impressive as they could be and if someone expects something similar with LOTR, he'll be disappointed. Finally, the effects or simply the dragon are quite good but they aren't enough to make a good movie.Conclusion: Wait for the DVD release...",Eragon
623,Mojo881,A terrible adaptation of a great book,1,28 June 2009,"I was really excited when I heard they were making a movie out of Christopher Paolini's book, but after seeing it I was incredibly disappointed. They hurried the movie along with no regard for what was being omitted. The acting, for the most part, was terrible - the only exceptions being Rachel Weiz as the voice of Saphira, and Jeremy Irons as Brom. The script deviated so far from the book that it is hard to call this the same story. We never see Eragon's intense training under Brom, we never hear all of Angela's prophecy, or meet Solembum the werecat... The major characters of the book are hardly in the movie. Even the final battle for Farthen Dur is entirely changed from Paolini's version.The one thing that irks me the most, however, is that the movie fails to capture the most important aspect of the story; Eragon's ever growing bond with Saphira. Sure, the movie had a dramatic scene at the end - but it feels hollow because the movie doesn't truly capture their growth as rider and dragon. If you want the true experience, skip this and read the book.",Eragon

625,roblox_many,Adding insult to injury,1,19 September 2009,"This movie was another case of Hollywood trying to make a family hit instead of a good film. I watched the movie before reading the book and initially thought it a good movie. However, upon reading the book, I realized just how bad the movie was. Major characters, locations, and events were left out completely or built into other scenes. And the major characters that were in the movie had major alterations to them. One of the most glaring flaws was Arya's ears, which were not pointed like an elf's. If there was a good part to the movie, it was Saphira. The actor chosen to do her voice was perfect for the role. Also, the animation for her was well done and realistic. However, even she was a disappointment in a way. Her character design majorly deviated from the book. In closing, Eragon is a movie you should only watch if you have not read the book and is unlikely to have a sequel.",Eragon

628,spencer_phillips,This movie is not worth your time to view if you have read the books.,1,14 December 2009,If I could give it any lower then one out of ten I would. This movie is full of plot holes and doesn't follow the book at all. The only part the movie really follows is that Eragon is a dragon rider. In the book Brom is not killed by Durza saving Eragon's life but is killed by the Ra'zac. Murtagh is not held prisoner during the battle Ajihad releases him because he wants all the help he can get in the battle. If i had written the books that are supposed to coincide with this movie I would be deeply saddened that the producers of this movie decided to hire a hack of a director that had not read the book (as shown by this movie) to then allow him to destroy what would have been a good movie if it was as a whole not full of holes. The next movie that would be made would be eldest but if Christopher Paolini has yet to sell the rights to it i would not for the simple fact that in order to make a second movie they would have to completely destroy the original book.,Eragon
629,Tommiegirlxxx,No,2,29 January 2011,"OK, here's the thing, the book? AMAZING! Great plot, writing, character development, etc. But this movie was just...SO bad.... my liking of the book was actually brought down a couple notches. The redeeming qualities of this feature are the special effects, Jerome Irons, and John Malkovich. But Irons dies without as much elaboration as one would've hoped on his character because he's only in for, like, 30 minutes. And, though they keep showing small scenes of Malkovich, all in all, he's got about 10 minutes worth of screen time. Finally, why sacrifice good writing for special effects? Yes, they're important, but when the rest of the movie flows, the special effects are less important to engrossing one's audience into their project. This movie had a lot of potential, but it was ruined, and the story wasn't even followed through enough to relate to the book it was based off of. I swear, after watching this, all I thought was, ""I hope this wasn't ACTUALLY Christopher Paloni's vision of the movie version of the book he's put so much time and thought into.""",Eragon

The dragon is fantastic, story is good, however, if you've read the book keep an open mind. When you translate a book to film you lose some of the details unless you make the movie 14hrs long. I saw the movie then read the book and thought the director did a fair job putting it up. I look forward to seeing the next one ""Eldest"" if it does in fact get off the ground. The first movie leaves the viewers on the edge of what happens next though does give a good conclusion for book one.

632,Claire_Catspaw,A little reminder,5,26 July 2010,"Honestly, I haven't taken the time to see through all the reviews here (and there's over a thousand of them here so you'll forgive my conclusions) but the general opinion about Eragon seems to be negative. I'm going to try to offer a new perspective here.To start with, let's not fool ourselves by denying the simple fact that Eragon, truthfully, is a tragic and shameless rip-off of Lord of The Rings. Come on, we can all see the resemblance and draw parallels. That said, one really cannot expect a rip-off to be made into something decent to watch. Therefore, we should not blame the actors. I'd say they had nothing decent to work with anyway. Why they accepted these roles, is truly their business, sure they had good reasons. I say the scapegoat would be the awful script (but keep in mind, nothing good comes out of a rip-off) and the bad directing because the actors themselves were true eye candies. Ed Speleers as a fresh face on the screen was a nice surprise, I liked him though this film did not flatter his potential at all. I loved Jeremy Irons, always good to see him and Sienna Guillory is a very sweet girl.So for all those who say the only good part of the film was the dragon (and I'm not totally disagreeing, would only specify that the dragon character was most convincingly acted out), I would remind the origin of the Eragon story itself. A rip-off. Remember that. Please, let's not blame those beautiful talented actors: you can have all the talent in the world but if you are given nothing but load of junk to work with, what can you expect of the outcome?... Think about it.",Eragon

If you didn't read the book, and are a fan of raw, worthless, brainless, without even the slightest touch of useful speeches, this film might not even be enough to distract you...And if you read the book, then don't even bother looking at it. When you look at the film, you can't even find a single aspect of the book! Eragon is described as a stupid, impulsive boy (which is but a mere part of his nature)And don't even speak about the other characters. For instance, Angela is normally a useful woman, of prophecies and is surrounded by a veil of mystery. Here, you just ask yourself : why the hell did they but a weirdo speaking to Eragon?I won't go any further than that, there is no need to.

634,dieselhead89,Not worth the disc it's recorded on,2,5 September 2011,"I originally viewed this movie with no prior history in the series, and I absolutely LOVED it. It was adventurous, exciting, and it had this way of sorta dragging you into a new world. Then, my interest being piqued, I read the book. I was astounded at the horrible quality of movie-making the film adaptation displayed. By comparison, the movie is atrocious. It's poorly written, poorly acted (mostly), and the storyline is so withdrawn from the book I'm surprised they kept the same title. The actors did a good job for what they were given to work with, I'll give them that, but the inaccuracies are too numerous to mention here. The big ones, I can't help but mention though. Why in the wide world of Hollywood did they give Saphira feathers?! It is very clearly pointed out in the book on numerous occasions that Saphira's wings are thin membranes of skin, NOT feathers, and this does play into the story in places. Were the powers-that-be trying to make a reference to evolution (which I, personally, find highly offensive), or were they just smoking something illegal? And Saphira's growth from hatchling to adult was so exaggerated with no sense of time or character growth, just kind of a *poof* ""There you go!""...completely un-satisfying. Next, the characters of Brom and Arya were nothing like the book described them, taking nothing away from Jeremy and Sienna's performances; but in all fairness, at least they were actually in the movie. Main character's such as: Hrothgar, Orik, Jormunder, the citizens of Carvahall, and numerous others that had vital roles to play as sub-characters were not even featured or named. On the other hand, Galbatorix was never even featured in the first book, and yet he has a full, speaking role in the movie. The events surrounding Brom's death, Eragon's departure at the end, and the relationship between Eragon and Arya aren't even close to actual events. The Urgals, were embarrassing. The description given is a brutish humanoid that stands over 6 feet tall, has a grayish hide, ram-like horns, and is extremely muscular; NOT an average Joe made to look like a caveman with face paint and some fake teeth. I could ramble on and on about all the vast differences (and they are vast), but I shall wrap this up with a glimmer of good. The very few redeeming qualities about this movie would have to be the voice part played by Rachel Weisz, which was outstanding, and the special effects which, weren't great, but weren't awful. Overall I would never EVER recommend this movie to anyone who has ever read or plans to read the book. Save yourself the 104 minutes. My recommendation: pick up the book, immerse yourself in the world of Alagaesia as Christopher Paolini intended, and I personally guarantee you will be so much more satisfied.",Eragon

The book was relatively decent so I assumed the movie form would be fun to watch as well. The movie was nothing like the book. The script writer for this movie added and cut scenes where he saw fit. Omitted parts of the story that would have added to the movie and made it make more sense. The movie seemed full of cheesy one liners. The fighting scenes were terrible, and some of the key fighting scenes seemed to be made from pieces of other movies. If you read the book and enjoyed it then don't waste your time with the movie.

I don't care how fantastic the visual effects are, NOBODY CARES if you don't develop interesting characters, and 90 minutes is just enough time to make a slapstick comedy funny, but certainly not enough time to develop a 500+ fantasy book with an entire world of characters and story lines. This film is lazy, boring, and unimaginative. The cinematography is carbon-copied from the LOTR trilogy, Howard Shore should sue the film composer for plagiarism (except he did a poor job of it), and let's hope that Stefen Fangmeir decided to go back to what he know best - supervising visual effects - because he certainly can't supervise (i.e. direct) living, breathing human beings.

Many of these are in fact caused by differentiating from a wonderful source material. 1) My only problem with the special effects, the addition of feathers to Saphira's design 2) Writing that is very nearly debilitating to the laudable efforts of Jeremy Irons & Rachel Weisz. 3) Not enough of the very enjoyable John Malkovich, who is spot on for how I imagined Galbatorix to look like. 4) The fact that we see next to no development of Eragon's magical prowess, outside of him first using it, failing to heal a mortally wounded Brom, and then somehow being capable of healing an enormous neck wound Saphira acquires during the battle of Farthen Dur. 5) Speleers and Guillory are given far too much screen time, as well as a romance that feels insincere or, dare I say it, even forced at times.There are legion others I could point out, but I am possessed of neither the time nor the motivation to point them all out. Just leave it at the fact that this movie could have been a decent adaptation, if not for a few very stupid mistakes.",Eragon
639,luckdragon82,"The producer, writers and especially the director should never work in Hollywood again!",2,10 March 2011,"This has a few spoilers (as if it matters)The best acting in this movie came from Rachel Weisz playing the voice of Sephera. The next best acting came from Jeremy Irons playing as Brom. The only scene in the movie that was actually good and a testament to the book was Brom's funeral scene (although Aria was in no way part of that in the book).The director of this movie should never direct another movie ever again and be banned from doing so. The same goes with the producer and the writers. The lead actor (as if) playing Eragon was a sorry excuse for the part with almost no talent. Broms character was played as best as could be given the shoddy script. Sephera had the best acting, although it was only a voice-over.There are too many points of indiscretion to point out in this movie, so I'll hit on the most noteworthy. As I said above, Brom's funeral scene is the best credit they could give to the book. I was fervently upset with the fact the elves had no pointed ears. Who makes an elf without pointed ears!? To heck with the directors ""artistic vision"" (you can hear him talk all about it in the DVD extras). Secondly, the Ergles are described as NOT HUMAN! It's quite obvious how they look by the book's excellent descriptions.I could go on with just how horrible this movie was and what a farce it made of Christopher Polini's vision in the book, but I could write a book on it. Overall, if somebody decides to produce a ""reboot"" of Eragon, I pray they bring back Rachel Weisz for she had the best acting and voice for Sephera. They should also recall Jeremy Irons as Brom because, as a supporting actor, his acting far exceeded that of the lead actor. Also, they should have Lucas Arts do the visual and audio, for there were many issues in the movie. Secondly, have somebody with actual directing skills on the remake like Steven Spielberg or someone equally qualified (although I consider him at the highest point in directing).In all, this movie isn't even worth illegally downloading.

The CGI is great, the cast is actually quite decent, and it really looks like the team that brought us this, wanted the movie do be bad.

They did put the money in the effects, and some of the acting was fine, like Jeremy Irons and Rachel Weisz, but you get the feeling that not enough effort was put into the writing and not enough effort was made by the young actors.

I know many criticize the acting, and, while none of it was stellar, I think the biggest flaw in the movie was the script, who knows how well these actors could have done if the screenwriters had read the book instead of the Cliff's Notes! There were so many major plot points and characters left out and the few they kept were so hurried or altered they were not interesting.It also greatly annoyed me that they eliminated EVERY plot point from the book that leads to Eldest, yet they bother to spoil the little surprises such as Arya's nobility which we don't discover until well into book 2! Also, if they were to make a movie of Eldest (which I doubt since this was fairly weak in the domestic box office) they have no way to set up the big finale, because apparently in movie world, everyone involved ""knows"" the instant an egg hatches, so no surprises on the battlefield! My problems with the story aside, it was still a below average film. The story was very hurried, characters were introduced so fast and thrown into battle so you never get to know them, and information was just thrown at the viewer, instead of creatively revealed.

645,s_imdb-28,A spectacle of a movie,10,17 December 2006,"Film of the Week - Critic by Eric German 17-12-06 BREATHING NEW FIRE INTO A DRAGON FANTASY ERAGON (KRS/Pg, *** and a half) puts paid to all those nasty rumours about dragon slayers and damsels in distress.The setting is the land of Alagesia and the time is one where dragons were man's friend and the elite breed of dragon riders were the country's heroes. All that changed with the oppression inflicted by the corrupt king Galbatorix (Jon Malkovich) and his evil wizard, Durza (John Carlyle).Another change is ushered in when Eragon (Edward Speleers), an orphan farm boy, finds a dragon egg which soon yields a baby dragon that grows into the adult flying and fire-breathing Saphira.Aided by the aged but wise former warrior Brom (Jeremy Irons), Eragon becomes a dragon rider and the good fight is on.Eragon was adapted from the best selling novel written by 15-year-old Christopher Paolini. I haven't read the book but the film lacks the sophistication and strong plots of fantasy films based on the work of adult authors.On the other hand it has a child-like sense of wonder that few adult authors can conjure up so effectively.That sense of wonder begins when the egg cracks open and the baby dragon takes her first wobbly steps. Director Stefen Fangmeier sustains that sense throughout the film, making it a superior boy's fantasy come to life on screen.This is Fangmeier's debut. Before he was a visual effects supervisor and his expertise shows because the perfectly rendered visual effects are woven seamlessly with the live action And he takes CG special effects to a higher level because Saphira's facial imagery conveys thoughts and feelings. Her movements, which frequently involve high speed 'stunts,' are executed in a perfectly smooth way.She communicates telepathically with Eragon and Rachel Weisz has done a superb job in creating Saphira's vocal characterisation.The casting has its pros and cons. Ed Speleers has the right looks and the right build for the role but, apart from the scenes he shares with Saphira, he's no actor.Brief but expressive Jeremy Irons puts a lot of meat on the bare bones of the dialogue but when you see an actor of that calibre delivering lines which are basically a crash course in dragon riding it creates a conflict.Had the film been a bit darker, it would have engaged my interest on more than a visual level. As it is, the mythology seldom springs to life.Fortunately, Sienna Guillory's performance as the captive warrior Arya gives the film what mythology and mystery it has. Her role is very brief but she's so expressive that I could almost feel the anxiety and fear that Arya was going through.The climax is the big and very spectacular battle on the ground and the mid-air struggle as Eragon and Saphira try to overcome the sorcerer's power.Although its appeal is primarily for children and younger teens, Eragon is a thrilling fantasy adventure and a visual effects extravaganza made with skill and taste.",Eragon

Eragon is hardly a film that I could classify as being the most terrible film I have seen. Yes the story is very lord of the rings and I wouldn't be surprised if the film makers took inspiration from the lord of the rings but it is not the worst film I have seen. The story is very much in the typical hero quest genre, where a young hero sets out on a journey, aided by an older wiser mentor.

648,c-dongjia,It was.... alright.,6,24 July 2012,"I just finished reading the tetralogy, and decided that I missed the series too much, so I finally decided to watch the movie. I have avoided the movie all these years because of bad reviews, widespread claims that it did not hold on par to the books, and simply, the fact that I did not want what I've imagined all the characters and places to change due to the movie.I tried extremely hard to be open-minded, and rate this movie from an un-biased point of view, and even tried imagining my reaction to this if I hadn't read the book. Luckily, it's been a while since I first read Eragon... 9 years to be exact, so besides retaining the main plot of the book, I have forgotten the majority of the small details. That really helped, or I'm afraid I might have been a lot harsher than I am at this moment.In conclusion, the movie.. was alright. Reading other people's reviews about how it diverged far from the books and how it heeded no justice to Paolini's masterpiece, I came in with pretty low expectations. I must say that I half-agree with this. So let me start off with some problems I had with the movie. The acting was not amazing. Ed Speelers (Eragon) definitely disappointed me as the lead actor; his facial expressions were unconvincing and even fake-looking at times. His speech was passable, but emotion-less. Sienna Guillory (Arya) and Gary Hedlund (Murtagh) were alright, not great. Jeremy Irons (Brom) was a decent actor; however, his character lacked development, and it was hard to feel anything for him when he died. That being said, I was bawling while reading the book during the scene Brom died. That scene also alerted me to the poor choice of character development on all sides; however, I half-blame Paolini for this, too, since he failed to bring about adequate character development in his books as well.As for the speed of the movie, I agree with the other comments. Way too fast. Saphira growing up in the span of a second, Eragon being able to learn magic simply by listening Brom talk about it for a couple of seconds, and the anti-climactic death of the Shade, Durza. These fast-forward episodes really take away the magical component that Paolini tried so hard to construct into his reader's minds. There was no suspense, no fist-clenching scenes, no climactic sense of excitement. Overall, the storyline was just captivating enough for me to want to finish the movie, but definitely did not make me yearn for more.As many have said, the voicing of Saphira is what carried the movie, and I do think that she was the strongest character in the movie. Additionally, the special effects surrounding her movement and flight were stunning. Overall, the special effects were great, and the setting was beautiful, so I have to give the director at least this much credit. Additionally, Durza was quite terrifying, although Galbatorix seemed a bit of a joke.As I have said, it is an alright movie. It is aesthetically pleasing, and the dragon Saphira is absolutely astounding. However, the characters themselves in terms of portrayal and development need work.",Eragon
649,forallthecows,A pale shadow of the book,3,14 December 2006,"I know what has been said about Paolini's immature writing style; personally, I read fantasy extensively and his books did not stand out in any way as being immature. It was well plotted, the characters had reasons for doing what they did and behaving in the way they did and these were all explained using narrative or action in the book; suspension of disbelief did the rest.I went to the movie expecting a reasonable attempt to transfer to the screen, the happenings in the book, which cover a relatively short time in Eragon's life; I was completely disappointed. The presence of Malkovich and Irons was welcome and they did a good job with what they were given, but therein lies the problem; they were given next to nothing at all.The plot was highly simplified from that of the book and changed into a lacklustre and hurried journey from one set piece from the book to another, leaving out most of the plot and character development that gives it all a reason. Some key elements of the storyline have changed or been omitted that are major foundations of Paolini's second book to the extent that I cannot see how the story from the second book can follow from this without the same shallow treatment.I will not be buying the DVD and I will take a lot of persuading to go and watch the sequel if it comes out. Overall, it was an expensive missed opportunity for the film makers and a huge disappointment.",Eragon
650,billkubert,Skip it.,1,20 December 2006,"Really Bad. If you read the books, do yourself a favor and don't put yourself through the agony of sitting through this travesty. The story line (which skips about 70% of the original story line) wanders miles from the novel. Except for Rachel Weisz's great voice over work for the dragon (which is the best acting this film has) the acting from the rest of the actors is just above high school play level. What were Jeremy and John thinking in taking these roles? The special effects are decent but that's it and the sets are cheesy Save your cash and wait for the third novel.Let's hope they will not be a sequel.",Eragon
651,cliph55,simply clean book ruined by the movie and the director,2,17 December 2006,"I was expecting the movie to leave out portions of the book. I did not expect the ""director"", Stefen Fangmeier to change the book. All in all the director ruined this movie...I have been waiting for this movie for 2 years. I had great expectations and when I left the theater I felt cheated and disappointed. I expected more from him. The entire movie jumps around and I often wondered how they got from point A to point B. There were people who had not read this book in the audience and in the lobby they were wondering about the characters and the plot. They also felt as if something was missing. The movie was only 104 minutes long...they could have made it longer and resolved some of the storyline problems.The following are plot ""problems"" whereby the director changed the story line to fit his needs, and these are just a few...if this is ""poetic license"" he's not a poet and he doesn't have a license. 1. Roran tells Eragon he is leaving the farm and then tells his father not the other way around and Eragon is extremely unhappy that he is being left on the farm. 2. Eragon ""discovers"" Saphira is a female when he is trying to name her...he does not know she is a female until this happens. 3. Eragon ""names"" Saphira...she doesn't tell him her name. 4. What happened to Katrina? She wasn't even in the story and she was a major player relative to Roran. 5. What happened to Roran? Where did he go? 6. The director makes it look like Eragon and Arya will be lovers and she wants him to be a Dragon rider not her friend/lover forever. Eragon is smitten with her, not the other way around. 7. in the final battle, Durza wounds Eragon horribly across his back...this was completely left out. 8. The Ergols were not just big fat bad bald men...they were similar to Orcs from LOTR. 9. Eragon doesn't just instinctively know magic...Brom has to teach him this and everything else before he dies. 10. Saphira doesn't just grow from 10 pounds to 1000 pounds in one single flight...thats a crock all by itself.2 thumbs down for this flick.",Eragon
652,Nissi_Nirvani,Well it is pretty...,3,16 December 2006,"But seriously, when did cliffnotes start doing movies? The character development was all but non-existent. The plot is severely weakened by huge gaping holes in the story. If you've read the book, forget about it beforehand or it will hurt. Huge portions of the book are MIA and it shows.Saphira is gorgeously rendered, the special effects are lovely... but these should be the icing on the cake.The only thing that saves this movie from total flop status is the actors try very hard with what they were given. But when transferring a 500+ page book to the silver screen, giving it only an hour and forty minutes makes for a very sad little movie indeed.",Eragon
653,Scaith,Start of something good?,6,12 December 2006,"Saw this movie last night. My reenactment club was asked to provide some people in armour and to put on a fight before the movie. That part was fun and we got to see the movie as our fee.OK, firstly I went in to this movie cold. I didn't read any book or watch trailers. I had a peek at the stills from the movie on IMDb just before getting ready, to get some idea of what the armour and weapons were like so that I knew what to wear out of my own gear.I found the movie to be engaging. The special effects were relatively seamless and the acting of the lead was like someone who was rapidly thrown unknowing in to the deep end, just like his character in the movie, so that works. Brom and the king fitted their roles well as those two would be expected to.Having gone in cold to this world, I would have liked more background information as to what had gone before, but, in keeping with Eragon's character, we are left to find out the stories back ground at the same time as him.Though this movie is a little thin, I think that it is only the first installment and that the actors will grow in to their roles and that the story will be fleshed out.Taken as a one off movie, it's a fun watch, but it isn't great. If it is the start of a series of movies, it's a great start. I would suggest that people seeing this movie keep in mind that it is only the start of a story and support it so that the studio's don't drop any future parts. Now I'm going to search around and see if there are plans for followup movies. thanks all Derek",Eragon
654,blutch-1,a somewhat refreshing story,9,1 January 2007,"Although The story is on some point some what predictable. Eragon first movie of 3 good start off. The key character is being played quite well although in my personal opinion he needs to grow in his roll. the dragons are spectacular a well done job in that department. Also I would like to add that it is amazing that the story is not being rushed in one film a 90 minutes. and further more my complements that the film is not being forced in loads of battles. I am looking forward to the next film. in one sentence this film: A story written by a 15year old, incredible being shown on screen. some parts could be related to other films but nevertheless absolutely worth while watching. regards, blutch - the Netherlands",Eragon
655,redflamez25,Could have been great...,4,20 December 2006,"I went to this movie with an open mind...I figured the previews didn't look too bad and hey, I did like the book. However I came out of the theater for the most part disappointed. #1 I don't really think that the casting did the story justice(except for Rachel as Saphira) #2 I thought some of the lines were just downright hilarious. Some of this movie was so campy and..I think forced is the word I'm looking for.. that I just didn't believe that the world the movie was supposed to be creating was real. However, I thought the graphics were pretty decent and the music score fairly well done. If you want an epic, rent LoTR. If you want to see wizards, rent Harry Potter. This is a good movie to rent on a rainy day, but not worth the $7 movie ticket.",Eragon
656,carnavalbarker,What a waste.,1,31 March 2007,"For a 500 page book I was expecting this movie to be at least 3 hours long, but it lasted approximately 1 hour and 39 minutes. There were numerous parts in the book of things that happened before Saphira hatched. Eragon also had much more training from Broom before he went and rescued the damsel in distress from Durza's castle but it seems to me that the makers of the film did not think that the fans of the book would catch that. Rachel Weisz as the voice of Saphira and Jerrmy irons as Broom were the only actors who seem like they cared about their performances while the special effects lack a certain charm.Obviously this movie needed much more work before it hit theaters",Eragon
657,albion-10,"I expected you to be - well, more...",1,27 December 2006,"The quote of the Shade is very well fitting to the whole movie. At the beginning I was really nerved by the commentaries of Jeremy Irons as storyteller, and hoped it would get better. Well, I think I hoped to much. I was quite surprised when I saw the first quarter of an hour and had difficulties to find a trace of the book. But saying ""Well, it's like Troy - don't expect to see the story written in the book"" I hoped the movie would get better. Again I got disappointed. The actors were not acting was not even standard (even John Malkovich's performance was sub zero), the story was adapted as loveless as possible, the characters were racing through the scenes in a speed their evolution was not really viewable (or intended, I fear...) and the story was really... stupid... Interesting and important characters were missing, important scenes were missing, people not intended to appear appeared... Well, maybe it would have been better if a 16 year old boy had made this movie, I think he has more talent then the writer of the script, the director and the actors. I gave 3 stars because the animations and the costumes were nice, but the movie was as heartless as possible. The story in the book was nice (not high literature, but nice) and hold stuff for a good movie, but the movie-maker blow it. I hope there will be no second part, unless they change cast and crew and make a film after the book, not loosely inspired by it...",Eragon
658,bereliefhebber,Liked this so much when I was younger,7,3 October 2015,"I enjoyed this film so much when it first came out. I never ready the books, but I just loved the idea and some of the scenes were so cool back then. I still like the movie, partially because of nostalgic reasons and partially because it's still entertaining to me.Sure, the acting is a little choppy at moments, but the special effects are solid and Saphira is just awesome. I don't think it deserves the amount of criticism it's getting. Movies adapted from books or series rarely stick to the source material, mostly because they've got a certain time frame to work with. I've been waiting for a sequel for years and I still think Eragon should get one. Imagine how much they can improve things after all these years and with double the potential budget!",Eragon
659,albinonightfury,"Shocking acting, predictable and cliché",4,8 February 2015,"It's sad that the only good performance was from the dragon, Saphira. I didn't even bother to pay too much attention but the main female character whose name escapes me had the most diabolical acting skills I've ever seen. Her character was shallow, classic damsel-in- distress. That also goes for the main character, being a classic knight-in-shining-armour. Then as expected, the story was classic cliché hero-saves-girl-and-kills-villain, happy ending sort of thing. Ed Speelers' acting was only slightly better than the girl's. Literally the only praise I can give this film is the special effects and animation. The flight sequences were the only parts that entertained me and the dragon had more expressions perfectly animated than all of the actual actors put together, minus Jeremy Irons and John Malkovitch. Even though Malkovitch had the unfortunate fate of playing a cliché, cringe- worthy villain. The story was hugely boring, the soundtrack forgettable, the script predictable and the whole thing just felt like a failed attempt at some sort of Lord of the Rings-esque reboot. Don't recommend in the slightest.",Eragon

The story was good, but nothing seemed to be developed, plot-wise. I've never read the book, but it seemed as though the film writers tried to put all the information from the book into the movie and by doing so kept the movie from being as truly great as it could have been.I was also surprised by the acting of John Malkovich. This usually amazing actor seemed rather unconvincing. His acting was a bit dead with the only power he seemed to try to give to his lines was to speak with extreme emphasis on most lines. Sadly, by giving emphasis to most lines, the performance seemed a bit dead.Despite these two disappointing factors, I enjoyed the movie overall. Edward Speleers had a wonderful performance, and I was especially impressed by the performance of Jeremy Irons.",Eragon
662,ultrasroma1975,Childish movie and lame story.,3,7 January 2007,"I haven't read the book of Christopher Paolini and came to see the movie not expecting another masterpiece as LOTR, but at least some good entertainment. Boy, I couldn't be far from the truth.First of all the the main actor playing Eragon is really one of the worst actor I ever seen. Fron the onset, I felt I disliked him, with his stupid childish smile worsened by the kind of white teeth/trendy hairstyle which looked so fake in a fantasy movie. I so much despised him that towards the end of the movie, when he dismounted off the dragon,smiling in his idiotic way at the princess, who by the way looked like a fashion model, I hoped something bad would have befallen him, but of course nothing happened.The tale was so predictable and unoriginal (LOTR story and also Peter Jackson's direction rip-off, see for yourself the helicopter shots) that I had the distinct impression the whole production was rushed for lack of budget. No wonder people are telling that the book was butchered by the movie. This is exactly the kind of movie that would have benefited from 30 more minutes to explain the story and develop more the characters, who, apart from the dragon (good CGI and the only redeemable part of the movie), are not moving at all. All in all, I do hope they won't do a sequel of this movie. One thing is for sure, I wouldn't even want to see for free, let alone spend money in a theater.",Eragon

The bond between Eragon and his cousin for one as well as the connection with the fortune teller. I can only hope that they do make the sequel (how can they not?) and that many of these lost parts brought back into the film. But all in all it was a very enjoyable movie and did so with out sex. How can that be? A good movie and one that had no sex? There may be hope for future films yet. And the gore was absent as well but yet I heard many a youngster in the audience get scared,as well as adults. So see Hollywood,a good film is possible if the story is right and the actors are also. Well done to all.",Eragon

If I were the author of the book I would be sitting alone weeping over the travesty of this movie. How could this man have allowed this movie to be made. The director should never walk onto a movie set again, the screenwriters should be punished, and the actors disgraced.90% of the movie was never in the book. They have put things into the film just to make it move along at their required pace.

The movie looked as if it was filmed as it was supposed to be shown, then the beginnings and endings of each scene was scrapped. What is left is a skeleton of a film with actors lacking in talent, and dialogue lacking in luster or originality. The rapid pace of the film left the audience emotionally disconnected from each character, and unable to understand character relations. In the end, this is a film for children, not adults; children are the only people who will be able to sit through the entirety of such a poor film just to see a dragon (who by the way you'll be praying to die after hearing its string of unusually clichéd one-line comebacks.)",Eragon

The film did not contain enough of the story, some of the characters were not correct (elves & dwarfs are supposed to be elves & dwarfs), and they cut out so much vital parts that are in the book. I think they just wanted to create a quick movie and that was a sad mistake! What a shame that such a good book was made into a horrible movie. Now we will probably never get to see a part 2 movie to go along with the books unless someone remakes the first movie! What a waste!

667,burning_magnesium,A bad review about Eragon. (The movie).,2,16 December 2006,"(Spoilers contained too) OK!! Let me start by saying the movie was enjoyable. (Not necessarily good, but enjoyable).The first problem i had was the horrible dialog. E.g. ""We can do this together!! Together, nothing can stop us!! TOGETHER TOGETHER TOGETHER"". It sounded like some children's movie. Not something i'd expect a Dragon to say.. As noble as they are..The acting, apart from the part dialog was alright!! (JEREMY IRONS!! IS AWESOME!! as always!!) This is probably part of the script crappiness, but when Eragon wants to save those people, fervently, but gets distracted by training.. lol I didn't get that.. That and how he wanted to save the chick in his dream (Note: I have not read the books, i do not know the names). So it'll stay at the chick in his dream. The only motive he had from that was the clairvoyant, and the actual dream.. With the knowledge that he has to go into an enemy castle.. Which he has no knowledge of the layout etc etc.. The motive for all of it was unclear.. if i might add, Eragon.. The character (in the movie) seems a little confused.. and emotionally unstable. And should probably see a psychologist, or Psychiatrist of some sort.. All these things seem to happen to him.. But, he seems to hold no emotion after it happens.. After the initial thing with his uncle dying.. He was fine in the next scene.. problem child? I think so!! All in all.. I think this was rushed.. 90% running around in the countryside, 10% fight scenes. The fight scenes were alright.. The costumes and props weren't too bad. I liked the style they picked for the Varden..Lastly, (Spoiler bit).Did anyone see the part where they had the crossbowmen at the little bridge before the enemy people burst through? I swear that the one behind the other one had a clear shot at his head.. lol What's up with that? back guy, ""If you run away, i'll shoot you!!"", Front guy, ""Not if you run away first!"".Jeremy",Eragon

The acting wasn't very good apart from Rachel Weisz as Saphira, the dialogue was bad, and the story was terrible. They changed too much from the book in my opinion and their order of things was appalling. A friend of mine who is also a big fan of the novels told me of a review which is actually quite suitable. I can't remember exactly what it was, but it said something along the lines of: 'It was as if the people who made the films read the first 10 pages and then made a film out of it.' I really wish they had left Paolini's book as a book instead of making it into a film. It really felt as if they were desperately trying to fit it into an 1hr 30mins time frame, and if they had expanded it to a longer film with more accurate copying from the novel, plus a better cast, it would have been a great film. It's a shame it wasn't.",Eragon

I love the book. I got it when it first came out in summer of '03 and have read it about once every year since. Same thing with Eldest the sequel. The books are some of my favorites along with the originals (aka, Harry Potter, Lord of the Rings, The Chronicles of Narnia and all the rest out there that have been made into a movie, hint I always read the book first) and I am so glad that this finally made it to the big screen. The scenery in this movie is awesome. So natural looking and so fresh and clean. Of course it helps to see this in Digital Projection like I did. It was so crystal clear, it was amazing. I think this movie was kinda close to a PG-13 rating not too close but kinda close. I think it fits kinda everyone. Kids, teens, adults..... There are a lot of negative reviews out there at the moment but, not mine. I don't understand why every one thinks its so bad. Its kinda like star wars, lotr and harry potter but there's nothing wrong with that. The music was GREAT. Patrick Doyle did a great job. This movie now has its very ""own"" sound. Just like all the others do. And I want to thank Christopher Paolini for writing the book! And he is kinda my hero because he was home schooled and I am home schooled. GO CHRIS. Go see the movie.

Just sit back and relax and you won't be disappointed. I really don't understand those who are complaining about acting since it was OK. Eragon is being played by young Ed Speleers, 18 yo who was chosen after extensive search organised by 20th Century Fox. Academy award winning actor Jeremy Irons plays Brom (disent performance), Academy award nominee John Malkovich plays evil king Galbatoriks (nice and convincing performance), BAFTA award winner Robert Carlyle plays sorcerer Durza (I have to say that he looked great as villain), Academy award nominee Djimon Hounsouplays played Adihad and finally Sienna Guillory looked great as Arja.I also think that casting Academy award winning actress Rachel Weisz as a voice of Saphira was producer's best move. Her voice gives Saphira a note of elegance and contributes to her royal attitude.All in all, movie is great for relaxing (if you don't expect new LOTR or something like that).",Eragon

Aside from those, the plot didn't shine too much in terms of freshness (though I haven't read Eragon I can't help comparing it to Dragonheart) and the special-effects would be somewhere around mediocre considering the LoTR trilogy. Still, it was nice seeing Jeremy Irons and as far as the dragon is concerned, well.it works. Also, the ""dragon killer"" sword looked nice and it played its part just right :).

672,iive,A long time ago in a Kingdom far away,5,22 June 2007,"I must say that I enjoyed the movie. The scenery is beautiful, there is a lot of action, remarkable battles and some magic. However there is something terribly wrong with it. According to most of the comments here, the plot alteration compared to the book have taken the essence from the movie and had faced the actors with impossible task to bring something smelly to life.But that's not the worse part of it. I haven't read the book and I probably won't. But what is left from the book in the screenplay is 70% ""Star Wars - New Hope"".No, they are not Jedi, they are riders. They don't have light-sabers, they have dragons. The movie starts with chaise of a princes that holds something precious (no death star plans or robots here, not even ships, just a stone and horses). The princes is captured but not before she sends the precious stone away. The stone ends up in a young boy who works in his uncle farm, where he's been abandoned by his mother. There is the friend/cousin, who flee off the planet/village (well, he doesn't say he is going to join the rebels nor we see him in the final battle). The stone turns out to be dragon egg that hatches. This leads our hero to the only man who knows something about dragons - the local analog of Obi-Wan. The old man then have to take care of our young hero when imperial troops kill his uncle in their search for the stone. Of course the old man starts to teach his pupil but is killed when they attempt to save the princes from the enemy castle (just a normal castle, it doesn't fly and doesn't destroy princes' kingdom). After the successful rescue, guided by young mysterious archer/shooter (nothing like Han Solo) they flee to the rebel base where the final battle with empire forces takes place.",Eragon
673,toddhd,"Great movie, don't listen to the whiners",8,23 December 2006,"Eragon seems to receive a ton of flack from fans of the book. I haven't read the book, and so was able to rate the movie without the prejudice of expecting it live up to a pre-conceived idea.The story moves. In fact, it might move bit fast for the necessary character development and bonding, but there is never a point in the movie where you feel like it is boring or sitting still. The action is fast and rampant, and you can't help but cheer when the heroes kick in and soundly thrash the bad guys.The effects are awesome. The dragon is well animated, and I personally thought the magical effects were some of the best I've seen anywhere. Eragon is a wonderful hero, and gives us hope that if an average farm boy can become a hero, then anyone can.This movie is not for the very young, as the dragon and the bad guys are really quite believable and scary. I would say ages 10 and up would appreciate the movie.If you have read the book, then do yourself a favor and skip the movie rather than badmouth it. The movie on its own is a wonderful story, and since it clearly does not follow the book version of the story, it would be silly to even compare the two. Enjoy it for what it is, or skip it altogether. Well worth the price of admission. Had it been a little longer and had a little more character depth, it would have earned a higher rating from me.",Eragon

He loved the book so I was hoping the movie would be good but it just wasn't. The casting was terrible. They didn't get people that accurately reflected the characters in the book. Brom would not have done the things they had him do. It was not Brom who burned Garrow's farm or Garrow for that matter. It was the Razac. Brom did not rescue Eragon from the prison - it was Murtagh. Why would they change those important pieces for the movie? Why! Jeremy Irons & John Malkovich just showed up - they brought nothing to the roles. They changed important pieces in the story. The pacing was off. The script was off. We couldn't have been more disappointed. Let's hope they don't make a sequel!!,Eragon

I'd read the first book and liked it well enough, but that didn't really matter as the movie barely tries to stick to the novel at all. Anyway, we all had a great time at Eragon, mainly because everything that was wrong with it was hilarious. Some non-spoiler examples: saphira's egg looks like a giant viagra pill, Eragon wrestles in the hay with his cousin as they grunt heavily (you do the math), people say lines like ""I was expecting...more"" in throaty, creepy voices, Joss Stone attempts to act, and be blind, she fails at both, everyone is covered in muck except Eragon the supposed farm-boy, and let's not forget the insta-dragon! Guaranteed to grow to a full grown in dragon in five minutes! Who needs montages showing the passing of time when you have insta-dragon? Finally, Murtagh. Cute? Extremely. Given any motivation, back story, reason for existing and aiding our hero? Of course not! Who needs plot when you have sexy? For all these reasons and more I strongly recommend the renting of Eragon if you have had an absolutely depressing day and just really need a laugh-it will not disappoint!",Eragon
676,Swift07,Watch this without any other film in mind & it may be enjoyable...,7,20 December 2006,"Forget Lord of the Rings and Star Wars for that matter, everyone writes comments comparing Eragon to those classic movies, that just is not right. Watching Eragon with an open mind and seeing it for what it is you'd be able to realise that it is not a bad movie nor should it get the battering from critics, its undeserved.Yes the dialogue is patchy in places, but it is good in others. You are able to understand what the characters' motivations are. The movie may be named 'Eragon' after the main character, but the focus is also on the dragon Saphira, and this is where most of the joy comes from, watching the dragon bond with it's rider Eragon. There are no Oscar-worthy performances in Eragon, but that doesn't mean they did a bad job, i'd say the acting was average. It was what I expected, no more, no less.The score was great, it added a great emotional drive to the film, so credit has to go to Patrick Doyle. It creates more of an emotional attachment to Eragon and Saphira throughout the film and particularly towards the end. I went into this film with all the negative reviews and comments in mind, I also knew the 5/10 rating on this site. I thoroughly enjoyed the film and I wasn't expecting to!

The character, the plot, everything is all wrong. The graphics were very well done and Jeremy irons performance was great but the rest of the movie was utter Hollywoodized garbage. I mean it was cheesy and just bland. And I'm just as big of Eragon fan as anyone but this movie was horribly done.But Edward Speelers is a pretty good acting all in all and he has a bright future ahead of him although they might be one sided because of this movie thats all folks and i hope i didn't offend to many die hard fans out there",Eragon
678,lukifer_88,"Eragon tries hard, but fails to engage.",4,29 March 2007,"When I popped the DVD in the player, I promised myself to be objective and ignore all the criticism. There were a couple of redeeming qualities in this film, but the bad outweighs the good.The summary is very cliché and has already worked in so many other fantasy stories. A lowly farm boy is swept into a rebellion as the last hope to save the kingdom/world/universe. Eragon, the farm boy, stumbles upon a stone with ends up being a dragon egg. He learns he's the new hope for the 'dragon riders.' You can probably fill in the blanks with your knowledge of fantasy movies.The Good: I really enjoyed the relationship between Eragon and the dragon, Saphira. The special effects were not groundbreaking, but decent nonetheless. Saphira's voice-over work by Rachel Weisz was great and Ed Speelers was decent in the roll of Eragon. Also, Kudos to Jeremy Irons as Brom.The Bad: Obvious plot similarities to Star Wars and LOTR. After about 15 minutes, my objectivity turned into finding the parallels to the other films. Urgals=Orcs, Dragon Riders=Jedi, Brom=Obi Wan, Ra'zaks(sp)=Ringwraiths/riders... it goes on and on. Even when trying to put these out of my mind, the movie was not engaging enough to keep my attention. The dialog was bad, and the fighting, with one or two exceptions, was laughable. It also turn me off that 15 minutes into the movie I predicted the rest of the plot. I also understand that the director had to take some liberties from the book to set it apart from other fantasy/sci-fi films. That isn't a good sign in adapting a novel.Overall, Eragon is worth a rental at best.",Eragon

While my sister had said there were some changes from the book to the movie, it still stayed true to the original story. I've never seen a better looking animated dragon - they had some amazing work in this film. The story is great. Everyone I know so far has enjoyed this movie, and we're are planning a third stop by the theater to see it.

Here is why.,1,15 December 2006,"I am going to put this plainly and straight out with the facts and finish up with me I left with two impressions of this film. It was made to make money, not in the desire to make this great book come to life. And two, it reminded me of the old Hercules T.V. show its special affects, dialogue, action scenes, and character development, Horrid.People actually booed in my theatre at the midnight showing with a full house. There was even a boy crying to his mom telling her that they ruined it afterwards with her comforting him. No joke! For those that read the book this is what they kept, with me inserting much of what they added.The names: Saphira, Brom, Arya. Durza. King Galbatorix, Murtagh, Roran, Angela who makes a brief appearance.The Story: 10 min: Eragon picking up the egg, egg hatches (then uh oh this right?) Saphira flies for the first time as a youngling and within some lighting full matures and comes out of the clouds as an adult exclaiming! ""I have been waiting for you a thousand years, I am Saphira you are Eragon!

The end.Horrible I will never buy it, nor will I ever see it again. I right this honestly and truthfully as you watch it (gasp I hope not) you will notice many other key things they forgot: Character Development, Eragons relationship with Saphira and him raising her, Arya sickness, Urgals as fat bald men, ARGH basically everything.Insert>Dramatic Music Written by a truly sad fan.

681,loreendekort,Movie had potential but missed the bar,5,17 December 2006,"This movie was not good or bad, which says a lot about the film right there. In the fantasy movie realm, you generally find movies to have made the firm leap, one way or the other. It will be either very good or very bad. This film, however, has a firm grasp on being completely mediocre. The thing which grinds the nerves is that you leave the theater with a feeling that it could have been so much more than it was. This is the real pity.John Malkovich could have phoned in his part for as little impact as he had in the film. This is amazing to me considering that his presence in a scene generally causes the eye to just draw to whatever he is saying or doing. His personality just screams ""Excuse me, I'm here and you WILL notice me"" when he is on camera. In this film, he seemed as bored with the script as the audience around me was. Perhaps in the sequel, his role will be revisited, hopefully with a stronger screenplay and a more genre-seasoned director. (Peter J., Richard D., Steven S. are you hearing this?) Jeremy Irons can chalk this up as yet another failed fantasy movie attempt. Hopefully at some point, a screenplay which can live up to his acting ability will meet up with him in a crowded bar and buy him a drink. I had the feeling he really was trying very hard to make a silk's purse out of a sow's ear, but the pig just refused to cooperate.If I had the unenviable task of casting this movie, I would have switched Irons with Malkovich. I feel he would have done much better as Galbatorix and Malkovich would have made a better troubled and guilt-laden Brom. Nobody does angst as well as Malkovich (Rent ""Dangerous Liaisons"" for his portrayal as Valmont) and Iron's gravelly voice lends itself well to angry rants and ravings as one would expect from an evil King.As to the hero, Eragon, well, I disagree with Brom's assessment. He was not quite 3 parts fool. He was 100% fool. He didn't seem heroic at all. He only seemed to be an angry teenager who thought he knew better than everyone else around him with nothing to base that assumption on. I'd like just once to see a hero not be such a complete idiot. It's almost assumed that the Luke Skywalker 'I am too a big boy!' mentality is sure to be present in the reluctant young hero-types of these films, but good gracious Georgina, did they have to go to this extreme? You can see the script tried to play on the 'my mother abandoned me and this is why I sing' angle in a passing aside, but it missed the mark by a league. He only came across as surly, not an object of sympathy. I'm unsure if the acting or directing is at fault being as I have never seen this actor before and have no basis of comparison.Generally, this movie I would say is an OK watch if you just want to go to a movie this weekend, but do not get your hopes up to high. This is no Lord of the Rings epic masterpiece at work here. Nor is it as bad as others may lead you to think.",Eragon
682,thrads,Mediocre,5,5 December 2006,"Say what you will, but Eragon can be a compelling story regardless of what you think it ripped off. With that in mind, I give you Edward Speelers...who probably wouldn't know something compelling if it hit him in the face. In fact, I doubt he would even flinch if something hit him in the face. The biggest problem with Eragon is who plays Eragon himself.There's an innocence-turned-hard required for this role, but Speelers has one facial gesture: solemnity. When he laughs or smiles or cries (tries to, anyway), it is not believable. He is as wooden a leading actor that I have ever seen in a mainstream film. The fact that the story and the movie is carried upon his shoulders is a problem.The rest of the performances are at least a little better; John Malkovich chews up the scenery like no other, and it works here. Carlyle's Durza is truly a menace, even though his most prominent scenes are often shrouded in special effects.That is another thing: the special effects. Some are absolutely stunning (Saphira, the journey through the mountains), yet some are so shoddy that they make you roll your eyes. It's almost as if the filmmakers spent far too much time on Saphira and the accompanying flying scenes to be bothered to put much effort into the rest of them.In summary, it can be thrilling and visually stimulating at times, but Speelers falls so flat that it ultimately is forgettable. It's a shame that this is a such a mediocre film.",Eragon
683,vauxhallrd,i want my money back,1,20 December 2006,"With a stellar cast and some very good special effects, one might assume that the film Eragon, following in the wake of lotr might achieve a modicum of success.

685,alhoot,"No story, plot or character development",3,24 April 2007,"I was very disappointed by this movie. Special effects were the main focus. Character development, relationships between characters and storyline were lacking. The story was so condensed it was hard to follow. The characters and story bear little resemblance to the book, other than they share the same names. For example, Brom appeared early in the movie as a rather seedy looking ""poacher"" and had little development. In the book Brom's character was more noble and had many aspects, none of which were like the movie. The hero and the villains were unconvincing. Some of the hero's actions while flying were so ridiculous they should have been in a cartoon. Many of the changes from the book were at the expense of plot and character development.

687,tolkienmex,Eragon: the next great fantasy,8,18 December 2006,"Eragon Directed by: Stefen Fangmeier With: Jeremy Irons, Edward Spellers""Our beautiful lands have been ravaged by a ruthless king. And our people live under the shadow of tyranny. It wasn't always like that. There was a time when our people lived in peace. Protected by warriors astride mighty dragons"". That's the way in which Brom, the old storyteller, tells us about the suffering of his dear land, Alagaesia, once a prosperous place, but now under the oppression of King Galbatorix. Alagaesians' hope lies on a young dragon rider, named Eragon, to lead them to freedom.We're talking about ""Eragon"", the new major motion picture based on the first chapter of the ""Inheritance"" trilogy, written by Christopher Paolini. Let's start by saying that most of which can be criticized about the novel can also be about the film: the tribute (or, as others might call it ""piracy"") of some elements from Star Wars, Earthsea or The Lord of the Rings; the lack of deepness of the plot, that sometimes, appears to have been taken from an uninspired Tolkien, etc. Despite all those elements, and a poor script, Eragon is an interesting ""pop corn"" film that, as long as approaches the final 30 minutes, becomes more and more appealing, concluding with some scenes (I'm not going to tell the end of the picture, if you want to know go to your favorite Theater or buy the book) that leaves us sincerely hoping for the movie to be successful, so the other 2 parts of the story may be also put into film.The plot begins when Eragon (Edward Spellers), a young hunter that lives with his uncle and cousin, ¿casually? finds a blue gem that turns to be nothing but a dragon's egg, stolen by the Princess Arya (A beautiful Sienna Guillory) from King Galbatorix himself. Realizing the loss, Galbatorix sends Durza, his best serf, to find and kill Eragon, and, by consequence, destroy the dragon and the threat it represents.In the middle of this complicated situation, our hero will count with the help of the village's storyteller, Brom (Jeremy Irons) and a mysterious character whose past lays a shadow of suspicion behind him.The film is not as magnificent as ""The Lord of The Rings"" ones, but has great special effects, standing out the huge realism of Saphira's character, that becomes a vital part on the plot In short, it's an interesting story (even when it's not the most original in town), averagely well told, with good acting, great special effects and an excellent soundtrack composed by Patrick Doyle (Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire), which also includes Avril Lavigne's new single: ""Keep holding on"".Eragon sure is, as the Twentieth Century Fox promotional posters put it ""The next great fantasy""",Eragon
688,celesmoon,"Good visuals, deja-vu storyline",4,30 December 2006,"As I am a fervid fan of fantasy, I had great expectations on Eragon, especially after hearing Jeremy Irons and John Malkovich were part of the cast, but sadly I had been disappointed.Good: 1) visual effects; 2) camera angles; 3) the dragon;Bad: 1) unoriginal predictable storyline; 2) plain underdeveloped characters; 3)leading cast and roles distribution; 4) scenery;Neutral: 1) music, not too bad nor too good to be noticed.---ON DETAIL---First of all the global storyline is very simple, so linear, that is boringly predictable: there is no use of suspense devices and the viewer could easily and correctly guess what will happen only seeing the first half hour of the movie.I would have avoided a harsh criticism if the weak storyline introduced new and fresh elements, unique features that would have distinguished Eragon from the other fantasy movies (a la Mirrormask, Narnia, Harry Potter, and so on), but that was not the case, and during the view of the movie you feel a sense of strong deja-vu, like you're seeing a bad script of Lord of the Rings mixed with Dungeon and Dragons.The most disappointing point for me though was the cast; if the skill of an actor is measured by the level of sympathy or emotion it awakes in the viewer, then Edward Speelers (Eragon) did a very poor job, or should rethink his career, may I suggest modeling?, because he has a very charming face. Even if you try to care for the hero, you don't feel involved in his adventure and you don't cheer for him, but start instead to feel attached to the virtually created dragon, Sapphira, that I admit, it's very beautiful and lovable.Jeremy Irons (Brom) was a saving anchor every time he appeared on the screen; I had the impression one of his tasks was to support Speelers on his debut, and despite the script and his role, he tried very hard, but with the result of stealing the scene to the guy. In other words, it was not a good idea to pair Speelers with a more experienced actor. Not that it was difficult to shadow Eragon, even Gareth Hedlund (Murtagh) managed that with his few appearances on screen.What upset me the most was that they wasted Malkovich's talent giving him the obsolete role of King Albatorix. I hope that Albatorix will be a more complex character and will be on screen more than a global five minutes!The scenery always consisted in trees and trees and more trees, some mountain, some woods, some caves; it seems all the budget was spent on special effects and they had to cut on background decorations.So now you'll be wondering why I gave 4 stars instead of one: because I liked the dragon and loved the camera angles they applied to transmit the sensation of flying. It seemed like you were riding the dragon.-------------Globally, I think Eragon is good to see on TV or when you don't have anything better to do than spend the afternoon seeing a rented movie.AVOID ABSOLUTELY:if you're seeking a complex twisted plot, if you need suspense; if you are a fan of Harry Potter, Lord of the Rings, Narnia, and you hope to find a substitute/similar work.",Eragon

When Eragon went to Gil'ead , Brom was never shown going with him, yet then he ends up in Gil'ead just as Durza throws a spear at Eragon. The graphics and acting was great. I would like Fox to release an extended edition for this movie with all the deleted scenes added in so that the movie is easier to follow. As well, I really want Fox to make Eldest into a movie. Eragon was an amazing movie and I saw it twice. The movie could have been a lot better and should have been longer. 103 minutes was not enough to show the whole story!

AND of course now I am truly motivated to read the book ... happened when I watched Harry Potter ... now I gotta read this book too! Usually, more often than not, I prefer the books - only time will tell!

The same characters, the same non-existent character development, the same unfolding plot. A self-doubting protagonist, a cynical wiser and older mentor, a sacrifice to spurn the birth of a hero, an evil tyrant. A battle and romance.Pros: beautiful cinematography and stunning special effects, suspends your disbelief, and makes you believe for the briefest of moments, that Dragon did exist.Cons: 1. Awful casting. John Malkovic seems completely out of place as does Jeremy Irons. Only Robert Carlyle's (as the evil Shade) performance is worth any notice. Edward Speleers disappoints in his transition from boy to hero. 2. Cheesy lines. Could there be a movie filled with more off note heroic monologue? Fantasy can reveal the thoughts of characters without uttering a word in a particular scene. 3. Clumsy character development. Jeremy Iron's character ""Brom"" - is so under developed that his presence is insignificant. Just doesn't leave a lasting impression. 4. Plot unfolding is terrible. Momentum is everywhere. I was disappointed in the development of the Dragon and the revelation of Dragon history. Frustration is often more prominent than suspense and involvement.Left this one thinking - where is Peter Jackson when you need him?One for the kids, not for true Fantasy fans.",Eragon
692,mr_c_bowler,"Merely mediocre movie, TERRIBLE adaptation",1,5 July 2018,"About a month ago I re-read the Inheritance trilogy for the first time since it originally came out. Amazing book series. Has a very strong story full of well presented and thought out characters and the world building is fantastic. As with the books, I decided to re-watch this movie for the first time since release and let me tell ya, it is terrible. It might be a good movie for someone that hasn't read the books. Actually, no, I take that back. I think it would be merely mediocre.The movie has none of the fantastic world building that the books have. I really wanted to see the mighty Tronjheim within Farthen Dur and the movie shows some hovel within a cave. All of the mystery surrounding if Empire will find Eragon or not is gone. The mystery of who Brom is is gone. They leave no mystery for any of the movie! What is this!!! The characters were mostly well cast. 
Sienna Guillory as Arya could have used some prosthesis to make her more Elf like. 
Ed Speleers was decent enough, need some more acting lessons though. 
John Malkovich as Galbatorix?!?! Come on! Galbatorix is supposed to be menacing, and have the most commanding, silver tongued voice around! Not hating on John Malkovich, he's a good actor, just a terrible choice for Galbatorix (don't even get me started on why he isn't even necessary for this movie)
And Brom! Daaaaaaammmmmn, they definitely picked the right actor for Brom. Jeremy Irons was a superb choice for Brom. I suspect that the only reason I didn't like the character was the shoddy writing and directing. The movie is good for something though. It can be used as an example of a director not trusting his audience will figure out the hidden meaning on their own.I'm actually really sad that I watched this movie because I know that it will taint my memory of the books.I highly recommend that 20th Century Fox sell the movie rights to HBO because this could make an AMAZING series to follow Game of Thrones.

The rest were just really bad actors that had no emotion in their faces, they were like robots that seemed to have to over or under exaggerate everything. Then, I thought that Rachel Weisz's voice (Saphira) was a really bad choice, I mean, this is a dragon and it ought to sound a bit more tough, I don't mean that it was horrible but more of a tough woman would have been good in my opinion. As for the PG rating, this movie is made for kids while majority of people reading the books are mostly teenagers and older, this movie could have been slightly (and I mean slightly!) better if it had been PG16 or higher! They cut off scenes to replace with other ones and I think that was a bad idea! I understand part of it has to be cut out and even modified but to completely change the book was just stupid. Nothing seemed to make sense in that movie, nothing was well explained and they're didn't even seem to be a story to it at all!

Holy smoke was I disappointed... they skipped over 1/2 the book missing some of the key points of development like how hard it is to journey through the mountains. They made it look like the journey took 10 minutes. My wife, who had not read the book, thought it was OK if a bit jumpy and hard to understand why some characters do what they do. Not a good adaptation of a book in my opinion, nor really a good choice of a book to make into a movie to begin with.

A book tends to be able to convey way more detail and plot than a movie because movies are only 90 minutes+ and a book contains hours of material. To expect a movie to follow the exact or closely related story plot of the book is to expect the impossible...unless you make an epic such as Lord of the Rings. This movie totally rocked!!! I keep reading people's comments that seem to pick everything apart, from story, plot formation, acting, directing, etc. Sorry but I disagree with every negative comment I read. Acting was superb by new and seasoned cast members. The directing seemed very adequate, and the story was excellent. Again, I'm glad I don't read much because I prefer to visualize a story than read about it and try to imagine what the author is conveying. Maybe I would feel different if I had read the book first, but I doubt it because I tend to separate movies from books with the realistic expectation that the movie will not contain the same elements as the book. It's the same principle as going to a concert and expecting the music to sound exactly as it did on the studio recorded CD. Usually not going to happen...with exceptions of course.

The guy who played Durza and the girl who played Saphira did good jobs, and Murtagh was fairly decent, but everyone else was average or below....Although I must say, Ed Speelers does fill out his leather pants quite nicely :-D And there's a scene or two of him without his shirt...also worth seeing :-) The movie as a whole seems very ""choppy""...no continuity...jumps from one thing to the other without much explanation of new characters, or events. Perhaps if the movie were longer they could've done more with it, but as it is, it's not anything spectacular.

I have to fill up 10 lines. So I need to write, write, write. Let's see how many sentences that is? OK, it's 8 so I need this sentence and one more. I loved the movie, ERAGON!!",Eragon
701,beowulf8,"Cliché, but still watchable.",6,20 January 2007,"Readers of the original fiction are disappointed by Eragon.However, if you haven't really glance the novel and just wanna have some entertainment, Eragon is definitely qualified for a watchable film. It's full of common motifs like tyrant, freedom fighter, love, and initiations as in ""the Lord of the Rings"" and ""Harry Potter"". Fortunately, Eragon is an acceptable combination of these elements. You can hardly fall asleep although the plot seems so cliché.The protagonist, Eragon himself, has done a pretty good job in his debut. Probably a new face like this adds some diversity to the film. It's just not as drowsy as it seems to be.",Eragon
702,tromnick,Not even close.,1,6 January 2009,"Wow. I mean, really...wow. First of all, I read the books (before seeing the movie), which were pretty good. Of course, I had no real great expectations, I fully expected many details to be left out and plot jumps here and there. But not to the level in which this movie production takes it.Where to begin? Awful script, more (and better!) dialogue was needed in the movie. Awful character development, there was basically none. Awful plot development...besides not even being remotely close to the book's storyline, the movie felt the need to blurt out millions of details at once. Example: Eragon had no idea who the person (Arya) in his dreams was until he eventually saved her. IN the movie, they somehow magically introduce themselves withing the dream. What? That leaves out a very important plot development aspect...the kind of thing the film missed the entire time.In other words, there was no depth to the movie at all. IT was a list of events that occurred in succession, with a list of names to help guide along. I'm sorry for being so negative, but I've never seen a worse attempt at turning a book into a movie.Some characters were downright wrong. In the books, Angela is elusive, but also kind of aloof. IN the movie, she seems mysterious, but nowhere near the aloofness (why was everything so damned serious in the movie!?!? Why were there no moments of levity?) THere was no good aspects at all...Saphira was kind of a bright spot, but not really. The CG of her could've been better, in my opinion. John Malkovich was an interesting choice, but he had about 2 lines in the movie.Oh, and not to mention the plot moved WAAAY too fast. It could easily have been twice as long, and probably should have been (given the plot).Just plain awful.",Eragon
703,Caldevwin,Huge disappointment!,1,15 December 2006,"I've just returned from the cinema, and I'm glad I'm out of that room. If you have read the book before watching the movie, like myself, you are in for a HUGE disappointment! The only thing, and then I mean the ONLY thing, thats similar to the book, is the characters' names. The rest is just made up as they saw fit. Not even the storyline is the same.Apart from not being true to the book, the film was of poor entertainment and with bad acting. Most of the characters are taken right out of a 'Xena - The Warrior Princess' episode. The ""heroes"" look like cheap soap opera actors, and the villains like brainless cartoon idiots.The only ones who will find this film entertaining are the children, all mature audience should stay clear, or rent the DVD when it comes out. But the best thing is to borrow it from someone else so you don't have to spend any money on it.",Eragon
704,dngn_rdr,Great Book; Shame about the Movie,7,2 January 2007,"The characterization is virtually non-existent, the storyline moves along at such a pace you could drive a truck through the plot holes, and some of the best characters were not even... but the entire mess can be placed at the feet of the screenplay which has totally butchered what I think was a great book (superb considering the age at the time of the writer)./end rant.If I hadn't read the book first I would probably not be as jaded and enjoyed it far more. The locations were stunning, the special effects (especially Saphira) were exceptional and the cast did a superb job with the material they were given... novice Edward Speleers was almost born for the role; Jeremy Irons, John Malkovich and Robert Carlyle each put their all into the role. Sienna Guillory had an uphill battle given her role was empty of the depth and detail provided by the book but succeeded admirably (and was stunning as per usual). I did find however that while I liked Rachel Weisz' performance as the voice of Saphira, the lack of any effect given that the voice was supposed to be in Eragon's mind alone struck me as peculiar.In conclusion... if you haven't read the book, rent the DVD but don't bother going to see it at the movies. If you have read the book - read it again and save your money.",Eragon
705,TeenChrist87,Simply GREAT,6,28 December 2006,"I really don't understand why everyone hates this movie. I think I consider it to be my favorite movie of all time. I can't get enough of it. I went to see it when it came out on December 15 and I had to see it again. Today, Dec. 28, my friend and I went to see it. I can't get enough of this great movie. The script, acting, and CGI are all brilliant! I've read about half of the book and while it IS different, I don't care. I don't judge the movie by the book and everyone else should stop doing it. I think on New Years I'll go to see it again. The movie is rated PG, but I do think it should have been rated PG-13. I am 19 years old, and I was really creeped out by the sorcerer Durza. Each time he was shown I sunk down in my seat. I wouldn't recommend this to kids under 11. I watch Harry Potter and The Lord of the Rings and the villains aren't quite as scary as Durza.

Two cinematic trilogies with strong themes, great acting, passion and dimensional characters. The acting, plot and pace of this first installment of ""Eragon"" were terrible. The struggles the main character and his shallow band of supporters have to go through are not weighty enough to garner even an ""Eragon Part One"". Poor Irons, having to rehash words similar to lines from the first Star Wars. And what is that king doing, just sitting there? Some king. An ""Error"" to say the least. Let's hope Malkovich and Irons don't have to trouble with parts two and three! Two stars for the computer graphics and for Speelers in those lace-up leather pants.",Eragon

They didn't concentrate on Any one Part of the Book. They might as well have read crib notes on the WHOLE story line, and SLAPPED it together. IF they would have concentrated on 1 Part of the story line, THEN ran through the rest...It might have had some context. The beginning is to Rushed, to short and adds little to the movie and is PART of the whole story line. VERY little is mentioned about his mother, but that IS a plot point. and is never stressed. Who, was this Son of WHOM. THIS is another Plot point that is added, and never played up. And the Ex-dragon rider...Wheres the TRAINING. Wheres the history Plot line he was supposed to give the character.This is worse then the DUNE movies.. I cant give it a worse score, I HAVE seen worse. But there is NO LINE to follow.

708,swordsandsandals,Fangmeier Should stick to effects.,3,9 January 2007,"You've heard it all before  a young hero, a benevolent but firm mentor, death of said mentor, an epic quest, and throw in a hot elf - you've pretty much got Eragon. But the book was entertaining enough. Despite a pretty formulaic lord of the rings rip off, it had some original touches and decent characters. It is therefore a crying shame when the film adaptation does a half hearted job on an enjoyable, if unoriginal, book such as Eragon.Not only is the author of the books a novice, so is the director. Stefen Fangmeier takes the helm, and it is quickly painstakingly obvious that he should stick to effects. This film is as devoid of character development as women are of the Y chromosome. Nothing is apparent in our young hero's quest of how it is going to affect him, it just happens. The script skims over the plot, even adding its own sub-stories, and removing plot lines liberally from the source novel. The result is a shallow unsatisfying end product, that happens far too quickly to produce a decent, rounded story. The script is mainly to blame for the numerous flaws of Eragon, with such atrocities as Saphira's line, 'Did somebody mention flying?' When this was spoken I could sense film lovers all through the audience cringing at its awkward delivery.In fact, the character of Saphira is never properly nailed throughout the whole of Eragon. Not even Rachel Weisz could make the audience appreciate that Saphira is a character. She delivers the lines as if it is just a menial chore she has to do before getting on with the proper work. Despite better than average effects, Saphira is never a character, or one of the majestic beasts that Jeremy Irons' Brom keeps referring to. By the end of the film I was fed up with Saphira, and when Fangmeier tries his hand at sentimentality, I couldn't have cared less if she had died. The friendliness and charm of the book's dragon has all evaporated.Most disappointingly absent from the film version of Eragon is a decent fight scene. In the film it is a perfunctory affair, with standard shots of leading characters swinging weapons at the orc-wannabes known as Urgals. What could have been a Rings or Narnia affair is instead boring and short, made worse by Robert Carlyle hamming it up as the shade, Durza.As for Ed Speleers, there is definitely potential, but once again Fangmeier fails to exploit this. The latest to join the ranks of teen actors struggles with the script, but he isn't as bad as, say, Daniel Radcliffe in the earlier Potter films.But, despite clunky script and a second rate Saphira, the film is brilliant to look at, with fantastic shots of the Hungarian countryside. Sweeping shots of the protagonists riding their horses through a middle earth2 is not necessarily a bad thing, and makes up for other poor aspects of the film. Also, kids will love it as an unchallenging, tame fantasy adventure that should keep them occupied for the thankfully short running time.Verdict: Although not as bad as many critics made out, this is still a painfully shallow affair, with little in the way of decent storytelling, and even less in the field of character development. Let's hope the sequel realises its errors.",Eragon
709,CrouchingTiger15,Film-making at its worst,1,14 December 2006,"There is certainly something for everyone in this movie. That is, something for everyone to absolutely detest. Personally, I was struck by the horrid acting in this movie. The main characters all seemed to be warming up for the day of shooting in the shots chosen. They're characters were one dimensional at best and 9 times out of 10 they weren't even remotely believable. The best acting came from a poorly CGIed dragon with the completely unbelievable voice of Rachel Weisz.If the acting doesn't kill you, the film-making is next on the list. There are so many lens flares and disgustingly nauseating camera movements that you'll be using your popcorn bag as a barf bag. If I saw another Hitchcock ""dolly and zoom"" (like in Vertigo) I would have very seriously considered walking out of the movie. Those camera movements only have meaning if you use them sparingly and intentionally at key moments. This movie very much represented a film student's first work, when they are eager to try all the tricks, movements, and shots they've seen in great movies before.MINOR SPOILER WARNING BELOWAnd, lastly, if you can see past all of these things, you will not miss the fact that the story is a very blatant mixture of Lord of the Rings and Star Wars. It starts with a princess who has stolen something from the evil ruler and now tries to smuggle it to her hidden base. I was looking for R2D2 and C3PO to appear. We also learn that ""Shades"" can apparently use force strangle like Darth Vader. And of course, there are many Lord of the Rings-like things (elves and dwarfs, Eragon/Aragorn and Aria/Arwen, etc). Some of the shots were even framed identically to shots from Lord of the Rings. END SPOILERSUnfortunately, while this film tries to copy Lord of the Rings and Star Wars, it has nowhere near the storyline, effects, or acting in either of them (including Episode I, so that's pretty bad). Save the money or use it to go see dancing penguins or James Blond playing poker for two hours. Between a horrible script, even worse acting, awkward editing, shaky-at-best camera work, a blatant lack of directing, cheap CGI and other effects, and a pace that drags like a car with both rear tires shot out, this movie bombs. You'll spend more time talking about how bad it is than you will in the theater actually watching it.",Eragon
710,thebeeny,Whatever happened to Katrina?,2,23 March 2007,"Let me just start by saying this film got a 2 because of two things--Saphira's voice over, and, of course, the wonderful effects.But it's plainly ridiculous. The first thing that I noticed wrong with the movie was the lack of Katrina--WHO IS HALF THE PLOT OF ELDEST!! I was so angry. And Roran's lack of part was kind of hurtful.The biggest problem i had with the beginning was Saphira's naming herself. It seemed very important to me that she was named after Brom's dragon. And it kind of hurts to have it left out.And it was so stupid and anti-climactic not to break the star...ALL IN ALL, WE NEED ANOTHER VERSION, PLEASE!!! Same graphics team, same Voice over for saphira--NEW script and replace everyone but Brom.",Eragon
711,Hotty91488,Beginning to end without a middle!,1,18 December 2006,"This movie was probably the biggest let down next to Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban. Why?!- How?! Could Christopher Paolini allow someone to make a complete catastrophe out of his beautiful, hard work?!? Eragon and the Eldest are the fantasy books for the new generations and the movie is a complete failure! Even those who have not read the book asked if it jumped around a lot because it did not make sense. The script was poorly written, the wardrobe did not suite the time period  I mean, Roran was the only person wearing blue pants. I think they were jeans even! The makeup artist(s) did a god awful job on the Urgals. They were men with paint on them I can do that on Halloween! There were no dwarfs at all! How disappointing! What? Do the screen writers have something against what Peter Jackson did in Lord of the Rings? Because at least he put effort into his movie and didn't spend more on advertising than the production of the film! I was hoping for something spectacular, a movie that could try to live up to Lord of the Rings or Pirates of the Carrabiean but there is no hope! An entirely new crew needs to make the Eldest because Eragon has bombed there is no way that the Eldest will even make box-office its first weekend if the same people create the second movie. When it comes to making a great movie people are looking for the appearance of it. I will give credit to the graphic design on Saphira she was awesome and so was Jeremy Irons he's a wonderful actor. Sadly, the writers decided to make Brom the evil teacher in the book, Brom and Eragon gain a certain understanding and bond there was nothing like that in the movie! Also, what was with the elf?! She didn't look like and elf. She had red hair instead of black and she didn't have pointed ears that's what makes an elf an elf F.Y.I! Can we send an emergency message to Peter Jackson or George Lucas that there are fans looking for their beautiful, flawless, expertise on movies, PLEASE!",Eragon

As for the film,,,, well they really did as good as they could on it. Saphira was quite magnificent. Jeremy Irons and Robert Carlyle were both excellent. and the young lad Sepeelers was pretty good too. All in all a quite satisfying afternoon at the movies.AS for the artistic licence with the story line. Its impossible to make a movie that follows the book to the letter, no one can do it, and no one should really try. The movie makers did an excellent job here compress an epic story into a size-able chunk. Yes it was noticeable at times that they moved time forward very quickly (like saphiras growth spurt, and Eragons easy mastery of magic) but what can you expect. WE enjoyed it and look forward, hopefully, to watching the sequel.",Eragon

If you are alone, on a rainy and cold Sunday afternoon, nothing to do, nothing to watch...

The story was written by a child for other children. This is not Lord of the Rings or Star Wars nor was it intended to be. As long as you keep that in mind you won't be disappointed with this movie. Take a kid with you and watch their eyes light up when they see the baby dragon and then tell me it was a bad movie.I also read the books and from an adult's viewpoint the books are much better because the author goes into much more detail. While I was watching the movie I kept thinking it was in fast-forward mode because there were a lot of areas skipped.Bottom line: Could they have made a better more character/story driven movie tailored for adults? Yes. Was this story intended for adults? No. It is just as good as Narnia and doesn't even come close to Lord of the Rings.",Eragon

Eragon is Luke, Brom is Obi Wan, King Galbatorix is the emperor, Arya is Leia, etc. The Darth Vader character is already dead and so is Luke, I mean Eragon's aunt, but it's still pretty close. Closer than The Fast and the Furious was to Point Break even. I haven't read the book, so I don't know if this is the fault of the author or the screenplay writer.

718,rbrewer92,"Pop quiz: An ""Eragon"" Review",6,16 December 2006,"OK, class. Pop quiz. What sci-fi/fantasy movie did I see today? You've got the young hero -- the reluctant 'chosen one'. Blonde, farm boy, raised by his uncle, never knew his parents. He encounters his gray-haired, outcast mentor, who teaches him to use the power of his mind, gives him a magic sword, and tells him tales of more peaceful times when people were protected by this elite team of guardians with magic powers. All was well until one of the magic-wielding guardians turned evil and wiped out all the others.The mentor starts the hero on a quest, during which the hero storms the fortress of the head evil guy's (magic-wielding) second-in-command, who is holding the rebel princess hostage. The mentor is slain in a fight with the evil second-in-command, and the hero, the princess, and his dark-haired comrade (whom no one really knows if they can trust) join the rebels in a big battle with the evil empire, where it carries the day (thanks to the hero's flying skills), but the head evil guy is ready to strike back in the second film of this trilogy.Hint: there's more than one right answer.

Christopher Paolini must be mortified, or at least he should be! I can't answer for what these people envisioned for Eragon but I pray that this wasn't it! The characters are awful and so is the script. It's torture to watch Jeremy Irons struggle to at least improve the situation but even though he is talented and always does his best there's only so much he can do. The whole story is flat and uninteresting and I found that I really couldn't care less what happened to anyone, least of all Eragon. Further more the butchering of the book eliminated several important characters and events that only adds to the misery that is Eragon the movie. It is never easy to change a book into a movie but by God they have to be able to do a better job than this.My only hope is that they stop at one movie and leave the rest of the books alone!",Eragon
720,jorgen.lindqvist,Let's promote the bad result to something great,3,30 January 2007,"I must say I had high expectations on this movie. There has been a lot of promotion and even a game, that of course is total crap as well. Everything looked great in the game and the movies doesn't look to bad either but that's the only good thing to say about it. I've read some comments about the book being quite good but it's a bit hard to believe after seeing this movie. Although I must admit the book has to be better. The story is extremely week and things just happen without any logic to it. Since I'm a big fan of Raymond E. Fiest the whole dragon riding concept seems to be ripped straight from his books with the legendary Valheru. I do not object too much to this behavior since is very hard to find something completely unique in most fantasy. It's great with this fantasy trend we got but no special effects or promotion could ever make a bad script into something good. Who would have believed that Peter Jackson would ever direct Lord of the Rings. Well for all those great books that have been written we need people that understands them and love them. If the Eragon novel actually is good it only tells me we need a whole new breed of directors to actually do the novels some justice. We certainly don't need SFX and promo.",Eragon
721,ski_man731,Almost Complete Crap (spoilers),1,16 December 2006,"OK, so i have been waiting for this movie to come out for near a year now. I was all sorts of excited for December 15th. Now I want to shoot myself. This movie was bad. People that have read the books hate it because it has (a few of) the same characters and (a few of) the locales that are present in the book. People that have not read the books are going to see this movie and say, ""wow i hope i never read anything like what i just saw."" The movie made next to no sense chronologically, skipping around everywhere. I mean the book is almost as long if not longer than the Fellowship of the Ring and yet this movie was just over half the running time as LoTR:FoTR. So how could you fit all of that in? You can't. That is why Saphira suddenly grows with a few lightning strikes and Arya is suddenly all better from Durza's torture and Eragon magically learns the ancient language and the battle of Farthen Dur shows about a thousand or so soldiers marching in and maybe twenty of them actually fighting. There are no dwarfs (just so humans that stand next to Ajihad that i think might be Hrothgar), Hrothgar's name is never mentioned, Katrina is never mentioned, Angela's fortune was crap, Urgals are just big men with face-paint, Ajihad says about five words, Murtagh has some crappy ""funny"" lines, Saphira just suddenly learns to fly and knows her name, the ra'zac die, and they use the supposedly clever line ""one part brave, three parts fool"" way to many times. Sure I can't expect it to follow the book exactly but I would like it to at least have the main story lines of the book, not just the one! And I should not have the expectations of LoTR but this movie was just plain bad. I give this movie a three because i thought Speelers plays a very believable Eragon, the special effects are great, the landscapes are great, and Arya is fairly well done. Those are tho only two characters that you actually see through the whole movie. Saphira is by far the most entertaining character. This movie made me depressed because i would have rather sat on the toilet for an hour and 44 minutes of my time and them wipe my butt with the seven dollars that got me in to this crap! That would have been a better use of my time and money. I should have listened to all of the other bad reviews of this movie!!!

722,webmistress-57,Deep Hurting,3,20 February 2008,"Caution: Wall of Text 1 centimeter ahead. Or 2 if you're set to 800x600.I will admit, very much, that I'm biased. I'm not remotely close to being a fan of the series, and I watched ""Eragon"" on a flight to London, so you can imagine the altitude was frying my brain a little. But I can say with complete honesty, and what I can remember of the film, that it looks a lot like Mystery Science Theater 3000 fodder of the 21st century. ""Eragon"" is, in a nutshell, Star Wars--farm boy thrust into a world of magic and adventure and danger at the hands of evil forces (Eragon/Luke), wise old mentor who trains the hero, but kicks the bucket and leaves the hero on his own (Brom/Obi Wan), handsome rogue with questionable motives (Murtagh/Han), beautiful princess who needs rescuing from evil forces (Leia/Arya), uncle who is mercilessly slaughtered by evil forces (Garrow/Owen), the evil forces themselves (Galbatorix/Vader)--set in a Lord of the Rings-ish fantasy land, with rolling expanses of mountains and vast plains and other terrain we saw in Fellowship, complete with pseudo-orcs (""urgals"", if you can believe that). And it's not just the rip-off factor that helped me to understand why it got the RiffTrax treatment. The dialog is cheese-tastic, and that's putting it gently. Poor Jeremy Irons as a very bored Galbatorix delivers one of the cheesiest of the lines: ""I suffer without my stone. Do not prolong my suffering."" It wasn't just the line, it was the delivery, he sounded like his next line was ""alright, I said it, now give me my paycheck."" Some more scriptwriter brilliance: ""I've got skills!"" says Eragon. ""Into the sky, to win or die!"" says Eragon. ""I am Saphira. And you are my rider."" says Saphira. I'm not going to be dramatic about it and say ""argh, this hurt my ears and made me gouge out my eyes with a spork!"" but I actually felt embarrassed for the actors involved in this film. It also, as other reviewers probably pointed out, goes pretty far from the source material, no doubt angering fans. ""Eragon""'s blatant rip-offness and two-hour supply of really, really goofy dialog is like one big expensive insult to the audience's intelligence.So yes, there's my two cents. It's hardly worth buying because it will likely end up in the bottom of your DVD pile. If you really want to give it the MST3k treatment, I'd suggest renting it. Perhaps ""Eragon"" would be enthralling for younger kids, maybe for some delusional fans, and for masochistic movie viewers like me, but I would definitely not recommend this to anyone over age ten.",Eragon
723,FranknFurterH-1,Disappointing Waste of Time,1,3 February 2007,This movie was not even worth the $3 paid in a second-run theater. I read the book and enjoyed it much! I felt the storyline was rich and the characters were deep; so needless to say I was so excited to see the movie.The actors were horrible (which is sad to say as most of the cast are very accomplished stars) and the story was so butchered that I found my self getting angry over the poorly written/delivered lines and choppy plot. The screenwriter should have stuck more with the story and not left key elements to the book out. That's what made the story so epic and fun to follow. When I read the book I felt like I related to the characters and saw the scenery. This film was just too distant and unattached to the novel. I nearly walked out!

I am surprised that Christopher Paolini approved this film. However, if they do Eldest, I hope they try to go by the book. Eragon looked too much like Lord of the Rings. At least the Harry Potter series go by the books and has J. K. Rowland's approval. This movie lacks character, strength,and any punch to it. If the actors had more input into the movie or dialog, then it might flow a little better or at the storyline might flow a little more. So my suggestion is to save your money and wait for the DVD to come out. Thanks for letting me express my opinion.",Eragon

Bad guys as well as good guys, the wicked king and his evil magician. A hidden hero, the son of whats his name. Overall, I think the movie was pure entertainment, it did not require that I think too hard just watch and enjoy. I will certainly be purchasing the DVD when it is released and look forward to any sequels that may be forthcoming.",Eragon
726,emelia2528,A very weak film in many ways,3,17 December 2006,"My daughter was enthusiastic about this movie, and still thought it was okay afterwards, but when an eleven-year-old can spot many weaknesses in the film, it's obvious there are big problems with Eragon. First, Mr. Irons is given far too little to work with while Mr. Malkovich essentially mails in his performance (what few lines he has, that is). Second, there are bizarre moments when a man on a horse manages to keep up with a boy on a dragon: if a dragon can't get from point A to point B faster than a horse can, what's the point of flying? Third, when major events (characters or plot) happened, there was inadequate lead-up to those events; instead, they just showed up on the screen willy-nilly. Fourth, the entire thing--characters, events, scenes, plot, you name it--seems to be patched together as if, instead of removing huge chunks of the book and making a decent movie out of the remains, the powers-that-be decided to put in everything in 1-2 minute snippets. Even people who have read the book (as my daughter and a friend did before going to the film) and are likely to have a great deal of good will going into the theater will find that good will severely strained.",Eragon
727,abigailoyedeji,The reason there were no more movies...,1,28 January 2020,"I have read all of the books. The crucial characters that were left out doomed the movie and potential sequels. The remaking of the plot of Eragon is not taking artistic liberties. There is no way that they characters could have beat out Galbatorix, united all species, or envoked the respect for the Varden that they neglected in this new interpretation of the book. They would have had to come up with different ways to kill the king and many other circumstances which is otherwise handed to them by the original creator, Paolini. I wish the Inheritance Cycle would transformed into a series. It has all of the juicy adventure that audiences would love.",Eragon
728,agigaride,Not Bad At All,6,28 December 2006,"Hi. I went to the theater today and saw Eragon (well duh, otherwise I wouldn't be writing this comment) and came on here to read what other people thought of it. I was stunned to find not one good comment in a gigantic trash pile of supposedly witty remarks and reasons on how the movie ""sucked"". I have not read the book myself (I know I'm going to get bombed for this in a reply later), but I thought the movie was totally awesome, and deserves to be acknowledged as a piece of cinematic art, despite the fact it is merely one and a half hours long or so, but who cares? I certainly don't, and look forward eagerly to the sequel.Maybe I shall read the book someday, just to see what you people are talking about. I look forward to your well-written protest messages in my in-box later, though I did not mean to offend anyone with this comment. Bye-bye.",Eragon

If you have not read the book, you would probably enjoy it more than if you have read the book. However, if you have not read the book, by the end of the movie you will be asking a lot of questions as the movie does not explain a lot of what actually happens. This is frustrating if you have read the book and expect to see certain things, which are not even mentioned in most cases. I would recommend this movie as long as you have not read the book. But if you do see this movie, read the book after as it is much better and will clear up a lot of questions that you are asking. If you have read the book go see it anyways, but a warning it does not include a lot of the book after Brom is introduced.",Eragon

In fact, I am in the middle of the second book by Christopher Paolini. ...But leave it to 20th Century Fox to screw up yet another film that could have been one of the big fantasy films of the year. This film was so slow-moving, so all-over-the-place in its plot, that I had no idea where they were going. Those who were followers of the book knew that they weren't faithful to Paolini's vision, and those who didn't read the book were left with their mouths gaping open going ""...Huh?"" Even the special effects were pretty crappy, after all the hush-hush about Saphira and how we weren't allowed to see her until just days before the movie's release....A HUGE two-thumbs down for this movie. I was so disappointed in it, I left the theater during the middle of the movie (The first time I had ever done so). I feel sorry for Christopher Paolini and the improbable destruction of his vision. He may be getting paid, but he'll be getting more ""boos"" than money.",Eragon
731,chloecleoohara,Good if you expect it to be bad,7,16 December 2006,"Having seen the film twice now(last night with my BF, today again with my father) I found two big differences between the two times.Having seen it last night, I was indifferent about it. I walked into the cinema, thinking 'Ok, this's SO gonna just be a complete disaster, don't expect it to be good' Watching it I was only slightly disappointed, finding they moved at too fast a pace and they mixed around a few things from the book E.G. The ending. People who asked if it was good or not, I told them it was nothing compared to the book(which I read a couple of months ago) but it was OK.Today, I found it was far more enjoyable. To those who have read the book - yes, OK, it's not very much like the book but it is still enjoyable if you let it be. A 500 page book filled with loads of events is not going to be fitted into a 2 hour long movie. No movie based on a book is going to be as good as the book. If you expect it to be, you will be disappointed each time.But anyway, today I found the movie was more enjoyable. I paid more attention to things and noticed some interesting stuff such as a few things said in a quieter tone by certain characters that added to things... and some other stuff I've already forgot. The movie didn't go as fast and things I thought happened so very fast seemed to be in the middle of the movie. I tried to ignore the mix-ups in some of the story lines and whenever there was a difference from the book I would just go 'Oh, that happened differently to the book' I laughed a little at some of the things said by characters(Mainly Brom ^^) and all in all I'm trying to say I enjoyed it more the second time because I knew it wouldn't be as good as it could be in comparison to the book. And yes, there was room for improvement, little things that could still fit in a 2 hour-2 and a half hour limit, but come on. They did well enough eh? Give the guys who attempted to make the movie a bit of credit, are any of you claiming you could do it better? Basically I advise that if you haven't seen it, regardless of whether or not you've read the book, go see it. If you like fantasy and can accept small mistakes I think you may just enjoy it like I did. Those who have seen it... if you like it, yay! If not, well that's your opinion.",Eragon
732,selfstudybuddy,So bad its funny,1,10 January 2007,"Eragon is one of the worst things I haver payed money to see. Its is so bad that the only that thing makes it worth watching is the fact that its hard not laugh at it. From the giant jelly been (a.k.a. ""dragon egg"") to the horse continually moving as fast or faster then the dragon, the movie is silly and the script and acting is at a level so low that would make Star Wars: Episodes I&II look like Kubrick Films. I have never read the books but I doubt anything could be as bad this drivel so I would guess most fans of the books would not enjoy the movie. The only reason one should see this movie is to loudly criticize its innumerable flaws with their friends. so in the end, I guess, I did get good laugh out of it...",Eragon
733,andyriley12,Not So Bad,6,17 December 2006,"After reading several reviews bashing the Eragon movie, I decided to go see it for myself. I have read the book, and I'm a big fan of the trilogy, and I have to say that, in my opinion, this movie is not as bad as some make it out to be. It's a pretty good fantasy film, and the special effects were kinda cool. You could tell that Fox spent some good money on this.Several things were different in the movie compared to the book, for instance, the journey traveled by Brom, Eragon, Arya, and Murtagh was cut down from over 200 pages of towns and deserts, to one town and a straight shot to the Varden. I actually liked the way they cut some of it down; it made more sense than spending hours going from event to event like it was written in the book.The best thing about this movie was Fox's ability to stress the overarching theme of strength and courage. That was somewhat expressed it the book, but the film really hit it hard with raw emotions. Ed Speleers did an excellent job in his role, especially considering it was his first and the Eragon character is extremely difficult to portray. His character development was very evident throughout the movie -- you could really see how Eragon changed from a farm boy to a dragon rider.Only two or three things bothered me about the film. First, Eragon is fifteen, not seventeen. The author specifically says that to express Eragon's youth and maturity level in the book. Also, Saphira seems to grow up in an instant after her first flight. That never happens with dragons. And the final thing. At the end of the movie, Arya leaves without Eragon to go back to her queen. Eragon is supposed to go with her to finish his training. I don't know they're going to fix that when they do Eldest.Overall, I really enjoyed this movie. Fox managed to keep many important scenes in the story and not completely butcher the plot. I would definitely recommend this.",Eragon
734,rge4,"""could have been a contender""",7,17 December 2006,"I think that this movie was trying so hard not to be even associated with LOTR (i.e. the journeys) that it lost its heart, and character developing capabilities.The journey with Aarya and Murtagh and Orik was completely overlooked,as was Rohrans own journey.(Excuse me for the spelling of the characters names.) It has been a while since I read the books. Overall the movie was entertaining and the dragon scenes were all top notch, and that was what I worried most about. Part 2 or ""ELDEST"" needs to develop the characters more because they have the special effects down.The movie was decent but it left out so many intriguing plot points and characters that it could have been exponentially better. TO sum up; this movie has a lot of untapped potential",Eragon
735,smr0406,disappointed,3,22 December 2006,"I read the book almost a year ago. I enjoyed it very much, I got the sequel the day it came out. The movie was an insult to the book. As far as the cinematics, the acting with the exception of two or three characters, was mediocre. The special effects were probably the highlight to the film. The soundtrack didn't match the film...Avril Lavigne for credit music?! Nothing against Avril. She's a babe. And most importantly, the relation to the storyline can be described as watching the Titanic (3 hours) as a short film under 8 minutes. See this movie after reading the book just to feel like you could have done a better job. Terrific book, ""not-so-much"" movie.",Eragon
736,Collosus1234,"Not Terrific, but good nonetheless",8,18 December 2006,"I cannot give this movie a perfect because it does not deserve perfect. Nor can I give it near perfect. I can say that I enjoyed this movie thoroughly despite the fact that half the book was missing. Normally I would attribute that to the fact that when you make a movie out of a book you cannot use it all, but when the movie doesn't even reach the two hour mark with so much missing something more could be done. I would also like to say that while it is missing an incredible amount of the story it does have its own good points. Try to forget there is even a book. Try to picture it by itself with no other information to go on. It is a good movie by itself. I enjoyed watching the movie and I did not compare it to the book the entire time I watched it. I suppose I can attribute it to the fact that my memory has more holes than a sieve and therefore I could not remember much of the book anyway, but I like to think that it was good regardless.",Eragon
737,barbarella_15,Not an epic film as expected,3,25 December 2006,"I was so excited to see this movie, but it was such a disappointment. Epic it was not. It was a disgrace to the book. I would have liked to see the characters actually develop. My son described it as an hour and fifteen minute trailer. I couldn't describe it better. That is exactly how it played. I expected bigger battle scenes, the journey to be longer to understand the characters. Some of the characters were never really introduced such as Ahjihad. I considered him a major character in Eragon being the leader of the Varden. There was also a lack of emotion. The only thing I did enjoy was Saphira, but even then I wish a better bond was created between her and Eragon. I would almost say, wait for it to come to video, but only if you have a free rental.",Eragon
738,ali_mealing,"Eragon - not so bad as other reviewers would have you think. Go on, go see it, make up your own mind...",9,31 December 2006,"Maybe I'm the only one who actually liked this movie, but I thought it was fun and fairly true to the book (even if some characters and story lines were cut)personally I hope they carry on with the rest of the trilogy! OK we've all been spoilt with the likes of LOTR, Star Wars, Harry Potter and Narnia, but the Eragon trilogy has it's place too. I just wish I could have written such good work when I was in my mid teens - all of the above authors were considerably older when they were first published so perhaps we ought to be a little kinder to Christopher Paolini?! Like most people, my only complaint was Arya lack of elven ears (my dad didn't realise that she was meant to be an elf until I mentioned it to him.) I guess you could also say that she lacked what many would classify as Elven qualities - wisdom and knowing power/strength etc.I do wish the movie had been a little longer, so that certain parts of the journey hadn't seemed such a blur; but like with any movie you understand the need to keep the story moving.Great afternoon's entertain, maybe it won't be remembered as a classic, but go see it anyway and make up your own mind.",Eragon
739,fmaltez,Eragon...not so good has it could be,5,17 December 2006,"I agree with somethings of the first comment. Get Peter Jackson or ask for some pointers so that you won't mess up ""Eldest"". It's a great trilogy (the books...) and, just like LOTR, they can be great movies but the director needs to do more effort. The actors weren't bad in my opinion (maybe sometimes but in general they were good) but the way the movie was made was terrible. This movie doesn't even has 2 hours!! With the books that big it should have the size of LOTR, there are many important details that don't appear, all the scenes are small and everything happens very fast. There are things we won't understand in the next movie, it's so fast that Jeremy Irons seems to die almost in the beginning, we didn't even see him being trained and learning elfish and the battle was to fast and not like the book at all...he doesn't even get the scar...I just hope they correct this mistakes in the second because it can really be a great movie but don't cut so many things.",Eragon
740,alexwall77,Worth a rental,7,6 June 2008,"Although this is a quality movie with a budget and fantastic CGI special effects, as well as reasonable acting it really needed to be about 20 minutes longer. The director cut out so much plot from the book that you feel as though you come away with a vaguely dissatisfied feeling.The problem with fantasy movies is that they must spend time introducing the fantasy world before one can suspend disbelief or feel as though they care what happens.The dragon and the dragon's voice are wonderful. The aerial photography is fantastic. The movie is definitely worth a watch and is not deserving of being panned. Nonetheless, it falls short.",Eragon

You know, big armies battling against terrible foes, etc.Some did it well, others not so much. Eragon is one of the latter.Special effects are well done, the dragon is kind of cute and maybe there's too much explosions to my taste.It's just characters don't seem to be real. While in LOTR I could nearly feel the emotions of Frodo, in Eragon it's not the case. It's like the actors are playing their role without understanding it.Boris",Eragon
742,gummymon2001,People don't give any movies enough credit anymore,5,27 December 2006,"Let me just say that I've never read the books, so maybe this discredits my opinion of the movie, though I don't think it does.I'm not saying this movie was Oscar-worthy material -- but it wasn't horrible. The special effects and scenery were absolutely beautiful, and the casting of Rachel Weisz as Saphira the dragon was genius. Saphira was a great character and Weisz really gave her personality. Jeremy Irons was fantastic as Brom, and Robert Carlyle was genuinely creepy as Durza, the Shade and villain of the movie.A lot of people are down on Edward Speelers (Eragon) but I thought he did a good job for his first movie. It takes a lot to act with a CGI character that obviously isn't going to be there as you film, and you have to give him credit for that. Garret Hedlund was great as Murtagh (who really should have had more screen time). Ditto for John Malkovich as Galbatorix.I've seen this movie twice already and will probably buy it on DVD, and I admit that the second time I saw it, there were parts I just wanted to skip over. I thought the beginning was pretty boring and the fight scene was lame and too drawn out, despite the incredible CGI and shots of Saphira and Eragon. However, the interaction between Brom and Eragon and the character of Saphira more than made up for this.I think if they had gotten a better script, this movie would have been so much better. The script was the worst thing about the entire movie, which is a shame, because obviously the movie couldn't survive without a script. From what my sister explained to me, they left out really important parts of the book and I really don't know why they couldn't have included those, instead of all of the ridiculous supposed ""sexual tension"" between Arya and Eragon, and the scene with Angela the fortune teller. I know Angela was a big character in the book, but if they had chosen to cut out her entire plot significance, they should have cut her out from the movie entirely and included more important things. It would have made the movie more enjoyable, even to people who have never read the books like me, and would have increased the possibility of a sequel to Eragon.Just because a movie has things wrong with it doesn't make it a horrible movie. Since I haven't read the books I'm obviously going to think of the movie in a different way than everyone else, but there are good and bad things about this movie and it's stupid to just focus on the bad things, like how you ""wasted your money"" going to see it. With all the stupid plot less comedy movies that are cropping up these past few years, it's nice to watch a movie with amazing CGI and be entertained by something other than fart jokes.A movie doesn't have to be Oscar-worthy to be good and it doesn't have to be Razzie-worthy to be bad. I think Eragon falls somewhere in the middle.",Eragon

744,ladyviola_21,Thoroughly enjoyable,7,30 December 2006,"Confession: I never read the book, never even heard about it until this movie came out. From the other comments I read, the book and the movie are quite dissimilar, so apparently I'm going to be very unhappy once I read the book.However, I found this movie thoroughly enjoyable, I found the plot easy to follow, the CGI wonderful, and the script moving. I was completely engrossed in the film, and all members in my party left praising the film.There are three main reasons I gave this film a 7 out of 10.1. While I normally like John Malcovich, I found his acting to be somewhat unbelievable; he seemed more like a mentally ill person without their meds rather than an evil king that the audience should fear.2. The set and costumes seemed to be ripped off of Lord of the Rings. Watching them was like seeing another story set in Middle Earth, especially when they approach the hidden city, which looked just like Gondor in ROTK.3. The plot was extremely predictable. I get the director wanted us to think such things as the egg being a ""stone"" and Brom just being some drunk nutcase instead of a Dragon Rider, but it was like they tried to cover it up so much that it just made it more obvious.So my advice is to judge for yourself by gathering all sides. Maybe you won't like it if you read the book, as others seem to be saying. But as someone coming from never having heard of it, loved the movie, and I'm going back to see it again.",Eragon
745,madmodder35,Horrible.,3,27 December 2006,"This movie..I thought it was a waste of my time and money. Sure, if you want to go see an ""epic"" movie about dragons chocked full of corny battle lines and horrible acting, this movie is for you! Although this would be a good movie to keep the kids busy for a couple hours, it's definitely not for the strictest critics or the most hard core movie buffs. This movie was mildly entertaining, it had it's parts, and one of the characters looked a helluva lot like Ozzy, so that was a plus. I thought this movie moved a little too fast. One scene a character would say ""No, Eragon! You're not strong enough!"" and in the next scene you would see Eragon doing what he was ""not strong enough"" to do. This movie didn't give a good reference as to the passage of time and it ended up being rather confusing.(I checked the little ""If you write a spoiler..."" box even though I'm not sure if I did or not...This is my first movie review so i really didn't know.)",Eragon
746,darthlew-1,"Bad Movie, waste of time, waste of money",1,19 December 2006,"Wow, Eragon is a bad movie. (What follows contains no plot spoilers)The least the studio could have done was try to rip-off the Lord of the Rings. This requires good casting and good acting, Eragon has neither. This requires careful costume design with cultural meaning, Eragon has neither. This requires experienced cinematography with unique location shooting, Eragon has neither. This requires holistic managing and direction, Eragon has neither. This requires an audience to feel emotion and suspension of disbelief, Eragon has neither. This requires careful story adaptation and design preproduction, Eragon has neither. This requires studios to hand over thoughtful control and embrace art, Eragon exhibits neither. This requires hiring a director with experience, vision, passion, critical eye, knowledge, education, storytelling ability, and a little luck; the director of Eragon has none of these traits. Could an extended cut help? Yes, some parts need much more time to translate into actual story. Unfortunately much of the final cut should be deleted, like 80 percent (that is being kind and understanding to human error). So what we have is a movie that is 20 percent of something. Hopefully the studio doesn't make more than 20 percent of their investment back. Perhaps there is a good 20 minute movie in there somewhere, though it probably exists in unused material. For little pay, I'd be willing to lend my editing knowledge and experience to the studio and salvage something out of this mess of bad choices and wrong decisions and poor production. 20th Century Fox, my gauntlet has been thrown.",Eragon
747,addo_07,Fantastic!,10,29 December 2006,"I can't believe all these people who have said terrible things about the film! I went to see Eragon with my Dad for his birthday, we have both read the book, and both really enjoyed the film. What we as an audience have to understand that it is a film BASED ON the novel by Christopher Paolini. I am a young actor, and looking at it from an actors point of view i thought that the performances from the actors were far from lack-lustre and boring as they have been described as by other users. Jeremy Irons and John Malkovich both give fantastic performances, but by far the best performance is given by Robert Carlyle as Durza: Absolutely spine-tingly! Yes the boy playing Eragon wasn't as good as he could have been, but his performance within the context of the film isn't particularly bad. This film for me thoroughly brightened up an otherwise dull December day! I'd see it again any day!!!",Eragon
748,amillsey,Why the bad reviews?,9,14 December 2006,"Reviews of Eragon, particularly from critics, have been very mixed, and I went to see this movie with mixed feelings of anticipation and apprehension. Thanfully, only the first was justified. Ed Speleers is great as the eponymous hero, delivering a performance in-keeping with his character. Jeremy Irons is brilliant as Brom (but what else can you expect?) and Robert Carlyle is as creepy a villain as you could hope for. Of course, certain elements from the books are disregarded to ease the transition to film, but they do not interfere with the flow of the story. The scenery is spectacular, the sets stunning, the acting (mostly) stellar and the special effects awesome. My one sticking point is in the casting of Galbatorix and Ajihad, two characters who need the most charisma, yet John Malkovich and Djimon Honsou are very wooden in their delivery. A good all-round international casting broke up the monotony I deplore in most movies where the villain is English and the hero American - in this case, the hero(es) are English, one of the villains is American and the other is English. I don't know if it was intentional or not, but this conveyed some of the far-reaching arm of Galbatorix. This movie is no 'Lord of the Rings' or 'Harry Potter', nor does anyone have any right to compare them. Eragon is its own movie, despite the current trend for fantasy films. Those who aren't fans of the books will be able to appreciate it as well as those who are. A triumph for all involved.",Eragon
749,ApiratesLyfeme,This is NOT what anyone would've expected,1,16 December 2006,"This movie does not deserve any awards. The first time I saw the preview, I knew it was a terribly filmed movie. The director wanted the movie to look foreboding and dark, but it was done in a very inexperienced way. The characters were not casted according to their description, and the acting was not up to anyone's expectations. There was one part of the movie where the Urgals were attacking this group of travelers, and Eragon wanted to fight them, and Brom, his mentor asked him: ""you think you can do that??"" and Eragon was like ""I...have SKILLS!"" and literally everyone in the theater burst out laughing! I really think that the author, Christopher Paolini, was embarrassed by the horrible job that the director and cast members did. I would be.",Eragon
750,gigglesmile2001,I disagree with most.,8,29 December 2006,"Perhaps, what I saw in the movie was different because I read the book. I loved the book and even read the second part in the trilogy. I'm also anxiously awaiting the third portion. I'll admit Malcovich's performance was mediocre as was Iron's but as for the young Eragon, as a first timer, I'd say he did rather well.The movie left a lot to the imagination and the effects were more than superb. Saphira's character and animation effects were incredible. There was a lot that was left out from the book, which is what I really didn't like. The movie definitely sets the premise for the next two sequels to follow and hopefully, they will justifiably portray the character growth that occurs in the novels. I didn't think the movie did the book justice but there was immense potential, that was masked by the beautiful scenery and filming.The movie does well sharing with the audience, the magic of dragons and the special bond that ties the dragons and their riders. I also think that there should have been more use of magic but I also know, this is just the beginning of Eragon's journeys and adventures with Saphira. The directors could have explained the history of Alagaesia a bit more with more conviction and passion. The problem with the movie is that there's so much of the story to tell.Overall, the movie should be seen with an open mind. Don't expect anything, going in and let the magic and wonder take over. Imagine what it would have felt like to be in Eragon's shoes. Let yourself be captivated by this movie and fly, for the first time on the wings of a dragon. For those, who have already seen the movie and don't like it. I urge you to read the book and remember that it was written by a young fifteen year old. It truly is a magical work of words.",Eragon

I was looking at the movie if I read the book I don't want to look the movie.So the movie is for this type of movies one of the best.

752,mrspam32,Not a waste of time....,9,27 December 2006,"I liked the movie. The acting was a little dry. Jeremy Irons and Rachael Wiesz gave very talented performances.Sound effects were good, the use of jet plane passes instilled a sense of speed to the flight of the dragon. The CGI effects were done very well. There seemed to be little to no flaw in the connection of the CGI images and the live actors touching them. Costumes and sets were well put together without trying too hard, but we never got to get a good look and feel for the environment they were in.My only real complaint is that it was not a very gripping presentation. At times, I found myself wandering through different thoughts. Good story, I'll be excited to see the next two, as well maybe check out the books. I just think the direction could have been a bit less direct in terms of developing the story and more focused on Eragon and Saphira's development together.Also, as a music teacher and home theater specialist I found the music score a bit understated and uninteresting.",Eragon

And in immersed in an adventure of epic proportions as that blue stone turns out to have hatched a dragon. He becomes the world's last hope as he becomes the new dragon rider. A dragon rider has the ability to have conversations with his dragon (through their minds) and use magic. Magic is basically as strong as the will you have in your body. Many cities are visited and many creatures are seen like the Urgals (spiraled horned creatures) Razaacs (cloaked beaked creatures) dwarfs and elves. Now Eragon, the movie, is a horrible piece of garbage. Eragon, played by Edward Speleers, looks like he has never did any farm work a day in his life. Arya, the elf played by Sienna Guillory, was supposed to be unconscious throughout most of the first book. But yet she has a big part in the movie. Murtagh, Garrett Hedlund, actually trains in combat with Eragon in the story. In the movie they barely converse with one another. Roran, Christopher Egan, goes off to work in order to be able to support a live with the woman he loves, Katrina. In the movie, she's not even introduced, or mentioned, and Roran gives the excuse that he's leaving to serve in the army. During the scene when Eragon flies in the air for the first time, it is supposed to be snowing and he gets badly cut on his thighs by Saphira's scales. Sadly the whole movie took over in a span of three days, when the book takes a course of about a year. The Urgals, which are supposed to be horned demon like creatures are, in the movie, men with face paint. The Razaacs, which are cloaked beak like creatures, were a cross between Predator and the Mummy. King Hrothgar is the king of the dwarfs, in the movie his name is not even mentioned and he looks just like another person. The Urgals, Dwarfs, and Elves look just like regular people. And my girlfriend caught this goof, Arya is an elf, but she is wearing leather boots. Elves, as we learn in the second book, respect all living life and do not eat meat. Why in the world is she wearing leather? So much was spliced together and it was worse than I thought it would be, because I am a huge fan of the book. I read it just a year ago and read the sequel last summer. There were so many unnecessary changes some of them quite major and also changes that affected the sequel to Eragon making it useless. I hope to everything that is good and pure that this movie gets pulled from theaters and they banned Stefen Fangmeier from directing a possible sequel. I'm just glad that I read this wonderful book first, cause if I had to just base my Eragon experience on that garbage, then I would not have bothered trying to read the book.",Eragon
754,Razgriz20,Just read the books!!,1,17 December 2006,"OK i watched this last night and.... well its hopeless.One could bash this movie from many points of view, but there are so many ways in which this film fails, that it would take a huge amount of time to explain them all.Ill just say: Bad acting, apart maybe from Rachel Weisz as Saphira and Jeremy Irons as Brom, the talent of John Malkovich was wasted in this movie.Bad world, the world one reads in the book gives the idea that it is much more interesting and pretty, both in terms of characters and places.And to finish this comment: The creators of this movie didn't read the bloody book!!! Where are the dwarfs? Where are the elves? Where are the events that happened in the book?? So i leave the advice - read the books, destroy the movie.",Eragon
755,valentinvejvoda,About the film Eragon.,10,30 January 2007,"The film is very good.First I have read the book(s) and then saw the film.Films aren't so good as the books but this is always the same because of our own imagination.I was positive surprised how good Eragon is because so many people had told me, that the film Eragon isn't so good.The locations in the film were very good, like mountains.It would be interesting or good if some places like the mountain scene were in Austria.There are so beautiful and desolate places and they were ideal for films like Eragon and other fantasy movies.The actor's are very good, they are the flittest for the film.I'm curious about the second film, which is coming in next years time. Film was so good,that I mean that every person should see it.The Soundtrack was also very good.I bought the CD some days ago and in some month the DVD.At the moment I can't say more about the film.Later I will make a new comment.Sorry for my bad English.I was always not very good at it. Sorry for my comment.Isn't very good or illuminative.It's the first comment from me and I don't know how to make a good or illuminative comment.In future I will learn it.Vali",Eragon
756,jkayteag,I owe somebody an ass whippin',1,12 January 2007,"for this movie. If I wanted to see an idiotic, childish conglomerate of every fantasy film ever made, and a cheesy teen with a dorky smile and no acting talent in the starring role, I'm sure I could have seen it at some pimple infested, b.o. laden, high school gym for free. Who the hell is responsible for this ""film""??? Don't let me catch you on the street, you pathetic, talentless, piece of ass lint. Attn: Ed Speelers. I hear they're hiring at Walmart, why don't you put in an application? You're ""acting"" career is not going to last. Attn: Jeremy Irons? Stop making stupid movies. You're an excellent actor, with limitless talent, and you can do better than this. Maybe you need a new agent.",Eragon
757,lhill-7,book was better,5,20 March 2007,"I think this movie would have been enjoyable (but not great) if I had never read the book. I wonder if Christopher Paolini (the writer of the book) is disappointed with the movie. They cut out too many important details that are critical to the plot in the second book. I would much rather sit in the theater for four hours watching a great movie, which this had the potential to be, than to sit for two hours watching a crappy one. If they make a sequel, I will rent it but not go to the theater to see it. The CGI for Saphira was fantastic. She seemed very lifelike and fit into the scenery seamlessly. The story overall just seemed too rushed. I recommend the books but not the movie.",Eragon
758,mchandler1807,Worth 90 minutes of anyones time,7,19 December 2006,"I'd read bad reviews and people had told me not to go see this, but I did anyway. I was pleasantly surprised, the GCI (especially on Sahpira) we're very good, and the boy who played Eragon did a good job. Jeremy Irons was capable of so much more, but maybe he didn't read the book or really believe what he was saying was worth the effort! I don't actually think many people can have read the book who made this film as half way through it lost the plot and changed everything! Although big chunks were missed out and the story was lacking to me, I don't think anyone who hasn't read the book will spot the gaps. Not as serious or grown up as LOTR but if you're a fan of fantasy it will find a place in your heart. Spoiler to follow: Some of the huge bits they missed: The scar on Eragon's back, Eragon and Arya seem to be an item (not like the book when she's actually 100 years his senior!), what about the drearies at the end? The Raazac are all dead then? the Varden seem to have a very open mountain not jewel capped hollow! and his friend seems to have survived quite happily?!?!? and the ending of Eragon staying to look after the varden was nothing like the book!",Eragon
759,brycebyoung,"Never read the book, and I loved the movie.",8,7 September 2021,"The same happened for me with Harry Potter: All of my friends were super upset about the movie because it's not the book. They then made sure that I had the wrong idea based on their own feelings. However, I found the movie(s) to be great, and then went back and read the books to enjoy those too. Give it a chance, but maybe it helps if you don't know what you're missing/if you don't compare the movies purely to the books (they never fully equate in any series I know of, and can still be quality works of art in themselves).",Eragon
760,fiddlinchick27,don't waste your money!,1,16 December 2006,"I saw Eragon yesterday after a much waited and anticipated time. I was throughly disappointed in the movie, to the point that i almost walked out. But I am a cheap skate and wanted to at least finish it. And get a portion of what I paid for. If you have read the books, then DO NOT see the movie. The movie is a completely different story using the same characters. Shame on the directors and writers for not staying true to the books. You could have had another loyal following such as the LOTR fans but alas you chose to do your own thing and call it Eragon. I find that I usually do not agree with the critics on movies; however I agree that this one is a bomb. Five thumbs down!",Eragon
761,sashi_han,I tried not to hate this,1,15 December 2006,"Honest to God, I tried not to hate this movie. I would have walked out if I hadn't been babysitting. I read this book last year and I was so incredibly excited when the movie was coming out, so when I was babysitting this afternoon I decided to take the kids to this movie. After about half and hour I wanted to run out and watch The Pursuit of Happynes or get hit by a truck, whatever was closer, but maybe that was just because I read the book and it messed it up too bad for comfort. A plus was that small children find it quite entertaining, and I must admit, I found it very entertaining to hear them chat about it on the way home in the car. Other than that, I think it was a story that was poorly executed. I think you everyone should read the book and wait for the DVD.",Eragon
762,mockeleon,Beyond terrible..,1,14 December 2006,"I just got back from seeing this movie - and not only can I not understand how the film got into production, I cannot believe that human hands could create a film so devoid of purpose and quality that I would question society as a whole.There is not one aspect of this film that would give a normal person reason to compliment or enjoy this movie. The dialog is beyond understanding and the acting is mediocre at best.Worst of all, the film is devoid of all plot and not one scene in the film had any importance or relevance to the film as a whole. If a sequel is made my faith in humanity will be extinguished forever.",Eragon
763,james_lohman,Do Over,1,16 December 2006,"My only hope for this movie is that the movie makers realize what they have done to an excellent novel. The only thing the movie had right were the names of the characters. I was extremely disappointed in the transition to on screen as they did not even attempt to translate any of the original writings of Christopher Paolini into the script. There was a total lack of character development and there were characters that should have never even had screen time (King Galbatorix). I fear that they will attempt to make a movie out of Eldest and continue the downward spiral they have created. I call for a ""Do Over"", and bring in some people that know how to write a script, direct and throwing down some more money to make it would help. It's an adventure, not a quick story...put some thought into it and release it as a 3+ hour epic.",Eragon
764,maiden_of_the_battle,Not Great Conversion from Book to Movie - Not Impressed,6,16 December 2006,"As a fantasy (book and movie) lover, the plot of Eragon really stood out for me. I loved the books by Christopher Paolini and anticipated the release of the movie to the big screen for months. Well, I was disappointed. The movie left out some of my favorite parts of the book and my favorite character, in my opinion, was totally changed from book so that he did not really appear so appealing. I enjoyed the movie as the opener for a fantasy epic (Lord of the Rings is much better by far and Narnia might be too), but was very frustrated that is did not hold to the books. Actually, one might say it fit the book plots better than most books-to-movies, but I am still rather upset. I hope Eldest can fill in that gaps.",Eragon
765,skull_candy,It was great if you don't compare it to the book.,6,26 August 2007,"I thought it was pretty cool. I mean, if I compare it to the book, it's horrible, but just watching the movie without thinking about the book, it's quite good. All the graphics were good. Saphira looked great. The casting was great. Everything was great(except for leaving lot of parts from books). Ed Speeler did a great job playing Eragon. Brom was just perfect. A lot of people said it was not that good, but I'm glad I watched it. If I haven't read the book before the movie came out, the movie might have been a tad better, but really, they did a great job. It ended kind of weird, like they're going to make a sequel. If they do, I would like a bit longer movie with important parts in it.",Eragon
766,phq_bethel_19,Do not read the book and then see the movie,2,17 December 2006,"If you have read the book I recommend that this is the last movie you see. And those who have read the book and seen the movie, you will know just how crappy this movie is. This movie picked and chose what it added. Key characters for Eldest (second book) are removed, cities Eragon and Brom visit are removed and things that don't even happen are put into it.I saw this with a family member who lent me the book to read and I was expecting something big like LOTR, for I had seen the previews and thought it would be really good. It was the second day it was screening in Australia and there were at least 20 people in the cinema...I found that the opening sequence was alright. But as it got into the telling of the story, it started to get suck-y-er.The story moved so fast that unless you have read the books, you wouldn't know how fast it did. One day Eragon finds an egg, next he's being told to fly and being pushed southwards. No storyline or plot (as far as I can tell) at all!",Eragon
767,priscilabfischer,Read the book first,3,14 January 2007,"I read the book before I went to the cinema to see the film and I am glad I did so. The movie really let me down as it omits all those parts in which Christopher Paolini shows the magic word of The Inheritance trilogy. All in the movie happens so fast and if they are going to make the movie of Eldest I can see from now that it's not going to be much different from Eragon. They took off all magic of the wonderful relationship between Eragon and Saphira, thing that gives magic to this wonderful story.However, one can't deny that the special effects are good, and that Sephira is beautifully done. So my advice is first read the book please.",Eragon
768,Welshmano,way too short....,3,20 December 2006,"I read and liked the book. Yes, i know the story just combined Star Wars and LOTR, but i loved those series so i enjoyed the book. However.... A fantasy film, in my opinion, needs to be at least 2 - 2&1/2 hours long. There's no way you can fit in the vast history behind all fantasy adventures, and still have the film under 100 minutes! The film felt rushed from start to finish. The characters were under-developed, which meant you didn't care if they lived or died. No time was ever taken to explain what was going on, like how did the boy learn so much magic? how the hell did Brom's horse keep up with a dragon that could fly at a 100mph over mountainous terrain? why didn't the elves/dwarfs/urgals look any different from humans? And then there was a smoke dragon thingy, an addition that wasn't in the book...This was much more powerful than a real dragon! why would people care so much about dragon riders, when they can conjure a better one up themselves any time they want? It was ridiculous and unnecessary. Fangmeier should have just concentrated on special effects (which, in fairness, were good) and left the directing to someone who knew what they were doing. Avoid.... Just found out it was the scriptwriters second ever film! Honestly, for a budget of $100million, they shouldn't have trusted it to a rookie. I don't know what they spent that budget on, but it wasn't worth it!",Eragon
769,richard-1364,"Enjoyable movie, not as bad as some say, but with several problems...",8,3 December 2007,"*-WARNING, CONTAINS SPOILERS-*Even though I thought this movie was extremely unfaithful to the book, I did enjoy certain parts of it, which does make it at least worth checking out. For one thing, though I understand why people are angry at this, I thought it was a good idea to change the Ra'zac from hooded creatures to maggot-infested mummies for several reasons. Firstly, there has been some criticism with the Ra'zac being too like Tolkien's Ringwraiths, so changing them lessened this comparison. I think they look quite intimidating and their wrist blades were an interesting addition. Though I dislike them dying, it was very funny to see one of them strangled by a vine, I thought that was a great twist! Durza, in my opinion, was very well done. He looked just as I imagined and he created an aura of terror - his hellbeast was a great creation. Saphira, the best aspect of the film, no competition! She was an amazing creation and her voice really contained attitude! I also thought Brom was portrayed really well, Jeremy Irons did a great job! Unfortunately, these qualities are slightly displaced by the problems with the film. Orik, Hrothgar, Nausada and Angela had tiny, tiny parts - Orik and Nausada aren't named at all! Eragon does not hear the voice of Oromis in his head and Ellesmera is not mentioned, nor are Dras-Leona, Yazuac, Teirm or Helgrind, which will cause a problem if they make a sequel! The Urgals should have resembled the ones in the book and Tronjhiem should be inside a bloody mountain, for god's sake, not an exact copy of Minas Tirith!",Eragon
770,malabro,Eragon?,5,17 December 2006,"My apologies for my point of view, but for the few of us who saw this film because of the book, we just got a hit below the belt.Making things clear, one of the critic points of this movie is how forced it is. I don't know if they have a very short film time, or budget problems, but this movie needed A LOT MORE OF TIME. Some parts that needed some drama (Like the born of Saphira or Eragon meeting the varderns), just passed like simple filler shots.Ipso Facto, due to the short time of the film, the history is changed in ways that, well, even when they at least it can support the plot, is just way too twisted from the real deal.I may not be the best at selecting movies, but see this one with a real open mind, or else, you will only find a waste of money.",Eragon
771,shadowreflects,Lucky I gave it a 6...,6,16 December 2006,"Okay, so the movie wasn't terrible... But that doesn't mean it was great, either. The plot is basically a watered-down loose translation of the book, which is NOT what I expected, and also was on a much shallower scale. I've read the book 4+ times now, and I think I could summarize the book more accurately in an hour than the movie did in two. Many people were overlooked, Eragon's past wasn't explained well enough, much of the characters' personalities were skewed, and to top it off, it missed out on critical events (and actions) leading up to the second book.After watching the movie, I have to wonder how many people involved in the production actually read Eragon OR Eldest. Personally, I wouldn't recommend watching the movie until you have read the book, and even then only if you're brave enough to be let down.However, the movie by itself would be a decent movie, if there was no book to overshadow it. With all things considered, it could have been MUCH better, but also much worse. Next time, they should consult the author.",Eragon

I read the book a year or so ago and loved it, and this movie did not do it justice. Almost half of the book wasn't even in the movie! I mean, weren't there dwarfs in the book? And the dwarfs' crystal, the Twins, Murtagh's ""death"", and much more. I mean, how will they make a second movie if Murtagh is still alive? I thought the movie had excellent graphics and special effects, but the actual storyline was hard to follow, erratic, and choppy. The characters were not at all well developed, for example, when Brom died, it didn't matter all that much in the movie, because it was as if the viewer had just met him, but in the book, it was like Eragon's own father had died.

774,zen_blade,An Inheratance Trilogy Fan's Review.,7,17 December 2006,"First of all, I love Chris's Books... The movie, honestly, I was rather disappointed, amongst other fans. I know our Favorite Author had nothing to do with it, but it was too fasted paced, and the storyline was too cut up. What they DID need was: more TIME, bigger BUDGET, and new DIRECTOR. Especially the Director! Mr. Stefen Fangmeier, the man who directed the movie, is a Movie Special Effects Supervisor, and had never truly directed anything in his professional career, so this was a first for him. I am not so happy that he chose ERAGON as his practicing grounds. What? So he can prove his ""wonderfully talented"" and ""extraordinary"" directing and editing techniques. I having read the book, I expected something Epic, Like Lord of the Rings or Harry Potter, the book itself would make a really great film, but that is...if the Film stays true to the book. But this film is a joke, a spoof of the book. Christopher Paulini's books Deserved more justice that this. OK, that's enough from me. Like I said, I am in love with the books, I consider myself a true fan to the Book, but unfortunately, I cannot say the same thing about my loyalty with the Film.... (Although, I probably will end up Buy the DVD and I will especially look out for a hopefully REALLY REALLY extended edition of the DVD if it ever comes out.) So all you fans out there, at least buy the DVD, (which I know you will) to show your support. That's the least I can do for the film.",Eragon

The movie just doesn't do justice to the wonderful world Paolini has created. There are major characters missing, and other plot points, too. They knew Arya was a Princess, so someone must have read Eldest, but they left out Elva, The Twins, and Solembum. The order of things was different too. I'm also a Harry Potter fan, so I knew the movie wouldn't be perfect, and it wasn't. However, the acting, I thought, was wonderful. It was exactly the way I saw Brom speaking. If it would have been just a movie and not an adaptation, it would have been quite good. Over all, I liked it, but they can't expect to make a sequel without introducing the characters in the second movie, when there's already enough content. I just wish Paolini himself could have directed, but I also want the third book done.",Eragon

The movie however is one of the worst I have ever seen! To be honest, the only similar things between the two are the character's names. Other than that, they twist every event from the book to the point that every time something happens you end up saying,""That's not how it happened!"" And sometimes you say, ""That didn't even happen!"" If I could give this movie zero I would. Low budget, no famous actors, this move could have been like Lord of the Rings, but no, they just settled for a badly made cash cow! We need a re-make like with the Hulk.",Eragon
777,dramajuana,A terrible movie based on a fantastic book,2,19 December 2006,"I read both Eragon and Eldest, and re-read Eragon the day before I was invited to see the film. A friend of mine works at a theater, so we were able to get free tickets. I was a little wary about the film before I saw it because Eragon looks like he's about 20 (he's 19). In the film, he says he's 17. In the book, it says he's 15. Okay, I can deal with that. However, the order of things bothered me-nothing was in the right order, and the fact that Brom and Eragon only traveled together for like a week. Brom was supposed to be teaching Eragon how to spar and use magic, and things like that, but he just did a lot of yelling. And why could Eragon do magic so well intuitively? They skipped Joed's entire thing, Angela was weird and too young, and Roran left home because they were looking for soldiers? What? They skipped so much that hardly anything made sense. Eragon said (in the book and the movie) that he hardly recognized himself. But the movie didn't allow him to grow at all, since it seemed to have taken place in a week.Problems with order: Brom didn't die until after Arya was rescued (Murtagh is supposed to be with Eragon when Brom dies and help him through it), and Arya helped get Brom out after Durza threw a spear into him (Brom should have been dead at the time, Eragon a prisoner himself, and Murtagh and Saphira were going to rescue HIM and he wanted to rescue Arya.. oh yeah, and Arya was supposed to be drugged and unconscious). Oh, and Gallbatorix didn't want Eragon and Saphira killed; he wants to convince them to join him. Also, at the close of the book, Ajihad is supposed to be dead and Murtagh and the Twins (how could they skip the twins and the testing of Eragon?!) are supposed to be missing (presumed dead). EDIT: Just realized that this is incorrect. That doesn't happen until the beginning of the SECOND book. I'm sorry. I guess I was confused because Arya was leaving, and she doesn't leave in Eragon, the book /EDIT Oh, and why does Arya encourage Eragon's infatuation in the movie? Also, why was Brom so mean? He's supposed to be this secretive mentor who's strict and caring and kind. In addition, Eragon is WAY too full of himself.Oh, a couple more complaints: why did Saphira magically grow in two minutes when she was flying? And what was up with Brom just burning Garrow? And with Eragon just ripping Brom's glove to go ""oh, look. A gedwey ignasia. You're a rider."" Wasn't Brom supposed to reveal that when he was on his death bed? And after he had become like a father to Eragon, instead of an annoying jerk. One thing I DID like (oh my!) was the poetic license taken with Brom dying on Saphira's back. That's totally something she would do.The movie was choppy and I can't imagine that it made sense to anyone, including the people who never read the book. Nothing is explained, and so much poetic license was taken it's not even funny. I can't understand why they didn't take 3 hours to make it make some sense, instead of the measly hour and half. It's not exactly a movie for little children anyway, so they shouldn't have worried about time, and it really could have been great. I was sorely disappointed. I am VERY glad that I did not have to pay to see this movie. If you haven't seen it yet, don't. The book is a great read, and it goes very fast. You won't want to put it down, and you'll be sad that there isn't more when you're done. But then you can read Eldest!",Eragon

So, I won't give it the ""1"" rating it deserves.The book itself was not great. Eragon was basically a plagerized version of Tolkien's work and a none-moving standard fantasy book. I yawned all the way through the novel and found myself asking, ""why did I buy it?""Sure, I had read worse, but I only read the book because I heard the author wrote it at 15. I thought at the time, ""Why, not? How bad could it be? I always give new authors, and especially self-published ones a try.""Ugh. Waste of time and money. Well, I guess this dragon-stuff and reading standard boring fantasy novels just isn't my ""cup of tea.""

779,quickcell79,more of a kids movie,5,9 January 2007,I thought this movie would be much better than it was. Maybe that why I didn't really care for it too much. It wasn't that it was a bad story or a bad film at all. It just seemed to be more of a kids film. But i'm sure there are plenty of people who would disagree. But thats my opinion. The film was just to long and slow for my taste. Most of it was spent watching the boy be hardheaded an sloppy. the big stuff doesn't seem to come until the end and by then I was just praying for it to be over already so I could go home. But like I said I'm sure if I were ten years younger I would have thought it to be the greatest movie in the world. But as far as I'm concerned Narnia was a much better film and I also considered that to be more of a kids film.,Eragon
780,icehotfire,This movie was highly rushed and unfaithful to the original book's plot.,2,16 December 2006,"I have many a problem with this movie. First of all, I read the book first and it was amazing, so i went into the theater with high expectations. I was almost immediately disappointed. The plot was extremely mangled, leaving out nearly half the book, swapping events, and giving important characters literally seconds on the screen (Angela the herbalist, Orik the dwarf). Secondly, the whole thing seemed rushed, and appeared to have taken place in about 1/16 of the time in the book, with Eragon making split second decisions for no apparent reason and then sprinting off. It would have been so much better had the director decided to lengthen the film to at least 2 hours. Sadly, also, it was watered down for the under-12 set (hence the PG rating) so it lost some of the gusto during the battles that were so fascinating in the book.",Eragon
781,stephi91,this movie was pretty good!,8,19 February 2007,"I liked it.... bit of a rip off from lord of the rings... but still good. its funny how everybody finds something to complain about....if its not the plot, its the actors and their acting, if its not the directors its the effects and so forth. so if the lord of the rings series was a little over powering, try Eragon. it was pretty good. but in relation to others comments about the acting being absolute sh*t , i didn't find it sh*t at all! so whatever movie your going to see or want to watch don't listen to movie critics or people who can't find anything bad about the movie so make some stuff up, go see it! what ever floats your boat!!!oh and i was just reading other peoples comments about how the book was so different, so much better than the movie......its exactly the same as the harry potter series .... your safe so long as you haven't read the book. but i do have to say they did cut out too much of the book and focused too much on the little things rather than the important parts!! it isn't such a let down unless you've read the book because you don't know what your missing out on. how ever i still enjoyed the movie but the books were better!",Eragon
782,johnsonsecret,One and done for Fangmeier and the Eragon trilogy? My questions and complaints...,1,17 December 2006,"Will anyone ever let Fangmeier direct another film after this tragedy? I have now seen this movie from start to finish twice, and I would describe the result as the three most uncomfortable hours of my life not spent in the immediate presence of rotten garbage or a fresh dirty diaper. It pains me to write this slight review. I will whole-heartedly admit that I did not expect this movie to be very good. I grew up in reading novels that were poorly translated onto the big-screen and have learned to expect the worst since my experiences in the 1990's. However, a recent slew of well-adapted classics had given me the hope that I might not have to endure another literary work that I enjoyed reading as much as this one botched to this degree.Speaking of classics, as a novel, I would label neither Eragon nor Eldest in this manner, but, then again, there are not too many classic novels written for the young-adult audience by virgin males under the age of 23. Paolini's writing style is raw, underdeveloped, and extremely dirrivative. He might have created the lamest combination of names, fauna, geography, and language ever employed in a fantasy novel. It is not extremely fair to prod into the source of his failure in these categories, since Tolkien and Lewis are mostly to blame for nearly exhausting the limits of the fantasy genre before the 1960's were through. I will just flatly state that Paolini failed miserably in the pursuit of distinguishing his world from those utilized by previous authors. Despite all of this, Eragon and Eldest are still enjoyable fantasy reads. Beneath the soil of clichés, Paolini buried a solid exploration of the ""coming of age"" phenomenon occurring in adolescent males as well as a plot, minus the fantasy elements, which rivals that of good episode of C.S.I. There is a believable amount of ambiguity written into the novels as well as a major heap of character development. Unfortunately, the redeeming qualities of the novel were dropped in favor of the most generic. Without the complete void in the development of the support roles and the obviously hard work to keep the screen-play on a 3rd grade reading level the director and screen-writer achieved a work with less emotional depth than a LaToya Jackson album.This might be the ultimate fan-boy disaster in terms of an adapted screen-play, some of the omissions are akin to the possibility of ommiting Helen from a story about the Trojan war. Visually, the movie avoided anything that would have given you much of a feel for a fantasy world. I have to assume that the budget for this flick was less than the budget for a season of South Park.Ugh, I have a lot more to say, but I will go ahead and gag any comments specifically related to this movie, and instead turn my focus toward the careers of the three people responsible for this cinematic tragedy.First, Stefen Fangmeier... it is unfortunate that this man, who has contributed some good work in the realm of visual effects, was given a movie of this profile level kick off his career as a director. It was obvious that he cut and pasted the story to highlight the relatively horrendous visual effects in this movie. Every choice he made for this film is debatable... just like anyone else ever making the choice to slate him as a director for another feature that wasn't a mini-series or straight to video would be debatle. I think there were episodes of Xena that utilized more directoral skill than this film.Second, Peter Buchman... I think most serious viewers would readily admit that in addition to being completely unnecessary, Jurassic Park III told one of the lamest re-hashed stories ever. I feel sorry for those people who idolize Che, as this man is wielding the pen that will determine how he is portrayed on-screen. If it's anywhere close to his first two credited works, Che will be granted the emotional constitution of the Tin Man.Thirdish, John A. Davis/Wyck Godfrey as unbelievable as it may sound, these two actually devalued their net work with this production. Davis has some successful work under his belt, and hell, even though this movie is pitiful, it may still end-up making dollars and cents once the cash is all sorted out. He's definitely one of those ""garbage-men"" type of producers... you can expect to see his name on a film that is going to play it as safe as possible and meet the minimum requirements for art, but he won't be going out on a limb any time soon. Wyck is still kind of new in the realm of production, but this is easlity the worst thing with his name on it so far. I feel for him.still disgusted and tired of writing...",Eragon
783,erikbouwhuis,"If you read the book, you will hate this...",5,17 December 2006,"The first thing to comment on this movie, is that the cinema was almost empty (± 15 people), I went with 6 friends of mine, 1 who also read the book. After the movie, the other 5 also want to read the book, and they also find the movie wonderful.I read the book, and I didn't like the movie, this because of the huge plot-changes in the movie (e.g.: no dwarfs, NO ORIK, Arya without black hair etc.). When I watched the movie as a not-reader, I loved it, this was due to the nice graphics and the nice casting (except for the freaky fetish-leather-trousers they carried) Ed Speleers did a nice job acting in the movie (the girls will love him :P) And Robbert Carlyle was the best casted person in this movie, he was pretty freaky (thanks to the grime).All this together makes me give this movie a 6 out of 10, although I think the not-readers will give it a higher vote.Erik Bouwhuis",Eragon
784,SaphiraStar_x3,Good but cut,8,17 December 2006,"I really liked the movie...there were good actors...good effects...and it was a good plot. But for fans of the book...the plot was cut. There were many things that happened in the book that didn't happen in the movie. And the switched some things around. For example: the Ra'zac were chasing Eragon and Brom, not the other way around. And they didn't even go to Teirm. I was disappointed that they changed a lot of things, but I really enjoyed watching the movie. If you never read the book you will most likely LOVE the movie. Over all the movie was pretty good and there were no other problems except for the plot being cut. So I rate the book 8 stars for everything except the plot.",Eragon
785,takarulesursoul,Omg this was terrible!,1,25 December 2006,OK..so i paid like 7 bucks to see this movie and i was blow away by how STUPID AND UNLIKE the book it was! me and my friends sat there laughing at how stupid the movie was! it seemed to happen in the course of 4 days! what is up with that! they should have stretched it out more! and only 3 of the actors could act anyways so that didn't help the movie anyways. if they screw with the second one...words won't be able to describe how awful it will be. so basiclly it was a flop and never should have been made. plus eragons actor couldn't act to save his life and his facial expressions were really out of control.,Eragon
786,edocsilargetbrisingr,"Not so great, and not at all like the book",6,13 December 2006,"I went to see Eragon at a press screening, and I was kind of disappointed. From looking at pictures and trailers I already knew that it wouldn't be like the book, but I was kind of surprised at how different it was. There have been major plot and character changes that will require even more changes in the second movie, the dialog wasn't so great, and there were lots of clichés.The movie, like the book, is a mixture of elements from Star Wars, Lord of the Rings, and Harry Potter. There is even one scene towards the beginning of the movie looks exactly like a scene from Star Wars Episode IV (which the plot of the book follows nearly exactly), and there are other scenes that look very similar to Lord of the Rings scenes. Most odd and surprising of all, there was a striking similarity between Brom and Jack Sparrow, of all people, at the beginning of the movie.As for the actors, Rachel Weisz was definitely not the best choice for Saphira's voice. Weisz made Saphira sound like a teenage girl, not a dragon. A dragon's voice needs to convey power and strength, and Weisz as Saphira's voice just didn't.Some of the dialog was awful. My favorite bad lines were in an exchange between Galbatorix and Durza at the beginning of the movie. In a serious voice, Galbatorix says something to the effect of: ""My stone is missing. I hurt for my stone. Do not prolong my hurt."" Yikes...Overall, the movie wasn't great and it wasn't terrible, but fans of the book will probably be extremely disappointed",Eragon
787,Bombrgurl25,A Little Disappointing..,7,16 December 2006,"The movie could have been longer so that they could have added more detail. But I do realize that if they had put every single bit of information into the movie or they would have had a 4 hour movie. So I was content with the fact that they could get the main parts of the plot in. There were parts that could have been put in, but they may not be that important. I would like to say that people are being a bit too negative towards this movie, because it was not that bad. My only real complaint about the movie is that I thought that John Malkovich's portrayal of the evil king was a bit too calm. I did not think that this horribly evil king could possibly be this calm about the hatching of the egg and the rise of a new dragon rider.",Eragon

789,hilderic523,Horrible.,1,22 December 2006,"I can't find any other word to describe this movie. I don't like the book very much because I obviously compared it to Lord of the Rings or Harry Potter books and they beat Eragon at all. However the I found the trailer pretty good and so I decided to go and see the movie: a big mistake that I regret. There isn't any plot in this and the movie doesn't seem to be the adaptation of Eragon, but a squalid C category movie. So, after seeing Eragon who is (was?) supposed to be the rival of Harry Potter I can definitely say that Harry Potter beats Eragon both as book and as movie. In order to understand the lack of coherence in the plot, I have to make an answer: have writers of the movie read Eragon?",Eragon
790,xxFlyleafxx,Eragon,4,16 December 2006,"The movie was MAJOR disappointment for me. Anyone who has read the book will be outraged. As a fellow reader myself, I will warn you that they don't even stick to the basic storyline. I was surprised at how far off they actually went with this movie. None of the characters are right,at /all/. Arya doesn't have dark hair, as she is supposed to. The dwarfs are tall, the size of a normal man. Angela, the witch, who is in fact supposed to be an old woman, is a young, beautiful,(sexy) girl. Let me just give you the general idea of how bad this movie betrays the book. The King is in the movie, when, in fact he hasn't been in any of the books so far. Brom is killed by the Shade, instead of the Ra'zaac, as he is supposed to be. Murtagh is barely in the movie. And, the scar on his back is only a few inches in length. It is supposed to stretch from one shoulder to the opposite hip. The Shade rides a magical beast, and is killed while riding it. He doesn't even scar Eragons back, either. They betray the story more and more, as the movie goes on. I don't know what they were thinking. They have no right to even call the movie 'Eragon'. Its not the story of Eragon at all.",Eragon

I will purchase it and watch it again and again.But knowing the book side of things as well... it lacks a lot. Brom died wrong, the elf girl (I am terrible with names) didn't go through the whole unconscious thing, Galbatorix had his moment in the sun (unlike the book), the Razak weren't like they were described... neither were the Urgols, Sapphira's wings were ""feathered"" instead of ""membranous"" like a bat, it didn't even go into the significance of Eragon & Sapphira's names, Mertak didn't fight the idea of going to the Vardun, Sapphira just all of a sudden knew how to breathe fire, the stone sapphire wasn't even seen, there were no ""twin"" wizards... worst of all...

My friends and I loved it, except for one of them who expected to see the book. Yes, they changed so many things that it barely followed the book. Yes, they crammed that huge book into somewhere between and hour and a half to two hours. Yes, scenes like the battle with Durza were dramatically altered. But that doesn't mean that it should be pushed away like old cheese. Eragon's dreams were shockingly exciting and different than from his in the book.I couldn't stop bouncing in my seat while I was watching it and my friends kept having to shut me up because of my excited squeals. The best part had to have been the beginning, the prologue. It was nonstop action right from the start. Saphira's voice was different than everybody thought, but it was as close as Hollywood gets. I say you should see this movie as soon as possible, it was definitely worth the time waiting and money for admission and the such.",Eragon

I've never read any of the books so have no frame of reference there.I thought the effects were pretty good, the story moved along nice and quickly and kept me interested. As always, any film these days that have a slight fantasy theme to them get compared to Lord of the Rings right away. (This should stop in my opinion!) I didn't like the Lord of the Rings. Dare I say it here? Take away the tour of New Zealand and they could've made LOTR in one 3 hour movie quite easily.My only disappointment with Eragon was the choice of voice for the dragon. Not the actor's fault as such, just the voice didn't seem to suit. But I guess that's coming from watching Dragon heart I suppose.",Eragon

Oh and if you think it sucked or thought bad of the movie you can just go die because the storyline is still mostly intact from the book and things may happen at different locations or not at all or something that led to an event may not be there but all in all an excellent movie. Like in the book when Eragon stole the meat and leather from Carvahall and then was caught by Brom and Saphira wouldn't listen to him well that part was not in the movie nor was Murtagh saving Eragon and Brom from the RaZac or Eragon and Brom going to Terim or Dras Leona and in Daret was where he used brisinger and where Angela was and the Hadarac Desert was not even in the movie nor was Horst coming to Eragon's rescue in the beginning when Eragon was trying to buy meat.,Eragon
795,cardoza_david,Why even bother calling it Eragon?,1,18 December 2006,"Why even bother acting like they were basing this movie on the book? They could have saved whatever they paid Paolini for the rights by changing the story just a little more and calling it something completely different. No character development, absolutely minimal adherence to the book's description of characters, places, events. This film is a bigger travesty that Star Wars Episodes 1-3 combined. Is Arya even an elf? They certainly didn't seem concerned with establishing the race of any of the characters in the film. Murtagh's scar isn't on his back, Eragon never gets injured by Durza, Saphira breathes fire before the battle begins, Eragon says he barely recognizes himself, despite the fact that only a few days seem to have elapsed over the course of the whole film. When I saw in the previews that they were having an actor play the king, I figured, fine, that's a creative choice that I'm willing to live with, but why the hell have him in there when he makes absolutely no significant contribution to the story? Not only does Arya not act cold toward Eragon, she acts like she's totally in love with him. I was already ready to walk out, but when they came within inches of kissing at the end, I started putting on my coat. And what happened to Farthen Dur? It's one thing to creatively interpret something that isn't really described in the book, but Paolini created Farthen Dur (not to mention a dozen other places and people in the film) in vivid detail. I feel like buying another copy of the book and mailing it to the screenwriter with the suggestion that he try reading it sometime. I've seen a lot of bad movies, and I've never wanted my money back as much as I do after seeing this unbelievable piece of crap.",Eragon
796,karen77-3,In my opinion,3,18 December 2006,"The special effects were awesome, but I'd rather read the book. It just seems they completely rushed the story line (I understand it's a movie, but give me a break.. 1 hr 39m??), which I thought took a lot from the characters and their personalities. Granted I'm sure the budget for this was MUCH less than LOTR, but I think it would have been much better had they taken a little more time to get you familiar with the background and each of the main characters as the book does. Just my opinion though. This movie has definitely settled it for me. I'm never going to see a movie based on a book I've read. It was a real let down for me.",Eragon
797,BilSouter,Worst movie i have ever seen in my whole life! (a rant),1,24 December 2006,"This movie was the worst movie I have ever seen, and anyone that has read the books will agree with me! If you have seen the movie I suggest you don't read the book because you will be so confused on what is happening. This movie skipped 3 whole city's and many, many main characters that were important to the story line. They also skipped many important events like Eragon's back getting slashed open by Durza and him hearing the cripple that is whole in his head. He was also then supposed to go to Elesmera to finish his training with the elves. Also, did you hear of anyone called Orik or Hothgar in the movie? No? Didn't think so! Hothgar was the dwarf king and Orik was Eragons best friend in the book. Oh, and remember the cool ugly smoke monster that Durza was riding (and let me point out that Durza never used magic when fighting Eragon in the book or he would have died for sure) Oh yeah, back to the smoke monster, it was never in the book! Durza was fighting Eragon under the star sapphire (that they also didn't mention) and then Ayra broke it with magic because she was helping Saphira with her broken armor and THAT'S when Saphira first used fire. Eragon then used Zar'roc (who's gem should have been a ruby not a sapphire because Morzans dragon was red) to kill Durza. Then there is the Razac! There were only two in the book! The reason Brom should have died is because they were chasing the Razac because Eragon wanted revenge on them killing Garrow (his uncle). He also never learned sword fighting from Ro'ran and the movie never showed him fighting with Brom. Also, would it have killed them to put in Katrina, Ro'rans girlfriend that gets kidnapped in Eldest by the (((2))) Razac!!! Then they never went to Tierm were he really met Angela (the fortune teller) and The Werecat Solumbun who tells him important information that they need to use in the third book. They also never met Jeod in Tierm who they need to help them find the Razac that they were chasing not running away from them.",Eragon
798,moriahrunner,A Very Good Movie.,9,17 December 2006,"This movie was in fact a very good movie. Most of the bad reviews you may read have one thing in common: they consistently complain about how they didn't stick to the book. And it is very true. They changed a whole lot and to tell the truth, sometimes I was very upset with the changes. But the fact comes down to this: this movie is not the book and it will not be followed step by step like some of us would want it. So if you have read the book make sure, unless you want to be deeply disappointed like other countless readers, when watching this movie to have an open mind and let the movie be its own.With that said here's truly how I truly felt about the movie: The movie, as I have already stated, was amazing. The actors were wonderful, especially Brom, Saphira, and Durza. The special effects looked amazing as well and was absolutely stunning. Most of the time, I think, you can hardly tell that this movie had a PG rating. The score was also well written, full of life and excitement. Overall, when it came down to the movie, it was amazing and definitely does not deserve a 5.2 rating.Now that the good points have been explained, now it's time for the bad points of this movie. The only major flaw of this movie was that it was too short. An hour and thirty-eight minutes or so was not enough to build strong bonds between characters and explain things. Yes there were bonds between Saphira and Eragon and Eragon and Brom but it was not enough. If there were only 10 to 20 or even 30 minutes added on just a minute or more here and there, it would have been even more satisfying. They would have stronger character bonds and the movie would not feel so short. But who said you get everything you want? :)",Eragon

Is there supposed to be a second part to this film? It ended abruptly and open. I'm going to have to read these books and find out what is supposed to be going on here.

The plot was predictable, but good, and I feel the characters were casted well.My main gripe is the fact that the book wasn't followed very well. Sure, they got the main parts down, but several things weren't explained enough to my liking, and far too many things seemed to be put in just to get it over with. I loved the books, and I found myself not enjoying the movie as much as I could because I was thinking over all the things they did incorrectly.However, I attended the movie with someone who hadn't read the books, and she wasn't left confused at all, so maybe they didn't do that bad of a job.All in all, I felt the movie was pretty good, and I will more than likely be seeing it again, whether on DVD or in the theaters.",Eragon

No. thats not what happened in the book...he has many reoccurring dreams about her but it doesn't say her name or anything he just sees her face...and then once he gets captured he recognized the surroundings from scrying her (never mentions scrying in the movie) and then he thinks shes here and saves her...he didn't just go ""I'm a rider and I say we go save this random girl"" that didn't happen like that this movie made me mad...Murtagh did not want to go to the varden. In the book he didn't want to because he was Morzans son and he knew this and told eragon before they decided to go...they would of let him stay if they would of let them enter his mind (didn't mention that in the movie how they can enter each others minds just eragon and Sapphira did in the movie) come on read the book the maker of the movie didn't read it and its quite obvious.

It's starts off all good and you think Great but then the story drags on so slowly you kind of lose interest.The fight and battle scenes aren't all that great. You see maybe the first part and then it's all over and cut to another scene. There is a massive build up to the final battle of the movie but even that is nothing special. The special effects, costumes and characters are great but I think the movie could have been done a whole lot better than the way it has been. Many of the scenes are very reminiscent of LOTR trilogy. I am hoping that the other two books in this trilogy will be made into movies as the ending left a lot of questions and seemed to stop half way through the story.

So even though it wasn't correct (book wise) most people will find the story quite enjoyable and believable. And the movie was also guided by the writer. he must have agreed with the script in some way, otherwise he would not have allowed them to film the movie.

806,nagjud,What a disappointment,1,16 January 2007,"(This is my first review in English, my apologies in advance for the errors).I really enjoyed the novel  it was like an anthology of my favorite authors: Anne McCaffrey, Urusula K. LeGuin, J. R. R. Tolkien, Frank Herbert, yet you can find some original characters or events in the book, and this makes it a fine first novel by Christopher Paolini.I was really hoping that the creators of the film will recognize what made the book so enjoyable and make a movie that is worth watching  what a disappointment! You need three things to make a good movie: screenplay, actors and a director. Let's see what we have got here.1. Screenplay: I can't figure out why the writers of this movie thought that the audience could not comprehend a less simple story or more complex characters. Evil king on the throne  boy finds dragon  boy saves girl  boy saves people  king not defeated so there must be a sequel. Come on, you can find more interesting stories in my little sister's elementary school reading book.2. Actors: Prabably the only reason why Edward Spleneer (who plays"" Eragon) does not fall off the screen is because of his medieval beauty. I can't even say his acting is bad, because there is no acting at all. You have three really good actors though: Jeremy Irons, Djimon Hounsou and John Malkovich and I can't think of any reason why they appear in this movie (probably blackmail), but they have their revenge: they do not act at all, just read their parts. And Joss Stone  bless her, she is a great singer/songwriter, but please keep her out of movies! The only person who actually gives a performance is Rachel Weisz as the voice of Saphira, she can't be anything but perfect (and she had the advantage of not seeing what the other actors are doing).3. Director: Despicable. However taking care that teenage male audience has 5 minutes of fun seeing Sienna Guillory in a sexy outfit, and that teenage female audience has 1.5 minutes of fun seeing Edward Spleneer without his shirt on. Many thanks. Many thanks for making thousands of people disappointed and not wanting to see the sequel, many thanks for making 104 minutes of my life miserable.",Eragon
807,Rheingold,Terrible movie,1,17 December 2006,"From the day I first heard that Fox was producing Eragon, I knew that the movie would be bad. Normally I don't judge movies before they've come out, and especially not by their production company, but I also saw a trailer for the movie the same day. It looked terrible: average CGI flaunted as wonderful (or, rather, wonderful CGI used so poorly it only looked average), wooden acting, terrible dialogue, a plot that is essentially a rip-off of Star Wars. My expectations grew worse with more information about what the movie would be like.What I got was far worse. Not only was there wooden acting, terrible dialogue, and a rip-off plot, but the movie was boring. I found myself looking at my watch every five or ten minutes, and only stayed because I was with a friend who didn't want to leave. I began to look at the short length as a good thing rather than a bad thing; I don't think I could have sat through another half hour of the movie.WARNING: SPOILERS AHEADJohn Malkovich (Galbatorix) was one of the most unconvincing villains ever, albeit second to Robert Carlyle (Durza). To be fair, both were given terrible dialogue, and Carlyle was dressed up to look like a clowncomplete with a red-orange wig and lips outlined in red (which reminded me of Damodar's blue lipstick in Dungeons and Dragonsmaybe it's required that all bad sword-and-sorcery films have villains with right-hand men that wear lipstick). Malkovich seemed to rely on pronouncing his R's to convey his villainous ways; other than that, and the voice-over at the beginning, it was impossible to tell he was the antagonist. Edward Speleers also had terrible lines, although a better actor could have made something of them, and there were scenes in which all he had to do was to convey basic emotion without speaking lines. There was no sadness at all when his mentor, Brom, died to save his life; instead there was just an expression that looked like annoyance. Sienna Guillory (Arya) seemed so out of character the entire movie that I think it has to be blamed on the director, Stefen Fangmeier and not Guillory.The movie opened with a voice-over that lasted too long and did nothing but tell the plot so that the actors didn't have to show it. After the VO, there was brief character introductiontoo short for the audience to begin to identify with anyonebefore going straight into mediocre action scenes. Even the scene that was supposed to introduce the relationship between Eragon and his cousin Roran ended up in a friendly scuffle between the two, perhaps because Fangmeier wasn't capable of directing a scene that had no action element to it. It is made clear in the beginning that the soldiers are the antagonists, but there is no real reason to care for the ""good guys"" other than that the VO at the beginning said so.From the time Eragon and Brom leave Eragon's village, Carvahall, the plot leaves out most of the important plot and character development scenes from the book, perhaps to stay away from the feel of Lord of the Rings. However, the omissions of things such as Brom's teaching Eragon the Elvish language lead to plot holes that could easily have been avoided. The scene at the end in which Eragon risks his own life for the chance to save Saphira's loses most of its potency because Fangmeier failed to include Brom's lecture to Eragon about the fact that a spellcaster cannot choose not to complete a spell that begins to cast and so risks death every time he casts a difficult spell.Because all of the shortcuts taken to get to the end of the plot, the entire movie seems much more contrived than the book did; Murtagh ""just happened"" to know how to get to the Varden, the secret rebel group that Eragon has to join, Brom knew that Eragon was the new Dragon Rider before ever seeing Saphira, and Ajihad knew that Murtagh was the son of Morzan, an evil Dragon Rider who died years before Eragon takes place. At the end of the movie, Arya returns to her home and to her people, riding with an escort carrying standards bearing her shield device, despite the fact that she is a member of an underground resistance movement and is supposed to be hiding from the government.Rachel Weisz's Saphira was just annoying. Weisz had bad dialogue, and wasn't able to make into anything more. Because Saphira only ever communicated through thoughts, and sometimes opened and closed her mouth while ""speaking,"" to Eragon, all of her lines appear dubbed in. Fangmeier didn't seem to think of Saphira as a true character; she never does anything but spout ""wisdom"" and fly around. She has lines like, ""When we are truly one, you will be able to fly from anywhere, even my tail."" Even these problems could have been forgiven if the action scenes and CGI had been better, but even these were not up to par. The action scenes all seemed too contrived, including the final battle at the end between the Varden and Durza's army (interestingly enough, Eragon's line ""We fight as one!"" from the trailer did not refer to him and the Varden, rather just to him and Saphira), and most of them were too short to be good, such as the scene in which Eragon first uses his magic. The CGI was all but wasted on Saphira; she did look good, but a lot of the detail was not necessary given low quality of the rest of the movie, and the effort on her could have been better spent somewhere else.",Eragon
808,PirateLady,Set Star Wars in Middle Earth and You Have Eragon,4,11 April 2007,"My sister and I, both of us Star Wars and Lord of the Rings fans, watched this movie in horror of the blatant plagiarism (well maybe that's a bit too strong of a term) we saw. Some of the scenes, right down to the camera angles, were lifted from both series I've previously mentioned. Mild Spoiler Ahead: The scene where Eragon is wearing the black cloak looks exactly like a mixture of Anikan wearing a cloak and looking toward the camera in Revenge of the Sith, and Luke walking into Jaba's palace in Return of the Jedi. This is a rather mild copy of another movie; I'll save the more obvious and amusing ones for your viewing pleasure, should you be one of those people who loves to butcher bad movies (like me). King Galbatorix is the most unintimidating villain I've ever seen. He is a cardboard cut out, stereotyped, cartoon-like character. A good point of the film is Saphira. She is amazing to look at but, unfortunately, it seems the entire production budget went to realizing her. Murtagh, however briefly he is shown, also isn't too hard on the eyes... ;) I first saw this movie with my 10-year-old cousins, who really enjoyed it. My guess is anyone over 12 will find atrocious, but those under this age will love it.",Eragon
809,cprcpu,I am disappointed to say the least,3,6 April 2007,"Thankfully I didn't purchase the movie or pay to watch it in a theater. I picked it up on my month subscription...and wow, what a let down it was.If you have read the book, the first five minutes of the movie will key you in that not all is right with the world of Eragon.I would never claim the books Eragon and Eldest were literature masterpieces, but they are a good read. They diverted from the story line so drastically that I was tempted to turn it off in the first half hour. It's not that they simply changed the storyline, but they muddled with the motivations of the individuals weaved into the story. Changed the very core of what makes them tick. So if you have read the books, as I'm sure you've read before my post, this is not the same story. If you enjoyed movies such as Beastmaster, or the Dragon Slayer type movies....you'll likely enjoy the movie...just forget what book it's so very poorly based upon.",Eragon
810,monkeysuncle13,how could they?,1,27 December 2006,"eragon, the book, was terrific. but, when they decided to make it into a movie, they ruined one of my favorite books ever. it left out so many parts and they changed so many parts. the writers left out like 200 pages from the middle of the book, and those are some of the most important ones! and what they did put from all those pages, they completely changed around. people traveled to where they never went, people died at the wrong time, and many characters were absolutely terrible in the movie. the actors aren't to blame though, its the writers and directors. they should have actually read the book and found a way to make it as close to it as they could have. i know that many book-to-movies are different, but this was just shameful. i felt cheated and ashamed to be walking out of the theater. i honestly hope that they give up and decide to not make eldest into a movie.",Eragon
811,AngelicMermaid1994,Unexpected...,6,15 December 2006,"Overall, the movie itself was enjoyable. Although the actors chosen hardly matched the descriptions in the book (like the Ra'zac who looked completely different), the scenery was nice with the mountains and valleys (really like the Lord of the Rings though).Instead of looking like a 'diffused white oval', the Gedwey Ignasia looked like a brown scar that twirled around slightly, making it look ordinary with nothing special or grand about it.The plot was altered in many places, and a few important scenes weren't shown, like the scene when Eragon dreams of Togira Ikonoka. Orik the dwarf guide wasn't even shown to help Eragon, Angela the herbalist wasn't there to meet Eragon in Farthen Dur (Solembum wasn't even in the story), and the Twins weren't even included.Some of the expressions the characters bore also weren't suited for that particular moment. But compared to the Harry Potter 3 and 4 movies, Eragon in my opinion is considered to miss only a few points of the story. If they added the scenes they excluded, and fixed the mistakes that they made, this movie would be a whole lot better.",Eragon
812,sarah-995,I really liked it. It was exquisitely well done and I would see it again in the blink of an eye,9,20 December 2006,"Despite everything that everyone else says I really liked the Movie of Eragon. People have said the they left too much of the book out, and that there weren't enough people in the final battle. However! I think that we can't really judge them on what they put in or left out until we have seen all three movies. Because, although they did leave out things that I would say are ""important"", (such as Roran's Katrina, the child that Eragon blesses, and the Star-sapphire) I think that they will easily be able to put in the child and the Star-sapphire in a flash back and Katrina they will most assuredly be able to put in the second movie, Eldest.And they did some things really, really well. The Sephira was really good (so cute when she was born, and then really impressive grown.) Brom was exquisitely well done by Jeremy Irons and was sarcastic and jumpy and all that he was supposed to be. Ed Speleers played Eragon very well, making him strong headed and slightly arrogant when it comes to his skills. I don't know HOW they found someone to play Roran who looked so much like Eragon. The Shade, Durza was satisfyingly creepy and mad looking and i really liked how they showed how powerful he was. Because in the final battle he actually made a dragon-sized creature of Dark magic to ride and fight Eragon and Sephira. My favorite character, Murtagh was also well done.The only problem that I really found was that sometimes the way the people said things didn't really match the era that the movie is set in.",Eragon
813,ghostpirateslayer,High! I'm Not Luke Skywalker but I think we'll be best friends!!!,1,21 December 2007,"(sigh) I actually READ the god awful books , so I knew that they could only yield a god-awful movie. But come on! It's like they're not even trying! I mean somebody had to be there , reading the script and had the balls to say "" Wow this is total crap."" But no. Not even then. They could have stopped the rain and the backlash that would have destroyed what was left of Christopher Palin's reputation , but nay children. It came out and damn did it leave a scar. First off: acting= 3rd grade production. The always awesome Jeremy Irons , does the best he can with the material but he's not god or Johnny Depp. The main character is meh at best.

814,damir-zupanic1,Don't watch the movie-read the book,4,25 December 2006,"When I first heard that a movie is going to be made by the book ""Eragon"" by Christopher Paolini, I must say I was very delighted, and I was even more delighted when I heard that Stefen Fangmeier will be the director. I have read the book, and thaught:""What a great movie this is going to be"". Unfortunately, I was wrong. First of all, I would dare to say that half of the events that happened in the book weren't shown in the movie at all(reason: Lord of the Rings has less then 400 pages and the movie lasts around 3 hours; Eragon has around 500 pages and it lasts around hour and a half). As a result, instead of complexed, unpredictable fantasy plot you get simple, one-way heading fairy tale. Characters that play very significent role in book(like Murtagh, Ajihad and Angela) are hardly even mentioned in the movie, so that it becomes centered on pretty much only 3 characters-Eragon, Saphira and Brom. Villains and locations lack imagination, so they look cheap and ordinary. Choice of actors is, in my opinion, good, except Edward Speleers. There are way too much ""memorable quotes"" in the movie, so that movie becomes kind of too much theatrical.Everybody, from director to actors failed, but still, I personally bealive that the biggest failure is Peter Buchman, screenwriter. Although he had a fantastic material to work on, he managed to ruin it, and make a pathetic screenplay from a fantastic bestseller. Only bright side of the movie is always top-of-the-class John Malkovich(King Galbatorix), pretty solid performance by Jeremy Irons (Brom), but most of all dragon Saphira (voice by Rachel Weisz, whose vocal abilities are on very desirable level)",Eragon
815,Easdraagl,"What's that he's riding?, Dark Magic",4,16 December 2006,"I read the book, and I loved it, I watched the movie, and I was disappointed. The movie overall lacked several things. None of the characters were not developed very well. The dialog was laughable. They left out several major plot points, i.e. the twin magicians, the girl he blesses etc.., it left out some amazing scenes that would have been great visuals, and changed tonjheim to a wooden village, not to mention the fact that they left dwarfs out completely. Quite frankly i cannot see how they will even be able to make three eragon movies, there were so many major plot points left out that come into play in the second one it was amazing. Brom and Eragon's actors had no on screen chemistry i felt no emotion when brom kicked the bucket. In conclusion: a huge huge disappointment. This book could make an amazing movie if: 1. they made it accurate to the book 2. they took their time making it 3. they made it much much longer 4. they fired the writer and had some better write it(maybe paolini?) 5. get a director and a producer who care about preserving the story more than they care about making a special effects blockbuster and finally 6. don't make Durza ride a cloud or dark magic!",Eragon
816,Whizzman,If you're not familiair with a movie called Star Wars you're in for a treat.,3,16 December 2006,"What I have difficulty with in this movie, is that there is no way for me to forget everything around me, leave behind what I think is reality and get sucked into the thing. Why? Because most of it is Star Wars. Literally. Not kind of, or reminiscent. No, a blatant rip-off. It's very distracting. So what this story sorely needed when it was first conceived is a better cover-up, like Harry Potter has, so one at least get's a chance to like it. Not so. Impossible. When the big battle at the end is raging, that's where the movie magic starts... but then it's over. It really does have some nice scenes scattered about, but barraged by classic Star Wars plot lines, motives and dialogue that has been only slightly altered it's so difficult to stay focused. Okay there was a dab of Super Mario in there, and sure it looks like Lord of the RIngs (duh, it's a fantasy flick, they all have to have this look). And details: what was up with those bad guys? They all looked like middle aged men with beer guts. Overall, there is absolutely no reason i can think of why this thing was made. Except for a lack of talent and imagination in Hollywood.

I felt that I was watching something which is remotely connected but essentially a completely different story. Even Peter Jackson did not cover everything in the Lord of the Rings trilogy but the spirit of the book was present in his interpretation. Not here.

Eragon is a loser, so you don't really like him... But you love Saphira... although, she grew up way too fast... And Saphira doesn't ""almost die"" in the book.

My friend and I went to see it Saturday and when Jeremy Irons played out Brom's death scene, I swear I started to cry. I personally think this movie deserves a GREAT review from ANY critic.... Also, contrary to what Goldenduc says, the acting was really good. I mean, yes, Rachel Weisz's voice acting was the absolute BOMB but still, give some credit to the other actors. This movie is SO going in my list of Top Five's.

None of the actors are that great in this movie. It also isn't like the movie was edited due to time constraints. It was completely changed for no reason. I understood them taking out the reading of records, blah blah, but everything seemed out of order.The Razac were also too easy to kill. Some of the sequences where they were riding horses could have been used for Brom teaching Eragon magic. Also, Murtagh wasn't exactly a friend of Eragon like in the book, he was just their 'guide.' My other big beef is the ending. While spectacular, it would have been so much better if they followed the book ending. A character that didn't really show up was Angela.

They managed to trim things from the book but keep the story the same. The only similarity from Eragon book to movie was that some character names were the same and there was a dragon.

From the ""comments"" I heard while she she was watching she seemed very disappointed in the quality of the acting and the fact that the plot was very different from the books.(If you do not want to know anything about the film do not read on.)For example the film makes out Eragon is in control of the dragon when in the book he is not and does not have details such as dragons fire is the same colour as the dragon.Some of the characters and places in the book were also missed out.

828,pmcds,Could have been the new 'LOTR',6,4 January 2007,"Anyone who has read 'Eragon' would have eagerly awaited the film version of Christopher Paolini's novel. However, I can only imagine most would feel more disappointment than anything else. While the basics of the plot are followed, the details seem to have been ignored. Perhaps the largest of these is the fact that Arya, whom Eragon rescues, contacts him while she is unconscious which, by the way, is most of the book!! Yet in the film, she's right as rain. A little bump on the head, but we mustn't let that stand in the way of ruining what could have been something great so we can see a teenage boy's attraction to an elf! Oh no! Jeremy Irons and John Malkovich provide us with the high level of class we have come to expect of them, and the casting choices sit well with me, and pretty much everyone else I have spoken to. So, it is just the transition from book to screenplay that causes disappointment. Had I not read the book, I would have thought the film was okay, but, because the book is so good, and Paolini goes out of his way to explain nearly everything, I'm left feeling robbed. I appreciate that in order to make a film 100% true to its book would require too long and often boring a film, but let's start with basics: if you're going to make 'the film of the book', follow it as closely as possible. Stick with successful plots and subplots. You'll get more happy watchers, especially if you've sequels in the pipeline.

Urgals=Uruk-Hai, evil creatures sent to take the main character downThen, the party is SUPPOSED to band together with a dwarf. Wow. I smell Tolkien. Basically, I was completely aggravated by the lack of sensible (and original) storyline. The graphics were great, but a movie isn't made on their graphics.

There are some differences in every movie based on a book I can guarantee you that not one movie is exactly like the book it's based on!!!! You people should be ashamed for saying such things about a completely okay movie. No body cares except a handful of you that want it to be exactly like the book.

There were a few people in the movie that didn't live up to their reputations, but who cares just sit back and relax and enjoy the movie. Personally I'd rate it a 7.5 or8.

832,celestihel,Why did they call it Eragon?,1,24 March 2007,"5% names from the book. 5% approximate time line. 90% nothing remotely like the book. You'd think that in nearly 800 pages of novel, most of which was dialog, this script could have found...I don't know...ANY OF IT TO USE. Characters appear that have not yet shown up in 2 books in the series. Key plot points aren't even glossed over, they are omitted altogether. In their place are story lines that never existed. Frankly, they never should have. They didn't even give their elves pointy ears. I wouldn't complain, except that this is actually important in the book, both books. In short, this fabrication is a joke.I borrowed this movie from the library, for free. I want my money back.",Eragon

834,dragnlady81481,"I am sorry, but wasn't this supposed to be based on the book!",3,19 December 2006,"I gave it a 3 only because of the special effects. If you have read the book then DO NOT go see the movie. Don't waste your money for you will be sorely disappointed. 3/4 of the movie is different from the book including how characters meet (Angela, Murtagh, THE VARDEN!), how they die (Durza!), and even the age of Eragon! They don't take the time to show Brom training Eragon. Eragon knows Arya's name which he isn't supposed to until later. You have no idea how he learned magic. They don't even cross the dessert which almost claims their lives! The Varden are nondescript and none of the characters are what they are supposed to be. Where are the dwarfs? Why is the city inside of a mountain valley instead of underground like it is supposed to be? Where are the twins who are supposed to test Eragon for his magical abilities? They could have explained all this and not left the important details, that help make the story whole, out in 20-30 mins and we would have sat through a 2-2.5 hour movie that was worth it. Instead they wasted my money and my time. The writing became cheesy and clichéd, so much so that I began to laugh at the lines. I appreciate the actors for doing the best they could with such a poor butchering of what could have been a great film (and possibly a great trilogy), but you only do so much. I REALLY love the books and was hoping that with current success of Harry Potter, and the recent success of The LOTR Trilogy that they would see that audiences don't mind if you leave a few minor details out. But changing the entire story will lose you fans. I will not go to the theater and see the second if they make one.",Eragon
835,wolf_1515,Horrible,1,4 January 2007,"Horrible horrible HORRIBLE representation of Paolini's work. Uses only some of the characters, leaves many out and completely changes the story's plot line destroying any hopes that there could be a second movie that accurately represents the second book! Take for example the complex emotions between Roran and Eragon (oh, I forgot, the film changed the script so that Roran had no idea Eragon was the reason for the attack on their farm), the killing of the Ra'zac, the way Eragon saved Arya or the lack of insight into the political doings in the film and you will see my point. What ever gave the person who wrote the screenplay the idea that this is alright to do? Why not just change the names of the characters and the title and oh! you'd almost have an original work... a bad original filled with stereotypes, bad acting and special effects.Now, I must say that I was very impressed about one thing in the movie: the actor that did Saphira's voice. Very nice and convincing, almost exactly as I had imagined it.",Eragon

I remember when it first came out, the trailer kind of made me want to go see it but not bad enough. so yesterday i received through netflix, i started watching it and it is horrible, corny, no real plot, and doesn't tie you in to the characters. ***SPOILERS**** and the mind reading thing between saphira and eragon made me the the graphic artist were either not talented enough or too lazy to make the dragon speak. And there were too many sequences that just made you want to slap some sense into that boy!",Eragon
837,jojolydsieandbean,They ruined it.,2,21 December 2006,"This movie was adapted worse than Harry Potter was. And that's saying something. Honestly, if they'd renamed the characters and title, I would have NO IDEA it was Eragon. Sure, the movie's entertaining enough, but only if you don't think of it as 'Eragon'; if you do, you're most likely to run out of the theater ripping your hair out and screaming. I restrained myself from doing this, but I couldn't stop myself from laughing loudly at the dead serious parts; I had to let out the hysteria that was building up SOMEHOW. The way they twisted the facts around (even the simple ones) left it with no possible way of making a movie of 'Eldest' (the sequel to 'Eragon'); or if they did, they'd have to make up the script entirely, with no help from the book. My 6-year-old sister enjoyed this, so I suppose it's an entertaining adventure for youngsters, but if you've read the book you're much better off not seeing the movie. If I were Christopher Paolini, I'd be dead from horror.",Eragon

When I was watching this movie i was so confuse, because I didn't understand what movie i was watching... well, it seen like ""Lord of the rings"" ( warriors, elves...) but the history is the same than ""Star Wars""... Luke was a farmer, like Eragon... He lost his family... he found a master... this master died to save him... He had big power... at the end he save the people... and probably in the future he'll discover Galvatorix is his father... ¿O maybe the princess is her sister...? Well... too much coincidences. Even that, i think it could be a good movie... but is very slow, and fast at the same time... the characters are poor, without identity and the dialogue... these are the worse: they are stupid and repetitive... It's a pity! I would like to say something different... i hope the next one (if there's a new one) change the director, and to the writer: please, you have to be more original, I think...",Eragon
839,papadoudjh,"""I expected more. More - Well, more""",4,15 December 2006,"This quote gives a good review of the movie as a whole. I came into the theater with no prior knowledge of the books, and left with hardly anymore than when I entered. If not for the coffee I drank before the showing I would likely have been awakened an hour later by children applauding the movie they had been fooled into viewing. As Goldenduc has stated, the movie's scene-stealer was Saphira, the dragon whose above average animation and voice-acting carried the movie. Readers of the book(such as two of my fellow viewers who reported it horribly inaccurate) will be disappointed by the film's bad acting and poorly-paced chronology(Or may lie to themselves and give it a 10 like 41% of the voters thus far).Those who enjoyed the masterpiece book ""Eragon"" were most likely suspicious when the movie's rating was revealed as PG. As 6 to 12-year-olds filled the theater, older members of the audience felt an ominous chill that manifests before the start of a poor movie. From the moment the main character picks up his bow in the opening scene, you can sense the films bad filmography and quick pace will be it's downfall. Roughly ten minutes into the movie the main character's are introduced and killed-off or sent away. Soon after Saphira hatches and creates a false sense of hope that the movie may be saved. Before the audience was done ""Aww""-ing at the cute dragonling, it transforms into a full-grown beast and its bond with it's rider is solidified. A few more poor actors are introduced and the ""Darkest Knight""-esquire fumbles onward, sprinting through the most important parts and trudging through meaningless scenes. Before you know it the final (and first?) battle has been fought and won, and a miserable cliffhanger paves the way for a sequel movie-goers are sure to avoid.The one upside to the movie was not it's namesake, but the dragon on which Eragon rides, Saphira. The dragon's animation is fluid and realistic(although not when Eragon is integrated) and its voice calming yet authoritative. However, like most of the movie, the dragons physical maturation and bond with it's rider goes by too fast and leaves the viewer with an unpleasant longing for more. The fact the intelligent dragon needs a rider in the first place may have fantasy-buffs in wonder.To wrap-up it should be stated that the movie is rated PG for a reason, because there's just enough violence that it didn't make G. The constant new information is introduced to fast and is reminiscent of children role-playing(""It's(the sword) a dragon killer!"" ""You must pierce a Shade in the heart to kill it."" ""If a dragon's rider dies, so does the dragon""). The erratic pace of the movie makes no sense, more time is spent showing Saphira learn to fly than is Eragon's time of mourning for his lost uncle. Overall, the movie earned 4 stars( of 10) for it's decent CGI and voice-acting, and the remaining 6 were stripped away due to lame pacing, bad acting and pseudo-logical fallacies that made you think ""Wait, what?""",Eragon
840,kaloscharybdis,An improvement over the book,4,21 December 2006,"Well the film was bad, but look at the source material. I've seen several critics complaining that Eragon is derivative and unoriginal. Considering Paolini's not-ready-for prime time near plagiarism of a novel I don't know why they were surprised. I guess the film critics decided to skip the book. I rather wish I had too. Anyway, the plot was weak, the lead actor rather wooden and the elven beauty looked like a Xena extra. There were several good points though. I'm thinking here of Rachel Weisz, who actually gave Saphira some personality; Jeremy Irons who once again managed to bring his own special je ne sais qua to a pretty meager role; and John Malkovich who just excels and being mad and evil doesn't he? I also enjoyed the efforts of Robert Carlyle as Durza. The main reason to see this film would be the scenery though. The effects are fine but the cinematographer really captures the beauty of Transylvanian Hungary. I got a tad bit homesick at points! The decision on the part of the filmmakers to axe the most of the more hideously rendered scenes that so obviously follow far superior sources was a sound one. It made the story much less painful without the constant reminders that the author has never had an original thought in his short, sheltered life. The other good choice made by the crew was to focus far more on the scenery than the story. As I mention above they use the natural beauty of the land to breathtaking effect. I'd give the film four of ten, mostly out of pity that the cast and crew has to trudge through something from such a poor source. I am still baffled as to how people could be so dumb as to think the book was decent, let alone good enough to warrant a film. Oh well, go see Eragon if you're a fan of post cards of the Hungarian Carpathians but other wise skip it. I love Jeremy Irons as much as the next guy but some films shouldn't have been made.",Eragon

I thought the book was quite good and descriptive but the film has destroyed it for me! I can't believe some of my friends like it! UNBELIEVABLY BAD !! I am disappointed. The dragon looks more like a bird/Griffin than a dragon... DRAGONS ARE REPTILES!!! - they shouldn't have FEATHERS!!! And Edward Speelers or whatever his name is can't act...

The books are awesome, and the description are such that it shouldn't have been too difficult to rewrite into a screenplay that did the book justice. The cast was exceptionally good, accept for, no offense meant, for the actress who played Arya (she didn't have the right physic or look for the part).I was disappointed when I saw the movie. I had my dad buy it for me to see if there was any explanation for why the movie had been so bad. I counted almost forty differences between the movie and book in the first twenty-five minutes. Every thing from Garrow's death, to the Razac, to Brom's characterization,to Durza's powers, to the Urgal's appearances, to Arya's capture. Probably the biggest mistake, for me, was the Saphria's wings were feathered instead of membranes. In an interview on the DVD, the director stated that he made the changes intentionally.",Eragon
843,atrium601,Waste of expectations!,2,19 December 2006,"I was really disappointed with this movie! I actually enjoyed Jeremy Irons' acting, although it did look like was totally unsupported by his co-actors, but it all came down pretty tasteless. The lack of impact of... well... everything, got me in a bad real bad mood. There's not a single intense scene that hooks you up to your seat. On the contrary there are many unbelievably stupid scenes that almost make you run screaming out of the theater (like the one when the Urgal gets ""promoted"" by Durza hums in disappointment)... I thought I was going to cry when pretty much everyone else laughed! The characters have absolutely no noticeable evolution, specially Eragon, and there are SO MANY stuff missing from the from, that you begin to think that you imagined them - because they should be there! Like Solembum... where is he? On Rachel Weisz's voice: nothing to say except ""very good""!So, basically, it all comes down to this: If you did read the book, read it again, because there's not a single chance that you may like this movie (unless you're under 10yo or suffer from severe memory loss). If you did not read the book and get the feeling that the story's time span is no more than 72 hours, please go spend a couple of bucks and see how wrong you where!",Eragon
844,gamergirl247,An insult to the book.,3,18 December 2006,"Did any of the filmmakers even read Eragon before they made this movie. It seemed to me that they were too busy with the CG of Saphira to bother reading the book so instead had someone, who really sucks at summarizing, tell them how the book goes.Many important characters and events were omitted, changed, or just plain bad. Many of the actors were horrible, especially Galbatorix, who tries way to hard to sound sinister. Ajihad had a phony accent and barely any facial expressions, but he was only in the move for about a minute and a half so he didn't have much time to really say or do much anyway. Many other characters from the book had little or no screen time. Angela was in it for only half a minute, but that was enough to ruin her character. She spoke in third person, was all mystical when in the book she was pretty lighthearted, and like Ajihad, had no facial expressions. She also appeared to be blind and Solembum wasn't even included. Much of Eragon's fortune was omitted, focusing mainly on his future love, Arya. But Arya stole most of the movie anyway. The dwarfs, the Twins, Jeod, and Katrina weren't included in the movie at all. Did anyone notice that Durza's eye color changes halfway through the movie? If you decide to see it, despite all of the reviews against it, notice that at the beginning his eyes are a pale bluish gray. Later, they're golden yellow even though in the book they're neither color. . That's just one of the many mistakes that the filmmakers create. Eragon's mark on his palm in the book is silver, but in the movie it's a spiral shaped scar. The Urgals like more like wrestlers than a separate race and have no horns. One of the favorite characters in the book, Murtagh, had about 5 lines in the entire movie. He was one of the more complex characters in the book but was one of the most forgettable characters in the movie.The only character in the movie that was at all memorable or even likable was Saphira. Her voice actor was great and fitted the dragon's personality nicely. And yet the film still messed her up. The book stated many time that she had bright and shiny scales and yet in the movie she is mostly covered in feathers. She also grows from a hatchling to a young adult by being struck by lightning. wtf? Overall, the movie doesn't even deserve to have the same title as the book since the two share very little similarities.",Eragon

I would say that the deviation from the book did make me cringe in a few places, but that is to be expected. I personally didn't like the face that Ayra didn't look like an elf, but i assume that there is some reason or another for that.

His cousin at the beginning as i said to my mother is from Home and away... i said he was as soon as i saw it but i don't think that will spoil anything for anyone unless they are waiting to see which movie of TV series the characters are from. but the boy Ed Speleers is only in Eragon so i think it is unfair... cause a newbie is on screen with stars from multiple other movies and shows.",Eragon

I strongly disliked it because the only part of the story it seemed to follow was the names of the characters, the rest of it being inaccurate and poorly scripted.

Ra'Zac were not supposed to die and Brom never set Garrow on fire in the book. The Film makers obviously did not consult Paolini during the production of this film. The movie cut out major characters such as Orik and the important characters that were included only had a couple lines. If you have not yet read the book I recommend you do so. Eragon was absolutely terrible. Some parts were interesting like when Saphira appears to save Eragon in Gil'ead. Many characters were not played by a very good actor either. Edward Speleers' acting career will now be over and how short it was. Djimon Honsou sounded like he had a pool of drool in his mouth and Sienna Guillory didn't even look like an elf. The movie skips many important cities and puts people like Angela the fortune teller in the wrong one. The only thing notable about this movie was the digital effects and Rachel Weisz as Saphira. I pray that someone with more experience will make an Eragon remake be cause readers will be very disappointed.,Eragon

There was nothing original in this movie and it even did a poor job of rehashing prior works.What it lacked it talent, meaning, or value, the film seemed to try to make up for with special effects, but giving the success of movies such as The Lord of the Rings trilogy and the Harry Potter saga, these visual tricks did little to impressIf I wasn't watching with friends I would have stopped after 10 minutes and saved an hour and a half of my life that was poorly wasted.",Eragon

I believe that Eragon and Eldest are two of the best books i've read and the movie was disgraceful. It seamed more like they read the summary on the back of the book and made a movie of what they thought it was about. So what happened to the dwarfs? the scar he gets from Durza? and a million other things they left out? They killed the Ra' Zac easily when the Ra' Zac are still in the third book. The Urgals instead of being a different race they are just barbaric men with tattoos. Arya leaves to Ellesméra without Eragon?? how can they even make a second movie based on the second book. My personal opinion is the director didn't really care for the book and only made the movie as a job. A director shouldn't make a film unless he really likes the idea and desires to make it come to life. I was impressed on how well movies like The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe (2005) and the Lord of the Rings Trilogy did in making the movies as real and as close to the books as they can. I know that they can't fit an entire book in but they could have at least given the book the respect it deserves. The Harry Potter series aren't the best at being accurate but they're close enough to give them credit. I should not feel like a did Hollywood a disfavor by supporting a movie, which is how i felt after seeing it tonight. If i were them i would destroy any evidence of this new film and start over from scratch, and put people in charge who actually have a love for the book.

(I half expected to hear Speelers start whining about power converters) Even Eragon's best points don't measure up to the worst in LOTR, Harry Potter, and Star Wars.I also had high expectation for the rookie director, Stefen Fangmeier, considering his impressive visual effects credentials.

But when i saw it i was astounded at how brutal the director had been with the script, i mean in the LOTR at least most of the basic plot was there, and i do take it as read that all films are worse than the books (if anyone can tell me one that's better i would be please to be corrected), but in Eragon he tells us so much of the story in the first 5 minutes, or it seems to be the first 5 minutes, turns out it's half an hour, but he drags his feet getting started. Also the level of detail is astounding, i mean who would forget to point the elf's ears? All it takes is a cheap clip. And it's blatantly obvious that they cut corners with the CGI of Sapphira and adapted a bird, i mean when have you EVER heard of a dragon with FEATHERS? I could go on... For all you people who can't be bothered to read all that, a summary;He made a mockery of a good book, and cut out more important plot developers for the second book than the new version of H2G2.",Eragon
861,nszbxtkck,And they started so well...,4,16 March 2021,"They started with amazing casting and had modern CGI at their fingertips..then.. well..Imagine a movie being written by someone who had been told the storyline by someone else who had skimmed the cliff notes. It's abysmal. The story is disjointed and so off track to the book that it is confusing. It's obvious that they had no intention of making a sequel to continue the storyline. The actors did what they could with what they were given.
Saphira's CGI representation is puzzling. They could have done ANYTHING and they chose a dull leathery look with feathered wings?! Rachel Weiz's voice at least deserved the jewel bright scales of the book. The whole thing seemed like something that was created to make money off of fans of the book and then die.",Eragon
862,gelertfan,Yay!,10,6 January 2007,"Love it! The girl actors are beautiful, the male actors cute (except Ajihad and Garrow, but why are they supposed to be cute?), and Sahira seems so real it's as if dragons are a real species! Well, I do like to go along with my imagination and believe dragons are real. Lol. Anywho... The plot line's great. It's very adventurous, and even in some parts, very sad. Like the part where Garrow dies and Brom dies. So sad. ;~; But anyway, um, so that shows you an Inheritance Trilogy and Eragon movie lover. Whoohoo. LOL. I wonder what Eragon's favorite food is. Maybe pie. Or steak. But I know Saphira certainly loves steak. Or any other meat. Lol.",Eragon
863,red_one77,ridiculous,1,24 December 2006,"i've read about the comment's made on this film...and i agree with this phrase ""When the dragon Saphira gives the only good performance in the entire film, you know there is something wrong.""...OK this is exact in the original version...because ""The only performance in the film that has any credibility what so ever is the dragon Saphira and that's mainly because she is voiced by Oscar winning actress Rachel Weisz, who has more talent in her vocal cords than all the actors working in this film combined""..i just let you imagine...in the Italian version the voice of the dragon is interpreted by ""ilaria d'amico"" an Italian Soubrette...simply ridiculous...i haven't word to comment it...VOTE 1...(0 is impossible)",Eragon
864,kitsunekamisama,"Whatever that was, it was hardly Eragon...",2,28 December 2006,"What did the producers think when they put together this crap? Reading the books must not have come to their mind as they borrowed some characters from Paolini's awesome novels and made their own plot and storyline.If they at least had managed to get the characters they did borrow to even vaguely familiar to the ones in the book that might have raised my score to a 3-4/10. What was up with the urgals for one... They looked like some sort of dumb orch wannabes. What happened to their mighty horns and their size? And Angela... my absolute favorite character from the books, turned into some glittery actress wannabe. By the way, where did Solembum go? Also why, oh why, did they kill off the Ra'Zak in the first movie? They too wasn't at all like they are described in the books for that matter. Also, as I wasn't paying that much attention to the movie in the end, was Durza's bat thingy supposed to be an adult Ra'Zak? (Can't remember what they were called in the books.)Last, but definitely not least, what was up with making Saphira grow up from a hatchling to what I guess would be regarded as a teen dragon by just letting her fly for 10 seconds? Really, this trilogy could have rivaled Lord of the Rings if had gotten the same attention and budget. Skip the movie and read the books.",Eragon
865,cieslik_margaret,too high expectations?,1,16 December 2006,"Maybe I had expected to much.Maybe, over last few years, I just got used to bookbased, fantasy films made with amazing care for details. Maybe a film like this needs a director with a vision, with passion for the subject. I really don't know. What I know is that the Eragon film is, at least to me, a total failure. There is not much left from the book  names of the characters and few scenes (usually also modified almost beyond recognition). All Eragon's journey, especially his growing up, better understanding of himself, the way his existence changed the world around him,all of this is gone. The film is just made of few, extremely badly joined together, scenes. You can just tell that both director, as well as screenplay author, lacked necessary imagination. Even good actors weren't able to save the film  they were tied by bad screenplay and incredibly stupid and naive dialogues. A total waste of time.But maybe this disaster will help film producers understand that popular subject and bestselling book are not enough  you also need people who will make it worthwhile.",Eragon
866,midpikyrozziy,"If you enjoyed the book, don't watch this!",3,12 February 2007,"An attempt to turn a good book into a good film should failed. It is, on the whole poorly cast, except for Rachel Weiss as the voice of Saphira, and the actor who plays Sloan. I found myself wondering why Galbatorix, the evil king who had killed all the previous Riders with his gang was looking like an unevil tried old man who never left one room. In making it a PG, to attract younger viewers, it loses most of what could have made it better if it were a 12 or 15; better, more violent, fight scenes instead of the rubbish kiddy fight scenes. In an effort to make the movie not too long, they have decided to cut some bits out, which is fine, but in this case they have cut all the wrong bits out. It ignores Rorans relationship which will be quite hard to introduce for the second film, Eldest which half centers around Roran. It also doesn't show or mention Horst who also quite a big role in the second book, or Jeod. Overall, I would say the weakest point in the film is that it fails to add anything extra - it has weak, straightforward lines, with poor directing and bad acting,and isn't worth the cinema ticket. With Peter Jackson as director, the movies could be top box office sellers, for the story is good enough, but with the current guy, it can only get worse.",Eragon
867,LWatson72,I liked it.... even having read the book!,9,28 December 2006,"Eragon far exceeded my expectations, which were rather dampened by all of the negative reviews I've heard. I enjoyed the book, and enjoyed the movie as well. Edward Speleers, while very cute :), was well cast and portrayed Eragon well. Brom, Arya, and Murtagh did justice to their roles too. Saphira was excellently done; the flying scenes are spectacular and she adds a bit of humour to the movie too, with her snappy dialogue voiced by Rachel Weisz.If you are looking for a word-for-word adaptation, you, I admit, will hate this movie. I found myself missing a couple of parts, such as the part in the book where Eragon is naming Saphira and also Eragon's training with Brom, which was my favourite part of the book. There are really no plot holes, though, as I found. I really enjoyed Roran's character as a simple farmboy, and Durza and his Urgals were so EVIL looking. The final battle was spectacular, although it was a little dizzying because they had the camera cutting in and out all the time. It was good though.This is a good family movie- kudos to the director for keeping it PG (they had room to make it much more gory!). I'm 13 and have read the book, my dad's 40 something and has not, and we both enjoyed it immensely. Go see for yourself.",Eragon
868,bandgeek511,a letdown.. but not the worst movie...,6,2 January 2007,"OK...I was let down about the movie. I absolutely adore the books... and I was very much looking forward to seeing the movie. I was let down. It definitely WAS NOT the absolute worst movie I have ever seen. As I was watching, I realized it probably would have been MUCH better if I hadn't read the books. The graphics were VERY good, and the music... was the best part of the whole movie. The acting was good, and I give Ed Speleers, (Eragon) credit. For this being his professional acting debut, he portrayed Eragon very well. What I gathered, was the main things in the book that needed to happen, happened on the screen. But the writers definitely twisted the way in which we arrived to the main things. They left out characters, and vital details/events that were important in the book. I am anxious to see how they would go about doing ""Eldest,"" considering many parts vital to continue were left out. I was also disappointed in how long it was... They could have totally made it longer... I mean look at Lord of the Rings... it was long, but VERY thorough... and it made the books come alive... but with Eragon.. It was like I was watching it on fast forward. Some of the magic was lost... But like i said.. it is not the worst movie out there. I definitely recommend the books though... If only they could do this over again... it definitely had the potential to be a GREAT movie. Let's hope with Eldest... someone stands up, and attempts to fix these issues, and try to do the books some justice.",Eragon
869,irishgouker,Poorly done.,1,22 April 2007,"This movie is pathetic. I just learned the film was based on some novels. I feel sorry for readers who feel let down by this translation to film. As someone who did not read the books, I can only hope that they are not filled with as much plagiarism as the movie contains. Eragon has a multitude of distinct scene replications from The Lord of the Rings, Pirates of the Caribbean, Braveheart and every other good adventure film from the last fifteen years. Jeremy Irons must be so embarrassed! The film also reminded me of a badly done high school drama where everyone keeps missing their cues to come on-stage. Sure, Rachel Weisz is good. However, is that really a compliment when you never have to show your face on film and all the other actors and waiting for their lines from off-screen? Ick! I couldn't even finish watching this film, partly for how terrible it was and partly because I felt bad for authors and screenwriters whose work was copied so obviously. Eragon is just a poorly patched together clone. Stay far away from this film.",Eragon
870,moose_i_am,This is...,1,24 December 2006,"THE WORST THING I HAVE EVER SEEN. There are scenes in this movie which have been taken directly from Star Wars, and is the most cliché movie ever created. Why did Jeremy Irons bother getting out of his acting grave to do this? Why did John Malkovich even consider it? The only thing gained from this film was the knowledge that Rachel Weiz should NEVER voice act again. They should of just made the dragon Sean Connery, i know it would screw up the whole ""storyline"" of the book, but you know the director seemed to take care of that himself.The story just sorta skipped, and any character that was developed was hated, and the rest that weren't you still hated. Curse you Peter Jackson for revamping this genre.",Eragon
871,mogorovic-1,Did they have someone take care of continuity?,3,14 December 2006,"I saw the film last night. I must say that I like this kind of movies, and that I have found a lots of good things even in the Prince Valiant film (1997). But, I think that it is totally unacceptable to release a movie with so many obvious continuity mistakes. Not in a third plan but all over the screen, and it was not one or two, but 10 - 15 at least. More than enough to start to consider the whole film as a parody. It appears that it was not such a low budget production - on contrary, and they have still managed to have the arrow stuck in and out of the forehead in the same scene. I think that costumes were as bad. Some pieces, the pants of the main character for instance, are exactly like very modern designed casual ones, and so. Talent performance - like the '80. low budget East European TV production. Except, of course, for the Ms Weisz and maybe Mr. Alun Armstrong. I did like the Dragons, all 3. They made me a little bit less angry. Tnx.",Eragon
872,karensh2001,"God movie, but not very close to the book",10,30 December 2006,"If you have read the book Eragon, you might be very disappointed if you go and watch this movie. The movie does not contain many details from the books, and a lot of the leading characters does not appear. Further more, the writers of the movie have chosen to shorten the book and rewrite a lot of the book's main story. THerefore a fan might leave the cinema furiously. But if you HAVEN'T read the book, and are longing to go and watch a movie filled with action, fantasy and fantastic creatures, this is one you shouldn't miss!! The actors are AMAZING in their roles, and the graphics stands up to movies like ""The lord of the rings"" and ""Harry potter"" This is a movie for people with an adventurous person hiding in them self... this is a movie that will leave you amazed!",Eragon

Wooden, cheesy acting pervades the film. Important characters, such as all of them are either misportrayed or don't show up at all. -Spoilers-(Not that this movie does any good anyway) Horst and his family are missing, Roran leave to make money for his soon to be wife, not because he is dodging the draft. Galbatorix's army doesn't have a stationing is Carvahall. THe Ra'zac were not bug ninjas, and they destroyed the farm, not Brom. Brom doesn't die from Durza's spear, he dies saving Eragon from a Ra'zac knife. The list goes on.... -End Spoilers-All in all, don't waste your time, or your money going to see this piece of filth.

But Ed Speelers was great as Eragon, his first big movie role. The fight scenes were amazing and the dragon was beautiful! The acting was spectacular, I loved Rachael as Saphria. It was brillian. Jeremy irons is an excellent actor and i felt that Eragon and Brom had a certain connection on screen. Overall, This movie was amazing and I would love to see it over and over again. It wasn't exactly like the book, but it was close. Can't wait for Eldest! I highly recommend this title, its a great family movie!!",Eragon
875,tanner-stewart,Why?! Why did they turn a piece of art into some cheesy movie?!,5,17 December 2006,I loved the book and disliked the movie. I saw it the first day it was out and was totally disappointed. The book was awesome and the movie was something I probably wouldn't have seen if I had fair warning. I think whoever wrote the movie didn't even read the book! Angela is in a different town thats not Teirm! They got the Urgals wrong. The dwarfs weren't short and Arya doesn't have pointy ears like an Elf should have! The Urgals attack Eragon were he uses his magic and kills them and when he does the town he uses them in isn't slaughtered! Also They only thing thats remotely cool about this movie are the magic visuals and some of the battle sequences. I truly hope Christopher Paolini stops Fox from making Eldest like they did with Eragon.,Eragon
876,midasgf,"""You know how legends go - people believe anything these days"" - yeah, including this trollop",2,9 January 2007,"This film was to be put lightly, dire. That said, The actors were horribly underused and the dialogue was desperate at best. That said, it features some impressive and appropriately used CGI. Although CGI despite some people's opinions does not make a film into a film. It's supposed to be an enhancer, not the core of the film. The storyline is poor, and not deep at all. In fact, in between laughing ourselves silly, the friend I went with was commenting with me how much it was like Lord of the Rings. Or trying to be. There are parallels between the characters in the two. However to be honest, if you like fantasy films, watch Lord of the Rings rather than what appears to be a Lord of the Rings spoof. And the names were reminiscent of Shyalaman's talent with creature names (a la Lady in the Water). I'm sure that children everywhere are enjoying it, much to my dismay. Show them Lord of the Rings instead. Or just substitute words in; rename Eragon to Frodo, change the fact he's a hobbit into a teenager, rename Brom to Aragorn/Gandalf, look at Arya like she's a Gandalf image, treat Durza as Saruman, Urgals as Wildmen and Raza as Uruk-Hai. Unbelievable.",Eragon
877,lindizzy,Can you say.. Epic-Wannabe?,1,21 December 2006,"So, I re-read Eragon and Eldest before the movie came out. Oh, wow. You know, I wasn't expecting for this movie to be exactly like the book, because there aren't any movies to my knowledge that stay 100% true to the book, but 10 minutes into the movie I was horrified. I can deal with the minor things, like the ""Shining-palm"" being in the shape of a dragon, but there was so much cut out, pasted in, and altered, I really wonder if the writer/director/producer read the book or the summary on Wikipedia.There are really a lot of things that have been pointed out, and someday I should like to make a huge list or table of all the things that went wrong. Personally, sometimes straying from the book can be good for a movie. But this.. this was an insult to Eragon readers.There was so much left out, the only way they're going to be able to do the sequel is to screw that one up too. I was just.. upset, angry, disappointed, bored with the movie.Spend your money on a better movie, seriously.",Eragon
878,modjore,what the hell was that?,1,18 December 2006,"i could not have imagined a worse adaptation of the book. Not only was there absolutely no character development but the film didn't follow the books plot in the slightest way. Anybody who is a fan of these great books will most likely walk away from this movie with second hand embarrassment for the director. To even think that this movie could be under 2 hours is insanity, so much crucial back story and character introduction was cut from the movie. And what the hell was that fight all about at the end with Durza? what happened to Eragon getting his back sliced open? What happened the giant gem ceiling of the dwarf kingdom. i mean honestly, how can this director sleep at night knowing he has made such a mess of this highly anticipated film. This man has killed the trilogy before it even got going, especially since the movie doesn't even end in a way that sets up the second book accurately. Very disappointing.",Eragon

The book was not even read by whoever wrote the script. None of the races described looked as they should have. On top of all that the dragon is more like a really big bird and other than a few CG scenes the entire movie looked cheap. I was shocked that they smeared some great actors by having them appear in this piece of filth. It reminded me of the D & D movie, only this one was worse. Like I said before I really wanted to like this movie, I even spent the first hour making excuses and hoping for the best. At this point I am just hoping that they don't compound things by making a sequel.",Eragon

In my opinion I think everyone is being way too unimagative in watching the movie. What especially caught my attention was the battles and content because i think they just made a PG rating. I really did not like the killing of the ra'zac unlike the book. And Saphira looked great and so did the other special effects. What i loved was the great end battle between Durza and Eragon. So i suggest u go and pay full price at the theaters and give the filmmakers a break for there job. In the end, the film was just right for me and didn't need anymore story. I hope they make a movie of Eldest.",Eragon

The movie cuts so many scenes out and changes so many events, I can't even believe Christopher Paolini (author) even let them make it. Basically the entire trip from Carvahall to the Varden is taken out. No desert, no Terim, no Jeod, no nothing. Arya and Murtagh's roles are significantly different than the book. The Beor Mountains and the city inside Farthen Dur are less than impressive (and I'm being generous in stating that). Concerning the last quarter of the story with the Varden, there is no Orik, no twins, no huge sapphire that Saphira and Arya break through, no slide, no morning sage, no nothing. Also, the battle is completely different and not long enough. All in all, the story was incredibly rushed. In fact, it was so different, by the end of the movie when Saphira was seriously injured after battle, I honestly felt like they were going to kill her off.And to put it in perspective, the above is only a glimpse of what was changed and left out.Maybe if you haven't read the book, you will enjoy the movie. However, I doubt you will even know whats going on if you haven't read it.To sum up, I think so much more could have been done with this story, and believe it could have been made into a fantastic movie, but this idea of greatness was definitely not achieved.",Eragon
882,themowingmonk,Huge Disappiontment......,1,19 December 2006,"Normally for movies based on books, you never expect the movie to be as good as the book. but in this instance they are not even comparable. This movies was terrible. if you read the book then go see this movie your gonna be left in awe of how bad they messed up the story. they left out huge key parts of the movie, and change the way major events in the books happen. also leaving out many of the best character along with leaving the other races completely out. there isn't one dwarf in the whole movie. also the main elf in the movie Arya, she doesn't even have pointed ears, of all the basic details to give an elf you give them pointed ears, but shes looks just like a normal human in the movie. also the Urgals, large hairy horned warriors in the book get turn to fat balding guys in the movie. And most importantly of all, since when does saphira have feathers and fuzz, another thing that is totally different then how is was described in the book with the thin membranes for wings. i could go on and on about everything they messed up on in this movie but ill just leave it with this. if you've read the book and like it as much as i did don't even bother seeing the movie, you wont like it. and if you haven't read the book and you see the movie, you'll have a hard time figuring out whats going on because they leave out so much background information for the story and mush parts together so much that the movie almost doesn't make sense. overall i think this movie had a lot of potential and fell far short, and I'm sure I'm not the only Eragon fan that was sore disappointed by the movie.",Eragon

Eragon finds out he is a dragon rider then all of a sudden is a bad ass there is not even character development for him. Then the ending does not follow the book what-so-ever I wonder how they will make the second book into a movie they did none of the story that sets up for the second book Wragon does not even go with Arya when she leaves, Murtagh is not kidnapped and Ajihad is not killed.

It is evident that the budget was spent entirely on the animated dragon Saphira. Aside from horrible camera filters, bad acting by Edward Speelers, obvious bloopers and corny lines, this movie had almost NO claim to be like the book. The plot was twisted around and key elements to the sequel were left out entirely. Minor characters that are credited sometimes never even appear. I was shocked to see that characters like Brom, Murtagh, and the Razac had their appearances changed dramatically so that they wouldn't look like Lord of The Rings characters. Though they did this, the film still seemed like a horribly plagiarized version of Lord of The Rings. In conclusion,I would not recommend this movie to ANYONE I know, even people I hate.",Eragon

The monsters were scary and complicated and heroes were impressive. Everything worked.I don't think the screenwriter of this movie actually read the book. It is as if someone gave him or her a summary of the book with key parts left out, and the screenwriter rewrote the summary to come up with something that only remotely resembles the book.

I mean, whoa! Sienna as Arya? What the heck?! Even Hilary Duff or Brittney Spears could have been a better Arya than Sienna! She seems to have absolutely no personality or character in the movie, and she's blonde, not that I have a discrimination towards blonds, but Arya is most definitely not a blonde. And then. Ed as Eragon. Why didn't the director choose someone experienced for such a huge role? Ed just reads off lines, gets payed, and goes home. Absolutely shockingly horrible acting. I could go on and on, but I won't. I'll just daydream about choking the director. Ha, just kidding. But he did do a terrible job. The whole movie is too short, and everything is rushed through, with no explanations for many things. Most people sitting in the movie theater with me kept on going like, ""Huh?"" And the director skipped too many parts, and characters, like Orik. I just hope that if Hollywood decides to make Eldest (sequel of Eragon) into a movie, they'll choose a different director. As for the cast, that's set, and probably won't change. We'll just have to live with a blond Arya. All in all, I think the only thing about the movie that fit the book was Saphira's voice.

I mean for crying out loud, I won't even start on the changes from the book but that is too be expected with book to movie adaptations. But Eragon, although absolutely drop dead gorgeous should not be allowed to act unless in a comedy. The entire movie was overacted. It looked like he was trying to stretch his face as far as it could go. And the lines, cheesy beyond reason!! ""Into the sky to live or die!"" Holy cow I wanted both Saphira and Eragon to die at the end just so that no one would be able to ruin the sequel any more than it is. I mean they completely cut out the entire part that is supposed to tie into the sequel and be the base of the entire second book. And even though I have read the books, I was confused by the sequence of events so I can't imagine someone watching who hasn't read it! And the costumes! They put SEQUINS on Eragons collar in the last shot!! CHeesy!! What the metal bits in the armor weren't shiny enough! and the fact that Saphira helmet changes from what they originally show that the Varden spent all night making! Oh and Durza changes makeup about 3 times in the movie! ALmost like they couldn't decide how ugly to make him! DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!! But don't let this turn you away from the book!

888,any_minute_man,Disappointment,5,25 December 2006,"Needless to say that when I heard that an 'Eragon' movie was being released, I was a little skeptical as to how true to the book it would be. There was very little advertising up until about two before the movie premiered, and it would be very difficult to encompass something so in depth. Then, the day before I saw it, I discovered the film was only about an hour and a half long. However, I still remained hopeful and went to see it. My fears however, were realized. The film not only lacked multiple key plot points, but the stuff from the book that was put into it was skewed and completely twisted around. I think the only thing that didn't change were the names of the characters. The film was also rather cheesy. I understand that it was made from a book a book meant for children, but still, I was expecting perhaps maybe a tad more maturity. At first I really wanted this movie to succeed that that others could be made the second and third books, but now, I'd rather it just tank and I'll enjoy the books with own imagination.",Eragon

Clichéd storyline, poor acting and not enough screen time for John Malkovich, who, in my opinion, is a good actor and may have been able to save the film. It doesn't feel ""big"" enough in the way LOTR was ""epic"". Maybe the next 2 will improve my opinion, but it's doubtful. The author is obviously a geek, and his ""farmboy to saviour"" journey of he main character is hardly believable. Sorry Eragon producers - you have missed the mark with this film. Any 1980's fantasy film easily eclipses Eragon in both storyline and overall experience.",Eragon
890,green-burn-1,I am disappointed to say the least....,5,17 December 2006,"I'm a big fan of the book, having read it more times than i can count, and probably the sequel yet more. i was thrilled when they said they were making a movie of it too. that was before i saw it. Roran will desperately need re-casting, and whoever wrote the script needs stoning. the whole movie was riddles with rubbish one-liners and soppy emotional stuff, the book is nothing like this. sure it was a nice fantasy film for those who can count their age on one hand, but it's not the book. it wasn't even, like in LOTR, where they had to skip out on some things to fit it into three hours, it was more, ""Lets make a completely different storyline"" and i'm sure other Eragon novel fans will agree Arya isn't this imposter actress,It's a nice film, but its not the book",Eragon
891,Kolob64,I saw a screening last night,9,12 December 2006,"This movie must be taken as its own story independent of the book. If they had been totally faithful to the book the movie would have been way too long. Where the book meanders, the movie is more fast paced and action filled.Brom was fabulous and stole the show. Jeremy Irons was totally inspired in his performance. Ed is OK, good enough and much better than I had expected after seeing the promotional stills. Saphira is wonderful although my daughter was less happy with how she had changed from the book. The baby Saphira was very cute and very dragony.Unlike most modern movies, these producers kept the movie short enough at under two hours. I was very grateful not to have it go on too long. Lots of it was beautiful and worth seeing on a big screen in a decent theater. The theater at FOX was perfect, picture, sound, comfy seats, everything. When I pay to see a show I go to digital theaters with good sound, they are worth paying for to have a good movie experience.Many characters and scenes were left out. I think it best to see the movie before reading the book.",Eragon
892,juve26,It's a shame to waste your time,3,21 December 2006,"First of all, i expected, as many others i presume, much more from this movie. When you see the cast (like Malkovich and Irons) you assume that it's going to be an experience to watch them lead you through the story. But, sadly, no. Malkovich is nowhere to be seen and Irons is great, as always, up until the very easy entry and mess up of Eragon. Secondly, what was with the Corny lines and the voice of the 'Dragon'. Isn't suppose to be at least tougher voice. Maybe a Man...why not. And the Corny lines finished me, i must admit.I couldn't stand the Cliché lines and responses between the Dragon and Eragon. It was very cheap. Don't even get me started on the army sent to destroy the rebels' town, or whatever. very poor. At the end you realize that nobody told the actual story of the Dragons and the past and the events were changing as in Fast Forward. But on the other hand there were some good effects, like the Dragon, and the flying, and the flame... and that's it. All in all, It's a shame to waste your time for this movie. believe me.",Eragon
893,singerchick103,9 stars and 2 thumbs up!!!,9,17 December 2006,"Wow....wow. This is one of the best fantasy movies I have seen. I absolutely loved it! Yes, it is a lot like Star Wars and Lord of the Rings combined, but it is very very VERY good. I totally recommend seeing this movie. The actors do a fine job and the graphics are perfect and so realistic (especially Saphira, the dragon). Edward Speelers did an incredible job as Eragon--and it's his first movie! The people who write bad comments about this movie don't know what they're talking about. However I am NOT going to say they are on drugs. Now, I don't know how close it is to the book. I haven't read it, but I am planning to immediately. But even if the movie isn't anything like the book, it is great as a separate thing. Does that make sense? The only thing I know that's different is, in the movie, Arya's hair is red, but in the book, her hair is black. That's not really a big deal though. I mean it's just hair color and the actress, Sienna Guillory, does a great job as Arya anyway so you won't care.The reason I gave it 9 out of 10: I think it did borrow too much for SW and LOTR. But all the originality totally makes up for it. What are you waiting for? Drive out to the theater and see it already! I am definitely buying Eragon when it comes out on DVD.",Eragon
894,plallas,What a mess!,4,13 December 2006,"I have been waiting for this film for quite a while and as many other fantasy films it has been such a big disappointment. Poor Paollini, I really feel for you. It must be really hard to see your brainchild been mutilated and butchered on the big screen. OK down to business. First of all there is absolutely no character development whatsoever. Get used to this comment guys and girls, you are going to hear it a lot about this movie. A HUGE part of the book is condensed to about half an hour towards the end of the movie. Major characters are only introduced by name, important events are skipped altogether and information that is absolutely necessary for someone to understand the movie is left out. Performances are decent and special effects are excellent but that does not change the fact that it all happens so fast and so clumsily that I was left watching the climatic battle at the end of the movie without knowing who are they fighting for. Oh one last thing. Have you ever seen an elf without pointy ears? Well if you watch this movie you will. Arya, the major elf character of the movie has NO pointy ears(at the end when she is saying her goodbyes to Eragon you can clearly see that her ears are very human)!!! Unbelievable, come on guys I cant believe that no one in production noticed that.",Eragon
895,mad2241,Entertaining if you haven't't read the book,4,14 December 2006,"The movie itself would be entertaining enough if you haven't read the book but otherwise it will be a disappointment, to put it lightly, so if you like Eragon don't ruin the series for you, give this a miss.With a storyline that greatly differs from the story and sub-par acting the movie has very little going for it, besides the beautiful background scenery, which unfortunately doesn't extend to the shanty like cities. With 4 script writers you would really expect something more... acceptable. Trust me, there's something better on at the movies - watch that or stay at home.",Eragon
896,radagastbombadil,A boy named Eragon finds a dragon egg which later hatches. He learns he is a dragon rider and that he and his dragon must stop the reign of an evil king.,2,17 January 2007,"When I first heard of the Eragon movie, I was thrilled because I had enjoyed reading both books. But after seeing the movie, I was disappointed and was wondering why Fox 2000 even considered MAKING this piece of junk. It was really terrible.As a movie in general, it had some of the poorest sound quality and some of the poorest acting. Jeremy Irons was the only good actor in here, but then again, he only lasts for about half of the movie. Then there are certain things that don't make sense and/or have no purpose. There was no point in putting Angela in this movie, especially when you can't understand her when she tells Eragon's fortune. Or how does Brom keep up w/Saphira while riding a horse that's BARELY GALLOPING!?!? Also, it did the book NO JUSTICE. Angela's role is much more important in the book, the Ra'zac (which looked really lame) were not supposed to be killed, and the Urgals looked like those guys from the Middle Ages version of the Capital One Commercials, and they looked human! Where were their horns. This movie also leaves out the dwarfs, whom the Varden were supposed to be staying with. Actually, Hrothgar the Dwarf King was there, but you'll think that he was a short human, not a dwarf. Plus, there was no character development, so you don't know much about any of the characters. Plus, I was positive that Eragon actually mentioned Durza's name (one of the bad guys) BEFORE HE WAS SUPPOSED TO KNOW WHO HE WAS!!!! That being said, this was a poorly made movie that should never have been put into incompetent hands.",Eragon
897,jayne_taylorwaters,Nice movie - if you haven't read the book.,4,14 December 2006,"I gave the movie four out of ten, because Roran was an Australian actor (1), Sapphira looked beautiful :) (2), Eragon was pretty cute for a boy (3), and, of course, one for the road (4).The movie missed too many integral parts of the story. My daughter was devastated - she is boycotting any further movies about Eragon and is sticking to the books.The makers of this movie tried to put too much into too short a time frame. The whole thing was rushed and seemed more like a summary of the book than an epic fantasy.One of the saddest things was the death of Brom. It all happened so quickly (and differently to the book) that it wasn't even that sad. I didn't spill a tear - and that is from a person that cried when Charlotte died in Charlotte's Web!!!! This movie didn't give you the time to fall in love with any of the characters.Overall, because my daughter and I are such fans of the book, Eragon the movie was a bitter disappointment. I feel really sorry for the author.",Eragon
898,jonesco-2,Bab bad bad bad bad bad 0=Eragon,2,14 December 2006,I just suffered through Eragon and now I am on my way to being drunk. They casted several great actors but failed to use them. The director and screenwriter should be taken out back and shot. Actors could have been great it could have a Harry Potter or LOTR but no Fox wanted to save money and shove a 497pg book into an hour and a half story. I mean who needs character development? I mean this isn't a movie its a slide show of special effects. I think I'm going to wander in traffic...Truly I believe that Fox believe they could back a LOTR without spending as much money. The actors you can tell are much better than what is shown in Eragon. But they thought that graphics are more important than character development. I mean two Academy Award winners are in the film and they cannot save the film. To show how bad this film is there is one scene in the movie where Eragon has no bow the next seen he has one?,Eragon
899,argetlam345,"Good book, bad movie",4,15 December 2006,"I am a big fan of the books as my name suggests, but the movie was a disgrace to the books. The special effects were good but most of the acting was terrible. Paolini must have been banging his head against the wall after seeing this movie. About 3/4 of the plot was missing. It was not accurate to the book either. Some of the places they visited were left out and one very important part was missing. Some of the events that happened even occurred in the wrong city! It was a bad movie based off of a good book. When I was in the theater some people were even laughing during the ""serious"" parts.

This movie is the poorest example of a movie produced from an excellent book that I have ever seen. It's really like the people who made the movie never read the book, or worse picked a few details and wrote another book around the details. The time lines were completely forgotten and basically the entire plot was changed from an excellent plot in the book. Major character interaction is completely missing. Some of the most endearing characters are missing. The different species of characters from the book are indistinguishable in the movie. How hard can it be to put pointed ears on an elf??? How hard is it these days to portray the dragon as it is in the book. ie. Dragon wings NOT bird wings!!!I wish the author of the book much success as he is certainly very talented, but should he chose to have a movie made from his next book, let's hope he chooses more wisely as to who produces and directs it!",Eragon

Brom does not teach eragon with the little stone... Rohan just ""goes away"" for no reason. Where is his girlfriend? The twins are not included in the film, the dwarf does not rescue Eragon.Eragon does not see Arya by the dream-view accidentally, but Durza calls for eragon in the film. They do not cross the dessert and there are no more than 10 short sentences between Murthag and Eragon. Eragon is not hurt from Durzas sword, he doesn't seem to have any harm at all.The story is totally ununderstandable.......Conclusion: EVERYTHING IS MESSED UP!

This is a movie that was put together too quickly so that someone could pocket some easy money.If you have read the book, you will be extremely displeased with the movie. The construction of Saphira was not even close. Feathered wings???????

The storyline that the movies follows is so skewed and out of whack that i would be embarrassed if i were the director and especially the person who wrote the script. The acting was mediocre, and the characters had no depth, and so many things were left out that for those who have read the books and LOVE them (as i do) were left wondering how everything was happening so fast.. and I'm not sure about the casting- i didn't care for who they picked to play Eragon (nothing about him as an actor, to me, embodies what Eragon was in the book)... all in all it was a disappointment and it saddens me that such a beautifully colorful and imaginative book like Eragon could be butchered so easily.",Eragon
905,jaaydenh,The worst movie in the fantasy genre in recent times,1,15 December 2006,The one redeemable quality the movie could have had was the dragon but then even messed that up by having a horrible voice for the dragon. Watching the movie was like watching a 1 hour and 40 minute long preview since there was rarely a chance to even grasp what was even going on at all. This movie screams low budget as many of the scenes show a sword that is supposedly magical but really just looks like it is covered with red paint. The movie does not stay true to the book at all and there was zero character development except for the lead character eragon who was the worst character in the movie. The story is supposed to be a trilogy but i seriously hope that it ends here because this movie is definitely giving the genre a bad name. I will just have to wait for the Hobbit.,Eragon

Even the TWINS the TWINS i tell you have been missed out.Is arya an elf? i don't know you tell me the film certainly doesn't.

Saphira can breath fire so early that all the urgals set alight and die in the opening salvos of the battle.Oh and did i mention that durza now has some sort of dragon!!!?!?!?!?!why oh why did they do this? it doesn't need to be so short that i can watch it before I've finished my popcorn!

My first mistake was reading the book first and my second mistake was going to the theater. Talk about rushing though and give you nothing. Of course most movies don't follow a book but they stick with the same basic story line. I think Christopher thought he'd try and make it along the lines of Lord of the Rings. Too bad for him because he killed a perfect story and let down his fans. Greed kills and this movie isn't far behind!!! My advice to you is don't read the book first! I can only say that I'm glad I went to the matinée show though I was tempted several times to walk out. I guess I could say thank you to Christopher Paolini for saving me $30 because. I have no intention of buying the DVD nor will I go back to the theaters for any sequel that may follow. I'll do what I always do when I hear of a crappy movie. I'll wait till it comes on TV and ""if"" there is nothing else on then I may watch it. What a let down, so upset now don't even know if I'll buy book 3 (if it ever comes out)!

I was just hoping it would be enjoyable and visually appealing. It was neither. This movie was so bad that the audience was laughing at points clearly not meant to be funny--like when Baby Saphira, at this point large hawk sized, flies for the first time and returns as a full sized talking dragon. The dialog was painful, the sarcasm between Saphira and Eragon from the book was entirely missing from the movie, and the plot didn't entirely make sense despite being painfully simplified. For some reason, the film looks dated, as if it had been filmed in the early 1980s. Behind Battlefield Earth, second worst movie I've ever seen.",Eragon

There were four of us attending, ages 9 (daughter), 11 (son), 22 (my hubby) and 35 (me, the wife)... We all enjoyed it for different reasons. No, we weren't totally blown away (well, my daughter thought it was fabulous, and wants a dragon), but no one was disappointed either. Of course, none of us have read the book, so we were simply judging what we had seen for ourselves, and we had no preconceived notions about what it should be.But, the special effects were pretty cool to watch, the scenery was beautiful, costuming was pretty cool and the fight scenes were exciting to watch (and my husband & I liked that Friesian that Irons rode).

Trying to cram what should be a 2.5 to 3 hour movie into a reckless, plot less hour and a half.20th Century Fox should either have put more money into making it or they are wondering what the money they did spend bought them. The writers should be taken out back and buried for the crap they turned an OK book into. Christopher Paolini better have gotten a great deal for the movie rights, cause he has to be kicking himself after seeing that movie.I almost believe this is worst than Dungeons and Dragons movie and most people didn't even know they made that into a movie. This movie hopefully has the same fate. Unfortunately they are hoping an audience will sit through two more of this drivel. Hopefully the paying public will take a stand and send the next movies straight to video where they belong.

One scene in particular is when Saphira(the dragon) spontaneously ages from a hatchling to a fully grown dragon in the space of a few minuets.The music and effects for were good, songs fitted the scenes, nothing out of time or anything.

912,mel_is_crazy,So Disappointed ...,1,15 December 2006,"The story of Eragon was butchered and mangled beyond recognition. One wonders whether the script writers have even read the original books, they definitely had no appreciation for the masterpieces they are. This movie was an atrocity and a shameful representation of the life's work of Christopher Poalini. There was absolutely no character development, major pieces of the novel were skipped over, and important characters were left out or twisted into dull lifeless shadows of what they should have been.

It was so obvious the movie had very little funding, because they skipped over everything, and what they did manage to include was done WRONG. The entire political battle was removed, so anyone who did not read the novels was completely lost. It was so mangled that they should not have even done the movie at all. Almost all of the characters were done incorrectly. This movie was immoral; it failed to do the book and author justice. The creators of this film mocked, ridiculed, scorned, disrespected, tortured, and plain out DESTROYED the novel and the author. It is so plainly obvious that Christopher Paolini had practically nothing to do with the creation of this film. They took advantage of a young but talented author and ruined his books. I am enraged and disgusted by this film. It was a waste of time and money, as well as months of excitement. Paolini deserves much more than what was done; this film was an abomination.",Eragon
914,callison-7,my son loved it,9,15 December 2006,"Excellent cinema it is not, however it was adventure packed, exciting, fairly easy to follow and not terribly scary. It was very easy for my son to tell the ""bad guys"" from the ""good guys"" so there were very few ""what's that? who's that? what are they doing?"" questions. There were also no gory sequences or overly suspenseful chases. My four year old son who had nightmares for weeks from watching Monster House (also rated PG) declared that this movie didn't scare him at all. At 104 minutes I felt sure that neither of my kids would actually sit through the entire film, however both my 4 year old son and my 2 year old daughter sat through until the end. As for the special effects, the dragon (and story for that matter) were as good as most other dragon fare out there- DragonQuest, Dragonheart 1 and 2, etc. The dragon looked to be completely CGI so there were no awkward animatronic scenes. Even the flying sequences looked to me like they were as good as the flying in the first Harry Potter Quidditch games. And possibly the best part of all- it is a kid movie that as far as I've seen has no merchandising attached to it! So instead of rushing over to the toy store, both kids flew their imaginary dragons all the way home. All in all, I count this movie as a resounding success for the 10 and under age group.",Eragon
915,Budinski11-1,Horrible Transition To Movie,2,15 December 2006,"This movie was crazy bad. I read the book, and aside from the movie having the same characters, very little of the story is the same. It's as if the script writer was writing from spark notes, but spilled his coffee on them and filled in the blank spots with whatever he felt like. They didn't include the three major races (the dwarfs looked to be very slightly shorter people but other than that, they were not mentioned). If they are going to continue the movies on into the series, I can't see how they will be in any way consistent, although that hasn't seemed to matter up to this point. Public outcry will surely persuade the filmmakers to reconsider the release of the second film. I personally am willing to say, if something is not changed, I will not be attending.",Eragon

As an Eragon book fan, i found myself struggling to sit through this movie. It mixed up events (the Razaac chasing Eragon & Brom when in the book it was the other way around... Durza Killing Brom, when in the book it was the Razaac, and so on...), cut out events (Tierm was completely erased form the movie, and many key characters like the Varden's magic using twins and Orik the dwarf who accompanies Eragon throughout book two as well as being his guide throughout tronjheim in book one, and so on...) added new events (the fight scene at the end with Saphira and Eragon fighting Durza & his beast and Saphira getting her neck injured severely, which never occurred in the book, Eragon kills durza because Saphira causes Durza to lose focus by smashing through a giant diamond...). The locations throughout the movie were horrible, with my example being Tronjheim, the dwarf city, too many details were left out and the sets looked small and unrealistic. Also, the movie moved very fast because it being only 100 minutes it had too much information to fit in to too short of a running time. At times i found it to be very confusing and the only reason i knew what was happening was because i have read the books and am very familiar with the story. I would suggest to anyone who is relatively interested in this story to read the book and not see this movie, it is a disgrace to the book.",Eragon
917,umustright,Big Disappointment,2,15 December 2006,"I'd been excited about this movie for a long time, as I've read the books twice and really enjoyed the creativity of the story, as well as the rich characters. Several things made this movie a walk-out (which is exactly what I did): 1) It seems only several points of the book were used as guidelines for the movie and all the filler in between was fabricated from some story other than Eragon. There are many hunt/flee action movies out there, but the beauty of this book belonged to some major details which were completely neglected by the movie (such as the fact that Eragon was hunting the Razac, not the other way around, that Brom never wanted to take Eragon to the Varden, or that Arya was never actually conscious during the greater part of Eragon, or the fact that Eragon was never ordered to be killed by the king.) 2) The dialogue seemed awkwardly pieced together. The movie would jump from scene to scene with out any good flow, leaving the film choppy and distracting.3) There really only seemed to be two races: Humans and Dragons. Arya, who is supposed to be an elf, showed no physical attributes of one. Durza did not have any traits of a shade (except maybe fore some scary chapped lips towards the end of the film). The dwarfs were missing...4) Finally, the set was awful. In particular was Galbatorix' layer which basically was a big red sheet on the wall with a fancy chair. No one was every in the room with him except for Durza, making it seem he was living in some cave. Also, this man is supposed to be so powerful and evil, but gives barely any impression of it with his lack of feelings and dispassionate outlook on most situations that came before him.My advice would be to go out and buy the book. You'll be far more entertained and won't have to spend $18 on something that's ""rental"" quality at best.",Eragon

I heard many people say that it's the new Lord of the Rings. People, do not be deceived. The story of Eragon is in a sense, correct. The way the story unfolds however is just... wrong. I've read the book at least three times. Every character portrayed in the book is made out to be a fool in the movie. Urgals are fat guys trying to act tough. Elves aren't graceful at all. Dragons have feathers and hair (though the graphics were pretty good). Dwarfs are called dwarfs for a reason, because they're short. In the movie they're man-dwarfs. Even having read the book, I still found it extremely hard to get into the movie and found it even more hard to keep up as the story unfolded so quickly that Eragon went to a farm boy to a great ""Dragon Rider"" who could use magic and was greater than the elves already in 99 minutes.

I don't think the makers of this film actually read the book. I think someone told them the story; they forgot most of it and made up some stuff to fill in. The movie has no sense of continuity. Events were scrambled; characters flew in and out of this film. If I hadn't read the book I would not even have been able to guess whom these people were. You certainly can't figure out who they are by the costume designers impressions (they must not have read the book either) Don't the Ra'zac have beaks and wore capes to hide their bug eyes? Where was Sloan's daughter, which is the whole reason Roran starts his own quest to save her later. Where was the child that was blessed, again important character to be added later??? Murtaugh - He was supposed to be an important friend to Eragon. Didn't he have a lot to do with killing the shade? Where's the Isidar Mithrim. Arya is unconscious during the ride to Varden not talking and making eyes at Eragon. The most troubling character assassination for me was Angela. They took this fun and quirky person and made her an Egyptian style fortuneteller - sad, just sad.... My 3 rating is as high as it is for the special effects. They were phenomenal. Saphira was amazing. Also for the occasional good one liner (picture first flight and Saphira says ""you are being ridiculous"" as he is hanging from her foot) Bottom line if you read or plan to read the book - Don't see the movie. I won't be going to the sequel.",Eragon
920,thatkid77,Ughhh....give to Peter Jackson!!!,1,15 December 2006,"OK, so i just got back from Eragon, it stunk!Eragon was trying to do a very cheesy English accent, while Durza, his face crumbling slowly tried to find eragon. if you read the books you will notice they left out Tierm, Katrina, the Raz-Ac shouldn't have died, Brom got killed by the Ra-Zac in the book...not Durza. Angela was supposed to be in the Varden as well, and to fight in the end battle, which looked like a mosh pit. The twins were not in the varden, murtagh was supposed to ""die"" and durza was supposed to die in a different way which is too long to type. Oh yes and when Eragon kills Durza, we are supposed to see some of Durza's past, and how he became a shade...and last but not least Eragon was supposed to bless a child, which fails terribly. Give the idea to Peter Jackson and he will do marvelous!!!",Eragon
921,turtlerock3,Not worth the $$,2,15 December 2006,"This is a good movie if you just want to go see a movie with a cool dragon in it. However, if you go to see the book come to life, you will be extremely disappointed. The book I read has only the name in common with this movie. I realize that movies face time constraints that books don't have to worry about, but way too much is left out. The movie barely gets to 95 minutes, (which is the usual length of a Disney film), so there is no time for character development. Lord of the Rings proved that 3 hours is not too long for a film, and this film could have easily used the extra time to make the characters believable and likable. I sure hope Christopher has more control over any future movies. I would hate to have the same people get control over Eldest!",Eragon
922,redsoxsweety,what in the world is this!!!,3,15 December 2006,"I walked into the theatre with the highest expectations for this movie ever and was absolutely thrilled about being able to see it. But then I saw it and I wanted to cry! What was that!!! First off, I have read the book and am currently on the second because I absolutely LOVED it! But did the people who made this movie read it at all???? It defiantly didn't seem that way! They cut out WAY to many things and the only good special effect was the dragon Saphira but that was it! I am infuriated at this movie! OK first, Eragon isn't even 16 in the book, not 17 as it said in the movie, and he is supposed to be sleeping when the egg starts to hatch. What happened to Sloan's daughter who Roran loves and him going off to make a life for them not get away from the army? What happened to the child Eragon blessed which will be a big part in the 2ed book? What happened to the big saphire star thing Arya breaks?? And speaking of the end, Eragon does not fight the shade on the smoke dragon thing, but in that room place, plus the shade doesn't bring the army, and the shade slices Eragon on the back, then Saphira and Arya come to help, and what was with the sword? It looked plastic with a bit of red paint. Brom wasn't that mean in the book and he told Eragon about the dragons, and the farm is already burnt and what happened to Horst???? Eragon also brings Garrow back to be healed! The Ra'zac have beaks and cloaks! They don't look like half eaten bodies with bugs all over them, lord of the ring play-offs! Eragon and Murtagh were hot and good (everyone was good actors) but no one looked the part except them and Saphira! Where's Broms beard and what in the world did you do to Angela!!! She was so quirky and funny and fun, but the movie presented her as some weird Egyptian play-off person. What happened to the town with the people the urgals killed because that's where Eragon kills them with the arrows (the Urgals looked totally wrong as well) and what happened to the other town where Angela and Broms merchant friend are suppose to be at, and what happened to the werecat??? He was suppose to warn them when they are searching through the scrolls for the ra' zac which, by the way, is the whole reason Eragon and Brom set off in the first place, not to go to the Vardan which is what Brom is against! And Brom gets killed by the Ra'zac not the shade and that's where Eragon finds out Broms a rider. Not before! Broms life is a big secret not all laid out as it was in the movie! Also, they showed nothing of the practice Brom and Eragon did with swords, sticks, and magic and Eragon didn't seem to get tired from using magic as he should have. Plus, we didn't even basically see anything of the Varden which was something I was very much looking forward to, and what happened to Orik? He was nowhere, nor was the twins and Ajihad's daughter plays a big role in the seconded book, but you don't even know who she is in the movie. Also, Murtagh and Eragon were supposed to be good friends and Murtagh rescued Eragon and Arya from the prison ( Arya also was supposed to be unconscious during the whole ride to the Vardan!) and he was the one who shot the shade with an arrow, and his cut was supposed to be on his back, and he was supposed to be kept in a nice place at the Vardan and tell Eragon that he was Morzans son and fight and spar with Eragon! Plus they were suppose to take a long time to get to the Vardan and Murtagh is suppose to be against going to the Vardan the whole time! The shades eyes were supposed to be red, (even though he did look good,) and Aryas hair was supposed to be black, and wear black leather. Also, Angela is supposed to be at the Vardan when Eragon's there, and Eragon is supposed to be there for a while, not get there and then all of the sudden have to fight, and the Urgal's come up from the tunnels, not through the wall. And King Galbatorix isn't shown at all in the book, just talked about, but he is shown multiple times in the movie. I have MUCH more to say, but I fear it would take like a billion pages. Bottom line, read the book, don't see the movie.",Eragon
923,bloodlust67,What a monumental waste of time and money!!!,1,15 December 2006,"So... there's cute little Saphira flying through the clouds, then ZAP!!! She's full grown!!! As soon as that happened I knew the movie was ruined. Here is a list of even more things wrong with this pathetic Hollywood adaptation of a great novel (i.e. every Stephen King novel made into a movie with the exception of The Stand): 1. Saphira instantly grows up while flying around.2. Roran was only in the movie for about 5 minutes. He left home as a draft dodger, not to work at the blacksmith (or whatever) to make money to marry Katrina.3. Murtaugh was only in the movie about 5 minutes. He seemed excited about going to meet the Varden, when actually he dreaded it in the book.4. Arya was portrayed as human (no pointy ears, or almond shaped eyes, or angled eyebrows). Arya was dark haired in the book, but blond in the movie. With all the money they spent making this movie, they couldn't afford a box of Clairol for her to dye her hair??? She also seemed to flirt and fawn on Eragon, where in the books she avoided him and was very strict about NOT getting involved. she did, afterall, destroy the magical drawing he made for her. Also she appeared to take great pleasure in the fact that she is an Elven Princess, when in the book she kept it a secret until the Queen exposed her in front of her friends.5. Where was Hrothgar? or Orlik? or the rest of the dwarfs??? they weren't even MENTIONED in the movie!!! if not for the dwarfs, Eragon and Saphira and even Arya would not have made it out of Trondjheim alive!!! they were entirely too important to the storyline to be so casually omitted from the movie.6. What happened to Eragon and Saphira going to Ellesmera for their training??? how is it Eragon learned 3 or 4 words from Brom then suddenly can start slinging magic like a cafeteria lady slings lumpy mashed potatoes?!!?! And when he fought Durza, he never got the debilitating wound on his back. Also, Eragon got his sword Zar'roc from Brom in the movie, where in the book he took it from Durza after he killed him.There is way too much more to list that is wrong with this movie. Didn't Christopher Paolini read the screenplay BEFORE he signed the contract for this movie deal??? In my opinion, he is a sellout and let the prospect of making more money from his story get in the way of preserving it. I will NOT waste another penny of my money on another movie adaptation or book of his. I will find somebody that has a free used copy of the last book of the Trilogy and read it then.",Eragon
924,tylerjnk,"Good Movie, Stands on it own.",8,15 December 2006,"As a movie Eragon is good, Speeler is rough around the edges but a good looking kid and will grow to be and outstanding star. The graphics are excellent. Very different from the book which is understandable with the time constraints. Many twists leave you stunned but some are better than the original. Most disappointing was probably that Arya's elven strengths were not displayed in the movie which made her a minor character along with the dwarfs.Look forward to the Eldest version but I hope the Elves and Dwarfs are emphasized more. The wonder of this story is that it is about four races not just one(five if you include Urgals). And it should be remembered that the Dragons are as,if not more, intelligent as the humans.",Eragon
925,morgalblade,A major disappointment to a fan of the books,2,16 December 2006,"I saw this movie today, opening day, and I was almost instantly disappointed. The character development is horrible and it appeared that the writers did not read the book in detail or just decided to write to appease 4- 9 year olds. There are so many things wrong about this movie, I would exceed the 1000 word limit for this review. Also, many major events were removed and some were crushed together with others( Angela's part, which happened in Yazuac in the movie, was in Tierm in the book, which was completely cut out).I will now begin to list out the major mistakes and cutouts.Spoilers ahead, BEWARE!1. The farm was not destroyed in the movie, it was in the book. 2. There were no soldiers in Carvahall, forcing people to fight. 3. Katrina was not even mentioned or shown and this is going to make it hard in the next film to explain. 4. Galbatorix has not had any lines in the books to date and does not learn of Eragon until later in the book, whereas in the movie, it is discovered almost instantly. 5. At almost all points in the movie, they are surrounded by mountains, whereas in the book, they travel across open plains frequently. 6. The 'shining palm' is not portrayed as a lump of silver skin, as it is in the book. 7. There is no rant from Shaphira in the beginning of the book about ""Oath breakers, murderers!"" and so on. Her flight with Eragon into the mountains is not shown, thus making little sense how the Ra'zac could have gotten to the farm faster than Shaphira to non reader moviegoers. 8. Galbatorix is portrayed as a warlord, not a king. He lives in the largest city of men, Uru- Baen, but is shown as a huge fortress, no city. 9.Brom is NOT killed by Durza, but from taking a knife thrown by the Ra'zac for Eragon. 10. Dras- Leona is not included, and is important because shows were the dreaded beasts are from. 11. The whole hunt for where the Ra'zac's oil came from is not included. 12. Murtagh was never following Brom and Eragon. 13. The elves are not portrayed as Paolini's elves- stronger than humans, fairer, and more knowledgeable in magic, and also, where the heck were the elven ears! 14. The dwarfs hardly shown and the ones who were shown were as tall as the humans. This is Ovious when Hrothgar and Ajiad(forgot how to spell it) are standing next to each other. 15. Farthen- Dur is not portrayed as being inside a mountain, there was no crystal also. 16. What the heck was up with the fight with Eragon and Durza!!. Durza did not have a flying beast, Eragon received no back scar, and there was no sword fighting at all!! 17. There was no portrayal of the flight across the desert and Ayra was knocked out during the flight. 18. Some of the important side characters were not included. Orik and the twins are on this list. 19. None of Eragon's accidents are included in the movie.The list is by no means complete and could go on forever. I did not think it was possible to butcher a book so badly until I saw this. Those producers ripped the book to shreds and made a complete mockery of Paolini's works. I personally feel sorry for the following people: Christopher Paolini(How could you let them do this to your works!!!) Any fan of the book who went to see the movie(You WILL want the hour and a half of your life back) Irons and Malkovich (How could you let them make you look so bad!)( Congrats to Irons, you acted well, but for a lost cause)If you liked the book as I did, you will not like the movie, as I did. No fan of the book in their right mind would like this movie. Please don't waste your time with this movie, please.",Eragon
926,Yfree56,if u have not read the book it should be about a 5 as a movie itself but for all who have beware,2,16 December 2006,"the movie starts out good just like in the book but then they cut out everything, brom doesn't even say his famous quote ""may your swords stay sharp"". it was a true disappointment, also ( this might be considered a spoiler but if u read the book, but if u have you should take my advise and not waste ur time seeing it) the ending is nothing like the book. When i went in i new it was going to not be like the book at all kinda like Harry potter but, be warned this is nothing like the book. oh and the urgals don't look like anything that i pictured. further more there are no dwarfs in the film, and farthen dur is some valley. also the shad in the last seen is riding some dark thing, and there is no twins, Catrina, and the roazac are killed in like two seconds, they did not die in the first or second book.",Eragon
927,thomas_n8,This movie was horrible,1,15 December 2006,"I don't know what they were thinking. My 6-year-old hated this movie. The Characters were 2 dimensional with no soul. The villains sucked and what happened to the Ugals, Dwarfs and Elves. I could have made a better movie a slow chimp could have made a better movie. The Author of this Book should be very mad for what they did to a very good story. The Director and the man that did the Screen play should be asking everyone that saw this movie to forgive this sorry attempt. I mean how on earth do you take a really good story and turn it into one of the worst movies I have ever seen. This movie is as bad as Blood Rayne. The Cg was good the story stalled several times and maybe it was the Theater that I saw it in but I could hardly see what was going on the scenes were so dark.",Eragon
928,boizadoreme16,Horrible,1,15 December 2006,"I read Eragon and loved it. When I found out they were coming out with a movie I was so excited. I couldn't wait to see what all the characters looked like and how they were going to show Eragons adventures. Then the day came and instead of enjoying the movie I hated it. I thought it was horrible. First of all it was way to short, important scenes were cut out, and a whole race of people were cut out. Characters didn't look like what I expected them to look like. They also didn't show Eragons adventures and what he learned on the way to the Varden. In the book they described his journeys as being very long and in the movie they were only a day. Special effects were also very bad and i really don't suggest you go and see this movie. They could have easily made this movie at least another hour longer and covered everything thing in the book in the correct order. So my opinion is that you don't go see this movie but still read the book if you haven't yet. Its a very well written book that i suggest you all read.",Eragon
929,baddog_76,"Terrible movie, not even close.",1,15 December 2006,"This movie was Absolutely awful. The movie did not even come close to being on track with the book. There are so many different things in this movie. It was not worth the money to go see. They leave out major parts that piece the puzzle together. They rushed through everything. If you have ever read the book/s you will be absolutely appalled with it. They changed half of what the characters look like and just ruin the plot. I gave this movie a 1 because after the first 15 minutes I was ready to walk out. I give a fair warning to every fan of this book, or even if you just want to go see a new movie. Do not see it. Go see the new Bond movie instead.",Eragon
930,hrransom,It was horrible.,1,15 December 2006,"I am not even sure they read the book before they made the movie. It looks to me like they took the characters names and made their own storyline with it entirely. They changed key scenes left out others entirely, and then tried to put a chick flick turn on it. They give you no time frame of events through the entire movie so you are left guessing how long anything has been going on. They altered the ending to a degree that it doesn't even come close to what actually happened. Some of the characters depicted had a complete lack of effect to them. It is as if they disregarded everything that made the book good except for the dragon itself. If you have read the book, you will be very upset at this movie.Otherwise the graphics were nice.",Eragon
931,jupimakospam,"This movie was good imagery wise, but the dialog and plot should not have been changed so far from the original book.",7,15 December 2006,"I was quite surprised by this movie... good or bad... i'd have to see it again to really decide. The graphics were wonderful, and the dragon was cute, but the dialog was extremely cliché and sometimes almost painful to listen to. The movie went by extremely quickly, there was not a lot of plot between action scenes. Everything just flashed by so fast I'm glad I already knew what was happening. Besides that, the characters and different scenes had qualities extremely reminiscent of Star Wars, Harry Potter, and Lord of The Rings combined. I enjoyed the movie (Edward Speleers was a pleasure to look at and listen to XD), but I loved the book even more. The movie version was so bad it was good...",Eragon
932,m_lynn_ms,keep an open mind,7,15 December 2006,"I read a lot of very bad reviews on opening day. I took my kids in the evening anyway because we all read the book together. We weren't disappointed. The kids loved it and I enjoyed it too. The effects are good the backdrops are beautiful. It has some very charming moments that had not just my family, but the families around me giggling. The actors have some strong lines and good chemistry. On it's own it's a good movie. It's in comparing it with ""Eragon"" The book and ""Lord of the rings"" that has fans unhappy. If you go to watch it keep an open mind. Despite a few major changes from the book and lacking the all star cast of ""Lord of the rings"" the movie is still enjoyable.",Eragon
933,m-tane,terrible acting,4,15 December 2006,"I watched the movie and attempted to keep an open mind, but it was very difficult to do so. Eragon's acting debut was adequate at best, he over-acted with his voice and yet maintained only one single facial expression. The other main characters performed below average, it was almost laughable. However, Eragon's dragon displayed the most talent and it seems her performance was best...Brom's wasn't too bad either. It seems like all the budget went into creating the dragon, who was lovely, and not into hiring decent actors. Several characters were completely opposite in the movie as to how they are in the book, and many aspects of the plot are missing from the movie that were in the book too...aspects that will be important to the sequel. The best part of the movie was the magnificent scenery. And that's it.",Eragon
934,billabongtom,Great MOVIE!,9,15 December 2006,"I believe that this movie, was a well put together movie in it's own rate.. You can't compare a Dragon to a Hobbit for the people saying LOTRS is better, because they are both two different stories. For the people that enjoy a lot of magic in the first film, this isn't for you, because there is a actually story for the people that don't read the book before they watch the movie and then compare, those people just bother me cause they think everything should be they way they see it. The book of a movie, is the actual story, when a movie is just 1 mans interpretation. Why would you expect the movie to be exactly like YOU thought the book was.The movie was great, I'll definitely go see the sequel when it comes out.thanks.EDIT***And for the people that go to movies to dissect them, why don't you go watch the movie and enjoy it, instead of thinking about what you're going to say bad about it, cause honestly know one should really care about what you think of the difference between the actors, the director , other movies, and finally, the BOOK.",Eragon
935,Davepicc03,Terrible,3,15 December 2006,"This movie was a disgrace to the book. Eragon was possibly my favorite fantasy novel I have ever read, and the movie was awful in comparison. Too many things were changed and far too many left out. If you have intently read the book, you will realize how many crucial parts were left out. I think if the director had made the film longer and put a lot of the parts back in the movie would have been a lot better. For instance, the crucial battle was completely shortened and changed. It only took maybe 15 minutes which in my opinion is sickening. I walked out of the theater saddened and very disappointed. I wonder why Christopher Paolini allowed them to do this to his book.",Eragon
936,arrowmancer,If you haven't seen the movie: Read this.,10,15 December 2006,"This is probably one of the best adaptations I have ever seen. Condensing a story as broad and sweeping as Eragon is was a challenge but I think Mr. Fangmeier pulled it off nicely.If you read the reviews of Eragon, you'll notice that nearly everyone who read the books is upset. Please forgive them. After reading the books you'll understand as well. Still, turning Eragon into a movie is challenging and the director forced us all to focus on the raw spirit that Eragon engendered. Alone, the movie was excellent, provided the moviegoer had the mental and emotional maturity to follow and understand it. Apparently some special effects were sacrificed to support that which the director deemed important. On a limited budget, I believe he made the correct decisions. If you haven't seen the movie, I offer you this advice: If you've not read the books, watch the movie and let yourself get lost in it. You'll be reading the books before long.If you HAVE read the books, watch the movie, but remember: This movie, whether you like it or not, is now part of the Eragon lore. You already know it's not going to be as good as the book. You already know some things will not live up to your expectations, so focus GENERALLY on the spirit of Eragon and go into the theater with a fresh, open mind and allow yourself to get lost in experience.

937,FinalKingdom87,Eragon... They Totally Destroyed It!!!,4,15 December 2006,"i have read both books of the inheritance series. eragon and eldest were two of he best books i've ever read and the movie did not do it justice one bit. almost half the book seemed to be cut out of the movie and the whole movie seemed to be cast completely wrong. In my opinion the only thing done right was Sapheara (CGI, voice acting, etc), Jeremy Irons as Brom, and the actor cast as Durza. I didn't see enough of the actor playing Galbatorix to know but other than that the movie was a big disappointment. And ARYA? They didn't even give her the pointed elf ears, let alone mention that she WAS an elf! I couldn't believe how this movie was done. They had totally destroyed it.I don't know weather or not to hold out much hope for the second movie. I hope it gets better.",Eragon
938,Ocossin77,A real review for everyone from a fan...,2,16 December 2006,"Before I start this review off I will start by saying that I have read the books and the movie was very disappointing in my opinion. Also, I will split this up into 3 sections; the first will be for people that haven't read the books, a second for those who have, and a third for the overall conclusion. The second section will have spoilers in it, so if you haven't read the book I don't recommend passing the first section.Section 1: For People who haven't read the book. For those people who haven't read the books this movie I will recommend seeing the movie if you like fantasy stories with magic and dragons in them. This movie has great special effects and a great storyline. Sadly Hollywood has taken another victim and diced this story to hell and left nothing but the bare bones, and gave them back in the wrong order. If you are going to watch the movie and enjoy the main plot I recommend you go buy the book and find out what actually happened, in the right order, and in full. Although Eragon is a great story, this movie is filled with amateur actors, with amateur acting skills, and a rushed story line.Section 2: For people who have read the book. I do NOT recommend watching this film unless you want to be disappointed, or enjoy watching a good book be sliced into ribbons. The only thing that was good in the film was the special effects. This movie is filled with amateur actors, with amateur acting skills, and a rushed story line. The plot is in the wrong order and has added events, and many events taken out. I will make a list of everything that is wrong with the movie compared to the book, they won't necessarily be in order, but I think you will reconsider watching the movie after reading the list. If you are going to watch the film no matter what, don't bother to read the list and just find out how terrible Hollywood has torn apart the story line.The following contains spoilers that will give away Eragon the movie and book information and it is recommended to stop reading if you haven't read the book.Due to a word limit, I have posted a list of 40 items that might change your mind about watching this film. There are a lot more than 40 things wrong with this film but I'm sure you wouldn't want to read more. The address is: http://www.scroachage.com/Eragon/problemlist.htmEnd of Spoiler.Section 3: Conclusion I would list more but I'm sure that is enough to convince you that the story has been hacked into pieces. Hollywood did to Eragon what Jack the Ripper did to prostitutes. Like I said, I do not recommend watching this film to people who have read the books, even though it is based off of an excellent book. I give it a 1/10 for being accurate with the book, but a 7/10 for special effects because they could of done better to make the cities and the mountains look as they were described in the book. All-in-all it was a good movie, but only for those who haven't read the books. Also, if you did watch the movie without reading the book, I highly recommend reading the books to find out what actually happened. Overall: 3/10 for people who have read the books, 8/10 for people that haven't.-0cossin77",Eragon
939,the_teen,Uggggggggghhhhhhhhhhhhh,2,16 December 2006,WHY?????????? OK I am a HUGE fan of the Inheritence Trilogy and was expecting a lot out of this movie for all the hype but it was AWEFULL!!!!!! The story was good but it lacked in any depth to even connect you emotionally with any of the characters. It moved through the whole story faster than any movie I have ever seen. I was with some people who had never read the books and they were really bored the whole time. It lacked anything to keep you interested. We just had fun listening to how Peter Buchman (the screenplay writer) rewrote almost every line in the the book to make everything dramatic but what more can you expect from a guy whose only movie he has written is Jurassic Park 3! ANd yes the special effects were great (although Im still not sure why Saphira had feathered wings) of course they will be great when the only experience your director has is special effects supervisor for a lot of great movies. Over all I would say the acting was fine but VERY misguided and the lines horribly adapted. A poor choice in Director and Writer. Don't blame the actors. One more thing to rant about. 1 hour and 40 minutes???????????? WHAT THE HELL?!?!?! There could have at least been 20-30 minutes of good solid detail that could have made the whole movie WAY more interesting but no. They decide to sacrifice making the movie interesting just to make it under 2 hours. I would MUCH rather sit and watch a good long movie than a short bad one.,Eragon

In LOTR they did the best they could to get all the details right and not drift away from the original story, somethings were left out thou. In Eragon, not even the most crucial moments of the storyline in the book has been covered. And they have changed the story to fit their poor budget( a fantasy film in 1h 44min COME ON!). People that have read the book shouldn't see the film, you'll just get angry. And for the people that haven't, do it, and show the film to your children, because they might like it. I hope that Christopher Paolini stops them from making ""The eldest"".The books are great, but the film should be banned.",Eragon

I wish it would be made again but only in keeping with the book. Like the Harry potter books things changed (for movie sake), but not the essence of the book. On the other hand my husband (whom hadn't read the book) thought the move was good, but still not fantastic! I was expecting Lord of the Rings good. I do hope someone is willing to take a chance, spend a lot of money and make this again. It can be as good as Lord of the Rings. time frame of buildings, all the cities the splendor of the mountain.

I was extremely disappointed.Disappointing Factors: They strayed from the original story a great dealThe editing looked like it was done by a college student running out of time to turn in a projectThey didn't do a good job at all of laying out the pros/cons from each of the racesActing was a little less than what I was expectingThere was extremely too much cheese factor in many of lines that made it embarrassingly comical in several scenesI think they blew their budget on Avril's ending credits song and rushed the rest.Wardrobe was pretty disappointing on all characters other than Brom and AryaPleasing Factors:Brom's character was played very wellDurza's character was spot onGreat flying scenesSome of the landscape was wonderfulBottom line: I felt like I had watched an extended trailer of the movie. It horribly spliced event to event. The great aspects of how much evil verses innocents/good wasn't delivered. The best they did to illustrate King Galbatorix's power and evil were cheesy one liners and a ""power ranger villain"" type hideout. Why is Katrina in the credits when her character never made it on screen? I've never critiqued a movie before but this just had too much hype and very little actually delivered.",Eragon
943,philpisch,Bad telling of a good story,3,16 December 2006,"The movie barely reflects the book. Those who read the book will be mad at the movie. Otherwise, it is just a B-grade fantasy flick.Many reviewers are saying Eragon is a Lord Of The Rings or Star Wars take off. I don't think that is true. The book is a fantasy genre that always includes elfs, middle kingdoms and such. That is the nature of the story. Also, it is a good-versus-evil story. Those stories have a hero who is learning and being mentored. The book stands on its own.My question is how does the book plot get slaughtered to produce this movie. The movie should have taken another hour at minimum. Instead this is an ulra short 104 minute movie. I think the produces were trying to maximize revenue. Anyone advocating for good story telling got ignored.",Eragon
944,glassocchocomilk,Eragon sucks!,3,16 December 2006,"The movie itself wasn't bad, but it was a complete disappointment for someone who is such a huge fan of Mr. Paolini and his writing.If you have not read the book version of Eragon, DON'T. I went after having re-read the book the night before and I almost cried. All of the most important scenes are cut out and out of order. They were supposed to smash the crystal remember? And whatever happened to the dwarfs? And wasn't Eragon supposed to be taken prisoner by Durza? It's wrong! I'm wondering if the director even READ the books, and one of the most important events of the whole series - Eragon's slash from Durza - is cut completely. The cast is all wrong, and Saphira is a dragon, not a puppy. She' not supposed to breathe fire until the end. Duh. They screwed it. Don't go see it.",Eragon
945,pinoyboy2392-1,Not a very good representation of Paolini's work,1,22 December 2006,"The only remotely spectacular thing about this movie is the scenery. The movie cuts out half of the book and the half it does tell is so badly portrayed. The acting from the beginning is so awkward to watch. The chemistry between Brom and Eragon does not develop at all, and when Brom dies, the watcher who has not read the books does not really understand how important Brom really was. The importance of Angela, the herbalist fortuneteller, Murtagh, the Ra'zac and the Varden are all underplayed drastically. As a reader of the books, the writers try to incorporate a lot while the purpose of a lot of characters are not understood. The fortune telling doesn't flow at all with the already choppy storyline. Murtagh went freely to the Varden while it was clear in the book that he was truly afraid of going there because of his being his father's son. The Ra'zac look like creepy beings of the shade's formation, while they are totally different in the book. They are portrayed as killing frenzied monsters in the movie, while they are more intelligent, more specialized assassin type beings in the books, whose origin are unknown. The Varden are much more important in the book, and the politics and habits of them are more elaborated in the book. The writers totally ignored the dwarfs, with only one mention of them in the whole movie, while they are as important as the elves, whose role was also underplayed in the movie. The dwarven city of Tronjheim looked so lacking, if the circle of ramshakle huts in the movie were the writers interpretation of Paolini's description of a glorious city reminiscent of Minas Tirith in Peter Jackson's Lord of the Rings. It is a marvelous city of different colored gems, a testament to the amazing craftsmanship of the dwarfs. Farthen Dur is also downplayed, being one of the Beor Mountains, it is supposed to be the height of maybe even higher than the Himalayas, as their tops aren't even seen from the Hadarac Desert, a portion of the book not even mentioned in the movie. This movie makes Paolini's work seem plageristic of Lucas' Star Wars and Jackson's Lord of the Rings, while the books clearly differentiate the plot as unparallel to them in plot. This is probably one of the worst book to screen movies that I have ever seen.",Eragon
946,irmah,The Worst Movie of the Year,1,16 December 2006,"I read the book twice! Even bought the audio book to share with a friend on a road trip ...All I can say is...they slaughtered what could have been the best movie of the year. Pacing of the movie was atrocious, key elements from Catrina (hello, she was the main reason Roran was in Eldest!)to Eragon's training(honestly how could we possibly believe he killed Urgal's after training with Brom for one day). Furthermore, none of Alagaesia was even explained! I did however like Ed Speelers and Jeremy Irons...But still such a pity to waste such a great book. 15 Minutes into the movie I wanted my money back...to bad I felt guilty that I took my nephews with me to watch it and endured the whole flick. I'm definitely still looking forward to book number three and will pretend this movie was just a bad boring dream.",Eragon
947,linettea,Fans of the book will be disappointed,5,16 December 2006,"While you cannot expect a movie to fully capture everything a book details, one might hope it would at least capture the essence of the book. Eragon captures stunning visuals, and special effects but not the heart of the story. If you are looking for great visuals captured on film then this movie is a WINNER. If you are looking for a Fair representation of a book then BUZZZ.. NOPE. Major parts have been modified that in essence change the story. Dwarfs seem a bit TALL, and with WETA doing some of the work one would have hoped for better. Saphira's wings have feathers? In the books they are described as thin membranes, while this might be a minor change to some it does not fit in with the visual that was expected. In my opinion the movie is worth a bargain showing but not full price!",Eragon
948,ihatchetmanrox,Uncool,2,16 December 2006,It was nothing like the book i mean they changed sooooo much it ruined the whole concept of making a movie in the first place. i mean you can see it was cheaply made you can see the reflecting of a car in the background of the beginning they cut out main characers and changed the whole damn plot.......i swear i am going to get the director.....ill get the Amish Mafia after them!!!!! if your a fan of the Eragon series please don't waste your time on this cheap rip-off of lord of the rings....there are scenes taken right out of LOTR(lord of the rings). if you really want to see it wait till it comes out on sale. seriously wait until it comes out on DVD.,Eragon
949,vulpekatherine,Much too short for justice,5,16 December 2006,"I completely agree with the posted comment about Eragon the movie. This movie's story was much too rushed. The writers must have been rushed to push out this story due to its popularity. I agree that there are similarities to Lord of the Rings and Harry Potter and Narnia for that matter. But, I think the REASON Eragon captured so many readers and passionately followed to Eldest is because it does stand on its own in plot and adventure. The characters in the book have much more depth and passion about their world than I feel the movie displayed. I think the actors were well placed, except could have used more special effects in costuming, especially the Urgals. I also was disappointed to see little Elf-like likeness to Arya as she is described in detail in the books. This was a movie my entire family had anticipated eagerly, from all of us having read the book(s)and left the cinema with no sense of fulfillment's or excitement for the next of the trilogy. PLEASE, PLEASE..take the time and the money necessary to do this story justice in the sequel(s). No, it is not L.O.T.R or Narnia, but is doesn't have to be an aged old story to enchant and invoke wonder and excitement. Harry hasn't been around all that long and those stories were certainly given justice. Shapira's voice was perfect along with her animation now if only all the detail had been like hers.",Eragon
950,lylidaoc,so very very sad i spent money on it,1,16 December 2006,"My husband and I were in shock over how much we disliked this movie.I said to him in the car on the way home that it felt like a 2 hour long trailer for the actual movie.Words can not express how disappointed we both are.1. Didn't follow the story line 2. The lack of other ""races"" or the belief that there are any 3. No character development 4. Sapphira looked pretty, but not the way she was supposed to 5. The characters aren't even where they are supposed to be by the end of the movieWill not waste my money on seeing any sequels on this.I suggest if you like the book not to see it either.",Eragon
951,meriel666,Eragon: I'm so disappointed,7,16 December 2006,"I was waiting for an incredible movie but instead they give us a horrible adaptation to the book, well its a great book and a not so bad movie but it was disappointing for all the fans, it has great effects and all but is too short!! About the actors I liked Jeremy Irons, Garrett Hedlund, Ed Speleers and Mr. Hudson the others not that much, also that Arya is an Elf, Where are her ears??? and of course there are some good things like the relationship between Eragon and Roran, and of course Saphira, she was just perfect!! I have seen the movie in English and Spanish, the voices in Spanish (latinamerican) were pretty good and they were a lot like the original ones, If someone hasn't read the book he or she would like the movie.",Eragon
952,snapple007,Eragon,1,16 December 2006,"I have read both of the books, Eragon and Eldest, twice prior to the movie release. The movie in no way hold true to the book, nor the chronology of events nor the details of how things happened in the book. If this movie were made based on a book I had written, there would not be enough words in any language to describe how irate I would be over how poor of a job was done. I would not waste my time with this movie, especially after reading the book. Saphira was great in appearance and animation. The remainder of the cast left so much to be desired.

I have never seen such a bad film(compared to the films in the last 5years), C. Paolini has soled the film rights to the first guy that came knocking on his door. In the film everything is changed, story characteristics story... It is a disgrace to the book. The reissuer remade the story Eragon (and bad isn't an appropriate expression, how he demolished the story), taking it's heart, story, meaning and tension. Every thing is turned around, its summer! Razak are Zombies and not Bird like beings. They elaborate in not necessary elements and leave out the exiting and highlights of the story (Saphira saves Eragon with the stone of the Varden)Oh, they even have the nerve, not to show the whole city of the Varden and most of the small towns and city's are just shown close up, which confuses the viewer.I was very disappointed with the film, I hope Paolini doesn't make the same mistake gain.WARNING: SAY ""YES"" TO (ILLEGALLY)DOWNLOADING ERAGON,SAY ""NO"" TO WATCHING IT IN THE THEATRES^^eronic don't really do it!",Eragon
954,profmesmus1,Nobody Cared Enough,1,17 December 2006,"I don't know how much money was poured into this film but it has a curious low budget feel to it. The camera work has a cramped ""made for TV"" flavor to it like the scenes were shot for a 27 inch screen, not for a major cinematic release. Consequently, you almost never get the sweeping spascious feel that a fantasy epic demands. The costumes and scenery contribute to the cheesiness of the film in that they seem to be leftovers from other films. There is no unified ""look"" to the film, like you might see with Ridley Scott or Peter Jackson.It merely seems cobbled together from bits and pieces of other low budget films. Everyone is almost horribly miscast. The Evil Sorcerer reminds me of Alice Cooper. Jeremy Irons would've been better off as the Evil King, and John Malkovich has too much class as an actor to be in this film at all.",Eragon
955,aldemaever,Eragon was horrible... A book/movie comparison...,1,16 December 2006,"Myself, my brother and a friend of mine went to see the debut of 'Eragon.' The sad part about it, was that I only lasted through about 30 minutes of the movie, before we walked out and demanded our money back. Before the movie was even released, I had thought Peter Jackson would've been a better fit to make the movie. My brother had told me that Christopher Paolini wanted to have a lesser known company produce his movie,and that I should give it a chance... It was a bad idea, and I'll tell you why: 1) In the book, when Saphira bonded with Eragon, and gave him the Gedwëy Ignasia, or 'shining palm' it says nothing about Brom, Arya, and Galbatorix sensing it at the same moment it happens. Nor does it say anything about Arya telling Durza that the egg has already hatched, as it does in the movie.2) In the book, it takes Saphira a good amount of time to grow into a larger dragon and to develop communication skills. It didn't happen on her first flight into the air, like the movie portrays. The ability for Eragon and Saphira to communicate was slowly established, not automatic.3) The Urgals in the movie looked like war-painted employees of the WWE. The book perceives them as having bowed legs, thick brutish arms made for crushing, very large ram-like horns with yellow, piggish eyes and grayish skin. There's nothing in the movie (from what I had seen) that resembled the Urgal description. If they were Urgals, then I should the Kull to look like the gray Incredible Hulk?4) The first time Eragon used the magic term 'brisngr,' he was in an alley in a village that had been ravaged by Urgals. In the movie, they're on a bridge in Daret, and his arrow not only kills some Urgals, but it destroys the bridge as well. That scene was ridiculous. It's like Starsky and Hutch crashing through cardboard boxes in a warehouse. It was too played out.5) Why was Brom so eager to bring Eragon to the Varden in the movie? In the book, the reason Eragon and Brom left Carvahall in the first place was to track down and kill the Ra'zac. Brom was reluctant to bring Eragon to the Varden the entire journey. Only when their opportunities for survival had depleted, did they know that the Varden was the only place they could go.6) In the book, Roran leaves Carvahall to work as a miller's assistant in Therinsford. When he comes back, the Ra'zac and Imperial soldiers come looking for him. In the movie, Roran leaves because he is of age (18) and doesn't want to be recruited. He says to Eragon before he leaves that he doesn't know where he is going.7) In the book, Brom is wise, knowledgeable story teller, but in the movie, he's a cowardly drunk guy who speaks of dragons & riders and gets looked at like he's speaking about UFOs and belongs in the madhouse. Also, if Eragon, Brom, Durza and Galbatorix are from Alagaesia, why is Galbatorix the only one without an English accent (he has an American accent)? 8) It's rumored that they spent A LOT of money making this movie. Honestly, I'm not sure on what. Possibly on Saphira. Oh, and just by watching the movie, it's never said how she obtains her name. And where does feathers on a dragon come in? Is it a birdon, or a dragird? No. It states in the book that Saphira's wings are made of a 'thin membrane.' In one scene, of the movie, Eragon snaps at Brom saying ""I'll never ride her again!"" In the book, he is so severely cut and bleeding from her scales rubbing against his legs, that he passes out for a couple of days. That's why he said he'd never ride her again. Of course, you wouldn't know that from the movie.9) Durza looked like Paul Reubens (Pee-Wee Herman for those who have forgotten), and reminded me more of a pedophile than a villain. Why was John Malkovich playing King Galbatorix? I could've sworn I was watching John Lithgow in a leotard. John Malkovich seemed like he was overacting to me. Why wasn't Solembum the werecat, Orik, or the Twins in the movie? They existed in the book... Oh, wait. That's right. From the way the movie portrayed things, probably 50 of the 544 pages were used to write this seedy plot, and later, filmed disappointment.The bottom line is that it felt like chapters were skipped, and key events were missed or altered for something far less appealing then what was in the book. I wish I could've had the 30 minutes back I spent watching this bleeding Picasso. I actually enjoyed the 5 minute trailer of Eddie Murphy's ""Norbit"" more than I enjoyed watching Eragon. The books are incredible, and I couldn't put down Eragon or Eldest. The movie on the other hand, I don't think I can finish watching it.Not So Safe Bet: See the movie... Safe Bet: See the movie, then read the book... Safest Bet: Read the book, and don't watch the movie.",Eragon
956,ushiyasha,-_- so horrible,1,16 December 2006,"the book was so awesome and epic, i would recommend never seeing the movie but definitely reading the book....I'm am utterly disgusted with how they managed to gut a great book and make it into a horrible movie. there was a lot of detail in the book and so many things were taken out or mixed around in the end it will leave all the people who read the book heart broken. saphira's wings were saposed to be more like bat wings with the whole membrane thing going on and the were cat from the book wasn't even mentioned. a whole epic journey and lots of hardship and weeks of travel leaving it looking like the movie happened in days not months like in the book and not a single mention of the dwarfs! ..so sad....i have never been left so upset by a movie... i don't plan to buy it and i don't see how the next one can be made with the plot being so badly mangled....don't see it not worth it but please READ IT! despite the movie the book is great and i hope people arn't discouraged by the movie...it would be a shame to judge the book by its movie",Eragon

For anyone else you might as well already pen a note to the manager of the theater asking for your money back.I have really enjoyed the Eragon and Eldest books, and looked forward to seeing the first movie today....it is a complete and utter abomination. There is just the slimmest following of the books, and even that done very poorly. Don't even rent it when it comes out on DVD. You might wish to wait a couple of years when it is on TV and feel free to interrupt yourself if there is an exciting game of Curling...It really, really is THAT bad.",Eragon
958,coolchater123435,A good story but a bad film,1,16 December 2006,"Let's see..... the movie sucks. I am one of the people who read the book and the movie is almost completely different. For example Saphira she grew in a couple of months not in a second and she didn't knew her name till Eragon went to Bron and asked him a couple a of names. Some characters are missing(the blacksmith, the butcher's daughter, two dwarfs and so on)that are crucial for the next part. Brom was killed by an ""ra'zac"" not by Durza. The city was underground and they didn't said that is was the greatest of the dwarfs. Aria was half dead when Eragon found her and she didn't told him anything about her on top of this she nearly killed her when he entered her mind, in the movie Aria knew everything about him. My biggest problem was that they made Saphira with feathers!!?? Dragons don't have feathers.Many other mistakes are in the film but I won't reveal all of them.If you want to enjoy a good story read the book, Paolini did an amazing thing witch is ruined by a bad ""regizor""p.s. excuse my English and that I mixed all the ideas",Eragon
959,yamayabybay,What were they thinking?!,1,16 December 2006,"This was thoroughly disappointing excuse for a movie! I was expecting SO much more than that, even though I know no movie can include every detail perfectly from such an amazing novel! The only reason I had any interest in seeing the movie was because of how fascinating and creative the book was. The movie incorporated names and the general setting of the nook, but changed the order of events and left out so many important characters, places, and details that the story no longer seemed related to the book in any way! Overall, the graphics were the only thing I enjoyed. This was a pathetic example of someone trying to make a book into a movie and they shouldn't have bothered if they were going to change everything to the point of nonrecognition! I have no idea how anyone could have enjoyed this movie, with or without reading the written masterpiece.",Eragon

Also how much story was cut, and Eragon vs Durza should have been longer with sword to sword combat on the ground and ending like it did in the book. over all it's a wonderful cuss free movie :D.",Eragon

962,dennislmccord,eragon,1,16 December 2006,"it is obvious the director lacks the ability to read. this movie was pathetic all the director did by taking the ideology of the story line and changing it was discrediting Christopher paolini writing. the books are great don't get me wrong i feircely enjoyed them. the commentary at the start of the movie assumes that the viewers have read the books, if you have read the books, don't spend your money on this load of crap of a film. the dragon in the movie was OK the special effects were,well dragon slayer had better effects and thats an 80's movie. in short the writer Christopher paolini is great. the director needs to be fired and Chris get peter Jackson to direct the next series you write. i hope this clown the directed this pile does not ruin your upcoming books..",Eragon
963,zidane-16,Eragon wrecks on first flight.,2,16 December 2006,"Okay, now we all know the book is absolutely amazing, and which was why 6 of my friends and I went to see Eragon the movie the night it came out. We were VERY disappointing. Overall, they skipped probably...what?...over 100 chapters? The battle scene was too short, not enough gore, and hardly any fighting. They left out too much, WAY too much. Believe me, save your money, see something else, because you can picture what's going on a lot better by reading the book, rather than going to see the movie. Another thing, what happened to the twins at Furthen Dur? They played a huge role, and where was Katrina? Anyhow, the movie pretty much went like this: start at chapter 1, skip about 10, then about 15 more...hm..that looks good, lets skip 20 more, okay, now 10 again, and oh look!...were at the end!..oh my, that was quick. Yah, good job directors. Lastly, I have two words that would have made this film the best of the year and probably would have won it a lot of awards: Peter Jackson. We all know he did Lord of the Rings, and if Eragon would have been directed by him, it would have been a lot better, it should have also been 3 hours long, for it would have taken it that much to cover book. That's it, can't wait to see the Eldest movie (kidding).",Eragon

If I had been hired as the director and was told to mess it up as much as i could i still think the real director would have me beaten. I think they must've told Christopher Paoloni that they couldn't let him see it because they wanted to surprise him, boy did he get a surprise. He was probably crying by the time the movie was over. They should just recall the movie and make a new and better one. i don't recommend anyone who has read the book to watch it, it will probably make you sick.",Eragon
966,samurix7,What the hell went wrong?!,1,16 December 2006,"WOW!!! how bad can you recreate a book to film? This is by far the worst adaptation of a book i have ever seen! They cut a bunch out and sped right through the film. There was in no way could you get a 500 page book and make it into a 104 minute film. Here are just a few of my annoyances.Galbatorix was never even described in the book, but we see him so many times in the movie. Whos acting was terrible by the wayRoran doesn't go to the military, he goes to work as a miller in Therinsford so he and Katrina (who somehow disappeared) would live happily.Where were the traders?where was Horst when there was conflict with Sloan. Why were the Razac half eaten zombies? they wore cloaks and had beaks. Saphira hatches under Eragon's bed not in the barn.Eragon has to figure out a name for Saphira, she's not supposed to tell him. oh and she magically grew up in an instant.Oh and Saphira's scene of going crazy, Eragon couldn't talk to her and they ended up in the spine! They spent the night there in the SNOW!! The snow wasn't even there!OK now we go to Brom and Eragon riding off. OMFG CAMERA FLARES!! NOO!!!! now they go to Durat or what ever its called. wait what happened to Therinsford where Roran was going to work as a miller? o thats right Roran went to the military! So at Durat they meet Angela...ANGELA!! WHAT!! she is supposed to be at Tierm next door to Jeob (who also fails to exist in the movie) and is supposed to be a herbalist not some golden fortune teller, even though she did do that in the book.Now Urgals attack. apparently they attacked in Therinsford where Roran was going to, but who cares (sarcasm). so Eragon learns Brisingr and shoots an Urgal (who are supposed to be demon like not human) and the arrow explodes. apparently in the book the arrow hit the Urgal and exploded on his shoulder causing the body to blow up in a million pieces but its PG what can you do. it really should have been PG-13. O and it wasn't on any bridge but in an alley way fighting off only two Urgals.Then Eragon travels again and trains ONCE! thats it. No numerous sparring no magic training, just one training.Then is forcibly shown Arya, not by accidental Scrying (still not mentioned). Still the they travel to Gilread to save Arya when they are attacked by the razac. Eragon is near death when he used magic and hangs on of them and Brom kills the other one. WOAH!! THEY KILLED THEM!! BIG NO NO!! apparently this was where we were supposed to meet Murtagh and Brom dies. but no.They reach Gilread and Eragon goes in and saves Arya and hurts the shade but Brom is killed by a spear from the shade. Before I continue might I add that Eragon was imprisoned here by the Urgals, rescued by Murtagh and then rescues Arya who is unconscious. Oh and Brom would have died a long time ago.So now Brom is dying and Eragon tries to heal him but is not strong enough. even though the elf who can transport an egg half across the world can't do any magic because for some reason she won't. Ayra is conscious through all this, but then falls ill and Murtagh shows them the way to the Varden (he hates the Varden in the book). They begin to go to the Varden through mountain..wait mountains? Where was the desert? So they get to the valley and are suddenly followed by Urgals and no cool scene with the dwarfs saving them. Actually i didn't see any dwarfs, nor did i see the Twins or Orlik.Eragon didn't seem to go to the rider's room in the movie and no explanation of the dwarven city. they just get right into battle.Murtagh is in a poor mans cell when he actually likes his prison. oh and we never hear Murtagh's story. Shade vs Eragon...dragon vs..weird black smoke thing. wow that never happened. it was much cooler in the book and Eragon never got his scar and Saphira was never close to death. Where was the mystery voice that spoke to Eragon?

967,felipeemoyano,Elves dwarfs and men what's the difference?,2,16 December 2006,"I just arrived from the movie theater and I found myself saying not again the ""Dungeons and dragons"" effect there are no real difference between the races, where were arya's ears???? but this just the beginning of the cataclysm all the surprises but one where told in the introduction of the movie.Paolini's book is a fantasy tale not a kids tale I'm very disappointed with this since I am fan of epic fantasy and is very frustrating that every time somebody talks about epic fantasy, always someone said a kids tale, in this case all the perfection in alaghesia's story were lost in a ""disney's tale"" all the background was send it to thrash and create a new one more childish.OK Saphira the dragon is the only one thing of this movie that really worth it except for one thing why the feathers? no dragon had feathers hey but after all it is only my opinion",Eragon
968,lcwilkinson,Eragon - not worth seeing,1,16 December 2006,"I was EXTREMELY disappointed with this movie. It could have been done SO well! Instead it has NO depth at all. Things are changed so much it was hardly recognizable. If I hadn't known what the story line was supposed to be, I would have become very confused. Very, very bad. I had been looking forward to this movie for months and months. If you haven't seen it yet, don't bother. Keep the memories of the book. They are MUCH better! The Eragon character was good. Jeremy Irons did a good job also. It was just such a shallow film. I wanted to walk out due to boredom. I had hoped it would be the quality of the Lord of the Rings. With as much matter that was in the book, they could have made 2 movies out of it - part 1 and part 2. That would have been much better. They could have gone into much more depth and stuck to the real story line.",Eragon
969,do-u-haz,"one boy, one dragon, one crappy movie!",1,16 December 2006,"my summary says it all. even if you haven't read the book, it sucked. i believe two people got together and were psyched about the idea of making a movie about a dragon, and they REALLY wanted to have a scene where 2 dragons fight. but then they say, ""what do we do before and after the dragon battle?"" and couldn't think of anything so they just used filler. the movie moved super fast and you never got to know any of the characters. the movie ended abruptly with a line that left you moaning because they even contemplated making a second one.one boy...one dragon...one crappy movie",Eragon
970,ltdiablo75,Awful simply awful,1,16 December 2006,"This movie was down right awful, the way they condense and skip the entire middle part of the book cuts out entirely important sections of the book. Friends of mine who had not even read the book agreed that the condensing of the movie was very bad choice in movie making. One minute Eragon is being told he cannot take on the enemy for he is not strong enough, and the next he is using different magic spells from out of no where and can sword fight like none other. All in all the movie did the book no justice and did the movie making business no justice as well. Other points in the movie were things like the setting were incorrect for example when Brohm dies in the book they are near the Varden and he is killed by the Urgals not by Durza. As for his grave, it was made inside a cave not on a hill top. As for the acting itself, the relationship between Arya and Eragon is completely off as well. In the book she is indifferent towards him because she is far more wise and older than him, in the movie it's more a love story between the two.",Eragon
971,cutebluetruck,What were they thinking?,1,16 December 2006,"What was the writer thinking when he wrote the screenplay? The actual author of the book writes an amazing tale. Honestly one of the best science fiction works I've read, ever. The movie was nothing like the book at all. The computer animation was awesome. That's the one and only thing I have to say that's positive. The plot did barely resemble the book (which was a work of art). So much was left out that I don't think a sequel is possible, and definitely not advisable unless a new writer is found for that screenplay. The camera angles and music and animation were good, but the plot pure rubbish. How could they destroy such a great book!? My apologies to the author of the actual book that the screenplay destroyed any plot and or depth of the story. It was like pissing on the Mona Lisa. Thank you and good night.",Eragon
972,blood-lord,Travesty,1,16 December 2006,"The Defintion of the word Travesty is: A work that treats a serious subject frivolously-- ridiculing the dignified.Which is exactly what this movie is for anyone who is a fan of the book(s) that it purportedly based on. If you are like me you want to see a movie that celebrates the first of a series of books that I have enjoyed greatly. Instead I left the theater feeling like I had been slapped in the face.Entire characters are written out. Vital character development is ignored. Stupid scenes that defy reason are used to cut out large portions of the story. Characters appear in scenes where they cannot logically be. Jarring mistakes are made where props change dramatically from one scene to the next. And the story is changed in some places for no apparent reason.I could go on a tirade saying things like, ""I doubt the book was even used to make the movie"" or ""its just the usual Hollywood sellout gloss-over"". But the fact is that wont change anything. The damage has been done. The only thing that I can do is hopefully warn others before they view it.",Eragon
973,idproductions,I am shocked and sick.,2,16 December 2006,I feel so sorry for the author. The book was very enjoyable and I was very excited to see this movie. The movie took a great story and turned it into the biggest piece crap I have ever seen. It felt like it was directed by a high school student and the story did not follow the book at all. It was the biggest waste of my money in years and I should get my money back. What a load of crap. Edward Speleers is hot but a bad actor. Not right for the role. The story was predictable and nothing like the book. Galbatorix should not have been in the movie at all. It took away all of his characters mystery. The special effects where the only thing that kept me from giving this movie a big fat ZERO out of 10. Don't pay to see this movie. Buy the book. You will be glad you did. If you see this movie after reading the book you will see just how bad it really is.,Eragon
974,pikaman2000,Do NOT watch this movie,2,16 December 2006,"I read the books, and i thought they were incredible, especially considering the inexperience of the author. The movie falls to the other end of the spectrum. You need to know the books to even make sense of the movie - the person who accompanied me spent the entire car ride to her house asking me what happened. Not only that, but it is a forced movie - everything happens too quickly. The only good thing was the four good performances, done my John Malkovich, Jeremy Irons, Eragon (cant remember his name) and Rachel weisz. They had sound performances, even though the screen writer should be torn limb from limb. ANother thing is how utterly cliché it was. They tried to make it a little heartfelt near the conclusion, but failed utterly. If you want to waste time and money, then go ahead and see this movie. If you want to be entertained, then watch the reactions of those walking out of the theater.",Eragon
975,exaltado,I am EXTREMELY disappointed with this movie!!,1,17 December 2006,"I can't believe all of the horrible changes they made to this movie. In my opinion the makers of this movie have completely ruined the entire story-line. I realize that they needed to cut out a lot of the story to be able to fit it all into one movie, but Brom didn't even die the way he was supposed to, Murtagh didn't get kidnapped at the end, Arya went to Ellesmera alone and she didn't even have elf-ears for Christ's sake!! How many elves would decide to go 'incognito' as human? I really hope they don't decide to do any more movies from this trilogy. Just leave this story-line alone so that fans can remember it fondly.I would say that maybe with the next movie, they could try and go back to the original story-line, but I don't think they can even fix how horribly they have messed this up.",Eragon
976,morpethfairies,it's not that bad,8,17 December 2006,"as far as this ones concerned it is hard to clearly see the way in the beginning. however once it gets going Eragon becomes an entertaining movie. yes i know for the purists it has not followed the book too closely but considering some of the movies coming out at the moment this is a welcome breeze of fantasy & imagination. do yourself a favor see this movie with an open mind & leave all comparisons to the lord of the rings trilogy at home.you will enjoy it. acting wise it's a little thin but this movie never pretends that it is a contender. remember things can only get better. at least it is a solid start to build on for ""eldest""",Eragon
977,lilla_alv,Don't pay to see it,2,17 December 2006,"I finished the book this summer and when I read about a coming movie I began to count the days. How wrong I was.This movie is a disaster and I'm pretty sure that the one who made it hasn't read the same book as I. The book they have made the film of is one with maximum five pages and a lot of pretty pictures.After fifteen minutes they had jumped a lot of the story from the book and I feel like the movie wouldn't seem reasonable if I hadn't read it before. The characters are boring except from Robert Carlyle as Durza who in my opinion makes the movie watchable. John Malkowitch plays the same old way he Always do and no one of the others actors make me want to see what happens next. Everything that happens in it feels rushed and hasty. A LOT from the book has been removed (WHERE are Aryas EARS?! She is an elf for God's sake!) and the long bonding between Saphira and Eragon that I think is the center of the story is nowhere to be seen.I must agree to what others have written here, the movie oozes from Peter Jackson-wannabe syndrome.

978,archangel2040,Worst attempt at bringing a book to movie format,1,21 February 2009,"I had noticed a lot of children that I worked with reading this book and borrowed a copy, and loved the way Paolini created a character anybody can sympathize with and believe, and when I heard they had made it into a movie I couldn't wait to see it.I don't think the people who made this movie ever bothered to pick up a copy of the book because they changed all kinds of things for no reason. They had characters dying at the wrong parts, not to mention killing off other characters that are still around in the third book! They had motivations for characters that made absolutely no sense, such as his cousin was never being threatened to join the kings army, and their soldiers weren't wandering around their camp. Now I am the first person to make fun of people for saying it isn't like the book, comic book etc. But Paolini wrote an excellent story and it needed no changes to it at all! I think they did so terribly bad that I would agree they could remake this movie and people would gladly forget that it ever existed to begin with.The only good parts of this movie were John Malkovich and Rachel Weisz Do not waste your time watching this if you have read the book",Eragon

I went to see this with family two of us have read the book one is reading it and the last not read it. We all agree a terrible film. The person who has not read it is confused and it doesn't make since. The film is disjointed, the storyline is butchered beyond what could be considered reasonable especaily since it now will make a large part of the 2nd book unuseable due to key story points. And lastly stop whiting your teeth holiywood it's disturbing and unnatural to have glow in the dark teeth.I pleased with you go and read the book as it is a very good story.. The film however should be locked in a box and sent into the sun.",Eragon
980,Emma-Simpson,"Very good but missing people, places and a big plot line.",6,17 December 2006,"Well here's what I think. After reading both Eragon and Eldest I was waiting in quietly in a small bubble of excitement until it came out. The movie itself was very good, it had all the right amount of CG and acting however the fact that so many characters were taken out and others put in different places annoyed me. Half of the book was taken away and everything was rushed. None of they characters really progressed through the story and you only hear 5 pieces of The Ancient Language (Elven Language). There isn't enough time to put the whole story into a short space but all the same there should have been more history about the Riders.But if you haven't read the book I think you will enjoy the fact that so it is an amazing storyline and is full of drama and brilliance. I strongly advice you read the books. They are amazing and moving, they can change your life.",Eragon
981,brynndublin,"Read the book, skip the film",2,17 December 2006,"I almost walked out of this, it was so bad. Lighting throughout was so dark it was impossible to make out action. Dialog was stilted and badly delivered. The costumes in the beginning were pretty cool, but as the movie progressed to amour and a more formal look, they became embarrassingly horrible. Jeremy Irons made the best of a bad role. And Edward Speleers has promise. The other actors? Judging by their performances here, uniformly terrible. I know you have to change details of a book to adapt it to film, but I'm baffled as to why they made the omissions and changes they did. Christopher Paolini's book deserved better.",Eragon
982,highlordtalon,Such a sad waste of a great book!,1,17 December 2006,"Wow. I cannot believe how HORRIBLE this movie is! I just now saw this, after having just finished both the Eragon and Eldest books.If you saw the movie, and liked it... or even better, didn't like it, Read the books! The movie only barely follows the book's storyline. It had dragons, a king, and a few key people. Beyond that, they are nothing alike. There are no soldiers in the town in the book, they are not forcing people to join the army. Brom is not an ass, or a Rider ashamed of his past. He's a great hero! One who has the respect of many. I won't spoil what's in the book, but he was not in Eragon's town to hide from his past. What a joke.Second, where are the ELVES? My god, Arya is supposed to be an elf! And there are supposed to be dwarfs in the mountain hideout for the Varden. They didn't have the giant stone that Arya broke, in fact... Arya sure doesn't look like an elf.People have probably analyzed this pretty in depth, so I don't go on about it...All I can say is that the books are GREAT, and the movie did NOT follow the books at all. The movie is a joke, and is a horrible one at that.",Eragon
983,sarahhannah-1,At least the dragon was cool,4,17 December 2006,"Very upsetting. I'd been looking forward to this movie for months, especially since there's yet to be a good film for dragons. While I understand the need to cut the story down to fit it into two hours, I'm curious as to how they will tie many of the pieces together to make the second one (Giliad, the twins, etc)...assuming there IS a second movie. I really hope so and I hope that Paolini learns from the this one (how awful it is) and tries to stay more true to the story.On a positive note, most of the actors did well with what they were given and I look forward to seeing them again with better material. Malcovich as Galbortix was probably the worst of all characters. Maybe it was just the script, I usually enjoy his work. I enjoyed Ed Speelers and Jeremy Irons but definitely think Brom should've been in the film longer.I think the end was most upsetting because it wasn't true to the book in any way. From the poor introduction of the Varden to the actual ending, it just didn't work. With all the work put into this film, an extra 30 minutes would've helped it tremendously. As mentioned, some of the important details were missing and additional time would've allowed for more depth.",Eragon
984,livetoread_ak,You people need a reality check...,10,17 December 2006,"Just because there were a few things changed in the movie doesn't mean it wasn't good!! This is my philosophy: Any writer can make their story as long or short as they want. But movies have a limit. It just so happens that Eragon(the book) was really long because thats how Paolini wanted it. The movie HAD to be changed. It was essential. The movie was the best I have EVER seen because I chose to broad on the changes and outtakes for only a few seconds. I suggest anybody who hates the movie, GIVE IT ANOTHER CHANCE! I have seen it twice now and it got better the second time i saw it. It makes me sad that i was among the very few who applauded the movie( one being my brother who never applaudes to movies, he thinks its weird, yet he did for Eragon) Don't be such bad critics to a remarkable movie. NOBODY likes bad critics. To see a truly ruined book-turned-movie, read Ella Enchanted then see the movie. THAT was terrible.",Eragon
985,eosofthedawn1,A fun movie to watch.,10,17 December 2006,This was just a excellent movie to watch. With all the kids movies out at this time a year this is a movie that was just a great escape from the other junk that is out there. It does go against the book at times but no movie stays true to the books anyway. If you want a fun movie to watch this is it. Saphira looks wonderful. She is very life like. Jeremt Irons does a lovely turn as Brom. The casting of Arya is what I am most upset about. I wish they would of stayed closer to the book description on her. Murtagh was exactly how I pictured him in the book. Mr. Hedlund did a very good job with him. Durza was fantastic. Every bit as scary as in the book. Do yourself a favor and see this movie.,Eragon
986,joaquintheperfect,Mediocre at Best,1,17 December 2006,"After wonderful movie representations of the Lord of the Rings and Harry Potter, I at least expected a decent version of Eragon. Not only were key events were left out, IE...visiting Teirm...crossing the desert, bet some were completely changed! The final battle with Durza was drastically changed, Arya's character was far to sociable, and the dwarfs looked like every one else. Soldiers are not supposed to be in Carvahall, Brom is killed by the the wrong people, and Brom's history is not explained until he is about to die. Key characters were also left out, the Twins, Orik, Solembaum the Werecat. Angela was neither quirky nor important in the movie, Ajihad is supposed to die, Murtagh is supposed to disappear, Galbatorix isn't supposed to be shown, and Arya sticks around with Eragon for a while, and the Urgals don't have horns. All and all the CGI was very impressive, but it wasn't enough to cover up the atrocious screenplay. Even though a 15 year old wrote the book, that does not mean the movie should be directed, wrote, and produced by teenagers.",Eragon
987,jdaedelus,Eragon..sounds almost like Aragorn,1,17 December 2006,"I have never seen a movie that so deliberately stole ideas and concepts from Lord of The Rings, even lines. It also manages to pilfer concepts from,Harry Potter, and complete scenes from Star Wars as well. Indeed during the movie I often wonder when an Ewok would jump out to help overthrow the Emperor ""Derza"". The director of this movie should have been shot on site. The screen play writer should be impaled for his terrible writing. The teenager who wrote the book should be tarred, feathered, and run out of town.It's hard to blame actors, for a bad script, bad editing, and out theft of ideas.",Eragon

Scenes were choppy, clipped, poorly written and definitely under developed. The story line was difficult to follow due to under developed characters the shortness of the individual scenes. More time was needed to make the movie flow on screen. The adaption should have probably produced a longer movie in order to make a contiguous story line. Main character was weak and definitely ill cast. Someone with more acting experience should have been cast in the leading role. Direction was lacking and the strength of many characters lines just simply was not there. Other characters were never put into the movie and only slightly mentioned in passing. After all the hype for this movie I was disappointed with the film and probably wouldn't want to see a second episode from this series.",Eragon

There has been a lot of people who have tried to make rip-off's of Star Wars and Lord of the Rings, but I've never seen someone try and do it at the same time! This movie really takes the cake.The villain's of this movie seemed like someone swallowed a bunch of 1950's comics and puked it up everywhere. Despite all of this the movie does have it's bright spots. Newcomer Edward Speelers did a decent job and Jeremy Irons was wonderful! But the best one was Rachel Weisz, even if it was just her voice.

I enjoyed the movie, no one left early, people leaving were talking about how much they enjoyed the movie, and not one person was ranting or raving or in anyway vocalizing negativity toward any aspect of the movie. Perhaps some people need to find something to do with their time that might lesson their negativity levels. Anyone this unhappy over something as simple as a movie meant to entertain must need some meaning added to their lives. Get over yourselves. Do you have jobs?

991,sund0260,"Expect more, get less",3,17 December 2006,"OK, I, like everyone else who has read the Eragon books thus far and thought they were great, looked at this movie coming up as something to praised at as to rival The Lord of the Rings movies. Alas we were greatly disappointed.First off, I don't think the storyline could have been butchered more than it was in this movie and have people recognize it as being based on the book. I understand that certain things cannot be put into a movie because of lack of time, funds, or other things, but at least stay true to the story in what you do put in there.The beginning moves WAY too quickly. There could have easily been another 15 minutes added to the beginning that would make those who have not read the book understand what is going on. One minute I see Eragon finding the egg in the forest in a low-key arrival (there was supposed to be a huge almost crater from the egg appearing) and the next thing I know the egg has hatched, and 20 seconds later Saphira is a full grown dragon. What is up with that? I could go on and on about what was shown in the movie that never happened in the book. Brom never set fire to Eragon's uncle's farm, it was the Ra'Zac. Eragon was not supposed to meet Angela in Daret, what ever happened to Teirim? How in the next movie will they ever be able to tie in Jeod's huge role in the books? Oh let me guess, THEY AREN'T!! Since when was Arya awake and conscious when Eragon went to rescue her? Since when was it Durza who killed Brom? Since when did Farthen Dur have trees and plant life in it? Since when was it Saphira who was greatly wounded by Durza in the final battle? How are they going to tie in Eragon's wound he is supposed to have? I saw him get hit but it did not seem to harm him that much. There are so many things butchered by this movie it is not even funny.The next movie NEEDS to get back to the story in what it is. If not it is doomed to another failure, which is what I think this movie is. The only thing it has going for it were the special effects of the dragon really. Number one they need to get a director in the seat who has a vision of what the movie is supposed to be like. Lord of the Rings could not fit everything that was in the stories into the movies, but my god they did not hack everything up into pieces and throw it all onto film and hope it would be good.In my honest opinion, Christopher Paolini should be doing what J.K. Rowling did with Harry Potter and make sure that the movie stay as true to the book as it can. Even if Eldest comes to the screen, I do not think I would ever go see it unless they stuck to the stories. A+++ for Paolini's novel, F--- for this movie of it.",Eragon

You'll be dumbfounded by how badly the movie takes a semi-decent storyline and turns it into a steaming pile of dragon crap.The lines seem as though they were written by a 6 year old, the actors obviously hate their parts, and the directors and producers must have been on crack to think this would pass as a good movie.The author of the book needs to file a lawsuit to get back the rights for the next two movies, if he sold them along with this one.

993,Libby_Pup,An overall good attempt at a recreation of the amazing book.,6,17 December 2006,"I wouldn't use harsh words when describing this movie. I personally thought it was a good attempt to recreate the book, but you only have so much money, and so much time do do so. The choice of actors seemed quite random, frankly, as they did not fit the character description. I found myself disappointed after having read both the first and second novels, then seeing this sad attempt to recreate each character. Eragon was supposed to have dark hair, and here he is a blue-eyed blonde! The only good actor in the whole of the movie was Garrett Hedlund, who played Murtagh. Not only did he fit into the persona of Murtagh, but his acting was incredible. He had recently done Troy and Four Brothers, two movies in which he did an amazing job as well, and his great acting has been the only thing that saved this movie from a horrible rating. I enjoyed watching it, and people who have not read the book will be enthralled by it, but those who have will be greatly disheartened by it. Moving on to the actors, I feel like Edward Speleers, who played Eragon, was greatly diminished by Garrett Hedlund's performance. Despite this, I still would keep Garrett in his previous role, as Eragon did do a good job being stupid. His character, Eragon, did some daft things, though I won't say what, and Murtagh just seemed more intelligent, and even more attractive than Eragon. My friends and I found ourselves entranced by Garrett Hedlund. Way to go.",Eragon

995,LMacSmith,Eragon the movie is the embodiment of the book,10,17 December 2006,"As a die-hard fantasy buff I have both Eragon and Eldest on my bookshelf along with authors such as J.V. Jones, Raymond Feist, George R.R. Martin, etc. I don't own what I don't love. And I plan to own Eragon the movie. Is Eragon the book the best fantasy I ever read? No. But it is most definitely not the worst. Is Eragon the movie the best fantasy I've ever watched? Let's just say I'm much more in tune with Eragon than Harry Potter. My newspaper career of 13 years included reviews of books and movies, and I have a well-received website. I couldn't believe my eyes when I read some of the comments and reviews about Eragon, and even heard a negative one at the theater. Am I missing something here? It isn't often one can live the adventure twice - both in print and on film -- but Eragon beat Calgon hands down for ""taking me away."" Eragon the movie is the embodiment of Eragon the book. I didn't just see actors here, I saw characters stepping out of the pages and onto the screen. Every scene was a Rembrandt of special effects, and the locations were breath-taking. The mountain region known as the Spine, which figured so prominently in the early part of the book, was instantly recognizable because of the aerial view of the riders making their way up. Many scenes were reminiscent of the very best of the fantasy genre book covers. And nowhere on any form of earth will you find a dragon more real and expressive than this movie's Saphira. Books and movies alike have their limitations, their strengths and weaknesses. A book can give us plots and subplots and hie off on rabbit trails; it has leeway to delve into multiple character relationships; it can follow characters across a continent and allow us, the readers, to sit at the campfires, join in the camaraderie, and suffer their deprivations from the comfort of our Lazyboys and central heat and air while snacking on Hershey's chocolates. A movie can do these things, too, but must limit them, else we would sit through 12 hours of movie instead of two. A movie can give us astounding visual effects. Eragon the movie did just that, awesomely. A movie can allow us to see our heroes and villains ""in the flesh"". Eragon the movie did just that, with each and every character better than I even imagined.To compress a full novel, taking hours and hours to read, into a two-hour movie, is a monumental task of sheer editing. My hat is off to the script writer. Of course scenes had to be cut and tweaked. Of course some relationships had to go. Of course it couldn't go sniffing after every plot trail. But that doesn't mean it was ""butchered"" as I heard one theater-goer comment on the way out. Every book brought to the movie screen has had to suffer these things. However, Eragon the movie is based on the solid foundation of the book; the framework is straight and true, and every scene and path and look and word is recognizable. Best of all, the movie retains and reflects the heart of the story. No, Eragon the book isn't Shakespeare and the movie isn't up there with the top 100 of all time. But I was entertained and enthralled while sitting in a darkened theater immersed in a world filled with high adventure, a world (a lovely fantasy) where the word ""noble"" actually means something and true loyalty doesn't have a price tag.

I Will Never See Another movie from this director!,1,17 December 2006,"First of all this movie was hyped up by Fox, and because I watch a lot of House I immediately assumed,since the book was a sheer emotional masterpiece, that the movie would be rival Peter Jackson's King Kong or the matrix trilogy...Not the case. Whoever says this movie is great has no taste and should not have brought the average rating of this movie up to a 5.1. There is some nice cg animation, but the plot is not followble. There is no sense of epic sense. There is no sense of time. THere is no Algeasia.This director, curse you Stefan Fergl-something, must sat down and said now how can I come up with a way to crush millions of dreams at once. He should go to jail for what he did. He took a masterpiece of a prewritten script, called a book, and said screw it I don't wanna read it!. I'll just improv.The List of things wrong.Eragon gets up in the middle of the night for seemingly no reason to hunt. Eragon gets the egg and its shape like a pill not round (which doesn't bother me). The next day Roran leaves and we don't even know him,"" yeah I got to go because I don't want to go into the army, bye"". ""Ok have a nice life"". It doesn't show Saphira being taken care of, She grows triple her size by just flying all of a sudden. See how Eragon doesn't do !!@#. Anyway, Next day the Razak come and kill his uncle. Just skip the most emotionally intense part of the book as Eragon kills his legs flying back to save his beloved uncle. Then his dragon carries him almost all the way back, because she little and can't do much. THen he struggle struggle for a mile carrying his body, its too late. No in the movie Brom comes in, ""yeah son I think we're gonna have to leave him we don't have time."" "" I need to bury him"". ""Yeah I got your funeral right here"" and burns him. And Eragon just goes off. Few scenes later and Eragon for the only time challenges Brom, fighting with a stick. He says he's trained with his cousin. All I could think was ""When?!"" The journey seemed to take a few days, not Fortnights and months. the Ogres are suppose to be bigger. Eragon was weak and couldn't do anything to them in the book with his arrows, so he said brsnger and killed one, it didn't explode ( again I could have lived with that). Eragon trained every night with Brom. He met the prophet in the a huge city surrounded by walls, with defenses everywhere near the sea. THis place is crucial to the next book. Arya didn't look like an elf. Actually none of the creatures were well represented, especially the dwarfs. Did I mention the Razac were supposed to be bird like. Eragon never found out till Brom was almost dead, that he was a rider. They never mentioned the magicians. They never mentioned Eragon honing his magic with the rock. The Thrysta episode.MY FAVORITE PART: Murtagh literally falls out of the sky ( I couldn't help but to laugh, felt like I was watchin Scary Movie 5Then they get to the Beor Mountains. They were described as huge. So huge to Eragon that he was in disbelief, from from fortnights away they looked like they must be hills at first only a few yards away, so Eragon was in disbelief as the sheer size of these peaks. You might compare them to the original size of the Appalachian mountain. I really wanted to see the mountains in this movie, but they were utterly disappointing. Then this army is at there hills with no prelude. I forgot Broms pathetic death, but you readers will have to see it for yourself because it is unspeakable, there was no desert. Like I said They get inside the cave. The city inside the mountain is suppose to be incredible. Huge even. It's the inside of a volcano three times the Himilayas or something with a hole at the top for a few rays of sun. Jewels as big as your fist were in the tunnels. Eragon was welcomed with almost a parade. It did not mention him putting a curse on the child ( again crucial to the sequeal).They out the funniest part when the dragon gets drunk. THEN THE LAST BATTLE. The Book had Sapphira crashing through A giant diamond on the roof, with Arya on her back, and shooting fire for the first time as Eragon out matched caught Durza by surprised and finished him. THe movie was something like Durza conjuring a giant bat ( I just remember it didn't show how strong Arya was too.) All and all they condensed a 500 page book down to an hour thirty. He took Paolini's masterpiece and made it a bedtime story. Sorry Paolini, but you sold out.Now it time for Peter Jackson to do his remake...",Eragon
997,musicmaster94,Save 8 bucks!,3,17 December 2006,"""Eragon"" strayed way too far from the book. The movie was too short to develop all the characters. Just when you've started to get to know Brom, he dies! And not the way he dies in the book, either. Murtagh was hardly in it, and Ajihad only had about three lines. The only good acting in this film was from Jeremy Irons and Rachel Weisz, and she only voiced Saphira! Overall, maybe worth a rental when it comes out on DVD, but only to compare it to the book. I would be surprised if Christopher Paolini, the author of the book, was thrilled about this movie. Not enough of the details and key elements of the book were included in the film.",Eragon
998,numair_ftp,Do not waste your money!,1,17 December 2006,"OK so i am a big fan of the books and have read them several times and enjoyed them. I figured i would give the movie a shot and see how it went. Being a movie i knew they would have to cut a lot but i figured if they could do alright with Lord of the Rings they might be able to do good by another High Fantasy Novel... I got two friends to go with me, one who had read the book and one that had not. Perhaps one of the best parts of the movies is the CG Dragon she looks very pretty. Thats were it stops. The movie is riddled with actors who CAnnot act. The main character being one of them. I don't know what it is but the dude that plays Ajihad, but he can Act as we have seen him in several movies and know it so...maybe bad acting skills was a criterion for the movie. But perhaps what bothered me most was the way the story was either butchered or just stupid. At one point the dragon goes from being a little baby barely being able to fly than she comes soaring back down full grown....i was staring at the screen wondering .... What The... just happened , although it bothered me i let them have that one cause i figured it was just them speeding up the book. Fine. Heres one point the bothered me too....Arya (the so-called ""beautiful elven princess"") Is Old....elf's are ageless....and i know its nitpicking but...she didn't have pointed ears?!?! I Was like Huh?? so basically the main female roll is portrayed by an old white woman...so disappointed. That one bothered me. Another thing that Really really bothered me was how the cheesy it up with Eragon giving speeches about the crap....made me sick But another thing that bothered me most......They cut The Dwarfs Completely out of it! If u read the book u know the Varden live in a Dwarven strong hold....nope in the movie u don't even See a dwarf. From the time Eragon gets to Varden to the end of the movie is about 12 minutes.... book butcheredOK so if u have read the books u will be so disappointed with the combo of bad actors and plot butchery u will want to vomit. And if u haven't read the books the movie will make absolutely no Sense to u and you will most likely think it Very stupid (as my friend did).... so basically hope the author sticks to writing at stops making movies.... Cause this one bit the big one!",Eragon
999,lawbaby61,Bad Job,4,18 December 2006,"I liked the books but was disappointed in the movie. I really understood that they had to change things for a shorter movie and that they didn't have the budget of say, ""Lord of the Rings"" but ... come on ... they changed too much ... and did not include enough information to have the story make sense. It reminded me of what ""they"" did to ""Dune."" And it would not have been so hard to have it make sense - a couple of montage scenes to get you through the time (Saphira growing up, traveling and training with Brom, Murtagh, etc.) and it would have been much better.Oh, and why didn't Arya have pointed ears? Elves have pointed ears!!! I can't imagine that they will do a sequel given how bad this movie was but ...",Eragon
1000,jasbdragon,This movie should have been so great...,1,17 December 2006,"Why, I just want to know why this movie have been made? Christopher Paolini sure crying right now, because is great ""chef-d'oeuvre"" have been destruct by peoples who don't know how to adapt a screenplay and made a movie!!! A storyline broken. A screenplay with no sense (How will they made the second??? I hope they just don't) an artistic direction....wait, what artistic direction? Two choice....He was blind or he didn't read the book! come on!!! a dragon with bird wings???? where is the volcano of the dwarfs, the fabulous city in the mountain??? Aria IS AN ELF!!! my god, elf ears sell 2$ every were!!! do something!!! and I just don't want to talk about the urgals....what was that???? to much incompetents creating this movie made the worst fantastic movie adaptation ever.

1001,cthd1991,this movie sucks,1,17 December 2006,"I hated this movie. it was the worst ever. they wasted their time and money on this film. they didn't even get the character Saphira right. she has spikes!! No horns!! Didn't follow anything!!!!! how could the Ra'zac attack Carvahall in Eldest if they were killed in this dumb movie. Where's the stupid Hadarac Desert?? I think the coolest part in the book was when Eragon got water from the ground. Murtagh didn't want to go near the Varden in the book. he was really excited to go to the Varden in the stupid movie!! the only thing they got right were the names of the characters that they mentioned. stupid people. you make me sick. i will tell no one to see this movie.i will tell people not to see it. if you gave me a million dollars to watch this movie i will not do it. i have a million mistakes they made in the stupid movie!! if you don't agree with me then you have never read the books, or you haven't seen the movie.

1002,karmadello,Disappionting effort,4,18 December 2006,"I feel sorry for Christopher Paolini. To think that his story has been turned into so much dribble is saddening. Apart from the fact that the movies story was weak, it was too far off the book it may as well have been called ""A farm boy and his dragon"". Firstly, Carvahall is too far away from any main city for soldiers to patrol on a regular basis, Sloan hates Eragon more and his daughter isn't even in it. Consider the fact that Katrina (Sloan's daughter) is one of the main reason for events that happen in the second book and it just doesn't seem right to leave her character out. Horst is shown as weak, and his son's were never recruited in the book. Roran left to work for another man so he could save up for a life with Katrina, not to run away and hide from the Empire. Brom was a much stronger character in the book. And I'm only talking about the first 10 minutes! Arya was an Elf. Not human, though who could tell? Murtagh was with Eragon longer than shown and rescued him when he was captured, and he wasn't even kidnapped at the end or given a storyline at all. Arya wasn't awake throughout most of the book. She also went to Ilismera WITH Eragon, so he can complete his training at the end. This is just the changes in the story...look at the movie with out the book and you get a story that isn't explained, characters that don't know whats going on, a major battle scene that lasted 5 minutes and an evil king that doesn't leave his room throughout the entire movie. The final battle scene between Eragon and Durza was too weak to even call a battle. Saphirra was a weak character, not giving enough advise to Eragon. And why would Murtagh go to all the trouble of helping Eragon get to the Varden (and he was quite happy to do so) when he knew that they would imprison him on first site. All in all Eragon was a major disappointment to its loyal book reading fans, and a let down to fantasy movie buffs. Poor effort.",Eragon

Very Disappointing:-(,2,18 December 2006,"Like most of those who have read the books, I was greatly looking forward to this movie....I had Great Expectations, after reading the books....unfortunately.....I hate to report that I was VERY disappointed.All I can say about this movie is....oh me....what a flub. The books are magnificent-they are great material to work with but obviously these movie makers didn't read past page 2. Everyone knows that there is no way to fit every detail of a 400+ paged book into one movie, however, totally changing the story for a film is a terrible idea. ( Especially when it is done in very poor taste). They never give you a chance to even care about the characters, They added irrelevant things in but left out key themes of the book...What were they thinking?? They needed to tell more of the root of the adventure,...Out of the movie I would estimate 3% is true to the book. I can't imagine how choppy and confusing it must be for those who have not read the book.....I was still confused at times because of the many changes....I mean there were so many disappointments I could never name them all... The characters were so bland and miscast when compared to the characters in the book..I mean I thought the Urguls were creatures with horns, not men that worked for Miami ink. The dwarfs looked pretty tall for dwarfs and the list goes on and on... They just didn't get much right at all...... not to mention cutting out everything that links book one to book two...it was just poor planning....there seemed to be no understanding or respect for the true story...it lacked the passion of someone who had read and enjoyed the books.....it was like a jumbled mess...like a book report you forgot about and it is was due the next day and you haven't read the book so you just kind of make it up as you go along- kind of thing...I just wonder what poor Christopher Paolini is thinking after watching this train wreck....Poor guy I would be furious....(where is Peter Jackson when we need him?) And speaking of LOTR....I mean could it be any more obvious than the shots of them riding though the beautiful landscape....wait a minute haven't we seen something like this before??...Where is the originality??....it seems to me the movie is just a poor attempt to emulate the epic fantasy movies of the past to make the $$$$.....It had such potential to be a great trilogy.....what a waste of a great story....maybe they will trash it and make another one with a director and screen writer who have actually read the story. I have to say one last thing before I stop rambling on IF YOU HAVE NOT READ THE BOOKS DO NOT LET THIS DETER YOU FROM DOING SO...They are a good read if you like LOTR of Harry Potter-fantasy/adventure...really good books.....JUST A TERRIBLE MOVIE!!!",Eragon

I was pretty excited to see this movie when I noticed posters for it in the theaters. I'm not a very harsh movie critic, in fact this is the first time that I have ever really hated a movie (and made it known), but my brother and I sat and ripped on this movie for an hour after watching it. FOX should not have even bothered to make this movie if they are going to do that bad of a job at it. If I were them I wouldn't even bother with the next 2.

I have never been so let down. the plot was no where near the book, they left out key points from the book, like Brom and Eragon meeting his friend, how the shade was slain and many other key points. this movie made Gigli look good. Stefen Fangmeier should give everyone who saw it a refund. the movie couldn't be saved with John Malkovich. the kid that played Eragon was good but I feel bad for him having to be in a bad movie. THe battle scenes were too drawn out and the only rewarding factor was that after 2 hours I could finally leave the theatre. Joss Stone was great in the movie. too bad it was too short.

And the war? the fighting scene between eragon and the shades pretty cool, but the other? man, they could've done better, u know... if i have to compare this movie with LOTR, Harry Potter, and Narnia, this is out. those three movies (esp LOTR) was better, this is much alike Harry Potter 3 (which i think the worse HP movies compare with other) with too many drama and unimportant detail. why creating a new details while the book already providing a lots of even better details? the special effect pretty cool but not wonderful, sorry but i guess 5 is what this movie deserve, i could give 6 but i'm too disappoint for that...",Eragon
1008,xxLavanderxx,Total lack of respect for the fans,1,18 December 2006,"It is obvious the screen writer did not read the books or else, decided to make up his own retarded story. I can't understand how such good actors agreed to participate in this movie. The main events and character's personalities are omitted or changed for dull and cheesy ones. I won't even begin to complain for the drastic changes in the physical appearance of the characters: after witnessing the total disrespect for the characters' personality (as described in the book) I realise it's the least of the trespasses. Not even the main character is allowed to evolve from a farm boy to a dragon rider, delivering empty lines from the beginning right to the end. Obviously after changing the personalities and the interrelationships of the characters, the second part has already been mutilated before even existing as a movie. I feel seriously offended. There should be a law against the slaughtering of someone else's work and respect for the fans who can read. I was so upset while watching the movie, I have been unfair to the photography department. Sorry. Beautiful work. Also the dragon is, although not as described in the book, quite nice, if it wasn't for her fairy Godmother's voice.",Eragon

What were they thinking? This guy turned Jurassic Park III into Godzilla! Peter Buchman had good material to work from, but apparently he reads two chapters of Eragon and tossed it out the window.No effort was made to show how Eragon learnt magic, how Saphira grew, how the two learnt to communicate, how Brom guided the young boy and taught him the old ways of the Shur'tugal.

This movie was a complete disgrace to the the book. and i believe that the director let down the many fans of Christopher. I don't even know how they are going to start off the 2nd movie the way they ended it. Murtagh comes in way to early, Brom doesn't die because of saving eragon from a shade, and what the h0ell is up with this new power? the ability for eragon to have saphira's eye sight? are you kidding me? and why are they not mentioning the fact that there are elves and dwarfs in this movie??? arya doesn't even have elf ears. i just don't understand what these people were thinking. oh, and why is Angelina the herbalist set out to look like a prostitute? plus she doesn't even give eragon his full future prediction. and where is katrina going to come into play with all this? roran leaves because he doesn't wanna go to the army?? um thats not whats suppose to happen.",Eragon

Then Bron ( Jeremy Irons ) takes Eragon ( Ed Speleers) under his wing and guides him in magic, sword skills, and Dragon ways. They follow KEY POINTS of the book. They leave out traveling time, minor scrambles and the desert. They also don't spend time used in the book to describe everything! It maybe be a bad movie for some people. But, some people may like it. I respect all, and I know that it wasn't perfect. You need to give people more credit. They spent months working on this and all you can do is dis it. Think about what they go through, its not just fun. They did also leave out the cat and Katrina. Even though they credit her. I hope to see Eldest in theaters and I also hope to see Eragon on DVD.

I was so excited when I found out there was an Eragon movie coming out. I was one of the fans that went and saw the movie the 1st session of the first day that it came out. I know that a lot of people that have read the book were upset about the movie and how it was done and the changes from the book, I was a little upset about some of the changes too. However like any other film adaption of a book, there has to be changes made for the time of the movie to be reasonable as well as connecting ideas for the viewers to understand if they haven't read the book. When you think about the length of the book, the director and crew did and good job at fitting in all the essential parts, even if changes had to be made that sadly aren't exactly the same as the book version. Despite some changes I still thought it was a great movie and deserves heaps of credit!!! I greatly enjoyed the movie and so did all of my friends who saw it. The CGI and special effects are amazing! The soundtrack is inspiring and the cast all deserve lots of credit for their brilliant performances. Eragon is a great film and should be enjoyed by fans who have read the book and those who haven't. To sum up, Eragon is a great fantasy film and should be enjoyed by all Fantasy lovers.

It was and me and five of my friends cursed it wondering how they would ever make another movie if Eragon didn't even go to Elesmera. The performances were less than impressing.

Stefen Fangmeier should stick to visual effects not directing. My son (12 yrs) read the book also and was very disappointed. If you don't have the budget to do a movie right, then don't bother. It's like they were trying to squeeze the movie and in doing so they cut out important parts. Definitely not one for the DVD collection. Too bad Paolini gave up control of the script.

To paolini i think you may have ruined your first book by letting that writer guy do write the script and don't let them use him for eldest (if they make a movie).i think the cast was good though, ed speilers did a good job playing eragon, i like everyone except the guy who played mugtagh, i didn't get tn same feeling as i did in the book when i read about him.",Eragon
1019,firebears369,What a disappointment!!!,1,18 December 2006,"I stumbled upon the book 'Eragon' quite by accident, but I was immediately taken in by the richness of the story line and the vivid description that Christopher Paonili wove into his tome. Naturally, I was thrilled when I heard that the book had been made into a movie. I had recently read 'Eragon' yet again, so I was eager to see how the story was brought to life on the big screen.And thats where my excitement ended. I am well aware that an entire book is difficult to present in the movie format; I'm still miffed that so much detail was left out of 'Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire'. Limitations being as they may, there is no earthly explanation for the butcher job that the producers called a movie. Huge sections of the plot were left out, diminishing a great deal of the power of the story. The dialogue reminded me of the cheesy slop that occupies Saturday morning cartoons. Furthermore, most of the characters spent their on screen time brooding and obviously posing for the shot as opposed to acting out the story.Further injustice was suffered by the portrayal of Saphira and her link to Eragon. Certainly the CGI was well done, I do have to acknowledge that. However, little was done to convey the link between dragon and rider and how they grew together.All in all, I find myself asking if the writers/producers did any more then read the jacket cover when preparing to make this film. Hopefully, greater effort and care will be put into the making of Eldest.",Eragon
1020,fruitysmile101,its was good,7,18 December 2006,"Okay.. well to many of the people who read the book all they say is "" it could have been better, they left out so much"" and yes that is true but i mean have you even thought they might be saving stuff for the next movie. But for the people who have no read the book this gives them a close over view of the movie and if they are really interested in the movie then they can go read the book. But personally i liked the movie, yes they could have done better. They left out a lot of details including some people but it doesn't really change the story that much. If they do make the next movie they will probably include the other details so they can say everything all at once. They summed up the story and i thought it was pretty good.",Eragon
1021,RavenTheGoddessOfNight,This is my ranting about the movie Eragon,1,18 December 2006,"Basically, it sucked. It's like they took the characters and made up their own story line. It has like no connection to the book. It goes way way too fast and it doesn't go by the book at all. If they ever make the sequel to it (Eldest) I don't want to see it. They left the ending Eragon all screwy meaning that they couldn't do a thing for Eldest and probably make it even worse then Eragon. I guess if you don't compare it to the book it's an OK movie but it still sucks and I don't even wanna recommend watching it. Yes, it was that bad. I mean, they like made the book look totally bad and not readable. Take my word for it, read the book, forget about the movie.",Eragon
1022,erica_kaminski,Worth seeing,8,25 December 2006,"Even though the movie doesn't really flow the same way the book does and they do leave out quite a bit, I think they handled the story line with dignity and respect to the author. Yes, Brom dies differently than in the novel, but he still does so with honor. To compare this with the book and say this is a bad movie is wrong. The special effects are great and the dragon is fantastic. I think the actors did a good job and I loved Jeremy Irons' character. I have to admit that I thought they would make this movie very cheesy and I would walk away disappointed, but I think this is definitely a movie worth seeing and would definitely go see it again. It kept me on the edge of my seat and ready to see the next movie. My daughter and I, both of whom have read this book, agree. A good family movie.",Eragon
1023,telkakenderkat,Highly Disappointed.,1,19 December 2006,"I ended up with free passes to see this movie on the 14th. I was geeked. I've read Eragon. Im almost done with Eldest. I looked forward to seeing a good movie adaptation of a book I highly enjoyed.Instead, I left with only one question in my mind. How do they take a book, that for the age of the author and taking into account a lot of other factors, was an incredibly read, a world rich in culture, races of beings that were described SO vividly, and make it a movie LESS than two hours?! This baffles me still. So many things were cut out entirely. There was no explanation of Eragon's background really.. hell there was no explanation of ANY of the characters backgrounds much. They took one key character Brahm, and made him so pathetically obvious that it was just like well.. gee we didn't see THAT coming.. when the book hid his true role quite well .. Hell, even Durza, the shade , while he had some sweet makeup and good acting.. was not accurate..So all in all my final conclusion of this film is this: If they had spent less money on the CGI, and instead bothered to put even a quarter as much time into the plot, this could have been a great movie. It had an incredible cast with some of my favorite actors.. but it seemed like the script was just thrown together after a couple of nights thought and with barely a glance to the real story going on.",Eragon
1024,aramisdrm,Why not Peter Jackson?,1,19 December 2006,"If you have read the book, this is the worst cinematic interpretation of all time. Never have I scene such a blatant disregard for literature from Hollywood. How can Tolkein, Grisham, S. King, Anne Rice, and J.K. Rowling have fairly good adaptations of books hit the screen, and Paolini fall so flat? Simple, Hollywood ran all over him in his youth, and his brilliant story was chopped into fish bait. Even if you haven't read the book, the editing is choppy and the geography undefined. If there were ever a time for a remake, this is it. Give the book to Jackson, or Chris Columbus... someone who knows how to put a fantasy novel on the screen. Remake it so well that the other two parts of the story are sure to be made as well.The only thing that was decent ( and I mean decent, not extraordinary) was the special effects of the final battle, but that doesn't remotely begin to make up for the hour and a half of frustration that comes prior to the scene.Everyone should write a letter expressing their disgust.",Eragon
1025,txalikat,How did it stray so far?,3,19 December 2006,"Had I never read the book, I would have found this movie a little rushed, but decently entertaining. However, I have read the book and I found myself sorely disappointed by this movie. How did it stray so far from a book that was outstanding the way it was? I understand the need to leave a few things out for time's sake, but this went way beyond that with a few stupid changes that just left me annoyed and upset.1. They made Roran look like a coward. He left to run away? How hard was it to have him say that he was leaving because he was offered a job and he wanted to take it so he could marry? I mean, that is what the book says. 2. Angela talks about herself in third person? Since when??? And where oh where was Solembum the werecat? 3. Tronjheim looked like a third world country, complete with stick huts. How did it go from a glittering jewel in the middle of a volcano to a ramshackle collection of twigs? I admit that this was the biggest letdown for me. I couldn't immerse myself in the world that captivated me in the books. 4. The Razac were, well, they were creepy and disgusting but they weren't the nightmarish creatures of the book.Overall I was sorely letdown by this movie. They could have done so much better. If this is the way they plan on doing the second movie, I won't be watching it.",Eragon
1026,Dragoncat,Really wanted to love it,6,19 December 2006,"I saw Eragon and it was good not great as I had hoped and not as good as it could have been. needed to be about a hour longer and cover more that was in the book and follow the book better. Though a couple of the changes scenes where better than the book. But I am not giving up on the second movie and have hope that the writers and director read these comments and TAKE NOTE and that Christopher has more impute on the script. the Special effects are great and Sephira is great. and had the perfect voice just I had imagined from reading the book. It is a movie worth seeing but just don't go in with real high expectations, but with hope that the next one will be better. The producers and director need to know that we will sit through a 3 1/2 hour movie if it is good and Eragon could be great.",Eragon
1027,freespirit185,If I hadn't read the book...,5,19 December 2006,"I had read both Eragon and Eldest before seeing this movie, and was extremely excited when this movie came out. Unfortunately, I was VERY disappointed. If I hadn't read the book, it would have been an awesome movie. However, I did, and the movie strayed so far from the book. Within the first 5 minutes of the movie they started straying. First off, Katrina wasn't even mentioned in the movie, and that was why Roran was leaving his farm, so he could make money to start a home for him and Katrina. NOT because he wanted to evade the army (which, by the way, wasn't even in the book. Also, Saphira didn't name herself and tell Eragon that he was a rider...after speaking with Brom, Eragon named her himself. Also, Gallbatorix wasn't even in the first book, just the aspect of him, and you don't find out about the fact that he was a dragon and a rider until the second book, not at the end of the movie. AND the war that went on between Gallbatorix and the Varden didn't happen until after Eragon spent some time in the Varden, and Murtagh ended up being captured by Urgals after the war, and the king of the Varden ended up being killed. Another thing that I was very mad about was the fact that Arya was supposed to be unconscious for a few days after being captured...she was supposed to put herself in a deep sleep in order to evade the Shades poison. And the visions that Eragon had of her was supposed to be of her in the the jail cell, not in a forest. Anyways, those are some of the many aspects that they strayed from. I was sadly disappointed. Again, if I hadn't of read the book, I would have enjoyed the movie. But I did, and the book is FAR better than the movie.",Eragon
1028,Talon11339,A warning for Paolini fans.,1,8 January 2007,"If you are a fan of the book that Paolini wrote and the story it tells AVOID THIS MOVIE LIKE THE PLAGUE!!! It was like the script writers never even read the book. Beloved characters were either left out entirely or mangled beyond all recognition. Locations were dropped or completely distorted. There were no deep political intrigues or agendas. There was no personal growth. Just a bunch of disjointed and mindless scenes of CGI and panning country side.Brom was not the insightful and wise mentor we love, but a drunken, washed-up rider who was whining over the fact that he killed Morzan and there by the last living dragon (Even though Shruikan was still alive, go figure). His main goal is to redeem himself by bringing the newest rider to the Varden. He was a Varden boyscout, touting them as the greatest thing ever rather than the tangled web of politics he saw them as in the book.Teirm is completely dropped. Angela makes a bit appearance as a scantly clad seer that does a cheesy foretelling and then is forgotten about. No Solembum. Period. At all.The Razac are killed by Eragon and the Shade kills Brom in a very lame diving save that is worthy of a cheesy 70's TV show.The Varden live in a dank cave and simple village. No Dwarfs. No twins, just some human wizard looking guy that does no magic in the movie. The varden are 1 dimensional, led by Ajihad who is portrayed as hot tempered and small minded. There are many more inconsistencies, but those are some of the worst. I stayed through the whole this with the same morbid curiosity that grips the on-lookers of a horrendous car wreck, waiting to see just how bad things were going to get. It is an unforgivable atrocity and should be shoved under the rug and never spoken of again.",Eragon
1029,deathtoll2006,I've never walked out on a movie in my life... until now.,1,19 December 2006,"Here's the short version I give people that ask what I thought: I've never walked out on a movie in my life... until now.Imagine a Sci-Fi 'B' movie. Now cut the quality in half. Now make it have nothing to do with the book. Now you have Eragon the Movie.Yes. It was THAT bad.The long version: (WARNING: Contains spoilers!) Here's the biggest issue: The only thing the movie and the book had in common were the names and a very general plot. It could have been named a LotR rip-off as soon as anything else, if not for the names.Eragon and Brom's personalities were pratically switched, and Sephera (sorry about spellings, I don't have time to look them all up) essentially had no personality. In a vein attempt to make some aspects like the book (e.g. Brom's tomb), they made stack contradictions. Brom didn't get along in the slightest with the other characters in the movie, yet they were all like ""We have to preserve him for all eternity!"". This made perfect sense in the book, but none in the movie.If the movie had been longer and taken time to develop the characters, then this may not have been an issue, even if they remained separate from the personalities from the book.I can understand the need to cut corners for time and budget constraints, but things were cut from the wrong places. One example is the approach to the mountains across the desert: Nothing is ever said about there being Eargles around, until the statement ""The Eargles are almost on us!"". If I'd not read the book, my response would have been ""Huh? What Eargles? Where the hell did they come from!"" Related to this is the transporting of the Elf. This is one thing that pisses me off every time I see a fantasy-book-made-movie. The producers seem to think that it will somehow make things better if the female character plays a larger role than in the book. The book was written that way for a REASON, idiots... So why did they decide it was important to have her awake and helpful the entire journey, when you never even see her conscious until just before the final battle? Hell if I know... *visibly calms himself* Enough ranting about that...Basically, my overall opinion was that this movie felt like a pieced together mess loosely based on a best-selling book in an attempt to make tons of money without spending any, with acceptable acting and a well animated dragon.",Eragon
1030,bernadette104,Eragon,9,19 December 2006,"I haven't read any of the books in this series and so went into this film with no preconceptions whatsoever. It was absolutely amazing. The special effects, the dialogue, the way the characters interacted with each other in the ways they did....I would recommend it to everybody that loves a good battle. I think the way they made the dragon was amazing and the technology involved has really left the film all the better. It was a little bit violent, I think the rating should have been slightly higher but it was still great. A bit reminiscent in scenery and set of the LOTR trilogy but it was still beautiful. Well filmed, well cast (Jeremy Irons' voice is so sexy!) and a very good film in general. I can't wait for parts 2 and 3 to come out. The only thing that let it down a little was that it took a little while to get started and as I hadn't read the books in advance, it did take me a while to follow it. However, it ends with a cliff hanger, ready for the next part to come and continue the story.",Eragon

1032,nox_bear,I have not read the books but I did see the movie,8,19 December 2006,"My wife really wanted to go see this movie. She had it set up for us to go as soon as she found out that it was coming to the screen. I wasn't totally excited about it, but she could have picked a much worse movie to go see. After seeing how much publicity was being put into this movie and showing as much of it as they where on TV, I started to get even more nervous. If the publishers are so worried about the movie that they have to push it on us this hard... there has to be problems. My wife and I went with another couple, who after hearing and reading some not so good reviews, wasn't to thrilled about seeing Eragon.After watching the movie, I left feeling I had seen a better movie than more than half the people here say it was. Yes, there was some strange parts and cheese lines, but all in all I think it was a good movie. As Fantasy movies go, I would say its at least in the top 10. It also has given me a desire to read the books. I may have a different view than most people, by seeing the movie before reading the book. I like it this way though. I don't have a preconceived notion of what the movie should be like. I get to watch the movie for what it is. I good movie about a cool Female dragon and a boy who has to become a man before he's ready. Did I really care that there where elves and I didn't know they where elves, because they didn't dress or really look like elves? No, not really. It didn't matter to me one bit, but to the people that read the books, they where in an up-roar because of it.All in all, I liked the movie. I'll buy it when it comes out for sale on DVD. I'll buy the books and read them. I'll go see the next movie if it comes to light.Thanks for your time, Bear",Eragon
1033,hund-11,A farm boy gets a dragon and has adventures.,3,19 December 2006,"So I heard from a friend that the movie Eragon was entertaining but had nothing to do with the book. I read the book. It's not like the book, and it's not entertaining. The plot is week, and the writing is poor. Without reading the book ( which is very good ) the viewer wouldn't understand this movie at all, but if you did read it, then this movie will irritate you. Half of the characters are missing. The characters that are included are ""wrong"". If you go to see a Potter movie and it has no Ron, Malfoy, or Snape and Dumbeldore says one line and the story takes place at Wal-Mart; than the movie could have been written by the Eragon people. It's a shame to see this happen to such a good story. Oh, by the way, Hagrid is clean shaven and loves sushi.",Eragon
1034,bclark68,Interesting...,9,20 December 2006,"I think people have been a little too hard on this film. I personally only read the synopsis of Eragon included with Eldest, but they didn't leave anything incredibly major out. While it does have it's share of cheesy one-liners and stilled acting, it is a good adaption of the book and I think Ed Speelers did extraordinarily well for a newcomer. And to those who say Eldest will be screwed up, I read Eldest cover to cover an I didn't see much that would completely throw off the plot. Minor things were changed, such as the way Brom died, and where Darzha died.I believe there was something to do with a giant sapphire of the sort. Don't be too hard of the portrayal of Eragon. It is extremely difficult to act believably in front of a camera, rather than an audience. It takes a lot of getting used to.",Eragon
1035,OpheliaDarling,One very excellent movie (emphasis on the word movie),10,21 December 2006,"Take my comments with a grain of salt, as I have never read Eragon nor Eldest.I walked in to see this movie with no idea what it was about and no expectations as to quality. Boy, was I surprised! I found that it, more than any other movie I have seen in my life, was emotionally gripping. I was laughing, crying, and on the edge of my seat throughout the whole thing. I have been back to see it two more times, and intend to go a third and fourth.Why did I love this movie so much when it was so disliked by others outside of the 10-and-under set? Because I had no expectations. True, the movie (and book, as I understand it after researching it a bit) derive much of their content from other fantasy works. True, the movie differs dramatically from the book. So let the movie stand on its own, as a different story, a story based in the world of Eragon and based upon the book, but not a movie of the book.Taken on its own through unbiased eyes, I found the movie to be fantastic. Yes, there was some cheesy dialog. Yes, there were some continuity and plot errors. But they were not significant enough to detract from an overall wonderful movie experience.I do not promise that everyone will find Eragon as wonderful as I did, even if every moviegoer judged the film just as a film and not as an adaptation of a book.

So many essential elements were missing, and not just from the book, but elements essential for a good film in general. The dialogue was bad, the themes were all messed up, characters were completely ruined, and not to mention the interactions between characters.My advice: Stefen Fangmeier needs to go back to doing visual effects supervising, because all those movies were good.",Eragon

YOu can advertise a movie as the motion picture of the year then give avid fans crap! plus you just killed or left out most of the important info for the next book/movie......The ray Zack are important for the 3rd movie/book and are not created by DURza and are not that easy to kill, plus the whole reason they left was to kill the ray Zack....Jesus!!! the directors/writers must not have read the books at all, if I was CHris i would be upset!!!!!!!!!it sullies his books",Eragon

Please remember the good parts of the film too. Saphira looked wonderful, and they chose great actors for Eragon, Brom, and Ajihad. I just advise everyone to stop being pessimists. Remember, Christopher Paolini had no hand in writing the script or choosing the actors, like J.K. Rowling. Of course the movie was going to be a whole lot different from the book.

Do you think the most intelligent and advanced being in the world would sound like Mrs. Doubtfire? 3. Why is no one else bothered about the fact that the elves were native American? hm?

I haven't read the book, so I can not comment on if it hold the story sufficiently or not, but the movie it's just .. it shouldn't be even released.. Why? It starts pretty good though.. young Eragon finds the dragon egg. The dragon hatches out. They have fun together.. and stop. These are to the only good parts. After that he just rides, and rides and rides.. awfully long taking scenes of two horse-riders in the mountains... that's enough, I won't comment on the plot any longer.. you can read the movie overview. The setting is very weak, the environment changes between five or six major scenes. (evil castle, mountains, his uncle's house, village in the swamps, and the final battle at the fort), nothing more.. all of them look very cheap and a sort of unfinished, why? Was the budget too low? The dialogs.. after 45 minutes of the movies you are just fed up of the dialogs and comments of the characters, they sound like thirteen years old girl would write them. By the end of the movie you are just angry and you just wish that it would be shot without the dialogs - just the movie and music. Anyway. It's not worth to go to the cinema and to see it. I do not support movie piracy, but if you want to see this movie, just download it somewhere, because it isn't worth a penny.. great disappointment..",Eragon

1042,glen_war,The movie moves way too fast,4,20 December 2006,"As a reader and viewer of fantasy books and movies over the past 55 years, I was deeply saddened to see the speed with which the movie progressed the plot of the book. It reminds me of trying to listen to an old record, by running your fingers over the ridges of the record. All of the high spots were there, but the substance of the book was missing. Detail is missing! Very important details, from beginning to end were either left out or poorly brought to light. This book was written by the author to inspire the imagination of the reader. This movie was developed to try and bring the company revenue. It was poorly conceived, badly executed and IMHO mismanaged. For those interested in Fantasy, read the book then wait for Jackson (Lord of the Rings) to make the movie. Then you'll see a fantasy movie worth watching.",Eragon
1043,mrs-mcmanus,Let's call it as we see it.,1,20 December 2006,"I tell my students to call it as they see it. If someone would be crushed by a scathing review, so be it. These Hollywood ""hotshots' need to get the hint that the public expectations for a true representation of a best-selling novel are more important that their ""artistic vision."" And when I say ""artistic vision,"" I mean stupidity and downright ignorance. Paolini's Eragon did not sell the way it did because it was merely some pulp fiction about a dragon; rather, it sold because it has a strong storyline, compelling characters, and timeless message. Not to mention that it was written by a 16 year-old boy.The most egregious evils lay within the following three reasons. First, as it is, the entire film is told as exposition. Perhaps this was done purposefully; after all, this is the first installment of a trilogy. However, it should be a complete story regardless. The writer tells the viewer what is going on, rather than showing the viewer what is supposed to happen. It's like writing a paragraph with only statements and leaving out the 3-5 sentences of elaboration for each. It is the worst kind of highlight paper. Truly by the end of the film, you are only waiting for the story to begin. But honestly, by the end of the movie, you just want to be put out of your misery. Second, the characters are static and boring. The viewer gets no sense of emotional depth to any of the characters. By limiting the character development, the trilogy itself is severely limited. By the time the film reached the final battle scene, instead of empathizing with the characters, I laughed at them. The music told me that I should feel excitement, frustration, and even sadness, but all I could do was laugh. The laughter was uncomfortable and verging on hysteria (I was deeply wounded by this film), but it was laughter nonetheless. For example, when Eragon wakes after the final battle is won, he looks upon Murtagh's friendly and sympathetic countenance. Eragon asks if Saphira is all right and Murtagh replies, ""Some friends can never be replaced"" Leading the viewer to think that Saphira may be dead. Eragon is clearly distraught, and at this point, as a viewer, you should be crying. But in a whirlwind, Saphira appears, and Murtagh happily proclaims something like, ""But luckily, they don't have to!"" And at that point, I started laughing. A loud, raucous laugh came out of me and I had no control over it. I thought, ""Gee, that Murtagh! He sure is a practical joker- he almost had me there!"" Because, you know, that's what pals do: they pretend that their friend's best friend has died, and then they can have a good laugh over it. Ha ha! Yeah, right. The viewer has no sense of the camaraderie between these characters because at the end of the film, we still don't even really know who they are, much less have a sense of their relationship to one another. Third, as a result of the previous two reasons, the story has no message worth telling. The novel is infused with themes about friendship, tolerance, caring, and justice; however, each becomes lost in this nightmare that Fang-who-ever had wrought. It is the most severe of all sins, as this film will be more widely accessible and distribute than the novel itself. For all those who walk out of the theater thinking this movie was good, whether or not they have read the novel, they are being deceived. They are being deceived into thinking that this garbage is all that this novel is or could be. With The Lord of the Rings, Peter Jackson proved that a significant novel with a clearly defined fantasy world can be made with thoughtfulness, grace, and beauty. Eragon, the movie, contains none of those ideals. With a poorly written script by Peter Buchman, widely known for his work on War Magician and Jurrasic Park 3 (Did anyone even see that?), and slipshod production values, the film falls flat on it's face. All good stories leave the reader with something to think about, but this one just left me thinking, ""I paid $9 for this?""True, the novel is a significant work that should be made into a film. However, I can't see how, in the universe that has been created by the filmmakers, that the full trilogy can be told with any vestige of the original story arc. What this Fangmeier moron has done is a true disservice to Paolini, the Inheritance trilogy, the fans and general public, and most significantly, himself. This is his directorial debut, and it is a pathetic interpretation. Something amazing could have been done here. But what I saw was a lazy and wretched re- working of a story that should have simply been told as it was written. For this, as a teacher, I must give Stefen What's-his-name and his entire production crew an F because his work was off-topic and irrelevant.",Eragon

I don't know if it was to save money or to put their own flavor on it, but they took a terrific book and ABSOLUTELY RUINED IT! Roran's reason for leaving Carvahall? The egg shape and color? When the egg hatched? How the dragon was named? The way the Raczak looked and dressed? No sores on Eragon's thighs from the first flight? Why Eragon left Carvahall. The horses? That's in the beginning of the book. There is so much wrong with this presentation that I could honestly say that aside from the names used in the book, there is no connection between Paoli's book and this piece of cinematography. The journey? The urgals? The mayhem that they left? Daret?...on stilts over water? Angela: Her age and looks? Not telling anyone about the fortune telling. Jeod. Arya not comatose. Brom's death. Murtagh. No dwarfs. No Elves. No Kull. No battle outside of the dwarfs entry on the lake. No TWINS! No Isidar Mithrim (OK, so I am not great at spelling.) Asuada not per the book. Farthen Dur??? Tronjeim??? The battle with only Urgals in the book now has soldiers. And what in the heck was this crap with Durza riding this imaginary dragon??? It was better when the twins and Durza tricked Eragon into going to help the twins and then getting Eragon realizing that he had to confront Durza.I expected...well...more. Where is Peter Jackson when you need him?What a piece of crockery. My children and I all read the book and were severely disappointed.",Eragon

(I was very disappointed in this production) Brom was killed by the Razac and not by Durza. And he was not alive when they, Murtagh and Eragon went to get Arya, who was inconsonance the entire time due to the poisoning. Also what about Ronan running away (whatever ?) The Empire (oops, I mean the Kings Army) was not in Charvahall taking boys. You also never really read about Galbatorixdoing anything, all you read about is in the third party about him. Brom talks about him as well as Jeod, (where is he the movie?) Saphria is also made to be inept in the movie when she is usually calm and understanding. (bad portrayal of her. Just a few more points. Angela, what was that temptress? And Jeod he's important. The Furthen Dur and the dwarfs where were they? The Twin's, The Rose, Durza on a smoky dragon. There were so many flaws with the movie I wonder if he even read the book or read the cliff notes. So very disappointing. My boyfriend also asked when we were going to see the Ewoks?",Eragon

When I saw it, I couldn't believe how awful it was. I suppose it would be okay if you didn't read the books, but there was lots of things that were incredibly important to the book that were just left out. My friends that had read it all agreed with me. I don't see how they're going to make a decent movie for Eldest when that comes around. They sort of just threw out things that were pretty important that you wouldn't find out until late in the book. Murtagh just kind of appeared, never really explored his character. The revelation of Brom being a Rider was too early, and he came out of no where and got shot with an arrow. The Raazac were killed with relative ease, and Arya was fine when Eragon rescued her. Overall, the movie could have been called ""based loosely on events from the book Eragon, but not really anything like the book.""",Eragon

I was getting excited when I heard it was being made into a movie, but was severely disappointed with the movie as it was really bad and left a bad taste. I seriously hope that the producers for the next film consider following the storyline a bit more and make it more interesting and stimulating for movie-goers. I won't recommend this movie to my friends, definitely. Although it was all hype before the actual release, I don't think many people actually felt the hype after watching the movie itself.",Eragon

1049,MKeller14-1,Change the movie name to Saphira and it is OK,7,22 December 2006,"Let me start by saying I didn't read the books before seeing the movie but I am reading Eragon now. I enjoyed the movie. Not great but not bad. One of the most nagging problems with this movie has it was way to short and seemed like it was in fast forward most of the movie. If they would have increased this movie to 2 hours to 2 and a half hours I think it would have been a very good movie (hopefully the DVD will have more added in). The acting by Rachel Weisz was fantastic. Jeremy Irons did a very good for his part. But those are two experienced actors that will give good performances regardless. The CG on Saphira was very well done. The main problem with the acting in this movie was Edward Speleers, he had no presence in this movie, which is a bad thing for the main character. It was all most like he was just there to read his lines and go home. For which I hold the director responsible but it was also one of his first movies. I think Edward would have made a good side character, but someone with more experienced should have been casted as Eragon or a director with more proved talent. If you have never read the book and enjoy good CG you will like this movie. Just change the name of the movie to Saphira and it is OK. If you have read the book assume it is a coincidence that the movie and characters share names.",Eragon
1050,seaangel569,I was extremely disappointed!,1,20 December 2006,"I love the Inheritance series, but the movie didn't come close. It was done badly. To many key parts were cut out,the ""Razack"" look like something out of a horror movie, the ""urgals"" just look like large men, i didn't even know there were dwarfs until someone told me; the twins, Solembum, and Katrina weren't even mentioned. It just wasn't done to it's full potential. I think it was lame and corny. ex: ""I'm a princess"", ""When will i see you again?"" And the ending was all wrong. It was just bad in my opinion. My suggestion is to just stick with the books, they are so much, well, more. More complex and the characters are more developed, and the story is fuller. There is more to it than the movie shows. I hope the Eragon is redone in the near future and is done better, and it would be great if the characters look how the are described in the book.For example Aray's looks don't fit her personality, which was also changed.",Eragon

Opps...I will say at least the movie didn't make the storyline seem too much like Star Wars... Then again, even the changes from the book doesn't change that fact...Farmboy being raised by uncle runs away with old wise man after uncle gets killed and gets magic sword and I'm not even gonna go into the father thread... See it's Star Wars...",Eragon
1052,jeggo182,Horrible,1,20 December 2006,"This is one of the worst book to movie I have ever seen. Not surprising though as the screenplay was written by the same guy who wrote the screenplay for the travesty that was Jurassic Park 3. I mean did he even read the book? The movie is like a horrible version of Eragon on crack. They go from Daret (which was stupidly shown) to the foothills of the Beor Mountains in what is depicted in like a day. Then when Durza makes Arya tell Eragon where she was he and Saphira fly to Gil'ead in another day. Where were the plains? The desert? or any of the other multitude of things left out? The movie was so jumpy and wrong it made me want to leave the theater. The characters were OK but there was only two races, humans and dragons. Elves? no. Urgals? no. Dwarfs? no. I discounted the Razaac because they were so hideously incorrect. Farthen Dur understandably would have been hard to reproduce, but how they made it was stupid. All in all I say is don't watch and we should start a petition to get Peter Jackson to remake it because you know if he is the director it will actually have different races.",Eragon
1053,gwanunig,Place the blame where it belongs,1,20 December 2006,"No one is placing the blame for this crap where it belongs. Yes, the writing sucked, Saphira wasn't a dragon, Arya wasn't an elf, dwarfs didn't exist, etc. But everyone complains about how it was an affront to Paolini's books. But really it's all his fault. He was originally offered a consulting position(translation: god of the film) and he said no. The real problem with this movie is that the author didn't care enough about the film to help with it. Idiot. Has he ever seen what happens in Hollywood when the author doesn't have a say (exception: LOTR). In summary, the director, writers, and producers deserve some blame (none on the actors, they did what they could with what they had) but we should mainly place blame on Paolini rather than offer him our sympathy.",Eragon
1054,horse_lover122,each to their own,10,20 December 2006,"I have loved the books ever since I read the first page of the first book. And I have to say that I am incredibly disappointed that most people thought so poorly of the movie, because then maybe it turn them off the book. I can't say I was thrilled with the way a lot of scenes and characters were cut out, or the fact that everything was so rushed, and the characters that were included only had about 5-15 lines each. But overall, despite how badly I think this movie was stuffed up, I do love it and I intend on buying it when it comes out on video.It really is an each-to-your-own kind of movie, because if you read the book first you will probably be disappointed in the movie, depending on how critical you are, but if you watch the movie first you will be incredibly confused. But it is worth the money to watch it, and as for the comments about being a Harry Potter-Lord Of The Rings-Star Wars rip-off, so what? People are acting way too critically and are not having open minds about it. Eragon was written by a fifteen year old boy! I'd call that a pretty big achievement.Overall, it is worth the money to at least watch it once, and I hope they decide to turn Eldest into a movie for the sake of winning back some respect for the books and Eragon movie.",Eragon
1055,jlorrig,Great Family Movie!,10,20 December 2006,"Okay, so I'm a sap for good old fashioned hero tails, but regardless Eragon was a good movie. You hate the villains and love the heroes.If you are looking for a twist that will shock, a slow paced romance, or a gory war film then look elsewhere.The film's tagline, ""You are stronger than you realize. Wiser than you know. What was once your life is now your legend."" just scratches the surface of story. It is the classic telling of a young hero's struggle with destiny and, simply, growing up. He is not Spiderman or Bateman looking for himself. Rather he knew who he was and was fine with that, then his whole life is turned upside down. It is reminiscent of Lord of the Rings with the idea of a reluctant hero who is called on to do great things. In the process he has lots to learn (esp. curbing his pride).All told the movie left me inspired to take on the villains of life remembering that sometimes it's just ""one part brave, three parts fool"" that will pull me through.",Eragon
1056,Baruchz-1,Less than satisfying,4,21 December 2006,"If you've read the book Eragon, expect to leave the movie wondering just how much they paid Christopher Paolini for the rights to butcher his story.The effects are pretty good, but to be honest, the film left me with the impression that the point was to crank it out as quick as they could, and not to produce a decent adaptation of the story. At about an hour and a half, they've cut so much from the book that the film seems less than satisfying. With an additional fifteen minutes to half hour, they would have kept the length of the film reasonable still, and had enough time to present some of the parallel plots Paolini has running in his manuscript.In addition, the film compresses the time frame of the story to such a short time that they had to pull some off-the-wall ideas to keep up. For instance, unlike the book where the dragon is cared for by the title character as she grows up, the film has a quick scene where the small dragon, ready for her first flight, is launched by Eragon into the air. In this first flight, she undergoes a magical transformation from small juvenile dragon to very large adolescent dragon.I'm a parent, and I know our children seem to grow up so fast, but that was just ridiculous.The film also barely gives a nod to the martial training the title character receives. He is shown as being barely adequate in one sparring match with his new-found mentor, and no further training in either combat or magic is shown. Yet, later in the film (and only a short span of supposed real time later), he is competent enough in both to dispatch an opponent with many years of training and experience. It would have taken maybe a thirty second montage of cut scenes, flashing on sequential training sessions to convey the idea of long-term instruction, as well as giving the dragon the additional time to grow and mature; yet the film makers chose a rather poor shortcut.Incidentally, Paolini did not shortcut any of this in his book.As films go, it was entertaining and enjoyable enough, but I'm sure it would have been more so if I had not read the book first. I think, too, the makers of Eragon could take some lessons from Peter Jackson in how to abridge a story so as to make it fit a normal movie, while still retaining the essential points valuable to the plot.We discussed whether we would bother buying the DVD when it releases. My only attraction to it would be if there is a ""Director's Cut"" that might just fill in some of the holes left by this movie. Even then, it's debatable whether I'll bother.",Eragon

The actors were great, cinematography and special effects were great, I blame the producer and director, the movie should have been at least two hours long to provide better character development and storyline, the books had all the material needed to make it an epic movie. There should have been more time spent on Eragon and the dragon when it was not full grown, Eragon and his cousin Roran, Eragon and Brom, the movie was moving too fast.

Thank goodness my chair had a drink-holder otherwise I might have ruined the carpet. Excuse me but did someone drop the story in a shredder? Turned it on and poured the snippets on a film roll?? What happened to the story? Will there be a special ""Extended Version""? Something like ""Directors cut""? Did we all just see a 90 minutes trailer of a greater film? I hope so because what I had seen was a senseless puzzle of Eragon scenes. Another riddle: Did the film crew put 90% of the budget into the development of the dragon? The dragon was awesome but the rest... only disappointing. I asked my friends if they have recognized the protagonists (besides Eragon and Arya): Galbatorix, Ajihad, Murtagh, Angela ... but they asked me, if they are of any relevance for the story. So much for a story. Where did all the dwarfs go?

This could of been a great movie that I would have seen with my kids several times and bought when it came out on DVD. Now, you can keep it.

1060,vishwajeetcanada,Awesome.,10,21 December 2006,"I disagree with some comments, if not all, by billkubert. First off all, i would like to point out the fact that if a movie stretches the mile of a novel, it would end up being a 5 hr minimum movie. And keeping that in mind, we can't expect the movie to cover every single detail presented in the book. The story does not wander from the novel, it skips out on some critical details that weren't specifically needed. It wasn't high school level as well, I felt the emotions of the characters of how the actors portrayed them. It was clear, impulsive and very empowering. The sets clearly suit what the novel wanted and how it should be set at that time. And once in a while, you should stop comparing movies to books, even though it has originated from a book. I mean take LOTR (Lord of the rings), it skipped a lot of details from the book, it had a similar set - guess what it turned to, a masterpiece. Eragon, the movie, is amazing. Compared to the book, yes it lacks much, but which movie doesn't. And I am waiting for the sequel desperately, and yes it will rock when all the trilogy is out.",Eragon

This being said, I have no clue how the heck it lasted that long as the movie started at 5:00 and I was out of the theater at 6:25, but maybe my theater had to cut some out because it ripped. But, anyways, when the movies was over and the lights slowly came on, I stood shocked in my seat. Not because the movies was good, but because of how short it was! I kept repeating, ""I can't believe it's already over."" I couldn't believe I had paid eight bucks for THAT!What really disappointed me is that there was so much potential. They left out important scenes and because of that would definitely not be able to pull together a decent sequel.The acting wasn't BAD, but it was under par. I saw the ratings, but I had faith.

Also, the Urgals were not what I expected, there were no dwarfs, and Jeod was completely left out. The two characters I was most disappointed by were Galbatorix- he didn't strike me as particularly menacing- and Arya.

I hope that someone else picks up the movie rights and re makes this and that this director does not do the sequel, ( if there is one after the poor quality of this one). If you have not read this book, do so. Or listen to it on audio. You will not believe it is the same story!!!",Eragon

So, I go to the local theater and watch a movie that can only be described as pathetic. It was like watching someone with a speech impediment tell a story. I felt sorry for the people in the audience who hadn't read the book, they had no idea what was going on. Hell, I'm not to sure I knew what was going on. I left the theater feeling as though the director and screen writer were laughing at me for spending the money and time see this excuse for a movie.Since when did Saphia have feathers? OK, I can forgive the feathers but NOT the poor writing. The guy (or guys) who wrote this screen play should be banned from ever doing another film.Save your money and buy the book.Jim",Eragon

Sorry about that.A lot of people say that it looks like lord of the rings but i am not agree whit that. It is a story like that but is a totally different story en it's a good story. The special effects are awesome and the story is very good too. Everybody is different i know that, but i find the movie very good serious. What was great too is the magic between Eragon and his dragon. The part that he heals his dying dragon was a great part in the movie and especially the fight that the dragon uses his fire and when that wizard was defeated.

1076,nelgallan,Eragon...the cliff notes,4,22 December 2006,"The screenwriters and director of this film seem to think if everyone has read the book they don't need to do any kind of basic story telling. They have created a visual cliff note of the story. I love the science fantasy genre, and have sat through some horrible adaptations, but this may be the worst. I am seriously disappointed by work on the film. Christoper Paolini, if he has any pride in his work, will either insure that no one who had anything to do with picture works on the sequel, or he will refuse to allow a sequel. The acting was for the most part forced and wooden, the story line (what there was) was jumpy, and the special effects uninspired.",Eragon
1077,kay_k13,Good Movie. Bad book-based movie,5,22 December 2006,"Halfway through watching this film I screamed ""Did they even read the book when they made this?!"" This terrified the man sitting next to me, but I had good reason to say this.This movie barely follows the book at all. They could write a completely separate book with what they did in the movie. The movie was too rushed. Too many facts were changed (Brom's death, Eragon's age, etc.). Many important characters were turned into minor characters for the film. Solembum was completely wiped out of the movie, and he pretty much tells Eragon everything. Arya was supposed to be unconscious until the very end, but she seemed very awake throughout the movie to me.I must admit, though, the acting and special effects were good. But if a person were to see the movie and had not read the book, they would miss out on some very important information to completely understand the film.The movie itself was alright. But if you are a fan of the book looking forward to see the movie, you will probably be very disappointed. Don't waste your money.",Eragon
1078,johnfrost_76,From bad to worse to downright lazy,1,22 December 2006,"Having read the book which I thought was an enjoyable if rather unoriginal venture into the fantasy adventure genre (elves and dwarfs aren't mandatory y'know! Try not to be quite such a carbon copy of Tolkein), I decided to go see the film in the hopes that it could add a new dimension to the story. Boy, was I wrong.I knew I was in trouble in the first 5 mins with the completely inaccurate description of the Dragon Riders' downfall. I held out hope that the likes of Jeremy Irons and John Malkovich would deliver their usual flawless performances and save the film. Considering what they had to work with, hope was slim. Jeremy seemed rather bored most of the time, John overacted so badly I couldn't help but think it was his way of making up for having a supporting role. Robert Carlyle's portrayal of Durza was ridiculously pantomimey, coming off as just plain creepy rather than scary and dark.Add to this Plot holes big enough to fit the titanic, a two dimensional lead performance, missing and/or defiled characters, and a lacklustre script. And that's putting it mildly.What happened to Arya being an elf? What happened to Saphira being given her name by Eragon? Who cast the twenty-something Joss Stone as the middle-aged herbalist Angela? Where were the dwarfs? Were those Urgals, or just extras from 'Last of the Mohicans' who wandered into the wrong sound stage by mistake? And above all, what happened to the ENTIRE PLOT from the moment they reach Farthen Dur?? The list of such questions goes on.The whole thing was rushed and hap-hazardly strung together. They should've spent some time and a bit of effort, and made a good 3 hour movie (see Lord of the Rings) instead of a bad 90 minute one. The only reason I could think of for Christopher Paolini allowing this travesty to reach cinemas is that they threw a truck load of money at him. The sfx were slick, but you think they could've at least found money in the budget to give Arya a pair of pointy ears! Not even Rachel Weisz's admittedly solid performance as Saphira leant any credibility to this movie.Anyone remember 2000's Dungeons & Dragons? No, I didn't either. Until I saw Eragon. THAT's how bad it was. Mr Paolini, Hollywood has bent you over, pulled your pants down, and punched your donut good. Shame on you! My advice to anyone planning to see this movie - skip it and rent Lord of the Rings again. Or, wait until Eragon is out on DVD, buy it and use the disc as a novelty coaster. Your money will be better spent that way.Still, one good thing has come of this - I now view the book with a renewed appreciation. In fact I may have to read it again simply to wipe this train wreck of a movie from my memory.**To those people who keep saying 'its a only a children's book' I disagree. Paolini wrote it when he was fifteen, and it is aimed at people of that age and upwards. There is nothing childish about the way the book is written (and some of the scenes are certainly graphic enough to EXCLUDE younger children) so there is no excuse for the film's short-comings to be reasoned away with 'well, its only a kids movie'**PS. What's with the comically homoerotic wrestling scene between Eragon and Roran? Bizarre.",Eragon
1079,iceqt314,not nearly as good as the novel.,4,22 December 2006,"The book ""Eragon"" surprised many fiction sci-fi readers. As a young author with such an imagination and talent for capturing an audience continually, even after two or three readings, Paolini was just what the American community needed. The book had so much potential to be a ground-breaking movie. Its cinema debut, however, was very disappointing. It skipped over many important parts of the novel- if you hadn't read the book, you probably would not have been able to follow along. The voice of Saphira, Rachel Weisz, was fantastic- the part was well written and she delivered perfectly. Other than that, however, the acting left something to be desired. Many characters did not match their descriptions in the movie. Either they looked different than expected, or their personalities were not portrayed as they were in the book. The location shots were gorgeous, but unfortunately could not make up for the poor writing.Fans of the book should be forewarned- don't expect to be pleased.",Eragon

I've been looking forward to see it since this summer and now, I'm quite disappointed. It was so... 'dry'. Really, I don't know how to call it properly... it didn't make me cry... it didn't make me laugh or be happy... it was simply without feelings. And there were parts which I bet I wouldn't have understood if I hadn't read the book, which just made you live at the same time with the characters, it was so full of life and fascinating! But the film... I expected it to be as great as The Lord of the Rings, because it's very much like it. But I can't even compare them! What I liked is the way they created the... SF creatures and objects... Saphira looked great! As for the disappointment, I can't blame the actors, they did their job, but the plot was poor, it didn't give all the necessary information for the second film. For example... where's Karina? She didn't appear at all in the movie and she has a very important role in the second one! And besides, you could say that her father was quite kind with Eragon, at the beginning, which is COMPLETELY opposite in the book. And Brom's death was totally disappointing... I thought it would make me cry, it would impress me... but no... it just came and passed quickly. And, finally, WHERE ON EARTH IS TOGIRA IKONOKA? He is extremely important! Anyway... I would recommend everyone who likes science-fiction the book ERAGON and ERAGON 2, as well. They are really worth-reading.

However, I am NOT looking forward to the next movie in the series. I doubt that another movie will even be made after the creation of the debacle I went to see last night.The screenwriter for this film should have actually read the books before he turned ""Eragon"" into a movie. I can't believe Christopher Paolini signed off on this film! It wasn't even made clear that there were three races of people living in Alagaesia. I had to tell my wife, who hasn't read the books, that Arya was an elf! The costumes, camera work, and the special effects were not even that good! The Urgals just looked like humans with bad makeup jobs. During one of the panoramic shots, I swear I saw a ""modern-day"" road in the background. Saphira looked good, but obviously the budget for this film was too small to do justice to the magic and mystery portrayed by Paolini.Please Christopher Paolini, if they come to you for another movie demand drastic changes!

In other words the cheapest looking fantasy that i seen in the last few years, suitable for TV, maybe, but not for the big screen.

I read Eragon, I read Eldest, and then I found out that they were going to turn Eragon into a movie. I was very excited, watching the trailer for it and everything...The first time I saw it, I was amazed by how good the movie was. The more I watched it, the more I saw its flaws (which stand out like a bruise after being whacked in the face with a hot frying pan).Sure, the acting was good...Sort of. Okay, average. Less than average. Saphira was excellent as was Murtagh, in my opinion. Brom was awesome. They need to recast Eragon and Arya for different people in my opinion. It's just...not right. Arya doesn't even have the right hair color. And Eragon...not how I pictured (it never is, though, so I guess we're stuck with Ed). How everything looked was fine, the landscapes were awesome, and I loved the way baby Saphira looked. As an adult dragon, no. It was just...bad. Her wings were hardly what we would call ""dragon"" wings. It was as if someone ripped of a Dove's wings and taped them to her back and died them blue. Saphira isn't supposed to look cute, she's supposed to look beautiful and elegant AND deadly! Also her blue should've been darker. But that's getting very picky.Onto the flaws. Well, obviously they didn't put the entire book into the movie--I didn't expect that to happen anyway. But...God they left out some important stuff. Arya and all other elves were completely ruined. Saphira was randomly flying and suddenly morphs into a full-grown dragon. NO, that's not how it works. They could at least gone like ""a few months later"" or something, or even shown a few scenes, in which it would show Saphira growing. I was insulted watching Saphira just suddenly morph into a dragon. I realize making a film is pricey, but god, couldn't even afford to have a dragon grow up the right way? Had to fast-forward through everything?ALL IN ALL: The movie was rushed, the acting was less-than-average (Brom, Saphira, Murtagh: only good ones), it left out FAR too much (compared to today's movies...Dark Knight was an hour and a half long, they couldn't afford to make one that long?), and there were TOO MANY MISTAKES.In my opinion they should erase this movie from the records so all the fans can live in peace.",Eragon

The lead was raw and young, the baddies scary as hell and the flying dragon scenes very well done - complaints about bad acting or scripts would have fallen on deaf ears for us. I enjoyed it too - it was no LOTR but still a decent piece of fantasy.

The book had emotion, relationships, the trust of one another, a journey that developed the characters mentally and physically, and none of this is seen in this movie. It's just another movie made to earn some quick money. The director in my eyes is a complete idiot who never even read the book. He made another brainless movie which is so bluntly obvious that a baby could foreshadow the story line and characters.I not even mentioning that he skipped 70% of the story line and then pulled an ending out of his ass,and this is nothing compared to what he did to the characters. The protagonist doesn't need to look evil. He's the king and I think that he should be seen as a king and not some kind of a monster, even though he is the protagonist. In the movie he lives in some basement and there is some kind of an evil theme song thing going on every time he is on which in my opinion is stupid.What I'm saying is that you should not even bother to go see the movie; instead, do yourself a favor, and go to a local book store and get yourself a book. And for the director of the movie Stefen Fangmeier, and the co-writer Peter Buchman, or whoever was in charge of creating this monstrosity?

These do a fantastic job with adapting great children's books and make no mistake Eragon is a great children's book. That is why this film was such a major disappointment. For starters the lead character might as well have been a cardboard cutout. He literally had only one facial expression and I don't think he even had a line in the film till about the 15th minute. Secondly this movie has terrible dialog and equally terrible acting. Paolini should be ashamed that he let this film become what it is. An extended commercial for ILM and nothing more. Critics have compared this film to Star Wars but that is an insult to Star Wars. How dare them compare this tripe to the greatest trilogy of our time? Finally and most importantly is the sense of knowing that this film could have been something special. The books are filled with memorable characters and harrowing action. This film eliminates almost all of those things and leaves an empty shell of crap. I literally left the theater sick and I know a lot of other people did as well.

It seems as if the editor couldn't differentiate between what went on the floor and what stayed on the roll. As a result, Eragon is filled with lackluster scene cuts and sub-par acting. Also, one will be hard-pressed at determining the amount of time that elapses between the opening scene and the last.

Basically, they have to continue the trilogy, so they had to start somewhere. In the beginning, the true outline of the story is a bit muddled, but becomes clearer as the movie progresses. Near the middle of the film is when the puzzle pieces really start to come together and form the whole picture, but there are still some pieces that are missing, and remain missing for the length of the film. And although the movie has some major differences from the book, you will almost never find an exact realization from book to film, due to time and money constraints.

1093,BarkleyVader,Where's the Wookiee?,2,24 December 2006,"The Eragon book was okay considering the fact it was written by a teenager. But when I read it I noticed it had some contradictions, some things that you could tell were from the fantasy of a lonely teenager (for example, Arya was a vegetarian, yet she wore tight leather to seduce people, was ""beautiful"", and also discriminated against the dwarfs based on religion, etc, etc you could almost tell she was the brain-spawn of a single teenager who wished for such a fantasy) and its plot was identical to that of Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope. I expected that Hollywood would fix these problems, yet I noticed that only the Arya-snoot problem was fixed. The acting was bad, and the plot was equal to that of the book: Mediocre.No, the acting was horrible and the plot stunk. I don't think it was the actors' fault, but rather the script and the book it was based on. They obviously had a hard time with it, you could tell. The Special Effects were good, and the dragon was indeed the best character, which isn't saying much.So basically, a plot summary of both Eragon and Star Wars: ""A farm boy *Luke Skywalker/Eragon* raised by his uncle *Uncle Owen/Garrow* finds a mysterious artifact *Droids/Dragon Egg* that changes his life. His uncle is killed by the enemy's henchmen *Stormtroopers/Ra'Zac*. He is then put under the training of a wise old hermit *Obi-Wan Kenobi/Brom* (who is secretly part of the order that the farm boy is training to resurrect *Jedi Order/Dragon Riders*) who teaches him how to use a magical force *The Force/Magic*. They travel to the base of the rebels *Yavin IV/Farthen Dur* opposing an evil empire ruled by an evil tyrant *Palpatine/Galbatorix* who seeks to destroy the rebellion *Rebel Alliance/Varden* and the new threat, but along the way the mentor is killed by an elite member of the enemy forces *Darth Vader/Durza*. He continues his journey with a beautiful woman *Princess Leia/Arya* and a rogue *Han Solo/Murtagh* with a secret past. The entire thing eventually climaxes into a battle for the safety of the rebellion *Battle Against the Death Star/Battle of Farthen-Dur* and the rebels win, taking with them one of the king's sidekicks *Grand Moff Tarkin/Durza*. A new hope rises for the rebellion as they challenge the empire!"" Only die-hard fans will find the movie appeasing, and only little children who have never seen the original star wars trilogy will find it original. The one thing I didn't see in the movie was a Wookiee, which was a shame.So really, make it your choice if you want to see a poorly slapped together piece of work combining Lord of the Rings with Star Wars, with horrible acting (at no fault of the actors).I don't blame the cast and crew for making this movie stink, but the original book which is obviously a Lord-Of-The-Rings Fan's version of Star Wars.One last thing: Galbatorix's name sounds like a shampoo bottle.",Eragon

What this director and screenplay writer did to the story was an injustice. They ripped out 85% of the book, blended the rest to their bad tastes and then inserted a really bad medieval version of Star Wars: Episode II. This should have been been a grand adventure of a boy and dragon fighting against untenable enemies, it should be the story of a boy and teacher, amazing cities, races colliding with each other in great battles. What instead was fed to us were mud-hole villages, every race mashed together into different badly dressed humans with grime as an excuse for real makeup, a storyline so badly butchered that the only thing it has in common with it's book are the names given to things and characters and a story that is so thin a baby's breath could rip it asunder. The writer and director were a sorry choice for a movie that could have been one of the top movies of the year, the only hope this movie has of ever having it's sequels were if the movie were rewritten and remade with a real director and writer this time.

I think you should watch the movie with an open mind and understand that it is the first of a trilogy so it cant very well have all the juice because what then will the sequels have?I also like the fact that it means anyone can have hope to do great things regardless of their status in life.

When you play with fire, you get burnt. Lucky for me that i saw it without losing money. It's not legal, i know, but if you really want to see the movie, don't go to the cinema.

1098,Blacksad0703,Awful movie,3,26 December 2006,"I just can't believe it but after I saw the movie I was sure I saw a lot of scenes before. Oh now I remember : This movie is just a copy of great films like Lord Of The Rings and Star Wars , but with less good special effects and actors. Only the dragon brought some good acting. Jeremy Irons died almost directly and the main character is just bad. I watched the movie in premiere because I've had won some free tickets to watch it. I'm glad I didn't had to pay for this movie. It looks to me that Fox just wanted to have a success like New Line cinema with the Lord of the Rings movies. I must say : bad luck for Fox. Maybe the more little girls will watch the movie for the pretty face of Ed Speleers. But more grown up watchers will notice that this movie really stinks.",Eragon
1099,jen_ro_hea1,what I thought about the movie,3,25 December 2006,"Personally I thought the special effects were pretty good, and how they made the dragon was cool. That and the people who played Saphira and Brom were really good. Other than that I think that the movie was pretty bad because the filmmakers did not do the people right, such as Arya; she should have had black hair, and where were the two bald men? So characters were missing from the movie, and so were a lot of the main events. Such as Eragon learning to read, the were cat, talking with the dwarf king, the oil spilling on the Urgals in the last battle, the pile of bodies in the one town, training on the field while in the Varden, the pain Eragon went through with Durza'a wound and the elf, and Eragon talking to Brom and learning about dragons. A lot of the events were also messed up, Eragon was supposed to ask Saphira which names she liked, the battle with Durza, Eragon getting hurt and staying in town and then running off and gathering supplies. The costumes were also off; Arya was supposed to have black hair and pointed ears, Durza was supposed to have maroon eyes, the Urgals needed horns, the Raazacs were supposed to have beaks and big capes and they were supposed to ride the evil horses. I could go on and on, but I will end by saying that this movie NEEDS Desperately to be REMADE with people who actually know about the book. And it wouldn't be hard because the movie would probably end up being the length of one of the Lord of the Rings movies (which I think is fun because you can really get into the movie).",Eragon
1100,piperp39004,great movie,8,25 December 2006,"I, on the whole, though it was a great movie. The actors weren't the best, but they were good enough for those of us who go to watch the movie, not dissect it and judge every little detail. I'm very glad that they did not pick some of the actors that they were thinking of using, they are too popular and thought of as characters from other epic series, they could never be viewed as new characters, characters in this movie. It wasn't three hours long, and I've seen the book, it's huge, there is no way that they could have fit the whole book in two hours, they put the parts that they viewed as important, writers, directors, producers, and the author of the book often work on this together for movies like this, so it isn't all the writers, directors, and producers' fault, the author was in on it too, it's their book, they know the most about it, they can be the best judge as to what is important.No, I have not read the books, but that doesn't mean that the rest of you who have read the books get to completely disregard my opinion. I live in a house where we love epic movies like this, and we tend to dissect the movies, and judge them by the books, so i know how you feel, but I am telling you what I tell my family when I think they are taking it overboard.",Eragon
1101,mnmus-1,"A- for CGI, D+ for plotting/characterization/dialog",4,26 December 2006,"Gorgeous scenery. Very well-done (if derivative--think ""Dragonheart"" and look at the dragon's face) CGI with Saphira. The sets were all from some weak, poorly-thought-out Medieval imagery. Extremely ""rich"" clothing for a poor farm boy (finely machine-sewn, richly-tanned leathers with extravagantly expensive--for the setting--fasteners, for example). *heh* Simple things broke suspension of disbelief, like Eragon and his cousin simply tossing what would be relatively expensive farm implements on the ground and walking off. Multiple continuity issues, beginning, in my memory, with Eragon nocking an arrow in one scene, followed immediately with him--not yet having loosed the arrow at the deer he was stalking--drawing an arrow from his quiver in the next view of the same scene.Little things like that abounded.But those kinds of things, while annoying, paled in comparison to the overall failures of the film. OK, granted the characters in the book were a little cookie-cutter, stereotypical for the genre. The book is, after all, a first novel by a talented adolescent boy. But the characters in the movie were even less three dimensional than in the book, more cardboard cutouts than anything else. Would it be too much for Stefen Fangmeier to ask his actors to, well, act? (Heck, in the book, not even the Urgals (sp?) were completely stereotypical and were MUCH more believable, even almost sympathetic creatures at times--but then, Paolini gave them dialog, a history and a culture... ). And the massive cuts in the story from book to movie delete what logical progression in character development and interactions there were in the book.Paolini's book was readable because, for all its faults, it told a story in a way that drove me to finish it. And enjoy it along the way. Its faults were easily forgivable because it was a decent story, told with heart. The film had all the book's faults with nothing in the way of plotting, character development or dialog to redeem those faults. SPOILER (?): For example the silliness of _changing_ plot elements unnecessarily while cutting useful plot elements is baffling. Why delete the cousin's marriage and substitute his departure (for some vague destination) to avoid being pressed into military service? To demonize the evil king? Unnecessary, except as a device to get the cousin out of the movie in a way that would further vitiate Eragon's character development (read the book to understand that cryptic reference :-)). Just purely dumb.The time compression is poorly done throughout, as well. (Just compare Saphira's ""maturation"" in the movie to the book, for example.) Transitions between scenes, even those covering a couple of years in the book (and in the movie, although we are subtly encouraged to ignore the fact that Eragon is fifteen at the beginning and seventeen at the end--even as stated in the movie!), are choppy, with little logical connection at times.And why leave the fortune teller scene in at all and cut most of the fortune out? The scene is a pivot point in the book--and significant in the next book, ""Eldest,"" yet there's nothing worth seeing in what's left of it in the film.Baffling incompetence, unless the intent was to make the film less good.But it did have very well-done action scenes, fun flying scenes (although I could easily have done without some of the silly--to me--sound effects) and, as I have said, very well-done CGI and the outdoor scenes were beautiful. The music was very well-done, even though at times I wish someone had strangled the sound editor in his crib cos it sometimes obscured dialog. The cast was well-chosen for the most part (but very poorly directed, IMO, especially with the poorly-written script they were given to work with), and the _potential_ for some good chemistry was there, though sadly not made much use of by the director or the actors themselves.The book was MOR derivative sword and sorcery genre, but very readable, even prompting me to read the sequel. And the sequel was better-written, so I'll probably read the next book, as well. But while this movie was worth seeing at the $4.00 matinée price I paid, and enjoyable for th action scenes, the outdoor ""scenery"" and the CGI, I doubt I will see the next one if it's filmed by the same people.Not bad, but the book's a much better value for your buck.",Eragon
1102,kiaraluvssara,better then the book,7,26 December 2006,i have 2 say that the movie was better then the book. the language the author used in the story doesn't fit. the book was supposed 2 b mystical but the author sounds like he was writing and just looked up a bunch of words in the dictionary. it was really clumsily composed. the movie was OK. it probably could have been longer.but other then that it was fairly enjoyable. the story lines sort of the same as the book although there are a lot of differences. i don't blame them for changing it though.i just hope that the sequel is more satisfying. i haven't read that book yet but it should b good from what iv heard.,Eragon
1103,bungiewolf,Bad,1,8 January 2007,"This movie was bad. I knew it wasn't close to the books as I was about to watch it, so I watched it like I had never heard of it before. Everything was good until one scene. Saphira flew into the sky and came back full grown in a matter of seconds. It is like she grew up and Eragon stayed the same age. From then on, it got worse. The urgals often popped up unexplained, and the lady who told prophecies was really stupid. The urgals were just big fat guys with swords. The effects were amazing, but many characters were left undeveloped and unexplained, such as Murtagh, Brom, and the elf. She didn't even have pointy ears! That's all I have to say.",Eragon
1104,mkrakau,Eragon........ *shrug*,6,26 December 2006,"Eragon gets 6 of ten on sheer casting and special effects. But the story line itself is deeply predictable. Don't get me wrong - it like a romantic comedy - you know how it'll wind up and you're relatively glad but it takes ALL the struggle out of it. And since this is a ""coming of age"" in fantasy scale, the lack of real struggle makes it a better painting than a movie.Its truly a pity. Eragon's VERY pretty to look at, and easy on the emotions. The cast are busting their, extremely able, teeth to put SOME drama into it but the direction and script simply don't allow it. The lead male is just about the only exception - he's very good looking....... and thats about it.Mac",Eragon

It will sit on the top of the list with ""Gili"" and ""Justin and Kelly"" as one of the worst movies of all time to ever hit a theater screen. The directing in general was the worst I'd ever seen. The way the camera was used just didn't work. Stefen F did the worst job of making a film and the best job of screwing up a great book series! There were slow motion dramatic shots when they weren't needed. The movie had WAAAAAY too many clichés and corny phrases. The books were a real good read, do not get me wrong, but the movie was the worst I'd seen in almost a decade! DO NOT see this movie! It is worth neither your time nor money!",Eragon

The other characters were also portrayed really well. To the IMAGINATIVE the film is excellent. I feel so sorry for Ed at that comment, hes an excellent young actor.

Overall it's an interesting popcorn movie and the girls will love it much more than the original star wars series. Young heroes, riding on the backs of dragons seem to be much more popular than riding in spaceships 30 years ago. Let's see what the future brings in part 2... and who will be Yoda!

In the movie, my friends were upset that it didn't turn out the way they intended when they saw the previews for it. I wish that the movie involved the scenes that led up to the most important parts. The actors were very believable as the characters in my opinion. Murtagh, my favorite character, played by Garrett Hedlund made a good performance as a secretive character.

Arya isn't an elf in the movie and Hrothgar is the tallest dwarf i have ever seen. Villages and characters were changed at will - which totally changed the story.

The Beor Mountains have over ten miles high, I don't have seen nothing like that in this movie.

Where were the bald twins? Why does Brom reveal secrets that aren't even stated until the second book? Where was the author of the book on this movie and why did he let them destroy his plot?

I believe that the part where Saphira just flies off into a cloud, and comes down fully grown was the part where the movie really took a turn for complete and utter turmoil. and if you haven't read the book, i'm sorry, but this movie will never make any sense to you, you will feel as if you're watching a clip in fast forward and that this movie is an utter waste of your time and your money. If you read the book, then I'm even more sorry, because you know how terrible this movie is, and what a perversion it is of such a wonderful book. You will also note that it seems that they took what seems to be a young adult book, to me, and turn it into a movie for 6 year olds, with all of the corny lines, and cliché's of a movie, and took out all of the good scenes, shortened the battle, destroyed the fight between eragon and durza, and totally murdered the entire plot.

I absolutely love the books, they are on a parallel with the Lord of the Rings books and should have been set for a great transformation from book to film. However the film makers and script writers have destroyed what could have been an epic film. So much has been left out of the book which is critical to the characters and plot later on in the second book. I shan't go into too much detail but all that read this should focus on reading the book and not see the film. I cannot believe Christopher Paolini agreed on this as a good interpretation of his book. It has spoilt any chances of turning a fantastic trilogy into one to remember. So in summary I would strongly recommend reading the books, however if you want to be hugely let down, then go and see the film! How they can put what should be a 3 hour epic into an hour and a half is beyond any sense! If I had to be nice about it, I suppose the graphics and CGI were good, but it rushed between scenes, missed so much out, missed out characters, events, and so much more. The actors didn't have a chance to excel as the script was equally poor. NOT GOOD CHRISTOPHER. Its almost worth scrapping this film and starting again!",Eragon

Maybe if it had been done in 2 parts, all the things that were left out could have been included. I missed Saphira's growing up and Eragon's training with Brom, I think not enough time was spent on those. Really, most of the things that I thought the film lacked were due to the time limitation - this deserved to be a longer film. Even the younger children who were in the audience were spellbound, and would have happily sat through another half hour or even more. Other than that, Saphira is very convincing, and many special effects give a feeling of true otherworldly magic.

Frankly its unfair to the actors to hold them to a standard that does not apply to this genre. Take the LOTR films for instance: the acting was certainly no better, and yet they were heralded as amazing movies. This is a fantasy film, folks, not Shakespeare.

1119,juli_jenkins,Don't Bother!!,2,27 December 2006,"As a fan of the Inheritance books, I was so excited to hear that a theatrical production was being release for Eragon. Apparently, I must have been spoiled by the attention to detail other franchises have paid to their literary source material (Harry Potter, Lord of the Rings, et al). I assumed that since the studios had seen what type of returns they get when they stick to the book that they would do Eragon justice... I was woefully wrong. Frankly, Peter Buchman is a hack of a screenwriter who only kept the names and a few plot points from the book. This film will only serve to anger and incite venom from any true fans of the Inheritance books. Furthermore, I'm a little disappointed in Christopher Paolini for allowing his work to be so horribly butchered. I can't believe that any author would agree to letting their work be so completely eviscerated and left hollow and devoid of any substance. The screenplay moves so quickly that there is no room for character or plot development between the special effects and battle scenes. Not to mention that it becomes apparent early on that they used far too much of their budget on the ""A-list"" talent (who rarely delivered) instead of on sets. Leaving the grandeur of Mr. Paolini's vision for Farthen Dur and Tronjheim flat and disappointing. Do not waste your time or money on this film.

Murtagh was not willing to go to the Varden, however, in the movie, he showed the way. He told Eragon his history before they got there in the book, but the movie had Eragon stupefied in the Dwarf city by the news. The movie was too short, losing continuity and flow at 99 minutes.

Not true to the book, mediocre acting, ho-hum production. It has a few moments and isn't terrible, but it's not particularly good, either. The Star Wars Light comment refers to the similarities between Luke and Eragon. It seemed like everything that happened to Eragon paralleled Star Wars too much. Luke was growing up with his uncle and so was Eragon. Luke's family was killed by the Emperor's minions and Eragon's uncle was killed by the King's. Luke had Alec Guiness as a mentor who dies shortly after his training is begins, Eragon had Jeremy Irons who dies shortly after his training begins. The Jedi were wiped out by a traitor; the Dragon Riders were wiped out by a traitor. Luke has the Force, Eragon has dragon-induced magic.

Nothing in the movie was what I expected from the book. The only decent part of the movie was the special effects used on Saphira.

What happened to the plot that I know and love? Gone. The movie was blasphemy to anyone who has ever read, and enjoyed, the book. The differences; Saphira aging, Angela, how Brom died, Arya's escape, how they met Murtagh, and the Varden's part in general. I was miffed to say the least. Throughout the movie anyone could hear me whispering heatedly 'That didn't happen!' or 'Not like that!'. I was so upset over what my favorite book had become that I didn't notice any of the good parts; the amazing flying scenes, Saphira, and the general quality of the acting. Speaking to my brother after the movie, I was complaining to him and he cut in saying that he quite enjoyed it. I decided to watch it again. I was surprised to find that once you gloss over the fact that MAJOR changes have been made; it's quite an enjoyable movie. If you haven't read the book, you'll enjoy it greatly, and if you have, like myself, the changes will nag at you like hell, but its a great movie to watch.",Eragon
1125,short_kid058,Do not watch this movie if you have read the book,1,28 December 2006,"If you read the book and watch the movie just like I did your in for a hell of a surprise. I wasted a good amount of money on this poor, rushed, money stealing film. I could not see how this had anything to do with the book. I have to say the acting was pretty sloppy and not suited for the actors. Rachel Weisz was the only one who gave a good performance with the voice for Saphira although it felt a bit awkward when Eragon talked back. None of the actors suited their roles of the characters. While watching this film it felt like watching a bunch of children pretending to be heroes.My attention to the film in the cinema was 0% i felt distracted and couldn't get pulled into the film like other films have. The movie was too fast paced and confusing which kept taking me out of the film. I really could not get into the characters or the setting. While watching the movie it felt like sitting in a chair with nails sticking out and a wet rubber glove smacking me in the face telling me to watch the movie.The story was probably the worst thing in this rubbish. I believe they left out about 400 pages of the book or more out of this. I never knew that Saphira could mature on her first flight and with 3 flashes of red lightning and be able to name herself and talk to Eragon through her mind in about 2 minutes. I also didn't know that Urgals are apparently big bald men with tattoos and don't have horns like they are supposed to have. I never knew that Arya could see the egg hatching or that Arya tells Eragon that she is a princess and she stays conscious through the whole film. Angela pops up as a chubby blonde with eye problems telling Eragon about his future for about a minute. Is it me or does Brom seem more excluded, lazy, scared, drunken and crazy in the film? Hes wise in some moments but he seems clumsy especially how he gets killed by Durza by jumping in front of Eragon using the cliché Hollywood body guard stunt and that doesn't even happen in the book. It's the Razac which kill him and they even get killed in this film!.The Razac also look like mummies spray painted black with maggots on their faces and from the back I seriously thought they were Predator. Ooo the sneaky Razac are running around with their knives oh my god watch out Eragon! Good job you killed him using a tree! wow Brom flies through the air and stabs the Razac, I'm so proud of you. Good work on getting killed by Durza later on. How did Ajihad know that Murtagh was Morzen's son as soon as he walked into the Varden? In the book their minds are being searched and Murtagh blocks out everything from his mind and is then locked up from suspicion. I laughed so hard because it was almost instant. Murtagh takes one step in. ""that is the son of Morzen!"" and then Murtagh says some queer lines about how no one chooses their fathers and some junk. I wonder why Saphira completely ruined the whole army in the battle by breathing fire everywhere.Durza summons some strange black dragon thing that you usually see in Final Fantasy and stuff. Surprisingly Eragon doesn't receive any injuries from Durza. The cut to his back doesn't happen and Arya coming to help him doesn't happen. It happened really fast I can't remember but amazingly Eragon jumps or something and stabs Durza in the Heart. Good on ya Mr Shade Slayer I don't think you read the book yet.When Roran leaves the farm Katrina isn't mentioned and his reason for leaving is because he doesn't want to get recruited in the army so this means that a huge part of the story is chopped out in 2 lines ""I'm at the age at which I get recruited in the army and i don't want to. I don't know where I'm going"". I think this movie needs writers not monkeys. Entire cities are left out of this film, the desert is left out of this film, Broms friend is left out of this film, around 10 characters, wait let me rephrase that 10,000 characters are left out of this film, dwarfs aren't in this film, the film is missing a proper director.Music is too dramatic and keeps changing again and again and again. sad, happy, triumphant, sad, happy, sad. For some reason some bits sound like Rambo guerrilla warfare music. The thing is the music didn't flow smoothly it just kept changing again and again it gets really annoying.At the moment i am seriously really disappointed with this film. I am so disappointed i couldn't stand it. If you haven't read the book go watch it. If you have do not watch! unless you also want to write a bad review for this film. I would call this the torture device not a film. Well there's too much to say about this movie and I can't be bothered because I'll end up writing a whole book on the things wrong with this movie.",Eragon
1126,sportsnut_ed,What was the screenwriter thinking?,5,28 December 2006,"I was so excited to see this movie because the books are very good. It was a very big let down. I just wonder what the screenwriter was thinking. Did he even read the book? The book, which isn't very big anyways, reads like a script for a movie. They should of let the author be the screenwriter because he has a better idea of how to portray the characters and the world of Alagaesia. This screenwriter is an unimaginative idiot! If there is to be a second movie I hope they let the author Christopher Paolini do the screenplay. Only he can save the trilogy. As for the acting, they did the best they could given the script they were handed. Eragon, at best, is a DVD rental.",Eragon
1127,vaderland69,Star Wars 'clone'?,7,28 December 2006,"I admit that I have not read the book, yet I did see the film with a friend who had. I will only say that she confirmed what I have been reading in this thread that the movie did not come close to the book at all.My opinion of the film was fair, I enjoyed it from the standpoint of someone who hadn't read it. But my criticism of the film is that the main plot seems to almost identically follow that of Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope.It starts off with a restless teenage orphaned boy living with his uncle, who just happens to have his destiny fall in his lap. A hermit outcast type(who was once a great warrior in the past as the movie later reveals albeit with very transpranet foreshadowing), befriends the young boy as his guardian/trainer (after the boy returns to find his uncle killed by the Antagonist forces), so that the boy may fulfill his destiny of learning his newly found powers while fighting in a resistance movement against an oppressive dark king/lord who was once a protector of the people (okay he was a dragon rider not a Galactic Senator) but became mad with power and removed his opposition.Any of this sound Familiar? Still, I did enjoy the film for the most part, Acting was done well and the formula works, even though it's been done a hundred times. The visuals were stunning, as were the costumes and sets.Not a must see but it's better than the last movie that Jeremy Irons did with Dragons in it. (for the n00bs: Dungeons and Dragons)",Eragon
1128,Tarsia,pretty good - needs some work,6,28 December 2006,"I was interested to see what they were able to do with the movie because I had really enjoyed the book. I agree that the screenplay could have been done better - there was quite a bit left out. I'm sure the budget for this movie was not what it was for ""Lord of the Rings""!I thought the casting was good - I like the fact that Eragon was played by a relative newcomer. And as always very good roles for both Jeremy Irons and John Malkovich.It would still be possible for a good screenwriter to fill in some of the missing background for a couple of the characters in the next movie.I'm hoping they will be able to write a tighter screenplay for part II (Eldest) - I for one am looking forward to it! I expect whether or not we see the sequel will depend on the ""box office"" for this film.",Eragon

Well, the film's production apparently was in the wrong hands! I have seen TV films that were better made! They destroyed the book and took too much liberty with the storyline! There is potential in the book for some beautiful scenes and dialog. My roommate saw the film with me without having read the book and he felt the movie a bit ""light"" and very, very childish. Nothing was fully explained or developed. The spirit of the book was non-existent in the film. Don't waste your time going to the cinema. I won't even waste my money on the DVD when there is one.",Eragon
1130,crystallineessence,"Boring, I was wondering the whole time when it was going to end....",1,28 December 2006,"I haven't read the book, but just from a movie-goer perspective, the whole thing was boring. I found myself wondering when the movie was going to finish after only twenty minutes, there was nothing new, interesting, or spectacular about it. The only halfway decent actor was just in the first half of the movie, and afterwards it became painful to watch as the teens struggled to deliver lines that were obviously written by a five-year-old - even Rachel Weiss failed to make the dialogue shine (not her fault, blame the horrible writers.) The best cast couldn't have made that screenplay come alive. The music was pretty dead too.The graphics were the best thing about the movie... but they don't hold up to anything like LOTR, or even Narnia or Harry Potter, since the only thing graphically ""interesting"" about the whole thing was the dragon's expressive face, and the light of the magic. Whoop-dee-doo.Do yourself a favor and wait to rent it. You're not missing anything.",Eragon
1131,godspaladin,There is not a word in the English language to explain my disgust,1,28 December 2006,"I just got back from seeing this movie. It is the worst book to movie transition that I have ever seen. I read the books and found them captivating. The movie on the other hand should be burned and never released on DVD. They should actually pick up the book and READ IT not just the cliff notes on it and try to make the movie again. I sincerely hope that the Author simply had no input in this movie or that anything that he said was either not taken as advice or decided to be taken in the exact opposite direction of what he intended.It simply was not the story from the book. It was butchered from the start and left me feeling sick to my stomach that people who had not read the book think that that is the story that was written. If that was how the book had been written I would have never finished the first book, eagerly read the second and been chomping at the bit for the third to come out.I will not be bothering to see the second or third movie of this trilogy as they will only serve to destroy the beauty of the word that was described and played out in the book...",Eragon
1132,chocolate_n_cheeze,"To watch, or not to watch... There is NO question",3,28 December 2006,"I think this is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. I am a huge fan of the book and I can't believe that I waited for THREE YEARS to see this load of crap. The best part of the movie was the end. It barely followed the plot of the book, cut out more than half of the major events, and was cut way too short. I wouldn't see this movie again if someone threatened to force feed me nails. It was very cheesy, especially the two minute period in which Saphira magically grows up; also, periods that spanned two months in the book spanned several hours in the movie. The ONLY reason I gave the movie a three out of ten, was because of the good animation on Saphira. This movie is an insult to all loyal Eragon fans. To summarize: if you have read the book, don't see the movie. After seeing the movie, me and my Eragon loving friends had a conversation on how stupid and idiotic the movie was. After seeing how crappy Eragon was, we are scared to see Eldest.~Kristina (A VERY angry fan)",Eragon
1133,gseedstrike,Some lame brain wanted to make a quick cash cow and totally ruined the movie,1,28 December 2006,"I agree with a lot of what i am readying the Books were amazing and were inspirational. I was delighted when i heard that a movie was being made out of the book, I was looking forward to a new movie that would rival Harry Potter and Lord of the Rings and further more I LOVE Dragons!! so i was very excited. Instead I was let down, way down, down a bottomless pit! Never in my life have i seen such bad translation for book to movie. I don't think i need to repeat all things that re bad with the film that everyone else has mentioned and only say directly to 20th Century Fox YOU SCREWED UP AND THE ERAGON MOVIE NEEDS TO BE PULLED FROM THE THEATERS AND REMADE RIGHT!! AND ALL THOSE ERAGON FUNS YOU DISAPPOINTED SHOULD BE REFUNDED IN FULL FOR HAVING TO SIT THOUGHT THE MOST AWFUL ATTEMPT (IF IT CAN BE CALLED AS SUCH) AT MAKING ERAGON INTO A MOVIE AND I HOPE THAT IF AND WHEN CHRISTOPHER POALINI SEES IT HE DENIES YOU FURTHER RIGHTS TO PRODUCE ANY SEQUELS AND GIVES THEM TO ANOTHER MOVIE STUDIO BECAUSE FOX DOESN'T DESERVE IT!!!!!!!",Eragon

The special effects were great, but unless you have read the book you won't know whats going on and will not be able to follow the movie. I don't know how much money was spent on this disgrace but it sure as hell wasn't worth it. I sure hope they do a better job on the next one and maybe they can correct some of the errors in the first. This movie hit me the same way that the first Dune movie did, very disappointing, the mini series later was much better. Hopefully someone will see the injustice that this movie has made of one of the best books that I have read in quite a long time.",Eragon
1135,airan_raptor,Complete let down!,1,29 December 2006,hell i wouldn't even rate this movie as 1 they ain't got a O... i am a avid fan of the inheritance trilogy and i had high hopes for this movie. which now in hindsight were bit to high as im posting this the movie is playing in the background i gave up on watching it.. Book number one had a fantastic storyline and was amazingly portrayed but this movie should not be a reflection on the books. to all reading this post read the books and don't bother with the movie.. the film in my belief is too short they have missed out Vital bits of the storyline and as well the storyline of the book DOES NOT even follow the movie plot line in any basic form!! characters are poorly executed.. storyline is poorly executed only good side about the movie is saphira which they do deserve some credit for BUT not much.. i am not going to bother finishing the movie and will not even think about going to see the 2nd movie the elder... *sigh* they've ruined a amazing trilogy.. all in all a disappointment... thanks for you time .. if you haven't read the books to you the movie might be good but read the books there is the real story,Eragon
1136,moki_marbles,sucked...,1,29 December 2006,"This doesn't even deserve a 1. First of all the movie moves a incredibly fast speed so if you haven't read the book you kind of get lost. Also the amount they chopped out of the book like 3 of my favorite characters, horst, Jeod, and Solembum. I suppose if you can manage to follow along and haven't read the book this is probably a fine and dandy movie for you, but if you have read the book words just escape you for how horrified you will be by it. In the book when Eragon finds Arya he knows she is an elf because she has POINTED EARS! but in the movie I suppose they were to lazy to make even a horrible attempt at giving her pointed ears. And wow don't get me started on the dwarfs... no beards, almost the same height as men, no rough accents... Saphira was OK her voice-over was entertaining the actor did a good job, and CG was nice but they needed to make her scalier, spikier, and bigger in my opinion. In the long run if you haven't read the book you may want to check the movie out, but if you have read the book... well... just stay as far away as possible.",Eragon
1137,monsterwookie,C'mon People!,2,29 December 2006,"I'm not a baker or anything, but this is the easiest way I can explain how this movie was...Like making bread: First, the had their ingredients(plot, characters, storyline) But they put the wrong ingredients in the bowl. Then, they had to let the ingredients rise(they filmed the movie)But they didn't let it rise long enough Then, they added more foul ingredients and let it rise a second time just to get the same heinous results Last, they put it in the oven and let the bread(movie)burn, be destroyed.I would like to address all those dull people out there that this movie did not suck because of Paolini's books, but because of the silly directors work! The books are inspiring, and this movie was just cheesy, blunt, had no depth, no amusement, nor entertainment, definitely not going to be a classic. Where's Peter Jackson when you need him? This director obviously either hasn't had experience with movies or is just unintelligent, seeing as only someone who's either being threatened or is simply stupid could say this movie was good. This movie embarrassed the books. It's so far off the plot, it only seems coincidental that the characters have the same names.

I thought the effects were great! Think of this as more of a ""cliff notes"" for the book. The baby dragon is as cute as ""puss"" in ""Shreck"". The casting of the parts fit well the image I had of the characters. I am looking forward to the ""Eldest"". The only thing I thought was missing was the building of the relationship of Eragon and his teacher. There was not much build-up to the learning of his powers. Maybe they plan on doing more of this in the next one. As for it being too much like ""Lord of the Rings"", It will be hard for any movie of this type not to be compared to ""The Lord of the Rings"" but this movie proves to be lighter.",Eragon

It could have followed the storyline a bit better, but even though it changed it was still awesome. I hope they turn Eldest and the next book after that into a movie too. If you liked the movie, you should read the books! They are even better! Even if you wait until it is on DVD or video, you HAVE to see this movie. It's graphics (is that what you would call the dragon?) are great, I love the storyline, and just the whole thing is awesome. I strongly recommend it. SEE IT!

And since when do dragons have feathers?! I was really hoping that the movie would be as good as the book because the book is incredible, but i was sadly disappointed. I wish that it could be done over right, but we all know that won't happen. It could have (and should have) been a fantastic movie. If I had gone by myself I would have left Way before the end, but instead I had to sit through the torture of the entire film. Sign me up for not seeing the next one!

Had I not, I'm sure I would have enjoyed the movie more. I kept seeing how much the playwright keep messing up. Basic principle, you cannot drastically change core plot elements of a movie turned book. Especially in a trilogy! I read the books excitingly and I was almost always nose deep anticipating the next chapter. During the movie I was just bored. The characters were extremely one-dimensional. I couldn't make any connection with them because they were just fake. I do not blame the actors for this, more the director.The depiction of the race of elves and dwarfs was so human it was sickening. The book gives so much description of the races and that is all thrown out in the movie.The bond between Roran and Eragon is non-existent and their time in the Hadarac Desert was completely forgotten. There goes character development.The ending is what caught me off guard the most. The time spent in farthen dur was extensive and extremely important toward the next movie/book. During this time the twins were introduced, Angela played a key role, Eragon trained more, and the relationship between Hrothgar and Ajhemid and Eragon was non-existent.The list of all the differences is on Wikipedia. The book is amazing read it, but leave the movie alone.I wish I had waited for the DVD so I hadn't wasted the seven dollars for it.",Eragon

If you are a huge faithful fan or a regular movie go-er and haven't touched the book I recommend not even thinking of going to this movie. The imagery is the only okay thing of this movie. The movie starts out at the forest where The Shade waits for Arya and right there the movie crumbled, the acting was high-schoolish and the story was in a rush (it seemed like the movie was going to another scene ever two seconds). The transitions in this movie made me get a migraine. The only good action was at the town( it was so hard to even know where the heck we were in the movie) when the bridge blows up. This should defintaly be remade in the future by some one with the WORTHY TALENT of CREATING MOVIES!!!!",Eragon

I come from the generation who played Dungeons & Dragons at school during breaks. Jeremy Irons (Brom) was my favorite in this movie, both for the rendition of his character and his overall acting. I was grossly disappointed in John Malkovich, who did a great job of over-acting his character. The newcomer who plays Eragon seemed uncomfortable at the beginning, and his acting become more polished as the movie trudged on. Rachel Weisz, as Saphira's voice, was wonderful. I gave this movie a 6 because I did find it entertaining. I would recommend it as a matinée or rental. I hope that the studios give it at least one more chance for Part II. Maybe the acting will be more refined.",Eragon

It also didn't really get involved with Eragon's life, and how he took care of Saphira. As an audience, I think we didn't know the characters enough to have a compassion for them. This movie also skipped basically all the towns that Brom and Eragon visited. If you haven't read the book, then you probably think the movie was decent, but on the other hand if you are a fan of the Inheritance trilogy, this is a major disappointment.I believe they messed up the rest of the movies, but maybe somehow they can fix it, but not likely.",Eragon

The scenes they do have are all messed up. what was that when Eragon touches Saphira when Galbatorix, Arya and Brom felt it! why did the egg look like a jelly bean??!! not to mention its so rushed if you haven't read the book you have no idea whats going on. they do almost nothing in Trondhiem its like they get there and suddenly the Urgals are here. and what happened to the Urgals horns! I think Paolini should be very insulted by the book. the director and screenwriter totally mocked the book. they tore it up, threw it down and stomped on it.

What is going on in their head. Like they could do better. I guess some people are never satisfied.I started reading the book when I was about 12 or 13 (I'm 15 now) and just got so into it. I was wondering when they would make a movie on it and when I heard they were, I got so excited. I told my mom and my sister to read it too and they both loved it. I love to write too, but I'm not as good as Christopher Paolini. I like books with adventure. I've read all the Harry Potter books that have come out and rate them 10/10. I rate the book Eragon 10.5/10! I have also read Eldest and rate that one 11/10! The ending of that one was so awesome. For school we had to write a persuasive essay and my topic was that every person in the world should read Eragon sometime in their life. It is the best book I've ever read.The movie was no different. My favorite movies include Star Wars, Pirates of the Caribbean, Chronicles of Narnia (new), Harry Potter, and now Eragon. The actors did a wonderful job. For being a first-time actor, Ed Speleers did such a great job on playing Eragon. He was just as I pictured in my mind. Actually he was better! Jeremy Irons was so great too. I loved his voice and could totally tell he was Scar in The Loin King. Sienna Guillory was awesome. She was just as I pictured her too. I'd have to say that my favorite character in the book was Murtagh and it was the same for the movie. He reminds me of an Anakin Skywalker in Star Wars. I hate to leave anyone out, I loved all the actors. They were SO great. What people say about the actors being terrible and ""just in it for the money"" is absurd. I would love to be in a movie like that just as an extra. I would love to see how it is all put together. They also did a wonderful job on creating Saphira and the voice of her was so perfect.Sure the movie was different from the book, but seriously, what movie that was based on a book was exactly like it? Harry Potter wasn't exactly like the books, Chronicles of Narnia wasn't exactly like the book, even Lord of the Rings wasn't exactly like the books. If Eragon was the same as the book, it would probably be 5 to 6 hours long. Then people would complain that it was too long.I don't care what people say. I loved the movie and the directors need to be complimented on, not criticized. They worked so hard, pulled it off and made a really, really, really, awesome movie. I congratulate them and I really hope they keep going and make the next two.",Eragon

Just after watching it in the Theater I went on a bookstore to buy the 2 books!!! What I understand about so many 1/10 marks is that it is only given by people who knew the books before.

It did an extremely bad job of keeping it in line with the book! 5mins into the movie, I wanted to leave. I was the only one in the theater so I was able to scream at it all I wanted to, and believe me I did! I got so fed up with I started playing solitaire on my Ipod! I almost one! I was counting the seconds until it was over and they seemed to drag on and on. I left with 15mins to go because I couldn't stand it anymore. It's such a shame to, because the book was awesome and so was the second. Christopher should have been more careful to whom he gave rights to. I understand that directors and such have to make movies that were once books so they fit in a hour and 30min time frame. So somethings are going to be cut out. But I mean come on! They didn't just cut things out, they completely rearranged the plot and made it there own not so master masterpiece! Brom killing a Ra'zac and getting killed by a shade! That is just not right! How do they expect to do a sequel when they didn't even include dwarfs or hint on the fact that Arya was an elf! I would NOT recommend this to ANYONE, unless I wanted them to suffer an hour and 39mins of pure torture. Maybe next time they should get a Harry Potter producer and director! They always do a good job of keeping it in line with the story! I knew going into the movie that it wasn't going to be very good, but I didn't think it would be THAT bad!",Eragon

Definitely worth seeing for any fantasy nut out there.True, there are a lot of differences from the book. I haven't read it, so I may be a little biased, but I think just as a movie, not compared to the book, it was very well done.And if you're like me, you'll have even more fun making fun of the clichés after you walk out of the theater.But all in all, definitely worth seeing.

Certain characters in the movie, weren't part of the book...(example: Angela-In the book, is suppose to be a old woman fortune teller with a were-cat; in the movie, she is this young woman-and there is no were-cat!!). Harry Potter and Lord of the Rings have defiantly put a new outlook on fantasy films, and because of that, I expected so much more from Eragon. It probably would have been better if the director would have even bothered to pick up just one of the books and read it. This is the worst fantasy film of all time. Christopher Paolini, I love your books and i can't wait for the third one, if you do continue on with the next movie, be extremely specific on whom your director is (ex: directors of LOTR or Harry Potter), and please make sure they read your books too.",Eragon
1154,chantelbertolotti,I would rather read the book instead,5,1 January 2007,"I had quite high expectations of this movie, and it generally did NOT measure up to what I anticipated. The casting was relatively good, and the animations of Saphira were visually pleasing. BUT there were major plot holes, and the movie generally made a whole lot less sense unless you had read the book first. Fans of the book may be disappointed in how the characters look, as some did not seem to fit the descriptions in the book. For me, I didn't absolutely love the movie, but it wasn't the worst novel-to-movie I've ever seen. I highly recommend reading the book before seeing the movie, so you understand what the movie left out.",Eragon
1155,ritipatel,"If you thought the movie was good, read the book.",2,2 January 2007,"After reading the book, I was hoping for something that would do it justice, but this was terrible. In my opinion it was too short, if the time had been increased by about an hour, some of the storyline that was taken out could have been put back in. The film was also extremely rushed. Looking at it as just a film, it was OK, although still rushed, but compared to the book it was nowhere near OK. Sitting in the cinema, i remember thinking ""What's going on here?"". However, i thought Jeremy Irons' portrayal of Brom was very good and also that Durza was quite good. Basically, if you've never heard of Eragon, read the book, don't watch the film.",Eragon
1156,wrandall5696,Great Book...Lousy Movie,1,2 January 2007,"Although, if I were a child of 10 who had not read the book, I might have enjoyed the movie, I found the book was an insult to the great talent of a very young author! Hopefully he will keep the artistic license, as has Stephen King, for any future movies. Frankly so much was altered and/or omitted, I cannot see how a movie on the second book can be made without totally ignoring the story. This is so typical of movies anymore with the screen writer/director feeling they can tell a better story than the author. I highly recommend that if you have read the book, that you not bother with the movie. If you have not read the book, do it before seeing the movie!",Eragon
1157,narjisyed786,not good but not bad,10,7 January 2007,"it was alright. IF th movie did not miss a lot of parts then it would have been a good movie for example harry potter the goblet of fire about 2 hours and 45 minutes there was not many parts missing just a few and they were not really necessary to put in i mean come on that was a good movie. But in eragon the ACTOrs were and ed speelers is a beginner and he did do his lines very well and the other actors were excellent actors and played there line very well including the one who played saphira she was the only reason i thought the movie was worth watching. I mean seriously eragon the book is really great and since they made a movie about it it seems as thought the book was nothing but a piece of sand flowing in the wind. To the people who have read the book my advice to you is if you want to watch the movie just watch the trailer first and read the ra tings and then decide if u still want to watch because they missed a lot of parts and the ones that were there were not right, they missed ,many important parts, an d it was really short they could have made it 3 hours long and it would have been a great movie, like lord of te rings.",Eragon
1158,markelinosotelo,The most despicable fantasy movie ever!,3,2 January 2007,"I first saw the book two years ago in a store. I wanted it. Last year, I saw in the newspaper that there was going to be a movie based on the book. So I bought it to beat time and read the book first before spoiling myself the story. I finished it. It was great. Then, a few days ago, when I watched the movie, I was horrified. Who the hell is the damn director? Huh? How the hell could he choose Edward Speleers...beg my pardon, EDWARD SPOILERS, a guy that is a so-called ""actor"", interpreting such a mystical and complex character. Another thing: the length of the movie. TOO SHORT. Only an hour and a half. They only showed a quarter of the story. The script was wrong. The scoring was wrong. They produced it wrong. They adapted it wrong. The battles were very short and very bad coreographated. I grade the performances by the following: A 10 for Rachel Weisz, who is the only perfect performance in the whole movie.A 9 for Jeremy Irons, John Malkovich and Robert Carlyle, who, despite of the cartoon dialogs in the script, they did the best they could in order to make it an excellent movie.An 8 for Sienna Guillory, Djimon Hounsou, Garret Hendlund and Joss Stone.An, a -1000 for Edward Speleers, who is too American to play such a complex character, as I said.An advice for 20th Century Fox: Make the movie again. With another director, another scrip-writer, and another actor to perform Eragon.",Eragon
1159,imsexy-1,Was a great Movie,8,2 January 2007,"I think this movie was great. I don't think it was anything like an SNL skit. I liked the way they created the Dragon, very neat. The story was good but I do agree that it was left open like a LOTR movie and there are certain things that look like they were taken from LOTR to be honest. Still it has enough of it's own story to be different from LOTR so don't worry about that you are not going to see a hobbit with a magic ring or giant talking trees. I think they could have expanded the story more and had more battle scenes. The big battle of the movie was cool in some parts and in some parts a little lacking but you will know what I mean when you see it. In general I think it is a movie that should be seen on the big screen if you want the full effect of it. The characters I think could have been developed a little better but there is time for that if and when they make the 2nd movie. Is it worth the time and money to see? I think so. Is it something kids could see and enjoy? Yes but some of the evil characters may possibly scare kids under 12. Is there a lot of gore? No it is like the rating says friendly to those with no stomach for blood and guts.",Eragon
1160,AkariNezumi,totally Agreeing,6,3 January 2007,"Eragon was an OK movie IF you haven't read the book if You have Read the book and YOU want to go see it wait til it comes out to rent and save yourself some money you'll be disappointed by all the visual and plot fallacies in the movie but at least Edward Speelers is hot and however a bit scrawnier and shorter than i imagined was what i thought of as Eragon so I agree with the guy who left the first comment and my rating on this film would have to be a 6 because it had it's moments that were really cool and good with the graphic design and for Durza's big seen in a pit(if you've seen it you know what i'm talking about) Akari Nezumi PS to the guy who left the first comment Durza's scars around his mouth are the arstist's interpretation of of how Durza is supposed to be an kinda undead mage possessed with evil spirits so to give the unknowing audience the sense that ""oh this guy looks like a fresh zombie"" at least that's what i and most of the people i've talked with see it as too",Eragon
1161,joe-sands,no one told me this was a comedy,3,3 January 2007,"I saw this movie with eight other friends in support of one friend who really liked the books. We laughed the whole way through! As the movie progressed its ridiculousness became more laughable. The kitsch fantasy costumes reminded me of the over-the-top costumes of old Cleopatra movies. The timing of expressions and scenes often ruined any possibility of being taken seriously (particularly when a dragon paused after saying something inspirational then groaned out of nowhere). If you want to see Lord of the Rings than see it. But in my opinion, this movie is not a good alternative to it. I would rate this movie as awful but I was far too entertained.",Eragon
1162,Allinoe,"I expected more ... , well just more!!!",5,4 January 2007,"I saw this movie just yesterday. And my comment on it is, well... I guess I expected more ..., well just more! (like the protagonist repeated twice) First of all, why were these actors cast for their role, this was, if I may say so, a major stupidity. Eragon, the leading character is in my point of view just irritating, and oh man, what is he a pain in the ass! He is barely an adult, no he is an overexcited teen who one day discovers a dragon egg and the next day he 's so deluded he thinks he can take on the world. Anyway enough about that, further I found the dialogues superficial. There are parts in the movie where you can't help but wonder what they are babbling about. That was the most disappointing. Eragon has nice features, but it never takes you to a higher level. It was like it got stuck on a level for 14-year-olds. The directors try to give it a sense of likability in such a way it is too obvious to really feel it. For example: in the beginning where eragon and his cousin are fighting is the straw. I was also a bit disappointed by the layout of the evil kings headquarters. It was so 'empty'. I didn't think the movie was horrible but I think I overrated it in my mind before seeing it. After the movie was over I realized that there would be a sequel, well then I hope the director read comments like this so they can improve on things where they went wrong. Finally I want to conclude my comment with yet another catchphrase from the movie: The movie was 1 part brave and three part foolish!!!",Eragon
1163,jlm-kaldenbach,Mwoa,5,5 January 2007,"Personally I didn't dislike the movie but it wasn't a very good one either. There aren't a whole lot of good fantasy movies and I think it is great that an interest in this sort of movies is growing but please do not abuse the original story line.I didn't like the casting for the parts.. arya was too young, durza wasn't very scary up until the end scene were his make up was clearly better. They left out too much of the actual story and created a flimsy shell to represent the book.Do yourself a favor; read the book(s) they are amazingly good.www.itka.nl",Eragon
1164,jK-232,Sequel?,6,3 January 2007,"Eragon was average,the special effects are decent but are always going to be, the dragon was done very well, she was exactly how i imagined her i must admit, including the voice. The acting is a bit rubbish at times, and there is a lot of cheese in it, and i mean a lot, why do they have to do that? Robert Carlyle and Malkovich are good baddies. But the book is always going to be obviously better and the film could have been better if it followed the book...I see the sequel book is called Eldest, haven't read it though, has that already been made into a film? I notice the film is not on IMDb, not even in pre production? Are they going to make it and is it called Eldest?",Eragon
1165,dire_wolf100,What the HECK were they thinking?,1,3 January 2007,"This movie was easily the worst movie I saw in 2006. The acting was poor, the script was weak, and the overall feel of the movie was that they put minimal effort into it and hoped to make money simply because all the people who read the book would rush blindly into theaters to see it. If you've read the book you will hate the movie. If you haven't read the book, there is a 50/50 chance that you will hate the movie. There was little or no similarity between the book that this movie was supposedly based on and the movie itself. Major characters from the book were either mentioned briefly or left out all together. Also several MAJOR plot points were left out of the movie. I hope and pray that the second book, Eldest, will not be made into a movie, though with how drastically they altered the overall story in the first movie it really wouldn't be possible to make a movie based on the second book. I really wish it were possible to rate this movie lower than one star. Bottom line, do not see this movie, read the book instead.",Eragon
1166,charity-mccollum,Save Your Money Read the Book,1,3 January 2007,"I was very disappointed in this film. The director left out key points that are necessary for the second half of the movie. I will try not to spoil it for those who have not read the book, but Arya is not human she is an elf so make her look like one, and did anyone see one dwarf at the battle of Farthen Dur, and what about the twins? The twins are vital to the second battle, and lets not forget the importance of the supposed death of a certain character that the director seemed to forget. Also the fortune teller left out quite a bit for example that someone close to Eragon will betray him, and where is the Werecat? Also the fortune teller is supposed to be in a city called Terim, with a big stone wall and beautiful stone buildings that are close to each other, not little huts. Also what was the point of having Brom in the movie if he was not going to train Eragon? People if you haven't read the book Eragon does not learn to use powers on his own Brom trains him. This movie was so frustrating to me. The sad thing is, this is only a portion of what was left out. It is obvious that the screen writer did not read the second book before making the movie. I guess thats not a problem because he pulls things out of thin air. The movie does not do the book justice, and I will not be wasting my money on the second one.",Eragon
1167,chris-pederson,Great 2 hours of fun,8,4 January 2007,"I really enjoyed this one. I had never read fantasy books or been into D&D and all that, but after this I can see the appeal. Its was a great story that I think kids and adults can enjoy. It reminds me of how much I loved knights and castles when I was a kid. Visiting home from Iraq I didn't want to see all the Hollywood versions of the troubles of the world and just wanted some good escapist adventure tales. If you're looking for something dark, see every other movie that is out. This is good stuff where the nice guys fight the bad guys selflessly and with great courage and honor. The kind of movies I don't think they make too much anymore. I am hoping they make a second.",Eragon

I was therefore excited to hear that they were making a movie and couldn't wait to watch it. But, after watching the film, I wish they made me wait longer for a film with a better director and/or budget. Either that or I wish they never made the film at all.Compared to what I had in mind when I was reading the book, the film was way too cheesy, the characters were weak, the effects were way too amateur and the script was so bad you can't believe the author accepted it. Get this, (SPOILER warning), in the battle scene at the end of the film, you hear a command for archers to be battle-ready. What do you get, 2 persons, positioning themselves in the middle of the battle area. Just two! And, yeah, they get wiped out before you can say what-the..! Oh, and the ending is horribly different from the book and so CGI heavy. You even get a wizard flying a smoke-dragon around makes you wonder why they needed dragon riders in the first place.If you're into Lord of the Rings and Harry Potter, read the book. But the film just feels like cold water being thrown on you on a cold winter night.",Eragon
1169,kjsacramento,Don't go if you are only interested in sex and violence,8,4 January 2007,"Certainly those of us who love fantasy were spoiled by the extravagance and originality of Lord of the Rings, but I still was able to enjoy the basic story line that has been repeated in thousands of movies before it successfully. The sets were beautiful, filmed in Hungary and Canada, and many excellent and well-known British actors gave it a recognized warmth. I was wowed by the scenery and, as I always am, thrilled by the dragon in flight and the eyes of the baby dragon making its first attachment. Other than that, there seemed to be a lack of satisfying character development, which may or may not be due to the recognizability of the usual roles. I felt a lack of threat from the villains, despite their evil appearance and powers and never really felt the usual tension. Perhaps that is the issue throughout that lets me down a little. It is all just too usual and perhaps that is why. We've seen so many like it that a change of the mask/the actor just isn't enough any more. We all keep wanting it bigger and better - so much so that we forget to just enjoy it for what it is. We can all watch ""White Christmas"" every year of our lives and still find pleasure in it even though we know it line-for-line. I feel sad that so many viewers cannot give any of the dragon movies the same consideration. Yes, the story's been told before, about dragon's and heroes and villains, about good versus evil, about learning about our own limitations, but anyone who gave it a 1 either doesn't know that 10 is good and 1 is bad, or they shouldn't have gone to this type of movie in the first place. I can only think they were disappointed that there wasn't a lot of gory blood and sex, because this movie does not deserve a 1. The scenery by itself would earn it a 3 or 4 even if the rest was hated. I myself wish we had more development of fantasy and more dragons and Harry Potters and the like and much less blood and violence.If you are looking for a cutting edge movie and accepting of nothing less, this movie is probably not for you. If you are someone who can enjoy dragon fantasy on an old-fashioned level - go and enjoy. And certainly I could see my children enjoying it thoroughly, except the very small ones who would be scared of an ugly mask. Those who voted ""1"" - give me a break.",Eragon

1172,alex-weissfels,Star Wars in a Lord of the Rings set-up,3,5 January 2007,"I felt that this movie was a poor combination of Star Wars and Lord of the Rings. Eragon follows with a disturbing similarity the storyline of Star Wars. The dramatic structure is the same and the archetypal characters used are almost identical. Therefore this movie is very predictable and fails to bring forward anything original. Furthermore the characters are so flat that even great actors like Irons, Carlyle or Malkovich cannot bring this script to life. Even compared to the Lord of the Rings it utterly fails to provide the depth of Tolkien's story. In terms of visual effects it tries to achieve the vivid fantasy set-up of the Lord of the Rings and there are instances when it succeeds. Nevertheless, even with rather good visual effects but with a poorly told story the outcome is a very forgettable experience.",Eragon
1173,splongey,They did an absolute hack-job of it.,2,5 January 2007,"Basically, I hope Christopher Paulini sues. Seriously, it seems like they put more effort into making the stupid website for the movie than the actual movie itself. I, myself, am an enormous fan of Christopher's fantasy novels, and even own a copy of Eragon which i am currently reading. Like many others, i was overjoyed when i heard from a friend that they were making it into a movie, and was extremely anxious to see it. I could not have been more disappointed when i did. For one thing, it was lacking in the development of major characters and events. I know there is no easy way around this, but they could have at least tried to stick the plot as best they could and made it longer - it could have been 4 hours for all i care, as long as it was good! For example, many of the characters where underdeveloped., Murtagh is a major character in the book. A few glitches in the movie: In the book he reveals to Eragon who is is BEFORE they reach the Varden, not after, and he Doesn't WANT TO GO TO THE VARDEN! HE PROTESTS!! In the movie hes all ""oh ya, i know where the varden are and i'll take you there, it'll be fun!"" where in the book he's all ""no, i absolutely will not go to the varden and you cannot make me"" completely opposite!! Oh ya, and were are the twins that interrogate them to make sure that they are not spys or whatever? Where is the dragon cavern? Where is the child that he blesses that becomes a major part of the second book? Why can you see the sky in the city when it is in a mountain? The hole in the roof is supposed to be in the dragon cavern! The monsters were hideously simple and completely different than what they were in the book. The Razac are supposed to be tall, ominous things wearing black cloaks, that have beaks, they are not weird creatures made of bugs. The urgals are not supposed to be men that look funny, they are tall monsters with horns that ever so slightly resemble men. Whatever happened to the city that they were supposed to have destroyed, with the pile of bodies? If i were to list all of this movies faults, I could write a book of decent length. However, i have one compliment:The dragon was amazing.Oh yes, one more thing i forgot to point out. The flying scenes would have been wonderful - if they had looked real. You could completely tell that the background and Eragon riding Saphira were simply cut and paste. Also, the could-have-been amazing scenery views were all but. They were choppy, not smooth, and i don't know the terminology for this or how to say it, but it just did not seem movie-quality, it looked like it had been filmed for a documentary if you get what i mean. It just didn't fit. Let us pray that they remake it - a different company. I adore this book, but the film made me gag. It is an absolute insult to the amazing work of Christopher Paulini and i hope that somebody does something about it.",Eragon
1174,DrakenRider,Not good,4,5 January 2007,"If you read the books,well...then I guess the movie will surely disappoint you.It's a total fiasco.The only good things about it are the acting of Jeremy Irons, John Malkovich and Rachel Weisz as the voice of Saphira.And pretty good CGI.Edwards Spellers does a let's say decent job as Eragon, although his acting is a little stiff.They should have elaborated on the story not offer a really short version of it.I think the main issue here is time.They simply cut up lots of interesting things from the book leaving only a skeleton.Overall I think it should have been a 3 hour long movie instead of just half.

We liked the storyline, character development, and the representation of the dragon.At first I was worried about the youngest child, but they did just fine.

But I'm still hoping that maybe someday they might redo this movie and actually stick to the book and to the facts. But it might not happen because I've never hear of someone redoing a movie because the first one sucked. I saw the movie first before reading the book and I found a lot of it to be boring and I was lost for the longest time about certain things. The acting was way off and the plot itself was kind of lame. The only think I really enjoyed about this movie was Rachel's voice over. She's an Oscar winner and her abilities brought some light to the movie. I enjoyed her voice for the dragon and if they plan on doing a sequel (shrinks in horror)they got to bring her back! If they change her character to some wanna-be female actress then it might not be as good.,Eragon

I really have to say that this movie was a bust for anyone who read the book; however, for young children who did not this movie might peek their interest. I feel bad for the author of Eragon because this movie did not do his book any justice at all. So, overall, a big thumbs down from me.",Eragon

I guess I was expecting another ""Lord of the Rings"" or ""Harry Potter"" entertainment. The graphics for Saphira were excellent. Perhaps the Director should read the book and try to maintain the true storyline. Get the author involved!

The story, although, its not bad, not at all... But it's not original either! and that's the shocking thing... It's just Star Wars on a LOTR scenario. And that, that is just depressing. Because this movie is actually based on a novel, and this novel is just an adaptation of a cult film in order to get children to spend 20 bucks on a book, so, who would have such a criminal idea?! Now, if we talk about this concept as a horror/fantasy idea... then the whole thing changes. Oh wait, it doesn't! Yeah, so keep that trilogy at home and wait for Eragon part two, guys...

1184,Judipros,Disappointing to say the least. Save your money,3,7 January 2007,"I was very disappointed in this movie. After reading the book, I thought what a great trilogy this could be; one that could mirror Lord of the Rings. Unfortunately, I was dead wrong. The special effects were good, but with the exception of Jeremy Irons, the acting was poor. Kudos to the artists who created Saphira. She appeared life-like. I was disappointed to see characters missing from the movie that were in the book. King Hrothgar wasn't even introduced. Sure he appeared in the movie, but if you didn't read the book, you had no idea who he was. Christopher Paolini must be extremely disappointed that the movie wandered so far from the storyline. Paolini's writing is what encouraged me to go see the movie. I think with a little better casting, more money and about an hour's worth more of film that stayed true to the storyline, this movie would be a smash hit. Unfortunately it isn't. Although I most likely will read the second book, Elder, if the second movie is anything like the first, I'll pass. For those who have not seen the movie, save your money and wait until it comes to DVD.",Eragon
1185,Damonwa16,a fun movie if you haven't read the book If your a fan of the books like myself don't bother seeing it you will be sorely disappointed!!,3,7 January 2007,"First I got to say that I did read both the first book and the second book and I am a great fan of them and look forward to the third book. When I first heard that there was a movie coming out a year ago I was truly excited cause the books are just phenomenal and are definitely up there with the lord of the rings trilogy. Yes I have heard all the people comparing it to the lord of the rings but its own story and even Tolkeins books were based on older stories and myths. Now that said on to the movie lol, I was truly disappointed with the movie it was completely different from the book. I first expected it to be bad when I saw in early photos of certain characters like Arya the elf character that she didn't have pointed ears like all elves have, also she is described clears and repeatedly in the books as having raven black hair and here cloths were black which was the total opposite in the movie. Then there was the urgals who in the books aren't barbaric humans like they looked in the movie but the had horns and are far more animal like in the books. When I saw these differences I knew along with my friends that it would go down hill from there. Also characters that were integral were dropped from the movie which made no sense. Now I don't have a problem with the casting I think that that actors and actresses were perfect, but the script was disgusting and completely disrespected the book it was supposed to be based on. Critical events were left out making huge gaps and leaving me with questions and even events and scenes were combined out of order. The characters in the said scenes were switched for other character. Another thing that bothered me along with scenes being dropped places was taken out or nothing like they were described in the book. An example of this is the mountain city of Farthen Dur which in the book is a Dwarf city one of their greatest located in the center of the mountain and is as big as a mountain itself. Also the dwarfs and elves are mentioned but aren't even in the movie what's up with that?? This all together made the film with other reasons just horrible dragon aside which was magnificently done.Personally I think that Christopher Paolini the author whom I have nothing but respect for had no control over his vision being put to script. If I could suggest to him if I had the chance I would suggest that if he had a second chance to make eragon over again to keep the cast but do it on the sci-fi channel like they did Frank Herbert's Dune and Children of Dune as a sci-fi mini series event that way the book could be kept intact as much as possible at least 90% to 95% like they did with those movies and they were fantastically done and up to par with any Hollywood film. That's just my thoughts on the film.I can go on with this but you get the Idea.",Eragon
1186,waffle_shadow,A great Movie,10,8 January 2007,"Although the movie went kind of fast, and didn't have a lot from the book, I still enjoyed it nevertheless. Everyone played their part perfectly, and everything went well in the plot! I have heard that the book is better, however I think that they are both good equally. Alothough I am in the midst of reading the book, I can tell that the director put a lot of effort into making the movie just as good as the book. Of all the movies I have seen, this one was one of my personal favorites. I have always enjoyed fantasy and such, and this one will be one of them that I will buy when it comes out on DVD! I hope that a lot of people will agree as to saying that this is a good movie for those who enjoy fantasy, and dragons.",Eragon
1187,hannahbtf5,my thoughts on the movie compared to the book,6,8 January 2007,"It was a great movie, but i was definitely disappointed i went to the movie theater hoping to see the book Eragon on screen, but it was nothing like the book! i know that the director can't get it perfect, but it definitely could have been better in so many different ways. but all in all, it was a great movie, especially if you have never read the book... too bad i have. I mean, there was that part when he killed the Razaak... what was that? and there was hardly any Angela the herbalist and no Teirm at all! It did have it's similarities, but it was definitely lacking in the 'like the book' part. The characters, though, were very nicely chosen in my opinion. I think the actors they chose for the parts were practically perfect, and Eragon and Murtagh were not too bad looking either, tee hee! but i don't think they could really have chosen better actors!",Eragon
1188,josephgareth,Not faithful to the novel that it takes its title from.,1,9 January 2007,"Very disappointing considering the scope provided by the Christopher Paolini novel to make an amazing epic adventure. This film falls short in every department from plot and character development to production values. The film also tells a very different story from that of the book, manipulating key elements of the books content to suit the story that the makers of film version of Eragon wished to tell, as opposed to tailoring the actual story told to suit the screen. The result of this is that all of the characters lack depth and you get no real sense of how important each of the role playing characters is to the narrative as a whole. What makes this attempt even more disappointing is that, due to the poorly written script, the star studded cast isn't given the opportunity to live up to their full potential thus rendering the involvement of most of them irrelevant.",Eragon
1189,coyotechorus,"The book is much, much, much better.",5,9 January 2007,"First, if you haven't read the book, then you're in the same boat as the scriptwriter and director. Most say, 'the book is always better'. In this case, that would be putting it simply. Perhaps the scriptwriter was jealous that a teenager had written, published and gotten a book made into a movie all before he's old enough to drink. There are some immature points/storytelling, in the book but the scriptwriter wrote even more immaturely. MUCH was left out. Now that you've seen the movie, read the book. The parts of the book that gave it the depth, as in Lord of the Rings, were completely left out of the movie. The characters were not built up well in the movie at all and the importance of certain points in the book, were left out leaving you coming out of the theater not quit satisfied. I hope they make the sequel but use a different scriptwriter and possibly a different director. Maybe they need to hire a 16 year old to advise them. By the way, I'm over 40 so am not biased in favor of teens.",Eragon
1190,brinkdancer21,Very Good.,8,10 January 2007,"I found this movie to be really a good film. However, I think if they had made it a longer movie (say two and a half hours) it would have been even better and they could have included more stuff that would have fleshed out the story and made it not so confusing. I really enjoyed Brom's character and his acting was very good. Eragon's performance could have been a little better, he seemed detached rather than absorbed in his character. This movie is nothing like the book. I saw the movie first then read the book and the discrepancies are anywhere from eye color to raging lumbering wrongs that stare you in the face. The movie was very good, I enjoyed it. The book is okay, I enjoyed that too. I give the movie four starts, the book three, the movies accuracy in depicting the book, zero. The movie was good for the movie, the book was good for the book. Isn't that how it always goes?",Eragon
1191,momiji_sohma4001,Eragon,10,10 January 2007,"Eragon, If I could describe it in one word it would be, fascinating. After reading so many negative movie reviews I wasn't sure if I would enjoy the movie, but surprisingly enough, I LOVED IT! It wasn't like the book, but other than that it was an appealing movie. The special effects where awesome, and Ed Speeler's (Eragon) acting was fantastic for his first movie. Things mostly fell in order, and the film quality was pretty good.My favorite character, well not my favorite exactly, the one who looked closest to what was described in the book was Durza. He looked awesome, very creepy, and he just looked perfectly evil. The king wasn't as good though. The actor John Malkovich seemed more used to playing good characters and did not play the part of and evil king very well. The budget was probably tight for the movie and the special effects cost so much that the staff and the actors they probably got for a cheap fee. Altogether I loved Eragon, and advise those of you who haven't seen it yet to try it. Who knows you might like it!",Eragon
1192,tennisanyone32,Don't waste your money on the movie go buy the book!,1,10 January 2007,Yeah I saw this movie and was totally disappointed. The actors while some were hot were not the best except for the person who played Brom. The special effects were decent but the story line was totally wrong. They screwed it all up and even if you haven't read the book this movie will make almost no logical sense. The war scene is about 5 min. The person that plays the dragon I have to give thumbs up to! But don't waste the money to go see this movie in theaters unless you want to laugh because of how pathetic it was which was all i did during the movie. So save your money and go buy the book. The book you will totally enjoy and gets 10 stars while this movie gets 1.,Eragon
1193,kdsuglia,"Very disgusting, should have waited until the DVD came out.",3,10 January 2007,"My wife and I saw the movie after reading the book. Not only was I appalled at how badly the story was changed and rewritten but the acting from the marquee actors could be considered at a grade of C-. The voice over for the Dragon was pleasant to hear, however not even that made the movie really better. The special effects were very nice. The CGI very good, but faulted in the design of the Dragon. The story line after shrinking from a 16 hour unabridged book to a 99 minute movie definitely does not give justice to Paolini's writing. This movie could rank as high as ""Lord of the Rings"" and the sequels if it were rewritten and correlated closer to the book. Maybe even make it two movies, or a Saga similar to that of ""Star Wars"". The movie definitely does not impress me because of the radical changes. For instance the portrayal of a teacher to be a has been, rebellious drunk instead of a wise old storyteller. Or maybe the insertion of characters into the story line that shouldn't have even been seen in the movie. Or maybe it was the lack of species that were not included in the movies such as Dwarfs, and Elves, this movie is supposed to be Fantasy Science fiction not contemporary renaissance. This movie should definitely go back to the drawing board and be redone.",Eragon
1194,mara_jade_az,Great book does not mean great screenplay,2,10 January 2007,"I went to see this movie for my birthday. I was really excited about it, though to some degree I knew the screenplay wouldn't be exactly like the book. BOY IS THAT AN UNDERSTATEMENT! I haven't been so disappointed in a movie since DaVinci Code. I suppose my error was in reading the book before going to see the film. But even so I can't help but think I still would have come away with a horribly empty and disappointed spirit as I did this past weekend. There are so many dissimilarities between the book and the film that it's almost unrecognizable as what Christopher Paolini set out to accomplish when he penned the novel. Eragon as a book is a well developed masterfully woven story that documents the life of a young man thrust into the world of magic, dragons, war and destiny. It's a captivating story...the movie on the other hand leaves much to be desired. I won't go into the details as to how horrible the screen play was, or how much was missing from the transition from book to movie (including missing key character species like elves and dwarfs). All I will say is that when and if the second book of the trilogy is made into a movie, I will not be among those wasting my money to go see it. I truly hate it when screen writers think they can re-write a story and remove it so completely from the author's work and think they've created something good.",Eragon
1195,lionheart81391,wow this movie is crap,1,11 January 2007,OK first Christopher must have been so excited that he just jumped at the first movie opportunity and now is probably crying his eyes out at the fact that he must know he messed up second fox is A GREEDY MONSTER just wanting to jump on the money train i mean WB has harry potter new line had lord of the rings and his dark materials and poor little fox had nothing well they got greedy and became that kid who gets mad and reeks everyones fun third its missing so much like the family relationship eragon had and the closeness of the town much more but what makes me mad the most is Sapphira's WINGS and Angela the HERBIST not the town slut i mean what the hell was she wearing and then the wearcat i mean did the movie writers even talk to Chris cause the wearcat tells eargon that important info which is obviously a driving point for the last book and they just drop it out Don't SEE THE MOVIE INSTEAD SPEND THE TIME ASKING FOX TO GIVE THE RIGHTS TO NEW LINE !!!!!!!!!,Eragon
1196,thegreatbuddha15,horrible adaptation,1,11 January 2007,"while it is commonplace for the screen adaptation of a book to have errors, things left out, and things put in and sometimes the added visual element calls for it, this films director or whoever was responsible for transcribing it from book to film barely tried to keep with the original spirit of the book. absent characters, whole scenes missing, made up scenes and the absence of major details and plot out-liners, not to mention there are supposed to be three books and the movie didn't leave room for a sequel made this a horrible movie no matter how you look at it. and to add insult to injury most of the characters didn't like how they were described in the book and bad c.g. effects on sapphire just ruined it for me because i have had the book since it came out.",Eragon
1197,kasseykc111,the book was better,5,11 January 2007,Fiasco: is the word that describes better this film. They messed up the movie. The book was brilliant but the film...... awful. When you read the book you think is gonna be a great movie but when u actually watch it you get disappointed and angry. That's because they changed a lot of things. They had this really great story and they could have made this real magnificent movie and they messed it. Everything was horrible from the beginning to the end. That's because a lot of the things that happen in the book weren't even in the film. There are characters that don't even appear!! It seemed that the movie was made very fast and they didn't have a lot of money to produce it. They made mistakes too like the age of eragon I mean whoever made the movie didn't read the book entirely he just read little pieces of it that's why the film is so bad! This the last thing i will say: the BOOK was EXCELLENT but please do a re-make of the movie!,Eragon
1198,jimmys-only-friend,a total letdown,4,11 January 2007,"as a teenager who has read the story, this movie was a total letdown. i was shocked to find that the director and his team managed to cram a 600 page book into under 2 hours of film, and was also incredibly disappointed at the amount of the story that had been cut out of the film, ranging from small details to important characters. this book has been one of my favorites since i first discovered it, and i was so excited when i heard it was being made into a movie. i saw the movie with a friend who had not read the book, and she thought it was a good movie, but i thought it was terrible! in my opinion, one of the only things that was right about the movie was the dragon - hats off to the digital effects guys! they did something right! i really hope that they find a new director, or at least new writers before they make the rest of the trilogy (that is, if they are brave enough to make them after how bad this one turned out), as i believe that my friends and i could write the story better.",Eragon
1199,Fairyprincess127,Eragon,10,12 January 2007,"To the Director and ALL actors and actresses in this movie (including Edward Speleers) very well done! My only complaint is that it wasn't long enough. But all in all I loved it. If you are a fan of fantasy you will love this flick. The CGI and special effects were great and to my amazement it contained sufficient plot. The scenery in the movie was breathtaking. I have no idea where they filmed, but what a landscape! Unlike other fantasy movies this didn't seem to be a bite off of the great LOTR or Harry Potter. Although it did have classical fantasy elements to it's prose it was original in detail. This is a great family film but if you have children under five I would leave them home, some of the scenes are a bit intense and the evil creatures are pretty nasty looking.",Eragon
1200,tehall2,This movie was HORRIBLE,1,12 January 2007,"I guess most movies are mere shadows of the books that they are adapted from, however Eragon the movie could quite possibly be the absolute worst.Eragon and it's sequel Eldest were both outstanding reads and Christopher Paolini most certainly deserves all the accolades he has garnered for them...however, I can't understand why he would have signed off on such a horrible screenplay of his book! Not to mention that the acting was so sub-par and unbelievable, I was shocked that the movie made it to the theaters at all! It seemed like the entire story was re-written with huge, key parts simply taken out! Roran is only in the movie for the first 10 minutes if even that! We never meet Katrina and Brom never mentions his dragon to Eragon. Not only that...but when the heck did Saphira name herself in the book? I must have skipped that chapter...I completely understand the need to shorten timing on certain things and change other things so that they can fit into a movie form, however, the changes made to this were totally extreme. Eragon and Brom never go Tierm to check shipping records. In fact, in the book, they set out to revenge the death of Eragon's uncle...in the movie, they simply set out to ""get to the Vardan"" which in the book, Brom is skeptical of them...where did that story line go? They see Angela in the first town that they stop in (Angela, who is played by Joss Stone, was completely ridiculous as a chanting belly dancer). There was also no cat! Plus, she barely speaks to Eragon...she certainly doesn't foreshadow about his mother like she does in the book! Jeremy Irons was great, as usual, but Ed Speelers needs some more acting lessons. I also did not care for Rachel Weisz as Saphira...her voice was too old.Anyway, there are a million more things that I could go on about, but I will spare you the rest. If you are a serious Eragon fan, don't waste your time with this movie...stick with the books!",Eragon
1201,mydoczoey,Does not measure up to the books,3,12 January 2007,"I have read the both bestsellers Eragon and Eldest a dozen times. This film does not measure up to the books. If it was not for the price of the movie ticket you would think you were watching a high school production. They needed to put more time and effort into making this film. One and half hours was just to short. The books are very graphic like showing you how Eragon learns to use magic. The film does not even show you how he learns to use it, he just uses it. If the film were to be remade the first change would need to start with the actor who played Eragon (Edward Speleers). Very poor choice only because this was his first big screen film.",Eragon
1202,antoinelemonne,Eragon a good movie with bad cast,10,12 January 2007,"Eragon is a movie based on a book which is very popular with many readers and fans. The film which was based on that book was generally based on it, but had many story differences. That is logical because at a book many things can be fully descripted with a very large number of pages but on the film every second means money and it is logical for the producer or producers to cut or recreate the story of a book on a film. At my opinion, Eragon movie should be longer that 100 minutes and had better cast. The only actors who I liked on the film is Jeremy Irons (Brom), who is a very good actor and played good at a lot of other films and John Malkovich (Galbatorix), who is a great actor as well. The main actor, Edward Speleers seems a cool person, but not so good at acting, at least on this film. Sienna Guillory made me laugh at some scenes with her acting skills, I actually prefer her on Resident Evil movie, and I would definitely prefer to see a more book based character with black and not blonde hair, as Arya (one of the most important characters of the story). The director of the film could be better, if he would ... better results could have come ... My daughter liked the movie very much, kids like dragons, magic e.t.c, but I believe that not many adults liked it so much and they did not even compare it with Lord Of The Rings, like many teens or kids did. I believe that because when I went to the cinema with my daughter to see the movie in the movie room were people at about 12-18 years of age and some couples, and was not full even on the movie premiere. Lord Of The Rings had and still has more fans and ' cut ' many many more tickets e.t.c and had better actors and director. In my opinion, the film was saved by the excellent performance by the two actors that I mentioned aboved, Jeremy Irons and John Malkovich and by the fans of C. Paolini's novel. If they decide to make a 2nd film they should be careful with the book's story and try a bit more, at least. Well done to those who worked hard and gave their best performances for the movie.",Eragon

It had believable, realistic actors who I thought I could relate to. They were very good at their roles. It had action and emotion to it - which is the kind of movies I like. If your not sure on whether to see it or not I would tell you to take a chance and go see it! I really liked it and I don't care what any one says because I'm entitled to my own opinion and I don't care what people say. I am my own person and do what I want. My parents really liked it and they are pretty tough on movies that they think are stupid but they loved Eragon. They said it was a great movie and that it was sweet. I think so too! I liked the book and had my ideas on what I pictured each person to look like and I thought they were pretty close. So just go and see it and I love this and will buy it when it comes out.

First of all if you are all going to compare Eragon to Lord of the Rings and Harry Poter than I'm comparing it to Robin Hood, Reign of Fire, Drgon Heart, Dragon Heart: A New Beginning, and Karate Kid. And Eragon is not another another version of Star Wars and Lord of the Rings. The movie was based on a New York best-selling novel. And people loved the story. Yes there were changes in movie but it was not a completely different story. The story was the same. Changes in the movie yes. But it was not a different story. Tell me how is the story different.

Things happened that did not make sense just to add to the action of the scene.I was deeply saddened by the outcome of this film. DEEPLY SADDENED...My prognosis: don't see the movie, unless you want to be disappointed.Comments about Eldest: if they are going to make this movie, I sure as hell hope they do a better job of it...

It was a good surprise. The movie, though, is not faithful to the book and lets us with a sensation of disappointment - a big disappointment - at the end. I think that someone who doesn't know the book would think that the original story is poorer than it really is. Another clear sensation that I had when I saw the movie is that they've changed the story to make it cheaper. Great cities became wooden villages, monsters became dirty humans, elves loose their characteristic ears, dwarfs disappeared etc. It would be better if they've waited to make a movie with more resources. I'm editing this comment now just to include an opinion of another user that is very good, although unrealistic: they should make another Eragon, what I'm sure would be a great deal, since I don't know, for example, if someone will buy a DVD of the Eragon I've seen.",Eragon
1208,skateanime,eragon,2,13 January 2007,"I went to the movie just the other day feeling very excited about finally getting to see it, and I have to say that it was a major let down. The CG was done fairly well but it differently could have been better. The script was just horrible, though it did include a lot of dialog from the book, it just wasn't up to par. The plot line was also rushed, so if you haven't read the book, most of the movie wouldn't make a whole lot of sense. Also they took liberation's on how characters should look which personally as a writer myself I would be pretty upset about that. The book is much better then the movie, and although its not the best book, the movie is by far a tragedy. I really don't recommend seeing this movie, unless you like pretty scenery and rushed plot lines.",Eragon

I did not have to worry about blood & gore and filthy language, and the plot was simple and sweet. Some might disagree that this is a good movie, but I think it's because they expected just those scenes when watching a movie about dragons, war, and magic. This movie proved to me that you can portray death without violence in a movie. You can show love without sexual content. I enjoyed the ""feel-good"" ending (we don't get movies like that often enough). My son felt like a hero when we walked out of the theater. Watching the main character grow from a boy to a man, and the magical relationship he has with the dragon made my heart sore. Kids will especially love it!",Eragon
1210,xbeexstingx,Meh,6,13 January 2007,"This was a well done flick. Great acting, pretty good effects, decent dialogue. Well done flick based on a book? Not so much. Because Paolini's novel is so long and elaborate, a less-than-two hour movie really didn't do it justice. I won't get into details, but there were many important scenes and dialogue exchanges missing and they kind of screwed up a lot of stuff. Devoted Eragon fans probably will be disappointed. If you needed a clearer picture, think not quite as bad as a TV movie, but not even close to the Lord of the Rings movie standards. I'd recommend a rental, so you can judge for yourself whether or not you want to watch it more than once.",Eragon

I have read the books and consider them to be very good, not great but very good. The movie failed to even try to follow the book. If it had been just a fantasy movie, I would have considered it a ""B"" movie. The movie left out characters and changed the personalities of the ones that were in the movie. The sequence of events were changed,etc. It didn't seem to be a movie based on the book. It was a movie that simply used the title of a book to lure people to see it. Saphira was the only redeeming character in the movie and one good character does not make a good movie.

I feel as if I wasted $16.50 tonight. I went in this movie hoping to see a book I loved come to life. Instead I spent my time trying to piece this jagged movie together. Yes, the book and movie are about a dragon and young man, and the names are the same, but that it. Just like the movie The End. Even with keeping to the time frame of a movie, there were so many important events and storie lines that were just not there. Don't watch this movie unless you have the book handy to use as a guide. If your one of those that likes very GOOD CG, then this movie is right up your alley.

The CG of this movie was able to give it a little life.",Eragon

At just over an hour and a half long, there was not enough time to successfully tell this wonderful story. The screenplay was unsatisfactory. The whole movie felt rushed, to try to get the story in, in the short amount of time. Movies will always leave some stuff out from the original story, but this left out way too much. I will now go back and read the book again, and try to forget that I ever saw the movie. Please, someone call Peter Jackson, and ask him to redo this movie...and save Christopher Paolini from humiliation. I hope that Paolini did not sign off on this movie.",Eragon

I mean come on...we all know that the movie almost never compares with the book. I have not read the book and was very entertained by the story. I certainly believe it was well worth the rice of two tickets, popcorn, and soda. And if and when there is a sequel I will certainly go and see that movie, too.",Eragon
1215,ramases67,Could have been so much more,4,22 March 2007,"I was so looking forward to this movie after I read Paolini's books. Huge disappointment. They were in such a hurry to get through the story that they left out way too much. The character development was non-existent. Everything that made the characters real and interesting was either left out completely or breezed over. Characters like the ra'zac, urgals, and Galbatorix were not the slightest bit scary, more annoying than anything. I was shocked at John Malkovich's performance. They should have just left him out altogether. Its a travesty that this movie was written so horrifically. It had the ability to be a blockbuster!",Eragon
1216,ermimo3000,It slaughtered the book mercilessly,1,15 January 2007,"The makers of this movie got everything wrong except the names of the characters, and even then not all the characters were used. i do believe that the only thing that kept me in the theater to watch the whole thing was the hope that it would get better but it didn't. The characters were described in the book very well and the ones in the movie looked nothing like they should have. Saphira had spines on her back and NO FEATHERS, the Urgals had huge horns sticking out of their temples, and the Dwarfs were not that tall. the testing of Eragon and Murtagh never happened and the Dwarfs underground city looked like it was built that day in a hurry, not like the masterfully crafted palace that it was in the book. These producers need to think very hard before making or even if they should make the next movie until they have fixed this one or apologized for ruining the book and making my head hurt!",Eragon
1217,onyxfur,Let down and mortified,1,15 April 2007,"I loved Rachel Weiz in this movie. Sorry if I spelled her name wrong. Jeremy Irons is awesome anyways. Murtagh's actor was pretty good too. But the rest of the movie almost made me walk out of the theater. I loved the books, and was expecting much, much more. Also, I was very upset that they revealed a big part of book two, Arya being an elf princess. That's a pretty big part of the second book. Yeah. I wasn't impressed.Arya? No pointed ears. Blond hair. Blue eyes. She has black hair and green eyes. Any similarities? No. I think it was screwy how Saphira suddenly seemed to name herself. Not cool. Murtagh was in, what, a minute total time at most of the film, when he's in over half of the book? Wow. I have to admit, very good special effects, props to them for those, but the writers could have done a much, much better job...Some more things I was looking forward to seeing. I very much wanted to see the fight scene between Durza and Eragon, the proper one where Arya and Saphira break through the sapphire, Eragon gets cut, and gets the vision of Oromis. Ladiada. You know the rest. Maybe the sapphire, that would have been nice. So much for recreating the book. All in all, I thought that that movie was beyond disgustingly mortifying to me, and I would not recommend seeing it. For those of you who haven't yet.",Eragon

1220,sierranighthawk2000,If they attempted to fail at least they accomplished that.,1,17 January 2007,"It is one thing to summarize a movie do to budget cuts and time restraints. IT is another to do so due to lack of creative ability. The blame does not only fall on the director but on the producers and the studios for hiring somebody with such limited imaginative ability the inability to think outside of the box; Especially when you have such a descriptive story line to follow. I would have expected this type of product mainly in the independent film side of production where they are limited to budget cuts and time restraints. A disaster, no I mean atrocity like this should have never happened.

Apart from the title and an approximation of the subject matter, it leaves out highly important details that are necessary to understand what is going on. Frankly, I am not altogether certain about how on earth the filmmakers are going to manage to make a second film from those dregs they call the first movie. It does, however, have some merit in that if it is watched as a send-off of the book, you may get a few laughs. I'm not trying to deliberately insult anyone's work but just hope that they redeem themselves with the second film or at least make another Eragon film that more closely follows the story.",Eragon

I HATED how soft Saphira voice was shes a dragon she should sound like a teenager. Joss Stone would of made a great voice for her. Ed Speleers acting was horrible. and Angela's part was cut down and she was one of the best people in the book.By the time you said oh OK i getting into it the movie jumps 10 chapters and goes right to the middle action. the skips some of the best action and with in 10 mins were at the end battle. i so glad my father payed for the movie. because it was NOT worth the 9 bucks.,Eragon

I was hoping that the director would have stayed true to at least part of the book. Here is a spoiler--If you are thinking about how the ending will be when Eragon kills Durza with the help of Arya, if you have read the book, it is absolutely nothing like the end! It completely leaves out some of the main characters and if there is to be a second movie about ""Eldest"" then I don't know how they will be able to tell the story (where was Roran in Eragon--he plays a huge part in the second book). All in all it was an okay movie, if I had never read the book. I mean, come on, Lord of the Rings stayed more true to the books than this movie.",Eragon

I have read the book and so i had a hard time with somethings that were different between the two. I think if you have not read the book you would think it was great! I have family that have not read the book and they all really liked the movie, so i think it depends on having read the book and whether you want them to stay completely true to the book.I am a person who likes to stay as close to the book as possible so sometimes I tend to be overly critical of movies. I just had a problem with the way they handled some of the character's entrances into the movie. And also the exit of one character.

I have recently rented it and watched it again, only to find it still makes me angry.Reasons why it's bad: -The acting is terrible. The movie seems like it's rushing through it. -If you hadn't watched the movies, you would probably be confused, because they don't really explain things.Reasons why it made me angry: -They don't even mention the dwarfs. -Supposedly in the movie, Saphira already knew her name. In the book, he had to go through a list of names until he came to one she liked. -They didn't mention the were-cat Solembum. -Angela was an old witch, not a beautiful, young sorceress. -Brom did not tell Eragon he was a dragon rider, and he certainly didn't tell him about Zar'roc. -there are many many more.Therefore: -If you've read the books, don't watch it because it will only make you angry. -If you haven't read the books, i wouldn't watch it because it would be a waste of your time.",Eragon
1226,moviemaker08,What happens when a former visual effects supervisor tries to direct an epic film?,4,30 March 2007,"Answer: a lackluster disappointment with superb CGI. Author Christopher Paolini said that he had always envisioned ""Eragon"" as a movie as he was writing it. Perhaps this vision made him too eager to sell the rights to his novel. I can see no other reason why he would have allowed his creation, which had the potential to be metamorphosed into an epic feature rivaling the ""Lord of the Rings"" trilogy, to instead be chopped and butchered into such a flat, unimaginative film. Had I not read the book prior to seeing the movie, I might have enjoyed it more. But I (as well as any other Eragon aficionado, I am certain) was cringing throughout the entire hour-and-a-half duration of this sorry attempt at bringing ""Eragon"" to the silver screen. Paolini's characters, dynamic and engaging in the book, were made unremarkable and uninteresting, if they were not omitted altogether. The plot deviated horribly from the book, becoming quite predictable, not to mention an embarrassment to the masterpiece from which it was loosely adapted. If Fox 2000 intended to produce screen versions of the entire Inheritance trilogy, they will find it near impossible to continue on to ""Eldest,"" seeing how many crucial elements were cast aside from the plot of ""Eragon."" Even if I had not read the book, I doubt I would have been able to follow the story, which seemed rushed and disconnected and lacked a sense of pacing.Having been impressed by the ""Eragon"" novel, I greatly anticipated seeing this film. But I was sorely let down. I expected a thrilling epic, and instead was given a painful 120 minutes of unrealistic dialogue, mediocre acting, unoriginal sets, and a broken-up but still predictable storyline. A visual effects supervisor should stay a visual effects supervisor, or at the very least, refrain from taking on such a vast project as Eragon for a first attempt at directing.",Eragon
1227,Dustymusicman,And i wanted so badly to love it...,2,21 January 2007,"Christopher Paolini's books (Eragon and Eldist) are among my two favorite recent reads. The story is fresh and compelling, the characters are intricate, real and captivating and the over all feel of the writing is fantastic. So of'course when I heard that they were translating these books to film I became extremely excited, with just a bit of fear that they would butcher such a wonderful story in an attempt to bring it to life on the screen. However I waited in anticipation for months and finally went with a group of friends to the nicest theater in town in hopes of a great film experience. Sadly, I was tremendously let down. The film lacked nearly everything that made the books so wonderful. The dynamic journey that Eragon must face went from being a months long trek through unparalleled danger to being a simple two or three day trip through the woods. Characters who are so complex and believable were portrayed as one dimensional, pop culture laden charatures. The voice of Saphria was the only redeeming part of the film (and actually the part I was most afraid I would despise because of the difficulty of having a creature who only speaks through telepathy as a main character) and the special effects were up to par. Again, as a reader of the books I was greatly confused by the decision to remove the pivotal moment when Eragon receives a nearly fatal wound from the shade and replace it with an overly cheesy ""near death"" moment for Saphira. This not only helps win Eragon a great deal of sympathy from an audience, as he must deal with his disability in the trials to come, but is also where the majority of the drama in the sequel derives from. There were many more points I could nit pick about but you can definitely get my point from this. If you think you would enjoy this story, please read the books - they are indeed fantastic and unless you are completely illiterate and can find no one to read the books to you, I would strongly recommend you avoid this film.",Eragon
1228,amanda71390,massive let down,1,21 January 2007,i hated the movie. my friend got me into the first book of the trilogy and i liked it so much i was there the day eldest came out to get a copy. when i heard the movie was coming out i was sooo excited. i blew off people to go with a few friends that were going to see it. a ton of people from my school were there just as excited. it was a massive let down. they left out a ton of stuff. key characters were barely mentioned and weren't introduced when they were supposed to be. durza just kept getting pastier and pastier every time we saw him which made him look super cheap. the voice over for saphira was definitely the best part. oh and the worst part was the battle at the end. what in the world was that stupid dark magic dragon. and what happened to arya bursting through the glass ceiling and the blessing of that one child. ya how are they supposed to make a second movie without her?? Angela was a joke. and where was the were-cat. i really think they should get a new director and some new actors new writers and redo the movie so they are able to make the second and third movies. oh and excuse me if this is out of line but when arya was on the table or w/e she seemed more like she was going through some sexual pleasure instead of being in pain.,Eragon
1229,FlyingXtreme,Better Then It Is Credited For,7,1 December 2008,"I have seen this movie many times, before reading the book and have enjoyed it completely. However, after reading the book recently, I will give that there was a lot taken away from the movie that I would have loved to have seen. It is a shame that certain things weren't added or changed, for whatever reason. They added to the plot in the book and would have made certain things in the movie make a bit more sense.That is not to say this movie was terrible, though. I thought the acting was amazing, effects breathtaking and wanted more when the movie ended. All in all, I thought the movie, before reading the books and now as a stand alone, was amazing.My advice if you are going to see this movie, don't compare it to the book. The movie will never measure up to the book, but it is great by itself. Honestly, if it wasn't for the movie, I might have never even picked up the book to begin with.",Eragon

I was irritated out of my mind watching it. If I hadn't read the book beforehand, I probably would have left the theatre confused. Either the director got forced into this project, and just didn't care how it came out; they didn't read the book before hand; or they were rushed through the movie. Honestly, if you don't notice you can see crew and equipment in the scenes, or that your characters not only don't fit their parts, but don't know what they're doing, then you DON'T need to be directing. This movie could have been so great, given the right people. I wonder if someone would do a remake- would that be too much of an insult? Who cares. Anyway, the point is that was a bad movie. I didn't like it. Do yourself a favour, read the books, then spend the money you would have used to see the movie on a drink. I was so disappointed.",Eragon

It doesn't completely follow the original storyline, although it should because some of the stuff they left out is extremely important. Some of the acting is CRAP like ""Angela"" she WAS CRAP and ugly too. I don't know how the hell she got the part. Jeremy Irons is pretty good. The person who plays Brom is rather harsh but that's good. He was a good actor at times. Saphira is okay although she somewhat irked me at times. This should be watch just for popular culture. Some of the acting is appropriate. The fighting could've been a tad more realistic.The special effects were amazing. Arya needed to be prettier because her character was DARK haired apparently. The setting was beautiful although slightly Lord of the Rings like. It wasn't a PARODY really, but more like a mini bit off of it.",Eragon
1232,Burn-Him,Worst book to movie transfer I have ever seen,1,23 January 2007,"This movie engenders the question: ""Did they even read the book when they made this movie?"". They left out so many key characters/events from the book that they 'shot themselves in the foot' for any hopes at a decent sequel. The book had the potential of 'Lord of the Rings' type fame. Instead, we got a hollow, fantasy, B-rated quality movie. Paolini's book has vivid characters a wonderfully detailed and involved story line that was completely ignored in the movie. Casting was horrible. The only character that they got right was Brom. Even Saphira was created with complete absence of mind regarding the description give by Paolini. They added characters that didn't even have a line in the book. What was up with Galbatorix even having a part? Not that John Malkovich did a bad job, but how much did they sacrifice in the plot to add what wasn't already there. The only hope for redemption would be a re-make where Paolini has total creative control. He should be ashamed to be associated with this movie. The third book better be freakin' awesome to make up for this travesty.",Eragon

I can understand them leaving a few things out of the movie but changing everything??? Now that's where i draw the line. Well at least my boyfriend liked it but only because the dragon was a really good actress. The things about the movie that bothered me most was Arya was not an elf which is like saying Harry Potter is not a wizard. There were way too many characters left out and the ones that weren't didn't even have lines, oh and it wasn;t really the best acting.

Mostly everyone agrees that the movie was a letdown, and briefly reiterating what was said, based on a terrible script, characters and towns being left out, characters not being portrayed accurately...the list goes on. The people that did see the movie that enjoyed it, are mainly made up of those that did not read the books. I can understand that not reading the books has a huge impact on how you enjoy a movie, but look at the movie as if it wasn't based on a book. The script was terrible, and cheesy at best, the acting...so so, and so fast paced if you blinked, you missed a major scene. The only good part about this movie, which everyone seems to agree on, is Rachel Weisz doing the voice for Saphira, and the special effects. That's it, the list ends there. For myself, a movie needs to be good in more areas that just two to make it enjoyable, but apparently there are some people that just need a good voice-over and some cool special effects with a lot of fire to be content. In most cases, I'm against remakes, because it's just some company trying to capitalize off of a really great film by doing it over again (in most cases). Eragon, however, falls into that small category of films that need a remake, because, when looked at overall, was a terrible film. If the same producers, director, and writers stay on to film Eldest, I'm pretty confident that they will find that the movie falls VERY short of what they project for accomplishments, by overall film attendance and sales.",Eragon

It'll be very difficult to understand what's going on, unless you have read the book and know what's coming. The relationship between Arya and Eragon was almost made out to be a love story, which is not what is there in the book. Brom is a character, well-played, but all the rest were not so accurately portrayed, i think. However, to say something in the movie-maker's defence, i believe that it was always going to be bit of a challenge, trying to bring Eragon and Saphira to life.

Except for Rachel Weisz as Saphira, Jeremy Irons as Brom, and Garrett Hedlund as Murtagh, none of the other characters seemed to be done right.

Indeed one would think that so much story in a time-frame of a movie would require lots of cutting of plot. But the Director has wonderfully kept to the story and the screenwriter dismissed some loose ends, that actually made the movie flow more.I give top marks to scenery, especially the use of wide camera angles with the use of panoramic circling of mountains. The Buildings bring out a feel of medieval times, and I am a sucker for medieval themes.The actors are chosen well.But most importantly, THIS MOVIE IS WELL WORTH THE VIEWING TIME.

All and all it is as if somebody read a short synopsis of the novel, decided to make up everything in between, ruin the brilliance of the plot, and make a short movie that when you are done watching it you feel as if you just watched the trailer for it.Almost everything left me seething mad that they would destroy such good literature with such a travesty of a movie... because now many people will judge Christopher Paolini's novels based on this pathetic excuse for an adaptation.",Eragon
1247,jmcknight14,A disservice to the author and the public,1,2 February 2007,"Having just finished reading this magnificent work of fantasy fiction, to say that I was disappointed would be a Massive understatement. It seems that Fox and the powers that be therein, decided to rewrite and commercialize this story beyond belief & beyond respectful limits. I feel truly sorry for Christopher Paolini, whose brilliant work was trashed, as if by Dragons' talons. The disappointment may not be so great for those of you who have not read the book; perhaps a small blessing. If you want to really enjoy this Epic tale, which, if presented properly should have been even more memorable than Lord of the Ring, do yourself a favor and read the book. I hope that this brilliant young author has not already made a deal with this studio for the next book""Eldest"". If he has, and the project is handled in the same way, we will have doubled the loss.

1248,andreascohen,Highly entertaining,9,12 June 2007,"In the spirit of Lord of the Rings, this movie delivers a highly entertaining tale. If you enjoy this type of story, this is for you. My advice would be to ignore the overly critical reviews on this site.Background: Eragon, based on the inexplicably popular by-the-numbers fantasy novel written by then-teenager Christopher Paolini. Ever wondered what Star Wars would be like transposed into a fantasy setting? Wonder no longer. The king of the realm, Galbatorix (John Malkovich), who exterminated the dragon riders at the beginning of his reign when he swept away the Old Republic, decides it's not a tradition he wants making a comeback, so he assigns his sorcerer/shade Durza (Robert Carlyle) to handle it.",Eragon
1249,marykat61,oh no,6,3 February 2007,When I read Eragon I thought that it would make a great movie. After watching this movie today I must say I am greatly disappointed. Why change so much and why leave out so much? The ending was so very wrong. How will you make a second movie without ending the first correctly? I am a big fan of Sci-Fi and Fantasy but this movie was all wrong from the start. I have also read the second book. If they make a second movie I hope it will follow the story line more accurately. I did enjoy the work of the young actor Edward Speleers as Eragon. As well as the voice of Saphira by Rachel Weisz. Brom had a much bigger part in the book and it would have been nice to see more of Jeremy Irons.,Eragon
1250,jmooney1214,WoW Just WoW this was horrible,1,3 February 2007,"I have read the book plenty of times, but this movie was horrible. It Sucked. I was really looking forward to it but it was Awful. THe actor that played Eragon Was horrible he had some of the stupidest lines ever. Saphiras voice was well done by Rachael Weiss but thats about it. Every one else sucked i watched this and about half way through i was disgusted. Did i mention that I didn't Like this movie at all. Anyway this movie completely ruined the book for me and probably ruined the entire series for me. they should stop making any sequels to this and cut their losses. I really hope that the good actors that did this movie like Jeremy Irons Only did this for the money because if they read the script then i am really disappointed in them because this movie was horrible.",Eragon
1251,bongolover93,don't look,2,5 February 2007,"This was terrible!!!! i loved the books(read them), they were the first book i read that were fantasy that i actually liked. And i was very excited when i heard they were making a movie about the first book. First of all, look at the harry-potter movies. they turned a 200 paged book into a 3 hour movie! Eragon was at least 500 pages...and the movie was only and hour and a bit. The whole movie took place in bout 3 days,Brom died in two, and magically-yes, magic- they made it through the desert in about a half a day. in the book, it takes about 6 months just for that one part! The movie also leaves key information out..if they make a second movie for it, it won't even be able to be called the ""inheritence"" series. They have messed things up so much! I asked other people about it that hadn't read the book and they said it sucked. So i am in the right. and then they also added in completely uncalled for things. Like,in the end, there is this black magic dragon! like what?! that wasn't supposed to happen!!!! I am glad to get it all out. the movie sucked!",Eragon
1252,nickyd43,Horrible,1,9 February 2007,"This movie was the worst remake I have ever seen. The plot was totally off, excluding major events in the movie that will need to be known in the second movie (if one is made). Many major characters didn't come into play at all or came in or went out in the wrong ways. It was totally different then the book and makes you want it to end. If you haven't seen this movie, then don't. It ruins the whole vision of what the book laid out for you. Good job for trying to work with what you were given, but it just didn't work out. The characters had a very sloppy performance, but the effects were good. I do not recommend for anyone to see it.",Eragon

1254,freaks101,"Movie was Boring, Wrong...Please Read",3,17 February 2007,"Alrite..everything that gave the book sense was left out in the movie. The acting sucked. Eragons house was supposed to be blown up spectacularly but all he found was Garrow lying under a small pile of twigs. Eragon looked freshly washed and clean in every part of the movie even if he was crawling about in dirt or if he was fighting urgals.Since when was the Razac stabbed by Brom? When did Brom sacrifice himself?? He enters the Varden and is welcomed like a long lost friend even though a huge army of Urgals is right behind him. Somehow Murtagh knows the exact way to the Varden and the Hardarac Desert is about the size of my backyard. Even if the movie makers can take some liberty, at least A FEW essential things should be like the book. This is just a small lists of mistakes in the movie. I'd like to write all the mistakes I saw but i have a life and I'm sure you all do. I thought the movie would be at least a little better than this bullshit. Sorry, I'm freakin disappointed. The movie would have been bearable if I hadnt read the book earlier. PS>I have to admit, the special effects were good and Brom acted well.",Eragon

SO, if you read the book and enjoyed it, i recommend that you should not go see the movie otherwise you're gonna see a whole new story made up with only a tinge of the real Eragon book.",Eragon

Should of picked someone who was known for making good movies and not picking up any noobs to do it. Mainly the problems i had was that the story line was horribly put together, it looked like it was obviously made up half the time. And I recommend any decent writer to steer clear of this company because they honestly didn't know wtf to do with the money they were given to do this movie. I would of rated this a negative number but the vote wont go that low.",Eragon

The things that disappointed me were, many scenes happened in the wrong places, different places and characters were completely left out, and I couldn't tell which were the Elves, or the Urgals (which were just mean looking men with face paint on). I don't think the director even read the book! If you haven't read the book, the bad acting, corny script, horrible cuts between scenes, inability to follow the story, and the boringness and simplicity of it all most likely will ruin it for you. The only two good things about it were Saphira (good acting) and the special effects, which weren't THAT good even. So, if you're not a little kid who doesn't care what he sees, AVOID this movie, it's not even worth renting.",Eragon
1258,linussokranus,It has nothing to do with the book.,1,12 February 2007,"The film Eragon has nothing to do with the book Eragon. The only thing they have in common is that there names are the same. The first things that are wrong is that the characters have the wrong appearances, and that there personality is also wrong. Take Saphira for an example in the book she never follows orders blindly as does in the film, when for example Eragon wants to go and save Arya but both Brom and Saphira that it's dangerous. But then Eragon says ""Well I'm the Rider and I say we go!"" And then Saphira OBEYS! If that would have happened in the book she would have knocked some sense into him, sense in mind she is both older and smarter than him.Plus the story in the book is that Eragon tries to hunt down the Ras'Zak to take revenge for his uncle but in the film they are going straight for the Varden.And though both elves and dwarfs are supposed to be in the story they make no real appearance. Sense the dwarfs are as long as a human and elves has no pointy ears.In short the film has nothing to do with the book except by name only.",Eragon

Let me first of all say... what a good way to ruin some good books. Nothing was right. The only thing that I can see a similarity in is the character names. Thats about it. Oh yeah, and how Sapheria buries Brom. I was really disappointed in the movie. They fast forwarded about 95% of the book, and included stuff that didn't happen. I hope that, if they decide to make a movie on the second book that they do things differently. They left out the dwarfs! They are so crucial to the plot, and they weren't in the movie. Neither was any mention of the elves. AHHHH!!! Now all I can do is wait for the second movie to come out, and hopefully they will compensate for the skipped scenes. But I need the third book.",Eragon

I hate reading books, but as soon as the movie was over, I got my butt to Hastings and bought Eragon AND Eldest. I'm still (slowly) reading Eragon, and it's much better, and VERY different. I'd say, don't see the movie if you haven't read the books. Read Eragon before watching it. It'll make the book a lot better for you. Besides, you'll have a wrong perspective when reading the book after watching the movie, and you'll want to read the book after watching the movie. But it's so off, it shouldn't even be called Eragon....",Eragon
1261,Spencerfarrington,Where was the director?,1,14 February 2007,"This movie, if it could be called that, contained no evidence that a director was present. The word ""dialogue"" means nothing apparently. There is no visual dynamic, only cuts from terrible close ups and mediocre medium shots, to establishing scenes with epic music. If I wanted just to look at scenery, I would take a vacation. If I wanted to listen to music, I'd stay at home. The movie deviates from the book excessively but then depends on the viewers' knowledge of the book, because having read the book is the only way to know what could possibly be going on. The acting only reflects how little the director actually got involved in this film. Anybody with eyes could see how bad it is from the outset. If you want a good laugh at a really bad movie, go see Eragon.",Eragon

After reading the books I can say the following: Considering that this was Edward Speleers' first movie I think he did an OK job - with a little bit of training he could (I think) one day rival some of our best known stars. And then of course they left a lot out of the movie that they had in the book. Yes I understand that they couldn't have everything that was in the book in the movie, but I'm sure they could have done A LOT BETTER!!! It's a travesty what they did to the author's hard work!! You immediately get the feeling (even without reading the books) that the Director and his team did a rush job. They left things out that should have been in and vica versa. Yes they didn't have Peter Jackson's LOTR budget but is this really the best they could come up with????? Oh, and why could they not wait until ALL THREE books were written and published before making the movies?",Eragon

I could have written a better storyline... The movie destroyed and did no justice to the characters esp Angela who is my favorite character. They way the book describes Farthen Dur and Teirm I mean the whole point behind making a movie is to bring the characters and places to life and they failed. The movie should be discarded and redone. I hope they don't do another one cause all they will do is make it worse. They should take the money they plan to spend on the sequel and use it to remake the first.,Eragon

The book and the movie are like 2 almost completely different stories and after reading the second book, Eldest, I can't even see how they're going to continue because some of the information in the movie is wrong in a way that it completely changes the story line and yet some important and vital information is left out completely. I extremely recommend reading the books. They were extremely enjoyable and worthwhile. As for the movie, I would like to watch it again just for a comparison as to what I thought of it when I first saw it, to now after reading the book.

I know that the majority of the readers were disappointed in the movie and the ones that weren't probably didn't read it well or are just easy to impress. and the enemies that aren't human were men with make up very disappointing the director better not try and make eldest and if so nobody should watch it was a disappointment and i would hate to see how they show an epic battle again. not very well done at all. that is why i despise what you did you lazy director.",Eragon

The movie cuts out half of the plot and characters. It was cheaply made, and did not follow the book very well. The actors did okay with what they had to work with, and the dragon was well done. Overall they should have just saved their money. I don't see how they could make a sequel to the movie based on the production of this movie. I say save your imagination and wait for the third novel, Christopher Paolini knows what he is doing and won't let you down.",Eragon

I am not normally one who comments about movies, but this, this... crappy piece of film strip really made me... griped. The narrator was so terrible, and Saphira's voice needed some touch up. Maybe make it a bit more echo-e? So, nothing is good about it. Okay, the actors are good to look at, but are not good at acting. Where is REALITY in this cursed film (okay, its a fantasy, but even they need some sort of normality)? Next time they should actually READ the book, and find out about how people react when a very odd thing happens, say, the hatching of a dragon. I mean, it isn't something you see everyday, is it? So why did Eragon just smile and move CLOSER? And in battle, you loose the bleeping arrows before the swordsmen clash with each other. You don't want to kill one of your own, do you?

It was so terrible- the most important things were just 'deleted', not mentioned, all the things that made the book so great... the story by Paolini was worth more than retelling to the screen as a most non-magical story ever told.

My point is this movie shouldn't be allowed to itself Eragon!!!When it comes to acting it terrible, horrible. Edward Speleers dosn't fit as Eragon, he is too elegant for that roll, and he isn't a good acter, like the rest of the characters in the movie.The movie was too short! You cant put 600 pages in just a 104min long movie! Whatever you do don't watch this film, it ruins the book, it completely destroyes the book.

1270,joseph-ike,"Faithful to the book - Superbly Animated Saphira - But, An Average Movie",7,10 April 2007,"'Eragon' the movie follows the book pretty faithfully, and as is expected, 2 hours is far too less time to cram in everything the author intended to depict with the book. The movie follows the adventures of a young farm lad, Eragon who comes across a dragon egg magically transported to him by an elf, Aria. How Eragon and his dragon, Saphira are linked by strong mental ties and how they must evade the cruel emperor Galbatorix in order to reach the good rebels, the Varden in order to lead an uprising against the emperor form the crux of the story. Ed Speelers as Eragon is predictable on most occasions and does not do justice to the boyish nature of Eragon in Paolini's masterpiece. Jeremy Irons plays his part as Brom to perfection and is quite a class apart from the rest of the cast. Saphira however is voiced exquisitely and the movie is a joy to watch on a big screen for the sheer effort put into animating the dragon. Sadly, the rest of the movie does not do justice to her. All in all, a good film to watch if you are a fan of the Eragon series, or if you like fantasy adventures of the LOTR genre. Watch with realistic expectations and the movie shouldn't let you down. I'd give it a 7 on 10 just because I loved the book so much and really wanted to watch the movie.",Eragon

What is the point of the film to have a dragon if you kick out out or twist on most of the other fantasy characters. I thought Urgals have horns and were the bloody hell are the dwarfs???

For instance Garrow actually dies at Horst's house and in the movie he actually dies when Brom throws a torch onto the pile of wood. And in the book it describes Brom as a old man, because he uses a cane and has a gray beard, yet in th Movie he is young and agile. and it seems like the only thing that changed is the lighting i saw absolutely no weather changes. I know it sounds like i am trashing this movie, but truly I'm not I'm just stating the things that could have helped it.I truly hope that they make a ""Eldest"" movie so i can see what that turns out like because they end of the movie with Galbatorix slashing away the map and a dragon being hidden behind it was a really suspense full ending.",Eragon

Sure it was obvious that it was written by a child and that the story was inspired by other famous fantasy novels however, it remained thoroughly re-readable.Whoever made the film clearly took the book, tore it up, burnt it, scattered the ashes on a table and only then did they try to read it and make a film out of it. The actor who plays Eragon has too many odd facial expressions that is totally irritating. Galbatorix has this line about being upset that he doesn't have his ""stone"". I laughed out loud in the theater when he said this. It was utterly ridiculous. I agree with the other guy that Galbatorix and Brom were casted appropriately and that important characters were cut from the movie.I truly hope that there will be no movie for the second book ""Eldest"" unless great changes are made: acting classes for ""what's his name"" playing Eragon for one, a screenwriter who actually read the book for another.The movie put the book to shame.",Eragon

While Hollywood abuses its power to take any story and turn it into what *they* ""think"" is a winner, this is clearly TOO MUCH! The movie does not explain itself in any regard, or lay out any rules, it simply forces you to ""accept"" whatever they put in front of you, therefore leaving out any: Character development (flat, unevolving and plain stick-man characters that make no sense and have no back stories), Timeline (there is no mention as to when, where, or even why this evil emperor took over, leave alone explain how!), Consistency (First they run for their lives to one side of the map, the next second the ""hero"" defies his companion and flies the other way to save someone he does not know and we never understood why he felt responsible, next thing you know his companion -that rode by horse at apparently the same speed as this dragon flies- is just in time to jump in and take the blow to save the hero and of course die honorably. Ridiculous just doesn't say it).I love fantasy stories, RPGs, novels, history... But I intensely dislike having my intelligence insulted... I pity Jeremy Irons to have to put a straight face to the camera with the lines that were given to him. The director thought that he could hide his inexperience and lack of combat-scene creativity behind many helicopter-go-around shots of great valleys and mountains. The actors had it easy as they start and end with the exact same face, given absolutely nobody undergoes ANY emotional situations, it seems. Settings and dressings are childish and narrow-minded, cloaking behind some weird conception of ""exotic"".Characters are thrown around with no explanations, back stories, motives or feelings (for example, the random cousin that is introduced only to soon leave and be completely unimportant. Or the mysterious savior that is the son of someone bad, whom we don't hear anything about except ONE SINGLE line at the end of the movie).The whole ""gather my army and attack"" thing is ludicrous: This kind has his own dragon, why didn't he go kill the baby dragon by himself? If he knew there were traitors in those mountains, why did he never bother to look for them properly? And the army... it storms into the fortress of the freedom fighters, but it magically disappears when the big-bad-mage is killed? I have not read the book. I am honestly not intending to, because I doubt the written creativity of a 15 yo that did not bother to revise his works until the next book is going to impress me much.Stay away from the movie, however, because it is only you and me that can push Hollywood to realize that WE are the market and WE will demand quality for the products we buy!",Eragon

The actors did the best they could but I don't agree that Rachel's voice was suited for Saphira- sounded way too much like a fairy princess and also, Saphira is a dragon not a pigeon (what's up with the feathers?). Ed's hotness almost outweighed his inexperienced acting, (I mean, come on, school plays cannot prepare you for a multi million dollar Blockbuster flick) but not quite. Also, Arya didn't look anything like an elf (she didn't even have pointy ears!). And Angela had limited clothing. The sets resembled LOTR and there is a fundamental problem with both the book and the movie- Brom resembles Ben Kenobi from Star Wars in every way imaginable (think about it). Some of the best characters are missing and they have damaged the plot so beyond repair that a sequel would be stupid, yet admittedly desirable (the pathetic attempt at one would give us all a laugh).

If this was what happened to the movie then I would have been disappointed that it did not follow the book, but instead I -would have- enjoyed it as a stand alone movie/story.The problem was that this waste of time did not even have a plot, story line, or logical meaning. It was just a bunch of scenes that when put together made no sense at all. If I had never read the book it would still have been a real stinker. If you look at the box office receipts you'll see what I mean. I feel sorry for the author and I would love to see a real director get a hold of this and do it right.

It's as though the screenwriters only read a few chapters, or perhaps just the description on the back of the book and then went to town writing a horrible script. This movie is completely different than the book and the book is so very good. I highly recommend the books to anyone who loves a good epic fantasy and I discourage anyone from watching this movie unless they're expecting it to be what it is - bad and nothing like the book! I really hope at some point in time they'll decide to redo this movie and actually base it on the books and stay as close to the books as possible. The story of Eragon (book, of course) is an incredible, fantastic adventure filled with many different settings, events, characters, and a very interesting plot among other things. The fact that this movie is supposed to be based on such a magnificent story seems like an insult to say the least!!!!!!!!!!",Eragon
1279,Nacachemohmk,The egg of the dragon!!!! And the dragon talk!!! Definitively a disappointment,1,27 June 2007,"Well, I love the movies of the genre of action and adventure, the mummy 1 & 2, The Pirates of the Caribbean from Jerry B. film, etc. I am reading the newspaper, the film section. WOW! Eragon! The movie of dragons! I think in the dragon effects of Harry Potter or many movies.In the cinema, the begin is good, Eragon find the medicinal capsule (or a egg). Suddenly! The unexpected happen, the marble broken and the dragon birth, oh, the baby.Bah! The dragon grow, now is a ""SHE DRAGON"" with a voice of actress model. Now Eragon discovered his powers of mega supreme dragon!. Dragon Eye, Dragon Ear. The battle begun. After all, the last battle, a battle neither in slow motion you can understand. The final ""Eragon n' the dragon lived happy forever.Bah! Money wasted.",Eragon
1280,silverdafencer,It doesn't follow the book...,4,28 March 2007,"The actors did an excellent job for the roles they played. But the storyline? Come on! That was not close enough to the book. I understand that you need to condense the book down for a movie, but they condensed it too much. They took out to many important characters, and they twisted the plot. Yea. Its about Eragon and how he finds the dragon Egg and it hatches into Saphira and how he turns into a dragon rider...etc but there's also other stuff going on besides that. They messed up the book, if you loved the book, you won't love the movie. If you haven't read the book, well then you'd probably like it if your into fantasy and dragons.",Eragon
1281,pcargo1,Not as good as the book,5,29 March 2007,"I read the book before seeing the movie, which I think, is the wrong order. Sadly, the two have very little in common. While the movie was OK, it lacked a lot of depth and background that made the original story so rich. The book was excellent. I am sorry that this talented young author had the bad fortune to be associated with this movie. It had the potential to be almost as good as Lord of the Rings. What was there was good, it just lacked a lot of...everything. This was kind of the ""Dragnet"" version, just the facts... Where were the side stories, the suspense, the training, the relationships, the feelings? It did not give you the feeling that the story was about a life threatening struggle, just an adventure. But give Hollywood a few years and they will remake it anyway. I hope the sequels are better and that they are not spoiled by this one.",Eragon
1282,birthexperiences,Really Not That Bad,7,1 April 2007,"Granted I had absolutely no interest in seeing this movie at all. In fact I thought it was going to be mindless drivel. If it weren't for my 3 year old son seeing it being played a store and becoming entranced I never would have given it a second thought.Now, having seen it about twice a day in the past eight (quite literally) and rushing out to buy the book and burning through it. Yes, it's not that bad. It has some charm to it and as of yet I'm not ready to claw out my eyes and stuff my ears with cotton like so many other of his ""favourite"" movies.Eragon has a charm to it although as a die hard Star Wars fan (the original trilogy, people, please!) I immediately started seeing the references, more so in the movie than the book (the book is more Tolkien I find). The actors are not to blame, though I do find John Malkovich lacking in emotion yet again. I'm sorry I do adore the man, but he plays one type alone and his monotone is getting tired. I think the problem was in script adaptation and direction more than anything.Still, I find myself eager to purchase the second book in the Inheritance Trilogy and wondering if there is a sequel in the works.",Eragon
1283,DemonHunter_7,A discrimination compared to the book!!,3,1 April 2007,"There are so many words I could say about a movie that's falls between dirt and hell. I pity Christopher Paoilli for having a movie business turn his beautiful work to repulsive revolution of book to movie screening. I am a student in Yr12, 18yrs of age and seeing something of which I looked so forward to, turn to ash right in front of me. Normally I'd not criticize and go on of all that disheartened me but these must be said to show how much manipulation has gone through turning a magical world inside out.1. The Urgals!! What happened! They are creatures with horns and larger then human life. Cheap! 2. Saphira's wings! They are not feathered they are membranes like bats! 3. ERAGONS TRAVELS LASTED TWO DAYS!!! PAHH 4. Arya is dark haired not blonde! Such a copy off Narnia with the White Witch! And she looks too old for the part! 5. Eragon's learning of magic through Brom. Far to quick paced. 6. King Galbatorix is not meant to show him self in the first movie, he needed not a face yet, maybe just a shadow. 7. Saphira did NOT grow in an instant!! 8. Too many one-liners! Sure this book can be enjoyed by kids to but having the story been turned into an absolute child's play, play school fairy tale is an out rage! The director should have read the book before hand because it's not his story line to manipulate, its Christopher's, a matter of fact, all the actors should have done so. Rachel Weisz as the voice of Saphira the dragon made a good effort, its sad her childish script limited her.Look, I love this story as if myself was involved with its story line but this is a great disappointment. Harry Potter even had the better of turning book to screen, even though it had a lot of bad reviews.Christopher Paoilli, please if you read this, I know its eye widening to see your characters come to life and colour, but please, this movie MUST be re-filmed with better actors, director and its needs you by its side to include all the valuable scenes lost in the making of the first. If it must be done, break the movie into two for financial matters, so the special effects can stay clutched closer to the book's storyline such as Gil' Eda. Saphira was great but the Urgals...? Please re-make this movie I beg, or many of your fans and book readers; as these comments here show, will not be at rest. It's heartbreaking to see your work be discussed harshly by many through the movie, but it's not your fault. Let there be no sequel till the first is fixed.I'll always love your work but please, fight against this.",Eragon
1284,revclare,how bad can a movie be?,1,2 April 2007,A great book butchered by a terribly written screenplay. Totally lost the plot and the heart of the Paolini's book(s) and made a movie that should be thrown away. The character of Arya was lost. The character of Roran was so minimized that there is no basis for his development in the second book.Was Paolini given any say in how his book was adapted?The character of Brom was watered down to nothing. Eragon himself was nothing compared to the book. I blame the writer. He should find another line of work.I can only hope that the next attempt to put this or these books on screen will give due respect to the books!,Eragon
1285,heretoannoy93,Terrible. Did the movie even read the book?,1,3 April 2007,"It ripped off the book. It was a total disgrace to it. Christopher Paolini I would almost guarantee is about to sue the movie producers. It was that bad. Everything was wrong - from the color of Arya's hair, to Brom, the fighting scenes, the villages, everything. I went in to the movie theater knowing it would not be good, considering movie reviews and friend recommendations, but I had to see it for myself. I almost cried. It was one of the worst movies I have ever seen - and no, I am not exaggerating. Even without reading the book, which I have and loved, it was still a horrible movie between the actors portraying the characters, the rating, the music, and the effects. Having read the book, on top of the horrible movie to begin with, and since the movie directors and writers did not even read the book, it was a horrendous movie. There was only one village scene, the fighting was extremely fake, and they added in things and took out things that should not have been messed with - especially Arya. The war scenes lasted only 5 minutes, and they were so fake and even if it had okay special effects, they were uncalled for special effects. and it was just terrible. The twins were barley in the movie, if they were in it at all, and they never portrayed the importance and significance of the egg, and its background. They effects of the dragons were very well done, but it does not even come close to being able to just erase all the other mishaps because they got one thing right. The other thing that really made no sense about the movie was the length. How can you turn a 556 page book into about an hour and a half film? It just does not make any sense. I am not sure what happened with Stefen Fangmeier (director), as he has helped make a few good movies in the past, but this one is definitely his worst movie by far in my opinion. It was his first time directing a movie himself, and I think he needs to go back to doing visual effects, because that was the only strong point in the movie. I am not sure that Peter Buchman (screenplay writer) even read the book, as the movie was so far off from the book. He does not have much experience, having only written for Jurassic Park 3 and a few upcoming films. The cast is only somewhat well known, with a few new actors, but other than that the cast was a decent group, but they are better than Eragon, I can tell you that. I cant exactly say how bad it is, it just is. It is terrible whether you have read the book or not. My advice is that if you have seen the movie and not read the book, and you are thinking well if the movie is terrible the book must be to, to actually read the book because it is a wonderful piece of literature, unlike the book which is a disgrace to media. If you have read the book and seen the movie, and love the book and hate the movie, ignore the movie and give the advice I am giving. If you love the movie, then thats your opinion. If you love the movie and have not read the book however, read the book, and if you still love the movie, it is still your opinion.",Eragon
1286,amanda-buck,what were they thinking?,3,4 April 2007,"I was beyond ecstatic when I first learned that they were making the book into a movie. After reading the book, I thought this would make a great movie. Little did I know that I got my hopes up, only to be severely disappointed. Most people know that book to movie translations rarely, if ever, give the book any justice. But after seeing what Peter Jackson did with Lord of the Rings and how well the Chronicles of Narnia: The lion, the witch and the Wardrobe...I assumed it could be done. Obviously...I was wrong. After numerous discussions with others who have read the book, I found out I was not the only one who felt this way. It was too rushed. I understand that there is a lot of detail in the book, but there was no justice in Saphira's transformation or their journey across Alagaesia. The scene with the Varden...don't get me started. Where are the Twins, the training, and where did the giant black thing Durza conjure come from. Seriously! Even for those that have not read the book...it is a mediocre movie. I'm just sadly disappointed I wasted my money!",Eragon
1287,redryan,"OK, its not bad",8,8 April 2007,"This movie did go at a quick pace and missed a lot of the novel. But face it, it has a LOT of potential to be a great game and movie. Face it, if they included everything, then the movie would be about over 3 hours long. I sure wouldn't want to sit through that even it it was amazing. The only things that really bothered me was the DEAD RA'ZAC?? I mean WTF is wrong with the movie makers!?!? That and Arya, isn't she supposed to be an ELF? And she TOLD us she's a PRINCESS, I mean, we're not supposed to know that until we find out she's the Elf Queen's Daughter! Then they didn't put emphasis on Eragon's wound from Durza, which is quite important in this series. GAH!!! OK, that's my attack. The acting was decent, other than Galbatorix. He should never have been chosen. He shouldn't even have been included in the movie actually, he has a very minor role in the first two books. Arya is hot, Eragon is an ignorant child. It wasn't bad.",Eragon
1288,rprotz,Eragon,8,9 April 2007,"People who read the book, give this movie a horrible rating, but for those who enjoy movies of Myth, Magic, Dragons, and heroes, then ignore what you read.Some enjoy the book and expect the movie to have the same work or plot or content, thus spoiling their experience. For the rest of the movie goer world, who would rather watch a movie than read a book, I thought the film had all the contents of a good movie that I would enjoy to watch again.This movie has the action it needs to carry you thru the movie. Most movies I see are predictable, not so with this one (not having read the book).From what I have read if they followed the book, this movie may have been over 3-4 hours long. Most movies do not make it with that type of length except for those rare ones.Don't get me wrong, book readers have their imaginations mixed with the writers words, they each see images in their mind differently so Hollywood may disappoint them and they are entitled to their opinions because of it.But if you enjoy ""Hollywood Magic"", Lord of the Rings series, or Willow, then please give the movie a try. I only wish I saw this in the movie theater or IMAX would have been quite a joy.",Eragon
1289,xxdaimpforuxx,totally agree,1,17 April 2007,yes u totally agree with you..from the bad acting to the poor costumes it was really a let down. I myself am a Inheritance Trilogy fan and it was a great disappointment to me. It had weird awkwardness feeling between Saphira and Eragon and the character development between them is very awkward....The costumes as i mentioned very cheesy especially the last scene. Furthermore there were mannyy and i mean many scenes such as famous cities that were not in the movie which really disappointed me. I think the worst part was the ending...especially the ending which i shall not reveal but for those who have seen the movie...it just totally killed me and my intentions of watching Eldest...if it is ever made,Eragon
1290,dolphins_sparkle12,"The Movie ""Eragon"" was not good.",2,7 June 2007,"My sister recently told me to read the book ""Eragon"" first, before I saw the movie. So I have, I'm not quite finished with the book yet, but what i've seen from pictures and previews of the movie, it's NOTHING like the book. What really angered me was that 'Arya' was supposed to look exotic and have long, dark hair. Also she was described as kind of fragile and petite. Brom doesn't look as old as they describe him in the book, and I haven't seen any pictures or previews of the different non-existent creatures that play a big part in the book, therefore they should be in the movie. Maybe I'll become a film-maker and direct my own ""Eragon"" movie. As my rebuttal, 'Roran' and 'Eragon' are both very good-looking, in the movie.",Eragon
1291,horserider2909,"An awful, badly-casted, wanna-be Lord Of The Rings film",1,23 April 2007,"I have to say, this was was absolutely awful. I had previously read both of the current books that have been released from the 'Inheritance' trilogy, and thoroughly enjoyed them both. However, i think this film really let me down.The characters, were extremely badly casted - the main character of Eragon, the actor could barely act to save his life. I think the only characters that didn't disappoint me, was Ajihad and the voice of Saphira.The storyline was very loosely picked up, a lot of important details missed out. Had no sense of culture or history like the book did. Did not like how Brom was played across either - he didn't seem to have as much importance as he did in the book.Fans will be disappointed.",Eragon
1292,jgsm,Waste of time,3,4 May 2007,For the younger fantasy fans this could probably be something. But nevertheless this film is really bad. The dialogs are just a joke. The fact that the film-technique and some of the scenes is really beautiful just becomes sad when you notice that they missed to create any feeling in the film. I wonder as well how this movie managed to attract such actors as John Malkovich and Jeremy Irons. Gah i wonder why i even bother commenting it. The delivered their parts especially Malkovich. Guess it's like in all movie-trends Aliens/dinosaurs/environmental disasters and asteroids that films produced drops more and more in quality as people in Hollywood just wants to suck the last drop of income out of the genre after a big hit. Dull movie!!,Eragon
1293,jawycoco,Terrible Movie,1,28 April 2007,"This was a terrible movie. The only redeeming part was when Saphira was a baby dragon and couldn't really talk...well, couldn't talk period or think telepathically. The only other factor that made the movie fun was the fact that Saphira was actually cute as a baby and wanted to make you have a pet dragon. The acting was atrocious, the ending was nonsensical, and overall it was a terrible movie. I would recommend never watching this movie unless you're extremely, and I mean extremely, bored and would like to laugh at the horrendous acting. And as for John Malkovich, what was the point of his character? Extremely lame.",Eragon
1294,samphillis,Ghey,3,8 May 2007,Special Effect Were Great i liked the idea with the feathered wing! Other than that AWFUL!! don't waste you money acting is appalling i mean they could have made it a 3 hour blockbuster worthy of lord of the rings recognition but the just messed it up with pathetic storyline and crap voice acting Yeah that's right i personally though Rachel Weiz's Accent was shocking its like she was meant to sound British but kept on forgetting to do the accent brom wast how i imagined him but he was still pretty good but Ed Speelers..... AAAAAAHHH! the gruesome amount of cheesy lines!!! and he bosses saphira around all the time i thought they were meant to be equals and where tierm and dras leona and that big ruby thing that saphira smashes at the end of the book when she breathes fire for the first time THE FIRST TIME!!!! i mean you got to agree its frustrating.,Eragon
1295,dlcrn1128,Movie,6,12 May 2007,"Okay, of all the comments I have read they seem to forget that this is a KIDS movie. I do not think it is meant to be a competitor to Lord of the Rings, but rather entertainment. I agree the books are much better, however, I still enjoyed the movie and ma looking forward to the sequel. It may not have all the same elements of the book but I am still looking forward to it. My grandsons enjoyed the movie very much and it was easy for them to follow. If the movie had followed more of the book it would not have been possible for them to see the movie. I do look forward to the sequel and am also looking forward to the final book of the trilogy.",Eragon
1296,henrydsj,"Movie Sux, Changes Storyline too Much. Like Sex and Tuna...Don't go.......................",1,18 May 2007,"This movie was a huge letdown. The book goes through and explains things. The movie doesn't. The movie covered about 200 pages in about 10 minutes, literally skipping forward 30 pages, back 20. I mean I can understand leaving out minor ""story fluff"" but they left out the story. In order to follow the movie, even the smallest amount, you must know the book. The movie looks so corny if you have read the book, and if you haven't then it makes no sense. I mean if you were to make a movie from a book at least make them similar. This movie changes Eragon from being arrogant with magic to smart on his second try. It just changes so much, it's crap. My parents just couldn't understand why I was smacking my lips, sighing, and shaking my head whenever I watched it. I only say this movie because it was sussposed to be like the book.Yeah.... Well...Typo..... To sum it up the the two story lines are like SEX and TUNA",Eragon
1297,knnywood364,The Worst I've Seen in a While,3,18 May 2007,"There are two types of movies based on novels; those that follow the storyline closely, and those that don't. Unfortunately for any reader of the book Eragon, this movie is the second. I could understand if the movie was running long and some material had to be cut out, but this movie was only about an hour and a half long, leaving, in my opinion, plenty of time to add more story. If the viewer has not read the book, this could be incredibly confusing. Many times during my viewing of the movie I heard people asking each other what had just happened. Also, the ending was dramatically different, and a few characters near the end were completely skipped over. On the plus side, the effects in this movie were good, along with the set design. But overall, I would not recommend this movie.",Eragon
1298,msllucasgrabeel,It could have been worse.,6,20 May 2007,"Okay, sure it wasn't half as good as the book, but as a movie... I'm not quite sure.Lets focus on the positive for a bit. The voice of Saphira, who's name escapes me, was stunning. It was just like I'd thought it would be. The scenery was really beautiful, as some of you have said before. The CGI was cool, I loved the final fight scene when they're with the Varden. The choice of actors was good, but the script was, admittedly, rubbish. The film seemed very rushed and loads of it was missed out. And the urgals, what was going on there? Urgals are supposed to have horns, and Galbatorix was barely in it. Most of the characters weren't in it as much as they should of been. Yet to me they looked the part. If you don't compare it to the book, then it's an okay movie. Sometimes you don't have to analyse it to death. It reminded me of Stormbreaker in the fact that it could have been at least an hour longer and they still missed out huge chunks of the film. It really bugs me.Oh and will everybody stop calling Christopher Paolini's work a children's book. It makes it sound like it's written for five year olds. Which it's not. Read the book as well as watching the film and then fill little bits in.I love Murtagh! Jo xxx",Eragon
1299,scottrnichols-1,Good Movie as movies go,10,3 August 2007,"I haven't read the book, and I think that's good because my review is about a movie not a book or it's adaptation. So as a movie, I really enjoyed it. I keep reading these strange reviews from fans of the book, and honestly, unless the book is completely different, you'd think they didn't like the book either. I recommend it. I found it entertaining and the story was interesting. I really hope that they make a sequel because I would be very interested to see where the story leads. I'll leave the books on the shelf for now and enjoy my movies! I say watch it for good entertainment! If you're looking for Harry Potter or even Lord of the Rings, then go rent them, because who wants to watch cheap rip offs anyway. If you watch this movie as a movie of it's own, then you'll definitely enjoy it.",Eragon
1300,leeniblett-2,The film was bad but compared to the film it was terrible,3,24 May 2007,"I have read the two books relating to the film and had read Eragon prior to watching it. The film just seemed to lose a lot of book contained with changing major plot points and completely removing characters.With some of the characters that were included e.g. Murtaug, Agihad and Angela they shrank the contribution to barely minor character, Angela's character was reduced to a cameo.The script lost much of the story and changed many of the direction Eragon was heading in in the book.I do not see how they can now do a sequel (if it made enough money) as the ending places the characters in different places and certain characters not even appearing e.g. the twins.The only redeeming features of the film are Rachel Weisz's voice of Saphira, the design on Saphira and Jeremy Iron's role as Brom who did a great job with the role.",Eragon
1301,The-Alchymist,Could of been great...,1,27 May 2007,"I haven't read the book so I cant comment about it. The movie could of been great but it advanced to quickly, from the growth of Saphira (Someone said it was ""magic"" that made her grow so fast, somethings just shouldn't be so easily explained), the rescue of Arya (Kind of retarded in my opinion... the girl tells you to rescue her and you run off just because of that) and the death of Grom (How the hell did he get there so fast?!). It felt like the whole time-line of the movie from start to finish was a week. The acting was below average (WHAT IN GOOD GODS NAME WAS JOSS STONE DOING THERE?! I MEAN HONESTLY). On the other hand Robert Carlyle & John Malkovich performance was partly Commendable(Maybe because the other actors were so bad... they shone amongst them)even though Malkovich wasn't shown very often. The CGI was fantastic, beyond belief and very convincing, their budget did the well but the screenplay was pitiful. If more time was spent on the movie, it may have done better. Actually developing a relationship instead between dragon & rider instead of the instant noodle effect it had and a bit more common sense for the characters. Maybe it is just the book that sucks and the movie had to suck along with it, I personally don't want to know because I'm not reading the book.Eragon YOU FAIL!!! MISERABLY!!!P.s. Did anyone else realize that the head armor that was made for Saphira wasn't even used on her, so why show it for an extended amount of time.Hurts that a film of this genre was this bad. They should of split the two books into four movies, Eragon Vol 1 & Vol 2 and Eldest Vol 1 & 2.",Eragon

Durza was killed in a very stupid way first of all and he was one of my favorite characters in the book. Another thing is why does he seem much more evil than Galbatorix in the movie? And yeah they skipped out so many parts from the book. When I was reading the book I knew that it was made for a movie, every single event that happens (especially the ones with the Razac and Durza. They shouldn't have ruined it! Now everyone who didn't read the book will be discouraged from reading it. Why does Arya have blonde hair and why doesn't she have pointed ears?",Eragon
1303,jnollet,Great movie if you've read the book,8,29 May 2007,"I really enjoyed this movie. I had read the first book in the trilogy and this enticed me to reading the second book. I am anxiously awaiting the 3rd book and hope the movies continue in kind. The casting was pretty good with Eragon really looking as I expected. Jeremy Irons captured the Brom character very well also. The dragon, Saphira, looked great too. Kudos to the graphics team. Chris Paolini did well with the story. As I said before, I'd really like to see the next movie based on ""The Eldest"". More of the Arya character, and the inclusion of the dwarfs and elves would be a real plus. The lack of seeing Galbatorix follows the book line but for the story line in the movies it is hard to follow if you haven't read the books.",Eragon
1304,kaycee_j,This movie sucks,2,4 June 2007,"If you are looking for a good movie that portrays a GREAT book on film.....don't waste your time watching this! I understand that movies cannot provide all the detail, but it was only an hour and a half. I would have gladly sat through 3 hours to watch a movie that followed the plot line at least a little. There was not nearly enough detail to make me connect with the characters or understand their actions, etc. The only reason I gave this as high a score as 2 is because it looked like it wasn't a low-budget film, which really is not a complement considering that the costuming and characters did not accurately portray what I imagined from the book. I keep going to movies that are based on the concept of a book hoping one will actually capture the book on film, but I guess maybe I'm just wasting my time. I will not be seeing the 2nd movie in this sequence and I urge others to make the same choice.",Eragon
1305,preying_mantis_man,What a disappointment.,2,11 June 2007,"I was looking forward to seeing this movie for a very long time, and I must say, I was devastated by it. Good things: Brom, Durza, Saphira, the start of the movie. Bad things: EVERYthing else. At first I thought that the movie would be very good, because they did an excellent job of the start (they didn't rush it, and established the characters well). Unfortunately, everything after the moment when Brom sets Eragon's house aflame starts becoming steadily more and more substandard. Durza summons the Ra'zac (who look like they belong in the Egyptian tomb for people who were in house fires when they died, and they kill Garrow. Brom and Eragon set out on an adventure for no apparent reason (I thought they wanted revenge on the Ra'zac for Garrow's death,) and start heading south. When they reach Darrett, not everyone was massacred the the Urgals! Yay =D. Instead, they meet Angela the Herbalist (who apparently has another shop in Darrett, as well as in Teirm). Angela's appearance in this film is not only confusing, but also pointless. The only important part of that scene in the book was what Solembum the Warecat says, and they decided to cut that part out, and then we never see her again. After killing two random urgals, Brom and Eragon are attacked by the Ra'zac, who Brom kills! Wow. that was totally unexpected, considering the Ra'zac are supposed to kill Brom! Not only that, but that completely killed the plot in Eldest when the Ra'zac lay siege to Carvahal. Who knows, maybe Galbatorix will resurrect them from the dead in the next movie (if there is one). Brom is instead later killed by Durza (with about twenty minutes left in the movie.) The net twenty minutes are spent with Murtagh and Arya, who get to the Beors in about ten seconds of film, followed by them being captured by the Varden, and then immediately jumping into the sad five minute long ""battle"" scene. The end is accompanied by some good acting and irrelevant scenes, like the one where Murtagh tricks Eragon into thinking Saphira is dead, nice joke Murtagh! ""Hey, your soul mate didn't make it. LOL - JK!"". my guess is that the budgeters for the film spent millions on getting great actors, and millions on CGI effects, and about five thousand on the rest of the film! Very disappointing",Eragon
1306,adam-scorpion03,Underrated,8,14 June 2007,"This film has been massively underrated by an audience who was looking for a long dreary epic like Lord of the Rings, and even then managed to try and claim the film was too similar. I love this film, i think the acting from Speleers to Weisz is brilliant and they definitely picked the right person to become Eragon and the voice over for Saphira is great.The film was the right length at just under two hours, especially seeing as i don't like ridiculously long films and there was always something going on. Other than that, i know it does not really follow the book and i have read the book and am glad it didn't as it would have just made for a long film with large boring sections with no real bearing to the main storyline.Just a final bit stating that i watch a lot of dragon films and i can say this is one of my favourite. I would also like to say that i really do love the dragon, special effects are amazing on herScorpion",Eragon
1307,williamrinne666,Favourite movie,10,23 June 2007,"Well, i watched the movie like 10-20 times :) and it was still good at the last times, so i would say it's a masterpiece. It's very colorful and exciting how a simple farm boy gets this amazing opportunity. Oh and some of the goofs are wrong also. I recommend this movie to everyone. I Myself wondered how the rating of this movie can be so low ? i would give it a straight 10. I haven't yet red the book, but i surely will. In fact this movie has inspired me to be a collector of movie related items. The movie itself holds a quite good part of humor how Brom sort of mocks Eragon a few times. A good movie is not a waste of time, its a gain of centuries :)",Eragon
1308,riszpiisz,Leaves much to be desired...,1,24 June 2007,"This movie was horrible! The book is rich with imagery and detail that are just not represented in this movie. So much of the important details were left out of this movie such the training that Eragon receives from Brom, the fortune teller's cat, the honoring of Eragon by the Varden, and so much more. Anyone who read the book would be seriously disappointed by the way the story is presented in the film. I was really looking forward to seeing this movie hoping that the it could follow in the footsteps of Lord of the Rings, but I was let down big time. I'm not sure how much input Christopher Paolini had in the development of this movie, but I am surprised he allowed so much of the important details be left out. And I thought Arya's hair was supposed to be black!!",Eragon
1309,larrybradallison,thought I saw a Walhberg,6,24 June 2007,"Just curious. Did anyone else see a flash of a Walhberg brother in the scene where Brom is talking by the fire? I'm convinced of it, but can't find anything in the credits. I'm not a huge Wahlberg fan, looking for them everywhere, I'm just curious if any one else saw this. I couldn't find any mention of this character in the credits, or anything. My husband says I'm crazy, but I'm not entirely convinced of my insanity. . .yet. Please respond if anyone else noticed this. I also thought that the writer had written himself a role, but I didn't see him--did I miss him? Big fan of the movie, but a HUGE fan of the books. Thought some of the CGI was bad, but the movie was very close to the book. Guess it's hard to film a dragon, when we don't know where they are anymore! Thought the choice of Jeremy Irons and John Malkavitch were glorious, by the way. Irons' sarcasm suits the character of Brom, and Malcovitch, well, it works.",Eragon
1310,jharris927,Another great book bludgeoned to death,1,28 June 2007,"I absolutely adored this book... and I was so excited for the movie. It was terrible. They butchered it. There are so many things left out of the movie that are necessary in order for you to really understand the relationships between certain characters. The changes to how Saphira was raised, how Brom and Eragon meet, etc. are absolutely terrible. I understand that certain things need to be changed for cinematic sake, but this was just terribly done. The book was amazing. This movie was a travesty. Chalk it up to another great piece of literature that Hollywood needed to defecate all over to turn a profit. I'm not one to nit pick when books are made into movies, but this really angered me.",Eragon
1311,guyjulianlamballe,"No, Just.... NO",1,3 July 2007,"The Eragon series is one of the best if not the best fansty book series I have ever read. I am throughly looking forward to the third and final book. However, what Hollywood did in the movie was barely reconizable to the book. The movie got the character names right but thats about it. Saphira played her role pretty well in the movie. Out of all the characters, i felt that she was the closest thing to the book the movie got. I can't even explain how horrible the rest of the characters were. Here is a big mess up. The story line of the movie is different from the book. Throughout the movie, The Big Bad King is hunting down and trying to kill Eragon. In the book, the only reason why Eragon isn't dead is because the King wants Eragon alive. I vote to boycott Eldest.",Eragon
1312,joaodsousabio,Disappointment,3,6 July 2007,"Well, this is an awful movie. Really it is really bad, I Love the books, they are amazing with their story with their descriptions, but the movie, has nothing to do with the books...It's kind like they manage to condense the story so much that all the beauty was lost...In a stance, the movie skips main parts of the story... The movie changes many things about the story, one of the biggest mistakes is that brom kills a ra'zac, that is incredibly stupid, because they play a major rule in the books...DO not see the movie, Read the books... Great books, awful movie... Jeremy Irons acting was nice though, and arya is pretty cute...",Eragon
1313,andybaxter,It's good for kids,8,13 July 2007,"I think a lot of the comments on here are a bit out of order.I read the bad reviews and was put off viewing this at the cinema but I could not resist this film when it came on TV as PPV.I wish I had seen it at the cinema! In this day and age where makers of kids films seem obligated to make films three hours long (far too long for most adults, let alone their target audience), it was great to see a film which dares to cut out all the unnecessary padding and gets straight into the action.Yes, the story IS clichéd, yes the goodies and the baddies are cut out from templates but try to watch this film through the eyes of a child.It is perfect.Lasting just one and a half hours long, it tells the tale of a simple farm boy turned hero.The whole thing moves along at a hectic pace and there is barely one sequence in the whole film that has you thinking ""they could have left that out"" (how many children's films do you see these days when you don't find yourself saying that over and over again?) Anyone who complains about this film is trying to compare it with something that its target audience would find extremely boring.This film is very entertaining, it is easy to follow, the ""fight"" scenes are done with virtually NO blood and gore, at times it is very exciting and it maintains interest from the first minute to the last if you are willing to let the film be the film and not try to pick fault at every corner.I've seen far worse than this film. Don't let the critics put you off!",Eragon
1314,sandbergs7,Worst Fantasy Film Ever,1,17 July 2007,"Eragon is the worst fantasy movie I have ever set my eyes on, the actors were terrible, the script was horrific, and it's bad even if you haven't read the books. If you have read the book and compare them to the movie, they left out almost 2/3 of the main characters that are vital if they plan on making Eldest a movie (witch they left wide open for). They left out orrik, solembum, Katrina, the twins, the dwarfs altogether, and they messed up on the urgals, THEY ARE NOT REGULAR MEN, THEY ARE ORK LOOKING CREATURES WITH HORNS. HOW COULD FOX MISS THAT DETAIL UNLESS THEY WHERE TOTALLY RETARDED! I would have given this movie a -10 if it was possible. If I was Christopher paolini I would sue Fox.",Eragon
1315,dogster-4,Waste of time,1,21 July 2007,"Well I finally got to it and watched the film Eragon after reading the books Eragon and Eragon Eldest. What I find the most awful thing about the movie was how it was nothing like the book. Arja was not in the book until later on Roran did not leave just because he was going to be drafted to the army and so on. The script was just nothing like the book.I would like to see Peter Jackson take these books in a few years and make movies about the books because he did a pretty awesome job with Lord of the rings, and I think he will at least follow the books story line, that was not done in this movie and leaves the audience with pretty much with nothing.I liked the book so much and give it 10 out of 10 possible. So all of you that have seen the movie and don't want to read the book because of it are mistaken. The book is far more better then the movie.",Eragon
1316,Trapper14,Steven Fangmier..... put up your directing hat for good!,2,25 December 2006,"Horrible horrible horrible, 3 words that I will sum up the movie with! So many huge plot changes that I have no idea how they can mash up another 2 movies out of it!! One of my main annoyances is that fact that Galbatorix tries to kill him!! Not capture, and that is a HUGE HUGE plot line! See this movie only for the fact that Saphira was pretty, minus the stupid feathers! Everything is so rushed! The beginning of the movie was fairly well done, up to the part with Garrow getting killed, then everything falls apart. The trip to Jeods place was entirely left out, as is Eragon's training. No Orik! Horrible looking Urgals and Dwarfs! The twins are missing too!! a very important plot line for this book and the second! 1 hour and 36 minutes? Pathetic. I would sit through 3 hours if the movie paid any tribute to the book what so ever...I could rant on and on, but basically if you have read and enjoy the book you will want to kill yourself after seeing this movie. Destroys everything good about the book, and god help us if they make a second one... just my 2 cents :)",Eragon
1317,steelerfan15228,"If you have read the book, the movie will disappoint you",1,3 November 2007,"Horrible, horrible representation of the bestseller. for the book, great plot, imaginative characters, and the action is intense. the movie...3 words sum it up. not so much. the characters were all simple, generic people, and most were hardly mentioned at all. the plot was miserable in the movie, all it did was focus on one thing. half the towns visited in the book weren't even mentioned in the movie, let alone visited, and the intense action sequence that is supposed to take place at the end...what happened? there were about 20 troops shown for about 10 seconds, then Eragon and the shades epic aerial battle that never happened in the book, then a few seconds of Saphira toasting the 20 imperial(who never appeared in the book) troops. Personally, i hope they get a new director, preferably peter Jackson, and do the next one right. or, i hope the director, if they keep him, reads all these reviews and ratings and feedback people give him and realizes he can't make his own version of the book, he has to stick to it because people actually READ it and expect it to follow the same lines as the book. he butchered it.",Eragon
1318,mike-mcintire,Terrible,1,11 August 2007,"Skip it. I can usually separate a movie from a book, say like Harry Potter, Clear and Present Danger, etc. But this one was TERRIBLE! It was so short, and clearly planning for another movie, that they surely could have stuck to the book's storyline a lot closer. It even appears that the entire budget was spent on Saphira to the extent of the Urgals were just grunting humans without horns. Where were the twins? The Ra'zac were killed. The list goes on and on.They got MAJOR points wrong, that make a HUGE difference. Artistic license is one thing, complete plot changes is another.Just read the book, its good and quick. Forget the movie. It's not even worth watching before you've read the book as you'll have some plot spoiled by what is left of the story line.",Eragon
1319,pomsrus92,I actually liked it,8,18 August 2007,"I really Liked Eragon. So many people said it wasn't very good, but I disagree. I read the books and really liked them. I wanted to watch the movie but grew weary because everyone said the movie did not do the books any justice. I don't agree with those people, the movie was Awesome. I mean like any(and every) book turned movie there were quite a few differences but I stilled loved the movie. It was FULL of action! It was also really funny. The actors did great, and they did a great job on the dragons as well. Saphara, the dragon, in my opinion was the funniest character. I also liked Arya, but when I called my younger siblings to ask if they had watched it they said that they favorite character was Eragon, hands down. This is my opinion, so go watch it and make your own opinion!",Eragon
1320,tabaloogaimports,Not bad at all,9,30 November 2007,"Unlike the other commenter, I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. Granted I had not read the book but the movie was enjoyable to watch, lively with no long boring conversations. The landscape was breathtaking and the props and costumes were astounding. I do agree that the dragon was the most entertaining creature in this film but I found the other actors lively and believable as well. Lord of the Rings, however, I found too dark and gruesome. The death scenes in this movie were done in a way that even younger people and kids can enjoy this movie without getting nightmares. I can recommend this movie to anyone interested in fantasy films. Well done!",Eragon
1321,Kohjent,I agree with most,5,8 September 2007,"It is a pretty mediocre movie, relatively enjoyable and not hard work to watch but utterly let down by a very cheesy script, poor direction and - I'm sorry to say this but - most of all I couldn't STAND the voice of Saphira; I found it to be teenage-sounding and irritating, and was NOT appropriate for the thoughts of a fire-breathing armoured beast. I've read reviews on here dissing all the performances in the film apart from the 'vocal talents of the Oscar-winning Rachel Weisz' - have these people never heard of John Malkovich or Jeremy Irons? Their ample performances were swallowed up by the overall hamminess of the rest which was a damn shame. Ed Speleers in the lead role wasn't bad I thought, not as bad as everyone has said anyway. But please! No sequels with Weisz as Saphira!",Eragon
1322,cristi-trohin,"Good movie, could not look away from the screen",10,11 September 2007,"I think this was the best movie I saw since ""The Illusionist"". I did not read the book so I don't know if this movie does justice to the book, so I won't comment on that. Very good movie in my opinion, full of action and breath taking scenes. I can't wait to see the follow up. I just read that the producers were not ""very"" happy with the income this movie has brought, but it had the misfortune to not be so much promoted worldwide like ""LOTR"" was. Maybe the follow up will be better promoted. I loved the special effects. I liked how Ed played, even though at first I thought he has some big shoes to fill (thinking about Frodo played by Elijah Wood) because after all, this is intended to be the next Lord Of The Rings. I must admit the plot is a little thin but I saw movies with far thinner plots getting Oscars. I absolutely loved the fact that Rachel Weisz voice trough the movie, she was the outstanding.",Eragon
1323,lokilawson,So much potential....,4,23 September 2007,"There was too much story for the time allotted for the movie. A sequel will be hard to do because the characters were not developed enough. So much was lost... Such as the romantic tension between Eragon and Arya. By the way, Sienna Guillory did a fine job with the acting for Arya, but I think Kristin Fairlie would have made a better choice as far as the look goes. Check out her picture on this site and see if you don't agree. I tried to link it, but the rules won't let me. Again, you can find her on this site by searching her name.Apparently a lot of effort was put forth making Saphira look great (a success), but it seems that this was done to the neglect of the rest of the movie. Even the fight scenes were forgettable, which is sinful for a movie that devotes so much to digital effects. I don't want unrealistic fight scenes (Matrix and Episodes 1-3 of Star Wars), just a better indication of the scale and tension of the battles. Even the Monty Python movie Holy Grail knew how to do that.This movie should be re-done, even if it's low-budget, DVD release only. I guarantee that if the story is done correctly, and true to the book, it will make more money than this one. Paolini deserved more for his genius of a story and the fans deserve more, too.",Eragon
1324,shanew021,Eragon,9,25 September 2007,"I saw this movie opening night and was rather disappointed. Although, thinking back on it, it was a longer movie than most and would have been way to long if you added all the things in the book. I disagree with some of the comments that were posted before this saying that the movie couldn't possibly be made into a sequel because the information is lacking. I think that making a sequel, although it wouldn't be exactly like the book, would be good. The information that has been left out of the movie, although important to the book Eragon, doesn't effect the storyline of the overall story from both books. I think that the overall storyline of Eragon has been compromised very much, but because there are no movies, that I know of, that have followed the storyline exactly.",Eragon
1325,scottyman19892,I thought the movie was Great,8,18 October 2007,I don't think that the last comment was very true I read the books and even tho the movie and the book wasn't 100% exact it was still a great movie. I went to see it with my Girlfriend and brother and all three of of loved the movie it had great graphics and was just a Great movie for anyone who loves dragons and fantasy movie's. I know that if you read the book then saw the movie you may get a little disappointed but i think that you should give it a chance because no matter what it was still a great movie... I hope that they make the next movie because this one is kinda a cliff hanger and nobody likes a cliff hanger in a movie like this. If they make ELDEST I hope they follow the book a little more and if they do It'll be an awesome movie...,Eragon
1326,daz_max,Chris Paolini's work lies in ruins.,1,21 October 2007,"This movie could have been SO awesome, like another Lord of The Rings trilogy which would never die. Instead its a dry, cheap, shoddy knock-off of Christopher Paolini's work that should have never seen the light of day. Granted the cast has several big names such as Jeremy Irons (Brom) and Rachel Weisz (Saphira), but even if they had the greatest actors of ALL TIME, nothing could have fixed the bad writing and cheap work. The film is roughly 1 hour 40 mins long - if you think about it, done properly, thats barely enough time to probably get maybe...half of the way into the story? Because of that more than about 60% of the actual storyline was altered, for instance, Eragon and Brom don't even mention going to the port town or even Broms friend, which is a crucial part if you want to make the sequel! Yes, I know, you have to consider the budget as well...but it was financed by Fox! Im sorry but I thought the corporation was supremely rich?! Then you have all the little alterations that make a huge difference, like Saphira's appearance - since when did she have feathers?! You can NOT say its not possible to make a dragon with scales and membrane wings, they did it perfectly in Dragon Heart, do it again! The best course of action would be for another company - maybe Paramount - to remake it, they wouldn't even have to hire writers (Chris Paolini's already been nice enough to do that job for them!). Summary: If you have read the book, do NOT watch this film, as you will be very disappointed and have to join the angry, pitchfork-wielding mob already on the war path. Not read the book? Feel free to watch it as you wont have any kind of idea of how aggravating it is and will probably find it a good film.",Eragon
1327,computerguru6,Short or sweet?,6,17 December 2006,"Okay, so this wasn't the greatest movie of all time. But it wasn't that bad either. Speelers did a believable job as Eragon so hopefully we will see his acting career take flight, and casting Irons as Brom I think only helped. Although the movie is really too short to gain any information on the other characters, Malkovich and Guillory seemed to fit their roles although they were minimal, and Hedlund barely comes into play at all. Stefen Fangmeier could have stood to expand the story a little bit more. However, they did do a very good job with the animation of Saphira. All in all, it provided some decent entertainment while it lasted.",Eragon
1328,mjdon67,Star Wars ripoff,2,5 November 2007,"I give a lot of points for original work, this film was a complete rip off of Star Wars.Let's see we need.Young farm boy raised by uncle Remote farm far from center of town Uncle is killed by the bad guys looking for hero, and the farm goes up in fire your older cousin (or best friend Biggs) leaves you to join the resistance (happens in Star Wars book) special powers that come out of nowhere (jedi = magician) you know an old coot, who really is an amazing warrior and the very last of his kind same old dude is very wise, and good, and becomes your mentor but not for too long, cause if he is still around he'll fight all your battles, so let's make sure he gets killed off lightsaber (check) oh sorry it just kind of lights up red goes into fortress on impossible quest to rescue the girl (yep) dark lord with unbelievable ability is stopped by mentor and mentor is killed (got it) flying overhead strafing the enemy during the final battle scene (death star = hidden castle) really hard shot at end of movie places missile (sword) in tiny spot far away (heart = heat duct) please remember the dark lord is not the ultimate evil guy, the Emperor or should I say King is lurking in the background and let's not forget we need a Han Solo character so a replacement mentor/friend at the hero's age is found (the good archer dude)George Lucas should get a royalty for this.",Eragon
1329,rdht34,Is there a Eragon 2 coming,10,18 November 2007,"I thought that Eragon was the best movie about dragons and dragon riders for a long, long time. This movie was as great as the Lords of the Ring Trilogy. But, I haven't heard anything about a part two to this movie and the way they left it there needs to be one. I would like to see them make an Eragon 2, there needs to be a finish to the way the first movie ended! So, if anyone has heard if there will be a second movie I would like to hear about it. To those that said this movie was a poor example of movies like this, they have no idea what great is and have no right in comment about Eragon.

I thank my lucky stars that this was on demand and that I didn't have to pay for the movie because apart from some great flying on the dragon's part, the movie really wasn't that good. The acting (apart from whomever did the Dragon) really wasn't all that great. You could tell, with no back story to speak of, what was going to happen next. It might cut the cake for the kids, but that's about it. It was also way too short and needed more. Next time, I'm not going to watch a movie because of a song that was supposed to be in it, but wasn't even played until the credits started to roll.",Eragon
1331,williamff1993,odd ball crappy movie with a little CGI,6,15 May 2008,"This movie butchered Eragon from the book, all magic, dwarfs, everything. The ending with eragon and so called evil lord durza aerial fighting on dragon back and the black-thing wasn't necessary either. Though just for joy and pure fun, it wasn't climatic and i was deeply disappointed. Even the plot and journey of the book which told of eragon, brom and saphira hunting down the razac was totally changed. the sceneries weren't good to look at either and farthen dur wasn't what i imagined it to be. And the deep personality developments from the books aren't shown here. I was not encouraged by the movie that eragon was actually a hero, and thought that he was just some whiny kid with a sword and a dragon which he doesn't deserves. This movie completely ruined my imagination for the novel. for shame. and lastly, this movie will eliminate any chance of having sequels for the future.",Eragon
1332,goaltender_36,Perhaps Peter Buchman should have actually read Eragon.,4,1 December 2007,"Wow, I don't even know what to say in response to this movie. I will shamefully admit to reading and mildly enjoying both Eragon and Eldest, but I don't think that Peter Buchman (screenwriter) can claim to have accomplished that feat. I'm far from an expert, but if you were going to convert a book to a script, you might want to, I don't know, maybe read the book? If Buchman had, maybe this movie wouldn't have been the complete and total disaster that it was. I'm not saying that if the movie had followed the book it would have been great because Eragon the book, while mildly entertaining, is riddled with other peoples ideas. I don't know how Paolini (author) can hold his head high while blatantly plagiarizing such masterpieces as Lord of the Rings and Star Wars. Warning: mild spoilers follow: Where else in literature can you find elves that are tall, graceful, peerless blacksmiths, and speak in a flowing language? LOTR sound familiar? Eragon now comes to mind also, since paolini robbed Tolkien of this idea. As for the star wars, how about the idea of a poor farm boy who lives with his uncle? The uncle is killed, and the young farm boy is trained by an old mentor who is later killed. This idea somehow shows up in both Eragon and Star wars. But I digress, so back to the movie: next time you need a villain, don't turn to an actor who sounds like he is whining all the time? I didn't know it was possible to botch up an evil role, but John Malkovich proved me wrong. His is, by far, the worst ""villian"" performance of all time.Not to be outdone, Ed Speleers delivers his lines in a robotic, shallow performance. The casting director couldn't find anyone with a shred of talent, so they had to turn to Speleers, the talentless wonder? However, the blame doesn't lie solely with Speleers- to bring this review full circle, i will say that Buchman is the reason this movie failed. He killed off characters didn't die in the book because they play a large part in Eldest. He massacred the novel, changing Eragons age for no particular reason, and overall writing a horrible script. In conclusion, this movie is awful, Buchman sucks, and there is no reason to watch this mess of a movie, as it will only result in 104 minutes of pure, mind-numbing agony.",Eragon
1333,rachelperp,Awful - especially for fans of the book.,1,5 December 2007,"A terrible adaptation of an excellent book. Very disappointing to those who read the book and those who didn't alike. Lackluster (often due to total lack of talent) acting, laughable script, cut out important characters and events, and rushed/sloppy pacing. The effects were alright, but that by no means redeemed the film considering that any movie with a budget can produce decent CG. This being said, Saphira had an ungainly and unlikely anatomy which certainly wasn't true to the book's very detailed description. As has been said, Rachel Weiss did very well. Needless to say, if they even bother to continue with the sequels they'll have different directors/producers/screenwriters/everyone. Can someone get Peter Jackson over here to give this thing CPR? Ugh. You'll want your time and money back.",Eragon
1334,hypertyyp,It started with a great book...,1,20 March 2007,"and continued with a movie that, is lack of a better word, truly disappointing. Most actors cant even comprehend their characters, they probably haven't even read the book and storyline of the movie doesn't follow the book not even close. Only reason that this movie got 1 form me, is that 0 wasn't available. Most important key lines and events were totally ignored. Movie length of 1.45 hours is pathetic, its should have been at least 2 and half hours. When you have some many great movies to take inspiration from (LOTR would be a good example), why would anyone take such a good story and make suck a crappy movie about it! You know, for making money there are lots of others stories that you can use and please use those to produce junk, but please left the good story's alone or at least give em to directors who actually know how to direct a movie.Only positive side form this movie was, that evil characters were pretty good and both actors, John Malkovich and Robert Carlayle really know how to bring their characters true side out. That was really the only good thing about this movie, the rest of it was juts way incomplete and RAW! Please, whom ever it is who's making ""Elder"", make it a movie to watch and enjoy, You don't have to put everything from the book in it, but at least get the storyline right and put all the key elements in the right place and ""Elder"" could be the movie that would justify vision of Christofer Paolini's great work Please give the viewers something to enjoy, while the watch and if You cant do that, than don't make the sequel at all!",Eragon
1335,Simonal777,Great book made into an awful film what a shame,1,13 January 2007,"Like others I have seen this film after reading the book and what a shame. The book is great fun and well worth a read if you are into the fantasy novel/storyline type of novel ( i.e. if you like things like Harry Potter and Lord of the Rings). But the film is so poorly executed that it is not even worth a movie of the week! The actors tried their best but they were fighting a loosing battle. The direction is at best 3rd rate and I feel that the director should never be allowed to direct another novel as he had no idea. The script writers should be fed to a dragon! They botched the storyline it is now impossible for them to properly follow the next book if indeed they get the funding, which they should not. This should go to somebody who is capable of properly and someone who has at least read the book. You only have to look at other films of the same type,such as the Harry Potter series and Lord of the Rings, to see the failure that this film is....Most disappointing film of 2006.",Eragon

This is not credited anywhere, in reviews, comments or trivia. Most of the dragon-riding concepts are McCaffrey's - not Paolini's. And certainly not George Lucas'. Though one part of the ""dragon business"" that's just plain blown, high wide and handsome, is the total lack of downdraft when the dragon launches herself from the ground.

1338,pixie_rains,Amazing,10,31 December 2007,This movie was amazing! My little nieces absolutely loved it. The acting was excellent. the visual effects were great. I am really excited to see part 2 of this movie hopefully they complete filming it as soon as possible. For those that don't appreciate the movie more then likely it is because you read the book. You need to learn that not all detail can be put into the time frame of a movie a book will always be filled with more. So just watch the movie and appreciate the effort by everyone involved making the novel into a film for you. I certainly enjoyed it and I hope all that watch it in the future keep an open mind so they can enjoy it as well.,Eragon
1339,rogayn,Quite an entertaining movie. One I will watch again.,7,2 January 2008,"Having never read the book(s) I don't have that reference upon which to rely. However, as a movie, I think it works quite well. I've read criticism of the writing, acting and directing... all unwarranted in my opinion.The only negative things I would agree with are that it could have been longer and it did leave a few questions unanswered... which, I imagine would have been answered in the sequel. The only other criticism I would offer is that it was too obviously set up with a sequel in mind and, consequently, has a difficult time standing on its own.As far as the acting... it did vary from character to character. I can only think of a handful of movies (good and bad)for which that isn't true. I found the acting strong enough to carry the movie to the end. And the effects (which were excellent) only added to the enjoyment.Neil",Eragon
1340,kpeva,Falls short of all expectations,2,6 January 2008,"When people say the book is always better than the movie, it definitely applies to Eragon. At first, I was ecstatic to be able to see one of my all-time favorite books come to life on the big screen. However, I was greatly disappointed even before the plot, if there was any, took off and gained momentum. What to criticize first? For starters, the acting...could have been better. Relationships between the characters was either rushed or wasn't established at all and most of the characters felt like they were running around in the movie without a guiding point. I literally almost stopped watching for the sake of keeping my sanity. The movie itself didn't even have a climax, at least none that I felt, and one of the biggest conflicts in the book (cannot mention for the sake of spoiling the movie) is far from being highlighted and emphasized enough, very far. To make a long story short, if the book were a human being, the movie maybe took several bones from the skeleton and tried to create a full fledged, moving human. Save yourself some time and read the book. :]",Eragon
1341,philgross30,Makes you realize how good LoTR really was,5,15 December 2006,"Plotwise, the first half of this film and the first half of Star Wars, A New Hope are virtually identical. A Princess is on the run with a secret needed to destroy the evil Empire. Evil Emperor sends out his scary lieutenant with supernatural powers to recover it. He captures the princess, but the secret falls into the hands of Blond Farmboy (BF), who is being raised by his uncle. BF meets up with burned out Old Warrior, who feels the old fires relit, and knows how to bring the farmboy to the Rebels' secret base while teaching him how to fight and use his mystical powers. Along the way, disaster threatens when BF rashly decides to rescue the Princess from her heavily guarded prison. I'll stop there, but suffice it to say that there are plenty of further parallels.Also reminiscent of the works of George Lucas are the many stilted, clichéd, or ridiculous lines, bringing to mind the execrable dialog from Episodes 1-3. The audience at the midnight showing I attended burst into laughter at several of the most hackneyed lines (although never laughed as loudly as they did after the pathetic pre-movie preview for future-Razzie-recipient ""Blood and Chocolate"").Visually, this movie would have been impressive if the LoTR trilogy didn't exist. Despite the same guys from Weta doing special effects (along with ILM) most of the visuals were similar to LoTR, but weaker. The final battle looked a lot like a watered-down Helms Deep. The generic bad guys are like watered-down orcs (although there are also distinctive assassin beasts). Even the dragon didn't look a lot better than the Fell Beasts of the Nazgul.I left the theater with a deep appreciation for Peter Jackson's ability to capture the epic nature of LoTR on screen. I know this is only the first of a trilogy, but I never felt any great attachment to any of the characters, and was rarely impressed with the visuals. The cast and director present the material with conviction, but the material was just too derivative to appreciate.",Eragon
1342,chunho,Worse than the book,3,22 January 2008,"OK, the book has been a mediocre one, but this is pretty awful.The storyline has many elements from other fantasy novels. You could probably predict how the story is going to develop after you've read through the first few chapters. However, not even that is possible with the film. The story proceeds at a breakneck speed and it's very hard to catch up with it. Eragon learns magic in just a matter of minutes.There is little dialogue other than the main characters (e.g. Eragon, Brom, Saphira). I do believe that nobody has said more than ten sentences other than the aforementioned characters.The film has some inaccuracies too. Have you ever read that a dragon has feathers for wings? I vaguely remember that the book has said dragon's wings are thin membranes countless times.Don't watch this movie. If you insist on knowing this story, read the book. Better still, read the other fantasy novels out there such as Lord of the Rings or Earthsea.",Eragon
1343,Rockoder10,Um...It wasn't good (if you read the book),2,18 December 2006,"****MAJOR SPOILERS**** Having read the book I went into the theater excited and hoping it would be like the book, as faithful as the Harry Potter movies are to their series of books, at least. But, alas I was disappointed greatly. They missed a lot of important details, it was only an hour and a half, it should of at least lasted an hour longer. Also, it was extremely choppy and if you read the books you will be extremely disappointed, if not, you might actually like it. First of all, the sets where completely wrong...(SPOILERS START HERE) Farthen Dur wasn't even in the mountain, it was more like in a valley surrounded by a mountain not actually in one. The Rose Star wasn't even in it (I forgot the proper name, the thing at the top of Farthen Dur). They where actually MISSING whole cities Teirm, and Dras-Leona, Their wasn't a Jode (Which is understandable...I guess), Angela was way to pretty it was Joss Stone I kind of envisioned her to be like Professor Sprout (from the movie), she wasn't even in the right town. They put her in Daret I believe, which made no sense, the town should have been empty when they got their. Probably the thing that made me the angriest is the characters they left out, their was no Solumbum, whom should have been in their if they plan on making a sequel. Elva, also important for a sequel, and of course Orik, Katrina, and the twins. These missing characters the choppiness of the plot, among other things ruined the movie.Not to mention, the acting wasn't up to par, Ed was okay considering it was his first movie, and Saphria actually worked quite well. She grew up in like five minutes because of time restrains but some things they left out their wasn't an excuse. They way Eragon found out about Brom being a Rider ruined that sort of subplot. Rohan was leaving for work, not the ARMY. Murtaugh wasn't done correctly either, he was supposed to have more time with Eragon so they could learn to like each other and so Eragon would be more shocked when he found out about his (Murtaugh's) lineage.Overall, as a fan of the books, the movie sucked; and for a person who hasn't read the books and go to the movie to enjoy a movie, they will probably like it, but will have a lot of questions. So, in all, it really was terrible!",Eragon
1344,gymkat13,"Cliché filled, but not a bad film",5,27 January 2007,"First of all, I haven't read the book (which I hear is not the best of reads, but decent), so this comment is strictly on the film as a film, not an adaptation of a book. Most of the plot was somewhere between Star Wars and Lord of the Rings, but I really enjoyed the movie. The script is not the best either, but it's really hard these days with all that followed Lord of the Rings to have an fantasy story that looks original. The acting wasn't bad at all. I thought Ed Speeler did a great job for his first movie. He was ten times better than Hayden Christiansen, for example. Some highlights for me were the music, special effects and Jeremy Irons. I'm very happy that they didn't overdo the special effects, but kept it authentic looking. There weren't any gigantic computer animated armies like in Lord of the Rings, which just don't look believable. I also really thought it was a good movie, because it worked with a simple plot and didn't get too elaborate. I wouldn't say it deserves any awards, but it was an enjoyable movie and I hope they go ahead and make a sequel, despite the bad reviews.",Eragon
1345,lord_of_secrets,Really Bad Film,1,25 September 2008,I can start this by saying the missus walked out of the cinema during the film. It seems to keep the character names and loose everything else! Off all the actors in the film I really feel sorry for young Ed Speelers because this film has devastated his career before it even began (I mean at the writing of this comment his picture isn't next to his name!). There is no character development in the entire film and as a result the characters look shallow and unmotivated. According to a few people I know who haven't read the book it isn't even a very good film on its own. These guys missed a great opportunity to make an epic trilogy that could have stood out with the greats but they blew it. I feel sorry for anyone who should try to make this film in the future because they will be shot down before they start.,Eragon
1346,ZiadSaliba,Big Disappointment,5,27 August 2008,"Eragon, first and foremost, is a movie adaptation that was trying to follow in the glorious footsteps of franchises such as Lord of the Rings, Harry Potter and the Chronicles of Narnia. They say that a cast, if perfect, can drive the movie by itself, to our big disappointment, the cast did not live up to its name. Having great actors like Jeremy Irons, Djimon Honsou..etc..., every one of them was miscast especially the lead actor. It has an incredibly weak script that tries very hard to satisfy the story and the battle sequence is mediocre at best. All in all, I wont recommend this movie to anybody who enjoys brilliantly visualized fantasy epics with great story lines.",Eragon
1347,tiny-65,Only the names were right?,1,9 February 2008,"When my brother, sister, and I first heard this movie was coming out, we were thrilled! We all loved the book and couldn't wait to see the movie! But when we saw that Saphira (dragon) had feathers and not scales, and no spikes, AND no membrane wings, we knew something was wrong! During the entire movie we caught ourselves staring at each other in complete amazement! Eragon was supposed to be a hunter/farmer so you'd think they'd at least find a kid that was moderately muscled! No such luck. Then when Saphira flew up into the sky, came down, and was magically adult sized...we were beside ourselves with pain for the author, our hearts went out to him! Every important character was met in a different place! They left out one of the MOST important characters, Solembum, a werecat who gives Eragon important information. Also, they made it seem as if Arya was in love with Eragon but the book never states that. If I were you, I would definitely read the book first.",Eragon
1348,sauliux0,Huge letdown,2,19 July 2008,"I went to the cinema hoping this would be like another lord of the rings- an intense fantasy movie based on a great fantasy book. Sadly, I was greatly disappointed. This movie was one of the worst book to movie adaptations I've seen in a long time. It seems though the writers of the script didn't even read the book- they left out major plot lines and thought up too many things that weren't even in the book! Yes, I know that if they tried to make entire book into movie it would last for like 7 hours and they must shorten it, but for god's sake at least try not to leave out important things and don't think up your own dialogs and situations... Even the majority of the book characters ( I mean those who have actually made it into the movie) were casted incorrectly. Eragon and Durza were pretty much okay and I think Ajihad was cast right. The others... Well Jeremy Iron's does well in portraying Brom by his character, but not, I'm afraid by his appearance. Arya was a total letdown- she was supposed to have black hair and pointy ears and be a cold, tough and mysterious elf, but now it seems that they made her into some... I don't know, but she just isn't right. Speaking about races in the movie- Men, Elves, Dwarfs, Urgals- well in the movie there are none. Galbatorix (who wasn't even supposed to be in the movie yet, cause Paolini hasn't even described yet how he looks!) mentions dwarfs and elves once, but dwarfs are never seen in the movie, except for Hrothgar, who never has his name mentioned and talks only once in the entire movie (and plus, he looks nothing like a dwarf) and the elves... they all just look human. And Urgals were the biggest letdown- they were supposed to be huge man-like beasts, something like lord of the ring's uruk-hai, just with horns, but now... they are just fat, bearded humans, colored themselves like some barbarians. Pathetic.Also sometimes I think why did they even need swords in this movie? Zar'roc is used in combat only twice, once by Brom and second by Eragon against some soldier. The only fight that looked nice was the stick fight between brom and eragon... Oh my god, where is Eragon's duel with Arya, where is duel with Murtagh, where is the fight between Eragon and the Shade? I guess these seemed too unimportant to be made into a movie, let's have a dragon versus some shadow beast fight instead, which wasn't even in the book! I could go and go with this movie's disadvantages, but... let's talk about advantages. Surprised? Yes, indeed some of the movie parts are kinda good. Saphira- is done perfectly, both her CGI appearance and voice-over. And the score- Patric Doyle's music is epic, I got the entire soundtrack and rarely will you find such intense pieces of music fit for combat as Battle for Varden theme. Advantages... that's about it actually.Summary? Well I've been going on an on about what movie did incorrectly according to the book. IF this movie wasn't based on Eragon the book, it would actually make quite a simple, though decent action movie fantasy style. Call it Dragon Rider or something, change the character's names and there you go. But naming it after such a great book? It's an absurd. The only way to get out of this? Remake. Definitely. Now this series is stuck because Eldest cannot be made following Eragon because most characters important in book two are not even in the movie and important plot lines are left out. So the remake is the only way. I would really love to see entire Inheritance Cycle as movies, but decent movies! Not something like this again.",Eragon
1349,Illisil,Waiter I'd like Star Wars with a side of LoTR,3,28 March 2008,"I read the book before I saw the movie and I thought the book was a lot of fun. But watching the movie was just like watching other movies being remade with different costumes and locations. They cut too many corners and were trying to cash in on the hype created by the LoTR movies.Eragon, obviously being the equivalent of Luke Skywalker, being a farm boy, who's uncle dies and rides away with the mysterious old man.They ride out and eventually have to rescue the trapped princess Arya/Leia, who serves as the love interest of the main character, with the help of a shady character Murtagh/Han Solo (it is not mentioned in the Star Wars movies but Han Solo is, in earth language, a drug runner). This occurs in the enemy stronghold spooky tower/Death star.The mysterious old man Brom/Obi Wan, who is a closeted Dragon Rider/Jedi just like the main character, dies, killed by the main antagonist Durza/Vader. They then make their way to the hidden rebel (varden/Rebel) base, which is in an environment with lots of lush greenery, and prepare to fight the climactic battle of the movie.The enemy employ the use of characters which are apparently identical, storm troopers/urgals.And in the end, the battle is fought and the main antagonist of the movie Durza/Deathstar is destroyed but the ultimate antagonist John Malkovich/Darth Vader, escapes, making room for a sequel.Also, Durza and John Malkovich just like Darth Vader, are trying to get the one thing in the whole world/galaxy that the rebels can use to defeat them.LoTR connections.The scene with Eragon fighting Durza before Brom is killed, reminds me of the scene with the Balrog, with the Balrogs streaming red mane of fire not unlike Durza's red hair, and Eragon's fire arrows blue, like Gandolf's magic. Also, the red/blue thing is used in star wars with Obi Wan with a blue saber, and Vader with a Red one.Also, the scene with Durza talking to the urgals, looks EXACTLY like the scene in LoTR with Sarumon talking to the Uruk Hai, even the way his hair blows back is almost IDENTICAL!!This movie rates a 3 because I thought the dragon having feathers was VERY unique and was about the only thing in the movie I haven't seen before.I think this could have been really great, I was excited to see the urgals (who in the book are 7 foot tall ram-like creatures with fangs), but found myself sorely disappointed with the whole thing.

Oh and the biggest mess up was Saphira! she had feathers? what? seriously? man they just screwed up this move. i know that the movies are never Really by the book but this was horrific. they did such a bad job. the urgals are very wrong, ajihad and his people were messed up from what i pictured. were brom was buried was way off and it all just stunk. i wouldn't recommend this move if you have read the book.",Eragon

Peter Buchanan was given a book that was a phenomenal bestseller and turned it into one of the most shameful movies ever written. The movie had almost nothing to do with the book except for the bare plot. More detail could have been added, the Lord of the Rings books were shorter in length and the movie was twice as long. The casting was bad. The characters were unimaginative and didn't put much effort into their work. I have to applaud Rachel Weisz for the spectacular work as Saphira. Jeremy Irons tried to work with what he was given but the lines were just too bad. Ed Speelers looked like he didn't know what was happening. However, the special effects were nothing short of spectacular. That is the only reason I gave this movie two stars and not zero.I still think that the book was unbelievable and could have been turned into a fantastic movie. I think it's time for Peter Jackson and his crew to become heroes and do this movie with New Line Cinemas.

Awaiting the third novel is a true test of patience. I also highly recommend the audio books ~ THERE is where the stories and characters come to LIFE! Listening to these exceptional CDs over again helps bring out the genius of the writing. How a 15 year year old could have observed and experienced so much of life to put the details into text is amazing! A true gift.

It is unfortunately a children's version of a series of great books. The story line was way too changed and it would have been better of if you kept the original issued from the book. I reckon this could still have potential but you might need to consider doing a longer film shortening the original storyline. I might take for example the Lord of the Rings series of film which do really represent the books that they issued from. I do not really know if this is a money issue as I know that your try on Eragon wasn't really successful in the cinemas but I would still give it a try.If it was me, I would redo the Eragon part of the series into a more adult and longer way to convince the fans of the 2 soon 3 books that the movie versions are the books in visual format. The movie that you realised in 2006 was, in that aspect, not convincing at all.Although I am very sure that you wont redo this movie, I think that a lot of people, like me, are hoping on IMDb to ""redirect the shot"" by submitting a petition to 20th century fox.",Eragon

The story was well thought out and written beautifully, and the detail and ideas actually original for the first time in a long time.And yet the production of this movie is such an incredible screw up, i actually went out of my way to make an account to write this. I HATE this movie. I feel that the original story had most - if not all - of the secrets revealed that were not actually done so until much further through the second book, half of the events that actually took place in the fist book are not shown or are edited, making the production of the third book now almost impossible (and if such a thing was done, i don't think i'd go to watch it simply because of the impression this one left with me). This movie completely killed the book. I daresay Christopher P. must have nightmares thinking about this movie. They took his beautiful artwork, stabbed in and smeared feces all over it.All in all, i think any viewer of this movie aged 3+, with enough wit to have read the book before/after having seen the movie, will find more enjoyment reading '1001 ways to properly format hate mail'.By the way, there were about 50 swear words in this comment 'prohibited' by IMDb.

But he is not the only one who deserves special mention in this epic bad movie. It gets worse with the characters of Galbatorix and Arya being very poorly portrayed, while Garrett Hedlund being fascinatingly disastrous struggling to make his own Murtagh. Robert Carlyle gave a decent performance as the Shade, trying to be frightening and psychic, but the very choice of Robert Carlyle as the menacing Shade was a mistake. Trying to uphold Eragon as a great fighter with unmatched dueling skills and abilities, and Arya- the helpless Elf female who so depended on him, well the director and the producers have not read Paolini's novel.The only decent performance in the movie was of Jeremy Irons playing Brom, while Rachel Weisz was phenomenal giving voice to the Dragon.Coming to the story and screenplay, they get steadily worse with each scene through the 1.44 hr. movie, with the director coming up with his own versions and fighting sequences to attract the audience with mindless action and special effects.

There is a lot information that is indispensable for the understanding of the second film and that is missing from the first one. It could have better actors although Jeremy Irons,John Malcovich and Rachel Weiss were good choices for the respective roles. The character of Arya was very different from what was described in the book. The story say's she's an black haired elf but on the film she appears as a red haired human. Saphira , however was successfully created. Although in the film she magically grow's up in second's. According to the book Carvahall isn't as poor as described in the film, it has big rich houses and the people who live there aren't dirty and their clothes weren't as mended as shown on screen.

That's when I got the book as a present for my 16th birthday and I instantly fell in love with it, so it didn't take much to finish it off.They built a whole village up in the crater of the hill and spent MONTHS there, while I was waiting for the film to be launched in the cinemas. Some time near Christmas we decided to a go and watch it. What I saw in that 1,5 hour was nothing else than a completely distracted, screwed, twisted, let's-hurry-up-because-time-is-money-ish plot without even the slightest resemble to the mood and style of the original book. The similar scenes from LOTR and Star Wars, the awful acting of Ed ""cute blonde bloke with dragon"" Speleers, the literal NOTHINGNESS that John Malkovich produced, the clichés, the absence of important roles and events really contributed to the obvious fact, that this movie was a BIG FAIL. Besides, I also felt some other disappointment, because the Ság Hill and everything within it only took 5 minutes of the film. 5 minutes, that's what we got from months of preparation, night shootings, and ""re-arranging"" the crater of a 5-million-year old national reserve park. Was it worth it?",Eragon
1364,redwolfops,What the hell o.O,1,15 August 2008,"Like seriously, I like the book I red it a few times. Not to sound like a geek or anything (lawl) but there were like parts in the movie where it never happened, settings were not what they were and there is like parts of the movie where it's just a big waste of time. Here's and example, durzac (how ever you spell it, I forgot o.O) they mix like 3 different cities in one small place, this movie is like stupid. The only part of the movie I like was the person who voiced Saphria. With all that wasted parts, I bet you could actually put in some scenes that actually happened :o and btw people who weren't supposed to die, died anyway, lameps btw urgals have horns and are like 10ft and up, not some 6 foot, bulky WWF wrestler >_>",Eragon
1365,eddy_jack0,Nothing Like The Book,2,10 September 2008,"It should have been a 15 if they stuck to the book, Brom actually swears, there's tonnes of bloody carnage at the end were thousands of humans and dwarfs struggle against the Urgals, the film on the other hand does not and I thank my lucky stars I didn't go to see this in the cinema. Calling Warner Bros. and Legendary Studio's - Remake leave the action as it was in the book. Plus the beginning of this film is so corny! the music for the film could have been so much better, in addition the 'Elf' has very round ears... many of the fight scenes are extremely dark, badly lit, the shade fight at the end was really decent effects but not like the book, however it was the only good bit really.",Eragon
1366,aBlGTree,book great. movie sucks,1,13 September 2008,"I really enjoyed the book ""Eragon"" and it's sequel, ""Eldest"", but I must say, the movie that I originally had extremely high hopes for, sucked. Its storyline was the same... boy finds dragon egg, raises dragon and becomes Rider to defeat evil king, but OMG I honestly didn't think it could stray so far from the book! The acting was less than commendable (besides Jeremy Irons, who did very well, and Rachel Weisz, who gave life to Sapphira), the sequence of action was WAY out of wack, and the boy that played Eragon, Speleers, didn't even fit the description of Eragon as was given in the book! In my opinion, the movie needs to be remade, and I think the team that brought ""The Lord of the Rings"" trilogy into cinema should be the ones to do it, along with the remaining books of the Inheritance series. But keep Jeremy Irons and Rachel Weisz in the cast!",Eragon
1367,cerian-halford,Really liked it!,9,30 March 2010,"I really liked this movie and was really surprised by the reviews people have left about this film. I found that i really enjoyed it. I've read the book and even though the film differed to the book i prefer it when they do that because then you can appreciate them both separately and not compare them too much. I thought the acting was quite good, probably not the best element of the film, but still good. I thought that Ed Speleers' acting is good, especially for his first film role, and Rachel Weisz was,as you'd expect, very good as the voice of Saphira. The special effects were good. There were many moments in the film which had me holding back the tears as well, though i can be a bit weepy with movies. I did think it was a real shame that Murtagh didn't have a bigger role though. Overall i recommend this movie to everyone.",Eragon
1368,mfrancesco2313,Disappointment,1,29 September 2008,"Unfortunately I have read the books a few times each and I could not believe how awful this movie was. The character were all wrong I mean elves have pointed ears stated clearly in the book, they don't have those in the movie. Arya had Jet black hair which you can see she does not. There are many other little things like that that I can go on about since i liked the books so much much the major things that were just horrible were, Urguls where beast with horns not men i mean they fought with humans as two races who hated each other. Fathurn Dur was a dwarf city deep within a volcano not out side on some fields. The razac battle was just stupid. the screen writer should be fired and the producer for letting such an mutilation of a great book that could of been an epic like movie of LOTR proportions. The deviated from the book quiet a lot which also irked me. The acting was pretty bad and the biggest think is the whole movie looked Corny like they spent 90% of the budget on the CG dragon and 10% on the rest of the film which could explain why the urglus were displayed as humans instead of resembling the orcs in LOTR and why they couldn't even afford black hair dye and a pair of pointy ears for Arya. If another movie is ever made I hope that new directors and screen writers are found and that they stick to the book more and maybe spare some of the budget on the film because if those were possible and it can even resemble 60% of a LOTR film it would be a great movie.",Eragon
1369,ewcarlson1,would not watch again FOR FREE,1,29 September 2008,"The comments on this movie that give it 10 stars are ENRAGING. I don't understand how someone could see this movie and think it was OK if they were older than 7. Every acting performance except for Saphira's was terrible, and something like that is not enough to redeem such a disaster of a movie even a little bit. I realize that movie adaptations are rarely the same as the book, and I understand why, but every alteration made did nothing but make the film more cheesy. BY THE WAY, Galbatorix is supposed to be illusive, which is why he is not even in the first book at all. As stated by someone else, Saphira does not have feathers. An hour and 45 minutes? Please. This book is longer than the individual LOTR books. This was a movie made to make money off of children, when anyone who read the book knows by the length and content that it is certainly NOT a children's book. When I left the theater, I thought to myself, ""I am not even a little bit curious to see the next installment."" Not surprisingly, it doesn't look like they're considering making it. Thank GOD.",Eragon
1370,zmagnuson_876,Nothing like the book,1,8 October 2008,"I'm going to start by saying the movie is terrible. It is nothing like the book. What were you thinking only making it a hour long come on that and the villains they look extremely fake. Besides aren't the urgals suppose to have horns? They look like ogres not urgals. If they make a Eldest (sequel to Eragon) it will be terrible. They left way to many facts out besides Eragon didn't meet Murtagh in Teerm. He met him when he shows up while Eragon and Brom are fighting the Razac. Terrible, Terrible, Terrible thats all i have to say about this horrible movie. Don't even bother trying to make an Eldest movie if your going to ruin the entire story line like this again. I recommend not even watching the movie it makes me sick on how bad it is every time I see it.",Eragon
1371,airusa-1,This movie should be burned,1,25 October 2008,"Before I read the book I thought that the movie wasn't to bad. Now fast forward about 3 months when i finally decide to read Eragon. Upon conclusion of the book you discover every single flaw in the story that makes up this movie. I could go on about the giant pieces of main plot points that are nowhere to be seen in the movie, but I will only mention one thing that really displayed the lack of effort that went into this movie. ARYA DOESN'T EVEN HAVE POINTED EARS IN THE MOVIE!!! I have seen many other comments about the one bright spot of this movie and the is the CGI Saphira and the voice work of Rachel Weisz. I also thought that Jeremy Irons did an OUTSTANDING job with the wretched filth he was given to work with.As a closing I plea to all filmmakers Not to touch this story unless you are willing to put forth the effort that it deserves. There are many other stories you can smear into utter crap, just leave this one alone.",Eragon
1372,marco_polo_rox_your_sox,Eragon - Beautiful Phail,4,26 October 2008,"The trouble with this film is that the characters are portrayed terribly. For example, Ed Speelers (Eragon), is so terrible at showing emotions in the film that a duck would likely have played the part more effectively. Jeremy Irons is the only convincing character here with some actual acting skill.The Special Effects are stunning, however, and it's a crying shame that the actors don't seem so pretty.Another issue is that so many facts are left out from Eragon that a sequel (Eldest). For example, the Cripple Who Is Whole is not mentioned and therefore Eragon has no knowledge that he is to journey to Ellesmera for tutoring. Allegedly Eldest is sue out in 2009. I will only go to see it if it gets a good average of 7/10. After the poor acting and scripting of Eragon, I don't hold any hopes for Eldest. I still read the books though as they actually are epic whereas this is abysmal.4/10 'Nuff said",Eragon
1373,tnkbrewer,eragon was great,10,28 October 2008,"I loved this movie! I don't read books so I don't know what it's compared to. I know that the negative comments are b/c people read the book first and saw it wasn't the same. But for you that hasn't read it, who cares b/c it was good and I wish there was a sequel. For the ones that read it why not just keep an open mind and think of it as it's just another story but made very good. I think it is just as good as Narnia, Lord of the Rings, Water Horse, Spiderwick, Harry Potter. If you like fantasy movies then you should like this. I just hate to see people bash the movie just because they are comparing it to the book. The movie also left it where it wasn't the end of the story so I still have hope!",Eragon
1374,magginolia,Disney Fairytale Disgrace,1,17 November 2008,"I expected a wonderful movie depicting the beauteous realism and original fantastical plot of the book. Like several other fans of the story, I was let down.The book painted a mental imagery of hidden lands, beseeching innocents, and vicious evil. The movie completely sugar-coated it and turned it into some low-class Disney fairytale.Now, I'm not a fairytale-hater (in fact, I lived for Disney movies...), but, personally, I don't feel Eragon was meant to be some juvenile children's fairy tale. It was meant to be a Lord-of-the-Rings-esquire fantasy, with just a hint of darkness to enthrall viewers and readers alike.Although the CG animation, Saphira's voice, and Jeremy Irons were amazing, I feel that the script cut out a lot of the most interesting things found in the book. They could have also found a better actor to portray Eragon, someone who looks, perhaps, a bit younger and who would age to become the young warrior Eragon becomes later on.All in all, I believe the movie killed the fantastical realism Paolini weaved his amazing book with. A true disappointment--especially as I imagine all those fans who would be led off when the taste of the movie and book differ so greatly.",Eragon
1375,sohail_magic23,"Trust me, not a good movie!!!",1,9 November 2008,"i hated this movie. it had so little of the book. i know movies can't fit the entire book in correctly, but they can at least follow some of the book. for example, the Urals didn't appear in daret in the book, but in yazuac. also, in Daret Eragon did't knock out all 12 Urals using the magic word brisinger. he did that in yazuac. The movie didn't even contain all the cities from the book. I think that the director should produce the movie again, because it was a great disappointment to readers and fans of Christopher paolini's novels of the inheritance. and the director didn't even state the right words in the ancient language in the movie. he was sooo totally off track. (this part was really stupid>in the movie: saphira flys up in the sky and thunder strikes in the background and she grows just in 5 seconds into a full grown dragon. in the book: saphira takes time growing into a full grown dragon. the movie director shouldve added more to that part. please, some brave soul she re-produce the movie correctly. (tey should be somewhat like the harry potter series the followed the book) and for those of you who think eragon was a hit, it is because you people haven't read the original book. if you had read the book, you would know how stupid the movie really is. the only good thing about the movie was the actors (especially the person who played Angela, and the person who played Arya. they were awesome), and the graphics. trust me, read the books and then watch the movie. you will know what iam talking about.",Eragon

Hello! And she doesn't have feathers or horns on her head! her picture is on the cover of the first book!, and they forgot the neck spikes.. at least she's blue, but she's no bright-scales as she is the books ~What happened to Katrina? she is a huge deal in Eldest ~Roran was leaving to go to work so he could ask Katrina in good faith to marry him.

But it's like they took the same names and invented a new movie, I would be furious if i was Paolini, They could have made this into an amazing movie like LOTR. Just wow, there is no way they could continue the series, they slaughtered it. They would have to remake the movie, and get better actors. I also thought the movie was way too short, they could have gone for about three hours, then they would've had time to put all the right things into it. All in all I was very disappointed and I feel sorry for Christopher Paolini, it must have hurt to watch his masterpiece killed like that. I hope they redo it and do it justice.",Eragon
1377,Kretgar,Save your money,4,22 December 2006,"First clarifier...NEVER read the books, never knew there WERE books.Second clarifier...did NOT plan on seeing this movie. It was a last minute deal.Now, to the movie. Save your money. At an hour and a half, there is no time to develop anything for the viewer. I was lost to the relationships (who was who's father, friend, lover, etc), and little was done to show any of it. By the end of the movie, I was left wanting for much, much more. I didn't have the chance to develop any sort of feelings for any of the characters, so I didn't share in their desperation, joy, pain...they (the characters) were just ""there"".Too often, the film felt rushed, as it had to reach a conclusion (similar to the constraints of any TV series where all world problems are found, suffered and solved in 1/2 or 1 hour). One moment a character doesn't know who to trust, the next moment he trusts him implicitly. Feelings develop and change on the fly, for all characters. Motivation are glanced over. Fight scenes commenced, and then just a couple of minutes later they were finished. Sorely disappointing movie.The special effects were adequate, but many of the scenes were jumpy and flashed by too quickly to appreciate much.",Eragon
1378,master_of_the_puppets,Watch-able but disappointing for fans of the book.,3,8 December 2008,"I decided to read the book before watching the movie (which I suggest everyone should simply because it is a wonderful story) and I'm glad I did. As a film, it's fairly enjoyable even though the script, plot and the larger part of the acting is a bit of a disaster, and I love all of the older cast, however, it did take me two screenings to come to this conclusion. Contrary to what people on this site are saying, I believe the only convincing performance comes from Robert Carlyle, Rachel Weisz's take on Saphira's voice just didn't do it for me. That said, the first half hour of the film is decent and has a good pace, after that point however, it feels very rushed and with a run time of one hour and forty four minutes, you can't help but think it should have been a three hour flick. Because of this, despite it's brave start, the film feels hollow and even meaningless. Also the first part of the battle which you may have seen clips of in trailers, is an utter disappointment, although the second part boasts terrific CGI and may be worth watching for some.As an adaptation of a novel, in my opinion, the film comes close to topping the insult of Dune. I do appreciate the difficulty of the task and expected many scenes to be cut, however it's safe to say the film retains only names from the book. Almost All Characters, scenes and story differ, with massive chunks missing altogether as they didn't fit the the simpler story of the short film script. This is a shame as the book's plot, although not simple and easily condensed, could have made for a film better than the Lord Of The Rings under Peter Jackson and his team. Although, as stated, all characters appearances aren't based on the book, the biggest failing is the dragon, who's wings have feathers... yes, feathers. Not only does Paolini state over and over that her wings are made of thin membrane, but I can't say I've ever imagined a dragon looking like a huge scaled chicken.Overall it's worth a watch or two but not much more, although if you've not read the book it seems more likely that you will enjoy it.",Eragon
1379,nick_holton,Not as good as expected at all,3,20 December 2008,Being a big fan of the books I admit to being biased. However the film held nothing of the fluency and interest that a reader got from the books.There was no darkness or sense of adventure with even the Ra'zac becoming jumped up ninjas not the creatures perfected to hunt humans souls. The special effects were impressive yet the changes made from the storyline of Eragon make the further films near on impossible without very dramatic changes. I only wish that the director cast etc are changed for Eldest and a Lord of the Rings level group is created as that is what the books deserve. If you have only seen the film please read the book and see why this film enrages me. To me it felt like the director had not even read the book and so left out so many small parts which in Paolini's writing are all intergral to the story.,Eragon
1380,spinner_girl07,This really reeks,1,5 January 2009,"If you liked this hiddeous, unimaginative, disgusting movie version of the one of the best fantasy series of this decade, obviously you haven't even read the back cover of this awesome book. Like everyone else, I was really excited when I heard they were making Eragon a movie. I was thinking, ""this is going to be even better than Lord of the Rings."" Okay, NOT. I was wondering of Christopher even got a say in the making of this movie at all because it totally diverges from the storyline. I can't believe someone got away with releasing this. Most of the characters were a disappointment. From the very beginning of the movie I was disappointed. They even got Eragon's HOUSE wrong. It looked as if he was living in a barn more than a home. And Angela?? That is not the Angela I was picturing, and I doubt Christopher's sister Angela liked that character in the movie any more than I did. The movie is like one BIG accident. oops, the soldiers are ""accidently"" already in Carvahall. oops, Teirm is ""accidently"" one big twig muck instead of this really fortified shipping city. And Saphira ""accidently"" has feathers?!!!! Are you kidding me? They need to remake this movie the way it was supposed to be made. Different director, different Eragon (though it wasn't really his fault), and Definitely different Angela. I mean, this girl looked about 18, not really a woman of knowledge if you ask me.

1381,steve213,The Merry Tale of Eragon,1,18 March 2010,"There was once a band of monkeys. They were all employed to Fox. One day a highly intelligent Fox employee stumbled across a book which he declared proudly ""I will make this book into a film!"" Then the monkeys decided it was a genius plan, so the alpha monkey proclaimed ""Let us make money. I will trust you blindly and give you money. Now go!"" And so the smaller monkeys scurried off.Some of the less-alpha monkeys had been watching Lord of the Rings and the Star Wars saga. The monkeys buzzed happily. Because they had no clue what Eragon was (the monkeys thought it was a dish from Monrovia comprising off crushed grapes and battered pork mince from a cow) they decided that they should base Brom from Obi-Wan. Happily the monkeys drank their banana juice and ate their lemons.Then one techno monkey had a stunning idea. The monkey was truly pleased. He chirped excitedly as he shared the monkeys with a stunning plan. The craze for 'civilian' monkeys now-a-day was big special effects and lots of CGI. The other monkeys listened greedily. They decided this would be the best(est) most amazing(est) movie ever(est?).The monkeys, happy with excitement decided to start. However some of the more greedy monkeys decided to save more money by hiring a few teams to create the dragon. They used a few final cut programs and after affects programs to make the dragon along with some basic animation and art work.Because these monkeys (who were extremely smart) concentrated solely on the CGI. However the silly monkeys blamed a broken calculator for the mistake in budget price. Hurried the enthusiastic monkeys started looking for actors. At first they were about to hire a well known actor but found they had only enough money for one celebrity. Annoyed they asked the alpha male for more money however the alpha monkey was busy so he shooed them away. The monkeys scurried of to tell their leader.Thus the smaller monkeys decided to spend only a minimal amount on actors. They hired mostly soap monkeys for TV shows still learning to tie their shoelaces. Pleased with their work and their still big budget the monkeys happily scurried off.Then came the tricky part. The head monkey was called in and the 7 representing monkeys also joined the meeting. They had to find a script so they thought and thought. And then the leader monkey had a brilliant plan, he would write the script himself. The lower monkeys applauded and shouted. They would save so much money, and some had to hyperventilate - so excited they were.The leader monkey scurried off to find the book (borrowed at the library by a small monkey to save money)- however the lead monkey decided he would waste money eating and sleeping while reading the book, so the brilliant monkey had a extremely intelligent plan. He would read a brief summary from Wikipedia and use that.The monkey hurried off an read to the others a piece HE had made. He yelled joyously ""I suffer without my stone. Do not prolong my suffering."" He received a standing applause. The other monkeys clapped and clapped.Finally the movie was done and the monkeys were excited. They ALL loved the movie and shouted hooray and hooray, and Fox was happy because the profits came in.And so everyone lived happily ever after. The end.",Eragon

I can only hope that some day they will change their minds and make a sequel or 2. They only tell about the young hero, Eragon going from a farm boy to a dragon rider to a hero by helping to defeat the bad king. There are should to be more about how the people continuously win against the king. It's supposed to be the another time for dragon riders. They need a few more dragons and dragon riders.

1383,paulfriday,Worse than expected,2,3 April 2009,"Before seeing this movie I checked out a few reviews and was told not to expect anything. I figured if I set the bar low enough, maybe, just maybe I'd enjoy it as an adaptation of a decent fantasy novel. Well, the bar was set pretty low but nothing could have prepared me for the cheesiness of this. Ed Speleers (Earagon) reminded me of a really bad version of Hayden Christensen in Star Wars 2 , but with even cheesier lines and unconvincing emotions. The story carried on too quickly to explain much (yet I was constantly checking my watch), the director took a little too much liberty with the storyline compared to the book, and the music was too epic and heavy-handed. There were a few too many ill-timed dreamy scenes of sunsets, reunions and other pseudo-emotional things, and as a final insult, the first song in the credits was from Avril Lavigne. Suddenly it was all too clear who the target audience was - pre-teens who wouldn't know a bad movie if it ripped out their braces. Thinking back, a few of the characters did look pretty Emo - a little too much eye shadow perhaps. As for redeeming qualities, these were few and far between. The scenery was nice, which allowed for some breathtaking travel and flying scenes. Unfortunately I couldn't think of a single performance that I liked - even the dragon's. While Sean Connery redeemed 'Dragonheart' with his noble voice as the dragon, Rachel Weisz was not given very good lines with which to work her magic. The only character I didn't mind was Arya, and only because she was easy on the eyes. However, she did a poor job of convincing me that she was a tough elf with a soft spot for Eragon.I think the final nail in the coffin for this movie is that Lord of the Rings was just too good. It set the bar too high for this cheap dragon flick. Other movies that followed LOTR (eg the Witch, the Lion and the Wardrobe) did a decent job in trying to carry on the fantasy genre, but unfortunately this movie seemed to take it a step back.Even if you liked the book, I suggest you skip this movie altogether - it might ruin your perception of Earagon, at least until you forget about the film, that is. ...I surely will.",Eragon

Everyone on here that hated it, did so because they were expecting the detail that went into Lord of the Rings to also go into Eragon. Paolini is a great, but new author without enough recognition to allow for a huge budget busting 3 hour movie. You need to go into it knowing that they had to cut some stuff out. It follows the book-but not down to every last word. Rachael Weiz was terrific as the voice of Saphira and Jeremy Irons was perfect. I do wish they had given him some more screen time...Speleers was memorable and has the potential to grow into a great actor. I hope they give him the chance by filming Eldest.",Eragon
1385,fatboyman,A few diamonds in the rough,6,21 April 2009,"When i went to see this movie i was the only one of my group of friends who had read the book. Afterwards we were talking about the film, and i couldn't believe my ears. They actually liked it. They went on and on about the special effects and how cool saphira looked.I had to admit that the cgi was pretty smooth and the locations stunning, but the plot holes and diversions from the book completely ruined it for me. My biggest gripe is how saphira grew, instead of just scaling up her size throughout the film they wowed the eleven year olds with a flash.The most disappointing character for me has to be Arya, the film never really portrayed why he had to save her and when she woke up she was pretty uninteresting. Iwill admit the fight at the end was exciting, and i loved how durza made a shadow dragon to match eragon, but to me the final fight just seemed like a boss fight. ( i haven't played the game but im guessing you fly behind buildings to dodge his magic and then hit him with a fireball when arya distracts him) The casting for Galbatorix was a fantastic choice and i really enjoyed the brief glimpses of Galbatorix plotting in his throne room, something that the book never really portreyed. ( especially in the first two books) Last of all, the razac dying early on. This may of seemed a stupid way to kill two essential characters from the book but i don't hold a grudge as it allowed Durza to really come in to his own and become the main baddie.In summary, the rule is- if there is a book of it, don't go see it on film. There are exceptions but Eragon isn't one of them.",Eragon
1386,glenny21,The movie is horrible,1,20 May 2009,"This movie is absolutely horrible. It doesn't follow the movie 99.9% of the time. I think some other director should take Eragon and turn it into a movie that follows the book the whole time. They don't need any permission but the permission from Christopher Paolini. They thought that because he was a kid when he wrote it, they could do whatever they wanted. They were wrong. I should contact Christopher Paolini and ask him to make the Eragon movie himself. Some people like it so much, they haven't read the book first, like I did. Then I watched the movie and wished it was better than what it was. Because if they made the Eragon movie to follow the book, they could make an Eldest movie, a Brisingr movie and the last book into a movie. That would be really awesome with all the stuff that happens in the books. Well, tell me what you think at glenny21@live.com",Eragon
1387,mariska_16,It was nice.,7,28 January 2007,"The movie was very nice. The comments I have are:The acting of young people could be better, but it also could have been worse. Saphira's voice was very well chosen. I had a huge problem with the fact that Arya was so quickly recovered. She is almost dead during the book, and at last she lives. I was soooo curious if she would survive. And now she doesn't even (seem to)suffer. Murtaugh's part wasn't big enough also. And that Eragon says 'i come to join you' to the Varden. Ouch. In the book it is made very clear it is best not too choose. But besides this the story is nice and it reminded me not to read the book first.",Eragon
1388,karupt1,Epic Fail.,1,2 August 2009,"I know this is a bit late, but Eragon was just shown on TV recently...and with its viewing came my renewed hatred for it. Im a fan of the book series and when i heard there was a movie coming out, i could not of been happier. For 9 months i fidgeted, waiting for the release of what i thought would be a fantastic movie. Within 5 minutes i was in shock, shock at the characters, shock at the lines, shock at the story (or lack of it). The king was supposed to be a great Evil, made more so by the fact he isn't featured in the first book. Also the fact that upon Eragon getting the egg, everyone somehow knew who he was. Also, and more horrifying then anything was that certain characters that are key to the plot and feature heavily in the second book were simply left out or briefly past over. The Twins being an example. I could go on about what a complete disaster it was but its only making me more angry. Very long story short, its an 'epic' fantasy adventure and requires the same time as one. I want to know what Christopher Paolini REALLY thought of it. I cant imagine he would of actually enjoyed it.",Eragon
1389,the_virus_84,Horrible!,1,28 November 2009,"No relation to the book.. The entire beginning is rewritten.. Nothing is right. Bad acting. The ONLY relation to the book is names of characters and places. The movie makers didn't even bother to have pointy ears for elves and dragons don't become young adults in 10 mins. And this is common knowledge to ANYONE who have EVER read ANY fantasy book. Or seen a movie. Then there is he urgals who are supposed to have almost BLACK skin and not be short bald WHITE men. They also were supposed to have twisted horns.So either the budget was to low, in which case they shouldn't have made the movie. Or they are incompetent which actually would be better.",Eragon
1390,nextorphanborn,Tolerable,6,23 August 2009,"Cinematically this movie lacks for originality. Disregarding the cookie-cutter fantasy aspects that have been done already by masters of the genre the movie borrows heavily from Lord of the Rings: Two Towers. One scene in particular reminded me very much of Saruman looking down on his Uruk Hai (spelling?). As this is not a review of the book I won't comment further on similarities to other fantasy aspects, but with that in mind shouldn't the director of photography attempt to distance them self from Peter Jackson's work? The acting wasn't very bad at all in my opinion. The cast I love! Its a shame that the cast had such a melodramatic, unrealistic, and shallow script. The costuming was pretty good where in fantasy and sci fi costuming can really contribute to cheesiness. When I originally saw the posters, cut-outs, and other promos of this movie I groaned that another awful movie like Dungeons and Dragons would further spoil the credibility of the fantasy genre in literature but I don't think Eragon is that bad at all. Problem is it's not that good either. The first half of the movie flows well but the latter half flashes by and apparently minimizes crucial characters (based on other reviews I've read.) Do not pay to see this movie but if it's on TV and you don't have anything better to do this will occupy some time. A final comment, if you're trying to get your kids or a friend that isn't familiar with the Fantasy genre this is a decent place to start.",Eragon
1391,bahamutthegf2001,Not really worth it,3,18 May 2007,"First of all I am a very big fan of the book Eragon so I guess I am a little critical of a movie attached to this property. OK so the movie follows about a fourth of the plot line of the book (maybe a third I really haven't done the math). The movie is absolutely horrendous, not only could this movie (which will probably be a trilogy considering the books) have been a LOTR or Harry Potter Style epic, but it doesn't even properly set up for the next movie in the trilogy which would be Eldest. Half of the plot lines even remotely important in Eldest were left out, as well as two pretty big Characters (Katrina and Orik). How such wonderful actors as Irons and Malkovich attached themselves to this project after seeing the way this movie turned out is beyond me, they are really the only redeeming qualities in this movie and that is saying a lot about this movie as it is horrible. Do yourselves a favor if you are a fan of the book don't buy this movie if you are curious simply rent it (I bought the 2 disk special having never seen the movie but having read the book).",Eragon
1392,Aydingor,Don't Waste Your Time,3,31 July 2014,"After I finished first book I decided to watch movie. I wish I didn't. Only character names are the same with the book. I still can't find the correct adjective for the badness of this movie. ''Worst movie ever'' is not enough. Worst director, worst scenario, worst costume... I don't understand how to Christopher Paolini let them publish that movie. Never watch it? or need more money? maybe he just want more fame? Maybe it can be good (not 8-9 stars. maybe 6-7) if they make it in 1990. But it's 2006. Peter Jackson make LOTR in 2001. And every year we are watching better effects and scenarios. I can't say any thing about the book. But it should never be filmed that way. or they were just need a better director (I think it was his first director experience.) Any way hope you don't give up read the book after watch this movie.",Eragon

Its just sad how bad this movie was made! Skip it for all its worth, or consider watching it AFTER you've read the AWESOME books. I would not recommend watching it before all the books are read, if you're not into books, just completely skip it, the 90minutes is a waste. The acting is horrible, with the sole exception of the dragon, yes the dragon. The only good role in this movie! The movie lacks some of the important parts of the story, as mentioned in the discussion boards. And the Varden just looks like a pile of gypsies, why is that i wonder. I don't know what the budget was, but it was a total waste of money on this movie-flop! They SHOULD remake it, but by some serious company with a GOOD amount of money, not someone on Uwe Boll's level. (nooffense anyone) Simply put, this movie sucks.",Eragon
1394,guardie333,Good but could be better!,7,26 December 2006,I think even thought the movie did lack some important details it was still good. The filmmakers did not do the book justice. There was to much cut out and somethings just not right. The fight with Durza was a bit lacking and the beginning was a little off. The reason why Roran left was not right and there was no mention of his girlfriend. One thing that was really important that was not included is the Twins. The twins played an important part i thought. Murtagh should have been in the movie more. Also the lack of information about the Dwarfs in Farthen Dur is not the greatest. Broms death was also different then in the book.,Eragon
1395,raintherejected2002,worst book to film movie ever.,1,18 August 2018,Everyone involved in this horrible movie should be ashamed of themselves. There is maybe 2% of the actual book story here.

Instead they went for the second hand dollar bin.,Eragon

I had yet to read the book, and loved anything fantasy. I watched the movie, loving every single second of it.I had loved it so much, that I read the books. The books were billions of times better, but the movie itself was good. For anyone who has yet to read the book will find it enjoyable. I made each and every one of my friends watch it, and they all loved it-but not nearly as much as I had.The actors were pretty decent, with Jeremy Irons as Brom making it exceptional! The only actor I was not too sure with was Chris Egan as Roran. It was a small part, with disappointment.I definitely recommend this movie, but you will notice multiple differences to the book.",Eragon
1397,kaytebarney,Abominable,1,28 March 2010,"Okay, I am sick and tired of people saying that this movie was great. Everyone who has said this either HAS NOT READ THE BOOK or READ IT AFTER THEY SAW THE MOVIE. Do you not understand that your initial impression of the movie as good results in you liking it despite the fact that it is not like the book. I understand it is based on the book; I understand that it will not be the exact same as the book. I understand some things must be cut. However, they did not just cut scenes from the book. They changed the plot. They changed the facts. Roran is a very important part of the second book; because they changed where he went and what happened to him, they will not be able to make a second movie that is like the book at all. Half the second book will be gone, and the main battle will be completely different. Also, Arya is supposed to have NO INTEREST in Eragon. She is obviously into him in the movie. Main characters were left out; key facts were changed. This movie resembles only 20% of the book. It was terrible, and the only reason others find it tolerable is because they haven't read the book so they obviously don't know what they are talking about or they read the book after so they are already under the impression that the movie is good and are stupidly swayed still into thinking that. My advice, read the books before they turn them into a movies. At least then you'll actually know what you're talking about.",Eragon
1398,sky18lark2000,If you loved the book...don't see this movie,5,18 December 2006,"First off, I thought the movie (judged on its own merit) was fair. If I had not read the book before I may have liked it more. I have always loved fantasy movies, but this was just pure butchery.Christopher Paolini wrote an amazing novel. I loved every moment of the book. But like I said the movie just butchered the book.First off, the movie plot. It is as if they took the cliff notes version of ""Eragon"" (not like it was horribly long to believe with), cut THEM in half and made THAT into the movie plot. Granted there is much to cover but so many things were just plain wrong or missing. Things that may not seem needed but really do come back as main parts of the story, if only in the second book.Secondly, it was extremely choppy. There is a lot of time covered in the book. Days are drawn out into pages and pages...and small moments during those days, such as during Brom, Eragon and Saphira's journey in search of the Varden, are imperative to the character development.Saphira's character. Saphira is not just a dragon, she is a soul, a friend and has a love like no other with Eragon. The kind of bond of love that only a dragon and rider can share. The movie made Saphira look more like a pet, trained horse or police dog than a partner in life. Eragon giving her orders during battle, telling her where to go...wrong all wrong.Many facts and details from the book have been completely changed...basically I left the theatre extremely irritated. my favorite part of the whole movie was Saphira's hatching. She was cute, adorable even...but even that had faults.I've learned my lesson. I will no longer go see movies from books I love. Read the book, forget the movie and please someone tell Christopher Paolini to not allowed 'Eldest' to become a book to film catastrophe, at least not like this one!",Eragon
1399,callum_595,What a let down,3,10 December 2010,"I feel compelled ever after all these years to still write a review of this. I happened to by the book 2 years before Eragon the film was realised, so i went to the movies to see what i thought would be at least a quarter of the book. It seems i had to high expectations. The Film is the biggest letdown of such an amazing book. It is like They read the blurb on the back and decided to make the film. Bar the name and the fact it has a dragon in it, you would be hard pressed to guess it was Eragon. Its not just little things they missed out. but 5-6 chapters of a book in one go. But they missed so much out that it did not make sense. I can understand them missing out sections as it is not possible to fit in a whole book for a film. But it was so bad i thought it had fallen asleep and missed an hour. Then there is the little details. OK there not that important. but they are still needed. Like the Urgals not having horns? how many times does the book say about THERE HORNS. yet the director decided that they would be humans and not 8 feet tall monsters like there meant to be. There is also the fact that Eragons house whilst back in Carvahall is meant to be about 2 miles away from the village. Yet in the film its right on the edge. This is a real shame that a book of this quality has been let down by some crap directing. The CGI in the film is pretty good. and the acts are not all that bad. I believe Eragon was miscast but not that bad. All in all, don't pay for this film. if its on TV and your bored out your mind then i say watch it. But if you really want entertainment read the book and you will find a whole new world that never even can up in the film.",Eragon
1400,bigredni,a hard watch if you have read the book,5,4 September 2010,"i give this a 5 because i think the SFX are really good, Sapphira may not look as she is described in the book, but she is well done (really well done), the same for the Ra'zac, and i think the actors did well with what they were given. if you haven't read the book then you will find this a good enough film, short but with good sfx and cinematography. but if you have read the book, then its hard to watch, if feels like someone gave the director a brief summary of the book and then the director passed it to the writer and the writer forgot bits of that summary and made a few changes. like with arya, its like they wrote her part and filmed most of it, then remembered she was supposed to be poisoned so wrote in a different way for her to be poisoned. and what happened to her being an elf? and what happened to farthen Dur and tronjheim? so much for it being in a giant mountain.hmmm altogether its a decent film, but not if you have read the book and not if you're a big fan of the 3 books so far and hoping for a decent sequel.",Eragon
1401,dragonascending,Good film for the genre and Dragon lovers especially,8,25 November 2010,"I have to admit being prejudiced about Dragon films and stories. I'm in my upper 40's now and been a lifelong lover of Dragons, Trolls, Elves, all of it. I read The Hobbit and the Lord of the Rings trilogy when 10 years old, but was hooked on myths and legends since before that. As for Eragon the book, I was a little disappointed in the plot to begin with and wasn't expecting much from the movie. (The succeeding books gained with the author's maturity as a writer.) I had heard a lot of negatives about the movie and waited to see. I eventually did see it on Amazon.com movie download section and liked it enough to buy it on DVD.The only real problem I have with this movie is that much is changed or left out from the original story. AND it always grates my last nerve when film producers and studios take on these projects without giving them due consideration. IE; fans of the novels will want to see a great movie adaptation and they are going to also want to see a sequel IF the first movie was done really well. I do like the film very much but I also wish it had been put together by the director of Harry Potter or The Lord of the Rings. Fantasy literature has a wide audience all over the world. And, as the genre has evolved and matured, so has the audience. It would be nice if studios and productions companies, directors, etc, would cater to the fans rather than a perceived box office revenue. A well done film will bring in the revenue. It shortchanges the author and the audience when you get a taste of a book on film and then are left hanging.",Eragon

The cgi was as good as it can be never looking fake,the Dragon looked fantastic and Robert Carlyle was excellent as Durza. I have never read the book so in that respect I do not know how it compares. The only negative comment I would make is that they would have been better adding a few extra minutes to flesh out the minor characters more,as we don't get the chance to care enough about them when there lives are in peril.Perhapses they might release a extended edition on DVD? Please give Eragon a chance I have seen far worse movies this year.",Eragon
1403,greywolf584,All I can say is what the HECK,5,16 December 2006,"Be warned ***SPOILERS AHEAD*** I know that any one who has seen Lord of the Rings or even the Harry Potter movies will say they don't go to the book exactly but they were close enough to make sense. Where this movie only dabbles in plots but says nothing of the ones that are needed for later in the stories. But from what I see the screen writer and Director need new professions, I mean this movie should have been more like the book than a summary of it. Now I know that you can not make a movie exactly like the book for the movie would be in some cases six hours or more long. This is what I mean.....I thought the Dwarfs in the books were supposed to be short in stature, and that the Elves were to have pointed ears (the elf one was minor I know). And as for the movie I thought Murtagh was to be captured at the end and that Ajihad dies well did he or not it just lets the his and other characters kind of how shall we say just disappear & Eragon, the injury from Durza to Eragons back I thought they weren't able to completely heal the wound by magic which they never show and I thought it was to be more painful for him when he moves I mean you don't just jump up and run around when you were barely moving a second ago. You know this list could go on but I don't want to write a novel of my own here. But seriously I mean what the heck was this guy thinking when he wrote the screen play and the director what is your problem. Before you both decide to do a movie next time read the book and try to understand it before you film it. The only Positive in the movie which is the only reason I gave it a five out of ten, is that that the Computer Graphics are cool I like how the Dragon is brought to life as well as Durzas little nasty minions.",Eragon

They had no right to even give it the same name. It is a disgrace to have THIS with such a wonderful book. And to top it all off, they left it with absolutely no way to continue on to Eldest and Brisingr. A lot of book to movie attempts are not like the book but are still good in there own right. Well this isn't one of them! The characters were all bad casting and didn't act like the characters in the book did. They left important parts out of the movie and that were crucial to the story line.

But this may be a little harsh.Paolini's novels are an excellent read and I'd certainly recommend them, but the movie has an equally as compelling plot. The relationships between the characters were well captured, though different from the ones we've read about. The acting was also very impressive even if the lines were a little dull.I was pleasantly surprised by two things. I had expected corny dragons and bad acting. The CG and the acting were remarkable though. The plot might have felt a little rushed, but as adults we can't complain because this movie was marketed towards children. Also, the movie makers decide to foreshadow some things from the sequel more than Paolini did in the novel. It was actually more interesting that way.Overall, a good movie. I was disappointed at first when I realized that it wouldn't be like the book at all, but allow yourself to enjoy it anyways, fans. You won't be too disappointed.",Eragon
1407,asphodelli,"oh, wow. um.",1,25 December 2006,"Yet ANOTHER movie that feels as if the filmmakers read the summary on the book jacket and thought, 'Well, no use reading all of those PAGES. plot just gets in the way.' The movie could not be much less like the book if it tried. Te book is okay, its main qualifier as a best-seller being the impressively young age of the author. Yes, the plot is generic, yes, the dialogue is not the best ever written. But it is an engaging read, and it has the nuances of plot and the characterization necessary to create empathy with, well, the characters- that is what makes any adventure fantasy different from another. The movie manages to take all of the interesting details and snuff them dead. The CGI on Sapphira is so impressive that i didn't even notice it, which was great. The costumes were gorgeous. The sets were pretty, despite the fact that they were incredibly repetitive and bore no resemblance to anything described in the book. And that is pretty much it. Remember those fan-favourite characters from the books? Jeremy Irons rocks pretty hard as Brom, despite the fact that all mystery and subtlety is stripped from his character. Remember Murtagh and Angela? Hope you don't like them too much. Garrett Hedlund does what he can with his six minutes of screen time. Joss Stone never stood a chance- the character's setting and presentation are horribly mangled. Solembum is gone, Jeod is gone, Teirm itself is gone. Orin is gone. The Varden barely exist. Oh, but hey! We have TONS of Arya! Unconsciousness what? Oh right! -i- was unconscious- the pacing manages to be quite slow, despite a mere hour-and-a-half running time.Oh yeah, and there is huge emphasis placed on the idea that if a rider dies, his dragon will die too. But not vice-versa. Got that? No? Well, that's okay. It will be reiterated every seven minutes just in case you forget. I don't know what we're supposed to learn from that.You know what? Go and see this, if you were really planning on it. It's pretty enough to look at, Robert Carlyle is totally wasted as an awesome villain, you get to hear John Malkovitch do the same scene about four times, and there are attractive people in leather. Just remember not to read the book first. It will save you from a great deal of disappointment.",Eragon
1408,ariaparia,"Wonderful casting, great set, dreadful script, horrible direction.",4,9 April 2011,"Neither of the intriguing themes of the Eragon books' are sufficiently covered in the film. The politics, the nature of the magic, the development of the main character from a snotty teenager to a reflected and responsible magician and his friendship with the dragon Saphira are almost entirely left out of the plot. Much could be gained in focusing on the latter, like it later was done in the animated film ""How To Train Your Dragon"". Instead, the film makers has reduced the story to poorly planned fire spitting dragon battle action.It may not come as a surprise that a movie based on a book fails to meet the dedicated readers expectations. Many film makers still manages to pull it off by making their own version of the original story. Sadly, the film makers of Eragon has done no such thing and the movie does not stand on its own.The script gave me the feeling that somebody had not done their homework. Or was all the interesting stuff cut out? Either way, the direction could have been better. The dialog flows more easily in Norwegian films from the seventies. The set design and the casting gave me high hopes during the first couple of minutes and managed to create an atmosphere similar to that of the book. The fall all the greater when it dawned on me that this was not a film worth seeing. Despite this, the set and casting made me want to endure it, just for the visuals sake.To sum up: Wonderful casting, great set, dreadful script, horrible direction. To me it looks like the film makers totally ran over the young and gifted author.",Eragon
1409,Charizma,"A good movie, but not by the book",6,4 January 2007,"Not being a huge fantasy-fan, I went to see this movie without having read the book. I didn't have a lot of expectations either, not knowing what the movie was about.To be honest, I liked the movie. We, the watchers, are thrown into the story right at the beginning, and it kept me interested. There were plenty of action and I enjoyed it as a good popcorn-flick. But here comes the lowdown...I decided to buy the book upon watching the movie. If you've read the book and then watched the movie, I understand why you are disappointed. I could hardly recognize the book from the movie and vice versa. There has been so many changes, for instance the death of Eragons uncle, the relationship between Eragon and Brom, and Roran has a bigger part in the book than in the movie. If you expect the book, you WILL be disappointed. If you don't expect the movie to follow the storyline of the book, you might be in for a treat. I believe the storyline was changed so much because it could have been difficult to film scenes described in the book. If they followed the book completely for instance the part where Eragon gets his fortune told, it would take ages to tell the story. I quite liked the part in the movie where Joss Stone told his fortune without having a bigger part of the movie. A lot of it would take lots of time to film, not to mention that it'd cost millions of money to put everything on tape, and I believe that's why the changes were made.As far as acting goes, it was OK. Jeremy Irons was great, as always. I wish John Malkovich had had much more screen-time, I liked what I saw of him even though it wasn't much. It was a lot of fun to see Robert Carlyle in such a different role, I enjoyed his performance as well. Saphira was a great character too. Now, Edward Spellers accordingly beat out a heck of a lot of young boys to get the role as Eragon. Did he deserve it? I don't know. He wasn't horrible, but he didn't stand out either. Luckily I hadn't seen him in anything before, so I could more easily picture him as Eragon. I have to give the guy a break, though, this was his first big, no scratch that, HUGE performance, in a HUGE production, and considering that, he did very well. I'm sure he will get better as he gets older, he's got the potential.When that's said, when I went out of the movie theater I couldn't help but linking this movie to ""LOTR"". The movie is more LOTR-like than the book is, in my opinion anyway, and I believe the producers wanted this movie to be more like LOTR to achieve more success. There's not a single doubt that the LOTR-movies are amazing fantasy-movies, or just amazing movies period. That's just my two cents, though. For the future, they should stick more with the book and not make up scenes that weren't even in the book and make these movies less similar to the LOTR-movies.",Eragon
1410,simmtek,Saw this film with children,5,22 December 2006,"Let me say first my children love dragons, hence why they went to see this film.My children liked it, I thought it was done badly, not knowing much about ERAGON at first.This film was a cheap cheap version Dungeons and dragons. Lets just say Jertemy Irons is a good actor and played his part well, without him the film would of been terrible. (He seems to do well in films with Dragons).Also having a good actress like Racel Weisz like play the voice of the dragon was a nice concept, the worse bit was the bad US accent that she had to do, made me think the voice did not fit the dragon at all.This film could of been more much more better. At the end of the day my children liked it, but they are both under 10yrs old.So any teenager or adult would find this boring, Robert Carlysle looked really good as the magician, but not many words for him to say accept some cheesy evil lines.Acting was OK, but Jeremy Irons stole the show and made it interesting",Eragon
1411,pea_chee_keen-1,Why compare the two?,9,12 April 2007,"I believe that had this movie come out before LOR, more people would have excepted it better. This movie is definitely not for the LOR geeks (which I am not one of by the way) but for people who felt the movie versions of LOR tedious and some what boring, but well acted. If you must compare it to a book or storyline (other than it's own) it would be a mix of The Dragon Riders of Pern by Anne McCaffery AND LOR. I feel that where LOR failed, this succeeded, with great chemistry between the characters, Jeremy Irons plays well as Brom, Ed Spiller as Eragon was a bit earnest, but it was acceptable and actually a bit authenticating for his character. The CG was fantastically done and entertaining and Rachel Weisz as Saphira's voice was great, she gave her character and depth a la Sean Connery in Dragonheart. Overall I feel that this was a movie worth my money.",Eragon
1412,kai-sc30,Eragon,1,13 February 2013,"The movie Eragon is almost a completely different story than the book that it is based on. The book is about 544 words and the movie is only 104 minutes long, so obliviously there is going to some shortcomings in the movie. But compared to other movies that are based off of books, this movie was a huge disappointment! The movie put the story together with a series of scenes that tell the story in a choppy manner. If you have never read the book then you might be able to understand the story and like it, but for those that have read the book, you will basically want to stop the movie not even half way through. The book is long because the author, Christopher Paloini, put an immense of detail into the story and in the movie there is almost no detail. It seems as if the producers wanted to get the story across without any embellishments, in which case they accomplished their goal. There is only two characters that I thought were portrayed well: the dragon Shaphira and the Razac. The Razac were hideous and deadly looking and Saphira was beautiful, graceful, and strong which is how she is portrayed in the book as well. Overall I would say this movie would be a one-time view, nothing more.",Eragon
1413,glenny212,"OK, My review of this movie.",1,26 May 2011,"OK. So this movie is probably the crappiest movie I have ever seen to be honest. I am a guy who reads the books before watching the movies. I followed the books ever since the first one came out. They were good. And the producer who made this movie totally slaughtered Eragon. If you watch this movie, you will probably be ready for hell. That is how bad this is. The makers of this movie probably skipped 70% of the journey, Saphira grew up way too fast, and they never went through the Hadarac Desert like they were supposed to. It was missing several characters such as Orik and the Twins. Arya was supposed to be unconscious for the whole trip to the Varden. Jeod was never even in the movie and that is the city where Eragon was supposed to meet Angela for the first time. Durza was riding......i don't know what the heck that thing was, but he was never supposed to be riding anything. I am telling you guys. This movie sucks. If you haven't watched it already, don't even bother, It will probably make your life sad and miserable. This movie is so bad, it makes Satan look like an angel. I am not even kidding. It is so poorly made that it makes an un-sculpted mound of clay look like a beautiful masterpiece. I have nothing more to say on this matter. Plz comment on this review.",Eragon
1414,kurgan-1,how to destroy a good story,1,11 February 2007,"it would be really nice if the screenwriter and director would actually read the book, instead of ripping out 10 random pages before producing a movie.A lot of the original storyline has been altered (read: simplified) and the impression of the movie is *fragmented* nothing is really explained so you find yourself wondering about what and why, and if you read the book you know why, but everything is out of context! I found the acting OK, and the effects good, but that director and screenwriter should be put in the deepest dungeon, and never be let out! To top off this of, the end titles are accompanied by a totally out of place piece of Avril Lavigne pop music?!!??? Such a waste!",Eragon
1415,seansmith-157-292697,Utter disappointment!,1,11 September 2011,"I have never been more disappointed than when I walked out the theater after this movie. I am a huge fan of the books, so, as many have said, this movie was a pathetic excuse for a film based off of Christopher Paolini's outstanding book.First of all, the second half of the movie was completely different from the novel; in fact, the last battle had absolutely no similarity whatsoever with the book! Now I know some of you are saying ""but, many movies like Harry Potter are not like the books either."" okay, so maybe in Harry Potter, they didn't specify that Harry's potions textbook was red, but did they leave out half the main characters in Harry Potter? Did they leave out some of the most important settings? Did they make up events that never even happened in the book?! Yeah, I didn't think so. The point is, for anybody who has read the books, this movie will be a total letdown. Not to mention that the screenplay was pitiful, the casting for almost all characters was very poorly done, and the movie was about an hour shorter than it should have been!For a book with so much material, depth, and character development, this movie was a complete, Uh, I'm starting to run out of negatives, but anyways, this movie was a piece of crap. Perhaps if the film was remade by the people who made LOTR, then it would be sensational.",Eragon
1416,GermanSeabass,Sub-par; disappointing,2,8 March 2007,"Despite its CGI-based visual and graphic appeal, Eragon offers little substance to relish if one has enjoyed the book of identical title. One of the most remarkable feats of the 104-minute film is the way it tears away the delicately constructed plot devices, butchers key plot elements from the book and replaces them with forced action and dialogue. Although the casting of the main characters, Eragon (Edward Speleers), Brom (Jeremy Irons) and Arya (Sienna Guillory) is fairly fitting, it does little to levitate the unjust adaptation of the book and distract from the B-movie look. Stefen Fangmeier undoubtedly did his best to direct the talent according to screenplay, yet accuracy seemed to have been a topic of unimportance in the conversion from book to script - despite the necessity to remove certain scenes for the sake of time. This, however, does not make up for stripping the story of its mysterious appeal, its dramatic undertone and its stirring depth of narrative development. Thank you, Peter Buchman. As expected for an ""epic"" film, the orchestral score undulates between cliché disharmony and excessive beat for dramatic impact, mirroring the action in a dim light instead of enforcing the mood in a stylistic manner. The one category the film does succeed in, however, is special effects. Saphira, the digitally created dragon, is a masterpiece and deserves compliments, as well as the many hundreds of fire, water, landscape and magic effects that naturally flow through the realms of Alangaesia. CafeFX, ILM and many others did a fine job to enhance the film's majestic feel - the very thing that got lost in all other creative departments. So much could have been done with this movie - even at the sacrifice of pulling a Peter Jackson and ending up with a 3-hour film. At least that would have done the previously establish story justice instead of tossing it into infamy or, at most, leaving it forgotten as any other cinematic flop.",Eragon
1417,PointXnoXReturn,Not a bad movie at all,10,20 December 2006,"Okay, so I had high hopes for this movie. I went into the theatre thinking ""oh! Yes! Eragon movie!"" and I left disappointed. I was angry as all get out. It was NOTHING like the book, it just followed the main plot (but it wasn't as bad as Ella Enchanted).But I willed myself to see it again. I wanted to see it with the book completely blocked from my memory, and in the end I liked it. The overall plot was not filled with too many holes, and a person could sit down and watch it without reading the book and not get very confused. Also, the cinematography was beautiful. There were very nice landscapes used, and the graphics weren't that obvious and cheap. Saphira was absolutely BEAUTIFUL, and a magnificent job was done on her. Lastly, the casting was awesome, despite Arya and Angela (even though she wasn't in there for very long). I think that they could have had much better people to play both of them, as their acting was not exactly up to par.So, in conclusion, don't expect the book, but leave an open mind. It's a great movie, and I can't wait for it to come out on DVD.",Eragon
1418,normandbutter,Rachel Weisz's voice over for the dragon is literally the only good acting the film has to offer.,1,16 December 2006,"Crude, unimaginative adaptation of Christopher Paolini first novel is a bad joke from top to bottom. The screenplay is a joke, with major characters missing from the original novel and the acting from almost everybody in the film is down right horrible and that's really because most of the roles are miscast to begin with. Jeremy Irons makes an grant effort with what he has to work with but he's let down by the script and the bad performances of his co-stars and the only solid piece of real acting comes from the voice over work of Rachel Weisz, who gives the dragon Saphira enough charm, charisma, and strong will to make her the only believable and likable character in the entire film. That's in itself a great accomplishment considering the fact that script really does not even try to do that with itself.",Eragon

In some dialogs he was experience less. I can't remember another movie where this actor participated. perhaps I don't know to much of cinema.I advise you to see the movie, but don't expect to much.

As a movie, this was pretty bad, as an adaptation: horrific. There was no character development, and very little was explained. Saphira looked pretty cool, and Eragon was eyecandy, but otherwise, there were no redeeming qualities. Personally, I think the author was so thrilled to get a movie offer that he just said ""yes"" fearing that there would be no other offers. It was choppy, and since when do elves have REGULAR ears!? I don't think I have ever seen a depiction of a elf without pointy ears, Eragon was a first in that category. Major key points and characters were cut, and Durza just looked over done.

I wanted to love this movie but found myself board and not fulfilled as I had hoped. The character development was shallow and the wondrous story was destroyed. There was an absolute lack of emotion at all, and I felt no connection to the people on screen. For those of you who have read the book, I am saddened to say you will waste your time if you bother setting foot in a theater that is playing Eragon. I gave this movie a 5 for effort more than anything else as it does have a few scenes I enjoyed. Enter at your own risk! But your better off reading the book and then waiting for the Movie on DVD.

1422,Tazdude24,Don't listen to the over-analysis of false reviewers,8,21 December 2006,"I have read the book, and loved it. I read all these reviews saying how horrible the movie was and luckily, i took none of them to heart. If you read this book and honestly think that they will fit EVERYTHING you like about it into a 1hr and 45 min movie, than something is terribly wrong. The graphics were great, the acting (ESPECIALLY for a newbie) was not as bad as most would have you believe. Jeremy Irons was great. This is what we call a FANTASY movie, meaning it requires some suspension of disbelief if you are going to enjoy it. They changed a few parts yes, but they had too. DEAL WITH IT. If they had kept specific parts from the book, in the movie they would have spent and extra Hour trying to explain it to those who have never read the book. So they did a great job in changing what they needed to, to get the story across. Don't let these obnoxious critics turn you away from this film. Not even a degree in film can teach someone about simply being entertained in a movie theater. They are not trying to win an Oscar here, just trying to tell a story of fantasy and magic. Im sorry it broke the hearts of so many because everything wasn't the way you had it pictured in your mind. There ARE elves, there ARE dwarfs. They are not the same as you expect from Lord of the Ring's, but that makes it that much better. The races on this world are like that of our own but with different names. Like American, African, Asian. They don't have to look completely different to be different. There isn't a law saying all dwarfs look like this, all elves look like this. Get over it. For those who haven't read the books, see the movie first, then read the book. It will be that much better for you. The original Star Wars was criticized just like this, and most can see how wrong they were. I sincerely hope these half minded people don't prevent the second film from being made and I cant wait to see it. Enjoy this film, get involved in the story and be taking in by the characters. Judge for yourself, but go in with NO expectations. Make up your own mind, and you just might find a entertaining 1 hour and 45 min ahead of you.",Eragon
1423,Jojoferrara,A big disappointment,2,26 December 2011,I am almost through the second book in this series Eldest and am in awe of such a talented young writer. Now I usually brush off most people who say a movie is not true to novel. It is very difficult to include all of a novel into a movie and therefore much must be left out. However changing a story as they have Eragon is sooooo disappointing. this could have been done so much better than it was. a few of my biggest issues are:1. How can they bring Roran back into the story when the movie had no hint of Katrina and his motives to save her. 2. what of the Dwarfs. there is no mention of them and the implied Dwarfs in the movie had no physical representation of the ones described in the book. 3. it's not Saphira that gets injured in battle but Eragon. 4. and what about his training with the Elves. A very significant part of Eldest.I could go on and on but the message is clear. this is one of the worst movie adaptations I have ever seen. I an understand why Eragon II hasn't come out.,Eragon

You have John Malcovich slumming it and absolutely chewing on the scenery, ditto Jeremy Irons, a lead who's cute but couldn't act his way out of a wet paper bag, and every trope and cliche known to fantasy movie fans. The book it was ""based"" on (in the very loosest possible sense) is quite good, but this corrupts the plot in ways that must make the author cringe. The most egregious is the ""romance"" between the titular character, a boy of about 16 with all the lack of wisdom and maturity that implies, and a hundreds of years old elven princess - that she would even look at this child twice is just laughable. Still, if you're looking for a mindless unintentionally funny diversion, Eragon might just be your jam.",Eragon

People have discriminated against little mistakes made during the movie but i can tell you if you had to go and watch all of these new movies i can guarantee that there will be as many mistakes if not more. Eragon is a movie that keeps the viewers on the edge of there seats every minute pf the movie. the characters have been portrayed by some of the most respected actors in the industry.

1429,nickymickyhicky,Absolutely hideous to watch.,1,13 January 2012,"This movie actually made me want to cry it was that bad. It takes an brilliant book and runs it's reputation into the dirt.The movie consists of constant one-liners and such a weak plot that a fourteen-year-old could have written a better interpretation of the novel. I am personally a fan of the novel, and had high expectations for the movie. I tried to like it, I really did. But it was beyond likable, I honestly have never been more disappointed with a movie in my life.With over 50 variations of plot between the movie and the book it's a wonder how, even if they did manage to scrounge the money together, they would make a sequel that would resemble Eldest (the novel) in any way. The novel ends with Arya and Sapphira saving Eragon's life and him receiving a vision of The Cripple Who Is Whole. Then (in Eldest), Eragon, Arya and others go to the elven cities so Eragon can learn how to be a rider. In the movie, it ends with Arya riding away. One of the largest parts of the travel time in Eldest is about Eragon and Arya growing closer, which would be impossible considering in the movie she leaves Farthun Dur early.A few other things: 1 - In the novels, Arya has no romantic attraction towards Eragon until the final book 2 - The movie leaves out several main characters who go on to be very important parts of the novels (Nasuada, Orik, Horst)On top of all that, the transformation that Sapphira undertakes to change from an infant to an adult dragon was so infuriatingly stupid!

That is to say, the lowest score it can get without giving me a feeling when it's over that I just wasted two hours watching it. Eragon had OK acting, but did a poor job of explaining character development/motivations/etc and also fell short in the dialogue department. Maybe I'm just a sucker for the classic fantasy ""farm-boy whose parents get killed becomes the unlikely hero who's destiny is to save the realm"" plot, but I was able to get past some of the flaws of this film and actually enjoy watching it on DVD.To all of you who are ranking movies like Eragon as a 1, where do movies like Battlefield Earth or Gigli fit on your scale?

Then the running time came out, all hope for this movie in my eyes had faded completely. But no... I was amazed by the brilliant landscape, the special effects, and Oh yeah, the way they brought it to life on the big screen, with such brilliance that you could hardly believe your eyes.

Though I hadn't read the book until afterward, I was able to follow and thoroughly enjoy this film. The visual effects are positively stunning, the characters entirely believable, and the lore of the story keeps any viewer locked into Paolini's intricate plot.I suppose if a reader had gone to the theater expecting a Lord of the Rings-esquire, ten-hour saga, this would be slightly disappointing. After reading the novel, I'll admit that many of their adventures were condensed or left out overall, but it is a sacrifice any screen writer has to make to keep their audience's attention. This film has much potential to become one of the classic epics of our generation. Things get better as they go, and if Hollywood has the patience to support and enjoy the next part in the trilogy, things could look up.

It could have made a great series and made tons of money for Hollywood but not now. I don't think they even read the book, or skimmed it for that matter. All they did was take the plot line and ruin it. It is a long and great book that at the least needed to be 150 minutes. There is to much to put in the movie for only 100 minutes. The characters weren't even developed, giving you know reason to feel anything for them. They give you like three minutes to see a character and get to know them. What about their back history? The only thing that is enjoyable in the movie is Saphira. They make her look amazing in the movie and Rachel Weisz's voice as her was perfect. Nobody could have been better for it. In fact it was the only thing that made the movie good. I also liked how they did the Shade. I found his and Eragon's final battle was better done in the movie than in the book. So, the only good things that the movie delivered were the Shade and the voice of Saphira.So, I advise you to read the books and not watch this. But if you do read the books and go see the movie don't expect to see it do the book justice.Hollywood really messed up on this. They could have had a hit series bringing in lots of money like Harry Potter but not now. However, I would love them to remake it and do good. No one will remember this if you do good.

Unfortunately, I was disappointed by a fantasy-epic turned a little bit too family friendly.From the beginning, the acting of newcomer Ed Speleers as farm boy Eragon will make you grimace. For some reason, even in the most serious and dire of moments (well, as dire as this movie lets them become for a PG rating) he can't seem to wipe the stupid grin off his face.All of the edge from the story is gone. What could have been a tale of hope in a time of dark despair, of fighting against all odds in a beautiful, but ravaged, country instead becomes a quick jaunt of an adventure through the countryside. There seems to be no concept of time passing or character development, and there are many, many holes in the plot that would be hard for a viewer who didn't read the book.I'm hoping this series might undergo a change of director, a la the third Harry Potter, that could save the trilogy. It's a worthwhile story, and shouldn't be compared too much with Star Wars or Lord of the Rings. Sure, there are similarities, but what story about a rags-to-glory epic hero doesn't have similarities?

1438,imdb-3500,"A ""cool"" disappointment",4,30 December 2006,"I read the book and had some expectations, however I tried to watch the movie without being too judgmental. I must say I was gravely disappointed.The introductory voice in the beginning of the movie draws on and if the director was afraid the movie was going to be too long here is where they could have cut it. The movie is very fragmented and hard to follow for someone who has not read the book. For someone who read the book it is and annoying movie that frequently strays from the book. It seems the movie was made only for the sake of making a new cool fantasy movie and not for the sake of the storyline. The story jumps from battle too battle ignoring what should go in between. Broms character in the book is vividly described as the local storyteller with which Eragon has grown up and loves to listen too. In the movie he strikes you as a local drunk with a big mouth. Eragons cousin is afraid to be recruited into the kings army by recruiters that doesn't even exist in the original story. It seems the recruiters have replaced the peddlers which brings news and supplies too the villagers. On top of this there's no crossing of deserts, no pointy ears on Arya identifying her as an elf. Eragon doesn't chase after his uncles killers, he never meets a where-cat, he is never imprisoned by the shade and Arya is not unconscious. Eragon never learns to draw water from the ground in the desert. Brom never teaches him sword fight or words of magic, instead he tells him where to find the Varden and then dies by taking an arrow for Eragon when suddenly fighting the shade! The dwarfs have pots on their heads and the twins who in the book have a significant role intruding upon Eragons mind are non existing in the movie. The actors I agree with are Brom and Saphira. Brom makes a good impression even though there is no character buildup. Saphira makes an authentic impression, but the voice strikes me as a bit mature for a fledgling dragon. All in all, a cool movie missing all the important details that sets the mood. The result is a fragmented disappointment with no clear storyline. As Cristopher Paolini originally wrote his book Eragon because he wanted to make it a movie it is difficult to understand this disappointing result. The director seems to have forgotten the importance of building characters and setting, instead the only focus is on cool epic fantasy battles without any real meaning. The sad part is that this movie could have been a GREAT movie with little effort if it would have kept to the original storyline.",Eragon
1439,jploaiza,They just Killed Eragon,1,3 July 2012,"I was unable to keep watching for more than 20 minutes of this film, they just kill the whole history. I think this is a bad joke and a disrespect to Paolini's hard work and for all the books fans.They somehow transform a great history, to a piece of c**p, which is doom because they will not film any other book because this was so bad I hardly think they will ever recover the money they spend on the first one.Don't waste your time, if you really want to understand what I'm talking about just read the books, all of them, they kept me wake up till very late on working days, amazing books, definitely a great history.PS: ARYA is not BLOND! for god sake!, did they EVER read anything of the book? or they just take the name of the book and use it for an entirely different history, because it feels they did that.you don't go and cast a brunet to play Galadriel (LOTR), what Gimli will ask her as a gift when the fellowship leave the forest? a dark hair? no he ask for a golden hair... Blond is Blond, Brunet is Brunet... just deal with it, it does not make it cooler because she is blond, is LAME.",Eragon
1440,iamtimtam,Please Please Please remake it...,2,9 July 2012,"I went to see this at the movies when it was first released. I went with my parents and we had all just read the book before seeing the movie.At the time I walked out and I was so overwhelmingly disappointed that I just couldn't stop bagging the movie for how unlike the book it is. I still feel this way. I know that the movie is ""based on"" the novel Eragon, but I would think to be ""based on"" something you need to take a little more than just the characters names. The amount of story missing from the movie made it impossible for this movie to become a franchise and continue with the following stories. The screen writer had simple missed and changed far to much to be able to continue to the next story. So much so that I wonder if Christopher Paolini was consulted at all, as he would have been able to tell the screen writer that cutting this part or that (or the hole story line) would jeopardise the next film. Not to mention the minor details cut from the costumes like the elf's don't even have pointy ears in the movie and Arya was also dressed more like an American Indian than an elf, not to mention being blonde, and the grand fortress of Farthen dur which is so deep that even a dragon can not fly high enough to cross and so wide that it takes a day to walk across it is just a small hill that looks about the size of my back yard...I agree with the reviews that the CGI for Saphira was amazing, but it is painfully obvious that the whole budget was spent on this and a couple of bigger named stars, instead of the sets to give the film the grandeur of the book.I am hoping that at sometime soon the film will be remade with a new screen play. I would love nothing more than to have a new movie each year to look forward to and the books are so fabulous and have such a cult following that the potential for this to be awesome is certainly there.We all know that he grandeur of a story can be done more justice, just take the other big franchises of the last decade as example... I am sure that with a leaf out of the Lord Of the Rigs, or Even Harry Potter success stories that this could be made so much better.Please Please Please remake it, bigger, better and Stronger...",Eragon
1441,JesusFreak47,"If you haven't read the book, Eragon is great. If you have, it is the most disappointing movie on the planet",3,15 December 2006,"The Book Eragon was utterly amazing, and that's not even an exaggeration. The movie, however, is much different from the book. Some of the characters and settings are not congruent with descriptions the book, not to mention all of the in formation left out and scenes changed. Many characters (namely all) are not in the movie enough for their connection and relation to Eragon to be fully realized, as they will be needed if a Edest is made into a movie, especially Roran. The most frustrating of all is when they add in information about people's past (Brom)to something that would obviously not be part of his character in the book.This has to be one of the worst book to movie film I have seen. It is beaten only by the movie The Visitation off of the novel by Frank Peretti.I recommend this movie only for people who have not read the book, and I warn those who have, that it will fall very short of all expectations.",Eragon
1442,chkneram,Slightly worse than laughable,1,22 December 2006,"I really wish there was an option for 0 stars.Although I'm a fan of the book series, I understand that their derivative nature can be viewed by movie audiences to be the mark of an inferior work. Also, I checked online ahead of time to see the differences between the book and the movie, so that I would not be in for any surprises. All in all, I had prepared myself to see a terrible, terrible movie, which was OK, maybe I could laugh at it.However, the 104 minutes of soul-crushing, intelligence-insulting, why-didn't-I-stay-at-home-and-cut-myself-instead train wreck which was 'Eragon' has robbed me of the ability to laugh at anything, at least temporarily. Incomprehensible choices in adapting the book for film aside, the movie was horrible on its own. Everything, I mean everything, was bad. The acting was painful, the swiss-cheese plot was incoherent, and the music made every scene feel like the ""heartfelt-talk-from-Dad"" part at the end of a 'Full House' episode. The carefully developed characters from the book were hacked to pieces and replaced with cardboard stock-fantasy characters. I really could not have cared less for the safety or well-being of any of the heroes; Brom's death brought the joy of knowing that the movie must be nearing its end. The villains became music video caricatures of stereotypical 1980's fantasy 'Masters of the Universe' villains. The scenery was varied so little that I would believe the entire story took place within a 5-square-mile area, far from the epic journey which supposedly took place. Also, why do the bad guys have to live in dark, dreary and dank fortresses of evil, covered by the requisite stormy weather? I'm pretty sure the book didn't mention anything like that. In fact, what bothers me most about the movie is that it will give people who've never read them such a negative opinion of the books.Jeremy Irons tried, I'll give him that. Rachel Weisz did good. The dragon looked all right, I guess. My personal opinion is that the lack of elves, dwarfs or proper Urgals was an attempt on the filmmaker's behalf to differentiate 'Eragon' from 'Lord of the Rings', which, if they had just done their damn job right, would have happened anyway.The one redeeming feature of 'Eragon' is that because of such severe edits from the book, a sequel is out of the question. After all, with the Ra'zac dead, Roran a coward, Sloan dead and Katrina non-existent, the Twins and Orik non-existent, Oromis never having contacted Eragon, Arya and Eragon in love, Galbatorix apparently (at the end) coming after Eragon himself, and the jewel- and gold-clad Varden apparently not lacking for money, what story lines from 'Eldest' remain unruined? Bottom line: this movie is difficult to sit through, and decidedly way too bad even to laugh at.",Eragon

I saw the trailer and immediately wanted to see it because it involved one of my favorite mystical beings, Dragons. First to say, the graphics in this movie were well done, perhaps almost better than King Kong, with the dinosaur comparisons.Second, the acting was horrific, almost something that you would expect to see in a movie like Scary Movie where everything is a spoof. For a second, I thought that they *were* spoofing something the way everything built up.Third, it was rushed too much, and the audience does not have ability to focus on the characters and learn more about them. Also, the battle scenes are extremely short, and after seeing the King rip down the curtain revealing a black dragon, you think ""Are they kidding? They're making ANOTHER movie?"" But... The movie was not ALL that bad. It's great for young children, who enjoy a cheesy plot, buuuuut, sci-fi seekers, this movie is NOT for you.",Eragon

In 2007 I saw the movie: and when I saw it: it made me glad that I didn't finish the book ( I have now started to read the books and am currently reading Brisingr and am thoroughly enjoying every page). The movie has such gaping plot holes, and is telling an almost completely different story! The main problem is that they have tried to compress 2 books (those were the only ones out at that time) as well as finish an unfinished story into an hour and forty minutes worth of footage. Most of the story feels rushed and incomplete, the characters are the very opposite of engaging (to me at least). And on the whole: the only actor who gives a half- decent performance is Saphira. Due in no small part that she is voiced by Rachel Weisz. All in all: if you can't afford to buy the books (presuming that is the reason for why you want to watch the film) : just rent them from a library, full stop.",Eragon
1445,trevorfiscus,Butchered It!!,1,8 October 2012,"Honestly if I could give this a 0* I would. This movie was horrible. The plot doesn't follow that of the book at all. I mean come on they killed off one of the most fearsome creatures of the first 3 books!! Just killed them.. Bam. Even after Brom warned Eragon that he wouldn't be able to. I could go on and on about how they left parts out, but the worst part for me was how they added stuff in that meant nothing to the book. Like the dispute between Brom and the soldiers in the beginning??? Where did that come from? Murtagh didn't get enough screen time and neither did half the other characters. And some of the most important characters didn't even get recognized. Like where the heck is Orik at for god sakes. He was one of the funniest people in the books and they messed that up. The actors did a good job with the crappy hand they were given. ((EXTREME SPOILER, only readers of the second book will get!!!)) I think they should have spent more time casting two people who somewhat resemble each other as Murtagh & Eragon since they are brothers. I mean brothers can't look that different can they??",Eragon

The main characters aside from Galbatorix, Murtagh, and Angela were well casted, but the plot was jerky and made little sense. This comment was from my roommate who has not yet read the books. I wish that script writers would realize that accuracy to a book's plot is extremely important, did they learn nothing from the success of ""The Chronicles of Narnia?"" The only reason I gave it a 5 was due to the majority of the casting and well as the locations. I really wish I had gone to Casino Royale.",Eragon

It basically slaughters the magic that Christopher Paolini created in the Inheritance trilogy and turns it into a shallow film that will taint your imagination. Many crucial details are left out, leaving a lackluster storyline that does not do anyone justice.I do not know how or why this beautiful novel was translated with such lack of respect for the original content. It could have been an extraordinary film if the director had stuck to the plot. Too many important plot lines were changed- way more than necessary to turn a somewhat lengthy book into an hour and a half film.

With a $100M budget and some big names, not to mention the Lord of the Rings/Harry Potter/Star Wars fever that was going on at the time, this should have been an easy home run. It should have been beyond easy to start a new series of films based on wonderful fantasy novels. Instead, I can only imagine that the studio duped Christopher Paolini into signing over creative control, as this is an atrocity at best. Character are completely changed, plot lines ignored and butchered and the story is only loosely-threaded version of the book. I understand having to compress a book into a movie time frame, but there is truly no excuse for what happened to such an amazing story. Sadly, the saving grace for the Inheritance Cylce of books was that this filmed grossed less domestically than it cost to make, killing the chances of making a farce of the other books. Thank god, as the world didn't need more of this.If you want an incredible experience, read the books. Or better yet, listen to the unabridged audiobooks, read by Gerard Doyle.

I've never read the books on which this movie was based, but you'd think the author could come up with something more than the same formulaic old plot.

The story advanced way too quickly... not fast paced or anything, just sorta like you were thrown from one part to the next without any transitions. Like they took out characters and whole scenes, and didn't fill the gaps with anything to smooth the story over. Maybe I would not have noticed, if I hadn't read the book? Who knows...

All there characters were based off (or looked exactly like) Star Wars characters. At one point the evil sorcerer kills one of his commanders for failing and then tells the guy behind him that he has been promoted. I think someone will be getting a nasty letter from George. The dialog was awful and the movie just ends. I would sum up this movie as a really unfunny and bad spoof movie. It has no direction and writing below a ""B"" movie.

Well, if they did it's a serious case of incompetence.There are characters missing, the relations between the characters are not well explained and the connection between some scenes are just terrible. They appear to ""jump"" from a moment in the movie to another, without any logical order. Katrina was missing, and so were the twins, Solembum and the baby Eragon blesses, all important characters to the second book, if I'm not mistaken. The relation between Eragon and Saphira is a mess, Murtagh seems to talk to Eragon 2 times before they become ""the best of friends"" and Arya was supposed to be more distant: she's almost screaming ""kiss me"". The animated dragon has more facial expression than Edward Speleers, who transmits to the public the emotion of a popcorn. I hated Joss Stone as Angela. Characters like Murtagh, Galbatorix and others fall from the sky without warning. Besides, the actors don't seem to have enough time to ""enter"" the movie. But the worst (or the best): it all ends quickly. It's all easy; to save Arya is easy, to kill the Razac is way too easy and to find the Varden seems to be the easiest thing on earth.

I may sound harsh with that, truly I don't think the movie was terrible, but compared to the potential from the book with the same name, it was devastating.

I remember thinking on multiple occasions while reading them how much potential the story had for great movies--Lord of the Rings-esque movies, even. And then I saw this. They completely changed and cut out huge chunks of the plot for some unfathomable reason. I actually spent most of the movie trying to ignore all the plot changes because they were infuriating me so much. The special effects aren't that fantastic (Saphira--the dragon--has feathers...what?!) and I don't think they added much to the movie. The acting is pretty poor, too (I didn't like the casting at all), but I think that mostly comes down to the script, which was SO cliché and overly theatrical. It's like they took this great, complex fantasy story and cut out everything that made it interesting and intricate, leaving you with this sad, predictable storyline more suited for a children's chapter book. Honestly, I thought the only good thing about the movie was Rachel Weisz voicing Saphira. After reading the books, I was so excited for some epic trilogy of movies that would sweep me off my feet. Looks like I'll have to wait a couple years, until someone gets the idea to remake this movie for real by getting a good screenwriter, casting some good actors, and staying with the original plot.

The acting is horrible and it seems like they writers simply read a synopsis of the book online rather than read the actual book. The movie itself is VERY short and feels rushed.

Best of all, Rachel Weisz and the CGI team did an amazing job creating Safira the dragon.The one thing I found a bit disappointing was the length of the film - I could have watched another hour at least. It felt as if they rushed to the battle scene - I would have liked more build up for this.

1467,zippysquir,Shy so Short?,6,28 December 2006,"This movie had the potential to be a great, but something went wrong. I have not read the books, but as Peter Jackson showed us with Lord of the Rings, one does not need to read a book to enjoy its movie. The cast here is excellent. John Malcovich plays his role so well that he needs to just be on the screen way more. As for the others, well, they're good, but I don;t feel like delving into my assessment of each character. The problem is this: no one is on the screen long enough to get to know them. Since when is a fantasy adventure an hour and a half long? I've heard of films being cut short by budgetary concerns, but this is ridiculous. The film is great, nice and enjoyable, but you have to go in knowing that it will not be the epic of Lord of the Rings or Harry Potter. Fans of the book will be disappointed, but when has that ever not been the case?",Eragon
1468,ravenicus451,Quality Depends On Whether You Read The Book,6,15 December 2006,"My review comes in two parts: How I feel having read the book, and an objective, movie-only view.Having read the book and LOVED it, I was greatly distressed. I could understand how small things were changed, such as how certain things came about, or portions of the journey irrelevant to the plot being cut out. But what I cannot understand are unnecessary changes that completely ruin the story. Events occur in this movie that didn't happen until the second book, Eldest, ruining the possibility for a good sequel. Few characters have any degree of character development, and some characters seem to be jerks that appear out of nowhere and likewise disappear. I've been waiting for this movie since I first saw a poster, and I was greatly disappointed.From an objective point of view, the movie isn't BAD, exactly. If you like fantasy movies, its pretty good. The world is detailed, though not too much can be said in an hour and a half. Fight scenes are interesting, for those of you who crave action. Eragon, along with a couple other characters, show great deals of characterization, and are fairly deep. Others, however, have no real tangibility. They're just kind of... there. It's not the greatest movie in the world.",Eragon
1469,gsgurl2001,Eragon- the hour and a half teaser trailer,3,16 December 2006,"This movie was nowhere near what it was supposed to be. I read the book because I was so excited about the movie, and I must have said countless ""what the hecks"" in during this film. No one established a relationship with anyone else, Eragon seemed to have all of a sudden gotten all the knowledge of all the ancient words without any practice, Murtagh was barely there, details were changed, people were left out, important things were left out, etc. By the time the big secrets of the book were revealed, no one was gasping because there was no build up to them. And no, Eragon was not 17!!! Why on earth would you even bother to change something like that? what was that point? I did not think that Rider and Dragon formed the ""I love you"" relationship they had in the book, and Saphira flew into the sky as a baby and she comes back literally in time 5 seconds later as an adult????? And aren't Eragon's legs supposed to be cut when he rides her? I did not feel bad when Garrow died becuz I never saw him. And Roran's reason for leaving? Totally different. The best thing was the special effects. This movie had such potential. The director and writers were given an amazing chance to do an amazing film and blew it. It looked as if they went and read cliffs notes, then made the film. They were given such good actors too!!! Overall, I was very disappointed that this movie was not nearly as good as the book. My friends who had not read the book even agreed it was too fast and felt things were missing. I know that some books are too long to have everything, but Harry Potter is longer and they sure manage to get their plots in the movies. It will be hard to make Eldest without trying to make Eragon again. But I do look forward to the deleted scenes lol or the movie I should say. Definitely should see a great director's cut. This looked like a teaser. I walked out saying ""well i sure cant wait to see Eragon."" Love the book sooo much, but maybe Chris should write the next script.",Eragon
1470,rahul-raj96,Bad!,2,17 July 2013,"The movie absolutely does NO justice to the book whatsoever. The acting was horrible, many of the important instances in the plot and many crucial characters have been neglected. I feel that Elijah Wood might have made a better Eragon than Ed Speelers . Very poor casting; most of the actors seemed as if this was their first performance. The makeup of the characters didn't match the image that Cristopher Paolini created through his book. ' Personally, i felt it was torture to sit through the 100 minutes and watch it. One star for the visual effects and one star for Rachel Weisz's excellent rendering of Saphira's voice.",Eragon
1471,kurt_crockford,book much better,4,25 January 2007,"well unfortunately I first watched the film then read the book! well before reading the book I found the storyline great, characters seemed to fit their roles well (apart from Eragon) who unfortunately I saw him to be a bit of a babyish figure for the role.. seeing that he was a farm boy and lived a hard life! also Ayra (the elf) well you would have to take a wild guess to believe that she is an elf Film is also very short! scenery is great. I loved the back drops... Also the battle at the end isn't true the book, which is very disappointing.. as the final battle in part 1 gives a very important bareing to the rest of the story!!...after reading the book I think the movie is very untrue and leaves much important details out of the film. hope the second part is as good as the book!",Eragon
1472,thedreamerslair,Excellent Start to a Fantastic Series,3,13 December 2006,"This movie, based on Christopher Paolini's book, has received a bad rap from many critics and fans alike. However, I found it to be an excellent example of fantasy filming with excellent acting and amazing special effects.Although the story is fairly well explained, viewers would be in a better position if they had read the books beforehand. Fans of the novel may find that not enough of the book was included, and that the two hours was not long enough! However, it maintains a fine balance between remaining too true to the book, and seeking its own originality.The acting, including many unknowns like the main, was surprisingly good. Jeremy Irons, veteran actor, was easily the greatest, but Ed Speleers was impressive and believable as Eragon, an amazing feat for a first-time screen actor. Rachel Weisz as Saphira the dragon worked surprisingly well, and John Malkovich's portrayal of Galbatorix was perfectly acted. I personally believe that reports of bad acting are exaggerated, as much of the book is actually written in such a way.The world of Alagaesia is beautifully portrayed with sweeping views of the land, and the sets are each suitably fantastic and add to make the film have the magical feel created in such films as ""Chronicles of Narnia"" and ""Lord of the Rings"". The battle scenes are incredible and amazingly explosive.And finally, Saphira... easily what makes this film a personal 10, the CG dragon is well created, even well acted, and even has an ""awww"" factor! Saphira, voiced by Rachel Weisz, adds plenty of humour to the film, and has an ethereal charm to her character which was perfectly portrayed from the book.I definitely recommend it, but suggest reading the book first and having an open mind before entering the cinema doors.",Eragon
1473,Teknosugar,I nearly walked out!,1,15 December 2006,"I saw an employee preview of Eragon last night, and was really excited because I have waited months to see this. But alas my hopes were dashed with this laughable movie. I was so disgusted I nearly walked out. Yes people it was that bad. If you've read the book, don't see this movie, Its only reedeeming feature was the CG on Saphira. The plot was so different from the book, only certain minute facts were actually drawn upon. The screen play was so childish I had to laugh! The most ridiculous part for all you book fans was Angela (Solembum was completely missed out!) Angela was played by what looked like a 16 year old blonde girl with a nose piercing!!!!!!!! Shame. There were also NO Dwarfs present. The Varden was shamefully lacking, and Eragon and Brom killed the Razac..... Good luck with making the 2nd and 3rd books! No katrina either.. so if Roran is even present in the next movie (if they even make it!) its going to be fun writing his part in. My conclusion if you haven't read the book.. go enjoy a mediocre fantasy movie. If you have you will probably be really disappointed.",Eragon
1474,howzend,Star Wars Meets LOTR,1,12 December 2006,"I remember seeing the book's author on David Letterman a few years ago -- a 15-year-old kid whose first novel is a best seller. I was looking forward to seeing the film. But what a disappointment! It's nothing but Star Wars in the Time of Dragons. Eragon is Luke Skywalker, Durza is Darth Vader, Saphira is Yoda, King Galbatorix is Supreme Chancellor Palpatine, Brom is Obi-wan Kenobi and the Razacs are Orcs. I'm assuming the book is better. If they make a second installment to this film (and I pray they don't), I fully suspect we will find out that Arya is Eragon's twin sister and Durza is Eragon's father. (Both are possible.) Cardboard acting, poor direction, cheesy special effects and costume design from Shanghai Tang. Without a doubt, one of the worst films I've seen in 2006.",Eragon
1475,louiselindboeghansen,A movie with few strengths and lots of weaknesses,7,24 February 2015,"If you compare this movie to Christopher Paolini's books, you will most likely be thoroughly disappointed, because it is nothing like the books. The storyline has been changed completely, and a lot of important characters in the book have been left out.Another thing this movie suffers from is a rushed storyline, as well as some pretty weak writing and directing.The cast is brilliant and so are the special effects, but this, unfortunately, is not enough to completely make up for the bad script and weak dialogue, even if the actors are doing their very best with what is offered.In spite of it's many weaknesses - and doing my best to separate the movie from the book - I still rather enjoyed Eragon, though. And to be fair I don't think the movie is as bad as some have made it out to be. It has some nice action scenes with great visual effects, and I don't mind the LOTR and Star Wars ""rip offs"".All together I think this movie is worth 7 out of 10 if you separate it from the books and enjoy it for what it is.",Eragon
1476,Kestrel_Daystar,Dire,2,18 December 2006,"Never again shall I doubt the word of the critics (well, not as much as I did anyway). Eragon turned out to be exactly what it was made out to be; a rushed, poorly executed 'Lord of the Rings' rip with awfully written lines and linear characters that make no attempt to draw the audience into connecting with them. What's unfortunate is that this movie had so much potential.For anyone who has read the book, you will feel as though you are watching a completely different story with simply the same names thrown in. It seemed like the entire film only lasted half an hour because it was so rushed, and the scenes looked as though they had been given the 'Edward Scissorhands' treatment. It felt like the film had been given a botched glue job in order to string it together and that no thought had been put into the editing. What makes the editing look like a masterpiece, however, is the script, that would have felt more at home on an episode of 'Power Rangers'. It all seemed very contrived, with many predictable instances and events that bored me as I wasted nearly 2 hours of my day. Although it may be difficult to add innovation to a genre that relies on its generic conventions and is governed by Propp's theory of narrative, what is not difficult is following a storyline from a well written and immersive book, which the writers of the film failed to do. If I were Paolini, I would be seething.There were a few redeeming features to this disaster, however. The film boasts a fairly impressive cast (Malkovich (Galbatorix), Carlyle (Durza), Irons (Brom) and Weisz (Saphira)) who do all they can to add life to a dying script. I felt that the portrayal of Durza (Carlyle) was well executed, and made the character actually quite unnerving. Unfortunately Armstrong (Uncle Garrow) and Lewis (Hrothgar) weren't given enough screen time to show off their skills. The big let down in the cast was Speleers (Eragon), who looked like a 20 something playing a supposed 15 year old. His performance was monotonal and emotionless, and looked like he was only in the cast for his physical appeal. Furthermore, I did feel that Joss Stone fit the part of a withered old hag well >:D Secondly the graphics were admittedly impressive, and Director Fangmeier showed his background in visual effects. The CGI was by no means groundbreaking, but nice to look at all the same. Saphira was by far one of the best dragon models brought to the screen, but her composition was unusual to say the least. Why a dragon has feathers is beyond me. She didn't look half a fearsome as she was supposed to. Personally, I found the Urgals amusing. They looked more like biker-boys than fearsome fighting beasts. The final battle scene was too short-lived, and did not provide the audience with any meat to sink their teeth into. The character depth meant that no one would care if any of them died, and I found myself routing for the Shade in the end. Lastly, I thought that Patrick Doyle did a fine job with the original score. I am always a fan of good fantasy film music, and whilst it was by no mean Shore, Williams or Zimmer standard, it was appealing and well composed none the less.I was willing the film throughout to change its style and salvage what they could of the original novel, but alas it wasn't to be. I was incredibly disappointed with what could have been timeless. Truth be told, I enjoyed 'Dungeons & Dragons' more than this, and we all know how dire that was.I advise you to wait for the DVD, and even then borrow it from a friend who buys it. Don't waste your own money.",Eragon
1477,W01fDem0n,I give this movie the worst movie award...,1,17 December 2006,"Actually... this movie doesn't deserve even that award. By now, I already understood going into that movie that most books made into movies aren't true to the book, but the whole, Saphira grows to full adult in ten seconds thing just *censor*ed me off. Baby Saphira was about one of the best things in that movie. Otherwise, so much was missing and or wrong with this movie.1. Why the hell did Murtag actually want to go the Varden? 2. Where was Solembom? 3. Where the hell were the elves? 4. Same for the dwarfs? 5. Since when could you cross a country in what seems to be two days in that movie? 6. I am going to stop asking questions and let you guys start...Christopher Paolini got screwed over with this movie. The only thing that works well for this in the box office is the false advertising. They took a young adult audience book and turned it into a feel good kid movie. I mean, 90% of the battles were removed. Overall, before they can go anywhere near the eldest, they really need to redo the first even if it is impossible.",Eragon
1478,spicychika_92,I thought it was good,9,26 December 2006,"I thought this movie was very good. The beginning started off slow, and it was obvious it was written from the mind of a 15-18 yrs old boys mind. But the more the story progressed the better it got. I thought the actors did a good job. The only actor who I thought needed to be changed was John Malkovich who played King Galbatorix. His tone was always the same in each scene. I don't think he did a very good job. All together the movie was very good. It was very well made, the actors were brilliant, and portrayed each character wonderfully. If you have the time, you want a sci-fi movie then i definitely recommend this movie. I only gave it an 9 because it was very short. I cried once in this movie, but i won't tell you why cause i don't want to spoil it for you. The critics may dislike this movie, but then again they hate all the movies that i enjoy and hold dear to my heart.",Eragon
1479,musicb4us,An Objective Review,10,15 December 2006,"Having just seen Eragon the film, and not having read the book, I can honestly say that as a film it does quite well on its own. Despite what changes were made to the story (as relayed to me via my younger brother, who has read the book), the film really holds your attention.I will say that at times the film was a bit splotchy (meaning that it moved from one place to another very quickly), but other than that I would say that it is definitely a good watch.The actors were superb, and worked well even when the dialogue wasn't perhaps as good as it could've been. As for the dragon, Rachael Weisz did a phenomenal job at making her character seem real. Props must also go out to ILM, obviously, for their great visual work on the dragon.The only thing that bothered me (as a musician) was the score. Patrick Doyle did well throughout most of the film, but there were moments that really reminded me of his other recent films (HP4, Nanny McPhee).Overall, it was no LOTR or Harry Potter, but Eragon is definitely a film that I would recommend watching. That being said, if you've read the book, just be open-minded and realize that some changes are studio-imposed, while others seem to make more sense than what (I'm told) happened in the book.",Eragon
1480,christiandbn,A Mythology but not exactly fantasy,7,17 December 2006,"Eragon captures a good story that is well done for a mythology, but the fantasy aspect of the film may not cater for all level of maturity. The film has a good equilibrium between brutal scenes and soft cute ones and makes this a true family movie. A bit disappointing on the battle scene as it's not full and relatively short (being the main and only battle throughout the film).Jeremy Irons truly brings Eragon to a higher level. Being a now abandoned brave warrior, he helps Eragon with bits and pieces of information about dragons and how to become a great Dragon Rider. I would have expected some more details and experiences from a self selected carer, after the guardian of Eragon (his uncle) gets killed by mercenaries sent from the evil king's right hand, Durza.Siena Guilleroy's moments are not much, but the she is the warrior Aria that all credit must be given, so that the Time of the Dragons may return. The moments interpreted by Aria, most of the time being the damsel in distress, are well played and some of the fighting skills may have glimpses of her previous Resident Evil: Apocalypse.I'm not much fond of Dragons and mythology beasts, but this movie makes like these magnificent creatures, as you progress through the life of Saphira (voiced over by Rachel Weisz) from a small just-hatched creature to a massive fire breathing dragon. The CGI on the Dragon is flawlessly produced throughout the movie and although they may have overdone it a bit with excessive stunts and barrel rolls, it's still a spectacular and relatively new creativity.",Eragon
1481,richard-carpenter95,worst book to film interpretation.,1,19 September 2013,"This film is one of the worst book to film interpretations I have ever seen. The book series is my top favourite series so when I heard about the film I wanted to see it with out a doubt, worst decision. From watching this movie I strongly believe the director never read or even knew what this book was about. The characters are not portrayed anything like in the book the only character I feel that has been portrayed well was the shade, Durza. The acting is wooden and the speech sounds like the actors have no clue what they are saying, just repeating. The CGI of the dragons looks good until you learn what the dragons are supposed to look like then you realise it is dreadful. The events have been changed dramatically from the book so as to make it rubbish and event have been added that where never written into the book. Also if the other books were made into films they would have to cut out key events so as not to contradict things said in this film. It is an okay film if you have never read the books, if you have I highly recommend not watching it so as not to waste your time.",Eragon

After watch this film, I fall in love with it. If I am not mistaken, this film is trilogy. However, until now (21 Sept 2013) there is no any progress. What made me like this film because the storyline is so unique. A village boy decreed to meet with the princess and help her to against the evil. Besides that, he also have been selected to be the dragon rider. The selection has made by the dragon with its own. The way of the dragon to communicate with its rider is also unique. It just the telepathic. On another hand, the dragon riders also become more rare since the dragon is extincting. The most unexpected is the evil king is also a dragon riders.",Eragon
1483,shen3471,Eragon,9,15 December 2006,"As a fantasy writer, I read many books and watch several movies to stay inspired. I will tell you outright, the book was far better than the movie. However, we need to keep in mind that no movie will ever be truly as good as the book it was based on. Perhaps, were the movie directed by the writer, as in the case of Star Wars, it might come close. On the other hand, it is easier to write a book than to make a movie. Hobgoblerinsky looks good in print (no, brilliant! I thought of it just off the top of my head; I think I'll use it in a fantasy later and sell millions of copies!)but try filming a hobgoblerinsky in action and setting it to music! Did Chris write the score? Hell! Did Chris draw the dragon on the cover of his book, the one that became Sapphira in the movie? And furthermore, not to discredit any artist, but to take a picture and turn it into a model simply based on the face and follow every millimeter of that model to a tee to bring it to a computer screen, to put enough points in it to make it movable, and what's more, life-like, to set the colors of shadows just right to make her soar over the earth. That takes a genius far beyond that of simple words on a page. * If visuals impress you, you will like this movie. * If you thought the book did lag in parts, no offense Chris, you'll like this movie. * If you don't mind seeing a story the likes of which took years to create (including those spent by Chris's own predecessors and likely inspirations: J.R.R. Tolkien, Anne McCaffrey and others), being condensed into a mind-blowing 101 minute film, go see this movie. If nothing else, you'll get to see a sweet preview of the upcoming Ninja Turtles CGI flick! Go Turtles!I hope this helps.Sincerely,Iffix Y Santaph",Eragon
1484,mrs-kittywake-bagley,Back to good old fashioned Basics,7,10 November 2014,"I have only just watched this film and was a bit dubious as i was thinking it was going to have too much content crammed into it like Lord of the Rings, which i just couldn't get to grips with. Too many names, places etc to remember for me. Eragon was plain, simple and true good versus evil family fun. You know who is who, who is on what side. The creation of the dragon is great. You get the 'awwwwww' factor when it hatches, and the 'Wow' factor when you see the adult dragon. I think they could have spent more time in the bonding of dragon and main character, it could have been funny to watch i think. I got the feeling that this was more like a 'how to train your dragon' film than a star wars parody as some people have accused it of being. If you are after a simple easy on the eye, easy to understand good old fashioned fantasy that young and old alike can enjoy, i recommend giving this film its dues. If another film isn't made, yes it does end badly because it needs a sequel. but its still a watchable film.",Eragon

A shame that such a phenomenal (though admittedly rather derivative) book is represented by this farce. I will never understand why people were wasting time protesting the release of The Da Vinci Code (which, contrary to popular belief, is a good movie) when their time would have been much better spent boycotting this colossal crap fest.

But if you or your children have read the books or care at all for literary integrity then this is not the film for you. They drastically cut corners and over simplified the plot to the point that I almost didn't recognize the storyline. They took the master work of a great young author and turned it into story time on Sesame Street. It is the equivalent of making Harry Potter without going to Hogwarts.

The special effects are fine but the story is rather hammy and the performances are not very good. The main character looks like a deer in head lights most of the time and the villains acts like cartoon stereotypes more than real characters. Most of the characters here seem like rejects from other films and it shows by how unoriginal they were. The only performance in the film that has any credibility what so ever is the dragon Saphira and that's mainly because she is voiced by Oscar winning actress Rachel Weisz, who has more talent in her vocal cords than all the actors working in this film combined.My suggestion, wait for DVD.",Eragon

1489,p_o_dPennyFan,Character development or lack there of,6,16 December 2006,First off i would like to say i loved the book thought the movie was decent. The thing that i really didn't like was that the movie was really short; it was like 2 hours. So there was no character development and they left out some characters like Angela's cat and Roran's girl friend. Murtagh was probably in the movie a whole 15 minutes. The whole point of the book was to kill the Ra'zac they kill the razac off in like one hour. i just think they were dumb to make it short b/c they left out a lot of good stuff.I saw a movie with a friend who didn't know anyhting about eragon. I was explaining things to him during the movie. At one point eragon lets spahirra go fly. You see her in the sky and she all the sudden gets huge. My friend was like what happened and i said that was over a period of months or weeks that that happened. Boy was i wrong. Evidently the creators of this movie think its a waste of time to actually let Saphirra grow so she grew from a baby to her normal size in about a minute.I think the movie is worth seeing. It is probably better for someone who hasn't read the book then someone who has read the books. Because they changed the book so much that it kind of bothered me. But anyways everyone should see it.,Eragon
1490,Skelton_The_Wanderer,A fine way to pass an afternoon.,8,16 December 2006,"I went to see Eragon earlier today. Eragon is no masterpiece. Compared with other fantasy films such as Lord of the Rings, it's a kid doodling in sand. Compared to films such as the Dungeons and Dragons film, it's a magnificent achievement. It seemed a little rushed in many places.The acting highlights are most definitely Jeremy Irons as Brom, and Rachel Weisz as the voice of Saphira. Eragon himself is not really anything to shout about, and poor Murtagh doesn't feature very prominently at all.As if anyone goes to see films like Eragon for the wonderful acting. The people who go to see this film for anything other than to bash it mercilessly will most likely be going for one thing: Saphira.And if that's the case, as it was with me, you will not be disappointed. Saphira is very easily the second-best thing about Eragon. She is cute as a hatching and spectacular as an adult. She is well-voiced by Rachel Weisz, who gives sympathy and emotion to the role. Saphira being the second-best thing, the best thing in Eragon is the scenery. Even if dragons and battles bore you, just watch the scenery. It's great.Final Verdict: Eragon is a flawed film. In places it is rushed. However, if you leave your inner film critic at the door, it is an enjoyable film and, as I said in the title, a fine way to pass an afternoon.",Eragon

1493,crazyjoefound,This move is really terrible.,1,18 December 2006,I have read Eragon and Eldest and am patiently waiting for the third installment of the series. This movie is the biggest letdown of the year. Although there are certain elements of the story that is similar to The Lord of the Rings series that does not mean that this movie should suffer for the successes of that whole franchise. Major elements of the story was left out and the story in the book is a lot harder and darker than what was in the movie. The director is an absolute disappointment to the movie as this is his first film. Erya is supposed to be an elf and there were supposed to be dwarfs and the urgals were not fat bald guys. eragon was supposed to be trained over many months by the warriors of the varden and the twins which were left out of the movie. THIS MOVIE TOTALLY BLOWS! DO NOT SEE THIS MOVIE!,Eragon
1494,hirrihirri,"Worst ""page-to-screen""-movie ever!",1,2 January 2014,"This review serves the purpose of making others aware of the awful low quality of this ""page-to-screen""-movie.This movie is downright an insult to Christopher Paolini's quadralogy: Inheritance, comprising ""Eragon"". I made this account today, so that I would be able to write a review here (on IMDb.com). I hope that someone with proper ambitions, a backbone and diligence with the means to recreate this movie reads this review. Made with a dedicated instructor, director and crew this movie could be a breakthrough for the fantasy-genre... Come on, guys. A story like ""Eragon"" must be given the respect it deserves. We need to make the right people aware of this. The movie does NOT resemble the book - at all! This is horrible! Oh, such a shame... I am truly astonished by this piece of ""movie"".",Eragon
1495,swimgirl_09,The Best,10,2 April 2007,I have read many or your guys comments and to some people the moviewas bad. Now remember some people have different perspectives on fantasy and books and everything like that. I honestly think that the performances were really good. The relationship between Eragon and Brom and the dragon where fantastic. We all have our differences but i really thought the movie was good. It was something different than lord of the Rings and Harrypotter. I mean this time it was about a dragon. I always wanted to be a part of a movie so magical this was great. I have to say i am still in my teen years and i might be to old to like this movie or i might be to young to understand why some people do not like this movie. I have to say i like this movie its the best i have ever saw. I am right now reading the Eldest book number 2 and i hated the ending on Eragon it makes it seems like there will be another movie. So if anyone knows that there is going to be another movie than email me at swimgirl_09@msn.com. Thank so much.,Eragon
1496,mary190,I hate this movie!,1,30 November 2008,"I have only a question for you: DID you read the book before writing the screenplay??? I hope not, because that would mean you can't read at all! I have never seen in all my life a movie so...dunno...so hateful for somebody who have been enjoyed the book. I stared at the screen, disgusted, for all the duration of the movie while I was thinking': ""what is that? What the hell is that? You killed the book, murderers!"". I'm wondering why Chrisopher Paolini allowed the producers to make this movie. The characters, the places, the story, aren't as interesting, strange, mysterious and fascinating as in the book.Oh my God! I'm trying to remove from my mind what i've seen but it MARKED me...I won't ever be the same...",Eragon

1498,Codfeind900,Included barely any of the main events from the books.(do not read if you want to watch the movie or read the books for yourself),3,9 January 2014,Almost all of the main events from the book are gone and this is nothing like the book. I am going to list as many inaccuracies as i can so don't read if you want to watch for yourself. 1.When Saphira first flies she grows as much as she does throughout the whole series in 1min. 2. The farm that Eragon lived in is burned down by the Razac not Brom. 3. Eragon and Brom go many places before Brom dies. Such as Tierm Yazuac and Dras Leona. 4. Brom is not killed by Durza but by he Razac and it wasn't in Gilead it was in a wilderness area. 5. Brom was dead before Gilead and Murtagh had already joined Eragon. 6. Arya was unconscious the whole ride to the Varden and was near death. 7. Brom and Eragon spent much time training in the books and although the movie would be too long to include all of the training they could have at least taken a minute to show a few seconds of sparring and other stuff. 8. The Razac aren't killed until the third book long after the events of this movie. 9. Doesn't even mention Roran after the first five minutes. 10.the twins in the books ( the ones that kidnap Murtagh after the battle of Farthen Dur) are never mentioned in the entire movie. I think that is most of them but there are s more things wrong... My biggest disappointment is that there aren't movies for the rest of the series and leaves the plot unresolved. The end makes me expect a sequel but i cant find any which is probably for the best. Fox should entirely remake this movie with the guidance of the author himself maybe then they wont screw it up.,Eragon
1499,Diogonunes,Poor use of a great story...,6,27 December 2006,"Well, as I walked out of the theater, I couldn't help feeling disappointment since I read the book and found it really good. The better part, and the only good one, were the shots of the dragon itself, since shots like that are still rare in movies these days.. but still the dialogs between the hero and the dragon were disastrous. Wardrobe was not bad to the eye, but with very few realism (looks like peasants and farmers wash their shirts every day!!). And finally, the performance of all the actors in general was very low, even great ones as Jeremy Irons and John Malkovich but specially of Edward Speleers.. Also, I found the movie too short for a complex story as this one is. There is no logical succession between acts and no path for unknowers of the book to follow... It looks like it was made in a hurry! To end, a request for the future: don't waste great stories, and the obvious opportunity to make a huge success, on such films...it's really sad, if not embarrassing...",Eragon
1500,barbatbaymills,An insult to the book.,4,18 December 2006,"They changed just way, way too many things. I understand omitting things due to time constraints. But having the wrong characters at the wrong places when certain events happen! And Arya....I won't wreck it for anyone who hasn't seen it...but they completely rewrote her role in the movie!!! For anyone who read the book, this movie is an insult. While I was watching the movie, I was thinking to myself that they should have skipped the movie and made a mini-series instead and done the story right.The baby dragon and the special effects are the saving grace of the movie.",Eragon
1501,armandmusat,Totally messed up,2,16 December 2006,"Paolini's book, although not entirely original, was at least entertaining. The film was at least awful.First of all, many scenes from the book were cut in the film, without a reason, as the film could have lasted two and a half hours, even three, without problems, as the LOTR films lasted. Why did the director cut it to such a short time for a long story is anybody's guess. Because of its short time, the characters and the relationships between them could not evolve as well as they did in the books. The time Eragon spent learning swordplay and magic with Brom was cut to a short sparring and the learning of three magic formulas, ""brisingr"" for fire and ""skulblaka ven"" for dragon vision and another formula I can't remember for healing, and then Brom died, without having such a spectacular death as he should have had. Compared with Gandalf's evolution as a mentor and death in LOTR, it's lame. Second of all, the characters where all wrong. Totally wrong. Eragon had to be a brave, a little foolhardy but overall scared young boy training to be a hero, but in the film we see a stupid boy thinking that he could defeat everything that moves. Brom had to be killed by the Ra'zac, not by Durza, and Gil'ead was a city, not just an empty citadel inhabited by Durza and the Ra'zac. And most annoying, Murtagh isn't anything that he was supposed to be in the book. In the book we see a mysterious, silent traveler, hiding a dark past, that DID NOT want to go the Vardens, but in the film we see a smiley boy practically begging Eragon to let him show him the way to the Vardens. Not to mention that the relationship with Eragon and Murtagh is non-existent, and Murtagh had to disappear after the battle of Tronjheim, and reappear in the second book as the Red Dragon Rider, kidnapped by the Twins, that don't even appear in the film. I'm curious, in the unfortunate case if a sequel will be made, how will be this link made between the films. But we see Murtagh after the battle, all smiles and cheers, telling Eragon that his dragon survived. Durza did NOT ride that black thing, the Ra'zac did, and in the book he is not seen riding anything, but for special effects' sake, it's forgivable. Saphira did not choose her name, and if the character development would have been a little better, it would have been shown that Eragon named his dragon Saphira, after Brom told him different dragon names, and it would have been shown later that Brom's dead dragon had the same name. And Angela's werecat from the book doesn't even appear in the film, although it was an important element to the plot. Sad.Thirth of all, all the different races in the film look the same ! We see an elven princess looking exactly like a human, without the elven characteristics pointed in the book, we see Urgals, orc-like creatures looking like club bouncers with tattoos and dwarfs (if there were any, I'm not sure) being just as tall as humans, having only the long beards.Fourth of all, the mountain city of Tronjheim is shown only from the outside, and it would have been a beautiful sight to see, as well as the Sapphire Star that was destroyed when Eragon slew Durza, and most important:WHERE'S THE BATTLE OF TRONJHEIM?The great Battle of Tronjheim from the book consisted in the film only of a faint scream of Arya when she ordered ""Fire"", two or three arrows hitting some club bouncers, ahem, Urgals, and then Eragon and Durza fighting in the air until Eragon kills Durza and the Urgals mysteriously disappear after that. When I saw this, I remembered the epic Jackson battles that made the LOTR films worth watching more than one time, the most spectacular battle scenes I ever saw, and I felt sad for this sad joke of a fantasy movie.Fifth of all, the acting and dialogues were lame. I liked Irons' and Malkovitch's acting, but they are experienced and famous actors, and they even managed to make the stupid dialogues seem interesting. Carlyle's acting was also good, as he portrayed Durza very much like in the book, and he played his character very well.. The rest, including Speeler's main character Eragon, were lame. For the main character of a movie that has been so expected by the Eragon fans, they could have chosen at least a better actor to portray Eragon. I wonder how Paolini let these people release such a piece of crap on the big screens, as they messed up his whole creation.The only truly beautiful thing in this movie is the design of Saphira and the voice acting of Weisz, being the only reason I gave this movie a 2 out of 10 instead of 1",Eragon
1502,Rich-West,Perfect for the 6-14 age group,7,6 December 2008,"While this is no copy of Lord of the Rings, does have that mystical feel to it. I thought it was a fun movie, especially when watching it with the younger ones, even though it did not have the refinement of bigger budget films that targeted a much older audience.I, for one, have not let my kids watch Lord of the Rings, as that series of movies, while wonderful, contains way too much gore and has way too deep of a story line for them. I wasn't looking forward to the sleepless nights filled with nightmares of the Orcs, huge spiders, etc.However, this movie definitely filled the gap. They got the mystical aspect of another world without the overtly deep story and head-lopping-off gore.We rented this one. I would probably have been initially upset (a bit) if I took them to the movies, paying $10 a head, to see this, but to hear them talk about it after seeing it made me realize that either intentionally or unintentionally, this movie hit this target audience.",Eragon
1503,yeroon,"That a movie lacks certain characters and places when compared to a book is natural, but the way it is here, is actually unnatural.",1,8 February 2007,"First of all i'm a HUGE fan of the book and have read it a lot. And when i heard there was going to be a movie i thought: WOW! Now that i have seen the movie i'm thinking: why on earth did i go see this :s. That a movie lacks certain characters and places when compared to a book is natural, but the way it is here, is actually unnatural. Soldiers in Carvahall? The King knowing the boys name and location? Saphira growing in 2 sec? Arya awake? No underground dwarf city? Arya leaving? Eragon not down by the sword to his back? This is by far the worst film adaption of a book ever. If you liked the book and haven't seen the movie, don't go watch it. If they could have just sticked to the book instead of making the Eragon the hero straight away, but i think this is more Hollywood like, sadly.",Eragon
1504,PaulOrozco,The truth about this movie....,9,4 January 2007,"I went to watch this movie with great apprehension. The book cover never interested me, though I acknowledged that it had gained some serious popularity. That said, watching the movie was a pleasant surprise. It's not Lord of the Rings by any stretch of the imagination. Somewhat like ""The Lion, The Witch, and The Wardrobe"" isn't ""Harry Potter"".Having said that, it was still a pleasantly enjoyable movie. It could have used perhaps a stronger actor in the lead, but in the end very little is lost by this. The movie actually inspired me to read the book and having seen some of the posts by fans, I was curious as to just how different the two were. I really do feel pity for the writers, their job was not easy, somehow they had to compact an experience that would have taken 12 hours of film into 2 and change. Some of the omission's and cuts that they made I completely understood. There are others, however that I just don't understand. No elves were present in the movie, though they clearly would have had a prominent role, nor where there dwarfs (which I understand more, considering the monumental effort that Lord of the Rings went though to accomplish the size illusion).Some things were left out, and in the end, I don't feel that they harm the story a great deal. If you haven't read the book, and have a good grasp of the trailer, and still wish to see the movie, I don't believe that you'll be disappointed. If you have read the novel, like nearly any other movie based on a novel, you will no doubt be upset and in some cases even angered by the changes.The cinematography was good, the computer animation (namely the dragon Saphira) was superb. If fantasy (Lord of the Rings, Dragon Heart, etc.) is your thing, then this is a movie for you.",Eragon
1505,thomas-463,I expected more,1,15 December 2006,"I mean, they did an awesome job on the special effects, but the rest of the movie was bad. The dialog was poor, and they just moved to rapidly in this epic battle. Some characters are not introduced properly, and, if you haven't seen the movie, you wouldn't know what the heck was going on.And that is without comparing it to Lord of the Rings and Harry Potter.They spent too much money on animating Saphira - and too little on the actual screenplay and script.And they left out key characters, and just rushed forward... Couldn't wait to get out of the cinema.God it was horrid.I hope they find another director for ""Eldest"".",Eragon

I will give it one thing.... i'm not even kidding, just.... one thing. watching the movie made me read the book, now i know why everyone hates it. i could have done a better job on this script while drunk and on LITERALLY, any other drug you could think of. This movie is the result of reading the back of the book cover and the last two chapters. I seriously hope the moron who wrote this never has children, we already have enough stupid people in the world. If the person who did the script for this (shudders) movie, QUIT YOUR JOB. You seriously suck at this OUT LOUD.",Eragon
1507,meathead0249,Waste of time,1,15 December 2006,I have read the book many times and I have also read the squeal many times over. So when I heard that a movie was going to be made about this great book I went crazy. I have been waiting for this movie for about 2 or 3 months. When I got to see the movie on the opening night I was very excited. Within the first 30-45 minutes of the movie i was able to see that I was not going to like this movie. The major scenes that are changed will make anyone who has read the book dislike the movie. The whole time I was watching the movie I was counting things that were different from the great novel. I hate to say it but I regret to inform you that I lost count. So I hate to say it but PLEASE do NOT go and see this movie.-Panda,Eragon
1508,fullofgaras,Terrible!,1,3 April 2014,"The movie barely followed the plot of the book. Arya had the wrong hair color and her ears weren't pointed like an elf is supposed to be. They skipped a few important things that are big things in the next book. Such as Saphira's blessing. The blessed child plays an important role in the second book. And Saphira grew up at an inconsistent speed, up until she flew into the sky and returned full size (during which there was no time passes caption of any kind). Would never watch again, and I don't want to see the second one. I'll stick to the books.",Eragon
1509,taniagerou,The book was BETTER,5,16 September 2015,"The book was amazing.. Really, these guys could get very rich of they just made a decent film. I have to say, I liked the dragon, but everything else was awful. I didn't even get sad when Brom died! There was no emotional connection between the movie and the audience.. Arya and Eragon were also awful, the script was ridiculous (when I first read 'It's better to ask forgiveness than permission', I really liked it. When I heard it at the movie, I almost laughed.), everything was just wrong! I hated the fact that they didn't explain anything about magic (Christopher Paolini's view of magic was very interesting) and they didn't mention the fact that Eragon hurt his back during his battle with the Shade, which is one of the most important things in the second book. I guess they knew how bad the film was and they had already decided not to make a second one. Last but not least, the Shade was so ridiculous in the final battle, like it was trying to be a clown or something. It wasn't scary (as it should have been), it was just stupid, just like the whole battle. Peter Jackson, please redirect this movie! We will gladly make you a billionaire.",Eragon
1510,sabrinalbc,This movie would be way better if the filmmakers hadn't changed so much from the book,5,18 April 2014,"Me and my sister saw this movie on TV recently. I think we were both surprised by how much they had changed the story. We have both read all four of the books, and l loved them. As a movie on its own, rather than an adaptation of a book, Eragon is alright. I have no problems whatsoever with the acting itself. It seems a bit harsh to say that the dragon is the only good performance in the whole thing, because that's not where the problems are. The problems are with the plot, which moves too fast, and the fact that it doesn't go into enough detail or explain things properly. Other than that it is a fairly reasonable movie. But it isn't just a movie. It's a movie adaptation of the first book in a four part series. So it should follow the story, like Harry potter did. Instead the dwarfs are hardly even there, the information about magic we are given is inadequate, Eragon and Saphira don't show enough affection for each other (dragons and riders are supposed to be so close that they go mad with grief if one of them dies), some characters look nothing like how they are described in the book (Arya is meant to be a dark haired elf with pointed ears not a light haired human, Galbatorix is not meant to be bald, how hard is it to get wigs and hair dye) and the order of events has been jumbled up. Almost nothing looked how I imagined it to be; in fact many things were the opposite. Anyone who says ""oh that's exactly what I imagined it to be like from the book"" obviously has no reading comprehension skills. Angela is not supposed to be in her twenties and covered in spangles, the villages are not supposed to be in the middle of a lake but in the middle of plains, etc. SPOILER ALERT Also, how come they killed the Ra'zac about halfway through the movie? That's not supposed to happen until the 3rd book. I don't see how they could make the other 3 books into movies now that they've changed so much. I even thought the battle at the end was a bit of a let down. It was meant to be 2 armies having this massive fight on a huge plain. Instead a few things get trashed in the bottom of the valley (where does a valley come in??) and mostly everyone just watches Eragon and Saphira fight Durza in the air. SPOILERS OVERIf you haven't read the books then you won't notice all that much wrong with the movie, but if you have, you'll see how much they have changed everything. But I always try to read the book before I watch the film adaptation. Watch the movie if you want, but if you haven't read the book you will probably enjoy the film more. Once me and my sister had realised how much they changed everything, we stopped going ""why isn't this happening"" or ""why is that not happening"". Instead, we just watched like it was pretty much separate from the book and the characters just happened to have the same names.",Eragon
1511,sindrijo,Horrible book to Movie adaptation,1,15 December 2006,"I read the book before going to see this movie, and my expectations were high, perhaps a bit too high. I expected an equally good book to movie script adaptation that Peter Jackson and his lady-friend managed to do.Sitting through this movie was absolutely horrible, if you have read the book, liked it, and then go see this movie, it will, literally suck your will of living right out of your chest.Many reviewers I find are shallow and see nothing but star-wars dropped into a LOTR environment, I can understand that, but come on?... This kind of storytelling is almost classic, but its not only the bad book to movie transformation, well, yes transformation, the inconsistencies, fact errors, and stupid and un-logical changes are countless, and very few of them are understandable. Oh, and the acting is not good, moments that should be filled with drama and should suck you more into the story of the movie actually are all of the following; cheesy, corny and unbearable.The only good things about this movie is the special effects, but oh, wait. They were done by the masters, a.k.a. Industrial Light and Magic and also Weta Digital who did all of the effects for the LOTR trilogy.The screenwriters should hang, so should the director for going trough with it. And oh, I don't know about Christopher Paolini how can you agree to such a bad script? Either his in a mental asylum, after realizing what has been done to his book, or he may just be a greedy bastard capitalist who only thinks about how his books can make him money.Stay away from this movie!",Eragon
1512,rlaufmann,Worst book to film adaptation ever.,3,10 May 2014,"The book Eragon is enjoyable if a bit predictable at times. The film adaptation is poorly written bare-bones version of the original story. I would recommend skipping this film if you have not read the book. I watched it with relatives who had not read the book and they were thoroughly confused, I had to constantly stop and explain things that they had left out of the movie. As a fan of the book it was mildly enjoyable, but it would have been better to served and wait to make this movie. Now, chances are due to this horrible flop the sequels will never get made. I know everyone (myself included) wanted this to be the next Lord of the Rings, an awesome epic fantasy series brought to life. That didn't happen.

1513,flossyft1,Escape From Reality into Fantasy,7,5 February 2007,"Personally i don't see the problem with this film. At times the script does get weak and the acting rather poor. But at the end of the day it gives you an escape into a fantasy world like that you dream of as a child.The whole storyline is a bit predictable at times, like many other films. Its kind of like a cross between lotr's (although it would never meet that standard)and Dragonheart. I think that the actor who played Eragon done well, its the script that needs improving. Overall I give it a thumbs up, although there is many things that could be improved greatly.",Eragon
1514,keflavich,Worst Star Wars clone ever,1,16 December 2006,"From start to finish, this was the worst movie I've ever seen. The narration in the beginning refused to stop, and hinted that things would only get worse. My greatest regret is not walking out of the film.The music is terribly melodramatic and manages to highlight the worst elements of the film. The actors do nothing interesting at all. Half the lines in the movie are there to describe obscure features of the fictional universe. The costumes are shockingly stereotypical: red and black for the evil guys, white and ridiculous gold shiny things for the good guys. And for some reason, the hero wears an ""old fashioned looking"" collared shirt.(spoilers below) The plot is nearly a perfect clone of Star Wars. A young princess is captured by the evil dark lord, but she manages to get the only thing that can save her precious rebellion to exactly the right person - a farm boy who will soon have to leave home. Then he meets a wise old man, a veteran of the old wars, and during their meeting his uncle is killed while he fails to save him. ""If you'd have been there, you'd have been killed too."" Sound familiar?So they lead a daring escape, but must return to the evil lair to rescue the princess, and the wise old man dies to allow his protégé to go free, and gives him his magical sword too. The movie ends with hero slaying villain, but of course there's a deeper villain hiding behind the first. Ooooh!Don't bother yourself seeing the movie: while the plot follows Star Wars as closely as imaginable without a copyright lawsuit, it lacks the key elements that made the movie good.",Eragon

I didn't expect anything mind-blowing, but I was expecting it to be good, seeing as how they had a pretty decent cast. So I got to the theater with my mom... and it started... I'm thinking, ""okay.. pretty good so far."" And then things started to confuse me a little because the story was a bit different than I remembered (which I should have expected). To me, the movie seemed to go by extremely fast, and it seemed really short. They didn't give enough air time to some key roles, which really disappointed me.. there wasn't enough time to get to know the characters like Ajihad, Murtagh, Hrothgar, and Nasuada.

And there was no way they would be able to fit the book into one movie, and they chopped up the story so much that even my friends who have never read the books were confused while we watched it. There were maybe two or three characters in the movie that were even remotely close to what they were like in the book. The story is really amazing and I hope that someday a good director and writer will be able to make this story come alive on film.

1518,thiagosgbr,Over-budgeted B movie,3,18 December 2006,"Oh my goodness, where to start? Well, I should first say that I've read the first book of the Inheritance Trilogy, and am not a big fan. I absolutely adore fantasy literature, but this one seemed to be overloaded with clichés, something like 'What would happen if Star Wars took place in Middle Earth?'. Nonetheless, it made for an entertaining reading. But this review is not on the book but on the movie, so moving on...My point is that all the appealing parts of the book (Saphira's nobility and relationship to Eragon, his learning of magic, the subtleties of politics between Varden, Dwarfs, the king, the Urgals etc.) are not there, not to mention the butchered storyline. The film is a messy sequence of action scenes with cheesy, cheesy dialogue and punch lines - at some point I stopped taking it seriously and was laughing out loud in the theater. Editing is worse than most TV made movies, with endless slow motion close-ups. The acting is terrible, but I can't blame all the excellent actors (and what a line-up: Irons, Weisz, Carlyle, Malkovich!), they had some bad material to work with. And Speleers seems like an unfortunate choice, bland as a young actor can be.In a nutshell, I would recommend avoiding it.

It was evident that the people responsible for putting this together were not invested in the story, but rather splicing together some film to generate some money. The studio saw a book with a wonderful story, written by a very talented young man about a boy coming of age and saw this as an opportunity to peddle special effects with no substance.Yes, the effects were stunning. The dragon Saphira came to life, and the flight scenes were breathtaking, not to mention Rachel Weisz's wonderful job of giving the dragon her voice. But that was not enough to save this movie's weak adaptation of the book. Too much substance was missing I'm not talking scenes, because, inevitably when you take a 500 plus page book and turn it into a movie, scenes will be missing, I'm talking the heart of the book. The meat of the story is Eragon's growth from farm boy to warrior and the audience was cheated out of that. We didn't get to see Eragon bond with any character, not even Saphira, and that is why this movie falls flat for me.So, maybe, like the Lord of the Ring's Trilogy, we will have to wait a decade or two for someone who loves this story, really loves this story as Peter Jackson did Tolkien's Lord of the Rings before someone steps up to the plate and does this story justice when they put it to film.",Eragon
1520,habu16,Comprehensive summary,6,17 December 2006,"Well, first off, I will just rate the movie on it's own, not in comparison to the book. The movie has the basics of an epic movie, something Fox had been marketing it as before it came out. It has excellent scenery, which by the way, looks quite different than the scenery in LOTR. It has stunning special effects, as far as Saphira goes. The other special effects are standard fare. The cast is topnotch, although Ed Speleers needs some work. Then the movie starts to fall apart. The script is horrible, seemingly written by a kindergärtner, although that might be an insult to kids in that grade. The pacing of the movie is very shoddy, as if the director originally filmed it as a much longer movie, then decided to cut it down at the last minute. The beginning scenes in Carvahall take way too much time, causing the middle part of the movie to be very rushed. There is no character development; in fact, the majority of the characters introduced are not even given names in the movie. The characters that are in the movie, for the most part, are very substandard. Arya, for example is pathetic. Her lines were even worse than everyone else's, and her acting also left much to be desired. Brom was good, although he too was hamstrung by the amateurish script. Murtagh was great, but he had a total of what, eight lines? The battle at the end left much to be desired. Many Empire troops are shown coming into the battle, then they disappear, and only a few are shown. Ajihad disappears halfway through the battle, and you hear nothing more of him. These are but a few of the many problems with the movie itself, not in comparison to the book.Now, for the comparison to the book. I believe everyone knows the main details that were changed, so I will not go into much detail with them. The entire middle section of the book is taken out, including Orik, Jeod, and Solembum. At the beginning of the movie, Roran leaves to escape being drafted, and Katrina is not even in at all. This removes his entire motivation for his actions in Eldest, so I do not know how they are going to get around that. The whole thing with Saphira growing up was pointless and removed much of their relationship from the book. I had no qualms with Brom. Murtagh was in for a very brief time, and did not bond with Eragon at all. Again, this is of vital importance to Eldest. Arya acts as a teenager and comes on to Eragon at the end, also changing a major portion of the plot for Eldest. The dwarfs are not in the movie; in fact, Hrothgar is never mentioned by name. The Twins are also not in the movie. Throughout the entire movie, the screenwriter and director took extremely excessive liberties with the book and added stuff in that was much less vital than that which they removed. Overall, I gave the movie 6 out of 10 stars. The visual details were great. Saphira was absolutely stunning. The script, pacing, and some of the acting dragged the movie down, way down. The ending was especially senseless, as it destroys any chance of making Eldest faithful to the book. As a movie on it's own, it is mediocre, but compared to the book it is laughably bad.",Eragon
1521,euphemisms,Average film with average acting,6,14 December 2006,"Whilst some would probably agree this to be a kids movie, the storyline definitely had potential but the acting was fairly mediocre overall. Edward Speelers should probably work on dialog delivery a bit harder next time, it seems as his expressions and body language were not as well as someone would expect the main character to be. There were a few other rough edges that needed to be smoothened and the script could be a lot better. My pick of the actors for this movie would be Robert Carlyle - he had this sinister, evil aura about him which was much expected.My rating for this movie would have to be **1/2*/*****",Eragon
1522,varlenn,without having read the book.....,7,18 December 2006,"I actually found Eragon, as a movie, quite interesting and entertaining, although I confess that I have not read the book for comparison.While there could have been improvements in the areas of the pacing of the movie (as usual - too fast in some places, and too slow in others), and some of the dialogue could have used improvement, the visuals, especially of the viewpoint from dragon-back, and the premises involved in the bonding of human and dragon were definitely worth the price of admission.The casting was good, although I felt that the movie would have been better served with a cast of less known actors and actresses; I personally would have chosen a different actor for the king, and a different voice for the dragon. It was particularly fun seeing Jeremy Irons take up another sword & sorcery- related movie role, given the performance he gave in Dungeons & Dragons, although, to be fair, he does seem to have gotten back his stride and was a solid contribution to the story.If there is a disparaging remark to make about this film, the only comment I would have would be that while watching it I had one too many thoughts comparing the ""heroic journey"" notions found in Star Wars, or Lord of the Rings, to that which occurs in Eragon. There are too many occasions of ""not being ready"" to take on the needs of the plot, as well as the endowment of things - from the being ""chosen"" for the quest to the notion of receiving a special blade - that the writing clearly followed the formula for such tales too closely.I would say that I would be interested in seeing what they do with the sequel (as the hanging ending of Eragon would seem to demand), although I would not necessarily rush to the theatre when it does come out. Unless there are some improvements, I would see the rest of the series based on Eragon expect short theatre runs, or even be released directly to DVD.",Eragon
1523,jnnfrmrk,"Good special effects, bad writing",4,27 October 2014,"This is an action, adventure and family movie. It is the adapted version of the book ""Eragon"" from Christopher Paolini, the lead actor being Ed Speleers as Eragon. This is the story of a young farmer called Eragon who finds a dragon egg that hatches for him. The dragon is called Saphira and as she grows older, they are discovered. He goes on an adventure to find his uncle's killers and take revenge. With the help of Brom a ex-dragon rider, he finds out that the killers are working for the king. As he travels the world and as a dragon rider, he learns magic, fighting. Then he meets elves, dwarfs in order to make alliances as their goal is to kill the king and free the country from the evil dragon rider. The story is a typical of fantasy story with the hero saving the day. In my opinion, this film isn't bad. The special effects are nice, well made. However, It doesn't really follow the plot very well. Many major characters from the original novel are missing. This is a rather poor and unimaginative adaptation of the book. I would strongly recommend to watch the film first if you are interested because you would be extremely disappointed if you were to read the book, first.",Eragon
1524,Jillywinkles,I thought it was good (don't hate me)...,10,20 December 2006,"First of all, may I say that I hated the books, but was looking forward to this movie. I had second thoughts when I saw all the bad reviews, but I still went and saw it. And I have to say that I don't know what the critics were talking about. You would only be disappointed if you were expecting either another LOTR, or a movie that followed the book exactly (Never happened and never will, thank goodness).I give it 8/10. (I voted 10/10 here because I think the average should be more than five. At least 6 or 7.) Pros: Excellent acting by all.Excellent fighting and action sequences, especially the flying one at the end with Durza.Lovely scenery (it's nice to have a change from New Zealand once and awhile).Good music, except in a couple places.Cons: Saphira's voice annoyed the heck out of me. It bugged me that it was so American, but most of all it was too old. I had imagined something younger.The narration in the beginning was a little cheesy, but when you kept in mind that it was a PG movie, it was alright. In general I didn't think the script was that bad.Choppy editing in a couple places. I also get the feeling that they edited a lot out, for instance Katrina wasn't there at all, and I think with a little more character development I would have felt sadder when Garret and Brom died. But on the whole it was a good length, it didn't feel too long or too short.The end bit with Galbatorix was unnecessary and a little cheap.The scene with Angela was good, but kind of out of place. It was that ""Go buy bread"" line. It made no sense.Overall this was an excellent adaptation of the book. I went with 3 other people, and 1 of them hated it but the others liked it. And even the one who hated it agreed with me when I said, (comparing to the harry potter movies): ""Harry Potter are bad movies with good things in it; Eragon is a good movie with bad things in it.""",Eragon
1525,jashar,Far Too Rushed,2,15 December 2006,"The plot was far too rushed. They didn't spend any time developing the characters or explaining anything. Movies are rarely as good as books, but if I hadn't read the book I would have found this movie hard to follow. Durza was by far the best part. He was impressive and imposing. The Urgals were more like retarded barbarians than they should have been. Eragon was a bit wimpy too. The movie never showed how his skill progressed, or how he practiced. This really should have been at least a 2 and a half hour movie not the hour and half they made. I hope someone in the future gives this story another try and see if they can make the movie right this time.",Eragon
1526,seporoth99,Why I thought it was good,8,16 December 2006,I do not get why people go to movies based on books complain that it does not follow the story. You read the book for entertainment. I saw the movie for entertainment. So what if it is not exactly follow the story. YOU READ THE BOOK FOR THAT STORY! If you wanted the same then go read the book genius. These certain people do not allow the fim makers any leniency towards their material. I would be a 6 hour movie with the exact same plot. I go to see movies for entertainment. I read books for entertainment. I love the book just as much as everyone else. I am just as loyal as a fan as everyone else. I was entertained by it never the less. It was a good movie. 8 out of 10.,Eragon

1528,margrettgreat,This film plays more like a bad SNL skit parodying the Lord of The Ring.,1,24 December 2006,"Horrible and very funny adaptation of the popular children's book that plays like a bad SNL skit that is trying to parody ""The Lord of the Rings"" than the book that it's based on. The screenplay is a major mess with dialog that even little kids would find stupid and the performances are almost all laughably bad. Jeremy Irons and John Malkovich should be ashamed of themselves for even agreeing to be in this film and Djimon Hounsou should start reading his scripts a little more carefully. The only redeeming thing about this crappy film is the great voice over work of Rachel Weisz, who manages to give the dragon Saphira more talent and range in terms of solid acting than all the human actors working in the film. The C.G.I work done for Saphira was also well done, making her more lifelike than her human co-stars as well. Outside of Rachel Weisz's great voice acting and the great special effects for the Dragon Saphira, this movie is more and less a bad comedy that did not deserve nether of them.",Eragon
1529,todyto,Do not compare with the book...,5,16 December 2006,"I'm a big fantasy fan and I was absolutely astonished by the fact C. Paolini wrote Eragon when he was 15 years old. It is one of the greatest fantasy stories ever written (and yes, I red Tolkien, Feist,...). Paolini has one great talent: he can tell a beautiful story in such a direct and emotional way. No sideways, no fake tales of San Francisco, just straight ahead. People must read the second book to get a complete view of what I mean.Now, it is just stupid to go and compare book and film, because if you do so; the film is a big mistake... It's too short, doesn't feels the book at all and messes up the total storyline. And then I didn't spoke yet of the fact the film just brutally murdered some important characters. (Where are the dwarfs?) Let's just not do that and give the director (it's his first movie, for Christ sake) a chance. A little one... The cinematography and the special effects in the film are great, Saphira looks real (thank God for that) and Arya is just the girl I imagined. The acting is good enough and the story is not bad (if you, like I said before, do not compare it with the book). So all with all not a bad movie.It's just sad that the book gave the makers so much potential, but they didn't used it at all... The film just doesn't stand against the perfection of Lord of the Rings (and let's face it: that book was much more difficult to film), neither did they ever give me the slightest sense that they knew where the book was all about. Friendship, loyalty and brotherhood. How could they forget? I wonder if the director even red the book at all...Grtz, Thomas",Eragon

Well, to this I have only one thing to say: get the heck over yourselves. This movie isn't trying to be like Lord of the Rings... it's trying to be like the book it's based on. As to whether or not it succeeds here is beyond me, because I have yet to read the book. I will say, however, that the movie is exquisite. I absolutely loved Dragonheart, and I absolutely loved this one. The musical score was a tad overwhelming at times, but nothing to take away from the overall score of the movie.",Eragon

Why is it that a movie can make so much money but still be seen as a failure and not continued. Is there a problem with making only 69 million 900 thousand dollars in profit.Seems like the studios are just getting greedier and greedier and this is why copyright must be reformed to allow others to take up the reigns and create the three movies again, so many would love to watch. They could make hundreds of millions in profit for little work. Damn if the first movie was able to be so good with such a small budget imagine what they could do if they just had to double the investment or even spend a million on a series that would make no less than 300 million.",Eragon

The story could have had more depth, but overall I don't think it was badly done. The acting was so so, but definitely not horrible. I disliked all the LOTR stories they are too dark, depressing, and come on what is the entire point of those long movies. This at least told a good story and I would like to see a sequel to this film... The special effects were great, and the setting spectacular, I wonder where it was filmed. Overall a very decent film, one I would take my kids to see.

IMHO even Rowan Atkinson would better. He has charm in his smile but that's all good in him. He can't act and can't speak.Still ... Jeremy Irons, Sienna Guillory, Robert Carlyle and John Malkovich made the movie better. Jeremy Irons' almost rude, but wise style is frenetic. Robert Carlyle has many faces that very useful to be the main evil.Finally ... that texts are a bit annoying.

1534,catfishhunters99,Terrible Adaptation,1,20 December 2006,"Everyone in my immediate family read the book, and my two boys are both big fans. They circled the release date months ago, and we while we knew this would not be a line by line recreation of the book, we anticipated it would at least follow the story. By the time we were five minutes in, we knew we were in big trouble. Two-minute long voiceovers setting up the plot are always a bad sign. If you can't set the story up with your opening scenes, you are not likely to tell the story with any imagination at all. As noted in other posts, major characters are cut (The Twins, Werecat)or reduced to walk-thru status (Angela, Murtaugh). The plot is completely redone-instead of striking out on a quest for vengeance against the Ra'zac, Eragon goes out to join the resistance against the King (although we have no idea why...except some Bad Soldiers do Bad Things in town at the beginning of the film). The subplot of Murtaugh being torn by his parentage, and fearing the Varden? Gone. The dwarfs? Gone, I guess-no one looks particularly small, but some of the characters might be dwarfs-we just don't know. The search for the Ra'zac that takes Brom and Eragon into the city, and introduces characters of importance in this book and Eldest? Gone. Eragon's fight to control his new powers-gone. The last one hurts especially, as it reduces the battle against the Shade into a cheesy fight sequence, instead of a test of wills. It leads to the elimination of the Twins, and forces a complete rewrite of the character of Arya. In the end, the writers took characters from the book and wrote a completely different story. A very poor story, at that. It is a cookie cutter plot with nothing interesting going on. A few incidents from the book get tossed in without reference, so you are left wondering what just happened if you had never read Eragon. The whole thing becomes a weird romance between two poorly acted characters who have zero screen chemistry. We all agreed this was simply a different movie, not a scripting of Eragon. Even then, looking at it solely as a new film without any expectation of following the book, I think it is one of the worst movies I have ever seen in a theater. Boring, poorly acted, and without redeeming virtue sums it up for me.",Eragon

Excited I was to watch the movie, but just 15 minutes into the movie and I was sorely disappointed.Here's what was wrong with the movie: 1. Horrible Story Pacing 2. A LOT of stuff was cut out from the book. Important characters having less than 10 minutes of screen time. Example:Murtaugh 3. Certain laughable dialog. 4. A 497 page book cut down to become a 1 and a half hour movie. 5. Complete Lack of character development. 6. The Story moves at too fast a pace which leads back to Point 2 and 5. 7. The Dwarfs are gone. 8. Lot's of important locations and events gone. 9. The Urgals do not look like what they are described in the book. They look more like big sized men with tattoos.Take note that I am not bashing the storyline or the book. I read the book and like it as a fun and enjoyable fantasy adventure. It's just that my expectations for the movie was too great, expecting it to be like Harry Potter or LOTR and I ended up disappointed.Perhaps I would have enjoy it better without reading the book.",Eragon
1536,zamina_lintras,The Time of the Great Disappointment,1,16 December 2006,"I was excited to go and see this movie, but I wanted to walk out while watching it, and that doesn't often happen. The people who made this movie might as well have never read the book at all it was so untrue to the original story. Most of the characters were poorly cast, the dialog was pitiful, the sets were cheap and the costumes were lacking. I expected much more. The only redeeming part in this film was Saphira. She looked very good, and sounded close to how I'd imagined her, though they didn't develop her nearly enough.Now here is the spoiler, and of all the things that ticked me off about this movie, this was the worst, so I'm only going to mention this one (though there is a whole list I could rant about): In the film when Saphira was a hatchling and Eragon was trying to teach her to fly, she eventually takes off into the sky, and flying she magically ages before our eyes. No this was not a time lapse scene...just stupidity. Dragons DO NOT magically age. They grow faster and become larger than humans, but never instantly.

But it is a shame that the story line in the movie was amended to a very bad one. That must be the reason they never finished the complete story. It should be a series of four movies like the books, the Inheritance Cycle, to tell viewers the complete story. The story of Eragon and Saphira really needs another Peter Jackson and Cristian Rivers. J.R.R. Tolkien would stand up from the grave if they messed up his stories (The Hobbit and LOTR) if they were told as bad as the movie Eragon. This movie needs a second chance but not in the hands of the same director. The actors were just fine. The young Eragon was just like I imagined in the books. Jeremy Irons is a brilliant actor. His part should be so much bigger as the character was in the books. Brom was very important for Eragon as his tutor. This was not very well pictured in the movie.

Stand alone the movie is OK, not the best fantasy, adventure movie out there but not the worst. But if you take into account this was based on a book it horrible. They took the concept and characters of Eragon and wrote their own story. Of course they cut out things, which is necessary so it's not a 6 hour movie but they also cut out things and changed things that make the next 3 books, and the whole plot as epic as it is. *spoilers from here on out* The movie was about a boy who finds a dragon egg, one of the last dragon eggs, which hatches and grows to full size in like 2 days, and when the king finds out he tries to have the boy, Eragon, and his dragon, Sapphira, killed so that dragon riders to rise again. stuff happens and Eragon and Sapphira live. THE END.The book however is (roughly) about a boy who finds a dragon egg which hatches for him, Sapphira grows over time (months). The king finds out, after months and months and tries to have them join him NOT KILL them because Sapphira is the LAST female dragon. rather being a simple story about a boy who finds a dragon egg and gets revenge like the movie the book (and the rest of the series) is about a young farm boy who together with his dragon grow up and become wise heroes who juggle with protecting all of the MANY DIFFERENT RACES (humans, elf, dwarfs, and dragon) and fight to depose a crazy murderous but powerful king who is a 1000+ year immortalSummary: if you want an hour plus of OK entertainment watch the movie if you want an epic journey filled with all sorts of fantasy and adventure, dragons, bad*ss battles, epic swords, life lessons and much much more read the books",Eragon

I went with my husband who knew nothing about the story, and I had read the book, multiple times. It was terrible, the acting, the story adapted to movie, everything. Nobody had any emotion that you could believe. You didn't care about the characters. Well, the ones they introduced. About half the characters from the book were left out, as well as half the book.

The movie is a realistic adaptation of the book. It does often jump around a bit, and some of the characters are stereotypical, and some of the lines were corny and cheesy, but considering the book they had to work off from, the director did a fine job. The movie was not awful. I enjoyed watching it.

This should have been done in the Lord of the Rings fashion. Directors and such should have spent more time in developing the characters in the movie and extending its length.

Most often than not, a novel adaptation never really seems to match up to the book. If you were to watch this movie with no knowledge of the book, then it isn't half bad. The problem with novel adaptations is that the readers form an idea of what a movie should be like for that particular book, and when it doesn't live up to their expectations, they complain. If you look at the Harry Potter books and films they are the same way. A lot of creative liberty is taken to make the films enjoyable in the few hours they are allotted for the film. Not every novel adaptation can the the LOTR, and even then there were things in the movie that did not match the book or were omitted that I personally thought were needed.If you look at this movie without comparing it word for word with the book than it isn't half bad.

But, as an adaptation of an excellent book, it fell short of my expectations. It seems to me as though they've stripped the book down to it's bare minimum. They've taken away all of the detail that made Eragon unique, made it more than just another fantasy about dragons. The plot has been twisted to the extent that it barely resembles that of the book. Prominent characters and scenes from the book have been reduced to something barely memorable after the credits start to roll. What should have been an epic tale will merely leave a fleeting imprint on your mind. If you have not read the book, you will probably love the movie. If you have read the book, try to resist the urge to compare.",Eragon
1547,lukescic,Rubbish!,2,19 December 2008,"This film had wonderful acting and wonderful scriptwriting... WRONG! Half the events in the book do not take place; and Saphira DID NOT get wounded! What happened to Isidar Mithrim? When was Arya unconscious? Brom wasn't killed by Durza, but by the Ra'Zac! The film was an insult to Christopher Paolini. A disaster. An utter disgrace. In other words, the film should not have even been published! Murtagh met them before the attack on Gil'ead! Eragon never used the branch spell! Saphira let Eragon into her mind when he saw like she did! Saphira didn't grow instantly! When I aw this film, I expected a work of art worthy of Christopher Paolini's name. But NO! I can't believe the scriptwriter DARED to approach the producers with that load of old socks! What happened to the training that Eragon went through? Where are the Twins? Is Ajihad psychic? How did he know about Murtagh? Absolute rubbish... It's not worthy of my time, nor of the 2/10 I gave it. Basically, the acting was the only good part of the film.",Eragon
1548,pinomof,Awful,2,25 August 2015,"I get that the story, even if I'm a fan, may not have been the most original and imaginative, but this movie took every single good thing the book had and canceled it. The trailer was better than the film. From the smallest errors (Arya, an elf, without pointy ears; the sword with a sapphire instead a ruby; the Urgals that seem badly painted warriors, instead of horned faun-like creatures) to part of the plot that later in the supposed sequels were important, like Roran, and the Ra Zac plot lines, this movie banalized every creative thing the book had. The consequences of this is that, also not reading the book, this movie seem like a rip-off, boring, with an ugly plot, that was done just because fantasy movies and books had success. If there was a way to make vanish this movie, I am all for it. The two stars are for the special effects, that were basically the only good thing of the movie.",Eragon
1549,blitzmatt15,Great Movie!!!,10,21 December 2006,"Many people have said that because they've read the book they think the movie is awful. I have read the book and it's sequel and am anxiously awaiting the final chapter of the inheritance trilogy. I've also read every Harry Potter and Lord of the Rings book and watched their on-screen counterparts, and I can't complain about anyone of them. Every time a book is made into a movie, things are left out and others are added to make it flow better as a film. I think the director did a great job of keeping true to the storyline and all though they did miss some things that I thought were important, I know that they will be included in Eldest when it is released in a few years from now, probably.My recommendation, is to go into the movie with an open-mind and don't listen to other people's comments. It's an entertaining movie, with convincing actors and quite possible the best book-made-movie I have seen in a long time.",Eragon

But the only thing keeping my mouth shut during this was that my friend sitting next to me would end up smacking me every time I even made a hand gesture towards the screen. I mean, come on, they could have done WAY better. I know the book is long and all,(and I'm not saying they should fit every little detail into it) but the writers/creators to this movie(as quoted by half the audience in the theater)""should be tracked down and shot!"" Harsh, but the feelings of hatred sure can make ya feel that way.Okay, now I do have to admit that Saphira was awesome! Cute as a button baby, and a kick-ass/p-ssed off make-your-dreams-come-true fantasy dragon. I guess that b*tchiness of women even run through interspecies? But yeah, don't expect too much out of this movie, or else you'll be starting a mosh pit in the theater.So if you REALLY want to see it, fine, be my guest..I hope you feel a wee bit better towards it than I.

Not only was it possibly the worst adaptation of all time, it was so choppy and disjointed that I don't think anyone who hadn't read the book could have possibly understood what was happening. I had to constantly shush my boyfriend, who was outraged. The acting was bad, the *new* plot was bad, and there was virtually no character development--a critical part of any film. I think maybe they chose to spend their money on special effects rather than a script editor. Poor Christopher Paolini *hugs him as he cries* Good luck to him writing his third book; but please, no more movies.",Eragon

So, I waited for over a year, reading everything in the magazines...all of which praised the movie, even if they were calling it a wannabee Lord of The Rings. So the time finally arrives, I drag my boyfriend along, even though he didn't want to come, because I told him it would be a great film...I WAS WRONG! This film i possibly the worst movie ever, even if i had not read the book and been able to spot all the major plot deviations throughout the film I still wouldn't have been able to enjoy it. The script was terrible, the acting was rubbish and Ed Speelers was awful...and why,for the love of god, did Saphira get thrown into the air and come down fully grown....it makes no sense!Where are the dwarfs???, and how are you supposed to even tell that Arya is an Elf??? Why were soldiers in Carvahall? Why was Farthen Dur so small??? I have to ask myself did anyone involved in this movie even read the book?

I was sure expecting a lot better than this crappy resume they made...! Perhaps the movie was really a bad idea. To take the best out of this trilogy i guess a TV Series with be perfect. The movies has what...2 hours and even if it had 3 hours it would suck anyway! From this point forward i can't imagine a sequel...with so many changes in the first i guess the sequel wont have anything to do with Paolini's sequel anymore!A 2 it is because i don't like the word awful!!,Eragon

After I saw the movie it made me want to read the book , and I can see why people who read the book first didn't like it, when they say it was based on the book they mean BASED, like the book gave them an Idea for a movie. If you go into it knowing that the movie is actually really good. Buy watching the movie first then reading the book it makes the book seem like Deleted scenes. I highly recommend This movie, but watch it first and then read the books other wise it may ruin the movie for you. But you need to read the books also ,because they are even more amazing!

1555,the_iguana_ate_my_socks,Disappointing doesn't even begin to describe it...,2,17 December 2006,"I read Eragon, and rather enjoyed it. It is, however, a pretty typical fantasy novel, with a lot of clichés, and seems to draw a little too much in the way of influence from Lord of the Rings. I went to see the movie just for the heck of it, expecting a mediocre show. Nothing of the sort was presented. You can't condense five hundred pages into one hour and forty five minutes and expect greatness, it just doesn't work like that. Eragon, who was a rather dull, typical character in the book, gets any semblance of life sucked out of him. Arya's entire attitude changes in the movie, and you don't really get enough time to care about any of the characters. When Brom died in the book, I was sad, but in the movie, I honestly didn't care, because you don't get a chance to like or dislike him. The dramatic revealing of Murtagh as Morzan's son has quite the opposite effect that it does in the book, revealed more as an interesting tidbit than anything terribly important. Also, things have been changed drastically for the sake of drama, it seems, including some truly gag-worthy dialog. I would keep a safe distance from this movie if you value the book in the least.",Eragon

The main character is completely unlikeable and the production values are TV mini-series quality at best. A real ""bandwagon"" franchise attempt, Virtually every scene and element of the film was instantly recognisable from where it had been stolen from, if you are going to ""borrow"" elements from more accomplished works at least try masking them a little not just making them worse and changing chacters names. I expected little from this film but came away disgusted and honestly quite angry that my favourite books and films had been Plagiarised so openly.

1559,Kellix123,Horrible movie from a great book,1,18 December 2006,"Eragon, first off I want to say, I read the book, this was a travesty to that book. The director literally shredded the book. This is a prime example of a movie that Hollywood pushed it out as fast as they could. The only special effects that were decent were the Dragon. They changed the whole story around. My girlfriend read the book too and was appalled at what the director did to it. The costumes looked like rejects from the Lord of the rings, the ughals in the book were supposed to be orc like they were humans. This movie was a piece of trash from the word go. My girlfriend commented in the first 20 minutes that it seemed like a mid-afternoon made for TV movie. This movie was that bad. It also shows that the author is a movie whore, like Michael Crichton, who doesn't care what they do to his work as long as they make money. If I could give less than one star I would. I wouldn't recommend my worst enemy to go to this movie. If you read the book, it's going to appall you what they did to it. In one word this movie sucked, don't go, don't rent, and don't bother. They destroyed a great book. Also as far as the book, the book editor should have checked for plagiarizing, because Christpher Pailionoi copied Star Wars and wrote this story.

Key characters like Katrina, the love interest of Roran (Stronghammer of ""Eldest""), cousin of Eragon, among others.Like always in a movie that is a book adaptation, the viewer must put aside the book a bit, because almost never it's possible to pass it to the silver screen integrally",Eragon

However it wasn't as bad as i thought it would be, the graphics for Saphira itself were pretty good, and i loved the baby Saphira, i wanted one! the voice for Saphira however was a little tedious to begin with. Also i thought Ed Speelers was really good as Eragon. On the point of being based on the book they basically destroyed it, at least 60% of the book was missing, no dwarfs, no character development whatsoever, nothing about how Eragon's scar from the shade was going to effect him, stuff shoved in that really didn't happen and no solebum, jeod or Katrina all of which are pretty important in Eragon and in books later to come, this is just to name a few.

The narration is boring from the very beginning, where a voice (probably Irons's) explains to us things that we could have easily derived from the movie itself, spoiling the experience for those that haven't read the book. Most of the dialogs in the movie are superfluous, explaining things to us as they happen, things that we can easily see for ourselves. Those of the dialogs that are needed for the story's plot to advance, then, are either idiotic or downright silly, and many lines are almost copy/pastes from Star Wars or LOTR. I won't blame the actors, because they do their best to save that disaster of a story (as seen on screen). Jeremy Irons plays fine, Malkovich's acting is exaggerating and Speelers is okay.The only reasons I didn't sleep through the movie are the quite awesome special effects on the dragon and the spells (kudos, ILM!) and the dragon battle scenes. The soundtrack was, in my opinion, average at best and that didn't help much the movie either. But then again, a good score and excellent special effects don't make a good movie nowadays. They are considered sine qua non.Christopher Paolini, I like Eragon and Alagaesia in general, but for the ""Eldest"" movie adaptation, do yourself a favor and involve with the script some more.

The Urgals looked nothing like they did in the book(8 foot tall with spiral horns). Neither did Angela. And where was Jeod, Katrina, or Orik? Jeod and Angela were neighbors in the book and lived in a bustling seaside city not a primitive stick hut village. And where was Solembum? And then there's the dragon. Saphira had scales that shined like jewels, but they made her look like a dull gray with feathered wings! what dragon has feathers? And how did she go from a smallish size to large simply by flying through some lightning? The only thing that they actually took from the book were the names. The people did not match in personality or demeanor. And Farthen Dur was nothing like in the book. With today's CGI technology I am deeply disappointed by this effort.

It is a great adventure/coming of age story about a young man and his dragon. I thought the actors did a great job and made the roles believable. I don't understand the low rating. I know some detractors that were upset with the amount of storyline that was left out of the movie that was included in the book.

I believe that if they had alloted an extra hour of time, this movie would have been a 10/10 for me. Secondly, with any book to movie there are gonna be parts of the plot and even characters that are gonna be removed. The acting was decent for most of the movie. Though Jeremy Irons and Robert Carlyle were by far the best, as well as the voice acting by Rachel Weisz. I was disappointed that Katrina nor the Twins had not shown up in the movie. The lack of some of the character that play more into the next book/movie I would consider to be a problem. One of my favorite characters in the book was barely given 5 minutes on screen, that being Angela, who had a bigger part that she was given. And the absence of Solenbaum disappointed me very much, Eragon meets another werecat in the second book, which will probably also be left out. The lack of luster for the elves was upsetting, what happened to their ears? So much more disappointed me. But on to my point.I was finally able to separated the movie from the book after I realized that I also quite enjoyed the Harry Potter movies and books both. Sometimes you have to judge them separately to enjoy either and stop comparing them. If you are a serious fan of the book, I suggest either not seeing the movie, or see it with an open mind.",Eragon

If you have read the book, please don't go and watch the movie, it were 110 minutes of pure agony. The most I can say about this movie is that only the names of the characters came from the original story, the rest was just made up by the director of the movie. Of course, the time in which the story could be told was limited, but that isn't a good reason to make a movie about a story which was very nice, like this. I got the feeling that the movie was rushed out, without thinking too much about the original storyline.If you read the book, just keep it at that, don't think this movie will give you another view on the story like I did, because it simply doesn't.

To say that it was awful would be an understatement. I can understand a child's fairy tale, I can understand dragons (heck, Dragonheart wasn't that bad of a movie, and not only because of Connery), but the director's decision to make EVERY single ""good"" character not only a cardboard cut-out but also a naive idiot had me cheering for the only guy with at least *some* personality - namely, the evil wizard. But, of course, he was killed; not that it was unexpected, but at that point I was at least sure that the movie couldn't possibly be a bigger disappointment. So, to sum it all up in two words: DO NOT WATCH THIS MOVIE. Well, that was actually 5 words, but the point remains.

The story was slaughtered and altered almost beyond recognition, changed to the point I don't know how they would make sense of the sequel unless they don't use Eldest, the 2nd book of the series, and write their own. As disappointing as the lack of special effects were (the elves should have pointed ears-not that hard- and the Urgals are supposed to look like rams with horns, not humans, and the dwarfs were a mere 6 inches shorter than the humans) the most disappointing thing is that the movie showed no connections between the characters.

I was half expecting Eragon to be sort of like Lord of the Rings. HOwever i was sadly mistaken. The movie jumps from one scene to the next very quickly and in the process cuts out a lot of information that is actually relevant. There is no sign of a were cat in the movie when Eragon visits Angelas house in the lake scene that does not look real and it is not where Angelas house is, and Angela looks about 12 in the movie. She is in fact meant to be at least in her mid 30's. Saphira and Eragon do not have a bond in the movie, it is told them that they do and they don't, there is no sign of affection or anything like that between them throughout the whole movie and Saphira hardly speaks at all. The photography at the start is very poor and of bad quality. I do not recommend this movie. A lot of what happens is no way near of what happens in the book.

The story was simply Star Wars meets Lord of the Rings, and once you figure that out the movie is very predictable. It's just dragons instead of the Force. Come on, a young boy, raised by his uncle, who loses everything and must set out on an epic quest to save the kingdom/galaxy, guided only by an old hermit who is a remnant of the good old days of dragon riders/Jedi Knights? He even has a 'mystical sword.' A princess taken captive by an evil king? It all sounds vaguely familiar, except there are less X-wings and more dragons. There were even some scenes that distinctly paralleled scenes out of Star Wars, and scenery and characters that seemed to come straight out of LOTR.The redeeming aspect of the movie was definitely the visuals. Dragons are always cool, and this movie really gave life to Saphira. The actors did the best they could with the writing, although I would have liked to see more of John Malkovich. Perhaps in the next movies. The battle scenes were intense, well done, and fun to watch, and the special effects over all made up for some of the lack of story.Overall, it was an average movie. You can't really take too much off a movie just because it's been done before, and even though the story is very average, I am still going to see the next movies, because the movie did it's job it entertained me for two hours with some dazzling special effects.

There are millions of plot holes, zero character development, the acting is awful, and the CGI isn't even that good. Jeremy Irons is perhaps the single passable part of this movie, but even with his skill in acting he can't make cliché, trite, and badly written dialog any better. Most of the time I had to keep myself from yelling out ""What is going on? Why is that happening? Who is that?"" in the movie theater, because nothing follows any sort of narrative logic. There is not a drop of exposition in the entire movie, except for the twice-repeated history of Alegasia. Perhaps the second time the redundancy could have been erased and replaced with some character development or something that made the plot make sense. Aside from the myriad problems of the movie, the plot is complete ripoff of Star Wars. I don't say the story is a ripoff because Star Wars is a monument in movie story-telling. Eragon has stolen the main plot points in Star Wars and chained them together to form a haphazard, idiotic sequence of events. There isn't even an ending to this movie.

Eragon and Saphira were well done, although I did not quite picture either of them quite so, well, cute. The Urgals and Razac were quite disappointing, and were not the way Paolini envisioned them to us. The story did not have time to develop, and the effects budget was alloted only to the dragon and flight scenes. In comparison to LOTR it is a disaster, but on its own, it was not a bad movie. It is just the comparisons ... to the book, or to the LOTR effects where it falters. Someday in the future, someone will do a movie that truly reflects Christopher Paolini's vision.

I was highly disappointed, and I had the urge to throw something hard and messy at the theater screen.I kept wanting to leave the theater, which by the way I went to see the midnight showing, but I kept expecting them to maybe, just maybe pick up and start following the story line. Did they? Absolutely not, that's not what they're about. They're about gutting a good storyline and eradicating all self-respect for that book. I can't express how upset I was with this ""film"", daresay I call it that.",Eragon
1576,gabriel_davis,Massive disappointment.. Book is 100% better.,1,9 July 2007,"The movie was real REAL bad... on MANY levels.Firstly: Huge key plot points in the book, that over half of Eldest revolves around were left out. Namely Rorans love and engagement to Katrina; Almost every second chapter in Eldest follows that plot line. Jeod and other key characters that contribute a lot to the directions and revelations the story takes were left out of the movie altogether.Secondly: Very few of the movie characters match their descriptions from the book: ARYA's hair colour, her eye colour, her accent etc.. Even something as simple as her pointed ears (that later Eragon is supposed to receive in Eldest) wasn't even in the movie... The RA'ZAC, their whole persona was changed for the movie, the hooded, beaked creatures mounted on flying horses were changed to orc-like creatures covered in strange bugs etc... The Dwarfs in Farthen Dúr were changed to some gypsy race... And SOLEMBUM and ANGELA, well He wasn't even in the movie and She had only a few lines (and what was with her dress covered in bells?)... Even SAPHIRA, a totally CGI character, that they could've made to look like ANYTHING imaginable didn't even match her description, they even cut out her ENTIRE infant stage by making her transform into an adult in ONE flight... And the URGALS weren't even the monstrous creatures the were made described as in the book, the were just butch Hungarian guys in face paint...Thirdly: The locations didn't match their descriptions from those in the book either. Teirm, the huge stone walled, and totally fortified coastal city, with a massive central castle and bustling trade community was reduced to a few bridges and huts made of stick on a small lake... There are a lot more to mention, but too many to go on about..I don't know how they're going to tie the second movie to this one with such vast story differences and missing plot lines... The movie was a let down and failed to do Christopher Paolin's brilliant book any justice.",Eragon

I couldn't help but laugh and scowl during the screening. I was hoping for a ""Lord of the Rings"" type movie but ended up with some low budget ""B"" film! I would have happily sat through a three hour movie if it meant I could see the book accurately portrayed on the big screen. There is no way they can make a second movie because they killed all possibilities with the changes made and the several outrageous omissions! The only redeeming quality of this film are the special effects, but even they weren't up to par....look at Saphira's wings for goodness sake (bird's wings?!?!?)!!",Eragon

It's Horrible. It doesn't follow the book at all. So much was left out of the story that was very important in the book.Why Oh WHY!! did Christopher Paolini allow them to make such a piece of crap out of such a lovely and imaginative book!? Now, I pray they don't make 'Eldest' ... because it would suck just as bad as Eragon did. .. and who really wants to sit through another terribly short, utterly horrible movie?Maybe if we're lucky here in a few years down the road some one else will make the movie and do it right this go around... by then we should have the third book, and hopefully we'll get a whole trilogy of films that actually Follow the books!!

The only other minor problem was lack of flow, something which wouldn't have happened if Galbatorix hadn't been it. The Special FX were better than the Return of the King, definitely the best I've ever seen. Brom was perfect, Eragon was perfect, Saphira was perfect (except her voice was a bit high at times, doesn't really matter though), Arya was better than in the book, Durza and Murtagh was perfect. The movie critics out there who hate cheesy lines are simply being arrogant, I'm afraid to say. They don't realise that this is a rare kind of ""good cheese"", unlike the kind you find in DiCaprio films. It was these stuffed up movie critics who stopped Eragon being the biggest hit since the Lord of the Rings, which it worked for and ought to have earned.Special FX- 10/10 Casting- Rounded to 10/10Script Writing- 9/10 Setting- 10/10Acting- 10/10Total Average for Eragon- 9.8, rounded to 10/10",Eragon

But the plot had nothing to do with the book. It most so many crucial scenes and i personally thought disgraced the book. Brom came in at the wrong time, Ayra wasn't at all like she was described in the book, Murtagh came in at the wrong time, Uncle Garrow died in the wrong part of the story, the razack was nothing as described in the book, Roran left the story in the wrong way in the movie, Brom was to revealed way to many secrets (something he didn't do in the movie). My last complaint about it is how Saphira grew in the movie. It didn't show it at all, she grew in a matter of 15 seconds which was horrible. I didn't think the acting was bad, and the effects were really good, but for anyone who read the book...this movie was VERY disappointing.",Eragon

Rachel Weisz was perfect for the lovely voice of dragon specially with the bound the dragon and rider have she does have a sweet motherly voice..Jeremy Irons was perfect sucked he died ...Djimon Hounsou was a nice surprise..Joss Stone was in it have to watch again to look for her..John Malkovich didn't seem to be right for a evil king but have to wait for part 2 for that answer..im hoping Eragon and Arya get it on in next part...or at least see her in more armor form fitting of course.. either way loved it gonna see again.. went with a friend and i know my brother was waiting to see it as well so thats 3 have or gonna see it and like i said i plan on seeing it again...,Eragon
1583,isisublime,This story not only had great potential for a movie.,2,8 December 2018,This story this trilogy has all the makeup for a wonderful movie that attractive to producers would bring in a large some of cash. When given the chance the director either had pitiful funding or a lack of concern and nurture that this story deserved. The story I'm praising is the book Eragon AND following sequels. Perhans by some miracle a true director of attention will give the books the attention they deserve. -Christopher Wade,Eragon
1584,rach-4788,Want to love it but really cant no good,2,30 December 2006,Well what can i say down right depressing as much as i want to say this was a great film cause of how much i love the book and had been waiting so long to see the film it falls far from how expected. The whole film was a flop the dialouge gave the actors nothing to work with everything was rushed and to if someone who hadnt read the book watched it took a long time to fully understand it. Yes it had spectacular special effects and Rachel Wiesz does an outstanding job at bringing Saphira to life it just wasn't enough if your a fan of the book sure go see it if you think you can stand seeing how screwed up it is but otherwise i now consider if it was worth my $10 to go see it.,Eragon
1585,amberdadlani,"Maybe at the $2 theater, maybe",2,26 December 2006,"The ""Move over Harry Potter"" trailer is just HILARIOUS! I have never been so outraged at, or misled by, a trailer in all my life. I saw the movie last weekend with high hopes and was sorely disappointed. While I haven't read the book, I feel sorry for the author who must be horrified at the terrible portrayal. The characters are poorly developed and, without the book as background, seem to have no reasons for what they are doing throughout the film. While the plot seems as though it could be good if the film was half an hour longer, the film was so unrealistic I barely managed to sit through the whole thing. They should publicly retract the ""Move over Harry Potter"" remark; It is an insult to the entire cast & crew of the Potter films. This movie could never begin to compete. Special effects were very cool though. Best dragon I have ever seen.",Eragon
1586,Everchosen,"Good, but not what I'd hoped for...",7,17 December 2006,"As I went to see Eragon, my expectations were very high, as I loved the book. The movie itself is action filled and well played (exept by Joss stone... which was just ridiculous)but something is missing. I think the directors made a bad choice to exclude some of the (I think) important factors in the book. Eragon's training, the Kull, Brom's death, the Dwarfs (Which were almost non-existent except for Hrothgar.... who was as tall as a human, and lastly the fight in Farthen Dûr. I had hoped for a more epic, battlefield-ly kind of battle, instead of the cramped scenes that were made. I had also hoped for a more intense fight between Brom and the Ra'zac, and Eragon and Durza in the heart of Farthen Dûr. I can only hope that the Ra'zac will have the role in Eldest that they do in the book. Regarless, the movie was good, the effects were beautiful (I admit, I had feared what the Urgals and Saphira would looked like :)) The film, sadly, looks like its been kinda rushed, and I think they should've taken the time to film at least half an hour more (the movie is at about 2 hours). Nonetheless, as a fan of Eragon, I enjoyed the movie, and I think that all fans should go see it, if not for the story, for the intense action :) Have fun!",Eragon

Yes.,6,16 December 2006,"OK, here's the deal, I went to go see this movie with rather low expectations, I mean, I wanted to like it because I liked the book a lot, but I was afraid it was just gonna be an expensive Dungeons and Dragons. That being said, I really enjoyed it, the special effects are great, (Saphira looked awesome!) Edward Speleers does a credible job as Eragon and Jeremy Irons to me, is a perfect Brom. It was way better than what I expected and I walked out of the theater wanting to go see it again. OK, now the bad: it's PG, no action/adventure/fantasy movie should be PG. John Malkovich is horribly miscast as Galbatorix and is the typical, wooden stereotypical bad guy. (seriously, the casting director should have been fired for that choice)some of the creative liberties they took with the story are way too much for me (Angela's now a jeweled young seductress!?)

1589,christopher-d-thomas,"A Tip to Producers: Just DO the movie, and quit meddling",4,26 April 2007,"Hollywood is famous for shooting itself in the foot when it wanders into the SCI-FI/Fantasy arena and this is no exception. Eragon is a great book, has a great following and the genre has wide-spread appeal over a fairly large segment of the population. Just look at the success of the Tolkien trilogy and what can happen when a good story in this genre gets a serious treatment by Hollywood producers. On the other hand, look at the Dungeons and Dragons disaster that was undoubtedly caused by some producer with the ""great idea"" of adding a 'street-wise' thief (in the form of a Wayans Brother) and then making a laughing-stock out of the whole attempt. The low-budget D&D2: Wrath of the Dragon god was a much better movie, even if a bit low-rent. If studios and producers would work harder to create a product that is true to the people who appreciate the material in the first place, they will hit a home run every time. Eragon, while not as bad as D&D, was no LOTR based mostly on continuity issues and editing. The CG was great, Sienna Guillory, Robert Carlyle, Jeremy Irons and John Malkovitch are all great actors and the new kid acquitted himself well, but the editing and story flow was horrible. I feel like it was an honest attempt, but funding ran out somewhere along the way and corners had to be cut. A shame, considering this is a phenomenally popular series and could have been so much better.",Eragon

I didn't have to worry about covering their eyes either or explain any crude adult humor.I came on here to see when the next one would come and and was quite surprised to see it being trashed. This movie peaked my interest, made me want to go get the book, and was an excellent way to spend the evening with my family.It's pleasing to the eye and the story keeps you interested. There aren't enough good fantasy movies out there. I'm very happy to add this one to my collection.I'm so glad I didn't come here before watching it.

(and this i really consider hypocritical) get to see their names on the ending list credits, without having anything to do on screen (see hrothgar, for example). if this is what it means to have your novel bought by Hollywood then ... i wouldn't want to be a successful author.",Eragon

I have read the book and loved it and about the only thing they get right in the movie are character names and the fact that Eragon finds a dragon egg. Whole scenes are changed or just skipped over. But, it is not just that EVERYTHING was changed from the book, the movie is BAD on its own. The dialogue is terrible, the film feels very rushed and they hardly stay on one idea long enough to involve you in the story, the editing is bad, and I could hardly tell what was going on in the final battle scene! If you've read the book DO NOT SEE this moviethis movie needs to bomb so that they can never make a sequel!

1593,Donkeygem_51,A darn good yarn!,7,17 December 2006,"First of all : The Movie is not the Book. This is most important.The book is full of adventure mixed with a twist of comedy combined with a rich plot and defined characters. The movie, however, is a film of adventure, battles and straight up characters. So that the people won't get bored and hung down with the wordy explanations (like, for instance, in The Da Vinci Code), they have made it more straight forwards.This is brilliant for people who have never read the book and want to see a cool dragon movie with lots of punch. Because of the way Stefen Fangmeier and Peter Buchman made the movie, you would not get lost if you hadn't read the book. Some of the situations might seem a little odd, but otherwise it is all good! But, on the other hand...for people like me, who have read the book and then went to see the movie, you might be a little disappointed. Personally, I think this was a good movie, 7 stars at least, but five of those went to Saphira and the other two stars went to the human actors. For you guys and gals out there, it is best to forget EVERYTHING you know about this Book and embrace the movie as its own entity.So, if you like dragons burning things, guys riding around with swords and epic scenery, this movie is for you.

1594,jamaicanmeanna,Disappointment at its peak,4,16 December 2006,"I was immensely disappointed at how the movie hardly had anything from the movie. Neither did they have characters that I felt were VERY important to the plot. And they should have just left Galbatorex out. VERY, VERY disappointed with it. Eragon's cousin left in the movie because he didn't want to join the army, but in the book, he left because he was getting a job. How Saphira grew was weird and wasn't even in the book. The fact that Brom died and didn't have enough time to teach Eragon everything he was suppose to have taught him in the book was stupid. Eragon didn't even meet the dwarf and the twins when he was at the Varden. All in all, I think that they should have spent more time on the movie. I would have less disappointed with them moving the showing date back than I am with the quality of the movie. The acting was not even that good. Even Jeremy Iron's performance wasn't as good as he usually is. The only thing going for this film is the fact that Eragon and Murdock are both good-looking boys.",Eragon
1595,goddessngirl,"For the readers of the books, it was murder.",2,16 December 2006,"First of all, the movie starts with Arya and the egg. But the narrator explains about who she is which eliminates the whole mystery of her character right off. There was no character development at all. Eragon is totally downplayed in the beginning and Roran is there and then just gone. Brom was portrayed as a cranky old man instead of the compassionate story teller. I must say though, that Saphira's period of growth was clever and Saphira, herself, was fantastic. But, none of the characters had personality. Speaking of the characters' personality, it wasn't ALL the screenwriters fault. What was with Ed Speelers? His rendition of Eragon lacked substance. The battles were immensely cut short. SOOOOOOO much was cut out of the book. And for people with children, it should be rated PG-13 because the battles were pretty graphic and the Ra'zac were really creepy looking. For people who read the book, the movie will make you want to kill the screenwriters. Major things were totally screwed up. Brom didn't even die the way he actually did in the book! Arya was conscious pretty much the whole time so there was no ""oh no she's going to die!"" suspense there. It was pretty lame. I felt nothing for any of the characters throughout the movie because nothing about the movie made me want to care about them. Did Christopher Paolini sell out when the price was high enough? I don't know but I am shocked that a writer would allow his or her book to be demolished in such a disgraceful and mocking creation as this movie. The graphics were good and the music was too, along with the setting and they were the ONLY good things.",Eragon

I go in to watch the movie with the thought that this is the directors interpretation of the book and I respect that. With this idealism for movies I have been able to enjoy many movies because I typically don't care how good they are to the book. My view of the book is often different from others including the director so i typically try and forget my view to see the directors. Also it is a movie, and movies and books are very different things. So regardless of what movies are based on, I judge them movie-wise. I hate it when people say movies are bad just because they were not accurate to the book, or in their opinion did not do it justice.I have found a movie that this philosophy doesn't hold up in. This movie, Eragon, straight-out was horrible, if you had not read the book, so much character development is lost. Their is almost none at all. Many holes spring up throughout the movie and it is just rushed and way too short. I feel it had been made just for money, the acting was just horrible, it was made too quickly and overall the plot line and development, for lack of a better word, sucked.For those of you that complain about book to movie interpretations, DO NOT see this, it is worse then any thing ever done on terms of book to movie. For those of you that read the book and like to waste money, go judge for yourself, but in my opinion it's not worth it.On a good note, the CG was amazing, I mean it is some of the best i have seen, it is the only good thing in the movie and is the only reason i didn't leave.The book though, is pretty sweet, I recommend reading it.

I was so disappointed! I understand the complexity of adapting a book, but come on!!!!! Most of the book was left out! And Arya? Come on! she acts like a teenage girl who has a crush on Eragon! Did the movie writers/producers/director actually read the book? SO sad. I do have to say that I did like the boy who played Eragon although I believe that a lot more interaction between him and Saphira was needed. Their relationship is not fully explored in the movie and the movie makes it look as if Saphira was not as important as Eragon or as smart. Luckily, I don't think they are going to be able to make a sequel, since most of the charactrs were left out. It has been a sad evening for me at the movies as a whole.",Eragon

This book and movie is what happens if you take Star Wars, Lord of the Rings, King Arthur, Harry Potter, Anne McCaffery, and just about everything else in that vein, and mash it together. I don't blame the actors, though, as some reviews I've seen. Most of them did quite well with what they had. It wasn't even the direction, that was also decent considering what there was. It was the story and the lines. If you liked the book, you may like the movie; I did not like either but for the chance the movie gave me to laugh with my friends.

I had read the very bad reviews Eragon got, but though that it can't be so bad as all that... it could and actually it was worse than what most reviews say. Even though this may not be the worst movie I have ever seen, I can't recall them. If you will do you self a favor don't see this movie. Almost everything are wrong with the movie, from the acting to costumes to the dialogue, but the prize goes to the pacing. The movie jumps from scene to scene at an incredible speed, nothing is ever explained and nothing ever developed... It doesn't matter if you have read the book or not, if you have read the book you have a chance to follow the film, since you may fill in the blanks, but on the other side you will know how they have manhandled everything from the characters to the plot to the races. And I'm not a particular great fan of the book, but it'did deserve much better that this piece of cr.. . Last I have only three wishes; 1. Don't make the sequel, 2.

I am extremely hard to please in that area...this was very well done. I have not read the book, but after having seen the movie, I am planning on purchasing it at my earliest convenience.

Hearing that statement really impressed me. Finally, I finished the book and felt that the book was quite competent although I couldn't cease comparing it to Lord of the Rings when I read it. Both share the same background and theme except I would say Eragon still lack of something.I expected something good from the movie when I entered the hall but who knows that I would be terribly disappointed. The story has been shortened a lot and this made the plot seems to be out of place. If the movie can follow the sequence of the book, it would be more enjoyable. Changing the causes and effects of events drastically is like mocking the readers' knowledge.My opinion is that exaggerated dragon and fighting scenes isn't the only essence for a good movie.

I think if you were to examine the script of this movie and a Teletubbies episode they would almost be replicas of each other. I won't bother describing in detail the void of details that this movie presented. The acting, the screen writing, the directing, the cinematography, and even the CGI was not worthy of human experience. I think for Christmas I'll get Durza some chap-stick. He must have run out half-way through the movie. I'm very sorry to all the fans, it left a scar on my stomach? To those who were damaged the most by this film were not the fans. I think Christopher Paulini is rolling in sleep thinking about how in the hell could someone possibly make a movie that bad. My other guess is they had a very limited budget and CGI was the only cost that was hard to cover. The actors must have done it out of pure enjoyment, only to discover they had and will be the laughing stock of millions of devote fans leaving a battlefield strewn not with Urgals (that look like men) or Razak (rather mummies), but with dead fans exhausted by either the movie or by there own sword (or whatever blunt object was nearest them).

I couldn't put either book down, but I could not wait to leave the theater.This may be an okay movie if you haven't read the books or know nothing about the story, but I wish I had never spent my money or time on this excuse of a movie.",Eragon
1606,Cozbok4,Not the best,5,4 January 2007,"I agree for example Roran's reason for leaving isn't so he can avoid being in the army, and what about his Fiancée? she is very important to the sequel eldest, considering a lot of it follows Roran's quest to find her. it is appalling that the producers did not read the follow up so that they knew what they really needed to include, i mean i understand that they need to miss stuff out like Saphira's age. but what about Eragon learning of the ancient language, and i agree with the previous guy about the Gedwey insignia(the scar type of thing on his hand) in the ancient language i believe it is(possibly dwarf), he is known as Agretlam, which translates silver hand. and what about the giant stone that Saphira smashes in the Beor mountains. and promises to fix even though she does not know if she can, i sincerely hope that the producers rectify these errors in the sequel.all in all it is a relatively good film, but so much more can be added. it is capable of being an epic book to film. but the producers will have to rectify certain problems in the sequel if they hope to achieve anywhere near where Christoper Paolina's literary skill on the screen.",Eragon

I am not going to list every detail of plot differences, but to site a few : Dragon(Saphira) grows about 50 feet in about 3 or 4 seconds, thats a quick puberty.Dwarfs not in this? What the chum? Dragon battle fight? Not in book either.Perhaps there wasn't enough time to capture it all correctly but I think I would rather there not have been a movie and I think fans of the book might agree. If you have never touched a copy of Eragon then perhaps you and maybe your children will enjoy it? Otherwise this movie is a tad painful.",Eragon

The only good actor was the old man, probably because he was the only real actor in the movie. I didn't actually read the book which i heard was really good. Those who did read the book said the movie was a total downpour on it. Upside, there was a cute British boy in it! I think it was a bit of a waste of money and I wouldn't see it again. Don't get me wrong some people might have liked this but it was seriously a thumbs down.",Eragon
1609,hugogomes6,I risk me to say that we are before from one of the worst film of 2006.,3,7 August 2007,"In a fantastic world, Alagaesia, existed once upon a time a legacy of riders that mounted dragons and fought to loyalty to the king. But a rider became so ambitious that provoking a bloody war that ends up barely extinguish the race of dragons, remaining barely two, his and a still not emerging of the egg, that fell in the hands of a young hunter that lives with the its uncle, Eragon (Ed Speleers). Upon emerging, a strong friendship itself form between the two, and with her the worst situations arrive. The strong obsession of the tyrant now chosen rider king, Galbatorix (John Malkovich), who want to kill the last dragon. Eragon with the help of Broom (Jeremy Irons), an old person that conceals a revealing secret, and of their dragon, Saphira (Rachel Weisz), will go against the most fearsome threats, in name of a prophecy dictated in several years.With the success of the adaptations of The Lord Of The Rings and of the saga Harry Potter, a sort run grew to the gold in that countless adaptations are motive of film, mainly youthful fantastic books. Unfortunately no of them still obtained to arrive to the ""heels"" of the trilogy of The Lord Of The Rings. Eragon, written book by Christopher Paolini, a written youth of 15 years, was an inevitable work for to be adapted, the book was of such success that arrived even selling as much as certain numbers of the saga Harry Potter, in addition being I initiate him of a trilogy, the producers found in Eragon a cinematographic goldmine. Unfortunately some factors already was done doubts of the quality of such work, first of everything Christopher Paolini is not a Tolkien, did not I possess to written, narrative not even the imagination of this, Eragon already as book is a very dependent work of the other and despite of captivate thousands of fans did not I possess to same solidity in the world created by the youth writer in comparison by the master.As the book is driven to a public more young than The Lord Of The Rings, this film is reduced to a mere unconscious entertainment of inconsistent adolescents. To his structure is dedicated limited to a hour and half of film, by that this looks to be always in forward, the argument not even helps because this suffered the most greatest number of possible cuts for contribution of the reduction of the history, for times those cuts are replaced by ridiculous scenes of resolution, by example the instant growth of the dragon. Stefen Fangmeier transfers a poor achievement hurried in technical level.The characters are hollow and barely impossible of the spectator identify itself. The interaction between them is void and even the film possess big actors as John Malkovich, Jeremy Irons and Djimon Hounsoun, these do not pass from mere personages of ""paper"". But neither everything is bad, the special effects so very well obtained mainly in the characterization of the dragon, correctly with the voice of Rachel Weisz.Unfortunately the success of the film is sufficient for the output of a sequel, despite of the bad reception of the fans, that many felt defrauded. Even the sequel be good, will not be enough for put out the stain that was Eragon, I risk me to say that we are before from one of the worst film of 2006.",Eragon
1610,scott747,Me and my family really enjoyed this film and look forward to the follow-up,8,4 January 2008,"What a great film! One for all ages, and in particular if you were a fan of the Sword and the Sorcerer, Lord of the Rings and the like then you should enjoy this. The story was lot more easily followed than Lord of the Rings. My four year old son and seven year old daughter both watched it enthusiastically, especially my son who loves anything to do with the dragons and monsters while my daughter showed the usual signs of dismay at the slightest hint of violence or aggression (which were rare and in my view appropriately filtered). Eragon possibly suffered at the box office simply because the story is about a dragon (not as believable as a ring, say), so do not watch this film unless you enjoy this genre. The casting was in my view, near perfect. Eragon is probably best as a family film (maybe the girls will not find it as interesting as the boys) or great for those like myself who really enjoy fantasy. The graphics was superb, as was the set in Hungary although at times some of the graphic scenes were a little too dark. On the whole, a very enjoyable family flick. Bring on Number 2.",Eragon
1611,rohansylvester,Good Effects but bad plot,5,26 January 2008,Did anyone involved with this movie read the book. I did not expect the movie to be exactly the same but i expected at least they would be a bit faithful to the book. The only thing thats the same are the characters but quite a few of the good characters from the book are missing. I really expected more from the movie but i guess we cant expect a LOTR every time.The actors did an okay job but Rachel Weisz voice as Saphira's voice was the only good choice of the entire casting. The special effects were quite good I wasn't disappointed by that but special effects alone a movie does not make.final verdict: They could have made it so much better if only they had stayed faithful to the source,Eragon
1612,WildRoseCreations,not what great fantasy could be,1,16 December 2006,"LOTR and Narnia showed us that excellent movies can be made of fantasy fiction novels. Granted, the book Eragon was written for a young audience, but the way the movie butchered the majority of the plot (just in the first 10 minutes!) was mind blowing. Do they think kids are so dumb they wouldn't notice this? Perhaps the movie makers thought they could make it better? (a laudable goal). I only hope they do a decent job with Dragonlance, because Eragon sure didn't live up to my expectations. I am a huge fan of any movie with a dragon in it, but this one I don't even want as a DVD. This movie reminded me of The Avengers - great potential, poor execution.",Eragon
1613,tekwit,Never Read The Book,8,19 December 2006,"Hi, I never read the book, or had any knowledge of this story before seeing the film.That said, I really enjoyed the movie, it was paced well, and was very entertaining. I do agree that some of the acting was pretty uninspired, and had to laugh in agreement when I read elsewhere that Eragon wore a ""deer in the headlights"" look a little too well.As I said, I never read this book, but have seen many movies made to represent various books I have read. They rarely compare favorably with the images our mind creates while we are reading, and we are almost always disappointed in what we see.",Eragon
1614,Matomatic,"""I expected you to be more... well, more.""",4,15 December 2006,"I had high hopes last year when I heard that a movie adaptation of the fantasy novel ""Eragon"" was on the way. While the trailers and previews promised a share of action and effects, the end result was dramatically underwhelming. An avid fan of the books, I was horrified by the quality and inaccuracy of the movie.The greatest nuisance I experienced while watching this film was the nagging feeling - ""what happened to this chapter? Why did they change that part? Isn't this kind of rushed?"" Indeed, the pace at which the story moves along here is absurd. We see an incredible amount of time spent on some things which were unimportant, and then important plot details are rushed through. The setting and characters are also dramatically underdeveloped. Rather than the characters' powers and personalities being demonstrated, we are instead treated to Eragon's mentors telling him what they are capable of - often in one short sentence while the speaker is gasping from running or fighting.While book-readers who review this movie may be criticized for nitpicking at plot departures, there is really a terrific reason. I could count on two hands the number of similarities with the book (most of which consist of characters' names and correct genders). The race of dwarfs was removed entirely. Eragon learns a total of four magic spells (two of which were invented - pointlessly - for the movie). All real rationale for Eragon's actions is overshadowed or removed, and the plot is narrowed to ""get Eragon to the Varden before something kills him"". Gone is the revenge and resourcefulness - instead Eragon is usually pulled along by Brom with no real understanding of what he's doing. Sure, Eragon was inexperienced in the book, but the movie leaves him looking perpetually slack-jawed.A lot of potential was lost here. Jeremy Irons held down his role, however briefly his character appeared on screen, but Malkovich, Hounsou, and the rest of the nameless cast possessed the emotion and inflection of a 2x4. Even special effects were lacking; you'd think a movie about dragons and magic would be rife with nice effects to give spark, but these were weak and few in number. The entire film possessed the cheesy-factor of a made-for-TV sequel.Sadly, Eragon's empty-headed portrayal is largely indicative of this movie. Too rushed, too short (it seemed well under two hours), and completely undeserving of its title. Even my friends who have not read the book agree - this movie simply lacked.",Eragon

Eragon's graphics for the Sapphira were amazing, i couldn't believe how real life she looked. the make up design for all the henchman were creepy, which was perfect for them! the costumes were great. the acting was great. the filming was great. so all together, this movie was excellent. Ed Speelers played Eragon. It is his first movie to act in. People complain about that, but the character of Eragon, is a beginner for dragon riding. So the raw acting fits the character. The casting for others like Bram is that of an experienced older man. which Jeremy irons is an experienced older man.",Eragon

1617,abuck385,Hideous--and who could blame them?,1,10 January 2007,"Eragon the movie was a terribly paced, badly acted, and horrendously scripted nightmare. I can't say that I usually call the time I spend watching a movie wasted, but here was two hours sucked right out of my life. The pacing was horrible--a five-minute action scene followed my a two minute traveling scene followed by more of the same, alternating back and forth, does not an epic movie make. And yet somehow I thought I was going in to see the next Lord of the Rings--well, not exactly. I'm not that gullible. But that's apparently what the producers were trying to sell... The acting was awful. Ed Speleers, playing title character ""Eragon,"" was rather bland--he had about three facial expressions, those being ""sulky,"" ""heroic,"" and ""devastated."" There was no other range to his acting. Similarly wooden performances came from John Malkovich (Galbatorix) and Sienna Guillory (Arya), with the cherry on top being Rachel Weisz (Saphira)--shouldn't a dragon be a little more interesting? Apparently not. The only performance I could actually commend was Jeremy Irons' (Brom), but all of them should get Oscars for keeping a straight face throughout the heinous dialog. But here's the gist: who could blame them? This is the fault of the source material, although the scriptwriter and director couldn't done much worse by it. The book ""Eragon"" was written by a nineteen-year-old kid from Montana whom the press falsely labeled as a ""child prodigy"" because he'd started writing the thing when he was fifteen. However, what we got was not an original ""boy and his dragon"" story: we got a mishmash of StarWars, Lord of the Rings, and Dragonriders of Pern with a whiny brat of a hero. All of this comes out perfectly in the movie. By its lambasting by the critics, I'm glad to see that this is coming out. However, as a movie and not as a piece of bad source material, ""Eragon"" would be bad anyway.",Eragon
1618,dashiva08,God awful,1,13 February 2007,"Horrible acting for the most part, horrible directing, horrible script, horrible just about everything except nice work with the SFX and Rachel Weiz did the only good performance in this movie. I'll have to say Irons work in this movie is the bottom eater of his career. They left out much of the plot and characters. The Raz'ac which are still alive for the upcoming 3rd book were killed at their first encounter in this movie. In the book they encounter and battle each other at least 3 times in the first book. And they weren't even bird things like in the book. They were summoned demons by the shade that resembled a bunch a maggots with 2 eyeballs than a bird man. And the urgals were atrocious. Instead of being giant things with horns and stuff. They were short very ugly fat men. And Tyrian where Brom and Eragon meet Angela and Jeod...It was a walled port town that was all defense. In the movie it was 5 huts connected by bridges in the water. If you want even more rantings about this horrible god forsaken movie. message me or call me or whatever it is you do.

My friend (who has read the book) said it didn't live up to his expectation. The graphics weren't bad and Jeremey Irons was great in it! Maybe if they made it longer and added more detail into it, the book is quite long, it might have stuck in my mind more, because when i normally see a movie certain parts stick in my mind and i can say that none of the movie did.

1620,sabadi_4,Rushed and lacking in the spirit of Eragon's true journey,3,15 December 2006,"Incredibly disappointing. I've been looking forward to this movie for months and it was not what I expected at all. I get that things need to be left out and altered when making a movie based on a book but it was massacred. To me the point of the book was the journey Eragon was on and there was no feeling of journey in the movie at all. The whole movie felt rushed and way too short. It also felt as though it ended rather abruptly as though it is open for the next part of the story but so many things were twisted that are essential to the story of Eldest that I don't see how they will ever be able to flow from the movie of Eragon to the movie of Eldest. I also felt that the movie had way too many cheesy one-liners. I do have to give some credit to the movie though. Saphira was very well done and I liked Rachel Weisz as her voice. Also Jeremy Irons did make a good Brom and Edward Speleers was actually believable as Eragon. I am sorry to say that Sienna Guillory is not at all how I envisioned Arya or any elf at all for that matter. I clearly am a fan of the Paolini's books but I think the statement of the girl sitting next to me (who obviously had never read the books) summed the movie up pretty well: ""I don't get it. What was the point?"" If you are looking for a fast paced movie with pretty good graphics you may enjoy this but if you have read the books or are looking for any depth of story beware.",Eragon
1621,sarac631,Eragon is overall pretty good,7,5 June 2007,"The acting of all the actor could have been better, but we have to give Ed credit - it was his first film. I've read both books and would recommend them to anyone who likes fantasy. The story was spliced together pretty well, however if there is a second movie there may be some problems with Roran's (Eragon's cousin) story. But there were no slow parts in the movie unlike the book. At times i felt as if it took to long to walk, while other times I wanted them to slow down. The character of Murtagh was not as important in the movie as it should have been, he has a big part in the next book, and it will be hard to understand the gravity of the situation without that background - much like Sirius Black in the Harry Potter movies. The series is based on the Authurian archetype so of course it will be similar to Star Wars, but it does good by itself. It is easy to understand even if you haven't read the books. Overall it is a good children's movie.",Eragon
1622,terryhunsicker,The brutal death of a good series.,7,24 May 2018,"If you are watching this movie expecting a great retelling of the book series, your wrong. Oh so very wrong. The beginning of the movie proves this enough.
Moments after Saphira's birth, she's a full grown dragon. Literally moments. What took months of establishment took the movie seconds. 
If you think the movie will be accurate, your wrong. The first flight with Saphira is spent in her arms, with Eragon being held. The actual book however depicts Eragon on her back, and makes a point of his legs getting injured as his legs rubbed against the scales of Saphira. THIS WAS A MAJOR PLOT POINT!
Everything involving the introduction to the magic system is just wrong. What happened to the alley where Eragon was cornered? Oh and don't even get me started on the Raz'ac
Overall, a horrid retelling of a good book, which only proves that Hollywood would rather shove their ideas down the throats of established characters and such.",Eragon

The acting was not so bad and not so good, but due to the film plot and intentions I would rate it ""as good as it can be"". In my point of view, Saphira's voice was too fake, it sounded like if the dragon was not a normal being but a robot. The plot goes too slow for the genre and since it is a fantasy movie made for the family, I would have expected it to be a little bit more exiting and have more action, however, it's based on a book so if the book was written with a slow plot than the movie will possibly be slow, too. Out of these two or three negative details, I have to say that it is a good movie and that the whole budget was spent well to deliver entertainment, delightful images and a good time to the public.",Eragon

First of all the editing was crap, the dialogue was crap, the lead actor was crap, the dragon was crap, the effects were OK. I really don't want to dwell on how crap this film was as I don't want to keep saying the word crap. This film was Lord of the rings mixed with star wars, I kept expecting the dragon to say 'Eragon I am your father'. Maybe it was because I was on a date that I am so racked off with this film as I believe that if it wasn't so terrible that I would have got me some. The only saving grace of the whole film was when it finished (joke but true) was Robert Carlye who did his best with what he had. All I can say is I hope they don't make enough money to make a sequel but thats how it looks like it is heading. Anyway I have had my rant, got it off my chest and now feel a lot better.

They had the blue dragon and a red sword, and that was about as accurate as they came to the real story. The book is an incredible story written by Christopher Paolini (young man, hardly even 20) and nowhere in the book do the lines and dialog get as corny and cliché as they do in the movie. Special effects were great, the digital dragon with the soothing voice was nice but the epic battle scene happens in Eldest (the second book of the trilogy) The Urgals are not what they are portrayed as in this movie, and the Razac are men in Cloaks with beaks. NOT PEOPLE MADE OF BUGS! If you really want a story that captivates the legend of Dragons and the times in Algaesia, read the book. If you haven't read the book and go to see the movie, you can't follow the plot because its too jumpy, and if you did read the book, you become frustrated because so many things are left out.

I beg of you ALL to read the book, i mean they didn't even give Araya the elf POINTED EARS! IT Was atrocious, i can't believe Christopher Paolini let them release this movie. They skipped over more than half the book. They didn't develop any of the characters, it was just the most disappointing thing I've ever seen. I don't understand why they did not make it 3 hours long like most epic movies are nowadays and make a incredible film out of it. The book is perfect the sales prove its a hit. but the movie makes me angry, it upsets me that they turned a good piece of creative material into nothing and they got away with it. The only good things i have to say is that Edward Speleers who plays Eragon can thankfully act unlike a certain Harry Potter who every time i see him on screen makes me want to choke. And the special effects weren't bad, but then again the director never directed anything before this, he used 2 work for ILM, it shows. FIX IT PLEASE AND DO NOT MAKE ELDEST LIKE THIS MOVIE!!",Eragon
1627,andraes,does not do the book justice,3,31 December 2006,"A 'Hollywood version' of a good book. The characters are not developed and the story-line is shallow. The movie seems to be a vehicle to show off various special effects, rather than the special effects being a by-line of the story. With the exception of Jeremy Irons, the actors appeared to lack empathy with the characters they were portraying. This may have been the fault of the script and/or direction, rather than lack of ability on the actors' part. Whatever the reason, the outcome was a disappointing movie which does not do justice to Christopher Paolini's story. Very few of the story lines that are continued and developed in Eldest are addressed in this movie, leading me to wonder how the second movie of the trilogy will be made. It appears that the movie is made by people who do not understand or care about the book - maybe they just saw an opportunity to cash in on a fantasy story following on the success of Lord of the Rings and Narnia.

How did the dragon grow so fast in 2 seconds and thats not even movie time that was really how long it took in the movie. This isn't just a disgrace to fans of the book or fans of any fantasy type book but even a disgrace to movie lover in general. Thank god the Harry Potter movies have had a good run with directors that know how to make a book into the movie THe movie should have been longer and gotten a new director.

The actor playing Eragon is so fake and bland it almost makes you angry watching him. I agree with others here that the Dragon special effects were pretty well done, but that is honestly the only positive thing I could think to say about this film.

She's so lifelike I feel like I could reach through the screen and touch her. If you love dragons like I do, then you'll love this movie. My only wish is that they would've made it longer.

There were some things about it I didn't like, because I have read the book, but most of it was generally entertaining. My advice to other people reading this, go see it. It's worth seeing at the theaters at least once. The cast was a very good choice of actors, I am pleased with the kid that played Eragon.

Look, I'm no ""every day"" critic, but maybe, just maybe, hiring the guy who crafted Jurassic Park 3 was a really, really bad idea. Buchman needs to find a different trade, cause he writes like a bull-whore with a shovel up her ass.Next, Stephan Fangmeier directed his way into the worst edited movie I have seen in a while.

I don't know what ran through these people's minds after they ""finished"" editing it, perhaps they were just happy to get it done, or they had already spent their money, but I can only imagine that they were completely drunk, or stoned, or simply retarded. But let me sum up my points of contention: -Dialog sucks. It's juvenile and stupid and the dragon's lines, what she says, how she sounds when she speaks--all terrible and poorly crafted.-The editing is amateurish and choppy.-The acting is pathetic. Not enough Malkovich, his character was great. Irons had his moments too, and maybe it was just the bad dialog that sunk his character. Edward Speleers ability to get his lines out rivals the talent of Hayden Christiansen in the Star Wars prequels. Overall, the acting was second rate.-The dragon riding scenes are poor at best. If they wanted to make a first person shooter game, thats one thing, but as a movie, the scenes are nauseating and fake.Overall, I recommend this movie to anyone under 10 who likely doesn't know enough to know this movie sucks. Everyone else, read the book and don't waste your time with this shotty garbage.",Eragon
1635,C9dan,Catastrophe with no direction!,1,11 August 2018,"Not allowing Paolini have any control over this movie was a HUGE mistake. In what world would that be okay for a book to movie adaption? To compensate did they scoop up titans for their director or writer? NO. We had no names creating this movie without any direction or consultation from the writer of the book himself. The end result? An ill-paced movie with boring characters and a plot that doesn't even attempt to stay true to the novel. The only ""positive"" you could take is that the visual effects were decent for 2006. It breaks my heart that the series was effectively killed by this abomination of a movie, because I thoroughly enjoyed the novels. 12 years later I'm still patiently waiting for a remake, because this movie will never be watched again.",Eragon

HOWEVER, I still remember the odd bits that were missed out of the film! What happened to the trek across the desert?! With the sand storm?! And Brom does NOT die where he does in the book! And I may have gotten this wrong but surely the dwarfs lived IN a mountain! Not in a silly little clearing on the other side of a waterfall?!!? And what happened to the amazing sapphire that the dragon kills?! And so many little bits are wrong about it! Like when the dragon and Eragon first talk to each other, and the dragon learning to fly and breathe fire...I could go on and nit-pick but I wont lol. The dragon is rather cute though as a baby, but is it me or are the dragon's wings rather like bird wings? I personally went with the traditional style bat membrane type wings. Oh well, despite from the rather fast moving, and missing massive story lines out it was sort of OK, maybe for those that have never read the book. But then again you might be REALLY confused about the character names, even I got lost and I have read the book :S I just thought I would release my built up annoyance for the film, I recommend reading the book rather than watching the film ^_^",Eragon

And the plot is simply stupid, it makes no sense at all. For those who read the book, don't even come near the movie. This is not the case of an adaptation of the book... this is an all new story and completely ridiculous.Dwarfs don't appear in the movie... elfs don't appear in the movie.... werecats don't appear in the movie...Urgals are simply humans with red eyes. A character named Angela is described in the book as an old lady, the actress who plays this character in the movie has something like 23 for years old. Eragon is supposed to have dark hair and brown eyes. Some of the main characters are left out of the movie or don't have enough time on screen. The only good thing in the movie is the CGI for Saphira. I left the theater with the sensation of someone who had been stolen. This is a movie for kids with less than 10years.",Eragon
1638,dzwissler,The worst movie of 2006 by far,1,19 December 2006,This movie sucked beyond all belief! The acting was horrible.. The screen play was the worst adaption from book to movie that I have ever seen! The voice of Saphira should have been a more powerful voice like of Kate Blanchette or something.. The kid that played Eragon was only given like four letter responses.. I just thought this was the biggest waste of money that I have ever spent at a theater and this includes bench-warmers! Absolutely disappointing! There were also other people in the theater that were absolutely disgusted with the way it turned out.. They were booing way before the movie was over.. The only part of the movie that was somewhat entertaining was when he was in the market place area and used one sliver of magic.. That was it.,Eragon

The actors, the script, the director...Everything sucks, right? No.In comparison with Eragon, the movie of Courtney Solomon is a masterpiece. Also, in comparison with any other movie, Eragon is a bomb. The director don't know how to use the technology, the actors don't know how to extract from the awful(really awful) history something good, the architecture and visual looks like some crap film of 80's. Sorry ""fans"" (virgin teenagers), but Eragon isn't a movie, is a p0o.Synopsis: ""When Eragon finds a polished blue stone in the forest, he thinks it's the lucky discovery of a poor farm boy; maybe now he'll be able to buy food for the winter for his family. But when the stone turns out to be an egg from which a baby dragon is hatched, Eragon realizes he has stumbled upon a legacy nearly as old as the Empire itself. Overnight his simple life is shattered, and he is thrust into a perilous new world of destiny, magic, and power.With only an ancient sword and the advice of an old storyteller for guidance, Eragon and the fledgling dragon must navigate the dangerous terrain and dark enemies of an Empire ruled by a king whose evil knows no bounds. Can Eragon take up the mantle of the legendary Dragon Riders? The fate of the Empire may rest in his hands."" Go back to Playstation, Paolini...",Eragon
1640,llewellyn-4,A great fantasy film,9,19 January 2007,"As Director Steven Fangmeier said, this is not LOTR or Harry Potter, it's a great fantasy story on it's own. I watched the movie before reading the book. I loved it the first time, watched it another 2 times and went to buy the Alegaësia boxset. I read both books non-stop, and what an incredible read. After I finished the books, I went back to watch Eragon one more time, and I still love the movie. You can never compare a movie to the book, but I think they did a great job of the movie script. The way that they changed some of the main characters' personalities and even locations and the final battle scene was essential for the big screen. The movie wasn't overly dramatic like the last two Harry Potter films, and I think they did a great job of capturing the essence of the story. I hope that they continue with this line of production for the next two movies. If you want to compare this to another movie, I would say ""The Never Ending Story"".",Eragon
1641,marmanukem,Can be entertaining at times,4,26 March 2007,"I read the first book, and am reading the second. The writers of the movie butchered the story line, and don't let the movie scare you away from the book, as I enjoy them very much. The movie skips through scenes way too fast, either they should have picked scenes to focus on, or make the movie longer, and definitely cut out all scenes with Galbatorix, since he makes no appearances whatsoever in the book. Very poor dialog, but the movie is saved by the times where you are swept into the moment, with an appropriate dramatic swell in music. I really think that this movie could have been so much more, and I hope that they try to remake it at some point. Jeremy Irons plays a great Brom.",Eragon

After stepping out of the theater I literally wanted to ask for my money back. The Eragon trilogy is a very magical and epic story. Considering the turnout of the movie, it would have been better if they hadn't made a movie to begin with. Some of the best characters of the book were left out, just so they could squeeze in a laugh. Much of the plot that needs to lead on to the second of the trilogy was not involved. If they ever wanted to make a second movie they would need to remake the first movie. This movie could show as an example for future references on how not to make the Eragon movie. To get a better turnout, the movie needed a better director, producer, writer, budget and cast.",Eragon
1643,crstfr_pancake,it sucked,1,14 December 2006,"I was extremely disappointed with this film. I had read the book just before I saw the film and I loved it. Then I went into the cinema and saw that the director of this film had taken this wonderful story that was written by a 15 year old, and completely ruined it!!!!! There was so many unnecessary changes some of them quite major and also apparently changes that affected the sequel to Eragon making it useless. Although if the sequel is as bad as this was then maybe its a good thing if it isn't made. This is a great story and if the director had been willing to make it longer (only an hour and a half) and stuck closer to the scrip it would have made a much better movie. It's not as if it would be a boring film if you stuck to the novel. There are some pretty exciting scenes. I was appalled at this monstrosity of a film and it should not be allowed to exist. I know it was the directors first film but perhaps he should have chosen a less complex and popular story. Where can I find him to get the 1 and a half of my life back?",Eragon

I am a big fan of dragons and creatures that are considered not to existed. I can't shack the feeling the that there was something important missing from the movie, maybe if there was a shadow character that was not fully reviled just yet. Maybe a sister he didn't know about and I don't know if anyone like this is reviled in the next movie because I haven't seen the next one.

I'm so so so disappointed how they could bear to show this i mean did any of them actually read the book, they only good actor was the person who played eragon. I'm so frustrated, and what was with arya leaving at the end? eragon is meant to go with her, this movie is basically a bunch of lines thrown together and doesn't deserve the name of the fabulous book eragon!!",Eragon
1646,marcioneves,Simply an offense to the book...,2,15 December 2006,"My first thought related with the movie: ""It is an offense to the book, and to the writer"". The only thing that reliefs me, is that the story diverges so much from the original, that, apart from the names, there is nothing that connects the book to the movie.... You can consider the movie a fraud. I will never see nothing from Mr.Stefen M. Fangmeier again... Bad storyline... Bad character interconnection... Bad cuts... Bad soundtrack... Is there some kind of distinction between races in the movie ?? Is there any elves ??? Is there any dwarfs?? How about a map that situates geographically the story ??? Can I have my money back ?",Eragon
1647,flour_girl70,It was not worth seeing,1,29 December 2006,"After reading the novel several times, this movie was a great disappointment. With todays technology, and theatrical ability's, I was expecting it to at least stick to the story. It however did not. Some say that this movie would be fine if it were not be the representation of a well written novel. However I disagree. It was to fast, things rushed at an alarming pace, and it left you bewildered, and confused. If you've read the novel then you will be displeased to know that all of there characters were changed. Instead of a cautious and weary Brom, we have a man who's only aim is to get Eragon to the Varden. We find that although Eragon is a hunter, he will rush into places, and situations without thinking. Murtaugh ""knows the Boer mountains""(not exact quote)and willingly goes to the Varden. Angela, is this creepy women in a huge headdress, who is totally creepy, and offers her fortunetelling skills to anyone who wanders into her shop. Solembum does not exist. And Arya openly tells Eragon that she is a princess, she also some how becomes poisoned, long after leaving Gilead, and a trip across Alagaesia that in the book took three months only felt like two weeks. Ajihad does not release Murtaugh to help fight the battle, instead he breaks free, loosing everything that was Ajihad. Murtaugh was also locked inside a jail cell, instead of being cared for. There is no Farthen Dur, in its stead is a community that can grow crops, and lives in little huts. And although the novel mentions that Saphira can not even climb to the top, the top is so low, that you could through a rock and hit it. On the same note, the novel mentions that the Varden were having a rough time, because they could not grow crops, these people, walk around wearing very elaborate dresses, covered in gold. It reminded me of Hobbiton to tell you the truth. Also Eragons cousin looks like he's his identical twin, while Murtaugh doesn't look like he's related to Eragon at all. Another thing, if you care at all about costuming, Eragon, can't afford meat, but he can afford perfectly tailored leather suits. It's just not right what they did with this. All in all this movie is not worth seeing, and needs to be re filmed, by someone who is passionate about this story, some one who has read the books, and knows what their doing. I also believe that Christopher Paolini needed to be present for most of the filming, then perhaps this movie wouldn't have been a Hollywood Chick Flick.",Eragon
1648,tabshier,Movie did the book a total injustice.,4,4 May 2007,"I have been an Eragon fan since the first books release, and awaited anxiously for the movie. After the premier I just stared at the screen thinking ""That's it? Really?"" And it made me sad to hear people saying ""Glad I didn't waste my time reading that book."" They concentrated more on special effects than good plot development and good acting. I understand that the entire book can't fit in a movie, but they focused on the unimportant parts of the book and didn't even make a decent length movie. I think the main problem was they were shooting a for a younger demographic, and didn't put some of the more important scenes it because they would be too graphic. But considering the average reader of the books is between 14 and 18 years old, they could have easily made it a PG-13 and made an awesome film. This movie had the potential to be as good, if not better, than the LOTR and Harry Potter movies. But in the end it came across as rushed and not thought through, like it was all of the casts first film. Most of the acting, especially Galbatorix, was stage-style acting, which is completely different than film acting, and seemed unbelievable. When I watched LOTR and Harry Potter, it felt like I was in that world, it was real and honest. This movie just never took in the audience. I was very disappointed, but as a die-hard Eragon fan I will still probably buy the DVD. If you like the movie, you'll be blown away by the book. If you don't like the movie, please don't let it discourage you from reading the books, they're great.",Eragon
1649,burningchris,not good,2,26 December 2006,"major disappointment. i think the director has add or something. it was so rushed and choppy. it needed to be a lot longer. the story deserved more than an hour and a half and so much was wasted on stock shots and pointless shots of eragon riding a horse or saphira to some faraway destination. much of it seemed to lack any point, with a generic studio produced soundtrack that could have come from any of dozens of movies.i think the studio was a little nervous about spending too much money on the first movie of three before they see how well the series should do. probably crippling the whole thing.and yeah, some of the basic story was ruined. characters were changed: eragon appears much stronger in the movie than in the book. horst, orik, and the twins just plain do not exist in the movie. all the faults in this movie come from bad decisions on what to keep from the novel and what to cut out. if you still want to see it, wait for the DVD, maybe it will have several more deleted scenes.",Eragon

The story-line suffered immensely from it.If you take the book, and flip thru it, take a sentence on each 3rd or 4th page, and visualize that. Then you take each of the parallel stories, the hidden hints and associations, and you boil it down to one sentence and reveal them in each scene, and then you have this movie.Not one of the stories have survived, not one of the twists is revealed in a proper manner in the movie.It's OK to cut parts of a story out to make a visual presentation, but this movie cuts out the plot it self.How they can make a followup of this piece of *beep* (something than usually smell really really bad) is beyond me, they removed all the plot-twists that allowed Eragon to make room for the ""Eldest"".I will NOT ruin the ""Eldest"" by seeing the movie (if ever one is made), unless off-course, they manage to get some promising director to direct it...

As with many of the other messages on this page, I most whole heartedly agree with the applause for Rachel Weisz's performance. The special effects were passable at best. Story elements where unnecessarily changed or cut out completely. What was an engaging book has been turned into a long episode of a Saturday morning cartoon, minus the enjoyment. Scenes which needed development were left for the janitor to write and the street sweeper to film. I was looking forward to this film. I had high hopes that it would fill my Lord Of The Rings needs. Unfortunitly, it made me want to watch paint dry, with a bit of growing grass on the side. I have watched a lot of rubbish in my time. Most of which i have partly enjoyed. This however is a missed opportunity. Please, please, please don't let them make the second or third books into mind numbing piles of pointless celluloid, if at all.

Also the movie makes it seem like it happened in a week. As everyone who read the book knows, it happened over about 4 months.END OF SPOILERS The movie also skipped through the parts were he discovers his magic in town. It also distorts the time-line and messes up how everything happened. Another thing that bothered me was how short the movie was, but I guess they just had to work with it.So all in all, i was pretty unimpressed.

Actually I didn't even pay for my ticket and I felt as though I had wasted my money.The acting was terrible, for the most part, and the storyline definitely left something to be desired. There were way too many cheesy lines and so many scene cuts between concepts that you almost felt like you were watching the preview for the movie instead of the actual movie. The final battle had no real ending. You see thousands of enemy soldiers coming in to destroy a tiny army and somehow, without seeing how, they defeat them all.The other thing is that I am not sure how it got a PG rating. It was way too violent in my opinion for that. Sure, there was not swearing or anything else, but I felt uncomfortable by the fact that we had taken a 9 and 6-year-old to the show. It had that ""Lord of the Rings"" violence feel to it.I don't know how many of you have read the book, but they also changed a number of things in the movie. None of it was plot line essential, but left a weird taste in the mouth. As far as the book goes, if you really want to read it, borrow it from someone, get it from the library, or pay no more than $5 for it.Why am I taking so much time to be a film/book critic about one story?

I am not the only one who feels this way.The fight scenes looked like LOTR knockoffs, I just...utterly despised every minute I spent in that theater. And, ten minutes to the closing scene, they were no where near wrapping up the plot, whatsoever, perhaps because the plot was all over the place.I don't begrudge Paolini in any way whatsoever, rather the man who wrote the dump of a screenplay.Don't waste your money, or your breath.

I enjoyed the book but had no expectations relating to the quality of this film at all and somehow it still managed to inflict bitter disappointment.If you have read the book DO NOT suffer a viewing. They took about ten percent of the plot and three of the locations from the story and then proceeded to attempt a shameless cash grab riding on the novels popularity. The dialog is the stuff of clichéd action movies that are not made to suffer the indignity of theaters. The acting features terrible, completely insincere performances. The pacing is ridiculous. I can only assume the director previously worked in pornography, every time the horses are ""mounted"" epic action music starts. This of course is fantastic because nothing says epic like riding through stolen Lord of the Rings cinematography.The ending is anticlimactic and the fighting is more so amusing than exciting. Jeremy Iron""s is the only tolerable character, when he died the rating of two I would have considered giving this died with him.I would like to say that this was just eye candy for young readers, (Hollywood obviously believes children who have read this are mentally unstable enough to enjoy it), but then there are the uncomfortably and stupidly sexual ""Eragon in tight leather pants without a shirt"", and ""Arya enticing Eragon to follow her into the woods"" scenes.There is also zero camp value, I tried to laugh my way through it but the production was obviously taken seriously.In short I recommend it to no one! Avoid this cgi dependent Hollywood turkey at all costs. Eragon may not have been an epic novel,but it deserved much better than this.

And what is the deal with the urgals? All they were was humans with lines on their faces...in the book they were described more like trolls with horns! Like I said before there is absolutely no way that the person read this book! And the sad thing is the critics are dissing the author for this horrid movie when the truth is its the directors fault!

First of all I must say that I loved the books and i'm looking very forward to the 3rd and know about the end of the trilogy. Now about the movie... Much like Harry Potter's, which is a story that I loved (I've read each boom about 20 times) I got very disappointed. The books were great, the movies were awful and are going from bad to worst. About ""Eragon"", the only thing I like in this movie was the special effects, even though Saphira does look to have feathers in it's wings. After reading such a great story in Eragon's pages I was looking forward to watch this piece of art... now i realized it's nothing more than a piece of crap. Bad acting, to much of the initial story cut, and way too many invented parts. The only part I really liked was the fresh-born Saphira. The movie really nothing to do with Paolini's excellent written and imagined story. Sorry folks, but I think the best way to improve is receiving critics and learning from our mistakes.

He brought the characters to life, made you feel with them, and for them as they braved the perils of a hostile world. Eragon is young, reckless and fearless - but soon learns more about himself and his Dragon then he ever thought possible.Jeremy Irons is outstanding as Eragon's mentor - doing his utmost to restrain a hot headed young man from jumping out of the frying pan into the fire. John Malkovich is the ultimate evil king. Ruthless, vindictive and easy to hate.Eragon was well worth watching. So its not LOTR or directed by Peter Jackson - but its a good movie and very enjoyable.

Certainly you can not put the whole Story of the first book in one movie, and some things might be changed to fit in, but this movie is telling a totally different Story in my eyes. It's too hokey, the film story/plot is ""shallow"", to much compromise regarding the representation of the characters.There is just one thing in the movie I can accept the way its presented and thats the animation of the dragon Sahpira.What's bugging me most is that people who never read the book get an false impression of it after watching this movie. ...The book is just great, please read it even if you are disappointed from the movie !!!

1661,dsomerfield,Eragon (excellent),9,18 December 2006,I will be bold and say that I enjoyed this movie more than the Lord Of The Rings and that I wasn't bored halfway through it. I hope that they will continue with a sequel. The use of the magic and some of the special effects were fantastic and the battle scenes were awesome. I especially enjoyed the way the storyline and characters were depicted and from how we got to know them and up to when they first met. Also how the more Eragon rode Saphira the more the powers increased. Now with most movies the good must have a bad and the villains in this case were no exception.

1662,mackenzieight,There was nothing wrong with this movie.,7,29 December 2006,"This movie could go one of two ways for the basic viewer; one, if you've read the book and are expecting a great film, don't get your hopes up. This movie follows the story line by a hair in most scenes, and sometimes the only thing that seems to match the book is the character's names. There is a great deal that could have been kept in from the books and still made a great movie.But, on the other hand, Eragon was not a bad movie. It was wonderfully executed. It contains everything that a movie needs to be, well, a great move. The actors cast were excellent at their jobs and fulfilled their roles perfectly. Jeremy Irons, Garrett Hedlund, Sienna Guillory, and John Malkovich all lived up to their reputations, and the newer actors (Christopher Egan, Edward Speleers, Joss Stone) brought satisfactory performances. Rachel Weisz nailed the part of Saphira. The effects were enchanting. There was no boring moment and everything tied in perfectly. At the end it gives you just enough to guess that there may be an (equally awesome) sequel in the future. The only complaint I had was that it was way too short, and could have easily added some great stuff to fill at least another thirty minutes.I went to see this film with two other family members; my sister, who has read the books, and my mother, who has not. My sister thought it was horrible, and doesn't want to ever see it again. My mom thought it was one of the best movies she's seen and was already asking when I thought the DVD would be out for purchase.Me? I have read the books and liked them very much, and I was warned that the movie didn't follow the book at all. I was prepared for a flop, but I got one decent movie and will gladly buy it when it's available on DVD. Please consider before seeing Eragon or giving it a bad review: this isn't a bad movie. You should see it in theaters, it is worth you're time. So, don't come to this movie expecting to see the book on screen. Expect a great movie.",Eragon
1663,obrigada,"terrible,sucks,stupid",1,27 January 2007,"the stinking move could not be further from the original story. it could have been a fantastic move but no.they tore my heart apart. harry potter was closer to its book.it may have been OK for those who did not read the book,but the acting was not so great ether.if you are going to make a movie of a book do it right.I'm sorry if i am being harsh,but the movie was not even 2 hrs long,come on lord of the rings was 3 hrs. they killed brom too early arya's hair is black not brown what was with Sapphira's weired growth spurt? if you have read the book and plan to see the movie,BE WARND YOU ARE GOING TO BE VERY Disappointed...VERY Disappointed.",Eragon
1664,ljcioppi77,"My thoughts on the movie ""Eragon""",10,13 February 2007,"This movie in my opinion was wonderful, well written, suspenseful, and of course whimsical. From the very beginning Ersgon will literally pull you in (that is if you enjoy medieval movies)and not let go. Making the watcher wanting more. It made me want one of those little dragons that hatch from an egg and become a rider too. As many movies have the ability to captivate you, I have not seen this story. Most movies seem to be remakes of an earlier flick. That is another reason why I voted so highly. Writers that seem to have more imagination and depth. Medeavil movies are my most favorite. Makes you wonder more of those times when you see a beautify made movie like this one. Could these things have happened, who knows...but I will always wonder. I would recommend this to anyone who enjoys these types of films. From early on Saphera (possibly spelled wrong) had chosen and found her rider. He grows with her as she grows with him. They are so closely linked to one another they become one. A passion unlike any other. The trust and belief in one another to the very end. I hope that you see this film and actually feel and see what I mean. I loved it!Linda Cioppi",Eragon
1665,jralmei,The movie is really good!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,9,14 December 2006,"I heard a lot of people trying to put this film down. And I say to these people: You're just jealous because the book was written by a 15 year old boy and most of us, including me, couldn't do the same. Of course there are points that already have appeared in other books or movies, the author himself said that the book was a homage to the Lord of the Rings trilogy. And also, lets face it: there is not much space for completely original ideas these days. Even Star Wars was a ripped off of a old Japanese tale known as the Forbidden Fortress; and Harry Potter is also a copy of the Books of Magic comics, with Timothy Hunter. And the fact is this film is entertaining, have great special effects, and a cool story that grows more interesting with time, and with the other book, that explore the characters more deeply. To end my review I say it's a great movie to see with families and friends. I promise you will have a good time with the movie and will go out of the screening room wanting to see the second part, and in the future, the conclusion in the third book.",Eragon
1666,razuberiiyuki,Great movie! A little fast paced but great acting and stunning effects!,9,28 December 2006,"Despite what others are saying about the movie, I really enjoyed it!! The plot was a bit fast paced perhaps but the acting was great and the effects were amazing! It was very easy to get completely involved in the characters and the story. Great action! The movie really keeps you on the edge of your seat the entire time! The movie does give the feel of Lord of the Rings or Star Wars but it completely stands alone as its own work. The movie did not completely capture the book but no movie can ever truly compare to the book. Given the length of the movie I think it captured the essence of the story very well. Going into the theater with no prior expectations, I was completely blown away and I would definitely go see the movie again.",Eragon
1667,shannon-hennessey-1,Don't expect the book,5,14 December 2006,"If you have read the book and expect the movie to be anywhere near as good you will be disappointed. It's mostly the same characters but the story line in some places is completely different. Katrina is left out, Roran leaves in the first 10mins - so he won't have to join the army (which Horst's boys have to do in the first 5mins). The story line also takes sections of the book and distorts them so other sections are completely wiped out eg, Brom saves Eragon when he saves Arya and then Brom dies in Aryas arms - which means that Arya is awake almost the entire time and Eragon never goes into her mind, they also never fully explain the appearance of Murtagh - and make him completely willing to go to the Vardan. These are just some of the points that irked me. If i had gone in not thinking it would be related to the book at all I might have had a different opinion, but i just loved the book so much.",Eragon
