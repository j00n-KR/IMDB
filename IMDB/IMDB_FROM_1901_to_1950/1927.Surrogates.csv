0,TheLittleSongbird,"Very intriguing, while it's less than perfect the good far outweighs the not-so-good",7,20 April 2015,"Surrogates' great and very interesting concept and the amount of talent on display were its selling points, and Surrogates on the whole delivers, its good parts being pretty great actually. Of course it's less than perfect, but none of the not-so-good things come over disastrously, more unevenly if anything else.The film is a very good-looking one, the sci-fi/technological look very handsomely rendered and imaginatively surreal. It's also beautifully shot and crisply edited and there are some good special effects on display. That is not to say that all the special effects are great, some of them looking rather cheap and being more at home in a film from the late 80s-early 90s. The music has its bombastic, pulsating moments as well as a hauntingly understated quality. Some of the script is interesting and probes a lot of thought, but other parts are on the weak side, with some very clichéd dialogue and it doesn't develop its characters as well as it could have done. James Cromwell's character especially is very underutilised and shallow.From a story point of view, most of it works. There are some good ideas and subplots that are in a good amount if not all cases explored intelligently and intriguingly but what was really remarkable was the subplot with Greer and Maggie's failing relationship, which brought an emotional core that really resonated with me. It's not completely successful, some of it does plod, especially the conspiracy elements, and much more could have been done with the ending, which felt underdeveloped and confused. The action's a mixed bag, some are energetic and exciting but others are pedestrian and on the silly side. Surrogates is directed efficiently and the cast do a great job, though James Cromwell has been much better and more engaged in other roles.Particularly impressive were a charismatically world-weary and no-nonsense Bruce Willis and Rosamund Pike's excellent, sympathetic performance ranks among her better roles. Radha Mitchell is also touching. Overall, has some uneven moments but a most intriguing film that delivers on most levels. 7/10 Bethany Cox",Surrogates
1,Leofwine_draca,Generally decent thriller is a bit underrated,6,3 January 2017,"I'm a sucker for Bruce Willis movies. I also admit that I'm a fan of director Jonathan Mostow; his movies, such as TERMINATOR 3, might not be favourites, but he always seems to know how to deliver intense thrills and decent action. When I saw the two were combining for this science fiction thriller which looked a lot like I, ROBOT, I was delighted. What guy doesn't like robots and the intriguing possibilities they pose in film? Thankfully, the movie is a darned sight better than that idiotic Will Smith outing, but it's true to say that it's no classic. The main problem with SURROGATES is the uneasy combination of a thinking man's plot with the necessity to appeal to 13 year old boys. Thus, we get a thought-provoking, half-baked plot about mankind's reliance on artificial help and the increasing agoraphobia faced by the laptop generation combined with some fairly run-of-the-mill thrills and spills of a typical thriller. This is an incredibly short film, and neither the plot nor the action are developed very much.That's not to say it's not entertaining – because it is. Bruce Willis is reliable in an emotional turn, and he gets fine support from Rosamund Pike, Radha Mitchell, and Boris Kodjoe, with minor turns from the imposing Ving Rhames and the impossibly ancient James Cromwell. The film LOOKS good, thanks to Mostow and director of photography Oliver Wood, who's been creating fine-looking films ever since DIE HARD 2 (his Bourne trilogy being a standout). The film has a heart-string tugging central relationship all about loss, grief, and love which gives it an extra dimension over many a lunkheaded shooter.There are elements of I, ROBOT and THE MATRIX in the storyline, but the themes behind the thrills are far more interesting than the face-value plot. I also loved the creepy look of the surrogates themselves; they seemed to me to be a natural progression of the plastic surgery craze that's been accepted in Hollywood for too many years. Okay, this isn't a great film, but the well-crafted action and strong central performance make it more than watchable.",Surrogates
2,SnoopyStyle,Robotic acting in fascinating premise,6,4 November 2014,"In the near future, people use robotic surrogates in place of their everyday life. It started 14 years previously with the work of Dr. Lionel Canter (James Cromwell). Now there is a resistance to their use led by The Prophet (Ving Rhames). Crime has been all but eliminated when the world is full of surrogates. Then people actually gets killed when their surrogates get blasted by a new weapon. FBI agents Greer (Bruce Willis) and Peters (Radha Mitchell) investigate. He's married to Maggie (Rosamund Pike). He wants to take a vacation out in the real world as themselves but she rather use the surrogates since the lost of their son. One of the victims is the son of Canter who had been forced out of his company VSI 7 years ago and is now a recluse. They uncover a vast conspiracy.The movie creates a fascinating world. It's filled with intriguing ideas. I like where this movie is coming from. I do wonder if the movie is better with society stratified between the poor who live in their real bodies and the rich in their surrogates. Instead it's made out to be a choice depending on your viewpoint. The bigger issue is the robotic acting because ... they're robots. There is something disconnected about the unblinking robots. It does allow for some great action but it mostly leaves me cold. As for the ending, I expect something much more action oriented.",Surrogates
3,claudio_carvalho,Flawed but Entertaining,7,13 February 2010,"In a near future, with the development of the robotic, mankind stays at home operating surrogates with their signature to live their lives in the outside world and resolving issues like racism, complex and safety and reducing crime rates. Only a few people live in reservations the traditional way of life without the use of substitutes. When the surrogates of a man and a woman are destroyed by a sophisticated weapon, the FBI agents Tom Greer (Bruce Willis) and Peters (Radha Mitchell) are assigned to the case and sooner they discover that the operators have also died. Tom Greer goes further in his investigation and finds that there is a conspiracy involving the army, the company VSI that manufactures the androids, the FBI, The Prophet (Ving Rhames) leader of the humans and the scientist that had developed the surrogate technology Canter (James Cromwell). ""Surrogates"" is a flawed but entertaining feature with an interesting concept but many plot holes. If the viewer does not think about the story, he or she will certainly enjoy a lot. But the screenplay does not explain many points, like for example, how could people live sitting on a chair without any sort of exercise have a safer and healthier life? Why Canter had not dedicated to destroy the surrogates only without harming the humans disconnecting them first? Why Peters did not get the access code by herself? What has happened with the humans when they discover that The Prophet was a machine? There are many other flaws but in the end I am a fan of Bruce Willis and Radha Mitchell and I found this movie is a good entertainment. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): ""Substitutos"" (""Substitutes"")",Surrogates
4,classicsoncall,"""We just saved about a billion lives there!""",7,26 December 2018,"When I first started watching the movie, I thought hmm, here's an interesting and creative concept. But then the more I thought about it, I said to myself, why would ANYONE want a surrogate of their own? Sit around at home all day and live vicariously through a robot that might or might not look like you? That seemed like just an awful waste of time with no productive value to it. So in that respect, the anarchists led by The Prophet (Ving Rhames) were actually the ones who had it right. I like Bruce Willis and Rosamund Pike, and they did OK here, but the way the surrogates looked was kind of creepy, especially the one of Greer (Willis). You see Willis as a surrogate before you really know what's going on and it causes a huh? moment if you're engaged in the story; his plasticene face just doesn't look right. Not knowing where the story was going, I thought it was a good thing when it eventually turned on the idea that the surrogate population needed to be deactivated. The scene when it actually happened was kind of stunning, it made you think about all the 'REAL' people back at home wondering what the heck happened. They might actually have to get up and go outside for a change.",Surrogates
5,jboothmillard,Surrogates,6,13 October 2009,"From director Jonathan Mostow (Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines), the sound of the concept and the leading action star I think was enough to draw me in. Set in a not-too-distant looking future, people are living within the safety of their homes, because every single person has their own robotic surrogate, perfect looking machines controlled by the original body's mind to go through their everyday routines, e.g. work, shopping, etc. Because of this new way of ""living"", crime, pain, fear and consequences don't exist, that is until Agent Tom Greer (Bruce Willis) finds a murder case to solve. It involves the son of the father of surrogates, Old Canter (James Cromwell), and it is up to Greer and partner Agent Peters (Radha Mitchell) to find the killer and get to the bottom of a conspiracy. Greer is also trying to deal with his wife Maggie (Die Another Day's Rosamund Pike), who refuses to let go of her surrogate during their tough marriage, and after the death of their son. When you do eventually find out how the killings of surrogates, crossing to the controllers, are happening, and who is responsible, you are surprised, but the film is resolved in the end, what happens to the surrogates is quite interesting too. Also starring Boris Kodjoe as Stone, James Francis Ginty as Canter, Ving Rhames as The Prophet, Michael Cudlitz as Colonel Brendon and Jack Noseworthy as Strickland. Willis, even as a surrogate with an obvious wig, is good at being the hard man, with a good supporting cast, for this imaginative, question posing and special effects ladened science-fiction action thriller. Bruce Willis was number 35 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars. Good!",Surrogates
6,moonspinner55,"""Surrogacy is an addiction...and you have to kill the addict to kill the addiction!""",2,20 August 2015,"Expensive but dull, sterile sci-fi adaptation of the graphic novels by Robert Venditti and Brett Weldele concerns remote-controlled androids of the future, developed to obliterate crime in society, that are mysteriously being 'murdered'. These incidents, however baffling, should not being causing harm to the very-human ""surrogate"" owners, but is resulting in their deaths as well. Two FBI agents smell a rat, particularly when one of the dead units is discovered to belong to the son of the reclusive doctor responsible for inventing surrogates. Top-heavy with gadgetry, this lumbering thriller seems plastic and embalmed...what can you say about a movie so humorless that it adds in a belching technician just to rouse its audience? Bruce Willis, as both the head Fed and his lookalike surrogate (with a blond weave!), looks exhausted. Mechanically directed by Jonathan Mostow, who paces the conversational scenes like episodes from a TV detective series. Anything but entertaining. * from ****",Surrogates
7,hitchcockthelegend,Surrogacy is a perversion. It's an addiction. And you have to kill the addict to kill the addiction.,7,31 January 2014,"I first viewed Surrogates upon its home format release and positively found it very ordinary. Viewing it again, with focus and in solitude, it proved to be a far better experience.The action scenes are what you would expect for a multi-plex appeasing popcorner, loud, colourful and owing great debt to modern technology. Yet to dismiss this totally as one of those easy money making blockbuster movies is most unfair.Surrogates oozes intrigue, even if it doesn't quite deliver on the smartness written on the page. The idea that in the future robotic alter egos can carry out our everyday mundane functions is cracker-jack, and it opens up a whole can of berserker worms. This is not merely an excuse to have Bruce Willis running around exploding surrogate robots, as much fun as that is of course, there's a deeper emotional core pulsing away as Willis fights the good fight to make sure being human is not cast aside like a thing of the past, that as flawed as we are, hiding away in a surrogate is not the answer.This axis of the story is beautifully realised by the plot strand involving Willis and Rosamund Pike as his wife, with both actors doing fine work to give it the required emotional heft. It may ultimately lose itself to a standard conspiracy plot, but there's intelligence within to make Surrogates a better film than it first appears. 7/10",Surrogates
8,Scarecrow-88,Surrogates,6,3 August 2010,"In the future, we will remain in our bedrooms, locked into a mind machine, living through ""surrogates"", robotic replicas(except they are designed at the specifications of those in charge). A surrogate is destroyed which, somehow mysteriously, kills the operator..the son of the famous mastermind behind the creation of the surrogates, excommunicated from the company he helped build, VSI, Cantor(James Cromwell). FBI agents Greer and Peters(Bruce Willis and Radha Mitchell)are on the case which soon includes their boss, Stone(Boris Kodjoe), Cantor, a leader over a human movement known as The Prophet(Ving Rhames)and a hired assassin, Strickland(Jack Noseworthy). It all involves a decision by Cantor regarding the surrogates and it didn't exactly go over too well for his old company, VSI. There's a weapon which sends furious electrical charges into the eyes of the surrogates and, in turn, murders the human who operates it. Strickland had it(given to him by who?)and it soon passes into the hands of The Prophet and his followers. Greer's surrogate is killed and he decides to continue his investigation without the use of another which is more than a bit difficult as he lands right in the middle of a war between Cantor and VSI. Someone ""comandeers"" Peters which could endanger not just the population of surrogates in existence, but of the human race as well.Big budget sci-fi, with a plot that isn't as complex as you might be led to believe, over in only 85 minutes with a heavy emphasis on action and especially special effects. There are two major action sequences: (a) the surrogate Greer chasing after Strickland in the forbidden human zone(humans who refuse to use surrogates are referred to as ""dreads"")and (b) Greer trying to stop the surrogate Peters from running off with classified information(the new operator in charge of Peters' surrogate also has plans to invade the VSI central network, a type of epicenter where a human is in charge of keeping an eye out for any criminal activity involving the robots by their masters)which could cause harm to the human race. We see what the surrogates look in various forms(the robotic metallic faces and underlying mechanized body hidden behind synthetic flesh, appearing to us when surrogates are damaged)and what they are capable of(how they can fly and speedily move, not to mention their power). The weapon which ""discontinues"" surrogates is like a souped-up taser gun. The film uses the surrogates plot as a means to expose our heavy dependency for technology and how it is dehumanizing us as a society. Particularly, SURROGATES uses the melodrama of Greer and his wife Maggie(Rosamund Pike)in to punch this story home, how a tragic car accident which resulted in their loss of a child(which also facially scarred Maggie)has tore the marriage apart. Mags isn't keen on surrendering her reliance on a beautiful surrogate which is a direct opposite of her human form..that's a recurring theme, actually, many humans use a surrogate which is designed by how they wish they could perceive themselves. Willis' Greer wants what Cantor does, for humans to abandon their surrogates and begin to ""live"" again. I personally thought the surrogates were creepy, soulless like mannequins, except they walk and talk and seem human..kudos to the cast for selling this in their performances, acting like robots can not be easy.",Surrogates
9,Hey_Sweden,"Well-intentioned, if unmemorable, sci-fi action picture.",7,16 January 2016,"In this world of the future, technology now allows people to experience life vicariously through the activities of their ""surrogates"", which are ultra sophisticated robotic creations. Trouble brews when the son of the programs' creator is killed. Bruce Willis plays Greer, an FBI agent forced to leave his home for the first time in years in order to solve the conspiracy.An adaptation of the graphic novel by Robert Venditti & Brett Weldele, ""Surrogates"" is slick genre entertainment, a cut above many films of this type due to some genuinely provocative content. It certainly may make each viewer ponder the idea of having what is essentially a robot live their life for them. A parallel between the obsessions of this films' characters and real life addictions to technology can certainly be seen. In the end, the need to stress, and reclaim, our humanity is made clear. The action scenes are capably handled, but there are not that many of them. This is one of those instances where the action is serving the story and not vice versa. The visual and makeup effects are generally well done.Credit is due to these filmmakers - led by director Jonathan Mostow - for hitting the ground running and keeping their pace rather lively. Refreshingly, ""Surrogates"" runs a trim hour and a half, so there's no uninteresting filler to have to sit through. There is some poignancy to the material, as Greer desperately tries to reconnect with his wife Maggie (Rosamund Pike), who fixates on her surrogate, partly as a way of dealing with grief.Willis gives a sensitive, appealing performance in the lead, although it may be distracting seeing that wig on the head of his surrogate. Lovely ladies Radha Mitchell and Pike are fine, as is Boris Kodjoe as the FBI supervisor. James Cromwell and Ving Rhames are kind of wasted in their respective supporting roles, but it's fun to see Jack Noseworthy (a semi regular in Mostows' filmography), Devin Ratray (Buzz from ""Home Alone""), and Michael Cudlitz (Abraham on 'The Walking Dead') turn up.Reasonably stimulating and diverting for 89 robust minutes.Seven out of 10.",Surrogates
10,dbborroughs,Solid scifi tale is a kind of throw back to the pulp scifi and mystery stories of the 1930's and 40's.,8,21 October 2009,"In a world where most people live their lives via robotic surrogates who take on the appearance of anything they want, someone has managed to create a means of destroying the surrogates, and their remote operators. Police officer Bruce Willis is put on the case and some people are not happy where the chase leads.Cinematic equivalent of an old pulp magazine scifi short story pumped up to feature length motion picture with an A list cast. This is the sort of story that was the basis of stories on old radio shows like X Minus One or Dimension X. Welded to the scifi story is a noir-ish mystery that could very well have come from the pen of some one like Raymond Chandler. It's a small scale story that is perhaps just a bit too neat in its solution but is still highly entertaining.I know some people who really disliked this film. They dislike that there are only a couple of big action scenes and a lot of talk. They don't like that the film has more on its mind then just action They didn't like it's the things that make this very much a throw back to a much simpler time, nor do they like that this isn't a rip off of a rip off (its not a robots run amok tale).I, on the other hand, really liked it. I liked that the film has characters with motivation and back story. I like the lack of big explosions and constant action. I liked that the film has more on its mind then just death and destruction. This is film with ideas in its head, it wants to know what is it that makes us human; and it ponders how technology is making us less in touch. It's a wonderful change of pace.I freely admit that it isn't perfect. It's a bit too neat story wise, and the street scenes are a bit too much the same, but at the same time it's a really good movie.I recommend it for anyone wanting a good mystery with healthy dose mixed in, or for anyone wanting a scifi story that isn't just a shoot 'em up.",Surrogates
11,zardoz-13,Great Premise But Inferior Execution,6,26 September 2009,"""Terminator 3"" director Jonathan Mostow must have seemed like the perfect choice for the Bruce Willis science fiction crime thriller ""Surrogates,"" about life-like robots serving as the arms and legs of future society. ""Terminator: Salvation"" scenarists John Brancato and Michael Ferris adapted the five-issue, limited series, Top Shelf Comics graphic novel ""The Surrogates"" that Robert Venditti wrote and Brett Weldele illustrated. Naturally, Mostow and his writers wound up making some inevitable changes. Nevertheless, the premise of ""Surrogates"" has lost none of its intrigue. Venditti told ""The Graphic Novel Reporter"" magazine about the origins of ""Surrogates"": ""It dawned on me that if you were somehow able to create a persona and send it out into the real world—where it could go to work for you, and run your errands, and so on—then you would never have to go back to being yourself."" Consequently, the agoraphobic society of ""Surrogates"" confines themselves to interacting vicariously with each other through surrogate androids. Often, these humanoid robots are younger and sexier than their operators. Sometimes, a man masquerades as a female android and Caucasian Americans pose as African-Americans. After the first 45 minutes, however, this futuristic, Philip K. Dick style saga about the changes that surrogates have wrought on mankind degenerates into a predictable FBI procedural that loses its urgency. Ultimately, Bruce Willis must forsake the flawed justice system, turn into a rogue cop, and defeat corruption at the highest levels. Were this not enough, Brancato and Ferris insert a subplot about our hero's son who died tragically in a car accident and his persistent struggle to pull his wife out of the depression that she suffers as a result of their son's death. Little of this scenario, however, turns out to be thrilling. The villains aren't intimidating enough, and the heroes simply aren't that heroic. Some of the action is interesting, but there is absolutely nothing in the way of suspense until our hero has to venture into the cold, cruel world without a surrogate and even then nothing exciting happens. ""Surrogates"" opens with a prologue that covers the origins of these androids and how they became an everyday fact of life. Mostow and his writers do an admirable job of setting up the premise so it seems believable. The year is 2017. Everybody plugs into a life-sized surrogate and conducts their daily business with the use of these robots. Few people leave their houses. The crime rate plunges. Surrogates are less prone to injury. They can leap over cars to avoid being struck by other vehicles. Finally they are immune to STDs. Imagine living like you were in ""The Matrix,"" where you spend most of your waking hours sprawled on a couch, with sensory headgear attached to your noggin that enables you to carry on your daily activities through a surrogate robot. Indeed, you cannot walk down the street without seeing surrogates everywhere, and few people own surrogates that don't add glamor to their appearance. Government Agents Tom Greer (Bruce Willis of ""Die Hard"") and Jennifer Peters (Radha Mitchell of ""Melinda and Melinda"") work in the FBI's Surrogate Crime Unit. When two surrogates and their human operators are murdered under mysterious circumstances, Special Agent Andrew Stone (Boris Kodjoe) assigns Greer and Peters to investigate what constitutes the first murder in many moons. Somebody has obtained a deadly weapon that fires a jagged blue lightning bolt at a surrogate and kills the operator with the same blast. Later, the killer wipes out five Boston cops on his heels. As it turns out, one of the initial homicide victims was the son of Canter (James Cromwell of ""L.A. Confidential""), who invented surrogates for the VSI Corporation. In the beginning, Cantor felt that surrogates would make life easier for people with handicaps who could not get out. As it turns out, the villains were trying to kill Cantor, not his son. Nevertheless, the elder Canter had loaned his surrogate to his university age son (James Francis Ginty of ""K-19 Widowmaker"") who had planned a night out on the town when the murderer struck. Greer starting snooping and learns that the weapon used to kill Canter's son had been tested by the Pentagon. The military canceled their order when they discovered the lethal side effects of the weapon. Basically, the weapon transmits a virus to the humanoid machines, enters their operator's head and liquefied their brains.Mostow and his writers have divided ""Surrogates"" into two movies: the surrogate homicide investigation and Greer's tragic personal home life. The situation hits the fan when the FBI track down a suspect, Strickland (Jack Noseworthy of ""Breakdown""), who has the weapon. Strickland flees from the Boston Police while Greer follows him overhead in an FBI chopper. Certain areas are off limits to surrogates and humans who refuse to use surrogates live in those areas. Strickland heads to a zone where surrogates are not allowed to enter. Greer's helicopter crashes in one of these areas and the humans attack Greer, obliterate him, and hang him in effigy. Now, Greer has to venture out into society as himself without a surrogate and he finds it difficult to negotiate a world overrun by robots. Unfortunately, ""Surrogates"" runs out of steam, and the ending is as contrived as they come. This may be the first film to espouse a negative attitude toward futuristic technology that intrudes into our lives. The villains fail to make an impression. Brancato and Ferris spring some surprises, but none are truly alarming. The scene near the end where all the people fall down in the streets was probably a hassle to stage. ""Surrogates"" is imaginative but rarely exciting thriller. The idea that technology will exact a toll of our humanity and its ramifications is more interesting than it hopped up action scenes. Bruce Willis can do better than this nonsense. ""Gamer"" was far better than this lame whodunit.",Surrogates
12,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,The irony is how superficial and far from actual reality this film is,6,11 October 2009,"I have not read the graphic novel, though I can imagine doing so; I am almost certain that it is more complex and smarter than this adaptation. Let's start with all the wasted potential. Maybe recently watching Traffic and The Kingdom heightened(temporarily, perhaps?) the level of what I consider to be food for thought, and a delivery of such that does not talk down to the viewer. This immediately and consistently sacrifices almost all opportunities for subtlety, and instead hammers home the couple of half-hearted points that Mostow could get out of the brilliant concept. Why is money continually thrown at him? Is it in attempt at practical application of the ""1000 monkeys at a 1000 type-writers"" theory? Has he made a single compelling flick? I haven't watched U-571, but is it really so excellent that it makes up for T3 and this? Yes, OK, we get it, Surrogates = not people, not human, stop visually beating us over the head with that. The idea is oversimplified, and the majority of the conclusions are wildly inaccurate, going against our nature. Crime dropping almost entirely? Why? Did the invention create a ton of new jobs, thus eliminating unemployment, and was the issue of our immense individuality and wide-spread abandonment of traditional life-styles, forcing everyone to determine their own identity, with countless of choices available, somehow, I don't know, ""fixed""? Racism and sexism ceasing to exist? ...now I know you're joking. Surely you must be(how would that even happen as a result of...?). Why does no one in this express lacking the feeling of fulfillment and self-realization? Neither can be ""true"" if life is not lived directly, so to speak, and it seems quite obvious that life without risk is not going to make anyone happy for a moment once the novelty wears off. It's an ""easy solution"", and those don't work out in the long run, and that would have been marvelous to go into that herein. I can enjoy a silly movie. Not everything has to change and revolutionize the medium. However, I am not going to ignore this overreaching tripe. Jonathan, if you cannot direct something terribly intelligent, then please admit that to yourself, and stop pursuing them. This doesn't equal the action of Terminator 3, either... with the exception of one brief bit of it, it was not exciting, and it definitely does not go anywhere near as far as it could(come on, robots that can leap and have immense strength? Think of additional things for them to do with it, then), and frankly comes off as uninspired. In general, this is kind of unengaging. I think the fact that characterization and development is close to non-existent has a lot to do with it. Really, there are maybe two roles that have personality, and one you definitely can't get behind. I guess JM was terrified we'd take the side of anyone other than who we are supposed to. There are a handful of scenes that resonate with the audience. I'm not joking, the theater was half-full, and there was little response, and not all of our reactions where the intended ones, either... the humor tried too hard and was dumb, and at least one part was comical, the opposite of what it was meant to. Anyway, one or two dramatic bits were relatively convincing. The ""fake look"" on the Surri's was perfect, that was one area where they did not go overboard. Apart from the casting of Rhames, that aspect was good. And the acting was solid, including, I believe, Cody Christian, a kid, who *utterly* sold his performance. Willis is, of course, great. This holds some disturbing content, a little mild language, sexuality and violence. I recommend this to... heck, I don't know. The biggest fans of those involved, I guess. 6/10",Surrogates

My only question for him and the movie is why Willis, who could pick any surrogate he wanted to represent himself in the outside world, would pick one with such a bad hairstyle? This film doesn't amount to much, but it does make an interesting companion piece with recent films like ""Wall-E"" that explore the extent to which people hide behind their technology as a way to avoid having to interact with the real world around them. I look around at people riding public transportation with me, each plugged into his or her own little private world, and think there may just be something to this film's warning, however disposable the film itself may be.Grade: B-",Surrogates
16,ferguson-6,Missed the Boat,5,27 September 2009,"Greetings again from the darkness. This Sci-Fi thriller with a good premise just comes across as underdeveloped. Can't really blame director Jonathan Mostow (Terminator 3, U-571) as he delivers some pretty good visuals and nice overall look of the film. What I don't get is how such advanced physical robots could be developed, yet artificial intelligence is present at all.Bruce Willis is supposed to bring the human side to the film through his suffering (loss of child), longing (depressed wife) and anger (beating the crap out of a surrogate who continues laughing at him). Somehow we feel no connection to this poor guy all on his own in the cold, cruel world. Could it be that we have basically seen all of this before? A suspended cop going renegade to save the day by solving the crime ... what a novel idea! On the bright side, brilliant casting have Radha Mitchell and Rosamund Pike as key surrogate characters. Since both show the range of a robot in most of their films, this couldn't have been too difficult for them. The make-up on surrogates was very good - creating a mannequin look, even for Willis. Throw in James Cromwell as the twisted mastermind bent on revenge and redemption, and what you have is a pretty basic story wrapped around an under-developed premise of surrogate robots.Some similarities to WestWorld; I, Robot; and The Matrix, this one falls short.",Surrogates
17,HotToastyRag,Exciting futuristic movie,8,2 July 2019,"The beginning of Surrogates shows everyone young and beautiful, as if they've been airbrushed by the best filters in Hollywood. They have! After the first scene, we see what people really look like; the futuristic world is lived by ""surrogate"" bodies controlled by sedentary humans at home. So, since you can choose to look any way you want to but in reality can be a completely different body type, race, or gender, the movie tells the audience not to trust anyone. It's very interesting, and exciting too!In this lovely new future, there's a universal decrease in violence and murder, since people don't die or get hurt if their surrogate gets killed or hurt. However, someone does get killed, and police officer Bruce Willis has to save the day. And he has to save it without the safety of his surrogate! He teams up with beautiful surrogate Radha Mitchell, and they investigate everything and everyone, including Ving Rhames, a renowned spiritual guru, and the inventor of the surrogate lifestyle, James Cromwell. Of course it's James Cromwell-he's always the inventor in futuristic movies! Bruce also has a sadness in his past that affects his relationship with his wife, Rosamund Pike; because saving the human race isn't enough of a struggle for him in a two-hour movie.Rent this exciting adventure with your friends the next time you're planning movie night. I own a copy and have seen it three or four times already. It's very exciting and will keep you at the edge of your seat with the twists and turns. Since I'm very picky about my futuristic movies, my recommendation holds a lot of weight!",Surrogates
18,FlashCallahan,Upload complete.....,6,7 December 2013,"Surrogates are created so that humans can link up, and go out into the world without having to deal with the dangers of everyday life. There's a movement led by 'The Prophet', who believes that Surrogates are an abomination. When a surrogate is attacked by one of his members, the human controlling it is also killed which is unheard of. FBI agents Greer and Peters investigate and they learn that it is the son of the surrogate creator who was killed. When the attacker is found, Greer ends up in a ""No Surrogates"" zone and is attacked and his surrogate is destroyed. Greer then goes out into the world in non surrogate form, for the first time in years....The thing about this film is, that it has some marvellous ideas, some great narrative, but its a film that looks and feels like its been cut and edited within an inch of its life, and we are just left with a generic Sci-Fi movie.Somewhere there is a longer cut that fills in plot holes, fleshes out characters (especially the relationship between Willis and Pike) and makes it altogether a more satisfying experience.For now though, we have to settle for this generic, but entertaining movie about change and coping with loss, but with the added bonus of an Airbrushed Bruce Willis with a Blonde wig.Not bad, just average.",Surrogates
19,DICK STEEL,A Nutshell Review: Surrogates,6,1 October 2009,"What happens if your leading man is wrinkled and balding? Well, in the film world, the rage these days is to be able to do decades worth of flashbacks, or alternative fantasies using your mature actor, with computer graphics providing that painless, silkily smooth and flawless skin, complete with luscious and bouncy hair. Bruce Willis being in his prime, well, that indeed is a draw for the film Surrogates.Like Gerard Butler's Gamer, Surrogates deal with the rapid advancement of technology, where robotic avatars providing that intermediate buffer between the actual person, and the world they inhabit. But this is not a virtual world, but the real one in which we live in, where we own robots which we can control while semi-conscious and plugged in, and needs battery recharging at the end of the day. Carpe diem becomes possible because risk taking is borne by this metallic shell, though we share in all its sensory pleasures.This of course makes the field rich for some philosophical ploughing, where one can debate about our rising dependency on technology, preferring virtual interaction and experience over the real thing. The seeds are already sown as you tell from our preference to hide behind handles in online chatrooms, get updates from friends over Facebook profiles versus even interacting over the phone, and the list goes on. We're dealing with the tussle between addiction and the need to unplug ourselves from this mass online grid, lest we slowly lose our humanity.Or at least that's what science fiction tales like these like to preach about, with proponents of the Surrogate system worried that a recent glitch resulting in the death of their human controllers would spiral mass panic and a system integrity meltdown, and opponents of the system who are more for pro-human activity over playing god and living a life with induced experiences. However, the under 90 minute runtime, which was somewhat of a surprise to me, only allowed very cursory suggestions of such themes about man's obsession to create the perfect society, and our growing technological reliance.That proved to be a weakness in the story, as it had ideas that weren't allowed to be properly developed, resulting in some rather scatter-brained subplots that were thrown around without much resolution. For example, there was one with Ving Rhames as The Prophet leading the human resistance, but it became somewhat of an intentional farce in wanting to warn about false prophets in religions. Abuse is another frequently used development especially when power lies with authority and legitimacy is questioned.Director Jonathan Mastow can't seem to steer himself away from robots. His previous film was T3, and here metallic robots with superhuman abilities lie under the synthetic human flesh. All the actors went through robotic acting class to deliberately behave like one, so as to make it easy to tell if they're in their surrogates (beside looking young and extremely attractive) through their very unnatural, rigid acting. This emotionless look might be somewhat of a turn off, besides some very cheap looking computer graphics for a major set action piece (I suspect through the lack of budget in this aspect).The main narrative follows Bruce Willis' cop Tom Greer who has to unravel a murder mystery, while at the same time in wanting to add some emotional impact to his dogged looking character, gets faced with some matrimonial issues with his spouse, played by Rosamund Pike. As I already mentioned, the film had tried to cram too much in too little time, resulting in a rushed job that would have been better received should it have a little more focus. Not to say that it was as bad or worse than Gamer, but it could have delivered a more focused story.",Surrogates
20,siderite,I Robot-y kind of movie. Willis saves the world again.,7,7 November 2009,"A movie that looks like I Robot, with less effects, the same central switch-for-everything solution, even has James Cromwell play the father of all magic technology. The only difference is that robots are not autonomous, but driven from people jacking from home (pun unintended) and that Bruce Willis plays the main role.Being completely predictable doesn't mean that it was a bad movie, more to the point, it was exactly what people would want. A good performance from Willis, a very low involvement of any other actor, including Radha Mitchell, Ving Rhames or James Cromwell, and a feeling of deja vu that cannot have been a coincidence. So, by that standard, I am calling it a sequel to I Robot. Oh, and Willis saves the world again, just as impossibly as he usually does.Bottom line: anything that is average and is written by John Brancato has to be a feat for the guy, so thumbs up. Other than that it was a decent sci-fi movie, strangely reminiscent of I Robot.",Surrogates
21,Smells_Like_Cheese,"Robot bad, tree pretty... when will we ever learn?",5,19 September 2010,"An idea that has been used multiple times, machines take over, the scientists play God and the world is in a state of panic. Back in 2004 there was a movie released called ""I, Robot"" starring Will Smith, basically being about how robots have taken over and now do our jobs. Well, Surrogates takes this idea only with a twist and a clever premise, what if we had a twin robot? One that could do our job, go out, run errands and basically saving us from having to deal with the outside world of crime and disease. Not to mention that you could make your surrogate look however you want it to look, something completely different, opposite sex or different age, race or just a more beautiful version of you. Sounds like Heaven, right? But when you come down to the ethics of it, makes you question if this is a healthy lifestyle while we remain shut-in's and completely locked from the outside world. No exercise or physical contact can drive you crazy. Surrogates has a lot of potential in the story, but was poorly executed. Going from a very clever story to a bad action movie, not to mention some of the plot holes, Bruce Willis tries his best to make this story work. Unfortunately the movie just wasn't handled the right way.In the future, use of remotely-controlled androids called ""surrogates"" allows everyone to live in idealized forms in the safety of their own homes. A surrogate's operator is protected from harm and does not feel any pain when their surrogate is damaged. FBI agent Tom Greer and his partner, Agent Jennifer Peters, investigate the death of two people who were killed when their surrogates were destroyed. One of the victims is Jarod Canter, the son of Dr. Lionel Canter, the inventor of surrogates. Greer and Peters determine that a human, Miles Strickland, used a new type of weapon that overloaded the surrogate's systems and disabled the fail-safe mechanisms that shield an operator from harm; killing the operators. After locating Strickland, Greer attempts to bring him into custody. Greer is injured during the chase when Strickland uses the weapon again, and inadvertently crash-lands into an anti-surrogate zone. Greer's surrogate is eventually destroyed by a mob of humans, forcing him to interact in the world without one. Agent Greer learns that the weapon was produced, under a government contract, by the same company that produces the surrogates. It was designed to load a virus which would overload the surrogate's systems thus disabling it. The unexpected side effect was that the weapon disabled the fail-safe protocols that keep the surrogate's operator safe. Now going into the world in human form or also called a ""meat bag"", we start to find the severe flaws in this perfect world of surrogates.So sounds clever, right? Well, I couldn't find some of the concepts believable. Now from the looks of things, surrogates have been around for years, so I'm guessing it's to the point where none of the humans get out of their homes. Bruce Willis as a human gets our of his chair and walks perfectly as he goes into the public. Not to mention that his psyche must be pretty crazed as he hasn't been in public possibly since he was a child. The action sequences also didn't work for me, too cliché, to predictable and didn't blend well with the story. Chalk this one up to just the wrong director with a bad vision, because this movie could have been so much more. I love Bruce Willis but he wasn't right for the lead role. But I wouldn't say that this movie was a total loss, there are some good moments as well. I thought it had the story and I loved the villain of the story, someone who wanted the surrogates to help society, but instead are destroying not only the public but his family and personal life as well. Surrogates was a movie that I was happy just to watch on TV, it's just an OK film that I'll probably forget about in a few days.5/10",Surrogates
22,KineticSeoul,"Good, but could have been better",7,21 February 2010,"Well this was a pretty entertaining sci-fi flick with some message behind it. So the premise is that surrogates which are better looking versions of the operators walking on the planet in year 2017 while the real people isolate themselves while they think they are living the dream life controlling these robots. So in another words it's like a real life version of that one game ""Second Life"". But the story mostly revolves around a FBI agent Tom Greer(Bruce Willis) that is trying to investigate a destruction of a surrogate and the murder of the operator and it goes a bit more deep as Greer investigates. The twist was decent but it wasn't all that great or interesting and there really wasn't that big of a mystery behind it, but it was still fun from beginning to end. To sum it up it's a fast paced entertaining movie, but still sort of forgetful. Wouldn't really hurt to rent it.7.2/10",Surrogates
23,thesar-2,A.I.Robot.et.al,3,4 July 2010,"Wow. I didn't know what to expect from Surrogates. Literally, I watched it being a Bruce Willis fan, my desire to watch something new (to me) and my liking of Sci-Fi/Future Earth stories. Check, check and check. Unfortunately, as you should be careful for what you wish for, I forgot to ask for a great (or even really good) movie and/or something original.Obviously, these concepts portrayed aren't new; I, Robot, A.I., The Matrix, Minority Report, The Stepford Wives, The Terminator, anyone? That's just to name a few this 89-minute Twilight Zone episode mimicked, or borrowed from. I wouldn't have a problem with any of that if there were more substance or deeper levels to the characters. Literally everyone was reading the script verbatim. Including ""where can I cash this paycheck?"" Willis.I liked the intro: a recap of what happens in the near future – introduction to the A.I.'s or Surrogate technology, to the evolution of the evolved plastic human cyborg and then the ""present."" That was probably the cleverest thing about this film, but unfortunately, it follows that by just settling into the typical ""mystery"" of a murder when crime levels dipped to record lows. Tom (Willis) investigates a new weapon that can kill both the zombie cyborgs and the humans linked when this is UNHEARD OF ""Our products are guaranteed to not harm the human host when damage comes to the walking mannequin! Surely nothing can go wrong!"" (I honestly think its unnecessary to say somethingdoesgowrong!)If it's not clear yet, and not everything in this movie is, people now can truly be couch potatoes – my personal dream, if it weren't so hard to type lying down. They lay back, plug into this Matrix, or robots with skin, and they control the movements by the human host's brain. Without leaving the comfort of their bedroom, people now can run fast, lift tons, fight efficient wars andhere's the best partno longer will you be subjected to ugly people! You can now be a beautiful person on the outside, sorta.But now with this nasty and thoroughly expected (if you've seen just one Twilight Zone episode) weapon, the safety is off and Tom, who misses his dead son and the comfort of his vacant (into the machine) wife, has to journey into the reservations of actual humans to solve the murder of the surrogate's inventor's son.It tends to get really complicated, though thoroughly predictable, but it boils down to is this technology draining humans of being human? It's a no-brainer and even at a measly 89 minutes, it drags for what seems like hours.Yes, I'm aware humans due dumb things. But, it's really hard to buy this would take off. We all yearn to hear that whatever product or program has an ISO/BBB guarantee of working 100% and safe. This movie proves, far too many times, that this system has more than 1000 flaws.It's an interesting throw-back, but not groundbreaking. It does, however, contain some good shots and graphics, but overall it's a disappointment. You could watch any of the above mentioned movies for far better entertainment or heart. I'd say skip it, but it's so harmless, and short, it won't kill you to watch it from Netflix's ""watch instantly"" selections.Side Note: As noted, I'm a Bruce Willis fan and it was half 'n half fun/disappointing to see this movie ALSO copy Live Free or Die Hard. Replacing Kevin Smith is Devin Ratray and Willis must rely on/use technology to save the day. Only this time, he's a Rolex in the distant digital age.",Surrogates

25,Robert_duder,My anticipation may have been too much but this one didn't hit a high note,6,1 February 2010,"Bruce Willis happens to be one of my all time Hollywood heroes. Has he had some misses? Yes of course but I still love seeing him on screen and he's been sadly missing from the big screen really since the mind blowing Die Hard follow up in 2007. So when I first saw the trailers for Surrogates I was over the moon!! Sci-fi, action, Bruce Willis...it was a dream come true. Fifth Element, 12 Monkeys all over again. So needless to say I tell you all this to say I went in with some really huge expectations. I have never read or seen any of the graphic novels that the movie was based on, I didn't even know it was based on a graphic novel until after. Surrogates isn't totally off mark. It does have some really strong moments but when Bruce Willis is on screen you either have to give him something really emotional to sink his teeth into like The Sixth Sense or something less known In Country (great movie for him) or he has to be kicking some serious butt. And the problem is Surrogates doesn't truly hand him either of those things. The plot and the writing is downright weak while the concept is actually a really solid sci-fi concept.I've already touched on Willis but he headlines the cast and just looks really vapid, almost bored in the role. I mean I still love seeing the guy on the big screen but he just doesn't look like he's enjoying it. Granted his character is supposed to be mourning and sad and he definitely looks that part of it but it gets old quick. I still want to see him in big action roles!! Lesser known but terrific actor Radha Mitchell is Willis' partner who just seems to follow him through every hoop. She could also be a great kick butt action hero as proved in movies like Silent Hill but she isn't given a lot to work with so she falls even shorter than Willis. Rosamund Pike is lovely but the most vapid as Willis' wife who has sank into her surrogate for good and never wants to come out. Pike and Willis seem to have decent chemistry given the situation. Two great actors make small cameos that are unfortunately mostly useless to the entire story. James Cromwell and Ving Rhames play small roles that go completely unnoticed.The cast is simply not the issue in this film but rather the story created. The Surrogates that these people inhabit are seemingly mindless vapid symbols of their human counterparts and that means the actors play them that way and that isn't much fun to watch. I have to partially blame director Jonathan Mostow. He should know better. He has done solid action flicks with great stories like Breakdown, U571, and Terminator 3 (I don't care what anyone says I liked Terminator 3.) He should have recognized the holes in character creation in the script. Most of the blame has to go to screenwriters Michael Ferris and his long time writing partner John D. Brancato (Catwoman anyone?) Perhaps they're trying to create something great at the expense of the characters. The world is bleak and dangerous and haunting and its just unfortunate that it doesn't meet its potential. Still Surrogates is an okay thriller, with some okay action and its mostly mindless and won't stick with you very long. It's watchable and that is about the best you can get from it. I suppose for Bruce Willis fans like myself it will have to do until Cop Out in February which I am going into with slightly lower expectations...thank you Tracy Morgan. 6/10",Surrogates
26,wellthatswhatithinkanyway,Love it or hate it little action thriller,4,1 April 2010,"STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning Johnathan Mostow would seem to be that most sad of things called the one hit wonder. He delivered the sensational 1997 thriller Breakdown but all I can remember from him after that was historically inaccurate wartime bomb U-571 and the unnecessary Terminator 3. Now we have this curious little film that came and went at the box office which seems on about the same level.Bruce Willis plays another wise-cracking, burnt out cop called Greer in a futuristic, consumerist society where everyone has a 'surrogate' self that they present to the world in place of their real self, save for a small army of resistance fighters who live in their own little shanty huts. When the son of the inventor of surrogacy is killed, it sparks a mystery that leads to the top of the corporate hierachy.Surrogates offers little in the way of anything you haven't seen before and despite it's themes, little interesting food for thought on the ethics of science and consumerism. It might pass for some and has received one or two glowing reviews here and there. It's a surprisingly short film, and a harmless enough way to kill some time. But it didn't do much for me. **",Surrogates
27,bowmanblue,Competent little sci-fi number,7,3 June 2016,"Yeah, I know, Bruce Willis may be a bit past his sell-by date. He's hardly the box office draw he once was. And, yes, he does tend to exhibit a noticeable sneer/smirk throughout most of his most recent roles, but give him a chance here. He's not so bad.Surrogates set in the future when we all have robots to carry out our menial chores – all of apart from wise-cracking cop, played by Will Smith, who is hell-bent on proving that our robot 'protectors' are not what they seem. Oh, wait, that's not the plot for Surrogates at all – that's the plot for 'I Robot.' Never mind – just take out the word 'robots' and replace it with, er, 'surrogates' (which are basically robots) and you have the storyline.If you haven't seen I Robot, Surrogates may be quite original, but I couldn't believe how similar the two were. But I still enjoyed it. I put in my review title that it was a competent LITTLE sci-fi number. That's largely because it's quite short for a film – coming in well below the average hour and a half. And, because of this, it's over pretty quickly, almost like a TV episode of some sci-fi show.It has action, conspiracy, reasonably special effects and Bruce Willis isn't that annoying. In fact, his – how should I put this – 'mature' action hero status actually works here. The human race all have (surrogate) robots shaped like them who go out into the world under their human master's control. Naturally, everyone's surrogate is young and gorgeous while their human owner's body gets older and flabby from the comfort of their home. It's quite amusing when Bruce's beautiful bot gets beaten up and the 'real' human Bruce has to go out onto the streets with his bald head and wrinkles for all to see.All of this means that if you're a fan of the sci-fi genre you should get something out of this film. It's one of those films that you like more if you haven't had to pay for. If you can borrow it off a mate or find it as part of your online TV package, give it a go. It will definitely kill just over an hour of your time, but you probably wouldn't have wanted to pay full price in the cinema to see it. Oh, and it's also advisable not to watch I Robot before you see this (it's definitely superior – sorry, Bruce).",Surrogates
28,MLDinTN,the plot made some sense....,6,1 August 2010,"but still too many plot holes for me to really like it. I'm not that big a fan of sci-fi movies because usually there are too many plot holes. Such as does he even third world countries have surrogates? How do people procreate if they only go out in public as surrogates? Why do people stop committing crimes just because they use a surrogate? Bruce Willis plays detective Tom Greer whom is out to solve the countries first murder in quite some time. It seems now, every one uses a surrogate, meaning they use their mind to control a robot. The robots are made to be the most attractive looking version of yourself and can run, jump like a superhero. The guy murdered is the son of the inventor of surrogates, a man that was forced out of his own company years ago and is now a recluse. There are also sections of cities that are robot free, where humans don't want surrogates.It's up to Tom and his partner to figure out what new gadget killed the guy by killing his surrogate and what ties this to the inventor of surrogates.FINAL VERDICT: OK, worth seeing on cable.",Surrogates
29,Cineanalyst,In the Eyes of the Beholder,8,21 October 2020,"Sometimes I'm confounded by how others see movies. Take ""Surrogates,"" with its 37% RottenTomatoes score and criticisms of action-flick banality and stupid robot stuff. Indeed, the picture's introduction during the credits explaining the entire scenario as a political thriller was unnecessary and misguided, and if one accepts it on that level, it makes some sense that they'd be disappointed. What I enjoy about it, however, is that it's about spectatorship--about gazing upon movies. Characters see the world through virtual-reality headsets to identify with their robotic avatars much as we follow figures on the screen in dark movie theatres or alone in our bedrooms. Moreover, these robots are the actors' doubles just as film is but a representation of recorded people and not their actual presence. Initially, the only ""meatbag"" in the surrogates' world, as opposed to the reservations for the hold-outs who prefer living in their own skin, is the guy watching the surveillance monitors tracking the goings-on of the surrogates. He's our on-screen surrogate, even as we largely identify with and follow the protagonist played by Bruce Willis--especially when even our on-screen surrogate spectator, like us, is physically powerless to affect the proceedings. Even the noir-ish, detective mystery is over the murder of people through their eyes, and the love story is about the desire to see the woman inside and not the superficial shell she inhabits--in a way a repudiation of the so-called ""male gaze.""The acting isn't bad, either. There are quite a bit of little mannerisms added to suggest their second bodies' artificiality, along with the costume and production design. Willis and Rosamund Pike each have exceptionally expressive eyes. The visual effects have a hyper-realistic aspect to them that works well for the overall artificiality of the endeavor, and I even like the sense of weight when the surrogates land from leaping about. Sure, it's not perfect. Besides the opening credits, the implementation of Dutch angles seems rather haphazard. There doesn't seem to be much of anything to make of white characters possessing black-skinned surrogates, or of the transgendered potential of inhabiting any sex, and I think it's unfortunate that they have reservations for the humanity that is uprooted from their way of living, but the movie doesn't prominently cast any Native Americans. But, then again, viewing ""Surrogates"" as a reflection of reality I think is to miss seeing its fantastical potential as a sci-fi mediation between the screen and the spectator.",Surrogates

Things begin to get out of hand when a weapon is used that will not only kill the robot, but the human occupying it. What will happen? The acting is pretty good.

And oddly enough, it's perfect that these surrogates are more boring than the original people, the real humans locked in rooms for most of the movie.But this also means that the characters are boring. They're bland, they look plasticky, and they do ultra-normal things. Cause they ain't real. The only ""real"" people are renegades who reject a society made of surrogates, and these are rednecks, basically, with a weirdly uncharismatic leader, and they have only a passing role in the movie.And this means the movie is a little boring. The idea is not boring, but things proceed as if by script (surprise), and even Bruce Willis, the lead (in both real and surrogate form) is a bit ho-hum compared to, say, ""12 Monkeys."" There are echoes of lots of semi-futuristic movies here, like ""Minority Report,"" or ""Moon,"" and ""Surrogates"" just falls short and falls down in too many ways to really chill or thrill or intrigue.

Were only given glimpses of information throughout the film about The Surrogates. I was intrigued by the whole storyline, even fascinated by it, but it didn't give me the information I completely wanted. I was intrigued by the storyline of Greer|Willis| and Maggie|Pike|. But the movie is only 87 minutes or so long, and sadly decided to focus on less interesting things for me. I think it was much too short, and therefore it looks like a jumbled mess on many occasions. With a 2 hour time, I think this movie could have been much more then above average. I enjoy Bruce Willis. He's one of my favorites but if I have one complaint with him, he looks to be sleepwalking sometimes though his performances, and for the 1st half or so he definitely seems to be that way. The Surrogates in my opinion is confused on what it wants to be, and seems like a quick studio project for Willis.Performances. Bruce Willis can do this stuff in his sleep, and he knows that. He's charismatic as usual, but I felt he was going through the motions at times. He had a few really good moments, but they were few and far in between. Radha Mitchell is OK I suppose, but had a thinly written character. Rosamund Pike is beautiful, and did fine with her thinly written part. James Cromwell is pretty much wasted until the end, where he has a key part. Ving Rhames played a strange role, that didn't interest me.Bottom line. Surrogates was a harmless watch, and I suppose I enjoyed it to a certain extent, but it was a pretty lazy effort. Willis is capable of more.

34,tabuno,A Nice Hybrid of High Tech Action Thriller Movies,8,20 January 2019,"4 October 2009. SURROGATES presents a strong sci fi storyline that isn't so convoluted that it exhausts the viewer from mental analysis of what's going on. It also is crafted well so that unlike a number of sci fi action movies, the balance between the action and the human relationship components are in sync. This hybrid sci fi movie includes elements from I, ROBOT (2004) that introduced many of the similar robotic images, THE MATRIX (1999) that introduced the notion of virtual reality plug ins, ESCAPE FROM NEW YORK (1981) that introduced a post-modern society isolated from the rest of humanity, and FAHRENHEIT 451 (1966) that presented the dystopic future angst of a couple separated by technology. Bruce Willis continues at the top of his game in this movie bringing an even more subdued and sympathetic character to the screen. The action is compelling and strong, the technological premise of this movie is well executed, and the human/surrogate disconnect is remarkably engaging on an emotional level. Unfortunately, in somewhat of a less than powerful and poignant delivery, unlike FAHRENHEIT 451, SURROGATES ultimately has as its core the more traditional and perhaps predictable resolution and tidying up of lose ends favoring a more conservative and pedestrian movie overall.",Surrogates

The world that is created is a world where we live our lives connected into robots known as surrogates, which project us at our most physically beautiful. In fact it is one of those rare Hollywood movies were when we actually see a real human, we see them human warts and all, not the unrealistically beautiful actors and actresses that seem to dominate our minds.While this movie is set in either the future, or in an alternate reality, it really is a analogy of our world today, but not even just today, but almost every time in history. In a philosophical context (and yes while it is a sci-fi action film, much of the early science fiction that hit ourselves explored deep philosophical ideas) it is about the masks that we wear when we go out into society and interact with people. It is just that this film portrays these masks as robots that we control from our rooms. In fact nobody (with the exception of the dreds) ever actually leaves their homes. Occasionally we will see somebody who steps out from their surrogate, but they never (with the exception of Greer) actually leaves the home without it.We see this reflection in Greer's marriage as well with Greer pleading with his wife to come out of her surrogate and to speak to him in the flesh, but she constantly refuses to do so, despite Greer leaving his surrogate. In fact she is shocked that Greer is outside of his surrogate as well. We do see her, and she is addicted to her beauty, and the fact that she works in a beauty parlor, gives emphasis to this. It is the scene at the end of the movie when the camera focuses in on her limp surrogate lying on the floor of the parlor forcing her out of her rooms and into the arms of her husband.The creation of the mask, and remember when we interact with society we always wear our own masks, and even though we talk about removing them, we fear that people will look down on use because they can see us warts and all. This movie resonates with this idea because the mask is visual, and the truth of us is also visual. The surrogate allows us to be forever young, and that fear that we have of growing old, and growing ugly, is a real fear. It is not necessarily death that we fear, but that we will lose the beauty of our youth, and to lose that beauty is to become less of ourselves, and then there is the fear that people will judge us purely on our looks.Even when we provide feedback, there is always a fear of us being judged, and disliked, so we also put on a mask, but not on ourselves, but on the people that we are communicating with. In a way we are creating our own truths, and projecting that truth onto the world. It is not that relative truth is not a form of truth, because each of us has our own relative truth, it is just that when we refuse to acknowledge another form of relative truth that problems arise.As for the movie, leaving the philosophical aspects behind, it is still a great action sci-fi movie, exactly the type of movie that I love. In fact when I first saw it I thought that it was so out there that I actually thought that it must have been based on a Phillip K Dick novel. However, as it turns out, i",Surrogates
36,sol-,Avatar,7,25 December 2016,"In a future in which nobody leaves their home, instead traveling from place to place in linked-in surrogate robots, it is up to an overworked policeman to solve a crime by leaving his home without a surrogate in this intriguing science fiction thriller starring Bruce Willis. The film is jam-packed with interesting ideas (surrogates prevent accidental deaths; surrogates can be upgraded for extra agility) and the glimpse into a society inundated with this craze is fascinating with obvious parallels to internet avatars and virtual reality programs today. There are some personal identity issues too and the film gets a lot of mileage from contrasting how different the users look to their surrogates. The makeup used to reverse-age Willis is especially remarkable. The thriller plot that develops is unfortunately never quite as interesting as the set-up and the plethora of unanswered questions (particularly regarding the health and fitness of the homebound users) leave an uneasy taste in the mouth, but this is nevertheless an undeniably entertaining ride. There is a particularly good action sequence with Radha Mitchell jumping between rooftops of moving cars; in fact, Mitchell gives the film's most interesting performance as her surrogate is hijacked and she begins to act ever-so-differently and yet without any of her colleagues catching on. Willis has done better before and this is not the sort of film to really maximise his acting prowess. His sadness over his son's death resonates though, and all the more so since the accidental death could have been prevented had the son been using a surrogate.",Surrogates
37,Floated2,Could have been something real special,4,1 September 2010,"Well, sometimes there's really nothing better than an exciting sci-fi premise, a take on our future that resonates nicely with the present and doesn't feel like a thin variation on what we've seen before. But there's nothing worse than seeing that premise squandered, which is exactly the fate of Surrogates, a movie that is handed a fascinating concept and slaps onto it a generic conspiracy plot that's as boring as it is impossible to follow. The problem with this film is that they tried to include too many subplots (his conflict with his wife, his female partner twist, finding the son death). And they tried to make it as suspenseful but I think that failedIn the not-so-distant future, technology has advanced to the point that humans use mind-controlled robots to go about their daily lives, letting the robots-- or surrogates-- experience the world while we relax at home in tricked-out Barcaloungers. Bruce Willis plays Greer, an FBI investigator who is at first living life like everyone else through his surrogate, who is Bruce Willis wearing a half-ton of pancake makeup and a ludicrous blond wig. Like every cop in the history of movies, Greer is haunted by the memory of a dead son and paired up with spunky female partner Peters (Radha Mitchell), whose surrogate only looks a little less ridiculous because she requires less makeup to look perfect. Overall the movie was okay but could have been something real good. They should have had many more ideas of surrogates that people could use, like creatures or clone-likes of famous celebrities.

38,TheMovieDiorama,"Surrogates is another exercise in ""great concept, poor execution"".",5,5 September 2018,"Ever thought to yourself ""wow, actually that would make for an intellectually stimulating and philosophically provocative film challenging both morals and ethics""? No? Really? Just me then. Surrogates is just that, with a apt theme that becomes more timely and relevant as time inevitably progresses on. Unfortunately, it is imbued in mediocrity. An FBI agent investigates a series of murders, to which each victim is a humanoid robot known as a ""surrogate"". Let's put aside the clichéd murder mystery for a moment, and focus on the conceptual idea of ""surrogates"". Idyllically designed robots that enable humans to experience life from the comfort and safety of their own abode. Work, procrastinate, procreate, pro-whatever. These androids assume the life role of the human, negating the requirement for humanity. Crime rates are lowered, economy is booming and happiness is flourishing. The addiction for essentially role-playing the perfect life is quite subversive. That's where the film excels. Illustrating innovative technology that is plausible and galvanising. Just a shame that the second and third act shift the focus to a dull derivative crime plot that boasts minimal twists with underwhelming results. The screenplay is not enticing enough to make us care in searching for the culprit. The characters are not developed enough to pull off any twists. Unnecessarily convoluted. Not to mention Mostow's reliance on diagonal camera angles, sorry but it makes the whole production look like it's a music video. What I will say, much to my surprise, was that the acting was fine. I had no quarrels with Willis' monotonous acting, in fact it suited his ""surrogate"" and actually his human character did have a few emotional moments. Mitchell and Pike remain underrated as ever. It's a good cast, one that certainly enticed me. However, the visual effects were mediocre at best. This sci-fi mystery is a bittersweet experience. A stupendously captivating concept that clearly started running out of ideas and quickly became a disposable mess.",Surrogates
39,Movie_Muse_Reviews,A sci-fi concept well examined despite predictable story patterns,6,17 May 2010,"With the number of mainstream movies centered around a future human dependency on robots, it would be incredibly stupid if we actually let that happen. ""Surrogates"" is the latest of these concepts and surprisingly one of the more well thought-out ones. Based on the graphic novel by Robert Venditti and Brett Weldele, ""Surrogates"" imagines a world where humans interact with the world solely through robot versions of themselves called surrogates. They don't have to leave their homes and are impervious to danger.Writers Michael Ferris and John D. Brancato, who previously collaborated with director Jonathan Mostow on ""Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines"" and sadly also wrote the Halle Berry ""Catwoman,"" do their best work with this script, which is of course not saying much. The positive here is that they truly embrace and explored the possibilities of a word where people don't interact with people -- just the robot versions of themselves. It's the saving grace of the film. Bruce Willis stars as a homicide detective assigned to the very first case on record where the actual human operator of a surrogate died when the surrogate was killed. With nearly all of the planet using surrogates, any knowledge of danger would throw the world into panic. Willis -- Det. Greer -- must track down the weapon that did the damage. When his surrogate is destroyed, Greer begins to re-examine life through non-virtual eyes.Without question, however, the concept and the setting are far more clever than the script. Ironically like robots, when you boil down the exterior of ""Surrogates,"" it's composed of overused clichés and recycled components of Isaac Asimov and Philip K. Dick stories. The simple premise and thoroughly conceived world of ""Surrogates"" manages to override some lousy story lines and character development, but I'm not sure that most viewers who come to ""Surrogates"" looking for more action and less high-concept science fiction will be able to say the same.The subplots and back stories given to Greer and other characters are throw-away. At 89 minutes long, ""Surrogates"" offers just enough in terms of story development to be a glorified TV detective show set in the future. The twists are foreseeable and the character motivations barely scratched at, but it keeps your attention and stays focused enough on the central story that you never have to actually dwell on the more hollow elements of the film. The venerable James Cromwell, who plays the disgruntled inventor of surrogates, has never looked more shallow in a role, but it's hardly of any consequence.Sci-fi epiphany? None here, but a well-calculated exploration of a possible new technology - - yes. ""Surrogates"" is not mindless fun, but it's not artistic science fiction perfected to a tee either. It does just enough to intrigue the future-curious mind with a different cut from the same robot mold.~Steven CVisit my site moviemusereviews.com",Surrogates

However, the filmmakers could think more out-of-the-box, i.e. I do not think the US society would be arranged in the same way in the further future (incl. police, military structures, daily shopping). And moralizing on the issues of mortality, clones and ethic dilemmas has been exploited too much; moreover, I am sure that there are plenty of people desiring eternal youth or their alter ego's.

42,freemantle_uk,An average sci-fi thriller,7,15 August 2010,"Surrogates is based on a graphic novel by Robert Venditti and Brett Weldele, which became a big-budget sci-fi film. With a budget of $80 Million it was released in September 2009: September and October is often a period for smaller films to be released between the Summer and Christmas seasons. Surrogates bombed and was met with a hostile reception from critics.Set in an un-specific date in the future 98% of humans now live their lives in robotic surrogates, giving most people perfect looks and safety to do anything whilst their bodies are at home. But there is a movement lead by the Prophet (Ving Rhames) who believe that humanity should rejects surrogates and live in slum reservations in city across America. There are called 'dreads'. A new threat emerges when two people using their surrogates are killed through an electronic device. This case is the first murder for years and raises a real risk for the majority of the population. A grief stricken FBI agent Tom Greer (Bruce Willis) and his partner Jennifer Peters (Radha Mitchell) are assigned the case, leading them to a conspiracy involving a powerful monopoly and the dreads.Surrogates is Jonathan Mostow's first film since directing Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines, destroying everything set up in Terminator 2: Judgement Day and basically remade that film as a parody. He also directed the awful U-571 which shows Hollywood's ability to hijack the bravery of British sailors during World War 2 and rewrite history. He does a better job with Surrogates, directing some decent action sequences and to anyone who is interested in the functions of society and a futuristic version of history. The history of riots and social change is well told with news footage and showing the different aspects of conflict in this new world. But Mostow relies on a screenplay by John Brancato and Michael Ferris whoms track-record includes Terminator 3, Terminator Salvation and Catwoman: hardly promising and they do a write a script with holes, like if people can put themselves in a robotic body why do people need cars or public transport, how do people work?, would gun be pointless in a world like this? The plot itself is a standard sci-fi/crime hybrid and told in a short running time. The plot itself does have some really similarities to I, Robot. Surrogates does have a feel of a Philip K. Dick adaptation, with similarities to Minority Report, such as the main character being a member of law enforcement, who is grieving for his lost son and a new technology has made crime really low. Also there is a similarity to The Matrix and Avatar (despite that film being released after Surrogates) where a person can put their mind in a perfect body.Surrogates was held back from critics which is never a good sign, but this film was okay. There was some interesting ideas like how a technology designed to be used by disabled people and to perform dangerous tasks gets highjacked by regular people and the real physical people are dramatically altered. As stated the history and the news reports were well handled and the Dreads are interesting, living in a slum and were a mix, from religious fanatics, rednecks, Amish and people of the term reservations Native American who are defensive over their little territory.Willis offers a decent performance shows he still has some action chops, though he wears the most ridiculous wig when he is a robot. But most of the other actors are pretty robotic (yes I know most of them are robots). They have little to work with and most characters are underdeveloped. I like Rhames as an actor, having incredible roles in Pulp Fiction and Dawn of the Dead; but he does look silly with the big beard and unkept hair. I do wonder if the filmmakers were trying to make him look like Osama Bin Laden. I'm sure the graphic novel had more depth in plot and character development which could have worked in a 2 hour film but it was seen fit to cut larges parts of it.Overall Surrogates is average but it's enjoyable enough to see on TV. A weird footnote is that the comic actress Elizabeth Banks was producer of the film.",Surrogates

Some parts were dull but by in large it presents an interesting story and features a strong and steady performance by Bruce Willis who plays a human and the human's robot double. The movie explores an interesting theme: the quest for vicarious satisfaction without risk. It's thought provoking theme. But don't expect anything exciting. After all, how shocked can one become when watching ""someone's"" face being peeled off just to discover that the ""person"" is a machine? Unless you are robot yourself, or a mechanic, it's not the kind of stuff that will make a strong dramatic impression, no matter how well the machine is crafted.

Humans now live their lives in ""surrogates"", which are human-like robots which they control from the safety of their beds. Bruce Willis plays an FBI agent who lost his son and whose wife has become a recluse because she was horribly scarred in the car accident.He's assigned to investigate the death of the son of the inventor of surrogates, an eccentric scientist played by James Cromwell. (Sorry, is this about the 10th movie where Cromwell has played an eccentric scientist? Talk about your typecasting.) There are a whole lot of improbabilities in this setup. First is, a surrogate would strike me as being fairly expensive to maintain, yet everyone can afford one? Still, there is a great parable here in a society where too many of us have our only human contact through the internet (at work and personally) and the outside world becomes a scarier place. Especially great is when you find out the hot blonde is actually an overweight guy. It has captured the deceit and isolation of the cyber world perfectly by taking it to its next step.The scene at the end where the surrogates are shut down and everyone wanders into the street in their pajamas was a great metaphor.The story itself is very workmanlike, although the twists come about a mile off.

Its definitely entertaining with an intriguing futuristic sci-fi world where people no longer go outside but instead live their lives plugged into robotic surrogates which they control from their homes.Bruce Willis plays Greer, an FBI agent investigating the first murder in years. He looks really weird at first, bad wig, strange make up but who you are actually seeing is his surrogate. There are some decent action scenes along the way, cool special effects as the surrogates can do superhuman things and Bruce does a good job playing both. Ving Rhames also looks very cool as ""The Prophet"" the leader of the resistance. I also enjoyed seeing how people could no longer function in the real world, anxiety, wasted muscles etc.Yes there are some plot holes along the way: the movie states in the intro that with the use of surrogates crime (and disease) go down exponentially. My thought here is that crime and crazy behaviour in general would go up because there are no consequences for your actions as you are just sitting at home living a repercussion free existence. They also state that 95% of the world population uses a surrogate. How are the poor affording these? So yes some plot holes but whatever its flaws very entertaining.

The movie represents a kind of an over-the-top perspective on what some of us do with our internet and online game persona's in our current times. The concept is kind of hokey and certain things just don't make sense, but the movie keeps your interest throughout enough for me to recommend the movie --but just barely. The movie stars Bruce Willis as an FBI agent who's investigating some humans who are dying when their surrogates get snuffed off. This is not supposed to happen in this world, but there is apparently some kind of weapon that breaks thru the barriers and Willis's character is trying to find the weapon and who is using it. One of the deaths was of a son of the inventor of the surrogates, which also causes suspicions. The trek to find out what was happening and why was interesting, and Willis and others gave OK performances. The movie was not over-the-top with special effects, but the director just let the story take over and this usually is a good thing and it was this time. Overall, this was a good but not great movie, that was entertaining and raised some questions about where we might be heading in our current world if we don't change.",Surrogates

Officers Greer (the ever-reliable action man Bruce Willis) and Peters (the somewhat miscast Radha Mitchell) of the FBI are assigned to the case. Greer had his surrogate destroyed during a helicopter attack, so he had to continue his investigation as a human.The very intelligent script (based on a graphic novel) is very interesting in its twists and turns. The audience is definitely kept at the edge of their seats with the heart-stopping action. There are also scenes of heart-breaking drama about the relationship between Greer and his wife Maggie (the ever frosty Rosamund Pike) as they differ in their opinions about surrogates.

49,JoeKarlosi,Surrogates (2009) **1/2,6,11 February 2010,"In a futuristic society, it seems 99% of human beings have become so lazy and dependent on technology that all they want to do all day is sit or lie around at home and allow their brains to be plugged into robotic ""surrogates"", which they can send out into the world to do all their living and working for them. These surrogates can be altered to look any way you want; for example, in the case of aging cop Bruce Willis, it means a younger-looking dapper version of his real self with a full head of hair. Supposedly the widespread use of robots instead of real people has lessened crime statistics (ridiculous; more on this later) so when the first heinous murders in many years start occurring, Willis decides to unplug himself from his duplicate and set out in his true form to investigate. It seems there is a small group of human resistance (lead by Ving Rhames) who are out to destroy all the surrogates, and promote ""Human Power!"". I was actually rather sympathetic to their stance. Willis in human form is okay, yet by-the-numbers here, as he tries to regain control of his real self and unravel the mystery.I'm a big science fiction fan and I have a very long threshold for suspension of disbelief in such fantastic stories. But even for me there are so many plot holes in this premise that it really diminished what might have been a really good movie. First and foremost, if such a technology WAS possible to such an extent, would virtually ALL humans be willing to engage in practicing this style of ""faux living""? I'd highly doubt it. How can poor people afford these robots? And getting back to the ""low crime thing""... how could that be? If a person was able to lie back and engage his brain in whatever fantasy he wished through means of a mechanical surrogate, wouldn't he go out of his way to do anything and everything he dreamt about, without concern? What's to stop a human from thinking his surrogate into all sorts of random acts of violence and rape, if that's what his secret desires were? I've heard that this story has already been at least partially done before in films like I, ROBOT and THE MATRIX (I haven't seen either). But I did like the concept that we as human beings are getting way too dependent on technology. For years now I have often thought to myself that everything's getting so stupefyingly easy that one day all people are going to have to do is place a simple chip into their brains and they'll be able to conduct their day to day business while they sleep.

51,ferbs54,Phil Would Have Liked It,8,18 September 2010,"Had I not known better, I would have said that the 2009 sci-fi/action film ""Surrogates"" was based on a work by cult author Philip K. Dick. And with its central premise of a futuristic society in which the bulk of humankind lies abed, while its mentally controlled robotic surrogates carry on the dangerous and tiring business of everyday life for it, the film really is reminiscent of something that Phil might have smiled on with approbation. But no, this picture is rather based on a graphic novel by Robert Venditti and Brett Weldele. In it, federal agent Tom Greer (played by a typically excellent Bruce Willis) investigates a rare instance of homicide in this new society and unearths a plot that threatens the lives of billions. The film's entirely plausible central premise (who wouldn't want to safely lie in bed all day, whilst a mechanical surrogate of any description takes upon itself the rigors of life?) has here been used as the backbone for a supremely well-crafted and intelligent instance of modern-day science fiction; indeed, ""Surrogates"" may well be one of the finest sci-fi films of its decade. It features a compact screenplay, a twisty and surprise-laden plot, great-looking yet restrained use of FX, and several spectacular--yet remarkably lucid--action set pieces. The film has been well acted by all, especially Willis (in what almost amounts to a dual role: human and surrogate) and the yummy Rosamund Pike, who I have had a ""thang"" for ever since seeing her portray Miranda Frost in Bond 20, ""Die Another Day."" And this near-future world, in which one can role-play any fantasy via the use of male or female surrogates, sets us up for a great line from Willis. Speaking to a beautiful female lawyer, he says, ""Honey, I don't know what you are. For all I know, you could be some big fat dude sitting in a stim chair with his dick hanging out."" A wonderful line, in a wonderful picture. Highly recommended.",Surrogates
52,Enchorde,Entertaining action,6,26 October 2010,"Recap: In a near future almost everyone is using the surrogates, almost indestructible robots that let us lead our lives in the safety of our own homes with the robots taking all the risks. Both violent crimes and accidents drop to almost nothing, so it is deeply disturbing when agents Greer and Peters are called to the scene of an apparent homicide. Not only the robots are destroyed, but their operators through them. Everyone is suddenly at risk, and the perfect life that the surrogates have given is under threat. And Greer suddenly finds himself in a conspiracy far deeper than he ever thought possible.Comments: A good enough action with some nice effects. Too short and shallow to really go any deeper than the surface of the issues it presents, though it hints at them with Greer's past and difficulties with his wife. But it seems that the director decided for simple entertaining action. And they did quite a good job with it. Willis is a solid veteran in the genre and delivers, and along with the action and effects it is a good movie.But lacking a more complex story or almost any suspense it, it is just an average action, nothing more. It's a good idea, but something that could have been developed further. But, then again, one shouldn't overlook the worth in entertainment. Maybe better to go with safe results than risking it with adding more.6/10",Surrogates

I have been to the message boards and people have raised a lot of questions, so in defense of the film I would say that for the same reason why they did not show 3rd world countries is the same reason why they didn't show other countries as developed America. The film is about the founding father of the surrogates (who happens to be an American) and what happens in the future now that 90% of humans use surrogates.

The idea of artificial bodies that preclude the need for any kind of face to face human interaction could have been used to really explore themes of loneliness, isolation, physical attraction, morality, anonymity, and countless other issues. This movie could have gone in a billion satisfactory directions.Unfortunately, most of those issues get left on the table. Surrogates plays things extremely safe. You get a bare-bones plot about how the machines are de-humanizing, with little effort on the filmmakers part to convince the viewer of that fact, beyond them telling us so. I realize that this was never intended to be some deep, introspective study on the human condition, but recent summer blockbusters like Minority Report and I, Robot managed to go a bit deeper than chase scenes and explosions, so I don't understand why Surrogates couldn't have done better than it's anemic attempt at two parents halfheartedly coping with a lost son.Moving on, we have Willis giving a serviceable performance in the kind of role that he's had many times before, and could probably do in his sleep. And we can't fail to mention the two principle female actresses/stunners, Radha Mitchell and Rosamund Pike. They keep the plot sexy and moving along, if little else. The whole movie speeds by with little impact, but I can't really complain about much beyond the wasted potential. Surrogates is a decent exercise in (extremely) lite sci-fi, and as long as you don't expect more than that, you'll find it to be 89 minutes of ""okay"".",Surrogates

I say, Bruce Willis as well as Radha Mitchell and Rosamund Pike have not lost their master touch and they play freely, convincingly and very very well. Yes, the film does not thrive on various FX's but it is not the main aim. The film is deeper and more sincere in its appeal - surrogates may be really evil. The final scene is probably the best in the movie and it thrills with its cold-blooded cynicism. The final message may ring a bit naive, but still, the film never drags, it keeps very involved and very interested. I think, it managed to fulfill what the filmmakers intended - to show how bad the super developed technology may become.",Surrogates
57,Troy_Campbell,This doesn't deserve a big screen viewing,5,30 September 2009,"Why do filmmakers choose to use computer effects for something they could do for real? Well sometimes it costs less and other times it is much easier, that's why. Shame it never looks as good. In Surrogates you are treated to shonky CGI that would look poor even in the nineties; the good news is there are a handful of exciting action scenes to distract you for a while, the bad news is there are some dreadful action scenes that only emphasize just how cheap the effects really are.Director Jonathan Mostow hasn't directed a feature film since Terminator 3 (he did direct made-for-TV Them a couple of years ago) and it's a wonder he thought this was the one worth returning to the big screen for. It surely was the intriguing premise behind the story; humans using avatars to live their lives is a terrific idea. However come time to develop this into a film and the wheels have fallen off. Mostow doesn't even know the rules to his own universe, constantly bending or breaking them to keep the plot going regardless if they make any sense. Perhaps that little James Cameron movie released in December can do the avatar story right? Bruce Willis is 54. It is starting to show. His gruff appearance gives his emotional scenes more punch then they deserve but when it comes to the rough and tumble he is less convincing. The emotionally scarred Agent Greer is likable and thankfully Willis ensures he is someone the audience will want to cheer for. Aussie Radha Mitchell does as much as she can in her undercooked role as Greer's FBI partner and Rosamund Pike stands above the rest as Greer's deeply depressed wife. On the other hand James Cromwell is surprisingly ineffective in his mysterious part and Ving Rhames is pitiful as the leader of the 'free' humans.A few lively sequences and a charismatic turn from Willis go a small way in salvaging the atrocious screenplay and terrible CGI, but this doesn't deserve a big screen viewing.2.5 out of 5 (1 - Rubbish, 2 - Ordinary, 3 - Good, 4 - Excellent, 5 - Classic)",Surrogates
58,dunmore_ego,Rage Against The Machines.,7,20 July 2010,"Into this world where we poke, surf, tweet, blog, smile, frown, pillow fight - all without actually DOING any of it - comes a movie showing us exactly what would happen if our computers really could poke, surf, blog, smile, frown and pillow fight for us.We'd be sending them out as surrogates for our Selves, in humanoid guise, younger and better-looking than our Selves, controlled remotely by us via neural links. Is this not exactly what we are doing right now ""virtually"" in our myriad online identities? SURROGATES may still be termed ""science fiction,"" but only by the barest of margins - and for how much longer? In this Jonathan Mostow thriller (from the graphic novel by Robert Venditti and Brett Weldes), ""surrogates"" do practically everything that humans used to do. Surrogates are the ones who venture out into the ""real"" world while humans are relegated to the virtual, sitting motionless in recliners, blinders over their eyes, atrophying in darkened rooms in front of their computer screens.Bruce Willis is Detective Tom Greer. When we first meet him we giggle into our atrophied palms at his stunning Swedish platinum blond hairdo. Soon enough, Tom enters a room where his human operator reclines at a virtual control center - a shaved-headed, rugged yet tired-looking Bruce Willis. I ask you, gentlemen, if you had the thunderfist visage of grizzled, steel-eyed avenger Bruce Willis, would you really want to look like a poreless Swedish boytoy? With his even blonder and sexier partner Peters (Radha Mitchell), Swedish Tom investigates a slew of murders where people have died at their chairs when their surrogates were destroyed. The surrogate manufacturer VSI (Virtual Self Industries) insists that should not be possible. James Cromwell plays the CEO of VSI, a recluse who sends out little boys as surrogates to take meetings with Bruce's dollyboy.VSI's slogan is ""Life... Only Better."" A contingent of humans don't agree, and rebel against the surrogate fad, banding together in Humans Only communities, led by The Prophet (Ving Rhames).Tom's surrogate is destroyed and he has to venture into the real world in the flesh. The robot-themed movie suddenly becomes a fish-out-of-water tale. Years in the dark have made all humans paranoid agoraphobics, and though Tom ""acts"" like he is scared of crowds and has panic attacks against being touched or broken, he battles against looking too much like tough guy Bruce Willis. Now sitting in a chair all day should make any normal person potbellied, atrophied and slovenly, but luckily Tom's real world surrogate is The Bruce Willis - the older he gets, the more like a rock he becomes.But it doesn't suddenly become a fist-fest. In this thought-provoking drama, the action scenes are not gratuitous, but organic to the plot and more powerful for their suddenness and infrequency.Rosamund Pike plays Tom's wife, who has not ventured out in years. In a subplot, Tom's Bruce avatar tries to draw her out, but her mannequin-like hairdresser avatar simply shuts down in front of him.Tom slash Bruce thunderfists his way to discovering a plot involving the destruction of all surrogates, to force humans into reemerging from their self-imposed home exiles.And I cannot help but see the disturbing parallels with our Real World. We have become our disembodied icons. Watch carefully as you walk down a city street, or in a restaurant or gym - in these public places where humans used to congregate and interact, now the vast majority are connected to electronic devices; people would rather talk to a person on their phone than the person sitting right next to them in a restaurant! Online, our surrogates deal with buying, selling, meeting, organizing, chatting, sexing... those impostor selves are out there in the www ether living better lives than we are; Wii and karaoke and thousands of phone apps emulate real world activities to dupe us into relying on our avatars like addictive drugs. The pushback comes in the form of the ""green"" fad and the manufacturers of sports gear and the live band promoters - marketing that it's better to GO OUTSIDE. Tragic that 'going outside' has degenerated to nothing more than a marketing ploy, which is in turn combated by electronics manufacturers in making everything electronic compact enough to take with you... outside.The irony is too obvious: we may feel more connected but we are more isolated than ever.After penning the mildly-watchable chase movie, TERMINATOR 3: RISE OF THE MACHINES, Michael Ferris and James Brancato outdo themselves with their dark vision in SURROGATES. James Cameron directed the first TERMINATOR. And in SURROGATES, people neural link to surrogate bodies to move amongst society. Just like James Cameron's AVATAR. See how plagiarism itself is a surrogate for storytelling in Hollywood? When all the surrogates drop ""dead"" in the cities, a radio announcer's final words, ""It appears, at least for now, that we are on our own..."" Startling words for a species that is overpopulating the planet. Yet all too true for the aptly-named Twit generation who have entombed themselves in their domiciles erroneously believing they have ""friends"" because their facebook page tells them so, sitting motionless in recliners, blinders over their eyes, atrophying in darkened rooms in front of computer screens...",Surrogates
59,Sirus_the_Virus,This is a surprisingly interesting picture.,7,21 January 2010,"Bruce Willis does what he usually does in films, kick ass, in Surrogates, or The Surrogates. Except this is a sci-fi film. The Surrogates is a very interesting film. Is it the best sci-fi film i've seen this year? Perhaps not, but I was entertained by every minute of the film.The movie does have a couple of flaws. One is that though the movie is original, the whole robot type deal has been used before. James Cromwell plays a similar character that he did in I, robot, but I think this is a little better. Ving Rhames' character looks kind of silly. Those are really the flaws, and it's not like they're a big deal either. The film takes place in a world where humans are isolated. They actually have robot type things called Surrogates doing their work. The surrogates are the attractive version of someone. As you can tell by seeing Bruce Willis, Radha Mitchell, and Rosmund Pike's characters.Bruce Willis stars as Agent Tom Greer. Him and his partner(played by Radha Mitchell)are trying to solve the murder of a younger man who is actually the son of the creator of the Surrogates(played by James Cromwell). While trying to catch this killer, Greer's surrogate is destroyed. So he must go on in the world as his older normal human self. Greer is having troubles with his wife(played by Rosmund Pike). They don't really communicate that much. Obviously this is a problem. As himself, Greer must continue to find the killer and eventually has to prevent the end of the surrogates.This is a very entertaining film. The cast is good. Some of the action sequences look kind of cheesy but the Surrogates has it's moments of awesomeness. Especially in the climax. Is this movie art? No. But I think you should give it a chance. It's a lot of fun.Surrogates:***/****",Surrogates

Acting of Bruce is very low and so of others. watchable at once.",Surrogates
62,sarastro7,By far one of the year's best sci-fi movies,9,12 October 2009,"As a passionate sci-fi aficionado I embark on a dedicated pilgrimage to the cinema whenever a new science fiction movie opens. If it's a big movie I'll probably have heard something about it beforehand, and have some details to base my expectations on. If it's a movie I haven't heard anything about, my expectations tend to be less than great. Until the trailers and promotional movie posters appeared in my local movie houses, I had heard nothing about Surrogates. I am therefore pleased to report that this movie was very satisfying to me, clearly exceeding my expectations. After having watched it and thought about it, I decided to rate it a 7 out of 10, just possibly an 8. I thought it had various shortcomings, the most important of which was that the sheer entertainment value just wasn't that great. After having heard other people's take on the movie, however (through the user comments on IMDb, for instance), I must conclude that a lot of people didn't understand it very well, and that it is hence a very good example of a movie that singles out science fiction fans as its target audience, while being too big a handful for most mainstream audiences. Considering this fact, and also the fact that a lot of people see it as an action movie when in fact the movie in several ways made an effort *not* to be an action movie, I have to raise my rating of it to a whopping 10 out of 10.What prompted me to write this comment was actually the movie review program ""Premiere"" on Danish TV, in which famous Danish actress Iben Hjejle demonstrated that she did not understand this movie. After having stated that she couldn't explain what it was about and then showing the trailer in place of a summary, she criticized the movie for having only some dirty hippies for the human audience to identify with. She wanted much rather to be a part of the beautiful surrogate community with its stylish fashion and gadgetry. Well, how better to illustrate the very point of this movie?! We, the real people of today, naive consumers and thoughtless (over)workers, are the surrogates. Robot-like morons whose real humanity is shriveled up inside, hardly ever seeing the light of day. We are concerned with surface, image, shields and fronts to mask our insecurity and self-loathing, while all the time we are dying inside. This movie follows the example of classics like Romero's Dawn of the Dead which presents the common consumer as a mindless zombie, and Matrix which shows us a symbolic surface world that paints the real world of today as a pretense utopia; as the world that ignorant and superficial people (= those who support the current socio-political establishment) think is the best of all possible worlds. And shows us what a total illusion this is. This is incredibly cool, penetrating and insightful. And not just maybe. It IS.Surrogates doesn't make many mistakes. It spends an enormous amount of time on building up and describing this world, but it doesn't entirely follow through. If people hardly ever actually see each other physically anymore, how are children even produced? This is not explained. But maybe the lack of explanation is a point in itself: this world is effectively sterile.I don't mind the lack of explanation as to whether the poor and homeless also have surrogates, because the whole point of the movie is to present a squeaky clean surface, smoothing away any problems that may exist. A sickly obsession with niceness, as we know from the 1950s and indeed from every subsequent (and certainly current) mindset that wants to present the real world of today as the only viable and possible world; a world that will never significantly change because we have reached the end of history and this is all there is, and let's all be good social-Darwinists and forget about the poor and homeless who have only themselves to blame. This is the view - the wishful and delusional thinking of everyone from the petty bourgeoisie and the middle classes to the ruling elite itself - that the Surrogate world of this movie is conveying. And ultimately tearing down, for the sake of all our well-being.As for the action elements; well, considering that the police officers have amazingly augmented surrogates, so that they are effectively superheroes, the action scenes are actually very few and far between. Of course, since there is very little crime there is also very little opportunity to flash these superhuman augmentations. But this is all a part of the allegory of the real world: the state and its monopoly on violence (executed by the police and FBI, etc.) is inordinately more powerful than the common person, and seen by those who do not support the establishment as intensely oppressive. Hence, the humans' attacking of Willis' character in the human encampment represents rebellion against the established order of things. The symbolism pretty much holds up across the board.The CGI-effects are quite sparingly used; for the surrogates they have simply used the real actors and just smoothed out their facial features a bit, so they look slightly synthetic (as was done quite meaninglessly and completely unnecessarily with Milla Jovovich in Resident Evil 3). This is good use of special effects. All in all, this movie is so good that it reminds me of a more polished version of Blade Runner; a world in which almost everybody has become replicants, and the result is a social abomination. Great work. I'll definitely get the DVD as soon as it comes out. What a shame that so many people can't appreciate good science fiction movies properly.10 out of 10.",Surrogates

64,gregsrants,Willis makes it watchable,5,25 September 2009,"With the action heroes of my generation all too old or M.I.A. (Ford, Hackman, Eastwood), I have consistently made the comment, ""Thank God for Bruce Willis"". Good ole Bruce, aging towards his mid-fifties, consistently brings action films to our local theatres year after year after year. As an actor, he has 70+ projects contained within his historical biography and the guy keeps making bad films mediocre and mediocre films watchable.Surprisingly, he has but one credit to his name in 2009, Surrogates, a film that looks ripped from just about every other science fiction fantasy you have ever seen or read.Extracted by a graphic novel by Robert Venditti and Brett Weldele, Surrogates transports us to a future where people live through robotic surrogates from the privacy and safety of their own sanctuary and can manipulate their avatars into either copies of themselves or they can transform themselves into just about anything they want (I say just about anything because the world was not full of Megan Fox's). The opening credits give us a 14 year history of how we got to whatever future we are in at Present Day.But when a murder – the first in an eon – occurs, FBI agent Greer (Willis) is assigned the case and his subsequent investigation outside of his own surrogate is filled with enough revelations to bring down the entire Utopian world.I can't even begin to ramble of the countless movies the Surrogates borrows from in an effort to keep us entertained for the very swift 88 minutes of running time. Hell, there were even a few television programs I thought it copied for certain scenes.That noted, Surrogates is not all that bad. Director Jonathon Mostow (Terminator 3 – which I actually liked) might not have put the most seasoned piece of sci-fi on the screen, but he could have done much worse with the cheesy premise.The special effects are kinda few and kinda crappy. A scene with a surrogate riding on the hood of a car was blue screen embarrassment. But the special effects are kept in tow as Mostow tries for more of an atmosphere than he does an all out future world experience.Bruce Willis always throws me off in movies where he has hair and Ving Rhames shows up as a human (?) who opposes the surrogate conglomerate. It's been 15 years since Rhames and Willis had screen time together and I was thankful there was no plastic ball in their mouth and a gimp parading in front of them while they approached their purpose in the script.Surprisingly, for all the borrowing and lack of any true originality, Surrogates, is watchable. The ideas are all squished (think of a marshmallow being squeezed through a key hole) into an entertaining if not enthralling sit that might not exactly be worth $50 and a babysitter to make a night out of, but it can easily be a rewarding DVD rental in the new year.Recommendation is clearly to rent it.www.killerreviews.com",Surrogates
65,deatman9,Never made it through this one.,5,9 October 2012,I have tried twice now and every time I try to sit through this movie I end up falling alseep. I don't know what it is. Perhaps its the very robotic acting of willis which is unusual for him. Something about this movie made it impossible for me to get into it.This movie is about a whole world who control themselves using robots called surrogates. So people register a surrogate chose how it looks then live their everyday lives through these robots.

66,kuarinofu,Feels like the first draft of the script,6,19 January 2020,"Surrogates has a great concept, it's full of interesting ideas and details, but it's so crude and unrefined it barely holds up. They just throw everything they have came up with at you, not trying to make it all work as a complete story.The premise is super straightforward and even a little boring yet the movie still feels needlessly convoluted and tangled up in its subplots. It is relatively short by today's standards too.I first thought that this was a low budget sci-fi (even though Willis is big, he still does random films when he wants to), but it's actually not. This film doesn't look good for a 80 mil production at all, the CGI was not great and doesn't hold up, while some practical effects of the surrogates looked like they were ripped straight from Carpenter's ""They Live!"".This film really needed more details, world- and character building based on a much more fleshed out script. The concepts were there. But as it went it was getting more and more stupid and contradictory (with lots of plot holes as well, with my favorite being face-scanning security in a world where you can have any face you want :D).In its current form it's too unrefined to be taken seriously and the ending just turns into a comedy with those action scenes.I'd still recommend this to sci-fi fans because while watching it you can build a better story with what they give you in your head and think about that.Also, a good example of a better-built world would've been Duncan Jones' ""Mute"" (2018). It's not a perfect film as well but it feels so much more immersive and ambient.",Surrogates
67,jdkraus,Stepford Wives meets The Matrix,6,25 September 2009,"To be honest, I did not know what to expect from this movie. I went to see it for two reasons. One, I like Bruce Willis. Two, I love the sci-fi films, even though this year proves that the genre is not going well with movies such as ""Terminator 4"" and ""District 9"". Without giving too much away, the movie takes place in the present day where almost each human being on the planet owns a surrogate, or a robot of themselves and does day-to-day things for them.the general idea of being a perfect being. But when two surrogates and their owners are murdered, detective Greer (Bruce Willis) is hot on the case. But it takes him down a path of deceit, danger, and sudden realization. Though the plot is interesting, it really isn't anything new. The idea that humans have become lazy and turned to technology to do everything for us, but it comes back to bite us and invade has been seen again and again such as: ""The Stepford Wives"", ""The Matrix"", ""Walle"", ""I, Robot"", and ""The Terminator Series"". Particularly with ""The Stepford Wives"" and ""The Matrix"".But, what makes the films I've listed above different from ""Surrogates"" is that they take different and creative approaches. ""Surrogates"" in my opinion just borrowed ideas from different sci-fi films and put them together. Also the films listed above add a sense of reality to themselves. The city in ""Surrogates"" really doesn't feel like a city, rather a colorful, comic book setting. This would have made for a great comic book or a graphic novel. It unfortunately isn't based on one from what I've gathered. I'll admit, I did enjoy the 88-minute movie. It's fast-paced and there is a twist at the end, which is always good. The performances are okay. Bruce still has the charisma as the loner action-hero that he always plays, however, some character depth is added to his character, which is another plus compared to being a stereotypical hero. **1/2 out of ****If you want to see this movie, I'd suggest waiting for DVD.

68,Superunknovvn,"A poor man's version of ""Avatar"" meets ""I, Robot""",4,6 January 2010,"If you watch the trailer you'll know from the get go that the premise of ""Surrogates"" isn't the most original one: In the future people rely on robots to carry out their each and every move. They control these robots with their minds, while people's true selves lie around at home all day. This has somehow lead to the end of crime. One day, however, the unthinkable happens: The first murder in years occurs... and Bruce Willis himself is on the case.There are so many holes in this plot it requires the brain of a six year not to be bothered by any of them. Why does living with surrogates mean that there is no crime anymore? How come everybody in America can afford a surrogate? Why are humans, who protest against the usage of surrogates, allowed to live in their own territory where the government must not trespass? Well, let's just say, this isn't exactly a thinking man's movie.There aren't a lot of other aspects that redeem the movie, however: Bruce Willis is laughable right down to his wardrobe, the action isn't very gripping and to call the plot predictable would be an understatement. ""Surrogates"" borrows its look heavily from ""I, Robot"" (which seems like a masterpiece next to this mess), and the story is somewhat reminiscent of ""Avatar"" (although, this is admittedly a stretch, since Johnathan Mostow's movie was produced when ""Avatar"" hadn't even been released).If you are looking for profound science fiction in the vein of ""Blade Runner"", skip this one.

69,DarthVoorhees,Plug in,7,26 September 2009,"Bruce Willis can still cut it. He is the main drawn to this film and elevates above a forgotten Sci-Fi film. Willis is asked to give one of his deepest performances and I couldn't be happier to see him succeed in this film.Surrogates offer a solution to the toils of humanity. Safety by isolation from the outside world and yet tackling it heads on through a puppet. Surrogates have offered the crippled and the elderly new bodies and have made casualties of war non-existent. Safety is their greatest draw and yet Tom Greer has found a murder questioning the very fabric of this new Surrogate society.I didn't know what to expect from Surrogates but I wasn't expecting much. I was however very surprised by one aspect of the film, Bruce Willis. This is the perfect vehicle for him. We have seen Willis and other older action stars attempt to make comebacks by revisiting their older roles. This role is tailor made for Willis. In a sense Surrogates is a story about aging. Willis goes through a midlife crisis, as he looks at his surrogate. Surrogacy has made people see the world as they want to see it and not as it is. This is the social satire that makes this film a step above mediocrity.Willis though is perfect in this role. His Surrogate looks like a revamped plastic action hero. When he unplugs though we see Willis for the aging man he really is. He is able to feel pain again and not just physical pain but also the pain of realizing his life through surrogacy was a fraud. Willis looks terrible unplugged, dirty, balding, and overweight. He plays Greer for a what he is an over the hill cop. This is what I wanted in Live Free or Die Hard.",Surrogates
70,ersinkdotcom,Pretty well made and entertaining,8,30 March 2010,"Surrogates falls under the same lines as I, Robot, the Terminator films, or any other number of movies that warn us against letting technology get too far ahead of us and mankind relying too heavily on machines. It also carries a warning against mankind being too reliable on technology as a means of communicating and us losing the personal touch and not truly or physically living. The film is adapted from the graphic novel written by Robert Venditti and illustrated by Brett Weldele (Ultimate Spider-Man, B-Sides, Southland Tales). Is it a good film? Does it accomplish what it was intended to? I would say yes. I thought it to be pretty well made and entertaining. Was it really anything new? The answer to that question would be no. But is anything really new or something we haven't seen before? Bruce Willis pretty much plays a character you've come to know him by – the rogue cop with family and personal issues who is driven to get the job done by any means necessary. Only, this time he does it packaged for half the film in a Ken-type robot body that has one of the greatest synthetic hairpieces I've seen since Nic Cage's last film was released. Not only does he look like Ken, but his work partner is almost the spitting-image of Barbie. Another completely predictable bit of casting is in James Cromwell, who plays the kooky scientist who gets mislead or whose creation is misused for evil. You know, the same role he's played in movies like I, Robot and Star Trek: First Contact. This is almost verbatim the same role he played in I, Robot for sure. He does a good job at it, though.",Surrogates

Great as thriller, sci-fi, philosophical speculation... this is solid entertainment!",10,25 September 2009,"I loved this movie, but must confess I was surprised how much. I did NOT need another movie about the future--- ""Hey, lookee here, the future is full of technology robbing our souls, and aren't we ever so clever to be making such keen observations about that!"" So I was pleasantly surprised to find that this film was great. So good, in fact, it was uncanny. I am iffy on sci-fi in general. Some I like, some I don't. BUT--- ""Surrogates"" was bright, jazzy, fast-moving, exciting, and entrancing. It had dash, depth, and was wonderful entertainment!To illustrate my point by way of comparison--- The sci-fi genre is kind of done to death, don't you think? And often trite. I mean no offence, but IMHO, 2004's ""I, Robot,"" for example, was ludicrous. Really unbelievable and stupid. Spielberg's 2001 ""Artificial Intelligence"" was much better, but even that was cumbersome and smothering with its self-important ""heavy"" social themes that would have seemed ""far out"" in 1967, but simply plodded along as rather stilted and silly in this century.I checked the cast list for this movie, and noticed it was international, although all spoke with flawless American accents. The director, Willis, and a few others were American, but the leading ladies and others were from Australia, England, and Austria, etc. What a mix! That's all fine... but it makes me speculate on the purpose. Haven't we seen a lot of that in the last 10-12 years? That is, British women playing Americans, Americans playing Brits, Aussies and Kiwis popping up as various nationalities on screen. That's all great--- but it seems like it can't just be coincidence that the director could only find an actor from ""country A"" to fill the role for a character from ""country B."" Each country has a wealth of talent already there and available, and the genuine need to import a specific foreign actor is rare.I suspect it's that even when a foreign accent is adopted by an actor flawlessly, there will nonetheless be a faint, unconscious and subtle hint of the foreign remaining. They will sound authentic, yet different, somehow... exotic perhaps. Am I imaging that?Anyway, this film is extremely well done, and is very worth your while to visit the cinema for a night out. Regardless of your favourite genre, or taste regarding sci-fi or thrillers or ""social comment"" or ""comment on life"" or philosophical ruminations, you will like, and maybe love, this movie.",Surrogates

This movie, like Avatar, uses the same idea of human replacement through cerebral connection and management, but producing two very different results.Bruce Willis and Radha Mitchell, the leading actors, are correct in their respective roles, but none of them really shines in this movie. Not even the supporting ones. That's because, despite the good concept and stylish atmosphere, the script is very poor, and offers little insight into the personal relationships shown in the movie, but also into the murder and the Police investigation.

However some people are objectifying this idea of being through a robotic puppet for some live in communities where they don't need a Surrogate, years later an FBI agent named Greer (Bruce Willis) with helper Peters (Rahda Mitchells) are investigating mysterious killings of surrogates including their owners. They are on the verge of finding who is the madman with the weapon behind this anti-surrogate conspiracy.Entertaining and interesting Sci-fi action thriller from Jonathan Mostow (U-571 and Terminator 3) is based on the graphic novel which i haven't read yet, i think it's one of the most interesting concepts to hit the screen in a while. Although it's been done in the 1995 anime masterpiece ""Ghost in The Shell"" and others in Sci-fi literature, but i assume the graphic novel is superior. Ving Rhames does a small role as The Prophet in this movie, this movie recalls the works of Sci-fi authors Philip K. Dick and Issac Asimov with enough action to get one's attention and ideas wonderfully put together.It's great fun.",Surrogates
75,hollywoodshack,Avatar imitator -- but minus any emotional appeal,6,26 December 2012,"If you accept this premise, Bruce Willis is a detective trying to solve a murder in a futuristic doll house world of robots. All the sickly humans stay in a room somewhere and control them remotely, avatar style. His only wish is to be reunited with his human wife which has also been replaced by a robot. We never see her at all throughout most of the picture. To make the story more frustrating, Vang Rhames, who played SLA leader Donald Cinque in Patty Hearst, is the leader of rebels in the Dread Zone who refuse to use surrogates--but he is really a surrogate himself. So, zero is the score for characters to root for except Willis. The film is heavy on the speedy chases, stunts, fake blood and smashed robot circuity--hey, sometimes a ride on the Matterhorn at Disneyland couldn't get this thrilling! A new ride might get named after it! But couldn't we just have some emotional connection to like this film and stick with its theme of the social dangers of tech overuse? Give the characters some friendships, some sex appeal beyond its dimensions of an 84 minute animated video game. Let the surrogates hunt their masters down--or wage war against them!",Surrogates
76,buiger,What will the future look like? ... Maybe like this!,6,11 April 2010,"I basically agree with Ebert's review on this one. This is definitely only a simple action flick, but it is well made, the acting is decent, the f/x very good, the film is never tacky, boring or overtly see-through. Enough to keep e viewer interested and entertained while lounging on a couch eating popcorn and drinking beer on a Sunday afternoon. What's wrong with that? In addition, it poses a couple of interesting questions about our current and especially future relationship with machines, the morality of it, etc. These questions will become more and more important as each day passes, and even though the movie does not even attempt to analyze or answer them, it is not unimportant to have posed them. A classical, typically Hollywood-ian ending offers no real solutions, all the wrong certainties and faulty answers, albeit populist ones.",Surrogates
77,willcundallreview,A Sci-Fi with a lot of potential,6,21 July 2014,"Surrogates is a Sci-Fi film that although never really lives up to the epic scale we see so often in this genre, still produces some good action scenes and an amazing production design to look at. It has a cast led by an action film legend and he produces bringing the right balance of fights and chases to really make the short film exciting. Some say it is poor but I disagree, I felt it has enough to be considered alright and thought it was also just about OK, and here below is why.The story is pretty cool but to be fair it is wasted, too short of a film and too much going on mean you never quite get to delve into the story and learn about new things. I liked the ending which is interesting and although it does start very slowly and the pace really needs to be kicked up a notch, the middle into the end produces what the movie goers want to see. I also liked the way in which everything works in the world, it is really quite neat and although may seem it has been done before when you see it, it turns out interesting.Bruce Willis is well, a weird looking when he wants to be,He has a strange looking surrogate and the make-up used on him is disturbingly strange to look at best. I wasn't to keen on pretty much anyone else in the cast, it is pretty poorly acted and only Willis can do anything to bring in a saving grace. I would have liked to see the film bring in more support for Willis as at times he can seem to be on his own doing things and a decent sidekick would have made it more exciting.Jonathan Mostow doesn't direct this too well in all fairness, it isn't it's weakest point but the way in which everything goes a long is just a frightfully horrible pace. I personally felt the acting was the biggest let down for this film but the writing is also poor, you won't think much about it whilst watching it but the words chosen are nothing different that your average screenplay. The effects, well the effects are also fairly poor but I will say the actual surrogates look great although basically the sets and make-up for this are the top of quality.The main criticism of course the acting as previously said, just isn't strong enough for such a hard film to well, act in. The poor effects are to be fair hard to do anyway, a bigger budget perhaps would have done the trick but they don't annoy you as a viewer. The 89 minute running time can be a problem at times too, with too little a time to really understand the characters and a rushed ending too.If you like Sci-Fi/Action type films then go see it, you should enjoy all that goes on and only the most hardened haters of Sci-Fi would really dislike this. For Bruce Willis fans your probably used to over the top action and this has it quite a bit although sometimes seems mindless. It's actually a good old mystery if you really look into it and any fan of working out that mystery should enjoy this, even if you don't particularly like these type of movies.Overall it is Just About a Pleasing film, contains no material to push up it's score but I don't think the everyone that watches it should hate it. Don't look into the behind the scenes stuff like writing and directing and the film is hugely enjoyable. Another thing not to look a lot into is also the acting which is not the worst ever but when the film starts you want them to leave the movie quick.",Surrogates
78,rowmorg,Idiotic over-priced rubbish,3,7 January 2012,"This movie with no thought behind it cost $60 million to make, and brought in about half that. In other words, Disney lost about $30 million. What a farce. The whole story is for idiots who believe that the fossil-fuel rave-up will still be going on in the future---huge traffic jams, military vehicles, helicopters uber alles---at a time when everyone has graduated from i-phones to full-blown avatar robots who sit around zapping themselves with electric joy-sticks for fun. This is never going to happen. America is in rapid decline. Traffic will eventually stop, and lifestyles will have to be re-invented. Cities will be dismantled. Freeways will grow crops. Director Mostow ripped off every sci-fi idea available, crammed it all into 89 minutes, and let it rip. Sadly, the basic idea is so moronic that it could not support a movie, and there was no audience for it. However, it is nevertheless a better product that Fox's ""Aliens v. Predators"", which is not saying much. Watch ""District 9"" as see what can be done for one-third the price.",Surrogates
79,richard_sleboe,Virtual morality,2,1 February 2010,"There's nothing here that you haven't seen ten years ago, and better, in ""Matrix"" or ""Existenz"". Add two measures of ""Terminator"" and one of ""Minority Report"", and you've got ""Surrogates"". The plot is all quick fix with no substance. In one scene, cutting off human operators from their surrogates makes them freeze in mid-motion. In another scene, the surrogates keep walking unimpaired even after the connection is severed. This may seem like a minor glitch, but it turns out that this is exactly what the movie is supposed to be all about. Tough luck. The fine cast gets next to no chance to explore the conflict between real life and surrogate life, and seems wasted on the script. The one interesting, if unintentional twist is the fact that human extras are playing robots playing humans.",Surrogates
80,gary-444,Bland Bluster,3,21 October 2009,"Big budgets and sci-fi tend to be uneasy bedfellows, and so it proves here.The idea, of surrogate robots ""living"" human lives for them is a decent one, and touches on ground explored in ""I Robot"", ""Westworld"" and ""Total Recall"". The cast is strong built around the dependable Bruce Willis.But disappointingly the Studio and Director Jonathan Mostow are content to allow the film to run as strictly formulaic big-budget fare.Car chases, a crash which reprises the seminal ""Dirty Harry"" fire hydrant scene, helicopter chases and choreographed crowd scenes are all presented forensically and as dispassionately as a robot artificial intelligence.Mostow has an interesting background.As Director of T3, he showed a command of mega bucks productions and futuristic CGI, as executive producer of ""The Game"" he showed an understanding of how to tell a good story. Neither talent is much in evidence here.The characters are underwritten, and the story itself, of ""rogue robots gone bad"" lacks drama with a bizarre ending.Normally I praise a 90 minute running time, in this instance it appears that they simply gave up after an hour and a half.If you like a blaring soundtrack to artificially create drama and sanitised chase sequences then this will suit just fine.But an ""alternative"" encampment, directly lifted from""Escape From New York"" which Mostow is in the middle of remaking is risible and there is little else to amuse and entertain, certainly not the script which is about as functional as it is possible to imagine.A missed opportunity.",Surrogates
81,jose-cruz53,Decent film for sci fi fans,6,3 October 2012,"I found this film to be quite decent. The best thing about it was the interesting premise but the execution was mediocre at best. The premise was that in the not-so-far future people will use robotic avatars to live their lives instead of physically coming out of home they would operate their avatars in their pajamas all day long. But since none of the characters are really good and they fell like the stereotyped Hollywood type characters.The conclusion was a standard cliché Hollywood ending, with the politically correct decision taken (spoilers alert): Bruce Willis choose to destroy the ""avatars"" and make people live ""normal"" lives.",Surrogates
82,tburke85,Surrogates An Okay Sci-Fi Action Thriller But With Flaws,4,14 February 2010,"Surrogates is an okay sci-fi action thriller but with flaws that weigh it down. Director Jonathan Mostow is decent in making Surrogates but this isn't his best film. Bruce Willis is all right as Tom Greer who lives in a futuristic world where humans live in isolation and interact through surrogate robots. Willis' character Greer must leave home for the first time in years in order to investigate the murders of other's surrogates putting his own life on the line. Willis does what he can but this isn't his best performance. The same can go for Radha Mitchell, Rosmand Pike, and James Cromwell who shows up for brief appearances but even their talent seem to be wasted in this movie. Ving Rhames is just plain odd in a small role of a man known as The Prophet and the rest of the cast are okay but no one stands out. The action is so-so but you can tell most of it is CG. I preferred the exhilarating action sequences in Batman Begins or The Dark Knight to name a few because they felt for the most part very realistic, fast-paced, and not something made up in a computer. There isn't a whole lot of character development which also weighed it down besides Willis. The dialog wasn't the greatest at times either and the interesting but weak story didn't help but only made it worse. Overall I was disappointed with Surrogates but to be honest I wasn't expecting that much which is saying something right there. Surrogates has some so-so action, a little drama, and decent performances but even those things can't hide it's flaws. If you're looking for a good sci-fi action adventure I suggest you see the new Star Trek or Transformers because they're at least entertaining with a few minor flaws but the good outweighed the bad which is more than I can say for Surrogates because when this movie was over it left me feeling disappointed.",Surrogates
83,Jay_Exiomo,A beta version of you,5,25 September 2009,"Calling ""Surrogates"" mechanical may be too obvious but there's no getting around the fact that this sci-fi saga about androids taking the place of humans in the outside world is a lackadaisical effort. An adaptation of Robert Venditti and Brett Weldelethe's graphic novel, Jonathan Mostow's dystopian yarn aims to be a thinking man's blockbuster a la cinematic translations of Philip K. Dick's works, using moral dilemmas to decorate its main mystery, but succeeds only insofar as it at least keeps things sporadically entertaining when it abandons deeper issues for requisite extravaganza.After the U.S. Supreme Court has voted to approve an alternate world introduced by a flustered inventor (James Cromwell), society has instantly embraced ""surrogates,"" human-like robots attached to the brains of an ""operator."" Thus, Tom Greer, a haggard fed who can barely stand up, can look like a creepily unsullied Bruce Willis in perpetually diffused lighting and chase an accused murderer like a triathlete in steroids. But an anti-surrogates coalition led by Ving Rhames' ""The Prophet"" has been staging a protest over what they claim as an abomination of nature, and whether coincidence or not, an operator was killed when its surrogate was blasted by a classified weapon. The unprecedented incident throws law enforcers -- all surrogates as well -- into turmoil, putting them in a race against time to solve the murder case before someone does a surrogate genocide.John Brancato and Michael Ferris' run-of-the-mill screenplay regularly conks out every time it feigns interest in shaping Greer's character through a traumatic past and a distant wife, mauling the point on humanity's distorted view through canted camera angles and simplistic moralizing. Mostow sporadically supplies the proceedings with wee bit of genuine tension, though his latest craft lacks the awesome factor that heightened the wonderment of his yet another robots-meet-humans film ""Terminator 3."" A character claims that the world has forgotten how to experience life, perhaps alluding to this clunk of cipher that's perfectly satisfied to play safe and play dead.",Surrogates
84,Jerique,Sign Me Up For Surrogacy!,8,22 January 2010,"Once again, Bruce Willis shines in another epic performance as the world's hero. In another movie with machines (see I, Robot), James Cromwell once again takes charge as the ""father of change."" I was gripped by this movie right from the start. It seems very similar to I, Robot mixed with Gamer. Naturally, the plot twists are something that add so much more to an already alluring plot with massive action packed into it.I was surprised at the end credits to see Radha Mitchell as Peters when I believed it to be Amber Valletta the entire time. It might have been my subconscious playing a trick on me as Amber played that style of role in Gamer.I was shocked at the end as all the plot twists came together and revealed themselves. I enjoyed every minute of the monstrous roller coaster, and I thought it was very well written and directed.I would definitely use surrogates if they were real entities. That's the mark of a great movie isn't it? To wish it were real? I believe so. Definitely highly recommended.",Surrogates
85,virindra,Was O.K.,6,26 October 2009,"I had hight expectations about this movie. I like Willis in action movies, although he wants to focus himself on comedy-movies. My advice; don't. Action movies with Willis in it are the best! Willis is the one who carries the whole movie. James Cromwell is very boring. In the most of his movies he performs in characters who are all alike.The concept about the surrogates is great. The special effects etcetera are great as well. But during the movie questions rise about could it be real what you are seeing (with in the mind that the whole idea of a surrogate could be real).The concept is a little bit stolen from the concept ""Second life"" on the internet. You can be who you want to be and live your life just in your chair behind your computer. So this movie is (in my opinion) just a little step forward, making this idea a little bit more over the top.The end where the plug is pulled out was a little bit lame. It was not the cherry on the pie. At the end I had the feeling; ""Right... hmmm... I'm hungry"". I saw Die hard 4 last week. The whole movie was action packed. At the end of that movie I had the feeling; ""WOW! Again!""",Surrogates

87,Rabh17,Entertaining yes-- but the concept failed to 'Gel',6,2 May 2010,"I decided to wait for this movie to come out via Netflix instead of renting via iTunes and I'm glad I waited.Like I noted above-- This movie is entertaining--BUT I had a hard time accepting the reality it put forward. The notion of everyday life being replaced by tele-operated robot look-alikes while people lay at home jacked-in. . .but still riding the trains, driving cars, going to parties, walking down the street, getting dressed and changing clothes. I just couldn't ACCEPT it. When I thought about it outside of the action on the screen, I found myself forgetting about Bruce Willis and the action on the screen and muttering: ""But I can't even IMAGINE this making sense!"" At which point the movie goes into Pause mode and I have to get back into a mood of 'Wilful Acceptance' enough to watch again.Oddly enough, as a Graphic Novel, I COULD take the concept in stride, because the act of going thru a graphic novel would have focused on the technology and the crime-- in this case the ability of a weapon to fry both the robotic surrogate and the jacked-in user in his home.The problem is that a movie is an attempt to paint a worldwide picture as believable while a Graphic Novel focuses singularly on the concept within a partition of a make-believe reality.The rest of the movie did exactly what the creators wanted-- The Overtly Plasticine/mannequin looks of the surrogates were pointedly juxtaposed against the decrepit looking users laying in their link couches-- and the message there is clear that this technology is NOT Necessarily a GOOD thing. . .But even that was lost to me in the plain, unavoidable ABSURDITY of the whole concept.I contrast 'Surrogates' with 'I, Robot' and 'Minority Report' Both of those movies dealt with the posited notion of the world and society changed fundamentally by a technology that eventually went wrong.But the notion of the world and society allowing the notion of Crime Prevention and Incarceration by Precognition of Future Bad Acts-- or a world where people had the chance to buy a Robot slave/assistant only to find out that the controlling computer is Evil isn't too far fetched from normal Human Wants and Desires.But the idea of buying a robot that looks like you-- and doing all the normal things you do anyway, thru the robot. . .I just can't buy it. And thus, I can't buy into 'Surrogates' the way the creators wanted me to.Rent this one. Don't Buy.",Surrogates
88,RichardSRussell-1,"""The Machine Stops"" a Century Later",7,28 September 2009,"Surrogates (R, 1:48) — SF, 2nd string, crossoverIt's been a century since E. M. Forster wrote the classic SF short story ""The Machine Stops"", but its theme of human isolation and alienation continues to be relevant in the 21st Century.Some updating must be expected, of course. Where Forster contemplated a world of navel- gazing academics communicating among each other only to exchange critiques of summaries of analyses of synopses of reviews of dim-past original works, the graphic novel by Robert Venditti and Brett Weldele (on which the film is based) envisioned a different pastime for a world full of hermits isolated in their individual chambers. Gone are the spartan scholars' cubicles, replaced by lush apartments and glistening offices. Gone is the introspection, in favor of giddy, active, colorful lifestyles. Gone are the computer-channeled messages as the primary means of human contact; now people interact via their surrogates, essentially remote-controlled androids. The one constant is the central control machine, which of course is also the common achilles' heel of both of these narcissistic, almost solipsistic societies.Surrogates can be made strong, fast, durable, and coordinated, so nobody chooses anything else. Needless to say, they're also all stunningly beautiful. And, because violence against a surrogate does no damage whatsoever to its operator, their 90% market penetration (in only 14 years) has resulted in the virtual elimination of crime.Into this halcyon picture creeps a note of disquiet. A pair of ""surreys"" has been fried in a particularly nasty way, and the eyebrow-raiser for FBI Agent Tom Greer (Bruce Willis) and his partner Jennifer Peters (Radha Mitchell) is that the robots' operators met their ends at exactly the same time, brains liquified in the skulls, a form of biofeedback that bodes ill for the technology. Their boss, Agent in Charge Andy Stone (Boris Kodjoe) directs them to pursue the case without blurting its implications all over the media, lest it cause a panic (and, not incidentally, a financial whack for Virtual Self Inc., the megacorp that monopolizes the market).In the police procedural that follows, we discover that not everybody is enamored of surrogates. Notable among the opponents are the Human Coalition, led by The Prophet (Ving Rhames), which has convinced the government to guarantee it semi-autonomous ""reservations"", free not only of surrogates but most kinds of machines. Less extreme than these latter-day luddites but more influential is Dr. Lionel Canter (James Cromwell), the genius who invented surrogates in the 1st place but who got bounced from VSI by his business partners after he became disillusioned with the results. It turns out that one of the murder victims was his son Jarid, and therein lies the detectives' 1st lead.Surrogates has more of the intellectual and emotional content that Gamer (4) didn't even aspire to, particularly the subplot in which Greer hasn't been in the actual physical presence of his wife Maggie (Rosamund Pike) since shortly after their son was killed. But it also ignores some of the techie details (like radio shadows, transmission lag times, and limited bandwidth) that Gamer, for all its mindless violence, at least mentioned. Willis does a nice job of conveying the uncertainty and anxiety that accompany the induced agoraphobia he's experiencing after years of going abroad only in the persona of his surrogate (also played by Willis, with tons of makeup and a weird-looking blond wig).There are a number of morals to the story, not least of which are paying due respect to the virtues of decentralization and off-site backup.Not in the same class as ""The Machine Stops"" primarily because its core premise can no longer be completely original, Surrogates nonetheless provides a nice modern gloss on that base. Good, solid SF, not great, but worth seeing.",Surrogates

Now the average red blooded U.S. soldier can now fight on the front lines all the whilst nice and cozy and safe in his army barracks using his humanoid replicant and operating him in a sorta game console. 14 years later the surrogate idea is now main frame and affordable with 98% of the American public owning one or two of them.

90,honorhorror,A thoughtful execution on a spoiled topic.,7,27 October 2009,"People will hate it, the critics will hate it. When both hated it, most probably I will too, but I don't. Ratherly, I'd give some nods to Surrogates.With a 54-year-old Bruce Willis, a sci-fi story you probably have heard of a hundred times, Surrogates don't seem, sound interesting at all. The trailer had some excitements, and Willis' traumatic face also was the reason that I saw it.There are still tons of reasons to hate it when I was watching it in the theater, that the special effects are all out of their places, sometimes you can even tell how far was the actor standing from the blue-screen when they shot it. Also, the interactions between Willis and his wife were all melodramas that slowed the pace of actions. Blah Blah Blah......But the movie worked, and on several layers. The plot line, although not so expanded, was really carefully executed with subtlety in each scene and details. Every rubber-like, young and ""perfect"" surrogate mirrors its aging, weight-gaining, dying master, who rejected his/her real life to some certain degree. The entire feeling of a dystopia society kept its energy to the last scene in a relatively satisfying way. The ending, which everyone hated, was actually acceptable and not the cliché I expected, and if you think about it a little bit, you will know the messages the director wanted to send are explicit and relevant to us. Yet, the pace and the action were kept on a balance generally.In fact, I don't know why people would expect it to be another Sci-fi classic, and was in such a hurry bashing it at all. It's supposed to be entertaining and thoughtful, and yes it is. Maybe this topic and genre had been well spoiled over the years, but let me say give it a chance.7/10.",Surrogates
91,Siamois,Decent entertainment...,4,13 December 2009,"Surrogates is a modern take on ideas that have been floating around in speculative fiction for a long while. Ideas that became even more widespread during the Cyberpunk movement of the 80s. As presented, it unfortunately feels very dated. The movie is a very classic ""whodunnit"" mystery, taking place in a future where human shut themselves in and live their lives through surrogates. Unfortunately, neither aspects of the film (the plot or this speculative world) are terribly grasping. Most of the characters feel like rough sketches, with the exception of detective Tom Greer (Willis). Even Greer is underdeveloped not to mention extremely cliché. The whole murder mystery makes you feel like you're going from point A to B to C and so on. It makes it hard to care for anyone dying or any character's motivations. Once you get to the big reveal, you're just going ""uh huh"".Where this movie attempted to shine I feel is in its context. Unfortunately, there again it fails. As I've said earlier, the idea that people might become slaves to technology and experience life through some kind of ""proxy"" has been around for a long time. We've seen in other works. Recent cinematic examples being Gamers or the very popular Matrix trilogy not to mention tons of literature and anime movies. Somehow, Surrogates with its hyper lifelike ""robots"" continuing to deplete the Earth's resource seems like an unwieldly concept. All the technology, engineering and power required for actual physical surrogates would be draining on society and the benefits, compared to a virtual surrogate in a virtual world are nil. What's more, even if we buy in the world as depicted by this movie, it simply isn't fleshed out enough with the potential use and abuse of surrogates for us to really get engrossed. Even the movie Gamers, which is basically a violent cartoon, was more successful in showing us many aspects of such a world.Surrogates also suffer from a cardinal sin of slow-moving science-fiction movie. With its slow pace, all the holes in a science are glaring. USB keys? Not with that level of technology. Almost nil crime rate and zero murders? Unexplained and unbelievable in this context. Connection between operator and surrogate? Unexplained and we don't buy it. Operator brains that explode? Ridiculous. If this was an action flick and this world was just a canvas on which violent scenes are depicted, with bullets flying all around, these holes would be forgivable as we are entertained. This is not the case. Giving it a 4 because it didn't bore me to death. The special effects, acting, action scenes... everything is decent. Making it a decent movie.",Surrogates
92,ltlacey,"In the future humans need never leave their homes but are able to ""live"" vicariously through robotics.",5,8 May 2010,"Surrogates is not a bad movie, but it is not that good of a movie either. Just another ho-hum movie, in a growing number of mediocre movies, and with a very predictable storyline, characters, and action. Like reading off of a flowchart. Premise: Humans have developed robots to take their place in every day life while they stay at home, linked to their surrogate, lounging in some comfy chair or bed (wouldn't they get fat and their muscles atrophy?), and experience life through the robot. All aspects of one's life are lived through a robot, and we get this, and even before the movie really begins. Almost immediately we felt like we were watching a cross between I, Robot (and not just because Cromwell was in it) and the feel of The Island. There was nothing new here. MAJOR SPOILER COMING: We did have a question nagging us the entire time throughout the movie: If all humans lived through their surrogates why was the young man who died when his surrogate was killed off at college? Wouldn't he just attend college through his surrogate? Too many holes in this one, and the F/X really was not that spectacular.",Surrogates
93,pontram,"Easy to see, easy to forget",6,16 January 2010,"I have - opposed to others here - the impression that this movie is not deeper than Gamers. The social aspects are mainly reduced to alienation between husband and wife. The rest is a detective story in standard mode, framed by the SF environment. Thats all. No real conflicts about the life of those who cannot pay the price for the luxury or are suffering because the usage of surrogates. People are going their way on the streets and in the offices. The air is clean of any cruelty, like, say, in Soylent Green. Actually, the people living without surrogates are driven by envy and simple hatred against the others, and the movie raises their ""natural"" way of life - being in a ghetto and ruled by Mobsters like the Prophet - to something preferable. Whith which right do they judge their fellow citizens ? I also waited unrewarded for an explanation how the operators survive their daily immobility. I think if so many people lie in their beds the whole day long and do nothing than live through their surrogates, they would all die on muscular atrophy, not to mention fatty degeneration and other diseases.There are several questionable moments, f.i. when Tom is eye-scanned (for what purpose do you eye-scan a robot ?) or why cell phones are being used. When Tom is talking to the Colonel about the weapon, the bruises in his face, which he got during his confrontation with the Prophet before, are very small. Later they are bigger again.Unfortunately Surrogate's director is the same of Terminator 3, and I don't think, that is a good movie. I don't know how he got Surrogates, but for a top-level production, like it was thought, he wasn't on the right place. On the other hand, Bruce was on the right place (for us), and I enjoyed seeing him with a special mask to make him 20 years younger, but not able or willing to move any parts of his face except the eyes (like a real cool detective). And later, the contrast to his aged face - he is a lucky one.I gave it 6 stars, maybe it deserves one more, but it's yet too sloppy.",Surrogates
94,dmuel,could have been so much better,5,11 November 2009,"Here was one great idea for a sci-fi movie which falls flat on its face despite a good cast, quality special effects and nice layouts. The story tells of the near future when advances in technology allow people to live their lives in robotic bodies, where they can be young again and basically have no fear of harm or injury. FBI officer Willis is assigned to look into a case where it appears that someone has devised a way to kill the living humans through an attack on their robotic shells. The first 30 minutes are so intriguing! Aside from this new threat, what sort of problems might this new type of life present? Would there be social problems incidental to the new technology? The movie makes a threadbare attempt to address these ideas, and ends up a big disappointment for considering them in the first place. Some interesting characters are introduced but then arbitrarily cast aside without any satisfactory exploration. At 88 minutes, this movie could have benefited from some creative screen writing, character development, and plot construction. Unfortunately, a movie that could have been quite a sci-fi hit ends up screeching into B-movie history. How sad!",Surrogates
95,dusan-22,Well ...,4,19 February 2010,"This movie is interesting with no doubt. Intelligent view on our near future, someone would probably say; I say - this is what our present time look like. Our surrogates today are our computer screens that we use as our senses or life operating instruments when it comes to many things. In many ways they are becoming our convenient shields from all life difficulties as they are making our lives easier. They cannot perform our sexual intercourse yet, but can do everything prior to that. The consequences are left to be anticipated and for that reason - I consider this movie pretty interesting. However, the one could work much better on the plot development which is pretty dull and mediocre. If the surrogates look like people, their characters could have been developed more carefully involving us in the plot as well and not only the technological twists. All in all, worth of seeing.",Surrogates
96,deastman_uk,No money for Bruce,4,17 October 2009,"I'll settle on Sixth Day crossed with I, Robot being the films this ends up feeling most like. Without the quality and acting. Yeah, I know. But I can't be bothered to talk more about the plot as its just shabby.More interesting is the lack of production skills on this film. Bar a few scenes (yes, the ones on the trailer), Surrogates has a made for TV feeling much of the time. The outside lighting looked odd, the interior shots often seemed badly framed. Somehow, this film either lost money in production or maybe never had much.Bruce wanders around looking lost in his own flick; if he chooses projects this well maybe its time to give up. Ving Rhymes may also want to choose parts a little more sensibly.Wheras District 9 didn't know what to do with itself, this one seems to have hit the ground dead. Even the sentimentality was bad - and Bruce can normally deliver that.There are certain types of film that can work in 90 minutes - this is not the sort. Even stinkers like the Island understood that time is needed to generate the world view for a sci-fi film.But it probably comes down to money, sadly. A film like this is all about execution - and this should just have been executed.",Surrogates
97,trans_mauro,Man Against Machine,1,19 October 2009,"Yes, another of those films preaching about the evils of technology and industry and praising the beauty of the human soul.... Yeah, right!Now, it is about time those artsy director, writers and whoever learn that what has made human life bearable is technology. Even the CGI they love so much is 100% technology. Without it, we would still be naked, living in caves and eating raw meat. Technology and science are the great equalizers. Human condition began to improve with the Industrial Revolution. Curiously, the ones that really mess up with the human race are those against the ""Machine"": religious leaders, communists, socialists and other fundamentalists that abhor technology, progress, access to information and freedom of choice.Now about the film itself: If we put aside the plot holes, the stupidity of the surrogate concept, the film is barely passable, the story has an obvious conclusion and except for Bruce Willis' character, everybody else in no more than a, well, robotic face. The Prophet guy is atrociously ridiculous. Actions scenes are the usual run-of-the-mill: a few chases, a few fights. Special effects are kept to a minimum. It is a minor and forgettable film.",Surrogates
98,pepekwa,more questions than answers,8,13 July 2010,"I'm a big fan of futuristic movies with an idea of what our society could look line in x years from now. The idea of humans having surrogates is very avatar-like and has enough potential to spawn a TV series. The first few minutes of this movie attempted to explain how this situation arose but then developed into a crime drama with the whole surrogacy issue more of a sub-plot.This movie was woefully short and is one of those movies where a 2 1/2 hour running time would be justified it it was going to weave in some key points about surrogates. The concept is superb and because this movie was over too quickly, there are too many questions marks and thought's of what may have been.I can see this being remade on a larger scale in the future with more nuances and ideas from this movie developed.",Surrogates
99,MovieProductions,"I wish I had a surrogate, so he can watch this movie, and not I",4,7 July 2010,"*1/2 out of (****)""Surrogates"" looked like a well-crafted thriller judging by its advertisements. My interest was peeked so high, until I saw that this movie was not screened for critics. I decided I was going to the opening weekend and go with an open mind. It turns out, I can see why the studio made that decision. This movie, in brief, is simply awful. From the uneven direction to the bland performances, this movie's redemption factor is ridiculously low. With no inventive concepts floating around in Hollywood, it was refreshing to see a unique concept. It turns out that an atypical premise does not exactly meet the merit of a decent film. I was not only letdown by this mediocrity because it simply wasn't well-made, but also because it's even below average. ""Surrogates"" revolves around the idea of humans looking to get surrogates of themselves. Surrogates are advertised as human-like creations but with flawless skin, a high risk reducer of damage to the body, and all around more pleasing. What the public doesn't know is that surrogates can be fatal. There are more twists and turns in the story, but won't go more in- depth since this is a spoiler-free review.First of all, the performances are simply weak. With the exception of Bruce Willis, the actors seemed lifeless, like energy was drained out of them. They didn't showcase their fullest abilities and seem two dimensional. Moreover, the direction is very uneven. What starts off as a promising thriller, then delves into a ""been-there-done-that"" esquire thriller that recycles clichés from several action pictures. Furthermore, the film can be very tedious at times, with the camera panning at the same shot for approximately two minutes. Also, for this being marketed as an action picture, action was definitely lacking. Any violence that was portrayed was surrogates vs. humans combat. Additionally, without giving anything away, the film has many plot holes, which surprisingly, are heavily blatant.While this film suffers from huge drawbacks, there are a few redemptions. First off, the cinematography is very cool and the special effects are also authentic. Moreover, Bruce Willis gave a good performance and the beginning was pretty intriguing.Overall, ""Surrogates"" is the type of movie where you watch to kill a few hours on a lonely Saturday night with nothing else to do. It's easily forgettable, not redeeming in many ways, and simply uneven. This movie is always interesting, but it's never involving, which is its main drawback. Surrogates is simply a disappointment.",Surrogates
100,tubby1,Commercial intelligence,7,13 February 2010,"Surrogates is a sci-fi film which has the feel of an audience pleasing action-thriller and a touch of thematic quality that propels it too a more satisfactory experience even if it is rather cliché and formulaic.The premise is intriguing and paints a picture of the future which one could foresee. Humans remain at home and in their place are 'surrogate' robotic creations which the humans have complete control of and who perform all their everyday activities in the outside world. Without going into too much detail the event the film relies on to propel the story is rather unoriginal but a necessary tool to up-the-ante and provide its talking points.The introduction to Surrogates is good at setting the scene of this future world but it misses a finesse, or a quality, it settles for a more commercialised feel. Indeed this is the precedent that the film sticks too - there are a number of shoot-outs and car chases. Mixed into this we have the concept itself that is of natural interest, which is aided by the reasonable special effects and the highly impressive makeup and technical work.The two female characters in Surrogates are played by Radha Mitchell and Rosamund Pike two very good actresses who impress, although the film does not stretch their talents. Bruce Willis is at home in this thriller/sci-fi as Tom Greer an FBI agent caught up in the startling revelation. Willis's performance is played in the right spirit and with the necessary intensity to provide Greer with a connection to the audience. The only performer, who seemed out of place was Ving Rhames sporting a rather funny hairstyle, and looking ill-at-ease. This I would also put down to his character 'The Prophet' who is the failure of the film, he screams of stereotypical design.Surrogates was made to entertain and it does do this well. The story is straightforward enough and has a nice twist, without being too challenging. Surrogate does what it needs to be a satisfactory viewing and although the script is rather Hollywoodesque it has enough of a concept to be that little bit more.",Surrogates

It is kind of like Blade Runner meets the Sims Game. All in all this movie was worth watching with no regrets. Special effects do not need to be spectacular but I liked the way they made Bruce Willis look young. The movie could have had more boom. Would have been nice to have more scenes of Sims going to war, could have been a cool opportunity for my terminator vs your terminator. And the movie lost a chance to connect by not showing more of back story of Wilis and wife Maggie character, played by the beautiful Rosamund Pike. Story had a few plot holes but none were glaring.It would say it is worth discount ticket or renting.",Surrogates
102,rebecca-ry,Disappointing,6,30 September 2012,"I was really looking forward to this film but it was a little bit disappointing. The performances were basic but you could argue that because most of the performers were supposed to be playing surrogate robots so they may have done this deliberately. Bruce Willis was pretty good here but his character didn't have enough depth for you to genuinely care about him.The plot is really interesting and does carry the film. It's a really interesting take on the idea of technology taking over our lives in the not-so distant future. There are some great effects and action sequences here but it all falls a bit flat when it comes to dialogue. It's a bit ironic that a story about machines overwhelming human life and emotions lacks heart. The climax didn't evoke enough emotion as it should have done to properly explain its point! Overall, the film does have some really good action sequences but that's about it. Bruce Willis has certainly got a lot better sci-fi films under his belt than this, such as 'Twelve Monkeys' or 'The Fifth Element'. I suggest you watch one of these films instead of 'Surrogates'.",Surrogates
103,pepe4u22,Wonderful movie but left me wanting more,6,9 February 2011,A terrific movie with an interesting premise. In the future people are replaced by surrogates who live our lifes for us. Bruce Willis plays an FBI agent and he gets involved in a murder of the creator of the surrogate world. Well as usual nothing appears as it seems and Bruce is our man to solve the mystery. I found the movie's pacing somewhat slow and a couple of red herrings too many but the premise was so interesting that it kept my attention. Bruce Willis gives his typical everyday man hero performance which only he can do and why i personally enjoy his movies. The supporting actors are good some sharper pacing and better editing may have made this more fun but a good action movie but i just wanted more.,Surrogates
104,Pingo-2,Made by people who doesn't understand technology.,4,2 February 2010,"SURROGATES is a cliché ridden film based on the idea that we sometime in the future will have robots doing our dirty work. In this film, however, every person is in their bed controlling their robot's daily life. A completely stupid idea since that's not how and why robots are made. Why not an AI for simple tasks? Would people really like to lie in the bed and do boring stuff every day? Where's the fun in that? The plot roams around a boring conspiracy. Boring, since there are too few characters in this mess to make the conspiracy work. You'll figure it out after a few minutes, and after that, the only thing that will keep you awake is the incredible make-up and the not-so-incredible action-scenes.Actors are ""good"", but not perfect. Bruce Willis is OK, but hey - it's Bruce Willis. The rest - well, I didn't really care. Because the movie doesn't make you care.And that's sad, because the basic idea here with robots that we can send out to do our daily life - that is a GREAT idea! Sadly, the writers messed it up. But what do you expect from the creators of CATWOMAN and THE NET? It's pretty obvious that these writers LOVE technology - but they don't understand it. They take what they see on the surface, tries to make it their own ideas - but misses the point.SURROGATES is one of those movies that will pass and become forgotten, along with TIME WALKER (1982). It's OK if you can watch it for free somewhere - especially since the make-up is always in Uncanny Valley.The rest of the film however, is simply boring.",Surrogates
105,lopcar1993,"Interesting movie, but ultimately falls too short of it's premise",5,23 October 2009,"I've seen movies like this before. Many times before The Matrix, I Robot, Minority Report, The Terminator. The list goes on, while this film lacks originality in the main focal point of the plot it does give a very nice and enjoyable spin on an old tale.Surrogates is a highly entertaining but ultimately flawed movie due to it's reliance on formula. But it's idea is solid and it's execution is very thought out. So why id it that this film fell flat on it's face? Well there are three good reasons for it: 1.) It' story while entertaining and fresh has been done far too many times before to count. 2.) it's heavy on the action and look and feel of the film but the film crew throw out the idea of giving this movie a well written script and thought that action and eye candy could save it from being a failure, but sad to say it didn't. 3.) The wooden acting from most the cast really brings down the film's production value and makes this almost hard to watch. But if your forgiving and can get over the lousy acting by most of the supporting cast, then I can promise you that this film will give you a good, high tech thrill ride.Bruce Willis(Who's done way, way better than this.) Gives one of the least impressive performances in a long time, he's so wooden and bland in this it's almost funny when he speaks, but I don't blame him(I blame the lousy directing and script.) Willis tries so hard to really up the appeal of this film but sorry to say he falls short thanks to a terrible supporting cast and there bad acting. Rhada Mitchell(who is my least favorite actress.) is one of the main weak links in this film she really brings down the film and also drags Willis with her. She was really wooden and emotionless(Which is no surprise there she's a terrible actress.) But I think without her this film could have at least stayed a float a little better than it did. But all in all the cast does hold up fairly well under the poor script and bad direction.Surrogates is nothing groundbreaking or earth shattering. It's a run of the mill Sci-FI action thriller that has an extraordinarily intriguing premise that if it was not mired down by, like I said, bad dialogue and poor direction this would have been a top notch film. But none the less it settles for alright. And I can tell you that if your very, very forgiving and kind than this film will give you your money's worth.",Surrogates

As for the rest of the cast, they were good too, I don't want to say more because their are some good twists in this.Overall a straightforward average cyber-crime thriller, but I honestly liked it.

108,EchoMaRinE,not something like Matrix but still good,9,27 February 2010,"The movie is based on a very nice idea: people starting to use robot surrogates to interact instead of their own body. In time, this becomes such a normal thing that almost everyone starts using surrogates and disconnects himself from the real life. A series of surrogate murders reveals the fact that things are not as good as they look. The story is bright, directing is good, the acting is good and overall performance is quite good. It is not something like Matrix though. Despite the brightness behind the idea, there are small things that prevents the movie to be a master piece. To begin with, the idea of surrogates is not as natural as the idea in Matrix. A lot of people can not afford computers, how on earth they buy an expensive piece of robot. In addition, by just sitting at home, you would die in a few months because of high cholesterol or something like that. Human beings are supposed to move. Also, you can not control all surrogates from the same room (somebody needs a crash course on mathematics it seems). To make the long story short, nice movie that you wouldn't regret watching especially if you like science fiction but don't expect a master piece.",Surrogates
109,J_Trex,Excellent Sci-Fi Flick with Great Action Sequences,8,28 September 2009,"This film was an interesting twist on the robot as human concept, with a plot that managed to keep the viewer interested right up until the dramatic ending. A high tech company has specialized in mass producing surrogates, or personal robots, which are sold to the American middle class. They are quickly adopted to perform routine functions and then essentially perform high level functions (like one's job). The main theme was how the surrogates assumed people's lives and identities to such an extent the flesh & blood owner of the surrogate could stay home and presumably pursue higher level interests. The reality was most people simply fell into a spiritual stupor, resorting to alcohol or drugs to pass their time. The actors were all very good and up to the task of portraying themselves in robotic fashion (this doesn't require great acting skill but the screenplay was quite good). I thought Bruce Willis did a good job in the lead role(s) as FBI Agent Tom Geer (he also played his ""surrogate"" as a very low key robot). Bruce's surrogate is investigating the death of the son of the founder of the corporation that invented and produced the surrogates. This kicked off the main plot, which centered around an armed resistance group opposed to surrogates and attempting to defeat the surrogates and the corporation that produced them.If the plot sounds confused, at times it is, and the ending may be less than satisfying. But for a far fetched sci-fi movie about robots, this was one of the better ones I've seen.",Surrogates
110,brownah18,Surrogates,8,13 October 2009,"This movie does seem a lot like the movie I-Robot except your missing Will Smith and some of the other actors in that movie. This movie is about Surrogates, people who control these Robots that look like themselves but are able to do whatever they want from the safety inside their home. Starring Bruce Willis, Radha Mitchell, Rosamund Pike, and James Cromwell who you probably remember from I-Robot. Kind of funny in a way to see him doing another Robot movie but he does a good job when being a character in them. This is Bruce's second time doing a movie that is Sci-Fi, his other one was The Fifth Element. You might remember that movie will Milla Jovavich. After discovering there is a weapon that can kill you when your controlling your surrogate, Bruce and Mitchell team up and try to figure out who has the weapon and who hired him to do the job. Bruce Willis has always been one of my favorite actors. After doing the Die Hards i did not know what else to ask from him. In this movie he does so great in only expands his acting career even though he is getting older and probably wont be able to do all his own stunts. Im looking forward on seeing him again sometime soon in the future. Radha Mitchell which i remember her from her role in Man on Fire has expanded her career so much and has done a great job in this movie. Hoping this movie lands her in another great role for her, it would be good to see her again in another movie. See my Reviews on getthenew.com, thanks ahb.",Surrogates

112,theycallmemrglass,Good Sci Fi concept and a mostly satisfying detective thriller,7,2 January 2010,"Although this movie boasts a great Sci-Fi concept, there are a couple of elements in the setting that is just too flawed even for science fiction. I'll come to those flaws shortly.Having accepted the implausible environment, i.e., a world where 98% of humankind stay at home with their minds plugged into their surrogate robots that they live their life through, the rest of the plot is pretty damn riveting. The mood of the film is more akin to Minority Report and certainly feels like a Philip K Dick narrative. The future depiction is not overly futuristic in technology other than the Surrogates themselves so don't expect a big budget effects ridden movie. Having said that, the Surrogates robotic power makes for a couple of excellent action scenes comparable with the Will Smith vehicle ""I, Robot"".But as usual, it is the awesome Bruce Willis who carries the movie both as surrogate (a disturbingly young look with a frightening wig!) and in human form. Thank god he carries it though because there are hardly any significant supporting characters in the story as it focuses on him most of the time as he investigates a rise in rare human murders. There is just something re-assuring about watching him on screen, regardless of the film quality. Going into the 4th decade since Die Hard, he is still in my view a bona-fide movie star.I said there were flaws in the whole concept. Well, I find it impossible to even speculate the possibility that 98% of humankind will love sitting at home plugging their minds into a surrogate robot that they can live their lives through and let their natural bodies wither away with no exercise or self esteem. It seems they prefer to have sex as robots, and flirt with young women surrogates who may be controlled by an old man or...well you get the gist. The appeal is supposed to be a 99% reduction in crime rate where accidents or crimes against a surrogate does not affect the human host. That concept is too flawed even for science fiction. What is stopping a surrogate from burgling a house killing its human owner for example? I don't knock the concept of surrogates itself, its an excellent one but I don't buy the social environment.All in all this was a very very decent entry in the intelligent Sci-Fi movie library.

Set in the future when Mind control body parts have become retail's next big thing, Willis plays a Cop who through his 'Surrogate' uncovers a web of lies and deceit...OK! Thats quick enough on the synopsis as things obviously change form there as Willis begins to doubt the use of his Borg and wants a human life back - The long and the short moral of the story is how far do we really wish to go with technology before we forget what it is like to be human?and that's really the whole idea... In the story, Mankind has become so used to living through these Virtual Versions of ourselves that everyone more or less has become an addict. Cue Willis back in action hero role as he unplugs and attempts to save everyone from being killed.This is NOT an all action flick, so anyone looking for Willis in true Die Hard Fashion will be disappointed - It's a real thinking man's film. Think about how often you use Facebook and how much your communication with your friends relies on typing on a keyboard instead of picking up a phone and you are going to quickly realise the films intent.Defiantly one I would watch again, and one I would even like my kids to see if just to make them think about how much of a life they are missing , speaking of which - I have spent enough time watching the film now, So I am going to take a walk outside and get absolutely soaking wet...

The point of surrogates is that you can live the life you want without any risk to yourself. Then a weapon emerges that when fired at a surrogate can kill the person using the surrogate. This makes the whole point of surrogacy obsolete. So a cop, Tom Greer (Bruce Willis), has to investigate these murders.The movie is full of action and excitement and certainly is one of Bruce Willis's best action/thriller films. I would definitely recommend anyone interested in robots, action and thriller movies to watch this one.",Surrogates
117,eyal philippsborn,A generally good film that ends up missing the personal touch It's suppose to advocate,8,13 December 2009,"More often than not, in order to make a semi-reasoned judgment on a film, one needs a frame of reference. The particular movie screening of ""Surrogates"" that I attended was followed immediately by the screening of""Twelve monkeys"", which was a frame of reference to futuristic worlds. Both worlds feature Bruce Willis as the main character and both deal with parallel existences. Sadly, only one of them harnesses the reference potential to its fullest.Officer Tom Greer (Bruce Willis) seemingly chose the best timing to be a cop. The society he lives in, executed a foolproof method to combine the resources of the outside world and the safety of home. The Mechanical beings that the movie bears their name, are Human-looking robots that are physically superior and also way more attractive than us, human weaklings and are used very effectively as a channel through which the humans exercise their mental capacity from the safety and comfort of their own home. The major upside of our super ego dolls is that in the event of a car accident, shooting spree, St. Patrick's day parade or any hazardous event, they obtain the injuries or deaths that human weaklings would have endured so what ended in the past with death or crippling injury, now adds up to a restoration bill from VSI, the Mega-corporation that cashes in on the surrogates.Basically things go quite well. Sure, a group of dissidents, lead by a an eccentric man known only as the prophet (Ving Rhames) create surrogates free compounds and the founder of the company seems reluctant of his own invention but with crime rates at an all time low and anxiety levels of Yoga instructors, the world of attractive, computerized zombies, is seemingly a happy one.One day, though, Officer Greer and his female partner Peters (Radha Mithcell) discover that a demise of a surrogate was accompanied by the actual death of its operator, an event with literally no likelihood of occurring. Armed with that information and aided by a superior Surrogate, officer Greer escapes the plight of his troubled marriage and enters the dilapidating compounds of the dissidents. In the process, he reveals the vulnerability of surrogates, the frowned upon aspirations of their creator (James Cromwell who gives the most, and maybe only noteworthy performance in the movie) and discovers, along with the viewers (who are still human at this point in time) the grotesque world mankind sunk into in the name of technology.The real a parallel world created by technology is a subject so vastly explored in movies it deserves its own Ganre. Whether this movie bare similarities to ""The Matix"" or ""The Island"" are irrelevant. The only relevant question is whether the parallel world depicted in this movie leaves the impression it was designed to leave and is the basic plot the premise of a masterpiece or a mere excuse for CGI.The parallel world in this movie is depicted quite well I must say. The blank faces of the surrogates as they stroll along the streets of an anonymous metropolis (probably, Boston) leave the impression of the lifeless world that became a prison. Where the movie fails to leave the impression is the real world. With a script that occasionally stumbles on clichés and performances that are satisfactory at best , all the movie has to say about the modern day human dwellers is that they are derelicts in comparison to their surrogates.That, my fellow human weaklings, is not a compliment by any means.If you still wonder why I mentioned the screening of Twelve monkeys in the first place, let me explain. Surrogates is engrossing at times, often effective and visually impressive. What lacks in the movie is a spirit that is crucial to accentuate the true added values of the human imperfections. Since most of the human characters lack depth and the scenes they take part in, are short of subtlety, the movie becomes, well, the product of a surrogate. Some of you might suggest that this is an action flick and not an Oscar movie to begin with but the depiction of the human characters is crucial not only for the academy awards, it's vital to establish the real life from the programmed ones. Twelve monkeys, the futuristic world ridden by a mysterious plague is filled with the highly pretentious and border line hallucinatory direction of Terry Giliam and is hard to watch at times, but Gilliam's approach is the one that makes the characters jagged and frail inside as well as outside. The only observation one could make about the humans in the post-surrogates era is that they are into sweatpants.In an interview Bruce Willis gave to Larry King (add your surrogate related snide remark here), he claimed that he's waiting for action films to re-invent themselves before he re-appears in them. If ""Surrogates"" was suppose to reinvent the genre than quite frankly it didn't but regardless of that, what modern movies are destined to reinvent is not the genre they originate from but the state of mind their viewers should be in. Surrogates provides an entertaining and even semi-intelligent (it is an action flick after all) but like the synthetic world of surrogates, this movie leaves something to be desired.7.5 out of 10 in my FilmOmeter.",Surrogates
118,ticket_for_one,Plays more like a TV series,6,28 September 2009,"This movie was dire, just as I thought it would be. Think I Robot meets Blade Runner and you'll have this pile of trash. Usually when sci-fi movies make it to the big screen you're thinking, this was probably adapted from a Issac Asimov or Phillip K Dick short story. If it was...they'd both be turning in their graves. The movie itself is entertaining in parts boasting some reasonable good set pieces, slow start which eventually picks near the end. The main story and idea for the movie isn't that bad. It was just executed poorly. Plays more like and a TV series than an actually movie. There was a subplot with Willis and his wife that just didn't need to be there, it was straight out of soap opera land. One of the letdowns of the movie Performance wise, Willis does well and continues to be reliable in his role as the main protagonist, Radha Mitchell offers decent support as his android partner and Boris Kodjoe and Ving Rhames are passable in the parts they play. Rosamund Pike bored the hell out of me and James Cromwell was seriously underused. All in all Surrogates is not really a movie in my eyes, just plays out like a TV series, that should've picked up by the Sci-fi Channel years ago. Another big movie letdown. How many more are there to come this year?",Surrogates

The action sequences don't even really hold up, and its not realistic to think everyone would have a surrogate.I didn't care about anyone or anything in this film. I am a Bruce Willis fan and I find that he can usually carry even the most ridiculous and plot less films but he can't even save this mess. I would highly suggest not seeing this film because its incredibly boring and predictable. The acting is poor and there wasn't anything authentic within it.",Surrogates
121,doug-697,This movie could have been SO much better!!,6,2 October 2009,"I decided to comment on this movie, not because it was great, or because it was bad, but because it was so obvious to me how this movie could have been so much better.First, you could enjoy this movie. I did enjoy it. There are some interesting elements and the final moments of the movie are interesting. But you may also be bored by it. For one thing, I could see who was the killer far in advance. And the entire resolution of who the killer was, and why he was killing, left a lot to be desired. I wasn't convinced by his motivation and it wasn't that interesting even if you believe it. The other main problem with the movie was the dialog. There isn't a memorable line in the entire movie. Sometimes directors forget that people do love dialog even in action movies. Remember ""Ho! Ho! Ho! Now I have a machine gun!"" from Die Hard? But the REAL problem with the movie is how they missed some great opportunities with the basic premise. The human element about why people would be motivated to use surrogates was explored, but simply not explored enough. That should have taken up a greater part of the movie instead of the part about the rebellion. I never thought a rebellion could be boring, but it is here.I honestly think, with a bit more thought and effort, this could have been a great movie.",Surrogates

The movie has a good original plot and a good script. However when it comes to action and thrills it fails in most of it. The action is very lame and quite short. The acting is pretty good. Also the movie tries to create suspense for the audience, but this doesn't last long or its just plain obvious. Just like any sci-fi thriller flick, this one gets a fair score since it has a unique script. If you want to see a movie with lot of action and thrills, stay away from this one or at least rent it. However if you want to see a movie with a good plot and a very decent scrip, this a good movie for you.5/10",Surrogates
123,ToddWebb,Basically entertaining,7,26 September 2009,"It's a great concept. In the future, the Sims style online gaming, where people live vicariously through characters, has evolved to living out real-life, in the real world, via surrogate robots. Everybody stays home all the time, 24/7. They work, play and travel via their surrogates, from the comfort of their home.I'm not spoiling anything here -- this all happens in the first 5 minutes. The result of this new era of existence is the dramatic drop in violent crimes, sexually transmitted diseases, death by accident, etc.Well, it's a great concept. And the CGI is good. Because of the plot, every character is insanely pretty, so the screen is filled with beautiful people.But... it just... doesn't... quite... gel. The whole thing feels like a cool episode of Star Trek, or something on TV. The story is not riveting. I didn't really care about the characters. The timing was off; things either came too late (I was bored, expecting them) or so fast I couldn't really appreciate.Surrogates lacks that wow-factor.Example of bad timing: At the start, one wonders, ""What do the users really look like? Anything like like their surrogate robots?"" I would expect that, at first, we see Bruce Willis, just some facial hair which his robot doesn't have. Then, eventually, we see that he is older than his robot, so he's ""cheating"" on age too. Even later still, maybe we'd see an obese person at home posing as an athlete via a surrogate which looks nothing like him. Well, ""Surrogates"" skips all that build up and goes straight for the punchline: within 10 minutes we see a hot chick robot making with a young man; turns out the hot chick is actually slovenly a middle-aged man. Any twists to come later, in this variety, loses all punch.Worth a rental.",Surrogates
124,tripxyde,"GOOD SCI-FI STORYLINE, but not unforgettable",6,25 September 2009,"Surrogates is a sci-fi movie about a future where every human being can connect their bodies into machines & they instantly live a different life through their robotic human-looking surrogates. Anybody can just stay home all day while they are connected online with their surrogates that can just easily live outside in the real world. But when a surrogate was killed along with its user, FBI agent Greer unravels a conspiracy that can lead to the death of billions of lives. The storyline of this movie falls somewhere around the categories where movies like Blade Runner, Minority Report, and I-Robot belong. A movie that talks about how future technologies can affect human life and provide some philosophical point-of-view that is worth pondering on. The idea of technology progressing into and reaching the boundaries that it becomes an abomination of nature. The movie tends to be thought provoking, but does not make it good enough to be worth an entire evening of discussion. There were some moments that seemed preachy, but could have been delivered more effectively if given a proper execution or interpretation. I am talking about the moments when our main character realizes the beauty of a world free from technological complexities. We also have the minor subplot of a corporation just concerned about safeguarding their own products. And a main character coming to the realization that these products eventually diminish the humanity of a person. It is surprising that the weaker point of this movie is the action. The terminator rip-off scenes seemed bland and there was a chase scene with a female surrogate that looked goofy because it employed a ""superhero"" type of action. To make it worse, there are some visual effects that look like they've been rendered 15 years ago. With the main character of Bruce Willis running around in his actual human form for most parts of the movie, we realize that he basically is the weaker person in this world of robotic mannequins, and yes we do see him bleed a lot in this movie (it is funny to note that Willis is one of those actors that just look cooler when he gets more scars and bruises, it's like John McClane only without the crazy action). With him being the frail character, that alone clearly reminds you that this is not your regular Bruce Willis action flick. The movie just basically starts out as a futuristic detective-type movie then progresses into the same mood as Willis was in films like ""Unbreakable"" where he stumbles around a maze that leads him to some enlightening truth. The high points of this movie lie in the storyline. Second is the way the movie creates this amazing-looking world of a future inhabited mostly by surrogates. The surrealism of the movie is not too far-out that most of what you see seem like they exist in the present world; there are no flying cars or rockets everywhere; its just the simple existence and presence of mannequin-like robots everywhere. The storyline may be good enough to be enjoyably satisfying, but it certainly is not the best, or perhaps not good enough to be groundbreaking. All in all, SURROGATES is one of those good sci-fi movies that will simply entertain those who are fans of smart sci-fi movies. Action junkies may be a little disappointed though. This is a far cry from Blade Runner, but this certainly gives you a cheaper version of that kind of enjoyment. I loved it. But it is definitely not unforgettable.",Surrogates
125,dien,boring,3,17 October 2009,"There are so many things wrong with this film I don't even know where to start. First of all, the story is a rip-off of ""I, Robot"" (and I suggest watching that one instead, it's much better). Second, the story is filled with every sci-fi and cop-film cliché you can possibly think of (and the worst thing is that the director doesn't even care). Next, the acting. Bruce Willis is obviously wasted in this one. He is trying, but the plot doesn't give him anything to work with. He is (oh, what a surprise) a drinking cop with marriage problems who lost his son. I'm sorry, but I've seen this 'character' of his so many times that I'm not buying it anymore.The worst thing of all is the PG-13 rating. The limitations it imposes are simply incredible. Without it this could have been much much better.This film has a very interesting premise, but doesn't capitalize on it.

126,scottwallvashon,A Metaphor for the Present,9,27 September 2009,"The important thing to understand about this film is that it is not a prediction of something that is likely to happen. Rather, it is a metaphor for something that has already happened.Television was the earliest foray into this phenomenon. How many of us form a significant portion of our impression of the world based on what we see through this artificial sense organ? With television, we are all 5% closer to the creature depicted in Surrogates. As I sit here at my computer writing from this remote location, I am 10% of the creature depicted in this film. When I get on a discussion forum with an avatar that represents my impression of myself or possibly the impression of myself that I wish to project, I am 20% of the creature depicted in this film.I have begun to teach an online class. My students, instead of seeing me as a living flesh and blood person, now see me as an intellectual engine that they may visualize in any number of ways. I have the option of posting a picture, but have not gotten around to that yet. I now do part of my work from a safe remote location—as an abstract disembodied entity.After leaving the theater, I had an overwhelming urge to spend more time with my dogs.

There was a little too much action for my taste and I didn't get how people who were connected to their surrogates almost 24/7 still had functioning bodies at all, or how they performed basic functions, but the main concept was intriguing.In a world where you look however you want and never get hurt, who would ever use their real body? What is the point? In doing so, are you losing a large portion of what makes you human? The movie asks these questions and others.It started really well for me, as it presented an evolution to the current state of the world. It was progressive, we didn't just get 'bam, this is how things are, doesn't matter how it got here'.The development of the story was OK, it felt the pacing was off a bit at times. I thought the concept and its consequences was so powerful that it could have been better executed – all the action and superhero stuff only got in the way. Still, I appreciated the main characters, their struggles and their development. I particularly enjoyed the anxiety experienced by the main character when going out to the world for the first time in years. All the cool effects were a welcome bonus. That flawless skin Wowza.

Everyone in the world is now able to have a surrogate of themselves if the desire. You can be anyone you want. Look like anything you want. Of course there is a faction of people who resist this and want to rid the world of these surrogates. As part of the plot, this isn't really explored enough, and when you find the reason for that sub-plot, you kind of feel cheated. I felt no sympathy for the characters (except for the already deceased), and the reasoning for the end of the film boils down to selfishness as I'm sure some surrogates were being used to help the physically disabled.

It makes the movie unbelievable.There was a lot more that could have been done with the script but I guess ""It is what it is.""

Who the hell would want to experience life through the eyes of a surrogate? Where's the fun in that? Isn't the whole point of life to get down and dirty? And apart from that, how likely is it that in 8 years time millions of people will be able to purchase top of the line high-tech robots? And even if they could, seriously, why would people willingly decide to become shut-ins?Anyway – apart from all that – the film is based on a comic book series of the same name and was directed by Jonathan Mostow, who brought us the disastrous TERMINATOR 3 (2003). So I wasn't holding out much hope for it, I mean if you can single handedly nearly destroy one of the best film franchises of all time, what chance of creating a brilliant movie from a comic book?The premise is a twist on a familiar tale. In the near future, humans live in almost complete isolation, rarely leaving the safety and comfort of their homes. They experience life vicariously, through remote-controlled robots, called 'surrogates'. The surrogates are designed to ape their human operators and because the human controllers operate behind the front lines, so to speak, people are safe all the time, as unlike, for instance, in THE MATRIX (1999), the damage done to a surrogate is not visited upon its owner.The world, then, is a peaceful place and free from all the dangers and the crimes of today. Until, of course, someone gets murdered. FBI agents Greer, the always watchable Bruce Willis, and Peters, played by Radha Mitchell, investigate the mysterious murder. The victim is a college student who also happens to be connected to the man who created the surrogates.Things take a further twist when humans, who have stayed safe behind closed doors while sending their surrogates out into the real world, began turning up dead and Greer decides the only way to solve the crime is to get out and experience the real world for himself. The film is a mash up of countless different sci-fi classics that have come before, without ever really treading new paths. Using themes that appear throughout Philip K Dick's work, without ever tapping into the uncomfortable dystopia he created and was used to such brilliant effect in films like Ridley Scott's mysterious, noir-influenced and totally mind bending BLADE RUNNER (1982). Whereas that was a hauntingly beautiful meditation on what it means to be human, SURROGATES is merely watchable and only then because of Willis and Mitchell. It singularly fails to leave a lasting impression.With a storyline that's near as robotic as the androids, I left the cinema wishing that surrogates really existed. I would have sent mine to look at this and stayed at home watching re-runs of my favorite DVD's. I suggest you do the same.",Surrogates
134,gtylerpayne,Cool movie with hard to believe plot,7,18 June 2015,"Some of the other reviews here seem to criticize the fact that the characters are not ""human"" enough and hard to relate to. That didn't really bother me. I don't feel like every sci-fi action movie needs to be overly emotional. Sometimes it's okay to have a movie that is just cool and fun, which this movie definitely is.This is an entertaining movie, and if you like sci-fi, you will probably like it. It had a good pace, good special effects, and some cool action sequences. Bruce Willis is well cast, and the acting over-all is fine.The main problem I had with this movie, is that it is really not plausible. The plot is full of holes and the movie is basically impossible to believe. They start the movie by saying that, within 20 years of so, everyone goes from a normal life, to living vicariously though their own personal robots. They even quote the number that 98% of people not live completely thought ""surrogates."" If it were something like 10%, it would be a lot easier to accept. There are places in the world were people still don't have fresh water to drink and have never seen a computer, and they expect us to believe that everyone in developing nations, can afford their own personal sophisticated robot? Yeah, right!Even if the surrogates were useful for certain things, like dangerous jobs, or wanting to go out to a nightclub as a better looking person, there is no way that you wouldn't still want to go out and get some fresh air once in a while. The ending has some interesting twists, but over-all, the ending is very predictable and somewhat cliché.If you like sci-fi, this movie is worth a watch.

136,LemonLadyR,Potentiallly a Good Film But Rating is All Too Telling,6,28 September 2015,"This could have been a really good movie, but it was doomed by fractured characterizations and a terrible script. What the viewer was left with was a below par Bruce Willis action movie plus a great sci-fi premise. The 'world' that was created was very well done, undoubtedly the best part of the film. Anyone familiar with our current virtual worlds and avatars would have felt chills seeing a world that is currently safely inside their computers suddenly brought into real life. Thus this is a very plausible situation. People NOW, in real life, currently sit for hours on end, 'living' in these virtual worlds, 'being' their avatar. Anyone unfamiliar with virtual worlds would be shocked at how close this scenario could be for us in the near future. Besides that, the movie was difficult to get through and I almost gave up many times. And I was never really vested in the characters and bad script. The good news is that real sci-fi is becoming more and more common in movies, which is a great thing for sci-fi fans, for it is a genre which has mostly been ignored or 'pulped', ridiculously, over the entire lifetime of film. Sure, not all films with good sci-fi premises will be good, but at least the genre is opening up. Unless you are a die hard (pun intended) Bruce Willis fan, the only reason to watch this movie is for Ving Rhames (who has way too little screen time) and to check out the world that was created here, which is the only reason I gave it a 6 rating. Without all that, and if this had been a present day cop movie, it would be have been better to turn on the TV and just watch CSI (maybe the best idea, anyway). Oh, and did I mention the ending was completely expected and cliché, and rather truncated? It left me with a rather empty stomach.",Surrogates

138,Joe-146,"Better than I expected, but maybe TOO ambitious?",8,13 February 2011,"I was pleasantly surprised by Surrogates, which seemed to flash in and out of theaters with little notice and tepid reviews. Maybe low expectations conditioned me to ignore any shortcomings in story or execution. The core conceit is familiar, and may have been completely overshadowed by James Cameron's Avatar. In the world of surrogates however, the ""puppets"" operate in the mundane world and are used by nearly anyone who wants one. The only exceptions referenced in the movie are religious/political extremists who vehemently refuse and self- segregate into human-only ""reservations"". The only other exception seems to be children - who aren't even seen in the film, except in an ominous TV ad implying that soon children too will be able to interact with the world in perfect safety through new lil' surrogates... This material is so rich with potential that sticking to the plot without detouring through any of the intriguing ramifications of this avatar-based society, is a real challenge. While the film is good, the material seems so ripe, it would probably have been more satisfying as a mini-series or anthology based in this world. Of course, budgets for a long-form medium might have made it just as unsatisfying for entirely different reasons.I liked the film. It's fine as a sci-fi action thriller in the genres of Minority Report or I Robot. But I found myself more intrigued by the world they created as the set for this movie. Where anyone regardless of age, race, gender, or any other factor of who they were in ""meatspace"" could interact with the world as the physical presence they chose to be. And how what started as a tool of empowerment for those with disabilities became commercialized as candy for the id. And the many unforeseen consequences of that.The premise is so much more than a narrative film could ever be. Given that, Surrogates does a good job at making a traditional action movie out of material that is almost too rich to mine.",Surrogates
139,Rafacus,Surrogates explores the scarier side of avatar life,5,25 September 2009,"Although it felt immensely parallel to Mark Neveldine's Gamer, Surrogates explores the scarier side of avatar life when people opt for living through robots instead of their own bodies. With the charisma and macho swagger that Bruce Willis brings to the screen and the talents of Ving Rhames, James Cromwell and Boris Kodjoe, what really ended up disappointing me was the unimpressive graphics of the Surrogates themselves. Someone should have asked Milla Jovovich who did her makeup in Resident Evil Extinction because she looked more the part of a porcelain robot than the effect they tried on this movie, it was distracting and strange.Plot: When a couple of Surrogate (robots created to replicate human beings) users are killed through their hosts, detectives Greer (Bruce Willis) and Peters (Radha Mitchell) set out to find the source behind the killings. What they find is that a new weapon has been introduced that kills the host and user behind the avatar. A threat that could potentially disrupt the 99% drop in world-wide fatalities that the surrogates originally brought. Greer has grown to dislike the daily routine of living through a Surrogate and before long ditches his avatar in lieu of walking around the city as a human (something that is unheard of). With his own eyes and wits about him, Greer is able to uncover the source of the weapon and the people behind it. With his only grip on human life being his Surrogate addicted wife, he must find a way to stop the weapon which could mean danger for her and everyone in the world that is plugged in.While I can appreciate the sci-fi element to Surrogates, it offers nothing new in terms of plot, storyline and conclusion. It is the fear of a virtual world in the future exaggerated with the visuals of nasty, sweaty, pock ridden humans stuck to their bed-like structures. A world of pasty people plugged into a machine that gives them the control of a beautiful and flawless version of themselves. You have the stereotypical fat nerd in the guise of a hot, blond sexpot, the sex heavy Club scenes and the city filled with people who aren't really people. Think Blade Runner, Matrix and I-Robot and you know the particular shot of what I speak. Yet Greer's city did not feel like a city at all, it felt like a large set with fancy CGI painted all over it to make it look ""futuristic"". I couldn't shake the world in a glass bowl feeling as the streets seem to lead to nowhere and the shots of the external camps looked even worse. The warm and fuzzy feelings of the future that I received when I watched older movies like Minority Report, I-Robot and the 5th Element is missing in this one. There just wasn't enough authenticity in Greer's surroundings and it made it seem so staged.This story seemed to be better suited for a comic book or graphic novel. The big screen does not seem like the right medium for Surrogates because the humanoid CGI look is a long way from being mastered. Still, if you can stomach the visuals to follow Greer in his quest for an answer, you may find a bland and unoriginal police story that ends up being solved a bit too easily. I would suggest that you wait this one out for an evening rental with the family since the violence is minimal (the Surrogates bleed green), there are no real sexual situations and the length is relatively short. I cannot recommend the box office version of this movie.More reviews available at www.SpicyMovieDogs.com",Surrogates
140,MorpheusOne,Mediocre film.,6,19 September 2021,"While I thought the story was good overall, the acting was weak and the choreographed fight scenes looked like something that I might expect to see in a highschool play. Making their amalgamation with the special effects, which were quite good, quite clunky and stiff. It was like a badly directed cartoon with great animation; they didn't do the worst possible job that they could possibly have done, but, still, they dropped the ball! The editing/directing suffered further when you pay attention to what happened in the scene in the alley where Miles Strickland uses the device to fry five cops &, then, later, as described by Greer while in the hospital. There were at least six surrogates in the alley, all cops, and they all got fried. And Greer plus at least one more cop, the pilot, were in the helicopter & the pilot also got fried, too. So, that's at least seven; not five.",Surrogates
141,xenolupa,"These robots do not operate on their own, people!",6,25 March 2010,"I did like this movie. Not spectacularly good, several of the points the critics make are very valid, but I did like it. I did like the acting, Bruce Willis, the chases, the fights. They're not the best I ever saw, far from it, but they're decent.Several of the critics make the same fault over and over again. They compare these robots to robots in AI (which do operate on their own, without somebody directly controlling them), or to the entities in The Matrix (where they are not consciously controlled by their human counterparts, but forced into a certain behavior by circumstances and the AI's).The robots in Surrogates are 100% controlled by their human counterparts. They cannot operate on their own. The movie does contain some mistakes on this aspect, and maybe they are put in there on purpose.I think these robots can best be compared with the avatars in Avatar. I'm sorry there's nothing about training to get accustomed with the robots, as is in Avatar. As with the chimp in the beginning of the movie, a lot of training is necessary to get the robot to do what you want.The critics that I wholeheartedly agree with: - The robot-hating areas don't seem to be filled with the elite. It seems it is an uneasy collection of hippies, rednecks and losers, the same type of people who would refuse to use a computer or internet. It would be very easy for any police- or army-force to take such an area in control. - In our world the majority of the people have a cell phone. I'm not very sure whether the majority of people have a car. Or a computer. Or internet access. Certainly a radio, and a television. Robots like depicted in Surrogates are likely to cost more than an average car, probably a lot more. It would take quite a lot more years than the 15 years to have more than 90% of the world's population to use robots this way. - It would take many many more years for the world's population to use robots this way this extensively than depicted in the movie. To get to a situation where the streets, shops and offices would be solely populated by robots, a situation where the greater majority of people would not ever leave their home, not even for a minute, would take decades of gradual changes. But of course, a movie that tells such a story would be utterly boring. - Even the best massage chairs would not help to stop the deterioration of the human bodies who never get out anymore, who let their robots do all the work. - Humans not interested in real physical sex anymore? Come on, you're kidding. With skull kits as shown in this movie, there is no feedback to the real human body when the robot is touched by another robot. You would need a full body suit for that. So, venereal diseases going down with 90+ %, I doubt it. - If I would have a robot that would be able to jump to or from a rooftop, that would be able to lift a car, or to act tremendously fast, I'm afraid I would turn into a criminal very fast. No jewelry nor bank would be safe for me. I fully understand that there will be robots in those jewelry and banks as well, but still, it is not my body that is getting hurt in the fight, so I might as well go for it. Crime going down... nah, I don't believe it.But still, the idea is nice, many aspects of robotic / human life are shown, so I give it a 6.",Surrogates
142,NousPax-1,Let Your Surrogate Cut the Grass,7,14 October 2009,"Enjoyed this SciFi thriller though wanted it to be longer. Creepy in some ways, but very entertaining. Notable at first is that Willis appears to be 25 years younger. Radha Mitchell is stunningly beautiful in this, but like Willis, THAT is her surrogate. Effects are first class and story line and plot pacing is good. Am biased in favor of ""Robot"" movies and this one delivers decently, though I prefer a darker ambiance like Blade Runner. There is something VERY redeeming about this which involves Willis and his wife, but that should remain a surprise. There is a most excellent action sequence with Radha that You will find highly entertaining. Warning: If any of your loved ones are acting strange check the back of their head for a rectangular opening.",Surrogates
143,jaypugh,Average for a Bruce Willis Film,6,28 September 2009,"The trailer of this film looked sweet and I'm a Bruce Willis fan so it was a no brainer to check it out. The movie is a mixed bag. The acting is good from Willis on down the list. The subject matter is interesting and the relationship Willis' character has with his wife makes you want to know more. It is truly the best part of the film. The real problem for me is that I found Surrogates to have the feel of a thriller rather than an action flick. This is fine but there were no real plot twists and not near enough character development. Basically, you know the entire plot from beginning to end just by watching the trailer. The only question you have to ask is whether Willis is going to manage to let 99% of the population die? It doesn't take a genius to assume correct on this question. Other than this one question I found very little substance. If you have no more substance than this to occupy your brain then you need more action. That's not to say there isn't any action in Surrogates because there is quite a bit. It just needs more if you are going to know the story from beginning to end before the movie starts.Give me one of two things, more action to enjoy the ride or more depth to make me think. Surrogates is just good enough in each of these but not great in either. I believe I would have liked it a lot better if I hadn't seen the trailers but it would still fall a bit flat of my expectations of a Bruce Willis movie. It is by no means bad but it had potential to be far better. 6.5 / 10",Surrogates
144,SJinSeaTac,Exhilarating and fresh idea in the realm of murder-mysteries,9,25 September 2009,"I really enjoy watching fast-paced thrillers and murder-mysteries. Unfortunately most films which are released these days do not put the time nor effort into flushing-out a story. Often times I resort to seedy little horror films to watch a good whodunit film. Therefore Surrogates was definitely a great surprise to me. I went in expecting some idiotic action film which should have gone straight to video and was very surprised at how engaging this film was! The only reason I didn't give this film a 10/10 rating is because Brancato and Ferris most obviously got the idea for their script from the Wachowski Brother's of ""The matrix"" fame. The only difference is that instead of entering another reality people enter the body of a robot for which they use to interact with people in the world right from their homes, never having to leave the house. These Surrogates act and talk just like their counterparts back home, linked-up in their cyber-kinetic chairs, although as you will find in the first act, don't always look like them. The entire benefit of using a surrogate is to never be hurt or killed, and also to look the way you want people to see you.Bruce Willis and Radha Mitchell play two FBI agents investigating the destruction of two surrogates and their operators who were connected to them at the time, which up until then has never been possible. Now, I won't ruin anything, but lets just say that if you can use a surrogate to be ""anyone you want to be"" you might not really always know who you are talking too...or what their ulterior-motives are!!The storytelling, twists & turns, and fast-paced action really move this film along. Also, the special effects are so well put together that when you are watching people on the screen you really believe out of this world things are happening to them...but to me the best part or character of the film is Radha Mitchell. She is required to take on so many different things here and also be believable, and she pulled it off very well indeed! I was actually surprised at how much I enjoyed this movie and at a midnight screening as well. ""Surrogates"" is definitely worth seeing on the big screen, so don't miss it!",Surrogates
145,westside-surfer,Underrated to the max,9,18 October 2013,"This is one of those movies that make me ignore the overall rating system. Currently it stands a 6.0. Surrogates has a tripped out story, great acting on Bruce's part, and enough action to keep it exciting without going full Die Hard.Surrogates takes the idea of social media to a whole new level. I give extra thanks to whoever the writer was. It's on the level of William Gibson (Johnny Mnemonic). Don't be discouraged by the mediocre rating. This is sci-fi gold. I gave it a 9/10. The story could have been pushed a little further in my opinion. Too bad they didn't invest the time it deserved. This could have been legendary status. Super awesome isn't either.",Surrogates
146,warren-1976,Visit the Waxworks,7,28 September 2009,"Surrogates takes the basic premise of what would happen if almost everyone in our world were able to live their lives through an idealised robotic replacement. These replacements feed each person all of the sensations required to feel everything as normal, while their real body lies in a sensory chair at home. In this world, actual murder and most crime have been made pointless, because any crimes carried out, are done so via 'surrogates' on 'surrogates' (So presumably most crime would class as vandalism and criminal damage).Bruce Willis (Die Hard, The Sixth Sense, TV's Moonlighting) and Radha Mitchell (Pitch Black, Silent Hill, TV's Neighbours) play a pair of police officers tasked with investigating the murder of two people whose deaths occurred via the destruction of their surrogate bodies. This leads to a relatively straight forward plot involving a mysterious new weapon and a mad genius intent on mass murder. Meanwhile Willis' character re-discovers what it means to be human when he becomes separated from his surrogate body.Where Surrogates succeeds, is in having a somewhat original story concept (For cinema, at any rate). The initial idea is extremely interesting, and does make us think about how life would be led in such a situation. Where the film fails somewhat, is in its execution. Initially it is off-putting with the actors all looking waxy and perfect, their emotions rather wooden and their physical motion always perfect, and begs the question, how many people would live out their lives this way, when the alternate versions of themselves are lacking in many basic aspects of human appeal? Perhaps this is a moot point, given that many people live such lives already online, addicted to part time lives that are severely limited in comparison to the real world. On the positive side, this does all create an effective contrast later in the film, when our lead begins to return to life in the normal world as his human self.Other films that question our humanity and what it means to be human in different ways, such as District 9 or The Sixth Day, avoid giving us easy answers. They present us with the possibilities in such a way that there is no clear cut right or wrong, yes or no. Surrogates makes its message far too direct. ""It is wrong to live life through a Surrogate!"". There are no ambiguities about the lifestyle presented in the film. No 'what ifs?'.A lot of the general concept points are also skirted around. Why is murder practically non-existent?Although it seems reasonable to say that most crimes of passion and anger would be drastically cut, most reasons for other murders would not change. For example, political murders, revenge, money, etc. Also, what about muscle wastage for Surrogate users? A simple explanation that something in the seats keeps muscles active would have sufficed, but there is none.Bruce Willis looks somewhat unnerving in his surrogate form, essentially a 'Young Bruce' via the miracle of modern CGI effects. Whilst the other actors get similar treatment, though obviously to a lesser degree. Unfortunately the lead characters seem a little underdeveloped. The troubled relationship between Willis' and his wife, played by the reliable Rosamund Pike (Die Another Day, TV's Wives & Daughters), is rather cliché and should have been explored in more depth. Radha Mitchell's character seems almost unused and superfluous, simply a plot- device for the finale. Likewise, the villain and his motivations come as no surprise and merely make us wish for something more original. It could be argued that James Cromwell (Babe, Star Trek: First Contact, I, Robot) is cast in practically the same role as he had in I, Robot, in order to undermine our expectations, but this seems rather too subtle for Surrogates and I suspect it is simply a case of bad typecasting.Unfortunately, Surrogates' greatest weakness is its finale. It certainly pulls the old 'Deus Ex Machina' trick to some extent, with little set-up or reasonable explanation as to why things would work the way they do. Yes, we are given explanations, but they appear rather suddenly and conveniently, everything is concluded far too simplistically. Not to mention a voice over at the end stating that everyone is okay, after a situation that really implies a whole host of potential problems. What about those flying aircraft via surrogates? What about doctors using surrogates who are in the middle of operating on live people? What about babies in hospital wards, or mothers giving birth, where the doctors and nurses would likely be surrogates? I won't give away the plot by explaining why I am asking these questions, but if you see it, you will most likely find yourself asking the same things.On the whole, the effects are excellent, though there are one or two extremely obvious green-screen environments that pull us out of the story. The action is all fun, though nothing especially original. It may sound like I'm being extra hard on Surrogates, as I did enjoy it. I enjoyed the originality, but as you find yourself questioning the story afterwards, it quickly loses its charm. It is better than much of its recent competition, but is perhaps most frustrating due to its under- used potential. Again, as with so many films of recent years, this may be symptomatic of its graphic novel roots. A medium rife with high concepts and visual flair, but often lacking the basic thought, character and emotion of normal literary fare.The director, Johnathon Mostow (Breakdown, Terminator 3), is functional, taking few risks and showing little of the potential he once showed years ago with Breakdown. Surrogates is not a bad film, but it has (ironically, considering its subject matter) been made on automatic, when it had the opportunity to be so much more. It is enjoyable, and certainly worth seeing, but don't expect it to stay with you for very long.",Surrogates
147,movieguysla,Robocops,6,5 October 2009,"""Surrogates"" proposes a fascinating vision of the future, but unfortunately delivers a sub-par movie to explore this future. The idea is that technology has advanced to where people can control movements of robots with their mind. The robots eventually take on the physical characteristics of their ""operators"", to where people rarely leave their homes, allowing the counterparts to experience life on their behalf. This can lead to extreme behavior, as there is no risk involved for the operator, the robot will take the brunt of any abuse or aggression in the physical world.One day a surrogate is murdered (kind of a short-circuiting), causing the simultaneous death of its operator, a situation previously thought impossible. Bruce Willis plays Tom Greer, whose surrogate begins the investigation into the weapon that may have caused this death. Willis is well cast, because he's a rare actor who can look youthful enough to pull off the robotic action hero, and ragged enough in his fifty-some years to be a world-weary policeman.Director Jonathan Mostow has made serviceable action films before – ""U-571"" is especially good and ""Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines"" has its moments for a movie that never should have been made. But you can get the idea that he doesn't have a directorial signature, and that leaves ""Surrogates"" to be a capable feature that never gets too radical or risky. For example, Paul Verhoeven's ""Surrogates"" would have gone to great lengths to examine the excesses in pleasure and danger one could experience through a surrogate. David Fincher's ""Surrogates"" would've been DARK, and the characters would've been a bit more flawed.But where Mostow's ""Surrogates"" lacks in style, it makes up in devotion to story. By no means is this film empty, as the filmmakers have put together a decent who-dunnit with some nifty surprises and a direction that leads the tale back to the running theme of the importance of humanity.The special effects are hit and miss. It seems like movies with the scope of ""Surrogates"" long to have a few F/X shots that can show how big they can be. These shots usually come with the cost of the viewer saying ""Hey, look, it's a big CGI shot"". Instead of saying "" I have nothing to say here because I'm busy being invested in the story"". Sure enough, the surrogate factory is one such ""Hey, it's a green screen"" shot. There is, however, an excellent chase scene as Willis' surrogate chases a man into a 'humans only' sanctuary.Supporting roles are well served as Ving Rhames and Bruce Willis reunite and nobody gets sodomized. Radha Mitchell is very good as her character and her character's surrogates undergo many changes. She's up to the task. James Cromwell is as good as ever as the designer of surrogate technology.I hope I'm not contradictory here, but I could've used a little levity in this movie. Normally, I think action movies foolishly trade in danger for ""let's have fun!"". But often the fun is in the danger. Look at the trailer for the upcoming ""2012"", as actors trade gag lines while MILLIONS of helpless people are perishing all around them. ""Surrogates"" treats its mystery very soberly, and I appreciate that. It's not often that I find myself then wishing for a little more humor, but I could've used it here. You know Bruce Willis would've delivered the comedy goods as smoothly as he does the distress.This film falls in line with similar-themed sci-fi projects of late. It has elements previously seen in ""Gamer"", ""I, Robot"", ""The Sixth Day"", TV's ""Dollhouse"" and classics like ""Blade Runner"", ""The Matrix"" & ""Invasion of the Body Snatchers"". The fact that so many movies are being made about Americans losing their soul may be more of a statement than any of the movies individually make.",Surrogates
148,rrryoyorrr,Surrogate be Kidding,1,15 March 2010,"This movie just does not work on any level, whatsoever. I mean, given the premise is high concept, it still falls flat on execution. Maybe it's the Director, Jonathan Mastow, who really might be a Razzie's winner, for sure. Perhaps it's Bruce Willis who summons his tough guy persona only to have you really not give a sh*t. Needless to say, in order for a movie of this sort to work, one must be eased into a ""suspension of disbelief"", but not for SURROGATES, it tries desperately to pull you into its world, but only with the weakest of traction. A world and time where technology can produce a Surrogate, but yet still have everyone driving around in mid 2000's, model cars. I guess the Art Director didn't do his homework either, because the film is chock full of inconsistencies. Did I mention the story, of which only a writer with no name would have dared write, yet this guy actually put his name on it - don't worry, because I won't mention his name. The story has plot holes big enough for a stadium, zero character development, and an ending that will leave you screaming for your money back.

149,kallepister,Illuminating allegory for online communications,8,1 October 2009,"One of the best CGI ""upholstered"" sci-fi flicks as yet. Very 80s, guess the idea (or even the entire William-Gibson-like script) slouched about for 20 years before it was realizable without appearing ridiculously B-grade. And Bruce Willis looks like Elton John for once, or vice versa :-) So much on the obvious.Ah yeah, IMDb etiquette makes it hard to draw stringent conclusions to real occurrences, but all i can say is that if we web-nuts would turn off our machines for good, get up and simply walk outside our very flats, this world would be very different, and probably a better one, too.Any artificial online identity, let it be 2ndlife or WOW, comprises a substantial momentum of addiction and unresistant devotion. To what? That's where this allegory jumps in quite helpfully. We're no artificial surrogates yet, but already part of and surrounded by a more and more zombified public, where the MP3-downloads on our mobiles may actually mean more to our well-being than the unconcerned, indifferent, fear- and/or greed-powered ambition that accounts for most of our daily uprisings.Crown of creation?

150,SomeUselessGeek,Typical Bruce Willis -- lukewarm,5,29 January 2010,"As with all Bruce Willis flicks this one is neither good nor bad. The writing is mediocre at best. Action, movement, and dialog is all predictable. There are no surprises anywhere in this movie.The chase scenes and explosions are what make up BW flicks, and this one is right in line with what you expect to see. Special effects aren't really all that special, but the movie-going audience is inured to this dependence on CGI to make up for a weak movie. Eye candy here is okay.I won't go into detail about the technical failings of the plot line in this thing because, well, it's a BW movie. Let's just say that one has to turn one's suspension of disbelief up to eleven to watch this film without gagging on one's own spit. If you are watching at home, alone, in front of the DVD player then you can get relief by laughing out loud at some of the stupider technical plot holes.Still and all, this is a good choice for a $1, single night rental out of Red Box. You need to have something else to do while you are watching this movie, of course. If you have something you can do with your hands while the movie plays in the background that works best.

And then came Surrogates. I don't understand how any actor would be willing to sign on to this script when it is such a blatantly awful career move. Stupid middle of the road action movies that do poorly in theaters. That's how to tell an actor is on his way out...just look at John Travolta.The premise is that people are uncomfortable with themselves, so they make these sexy, idealized bodies that they use in everyday life. The people never move their lazy behinds out of their glorified armchairs. I think this is the beginning of the sowing of the seeds that resulted in the immobile sacks of fat called people in Wall-E. I know there was something about a murderer involved, too. They even tried to set up as a mystery, too. The mystery aspect was a colossal failure also. I was able to predict the ending and every plot ""twist"" in the movie. I have since forgotten who the killer even was. The movie leaves so little of an impression that what actually happens isn't important. The only reason this got three stars was that you could say I enjoyed myself. The enjoyment did not come from the movie. It came from the little game called Guess Whats Going to Happen Next. I won.The characters are not endearing in the least. I found myself half-way through that all the protagonists would somehow be killed off. That at least would have generated an interesting plot twist.Oh, wait. I forgot.

It is an interesting fact that there are indeed companies right now which plan to make and sell such robots in the future - and when i read about this a few months ago i immediately thought ""Well...there is certainly a demand for this."" Think about it...why leave the house for buying groceries if you can just send out your robot? <-- and yes i am serious, some companies are developing this tech right now.The movie was a very good example building upon this, how such a technology could evolve...what would happen? Would people simply stay home, unable to move, getting fatter and sicker....and live their lives via ""surrogates"" which do everything for them, going to work...etc..etc.. This is a scenario which (in my opinion)is extremely likely to happen if such tech would be available, sooner or later.Movie was very entertaining and it should make you think and give you the one or the other chill.....although i believe that not many people know that the science fiction in it is actually not that far fetched.I would rate the movie a solid 7.5 and i have seen MUCH worse movies.",Surrogates
153,gas911-1,So mind numbingly awful that its pretty damn good!,5,11 February 2010,"Surrogates works on the same level as a B movie. Its so unbearably awful that actually in the end it's pretty damn good. What had the potential to be more is now lost among the mists of shallow I Robot wannabes, and not just because of its sketchy marketing, simply because there is very little originality here and nothing we've seen done thousands of times before and a million times better. Having said that, Surrogates is essentially a insult to the senses, but actually pays off in the end to become a fast pace and fun action lark. The more far-fetched the plot ties, the more silly and just entertaining it becomes. It's truly a test of ones patience really. The first 20 minutes is so mind numbingly awful that actually those who make it through its slapped arsed entry are somewhat rewarded as the finale comes to play.But as a movie under the lens, this just awful. The dialogue is text book disastrous with such classic classic lines as 'mind if we drop in?' and of coarse 'get lost meat bag'. The acting from co-stars is mediocre, even though Willis' routine of the diluted John McLain is entertaining, he's just not doing anything new in his role. The production also looks tacky but the direction is where the movie really fails! Some of the action scenes are unintentionally comical and so cliché. If you don't go in to this movie with a sense of humour, you may not make it out alive.Overall: Just awful, awful direction, script, production etc..

154,dfeenz,Falls Somewhere Between The Sixth Day (Junk) and iRobot (Tolerable Junk),6,30 September 2009,"Taken for what it is, this is cable TV late night drank two beers smoked two joints kind of sci-fi at its best. It fits snugly among the ranks of The Sixth Day, iRobot, maybe to a lesser extent even The Fifth Element, not in plot but in camp seriousness and general tone and pacing. What it is not, and not to say that it aspires to be, is among the ranks of sci-fi (non- space-opera) classics like Bladerunner or The Terminator (which in hindsight was not actually revolutionary in its genre, and was really a success because it melded time travel, robots and a good old fashioned chase plot and all the pieces fell together just right), or even Minority Report. The setting is a world in which our daily activities preformed in the outside world are done by surrogate cyborg versions of ourselves. This would be interesting maybe fifteen years ago but is now dated and overly familiar in the sci-fi genre thanks to its similarities to The Matrix trilogy. Another problem is that, because Surrogates takes place in the real world, and the people are not slaves or drones of any kind yet they still prefer to live life as a simulated experience, its premise requires an over exorbitant amount of suspension of disbelief. In fact, its implausibility is rather unforgivable, as throughout the film, the many reasons why we could never actually function as a society in such a world are laid on very thick, or at least I felt they were. Beyond the setting, the story is not fresh, even in light of its relevance to our modern way of life - the theme of avoiding reality and relying on technology to shield us from it - can only get it so many brownie points. The plot is streamlined and overly-simplified. I saw the ending coming within the opening two minutes, so as a mystery it fails, in addition to its failure to add anything new to the sci-fi genre. In sum, when it comes to the script, Surrogates is too little, too late. So it fails in its most crucial element, the script. And to be honest, it doesn't really shine elsewhere - acting, directing, action choreography, set design, special effects - they are all serviceable but do not go above and beyond what a modern sci-fi/action/suspense audience expects. So why the 6 out of 10 and not a 1 or a 2, if I have no praises to give? Because in spite of its mediocrity, it did manage to be entertaining for its brief running time. I think it goes without saying this is cinematic junk food, but especially in its genre I can think of a lot worse, so its score is relative.

156,darth-tobe,Not very plausible sci-fi mystery,3,27 March 2015,"Science fiction is often used to illustrate current problems. So, this movie seems to be a modern retelling of the story of the land of Cockaigne. And like the medieval stories it heavy-handedly drives home the lesson about the Land of Plenty being a blessing and a curse.To start with, I liked the visual style, how the Surrogates look all polished and seem to correspond to how people would like to see themselves. I also liked the idea of anonymity, that - like Internet avatars - a Surrogate could be anyone and gives you no clue as to who is operating it. Interesting as these premises may be they quickly fell apart. There are so many things that do not seem to make sense, even within the plot's own world.Without giving away too much here are a few points that may also occur to you during the early parts of the film.If people depend on their Surrogates for everything, even household tasks, and hardly go out anymore why do their muscles not completely atrophy? Haven't they watched Wall-E?How could this advanced robotic technology and neural interfaces (Surrogates are thought controlled) have been developed within 14 years (as stated in the opening) and have become so cheap that the average Joe or Jane can afford them? And if so why is this technology not used for controlling other machines?Logically, for every new development there are those that oppose it. I thought they would be like everyone else just that they reject Surrogate technology. Why would they look like survivors of an apocalypse, live in abandoned building compounds, seemingly also reject all other technology and also be armed to the teeth and ready to go to war?And why does the main character have to be coping with some family tragedy only to illustrate that using Surrogates is bad for you?This was the list after about 20% of the film. Sadly it did not get any better. The science fiction setting has not been thought through. The murder mystery tries half-heartedly to be complex but offers few surprises and fails to deliver as little as a plausible motive. Characters just find clues because they do. In the end there is not even enough sci-fi action to support the film since Bruce Willis is not the youngest anymore and also plays a character who is very vulnerable among all the robots. Wait, does that not sound familiar? Actually, quite a number of elements seem to have been lifted straight from I, Robot. The inventor of the robots is even played by the same actor.

I like that... it sums up the message of the movie that sometimes having the ability to have an easier life is not always as best as being on our own. This story is quite complex in it's building with characters being able to assume different identities as quickly as plugging in a toaster. It kept the story moving along and kept you asking who is on the other side of the surrogate. The plot is pretty good... a man whose invention is perverted and seeking redemption and an FBI agent learning to live in the real world again. Willis puts on a great performance as always and is complimented by the supporting cast. All in all it was an interesting storyline and I highly recommend if you enjoy sci-fi, drama, or action movies you will enjoy this one.",Surrogates

""Surrogates"" is director Jonathan Mostow's interpretation of Robert Venditt's popular graphic novel also named ""Surrogates"" (and no, a graphic novel is not the same thing as a comic book). The live action adaptation of ""Surrogates"" is a visually stunning movie that appears to have gotten butchered along the way to be forced to fit into a 90 minute feature.""Surrogates"" has a great cast supporting Willis in this futuristic sci-fi thriller consisting of Boris Kodjoe, James Cornwell, Ving Rhames, Rosamund Pike, and even Devin Ratray who some may remember as Buzz from the movie ""Home Alone"" (See if you can pick out who he is in the movie. Seems the years have not been so good to him). At first I thought that the acting in this movie was going to be boring. I mean everyone is playing a robot, how much acting can they possibly do? But thankfully we get to see people outside of their surrogates and the movie always plays with the common question of who is really who? Throughout the movie the viewer can never really be sure who is controlling what surrogate and this leaves the movie open for some amazing plot twists.Read full review at FlicksWorthWatching.com",Surrogates

I think if James Cameron had been in on the screenplay and done the directing, it would have been an excellent movie worthy of its premise.As it is, it is not terribly bad; just not overly engaging.I think part of it is Ving Rhames doing that dreadlocked ""Prophet"" thing - it was almost laughable seeing him in that fake hair get-up. I couldn't take him (or his bodyguard goons) seriously; it was almost as if they were doing their characters tongue-in-cheek.Too be sure, all of the surrogates looked really nice, in that artificially perfect sort of way. Kudos to the hair and makeup people on that. Even Bruce Willis' surrogate turned back the clock about 25 years and made him look pretty good. In his normal ragged ""human"" state, he looked like he was channeling an over-the-hill Billy Joel.And what was it with that fake-y ""G.I.

166,proteusphi,Pretty Thoughtless,5,21 October 2009,"Bottom line: Surrogates is a film with an interesting premise but poor execution. In the near future, almost all humans live vicariously through robotic ""surrogates"" that they control with their mind. People never physically leave their homes. Surrogate bodies are designed to be faster, stronger, and more physically attractive that the user's real body.An obviously analogy exists with the internet, where human interaction has increasingly become facilitated by machines. Just like with the internet, surrogate users can be anyone they desire; their robot's appearance is custom designed to their specifications.These ideas alone are enough to get the philosophical wheels turning. Especially when Bruce Willis' character Tom Greer steps out of his home for the first time in years, and begins to grapple with how surrogates alienate humans from one another. Unfortunately, this premise survives so well on its own that it drifts beyond Surrogates' jarring, action-filled plot. This movie is it own ""surrogate"" if you will.Plot elements generally seem poorly thought out and conceived. The audience is asked to believe the entire world is somehow able to: legalize and mass-produce surrogates at an affordable price (remember that 80% of the world's population could considered to live in poverty), while popularizing them and otherwise render their use socially acceptable.....in about 15-20 years.The result of these gaping plot holes is a colossal amount of camp. High quality CGI camp at that. Actually, CGI quality is toned down on the faces of some surrogates to emphasize their inhumanity. Theses special effects seem dated however, so I'm not sure it's an equitable trade.Except for Willis and Rosamund Pike, who plays Greer's wife Maggie, the acting is fairly vapid. Not that this detracts much, as the film is carried primarily by its premise and Sci-fi action. If you can stomach Surrogate's lack of thought and suspend disbelief, then the thrills and action will take you to a....lack-luster and poorly thought out finale. But man, what a ride.

The plot is the same: in the future everybody lives in robotic bodies with human appearance (models are like Spencer Tracy, Mary Pickford, John Wayne...) while their bodies lay in the Vault. But their brains can feel everything that the body does, and can change of body in the same way that in the film. The principal character is worried because a extraordinary damage made to the brain of the robot he uses can produce the death of his brain in the Vault. In mid of the story, the character has to go and fight the traitor of the story without his body, and like Willis in the film, is disturbed by the sensations he feels.

179,mushbuster,"Solid, entertaining cautionary thriller",8,27 September 2009,"SURROGATES.When I see a movie this good that gets reviews this bad (37 percent here at RT), I ask myself, what crawled up their collective posteriors, besides trying to up their reps a notch? (As is so often the case, the NY Post's Kyle Smith is among those who get it right.) Well, in this movie I see several usual suspects.Republican star Bruce Willis, for one. I'm sure they'd all like him to just go away and quit reminding us that sometimes a willful ballsy individual using brute force is, in fact, necessary to deal with recalcitrant baddies (as opposed to boring them to death in meetings). Or, maybe it's the conservative theme that there's more to life than settling into a warm, cozy cradle-to-grave bubble bath of safety, comfort, and recreation--courtesy of either the government or high-tech corporations. It's not the same as aliveness. That's not a message they want us to hear during the current push for the brave new socialistic America. Plus, they probably own a lot of tech stocks But my prime suspect (***SPOILER ALERT***) is the modest, sly observation that many of the radical loudmouths who provide the media's bread-and-butter sound bites--and further the lib causes for which the media shills--would not be there if they weren't backed and/or created by rich sponsors. It must have (censored) THEM OFF that Ving Rhames's wild-eyed Rasta revolutionary was a total phony, as are so many of his real-world counterparts.Or, maybe they just couldn't take the hairpiece Willis's surrogate wears. Whatever. (You're not supposed to like it; they're plastic and they look it.) My opinion: it's a solid, cheesy little thriller with a cautionary point, a solid what's-going-on-here plot, and just enough character development to see it through. And, the ending set piece is a knockout. I chewed my fingernails almost to the quick.Oh, and dear critics, if you think Willis could phone in this kind of performance, as so many of you said in as many words, or any screen performance, for that matter, try acting in a film.

I mean, I'd understand if you could order the robot to do your chores, or even just have a copy-surrogate at work, school etc... so you don't have to travel every day. But no, the best the folk in this film can come up with is sort of escapism from their ugly, unwashed selves.The script-writers should have really read on this little thing called the Internet, that serves pretty much the same purpose today. Or at least browsed through David Brin's ""Kiln People"" novel, that tackles this same subject, only much much better. Oh well, this isn't the first modern movie that tries to pretend these are still the 70-ies, only with cellphones.Aside from the idea, the movie is pretty much standard SF-thriller ride, not too dissimilar from I-Robot, for example. Bruce Willis does a solid job, although his character is too unremarkable for his part to really stick in my mind. There are a few nice action scenes, which serve as little more than trailer-filler, since they do absolutely nothing to move the plot forward.Even if we disregard the shaky premise, the fact remains the movie did little to discuss the central issue of the film (whether surrogates are healthy for humanity) and instead concentrated more on the thrills and the mystery.

184,sweet_angelhugs,Humankind FTW!!!,8,27 September 2009,"Is it me or have recent movies been so bad lately that coming across a movie starring Bruce Willis - with hair! - actually gets a good rating in my eyes? (I don't know where that comment came from since Bruce Willis actually makes good movies. I'm just bitter at Hollywood for not releasing anything good in a while.)Anyway, as mentioned earlier, this movie is actually pretty good. If you liked Equilibrium, you'll probably like this movie, even though it doesn't have the great acting prowess of Christian Bale and isn't laced with beautiful poetry by W.B. Yeats.The reason why this movie is so likable, I believe, is because deep inside, we know this could happen. Unlike Equilibrium, where the entire society injects themselves with something so as to be void of emotions (waitttt... why would you not want to feel anything ever again?), Surrogates involves getting to live your life through surrogate robots that look extremely hot while staying safely at home and not having to worry about dying or getting robbed or getting raped or anything like that. And, well, with technology escalating the way it is, we know this could happen. Did I mention that you can be a fat, balding gay guy and live your life vicariously through a hot blonde lady surrogate, so you can get with hot male surrogates? Chyeah.Now, in theory, this sounds great. But what happens when suddenly everybody can afford these surrogates and therefore has one and everybody starts relying on them so much, they forget to actually *live*? Again, we know this could happen. As people get addicted to drugs, it is also possible to get addicted to surrogacy. And well, that's no good.Now, see, I think it would be great if *some* people had surrogates. Like, if they get disfigured because of an accident or can't walk or to fight wars or to have gigolos like in A.I. or just for fun, every once in a while like in a virtual reality game. But all day every day? Anyway, this movie delves into all that and I thought it was pretty cool. You should look into it and then definitely read below my spoilers line, so we can argue. Arguing rocks my world.***** SPOILERS : DO NOT READ BELOW THIS LINE IF YOU HAVEN'T SEEN THE MOVIE (unless you don't mind spoiling it, then that's fine) *****At the end of the movie, Canter wants to kill all of the humans still plugged into their surrogates because, as he puts it, ""addicts must die with the addiction"" and ""the world should witness the rebirth of humanity"". This makes perfect sense to me. Why did Bruce Willis stop him? Those people deserved to die! Am I wrong? By just killing the surrogates, Bruce Willis didn't really achieve anything. You know what's going to happen? Humans will simply figure out how to make new surrogates - and better ones, at that. Congratulations. You made things worse. If he had only let Canter do his job, people would have been killed and the people who remained living wouldn't dare make new surrogates because they'd be scared of the possible repercussions, i.e. death.

The starting premise itself was a stretch - 98% of the people in the future use surrogates. There is absolutely nothing in this world that 98% of the people agree on, not to mention a surrogate would be an expensive piece of machinery which not everyone could afford. The plot involves Bruce Willis playing a his tired ""rebel-cop"" persona (only looking strangely like Robbie Rotten from Lazy Town when he is in ""surrogate self"") and stumbling upon various conspiracies involving VSI (corporation producing surrogates), the military (of course), and the inventor of surrogates (who apparently in all his genius cannot figure an obvious explanation for his son's death and needs Bruce Willis to point it out to him). The subplot of the movie involves reservations where surrogates are not allowed and shot on sight, even if they are law enforcement surrogates. How the government decided to waive their sovereignty to a bunch of regressionist secessionists is not explained. The regressionist reservations are filled with clichéd fat hillbillies and are led by Ving Rhames with dreadlocks, who delivers his lines with a passion of a low level politician reading off a teleprompter. There are other problems that I can go into such as surrogates being strong enough to withstand collision with a car yet falling apart under the force of Bruce Willis' bare fists, as well as the non-nonsensical robot beauty salons, but if I describe every hole in the plot, I will probably have to post the entire film's screenplay.

188,darrbarker,"Imaginative, thought provoking, should have been a bigger hit",7,25 October 2009,"An intelligent, though provoking slice of sci fi that, if I Robot didn't exist, would be quite original. Nothing in Surrogates matches up to I Robot – neither the FX, script, cast or locations, though it remains an interesting and watchable film. I was amazed to see James Cromwell turn up in this film, he played a very similar character in I Robot. Guess it was a good paycheck. Bruce Willis is excellent as always, I think the film's marketing poorly presents him with excessive make up and that ridiculous wig, which almost put me off seeing this film. I'm glad I did, and when I realised that its a robot surrogate of Willis, I wondered why the marketing didn't make it clearer. Anyway, I digress. Willis has a crime to investigate, and the path leads him into the darker side of the whole surrogates industry, which hinges upon the spotless reputation for reliability – no harm can come to a human who employs a surrogate in their day to day life. Bruce discovers murders which suggest otherwise, and naturally there is a big conspiracy to ensure this information doesn't see the light of day. Willis is an everyman kind of guy, who longs for real people, not least his wife. I found the back story to his marriage, and only child, to be a masterstroke by the script writer(s). It really does anchor the story well, and makes you root for the guy. Surrogates didn't do very well at the box office, and apart from Die Hard 4 Willis hasn't had a big commercial hit for a long time, but there is nothing wrong with this film and maybe ten years ago, it would have been massive. That's not to say the film is dated. It should find a wider audience on DVD, and deservedly so.",Surrogates
189,ngiuphobia,How do you save humanity when the only thing that's real is you?,7,9 April 2010,"Remember i-Robots or The Terminator franchise? movies where robots rule our world? Well, this movie is nothing like those. Okay, a bit. but not robots-going-bad stuff you like. Surrogates is what I thought would really happen next decade. It's about creating something you thought would be useful but in the end keeps you away from real life society. Surrogates are robotic-clones made to represent ourselves in society. It's like a persocon which looks exactly like us. Owning a surrogate means you can have whatever body you ever wanted, being places without ever leaving the house, doing whatever you want without the consequences of getting hurt physically. Imagine playing The Sims in real life. That is Surrogates.Story begin when a policeman named Tom Greer (Bruce Willis) is forced to leave his house for the first time in his real body to investigate a murder of other's surrogate. What strange about the case is the fact that its user was found dead exactly as his surrogate got killed. That is not supposed to happen when you use a surrogate, for it is originally created to make you safe. Juggling between solving the case, finding the truth and coping with his own emotion and passion of being a real human in an unrealistic world. The needs to feel and being attached to each other, even knowing that his wife is trying to hide herself from the pain of losing their child, making Surrogates more emotional and touchy than typical sci-fi. Watching the movie also make you aware of what technology can possibly turn us into.Ain't focused on who the bad guy is, Surrogates really wanna tickle your humanity. Wheter to life flawlessly in a surrogates world or dealing with your problems and be fully human. Just like its tagline: How do you save humanity when the only thing that's real is you?",Surrogates
190,YouFightLikeACow,Bold Finish,9,25 September 2009,"When I first began watching the documentary-style introduction to Surrogates, I had to admit I was impressed because I'm a sucker for these openings (I loved District 9), but I was afraid I was in for another cool futuristic type movie like Minority Report or I, Robot. Admittedly, these were two great movies yet I feared this movie would bring nothing new to the table. We've already seen huge interactive ads, protests against machines, moral dilemmas, and conflicted leaders trying to make statements (James Cromwell plays almost the same character in both I, Robot and Surrogates!). What new things could the director of Terminator 3 show us? It turns out he could bring us what I, Robot failed to deliver as effectively: a good knockout resolution. In other words, this movie delivered a non-Hollywood type ending, similar in the vein of Watchmen (though that is thanks to the great Alan Moore). I always appreciate when a director is willing to go out and boldly create a vision (even if it is based on a graphic novel, some directors like Carter Smith still change the ending – as he did for The Ruins movie).The film is the tale of a world where everyone's basically a couch potato. Technology is so amazing that we can create multiple robots of ourselves, in any form, and control them from the safety of our own homes! We're completely safe as long as we're plugged into the network and no one harms us as we operate the surrogate robot, or ""surrey."" But as usual, conflict arises and the characters are drawn into a world of corruption, rebellion, and sacrifices. The screenplay is full of twists and turns, all very smart and satisfying, though somewhat predictable. Doesn't really matter to me though; films like these are made for mindless action with parts that make you think. Or so I thought.Mostow, a natural action director, handles the camera very well in action sequences. It's the usual Hollywood fare with great, fast-moving action and impressive special effects (though I keep thinking of Transformers 2 when I say that, so I probably won't mention CGI again). I also really liked how much he utilizes the element of surprise: there were many moments where I jumped back in shock, though there wasn't anything necessarily that scary. It's just the juxtaposition-ing of calm and BANG. It's clear Mostow is good with the action cam (nothing new in the era of Michael Bay), as he demonstrated in T3, but this time around I was impressed by how he directed the emotional scenes with Bruce Willis and his wife. He handled the feelings well. This in part has to do with Bruce Willis as an actor as well. He did a fine job with this movie, solid. There's also some good humor too, though I think I laughed too much. And it all led to the final punch.These are all similar-sounding critiques for me. I tend to enjoy cinema for what it is: for pleasure. However, what was different was the ending. I was expecting the typical run-of-the-mill Hollywood ending, but it certainly wasn't (though there was a bit of a twist). I must admit I gasped a bit when I saw the end. I said, ""Whoa."" If a film, amidst good stuff, brings home something new (District 9, for example, was a seriously good commentary besides an action film), I'm impressed. I appreciate it very much: Mostow keeps the audience in mind. Sure, there were flaws (like its short running time, sometimes it takes itself too lightly) but overall it was a great viewing experience. I was enjoying it as I watched – as I usually do for movies – but the bold Watchmen-like finish really brought it home for me.Oh, and Ving Rhames was pretty damn bad-ass.",Surrogates
191,No_Nonsense,"Nice movie, but nothing brand new under the sun...",5,21 December 2009,"I'm a sucker both for science-fiction and for Bruce Willis. So I was quite looking forward to watching this movie. Yet it didn't exactly fulfill my expectations.So we follow Mr Willis in a world in which people use surrogates, which are robots that can act and connect in real life, comfortably guided by their owners from the bed or the couch. Bruce Willis plays a policeman who has to investigate the murder of a wealthy boy. And who has to deal with the few remaining ""anti-surrogates"" people. So far, so good. A simple plot, nothing too new or too complicated about it. But that's kind of the problem. See, in the massive science-fiction universe (I'm mostly talking about books, but you'll find it in many movies and TV shows as well), the concept is pretty much old news. To make it really interesting, you need to add a lot of twists and have some solid characters to have the viewer captivated. And the film lacks of both. The story is simple, but far too predictable. The characters are not really interesting ; some of them being plainly unlikable.However, this is not a bad movie, and you may even find some moments enjoyable. But it's definitely not a worth-see. Just catch it on TV in a few months, but don't go out renting it. It's nice, but it's not worth your money either.",Surrogates
192,stoneage22,Better than expected,8,13 October 2009,"Someone please tell me why the critics panned this movie! Is it the best sci-fi movie ever? No. Is it Bruce Willis' or Rhada Mitchell's best acting job ever? No. However, it definitely deserved more than the 1 star some newspapers gave it. I really feel that they were slightly offended. In this day and age, the message of the movie applies to a great many people.In the movie, almost the entire population spends their entire day, flat on their backs, hooked into their machines controlling robot versions of themselves. The surrogates in the movie serve as a metaphor for several types of hi-tech vices. Far too many people in the real world, spend too many hours a day 'hooked into their machines'. A study has found that many children sleep with their cell phones, so they don't have to fumble around in the dark when they get calls or texts in the middle of the night. The average American spends 3 hours a day on the internet, not counting work. Judging by the number of overweight people we have, the number of hours has probably gone up since the last count was taken. How long before our people all work from home and no one gets up from in front of their computer? I also thought the movie captured very well, the attitudes such people will have. When the real Bruce Willis suggests to his wife that they take a vacation as their real selves, his wife is almost offended. She says; ""Without our surrogates? Are you kidding!?"" The same way someone today would say; ""Go without my cell phone?? Are you nuts?"" The movie is not subtle in it's message at all. Nothing subliminal here. In fact, the movie is positively preachy at times. The people who are the most critical of 'Surrogates' are probably the ones at whom the movie is most aimed. Given how many people spend huge chunks of their lives staring into their screens, I think the message cannot be too strongly emphasized. Almost everybody can learn something from this movie. All parents should make their teens see this movie. This is a warning, as many science fiction films are.As to the action. Very good. Not as hard hitting as the first 'Lethal Weapon', but still very good. When Rhada Mitchell reports; Bruce has been in a car accident, seconds before his vehicle is actually smashed, it is both ""WHOA!"", and eerie. When the bad guys get control of our whole grid, beware! Over all, I liked it. So did a friend of mine who expected it to be awful because of the bad reviews in the papers. Definitely worth seeing.",Surrogates

They are supposed to have penetrated 1/7 of the population in just several years, and even with the outside society being robots, the world still looks the same as today - hard to believe they would still provide the comforts of life for robots. That said, if you suspend belief, it's a pretty good film - well made, decent story, and thoughtful action/reaction. Good effects too - the surrogates are well represented here with unnatural skin textures and false expressions. The lack of too much backstory was a good approach, otherwise it would really mess with your mind. Obvious similarities to Minority Report and I,Robot.",Surrogates

The story line COULD have been good, but instead, wasn't. it felt rushed, it only brushed onto some topics that would have made it better, instead, the film writers obviously tried to put in some lame storyline to keep it together, but failed miserably.

196,jquirke-587-970468,Positively Cartesian,7,25 January 2016,"I rated this film a little better than it's current IMDb rating (6.3). The premise of a futuristic world where people now live their lives in an almost wholly virtual manner is positively Cartesian and for this alone it deserves some credit in my opinion. The film tries to flesh out (pun intended), through Bruce Willis's character, some sort of lesson with regards to what it means to be real, to be human and to truly live and feel. In a strange new world where almost everyone is now living their actual lives in a reclusive state, hidden in their own homes but continuing to venture out into the real world in virtual form through the use of a robot or Surrogate, one cop(Bruce Willis) is forced to go rouge/off grid in order to track down a murder who has somehow gotten hold of a device that can destroy/kill both robots and the person controlling them at the time. The case leads him to come into contact both directly and indirectly through various surrogate forms with the father of one of the victims, who as it tuns out is a reclusive billionaire and the father/inventor of Surrogate technology. As the story unfolds, we learn that the cop has also lost a son in the past and that this is one possible reason he and his wife choose to live their lives in robot form. We see too that once he goes off- line there is a personal desire on his part to reconnect with his estranged wife (who happens to live/ exist in the very same apartment as him) in her human form rather than her robot form but she like most people is resistant to the idea and fearful of how real her feelings of loss and fear will become if she unplugs. Through a couple of expected twists the film ends with a him saving the day but then being given a choice between making the world/ peoples experiences of it 'real' again (despite the pain, suffering and inconvenience it may cause some people) and allowing it to continue in the vain, superficial /artificial and emotionally and physically removed form it has taken. The lesson I think it that it is this pain as well as the joy we experience that makes life unique, life was never meant to be this easy. Ultimately it is only in the doing, the being and the experiencing of all of it ,both good and bad, that life becomes 'real' and so worth living.",Surrogates

I can't see it being possible that it would become the norm so quickly, which immediately had me question the premise. This wouldn't be too big a deal if the storyline was written better and didn't have so many holes. It's never good watching a movie and finding yourself constantly challenging it - Why would people bother having their surrogates drive, how likely is the severe segregation of people in just a short time, why was crime so abruptly eradicated (the surrogates cost money don't they), etc.All that would be excusable if it was still entertaining in a mindless action movie sort of way.

And it often gave me a creepy feeling, because I could really believe people acting like that, given the technology.With Surrogates, it is mostly just action, and plot involving some maniac trying to destroy the world.As far as Sci-Fi part of it is concerned, and how it is supposed to imagine the way human behavior would change, given the technology, the biggest revelation it had, is how surrogates allow you to disconnect when you don't like the conversation. Well, how is that different from hanging up the phone?If you can control a mechanical replica of you, would you just go about your day acting like a normal person? And that is my main disappointment with this movie. The fact that the world is populated with surrogates had little visible effect, except the people are prettier. But then most movies are populated with above average looking people.Surrogates could be a movie about normal people without any sci-fi elements, and the plot could've remained almost the same with only a few adjustments.Gamer may be a less polished movie, but it honestly tried to imagine a different world, and if you love science fiction, that is the movie to see.",Surrogates
199,sipovic,it is good to be Bruce even if you old,3,28 September 2009,"Watched ""Surrogates"" yesterday. It is kinda funny to go to the movie when you know it would be a failure (which was obvious after a minute of trailer), but in person ""Surrogates"" somehow managed to be even more pathetic. The only reason why producers gave money on this project is because Jonathan Mostow (our favorite T3 director! ) somehow convinced bruce willis to be a part of it. Everything in Surrogates is bad. Barely alive script, very rare and badly directed action segments, lazy dialogues with actors on the edge of going to sleep. This movie is long boring travel from one antiutopian clishe to other, each plot twist is predictable as it only could be. Each element of this movie was 100 times before in other movies and in most of them it was much better. In a week you can't remember anything about it (so this why I'm writing about it right now). In my opinion the first and the most important goal of each antiutopia (even bad ones) - to make viewers to see why their world is not right. Superdirector Mostow somehow managed to fail where even pathetic and blurry ""Gamer"" get a pass. He couldn't convince me why I must prefer to be old, ugly loser instead of being superstrong, superfast always young and good looking Terminator-look alike robot. He constantly repeats ""we lost our humanity, we lost our humanity"" but we never could understand what is exactly this Mostow's humanity. And the only message i've got from this movie - ""don't be afraid to be a human, if you're Bruce Willis of course"". I sincerely hope that it would be another 6 years at least till Mostow will decide to direct something. Or actually it would be better it he'll never direct a movie again.

Although dripping in formula, Surrogates follows through on its own logic, and is just plain fun to watch. Its save the world theme parallels rather nicely (as opposed to competing with) the main character Sergeant Tom Greer's ""touching"" personal account. Bruce Willis was brilliant as the disenfranchised officer, who loses his badge after pursuing a cop killer into the no-surrogate zone. Surrogates' decent pace and clever moments really made it for me, and the difference between the surrogate and human characters was a nice touch.

This is definitely not the worst,but one the of the really bad movies.The truth is that i really liked the idea behind the story. We must not forget that no machine can replace the emotions,desires,feelings we experience. We must not forget that no machine can make the mistakes we make so it can learn. Like i said the idea behind the story of living our lives through the eyes of Surrogates really grabbed me,but that was it.First i want to say that it defended passionately TS,because the truth is that i really loved it. It should not be compared with T1 & T2 because it's a whole different movie in which we have a war for the survival of one species,not a fight between two machines. Don't get me wrong i loved T1 and cried like a baby on T2.The fact that i mentioned i defended passionately TS is because it was written from the guys who wrote Surrogates. The problem of Brancato and Ferris is that they actually never slow down in their movies. Everything they wrote has this pace which is trying to keep us distracted from what is the movie really about,but that's not for long. Maybe they don't know what is the movie about. Or maybe they do this because they lack of writing a good dialogue(the dialogue in Surrogates was one of the worst i have ever seen in my life).Anyway to summaries i think this was a bad movie with awful dialogue,bad performances(i don't know if they tried to play robots or what) and a great idea. The sad thing is that we see this combination great idea-poor execution more often than we should.P.S. How can this movie has the same rating like The Matrix Revolutions?!",Surrogates
205,carlsalf,The Robots are Coming,7,17 October 2012,"According to this movie in the not so distant future, people will be all day in bed while a robot (a surrogate) through a neural connection impersonates them, doing all the work, sweat and enjoyment of life. This works if you want to be someone else, whether another gender or to have better looks or when you're ill and cannot move or basically if you want to be immortal and a super-hero. In other words it is the perfect world When two Surrogates (in a passionate kiss in the back of an alley) are killed, prompting their ""operators"" to die from a gruesome manner, two detectives are brought to the case in order to investigate, catch the killer and of course find his end game. It is very important for them to discover what has happened, because people have burnt, crashed and pushed their robotic-selves to death countless of times and there are safety measures for them not to be killed, so this case can shake the foundation of the society.It's an interesting premise, but the execution is flawed and at times boring, there are red-herrings all over and the ultimate result is not really satisfying because you can see it coming miles away. More important, when the robot make-up of Bruce Willis is scary and at the same time campy, you know we're not in a very good movie.The plot involves murders, conspiracies, the inventor of the Surrogates and a colony that is against robots and considers them an abomination with a self-proclaimed prophet (Ving Rhames in another very scary and campy make-up, seeing a trend here??) leading the colony into illumination and salvation. In the movies, when there is a colony like this, they always have something to do with the murders or be involved somehow.The visual effects are useful, even if at times the robots look like they're made of plastic, but there are two well done and intriguing chase sequences that sell the great advantages of being a robot (like being shot and not dying or jumping great distances).I wasn't looking for an award winning picture, I was just looking to be entertained or thrilled and although the movie is not completely bad or a waste of time, it mostly lands flat.",Surrogates

The idea of having a surrogate was what kept me watching, as in, ""Ok, let's see how things go."" The acting, at least from Bruce Willis was rather good, could have been better, and I'm not talking in the action scenes, I'm talking about the conversation he has with his wife, and his actions, not the action itself.I gave the movie a 6/10 for the story idea and the acting, but I can't say I liked it as to recommend it further to friends or other people, as seen from my point of view of course.

207,grzinnj,Review from a Bruce Willis and Die Hard movie series fan,5,29 September 2009,"Being a fan of Bruce Willis and the Die Hard series, this review is from that perspective.I've been waiting for another Bruce Willis movie with the action, sly humor and tag lines of the Die Hard movies.Being a fan of Sci-fi movies, I wanted so much for this movie to be like that. For sci-fi entertainment, this movie is good, but it there is absolutely no humor.The premise behind the movie is thought provoking: For years people had been living their dream lives through the use of surrogate robots. Then came the first murder in many years: A human host murdered via an electronic attack on the surrogate. An investigation into the murder by the Bruce Willis character insues.However, this movie was more strait investigation and less action and completely void of the sly humor or tag lines.An example from Die Hard 1 of the sly humor I like: After killing the first terrorist, McClane dresses the dead guy up like Santa Claus and sends him down an elevator with a message for the other terrorists: ""Now I have a machine gun. Ho, Ho, Ho."" and then there was the tag line ""Yippi Ki Yay M*****F*****."" I cannot remember one such tag line from this movie. In Surrogates, the Bruce Willis character didn't even get injured.In short, if you're looking for the kind of Bruce Willis character as in the Die Hard series, don't look here. Just enjoy it for the sci-fi thriller that it is.For entertainment value, it's worth seeing. I was just looking for something not provided here.",Surrogates

No surprises for anyone there. The most ludicrous casting was casting Irving Rhames as The Prophet. Rhames has one skill: to try to impress people how important he is. Any fame he earned from Pulp Fiction was due to the actions of other actors and nothing he did. This film does nothing to improve his standing. The only humour in the film comes from laughing at Rhames.With the exception of Radha Mitchell and Rosamund Pike, it is hard to tell the difference between the robots and the real people in this dud.Rosamund Pike puts in a reasonable performance as the wife of Bruce Willis and it is not hard to see why her character is a pill-popping wife, who would rather live her life through her surrogate.

Basically in the future humanity stays at home and controls their robot alter-egos in the outside world, thus cutting down on crime completely. Who wouldn't want a world without crime and lawlessness? Apparently somebody does, which is completely dumb and stupid and goes completely against what the movie is all about. It's dark and gritty but it's self-defeating and a cheap, lazy and bad rip-off of Blade Runner.

After you see the first 5 minutes, you already know whats the point, what's going to happen and how it's gonna end.

So it was more than obvious that sooner or later he would have rebelled against the earlier mentioned new technology that was supposed to make the life easier, and that he'll finally find a way to break it by the end of the movie. What we needed to see this time was an innovation not only in technology, but in behavior. Personally, I really didn't expect to see that machine-hating-protagonist stereotype to be repeated any time soon in a movie after all the Terminator sequels we saw (if nothing else)...",Surrogates

It all starts with the corporatists, seen as Republicans all day all night.2. Then you have the Prophet, who's obvious socialist tendencies would quickly have you assume is the leftist side of the political spectrum. Why would I think this? The leader was cruel, heartless and his pictures were everywhere. Propaganda was also prominent in the ""Rez"".3. Now, you eventually realize that the Prophet is, in fact, one of the corporatists.4. Every good libertarian knows that Republicrats are one in the same. They all want power and they all have their ideas on how to get it.5.

214,josephdeungria,Surrogates? Facebook and SMS,10,8 November 2009,"I like watching movies. The larger-than-life screen and detached but captive setting enhance the movies' ability to magnify/ abstract/ simplify and distill streaming snapshots of life in past, present and future versions. I especially enjoy the Sherlock Holmes exercise which I can't help but do at the end of the movie during which I second guess what message or ""moral"" lesson was being conveyed by the ever artistic directors and imaginative writers. In the past, I have let these flood of thoughts keep me entertained for hours after the movie ends, only to be forever lost in sleep and the wake-up-joe realities of everyday life.But now there's technology. Blogs. And doggone, its free and simple. So, as a first attempt to try to salvage my sanity and stoke the flickering fire of hopeless writing passion that remains within me, here I go with trying to guess what Surrogates, the movie starring Bruce Willis, was all about. And, no, I haven't gone to the movie website or read any reviews about it. Not yet.The movie was set in the distant future, a time when technology allowed human beings to use life-like robots, or surrogates to do everything better: go to work, eat, make love and lust, hang out without the risk of death, injury or rejection. The only thing the human has to do is to sit back in the comforts of his room, attach a device that allows him or her to see, feel, taste and experience everything the surrogate does, that is until the surrogate robot comes home and needs to be charged. The surrogates, which need to have the neurosignature of the human controlling it , can be made to look younger and prettier, jump higher and be stronger than the real thing. The surrogates became so good in fact, that everyone, including Willis aging wife, no longer felt comfortable going out into the real world to compete against the other dashing and perfect surrogates.Surely, this is all fiction and will never happen in our lifetimes. You're right of course until you realize the extent to which technology already allows us to project only our best foot forward. Most facebook pages contain the best photos that we have, never mind if they were taken 10 years and 20 pounds ago. I doubt whether there is anyone who actually shows all the photos taken from their digital cameras. No, no, no. My best guess from my own guilty experience is that photos are carefully selected and uploaded based on which ones show the good and fun side of us during certain events. In some way, facebook has become our surrogate face. Not in the future. But today.And SMS or texts? Probably our surrogate language. Why risk saying something wrong when speaking live with another human being. Isn't it supremely better to carefully select our words, erase or modify at will prior to sending it? And of course, put a smiley face or attach a photo to make it personal. No fear. No rejection.This blog post? My surrogate unpublished book. Email? My surrogate letter. Cable TV and Playstation 3? My children's surrogate babysitters. The internet? My surrogate world. If you are still reading this, then I rest my case. Do you dare think of the day when all these perfect things are taken away? The movie, Surrogate, proposes that when that moment comes, then we start to live. ... Remigio De Ungria",Surrogates
215,daneris,There is potential here...,4,6 March 2010,"An interesting view of a future that has been completely seduced by supposed safety and appearance at the sacrifice of reality and substance.Yes this is a film that has great potential. The somewhat utopian / dystopian reality raises some interesting questions and allows for original interactions. I do however think that not enough prominence was given to a lot of the pivotal events of the movie and Willis as well as the other characters seemed to just go along with most everything that happens. Perhaps the problem here is that the Surrogates are being portrayed as robots. In actual fact would they not be acting just like the humans that are controlling them. Perhaps even more energetically as people would all be over confident in their Avatars.As well as falling short on emotional interactions (more attention could definitely be paid to the people who do not agree with use of the Surrogates or ""Dreads"") Willis is the only character in who we see any semblance of character development.The concept to Surrogates is extremely eerie, but I didn't feel this was tone was endorsed by Mostow anywhere near as heavily as it should have been. It seems there is something ugly just below the surface that is never fully exposed or utilised for it's potential effect.In my opinion a slightly darker overtone was needed to the film to suit the reality of the status quo. Instead, everything feels too glossy and bright with it's everyday sunshine and pristine environments.Entertains, but leaves you wanting something a little more in depth.",Surrogates
216,tim-chappell,"nice concept, badly wasted by rip off formulaic storyline.",2,17 February 2013,"Let's start by being fair, this isn't a terrible film, but it only just managed to pass as watchable for me. The idea of living by proxy via a surrogate is novel and is a great foundation for a scifi film, but very quickly it appears that the author has seen iRobot and Minority Report and has ""been inspired"" by them since the characters have striking similarities, as does the plot, and indeed the visual imagery on many many occasions. I therefore personally felt like I was watching a cheap knock-off (the parallels with iRobot was embarrassingly close in my opinion). This would have been OK because the aforementioned films were good solid scifi, but so much of this version felt cheaper and less polished. Bottom line then: if you've not seen the aforementioned films and are a Bruce Willis fan then there is merit in this film, but maybe don't pay too much for it. If you have seen iRobot and are a bit picky about what you watch then only stoop this low if you're browsing the bargain bin and really have nothing better to do with an evening, but don't be surprised if you feel a bit diddled by the many many similarities. I finished the film feeling like the studio had taken the p1ss out of the paying public by making such a blatant rehash of other people's ideas.",Surrogates
217,libfredumb,Concept was almost too big for 90 minutes,8,20 July 2010,"I didn't even know this was made until I was poking around a DVD bin. I thoroughly enjoyed it. It had some pretty good action scenes, a hell of a concept, and a really good plot. That being said, the plot could have shown more development, but this did not ruin the eventual resolution in the film. The film would have benefited by getting further into the situations going on. The twists did not get enough lead-in and characters were not given enough screen time to show their actual importance. Some of the lines weren't delivered in a smooth form by a few of the actors. This happens a lot with sci-fi and fantasy movies because the rhetoric is so foreign that actors don't know how to use it. The concept of the movie really sets up the plot. So, much can be done with it, and yet, very little was. Another hour and this could have been Bruce Willis' best movie. Perhaps, it wasn't longer because they didn't want the sub-plot of the huge concept of 'surrogates' to take over the main plot of crime mystery. It was worth the time and money to watch",Surrogates
218,clinbogan,eerily hits way too close to home,8,30 September 2020,"Saw this movie when it first came out back in 2009 and thought it was pretty good, despite not being particularly partial to sci-fi. Fast forward 11 years later to 2020, and I find myself constantly thinking about this movie and how it is bizarrely the reality we now live in.Plot Summary (no spoilers) - In a not-so-distant future, society succumbs to vanity and narcissism resulting in our dependence on technology to live out our daily lives through flawlessly beautiful 'surrogate' bodies.Even if you don't like sci-fi, give this one a try. In the age of selfies, photo filters, social media, and cyber-communication, this movie makes you stop and think - why are we so obsessed with this formulated idea of beauty and perfection, and what is the toll 'being perfect' takes on us all as a society and as individuals?",Surrogates

They (probably) spent a good amount of money on this movie, which has a script that could be only good for an episode of a TV series, and nothing more.You've got a few good options to make the story more exciting with the protesters, hi-tech stuff, etc. but no, you only see two agents and their boss, and surprisingly they cannot see who's behind all the killings...And then, the ending, how stupid is it? They stop the brain-melting of the people, but not the surrogates, how convenient !!! And they expect people to just walk out and give up using surrogates, how convenient !!! They'll just order a new one and get VSI richer and richer. Good job Bruze Willis !",Surrogates
220,philoking1,Thin. Very thin.,4,3 February 2010,"OK, for the plot, read the overview. I'll just dive right into the problems. And I'm not even going to bother pointing out all of them -- Surrogates isn't worth the effort.*spoilers be here*The crime behind this detective story is too illogical to be believable: A huge company (VSI) with a product so desirable that 98% of the world's population uses them (surrogates) decides to kill the ousted inventor of the product just because he has a problem with them? That'd be like McDonalds murdering a vegan. It just makes no sense.Even worse, we're supposed to believe that VSI dangled the bribe of a private-sector job to some mid-level FBI supervisor to get him to act as a go-between? Riiiight. Planning murder? Call a random cop! He'll be sure to help. I mean, all he has to do to cover up his involvement is to deflect attention away from the first murder to occur in years -- a murder which, by the way, just happens to highlight a (literally) fatal flaw in the most-used piece of technology in the world. How hard could that be? -This was just a transparent plot device to set up a close-in turncoat for Bruce Willis to confront.Even WORSE, we're supposed to believe that VSI would break out the one weapon in existence that can undermine their product's 100% safety record? And that they'd give it to a radically anti-surrogate Dread? Oh sure, what could possibly go wrong there?For the attempt at emotional filler, the background of Bruce's child's death was handled horribly. They don't finish setting up the reason behind his wife's deep escapism until the end of the movie. By then it's too late -- you've already judged her using the base assumption that her reliance on her surrogate is just the same addiction as everyone else, so she just comes across as childishly petulant. Bruce Willis's character performance was great here. But with the surroundings bungled, my feelings didn't match his.The action sequences were handled poorly as well. When Bruce is going after Strickland after the helicopter crash, he does way too much jumping around. They went for big visuals and ignored the lack of situational sense. One 40-yard jump would be enough to get across that he has a FBI pursuit-model surrogate. Taking 5 minutes to catch a mere human just made me conclude that he doesn't really know how to use one. (If you have the muscle strength to jump 40 yards, you should be able to run 30-40mph; so I was expecting him to do a super-speed run to catch up in like 10 seconds after his first jump -- not do slow, lengthy jump after slow, lengthy jump.)The scene where Bruce was chasing after his partner's surrogate had CG physics that reminded me of Catwoman. Not as glaringly bad, but still noticeably off. There's just no excuse for breaking audience immersion with bad physics in this day and age.Surrogates (2009): Not enough action to be mindlessly fun. As a detective story, the crime doesn't evoke any anger (spoiled rich kid gets offed in a case of mistaken identity); and the plot underneath just doesn't connect. For futuristic sci-fi, they completely fail to explore the uses of the technology. (No flying avatars? No Furries? I know that I'd be stomping around in a Mad Cat Mech.) As any sort of metaphor for technology use, it completely falls flat.Bruce Willis saves this movie from being a complete travesty. You can just watch his character and ignore that the journey makes no sense.4/10. If you're flipping through channels and happen to find Surrogates, it won't hurt you to sit though it. But you wouldn't be missing anything by skipping it, either.",Surrogates
221,vitalyx,Mildly entertaining,6,24 September 2009,"Watched this movie today and left the cinema a bit disappointed. While I liked Bruce's performance for the most part, I can't say that about the play of other actors. The movie failed to established an emotional bond between me and the characters except for the protagonist and his wife. While action sequences are good and thrilling, the story isn't very deep and with a few corny moments. Also, for the film that's telling us about the future, it looks too much like the present day, which prevents immersion. Paper files, cars, computer user interfaces and the environment itself - all is telling you, it's 2009, not 2054. The movie is worth watching if you like Bruce Willis (I do), otherwise it's too shallow and unoriginal. To end on a good note, I will agree with the first reviewer - the movie does make you feel good when you are walking out of the cinema, because you are you and not a surrogate :)",Surrogates

I don't know if they cut scenes out or what, but the movie left me wishing they had developed the story a bit more. For example they could have given a little more interaction or explanation about the relationship between Tom and his wife. Many plot segments could have benefited from just a little more time. Oh well, being a sci-fi fan I liked it anyway. Bruce Willis was good as usual. Maybe when it comes out on video the story will be different. Maybe the video release will have a ""director's cut"" with additional scenes to fill the gaps. Overall I give it a 7 out of 10.",Surrogates
223,pcox-mail,Entertaining story in technologically inconsistent environment,3,26 December 2009,"Don't spend too much time or money on this movie if you are bothered by seriously inconsistent or unrealistic science in a science-fiction movie. Despite great production values and acting, the film is marred by a badly imagined technological world.A world technologically capable of producing robotic avatars that convey complete sensory experiences to the users would not, as the world in this film does, resemble early 21st century in every other meaningful way. The technology necessary to accomplish such remote direct brain interface control and sensing is so advanced on so many levels; it would, by definition, be accompanied by other equally huge changes in technology.In Surrogates, the world is basically ""ceteris paribus"" but for one enormous mind-bogglingly advanced change. We would expect, for example, far more advanced robotics in other areas, such as dangerous occupations such as law enforcement and tedious occupation such as low level sales. Yet there is no evidence of this in the film.Similarly, the notion that the entire world's robotic avatars would be susceptible to a one-point attack is simply too absurd. The Web today has multiple redundancies in terms of DS servers as well as other protocols. Corporations and governments maintain multiple backups for important functions, with several levels of Internet available only to high level academic and military users. That a similar level of sophistication doesn't exist in Surrogate's world, despite having an economy dependent on the technology, is too implausible.I can suspend my disbelief with the best of them, but the suspension necessary to enjoy Surrogates comes at too high a cost.",Surrogates
224,praswistiadi,OK. thats it.,5,2 October 2009,"There is just something wrong with sci-fi movie that i don't understand. First surrogates has Bruce Willis (big fan), a picture of the future world, a movie about ""maybe"" the end of the world (love this kind of flick). From the many reason, i would've have easily like this movie. Surrogates is the type of film, that at first i'm very eager to watch, but in the end it only left me with ""mmm its OK"". After watching this movie, i felt the same way as i watched Will Smith's I'Robot or Charlize Theron Aeon Flux or Ewan Mcgregor's The Island. It also have the same characteristics with surrogates. Surrogates is the type of film, that at first i'm very eager to watch, but in the end it only left me with ""mmm its OK"". I think the problem with this type of future sci fi movie is that present movie makers or story tellers can't really make good movie with the end of the world that involves robot or clones. Because, for me, there are a lot of movie talking about the end of the future but involves zombie or alien that is really good. But if it involves robot, i haven'n any one worth watching again and again.Oh yeah, for surrogates, is action packed, easily guessed, Bruce Willis acting was OK, very serious, corny funny (funny because laughing at the some of the flick), very short (under 2 hours, i was shocked), and just OK.",Surrogates
225,draikinator,"It's too bad, since I wanted to like this movie.",1,26 September 2009,"I really, really did want to like this movie. I went into the theater excited, hoping to see a movie with some decent plot that MIGHT just touch on some issues in humanity.This is not what I saw.I was sorely disappointed by the over-done action scenes that took away from the basic 'plot,' of the story, if you could say it had one to begin with. The story was very hard to follow on many parts, and on other, it was only for the gullible. The random, spontaneous and sometimes stupid plot twists had be sick to my stomach within the first half hour, and especially by it's conclusion.And though I was willing to accept many of the idiotic twists and turns this movie took concerning the protagonist's family life, or the side characters relevance to the plot, it was the ending that really got to me. The entire investigation that the movie was about was started because people were dying while connected. Because the 'virus program' that the gun 'shot' at the surrogates somehow overrode the fail safes and 'liquified their brains.' But when the program went worldwide and the protagonist made the very confusing and monumentally anti climatic decision NOT to stop the virus that was being broadcast to every surrogate in the world, that little fact was forgotten. Everyone exited their houses, happy and alive, astounded by the world around them and strangely ready to give up their lovely surrogates.The story was unfounded in logic, the plot was confusing, and the characters were flat, boring, and nothing more than cookie-cutter. In all regards, watching this film may have been one of the biggest wastes of my life I've ever experienced.",Surrogates
226,leadercobra,"Surrogates solid, thought provoking film",7,23 September 2009,"I went to an advance showing of Surrogates tonight and while it starts out a bit silly I ended up really liking it. The films strives for the mock realism of district nine but ends up falling short of that level of intensity. I have not read the graphic novel upon which the film is based, however knowing it's a multi part graphic novel is a bit odd since the film in incredibly short. I believe it clocks in at less than an hour and a half long. Rarely do I feel that the climax is reached TOO quickly in a film but everything seems to fall into place with little explanation as too how the characters know what's going on other than blind luck.The movie sees Tom, played by Bruce Willis as a cop whose living through a surrogate. Think i-Robot but with less tension between the humans and the robots. Surrogates function in a way that humans can lie down with caps over their eyes and neurologically control attractive, boring versions of themselves. Curiously, Tom's surrogate is a cop with a blond comb over. Tom however is growing tired of relying on his surrogate. He wants to see his wife more often...his real wife.In one of the film's many plot holes, a vagrant ""meatbag"" human (one who is against the idea of surrogates) uses a ""device"" to kill surrogates which somehow kills humans at the same time by making their brains exploded. If that sounds convoluted...that's because it is. There's many things in this film left unexplained including that aspect as well as the need for surrogates in the first place. Why bother? These thoughts are quickly erased once Tom is on a chase to find out who is trying to kill surrogates and why.The film has a very fast pace like I said above with from the point of action to the climax very little digression. Within the title crawl you already what surrogates are, what their purpose is and the history of the surrogates. I wish they could slow down a bit and discuss more of the mentality behind the process, but I suppose that's up to the audience to decide.Surrogates is a film that made me happy to be alive as I walked out and thought about it. It's an entertaining film but I can't help but feel that it falls into the same lines of action/drama/sci fi movies as recent ones like The Happening, I am Legend and i-Robot. It's definitely that kind of movie and if you enjoy that, then it won't disappoint.",Surrogates
227,doobleg,Writing a more convenient future...,2,28 September 2009,"'Surrogates' is a film that shows how the introduction of a new technology has radically changed the world we know. This new technology, which is freely available to everyone, has brought the crime rate down to almost zero, and united humanity in ways never before imagined, leaving a few filthy hard-line rednecks to wave the flag against progress.So! What is wrong with this picture? Rather than think about what would REALLY happen with everyone using robots to do everything, the writers of this film have created their own reality for the sake of convenience. For example:Why would giving everyone a mind-controlled robot to play with reduce crime? The robots allow anyone to do ANYthing, so surely EVERYone would be doing EVERYthing! Life would suddenly be like Grand Theft Auto. Also, while everyone's using their robot, they're practically asleep in their own homes, so home invasions and other related crimes have never been easier. - How does everyone get a robot? You *know* the poor ain't getting' one, but apparently abject poverty is no barrier to joining the robot revolution. - Why can't the FBI fly over the redneck camp? They can hack into people's robot feed and shut them down legally within 20 seconds, but fly a helicopter over some hippie's love circle? Forget about it, Willis, hand over your badge and gun.And now, my other problems with this film:the entire film was shot on a dutch tilt (i.e. the camera is askew; this device normally indicates something wrong in a scene). I noticed this about thirty minutes in, and after an hour I realised the director was probably trying to say something about his world (i.e. 'this world ain't right') and would likely have the camera right itself in the closing scenes. Sure enough, when Willis makes amends with his wife, the camera goes level, so all is right with the world once more.This is the most pretentious conceit I have seen in film in a long time. Yes, a director must communicate through the language of film, but an entire movie on the dutch tilt is someone saying 'Look at me! I'm saying something important!'Why didn't the bad guys send hit men or ninjas or something to James Cromwell's house and just kill him for real? He's in a wheelchair, so it ain't like he's going to outrun a ninja. So much simpler than using a super secret weapon and blah blah blah. Plus, the ninja could make it look like an accident or natural causes. - Why did James Cromwell commit suicide right before seeing everyone else die? And why a cyanide capsule? He had a perfectly good gun right there! - James Cromwell (in robot form) just happened to sneak into Radha Mitchell's house and see the EXACT MOMENT of recorded footage that would tell him how kill everyone on the planet? What are the freakin' ODDS of this, people? - We've got instantaneous mind control over robots that are miles (if not hundreds of miles) away, and yet we still use USB?

228,tysonmorris2008,Almost a Good Movie,4,30 June 2010,"I think I'm one of the few people who really liked Terminator 3, so my respect for Mostow's talent is indisputable. But, despite some interesting attempts at profundity, this film, The Surrogates, never compelled me, never quite entertained me.And I think I know why.First and foremost, it doesn't let me sink my teeth into the vapid moral wasteland that is this future earth. Rather, it bunny hops around through a series of vignettes, sort of glimpsing the darker aspects of an all-virtual society but never drawing us into that society. Its reminiscent of the fake landscapes in Total Recall and iRobot, which struggle earnestly to show off the wacky wild high tech future of our world, without successfully capturing the humanity of it. Witness the goofy Dred Camp, whose angry denizens seem like one dimensional caricature's of the empathetic outlaws. From their wardrobe to their dialogue, they are background action, at best. And the backdrop of the movie as a whole only gets worse from there.The Surrogates, plainly speaking, doesn't portray the fleshed out scenarios that we find in, say, Gattacca or The Matrix -- two films, which brilliantly show us just how ugly the super duper future can be.So why do I belabor my criticism of this film... if it's such a bad attempt at social sci-fi? Because it had potential. I do really enjoy Bruce Willis' performances of late. And a Blade-Runner-running-wild concept seems like an easy box office triumph.But the plot is contrived. The drama between husband and wife is directed quite clumsily. And the main enemy is forced upon us like the rough draft of a bad TV show. Moreover, some of the effects look pretty lame in light of what's being done with such low budget movies like District 9 and the $5 million dollar Moon, visual triumphs which render any big budget venture's FX lapse inexcusable.",Surrogates

The concept of Surrogates may seem similar to the concept of virtual society in the recently released movie 'Gamer'. But this movie is definitely a more refined version with indeed a social message. The plot is nothing exceptional, but OK. The running time is perfectly suited for the movie and i personally didn't feel the movie was rushed up.

I mean, who wouldn't want to just lay at home while someone else does everything for you? Or you could just hire a maid. In true Bruce Willis form, he delivers an action packed performance full of intrigue and mystery. If this is what we have to look forward to in the future, sign me up.

I believe it deserves neither fulsome praise nor vitriol, as it is a somewhat better than average film betrayed by bad choices.I'll keep this short: The concept is decent, the execution is mediocre, the result is that I give it 7 out of 10 stars.I would have graded this far higher had the creators spent more time making several of the characters more human (which is funny, given that ""humanity"" as compared to a more machine-like existence is a core concept of the screenplay), but they didn't. The only character in the film who achieves anything like true humanity is Bruce Willis', and this occurs only because the plot requires it.When a film's construction and leverage depend on the very definition of humanity as it's core concept, leaving the humanity of most of the characters behind is something more than stupid -- it cripples the film.This doesn't mean the film is unwatchable; it has enough elements of action, pathos, suspense & revenge to make it worth your time throughout.But it could have been so much better, if not for so many poor choices.",Surrogates

235,clarrizzz,Seven out of Ten,7,19 October 2009,"A cross between the stoically painted ""Sims"" livelihood and a disastrous subversion from ""The Terminator"", we get: Surrogates. This sci-fi flick shows a seemingly perfect but vapid world filled with flawlessly soignée robots that are vicariously living the daily quotidian affairs of their owners. These synthetic humans are neurally controlled by their couch potato human counterparts in the comforts of their own home. The dreams of every homosexual come true in this shallow and synthetic surrogated society where everybody looked like they stepped out of a GQ or Sports Illustrated Magazine.Jonathan Mostow speculatively elicited a microcosm of the society itself of today's time. The juxtaposition between the eerie but plausible Surrogates and the formidable Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines has certain commonness since they are both directed by Mostow. Starrer Bruce Willis plays as a flawless yet apathetic looking agent Tom Greer and partnered with an also perfectly exquisite looking woman with porcelain skin in the light of day. Rosamund Pike portrays as Maggie, Willis' significant other that is surrogate-addicted and works as a hairdresser applying touch ups to the overly maintained facades of the surros.The movie's tone educes thraldom to the over-reliance with machines. In a pervious world like ours, indomitable discoveries have inundated our society as science continues to grow rapidly. Thus, makes Surrogates the product of the feasible upshot of technology.Surely we expect a Bruce Willis movie to be an action-packed, adrenaline rushed, clock ticking suspense flick and Surrogates managed to promise the anticipations within a breezy 88 minutes.",Surrogates

Next thing - I'm a sucker for sci-fi movies AND Bruce Willis brand made me see what's going on. About the movie - Surrogates ( robots themselves ) reminded me of ""I, Robot"" - I guess I'm not the only one feeling this similarity. Plot wasn't exactly too strong but was good enough and didn't fall apart during the movie - that's a plus. Bruce Willis - there's something about this guy - can't really say what it is though - each and every time when he's beaten up in a movie it adds something really special to it ;) His acting was not as good as in e.g ""6th Sense"" but still good. About FX - there were few dumb mistakes, nevertheless overall experience was really nice. My rating is 7 stars - had to take some for running time - movie was actually short ,and left me unsatisfied in some way.",Surrogates

It was pretty much far from this. It was great to see Bruce Willis back on screen in this sci-fi action, and also has a pretty strong cast, parts played by ""Ving Rhames"" and ""Michael Cudlitz"" who hasn't really done much for me since his amazing role in ""Band Of The Brothers"" .Surrogates takes us away into the idea that humans can image themselves younger, by using a machine to create a younger version of ourselves, which we can just walk around in. This takes drastic affect on the world, and also on Bruce Willi's life as he hasn't spoken or seen his real wife in over a decade as she is so hooked to her younger self.After watching this film I think Bruce Willis is still waiting for something more, a bigger better more epic film than this. Without him in this film I believe it would have been tucked under the carpet, and maybe even straight to DVD. Would I watch this film twice ? No, But would I want to miss it ? defiantly not.",Surrogates

Therefore I walked into the theater blind, with mild expectations. I was not disappointed. Surrogates is an entertaining action flick with an interesting plot & concept. (and I'm sure I'm not the first to say it's a little reminiscent of I, Robot.)In this film humanity can live their lives from home thanks to incredibly advanced technology that makes it possible for one to control their own humanoid robotic puppet (surrogate) from a chair. In this world there is no disease, no pain, and crime rates have dropped drastically.FBI agent Tom Greer (Bruce Willis) investigates the first murder in 15 years: a young man who was killed along with his surrogate. He then discovers the existence of a dangerous weapon and has to discontinue the use of his own surrogate to try to figure out what is going on, risking his life while being the only human roaming the streets.The action in this movie was pretty good, the acting and dialogue were okay.

The special effects were nice, the acting was good (I like Bruce Willis in most of his films anyway). But the idea in the end....terrible! Actually the makers of this film are not to blame, they only showed us once again that there are so many narrow-minded people in this world, they would destroy all ""unconventional"" technology, even if there are obvious advantages to it, just to keep us in the boundaries of a ""normal"" life (but who are they to say what is normal and not, we as a race, don't know almost nothing about ourselves...) That crappy idea ""Oh, my God, technology is bad!"" No, it's not, WE as humans are bad, WE make technological improvements and WE can use them to destroy or to create. So, in the end, basically the guy destroys the technology just because he has issues with his wife (but who can tell they don't get a ""real"" divorce, real enough even without surrogates :))) Anyway, I was raged at the ending. Because IF such technology were possible, and IF would stay in the right hands, what a life could we experience!",Surrogates

Sorry to tell you but not in this movie.. First of all, the parents who lost a child is becoming a bad cliché. If the scriptwriters want us to identify with the character they must find a new way besides of dramatic loss of a child. The dialogues are very insipid, especially between greer(willis)and his wife. The characters are shallow, they don't allow audience to identify and get excited. Bruce Willis is again a loser(in personal life) detective(as John McClane), I love McClane but he must get over it sometime. I also have a question to directors: Can you shoot an action movie without 'You have 10 sec, hurry' scene? And a wish: If you can, please do it! And the finishing is also lame, I'm sure director is thinking he's a genius after the cut, but i don't agree. The best thing in the movie is Ving Rhames with his dreadlocks.",Surrogates

Bruse Willis who can usually add a little spark to most characters he plays, with a wry smile, or a witty quip, is uniformly deadpan in this role, and the same robotic behaviour, from humans and robots alike made it hard to empathise with any of the characters in this story.It was pedestrian at best, and for a movie that could easily have been so much more, it was rather disappointing.

The idea behind the movie and the actors picked to play the roles gave me high hopes for a great movie. However, after finishing the movie, I was left feeling unsatisfied. I felt that the movie went by to quick and that the plot was rushed. I think if they would have either made the movie longer and explained the plot more, or if they would have just got rid of some of the twists and explained it better, it would have made the movie better. I am not going to say that it is a bad movie, that is not really my place, but I will say that I did not find it that that good.

This should not occur, so Willys is asked to find what happened.The idea provides space for some twists along the movie (although these twists aren't surprising).The sci fi effects are decent.The movie, though, has some issues when it comes to scenifying the future: 1) it's the future, we have robots and awesome stuff, and yet they still USB flash drives (I would expect som superior information storage technology... maybe a transparent plastic) and LCD screens (holographic technology, anyone?). 2) in one scene you see the US army going to a battle zone with Chinook helicopters!!!! (those used to carry troops in the Vitenam war!!!). What the hell? 3) although the surrogates are hi-tech (?) robots, they need to reload their battery after 12 hours (even my cell phone can stand more than 48 hours before a battery change).4) I wonder how it is possible that 99% of human race can reload its surrogates without creating a world energy cisis 5) do you imagine people in Somalia or either in the rest of Africa not being able to eat but, at the same time, have a surrogate? don't you think that 99% of the human race using a battery-operated tin can to live their life is sort of exaggerated?5) With the great advance in bionics, biotechnology and medicine, why would anyone wish to have a robot? why bother buying 240 pounds of metal when you can have all sorts of implants (in a short future) that may enhance all your organic functions?

256,pacson78,Surrogates Gets Funner As It Plods Along,7,24 June 2010,"Nowadays, most movies start with a bang and end with a whimper. Today's filmmakers tend to be great starters but weak closers, conjuring more conflict than they have creativity to resolve. Luckily, Surrogates, directed by Die Hard 4 helmer Jonathan Mostow, builds in drama and inventiveness as it moves along its course, taking us ultimately to a satisfying enough conclusion. Starting in a world inhabited by androids, called surrogates, operated remotely by humans has a chilling effect on the first quarter of the film. The surrogates are played with a distinct sense of separation. Although this acting decision works in the world of the movie, it does make it difficult for the audience to connect with any of the characters initially. Thankfully, the movie becomes more interesting as we see the juxtaposition the surrogates and their owners. A hot blond, for example, turns out to actually be bald and morbidly obese. Bruce Willis' character, Tom Greer, is a smooth-skinned pretty boy with a full head of hair as a surrogate. The real Tom is bald, whiskered, and grizzled. This is where the fun begins, as well as the thought-provoking connections between the online social media we enjoy and the surrogates of the movie. Ultimately, this film is a scathing critique on our new avatar- based culture. Once Tom wrecks his surrogate and is forced to forge ahead in his real body, the audience is able to connect with him and his awakening to the evils of the surrogate craze. The film finally finds its rhythm in a chase scene between Tom and a female surrogate through Boston traffic. When Tom mows down a sidewalk full of surrogates like orange caution cones, you don't know whether to laugh or gasp. Regardless, you know you've entered a genuine movie fun house. Surrogates gets more fun and inventive as it plods along. If anything, it suffers from pacing that feels a little off rhythm and a script that feels like the writers didn't discover the depth of their material until halfway through their final draft. Production values are adequate but could have been slightly more convincing with a bigger budget.",Surrogates
257,mcse-885-191382,"In a society that parallels ours, robotic extensions of people has become common place.",8,31 October 2010,"In a society that parallels ours, but is an alternate reality, the use of Surrogates, robotic extensions of people has become common place. There is no longer any real crime to speak of, no injustices upon a person occur. People live their lives through their surrogate, having no more fear of sickness, or even death. Surrogates, starring Bruce Willis as FBI Agent Tom Greer, Radha Mitchell as Agent Greer's partner Jennifer Peters, James Cromwell as Cantor, the inventor/Creator of the surrogate devices, implies that even when things fell like perfection, there are always imperfections, dangers, lurking hidden in the shadows.Agent Tom Greer works for the FBI along with his partner, Jenn Peters. Greer is called to the scene of an automobile accident and soon discovers that a surrogate has been deactivated in a most unusual way. As the investigation deepens, the agents discover that whatever destroyed the surrogates, also killed there operators, which is not supposed to be possible. The agents soon have their first homicide investigation since the inception of the surrogates. What unfolds is a tale of suspense, mystery, and several well played plot twists leading down an unlikely path and possibly ending in all surrogates violent deactivation and all operators being killed, literally billions of deaths. Agent Greer and his partner, Peters, must stop this from occurring at all costs.The film Surrogates uses many common cinematic elements to aid the audience in experiencing the plot and theme of the film, elements such as lighting, camera angles, and soundtrack, to produce a high cinematic quality film with a strong sense of a suspense action thriller. I am reminded of I, Robot, as Surrogates has a very similar plot and theme, as well as a closely related story and cinematography. The use of lighting techniques works well in Surrogates as in the case of the operators, who remain safe at home in their ""stem chairs"" while operating their surrogates. The operators are typically bathed in red light as they are online with their devices, and their rooms are dark and not otherwise well lit. This implied to me a sense of foreboding and dread for the operators. The red light used gives them a finality that normally would not be sensed in normal light. Conversely, as the operators disconnect from their surrogates, they are bathed in a normal color of light, indicating to me that they are out of danger as long as they are not using their surrogates.I was overall very pleased with this film and would recommend that anyone should see it. It is a testament to modern suspense/murder mystery film-making with a modern flare for dramatic effect. The story did not disappoint and had many turns and cliffhangers, the effects were excellent, giving the film a very modern science/fiction feel, and the theme was excellent to support the story and characters.",Surrogates
258,eifler121,"Decent, if you like I Robot, good pick",5,19 April 2011,"Surrogates is a sci-fi movie based on a graphic-novel. It stars Bruce Willis, Ving Rhaimes, and James Cromwell. It takes place in a somewhat near-future in which people live most of their lives through surrogate, robotic bodies. They can feel everything their surrogate would feel if it were a living human, and experience things that would normally be dangerous without the fear of any pain. They can even be killed as a surrogate, and continue living.The story revolves around Bruce Willis' ""character;"" a detective with a Bruce Willis-ey kind of personality who is somewhat skeptic of the use of Surrogates. Willis' character is running an investigation on a murdered surrogate. Only this time, the user has been killed as well with the use of a new electro-weapon. The user just so happens to be the son of the inventor of surrogates, Cromwell. This leads Willis to Rhaimes' character, the leader of an anti-surrogate, and sometimes radical group. The mystery unravels and suddenly unexpected suspects arise. Overall, it's an alright movie. I like Bruce Willis, so it was entertaining for me. It sort of plays out like a not as good version of I Robot, and even has James Cromwell in it too. I would give it a 5, but 5 seems bad to some people. It certainly is NOT a must-see, but it isn't a horrible movie either. It might be a little bit too violent for younger kids, there's a club scene at the beginning, and it covers the idea that some people would use this technology to pretend to be someone else. There is also some language. I'd say an R rating would be too high, PG too light, but possibly appropriate for more lenient parents.",Surrogates
259,adrienne-bradley,Thought provoking and interesting,6,29 April 2012,"Set in a futuristic world, where beauty and safety rival freedom, the movie Surrogates details the burden of one cop who struggles to bring down the system. In a world where seeing is believing, robotic versions of people live their lives, take everyday risks and interact with each other. Humans stay home strapped to video game like controllers, never feeling the true intimacy and emotion of other people.Actor Bruce Willis, (Detective Greer) attempts to rekindle his marriage with actress Rosamund Pike (Maggie,) after the tragic death of their only child. He tries desperately to recapture his humanity, to end the world puppetry, and to live a life where people again roam the streets flaws and all. This he finds is no easy task, as everyone has grown comfortable with the new way of life. Completely alone, beaten, and surrogate free, Greer soon realizes that the people he worked so closely with, and the people he trusted are the one's that he should fear. Throughout the film, the viewer is transported light years forward via the costumes and settings that take place. All though it is a modern day New York look, the stores are amped up with neon lighting, bright colors and space age like interiors. Motion activated ads line the streets, speaking to the people as their surrogates stroll by. The computers, lasers, and graphic image overlays they use to identify the difference between the human beings and surrogates can easily amaze one. The makeup and hair on the robotic version of the people is flawless, perfect skin, perfect curls, perfect shading and wrinkle free. Even the soldier's uniforms and weaponry shine as if just recently made. In contrast, the humans show their flaws as if they were shot with rough grain film every pore, every line, every misplaced hair exaggerated by the perfection of everyone else. After watching the film, one begins to ponder whether or not the world could actually get to the extreme isolation that is portrayed. With such a high focus on the beauty industry, and technology, it almost seems capable. Overall I found the film to be interesting and thought provoking.",Surrogates

Willis turns in an understated, powerful performance and is ably supported by the rest of the under written cast. The plot is thin, and the few twists are easy to see coming. When a film tilts around a central concept (here a frankly unbelievable 98% of the world population – has all of Africa and Asia been industrialised? - use Surrogate robots to interact with each other) it needs to be thoroughly thought through and interrogated for believability. Surrogates fails this test. Throughout the film a series of ""What about?"" and ""Why is that?"" questions ran through my head. The audience is asked to accept an awful lot on faith, not least a finale in which the practical consequences of what occurs are rather brushed aside.A world of Surrogates would be a fascinating, challenging place.

If that would have been the only thing that it was supposed to offer, I would give it much more positive vote. So, if you like sci-fi and are planning to go to the cinema to relax and have fun - go for it.However, I'm very disappointed with numerous background details that were supposed to make the shown sci-fi world more realistic, but due to terrible lack of thought, spoiled the movie experience for me. It almost seems like someone was given a rough sketch of this great idea of a world where humans interact with each other through surrogates (I honestly think it's a fantastic base for great movie or series of books) and than wrote a film script for it in one day.Almost each and every detail showing how the world looks after the surrogates revolution seems like written by a kid (perhaps for kids?) or by someone very naive. Alternative sci-fi universes are great - a huge number of them is very rich and very well constructed. But here, I can't even imagine a good sci-fi book written based on such ridiculous concepts as those proposed in Surrogates movie.If you look closely, you will see the same lack of thought and logic in many other concepts in the movie (eg. the way FBI works).The plot, the 'fine touches' added to the script are so shallow that instead of enhancing the movie experience, they just make you raise your eyebrows in disbelief.What this movie offers:* Great concept of human surrogates* Good action* Bruce Willis, who in my opinion is one of the best sci-fi and action movies actor* James Cromwell in a very fitting, well played roleWhat you won't experience:* deep and compelling sci-fi alternative universe* logic* well written ending (not that that's something unusual in this type of movies...)",Surrogates
