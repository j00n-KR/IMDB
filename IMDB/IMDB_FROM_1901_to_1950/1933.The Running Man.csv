0,MartinHafer,"for what it is, an excellent film",7,1 June 2006,"I'm pretty surprised that this film is rated as low on IMDb as it is--especially since this is one of Arnold's better films. I think part of the problem is that some people MIGHT be looking at the film from a superficial and purely aesthetic level, whereas I see a lot more depth in this movie than many viewers. Yes the film is violent and dopey but that's exactly the point! Just like the original (and only one worth watching) ROLLERBALL, the film was dismissed by some because of the film's violence and seeming banality whereas the film really is a great indictment about society. And, on that level, the film is great. I could actually see people in our country, especially in the near future, intoxicated by the violence of a show dedicated to watching men die. Is this really that much of a leap from Jerry Springer and the evening news? And, if you look at the film technically, it's well-made. Arnold is just fine with this role, the direction is great, Steven King's story is excellent and Richard Dawson just steals the show as the sleazy and creepy host of this show dedicated to making capital punishment a spectator sport! So, try watching this film and think to yourself--could this really make it on TV? I think YES, as our world really isn't that far removed from the Romans and their Coliseums.UPDATE--I just saw this movie again and I think my original review was too optimistic. While I had given it a 9, now I think 6 or 7 is probably more accurate. While I agree there is some good social commentary, the film had too many holes and silly plot points when I saw it again. Still, not bad brain candy.",The Running Man
1,Leofwine_draca,"Arnie's campiest movie, and it works perfectly as a comedy",7,4 November 2016,"A camp, incredibly cheesy and dated '80s movie with Schwarzenegger, yet it's still a lot more fun than RAW DEAL. If you wanted one film that epitomised the cheesiness of the '80s then this would be a good film to look at. Although the title is taken from a Stephen King story (writing under his usual Richard Bachman pseudonym), this film actually succeeds in ripping off Joe D'Amato's ENDGAME and other Italian post-apocalyptic movies; it's not often that American films rip off their Italian counterparts so this makes an exception.In this particular futuristic world, class is divided by those who work for the government and those who don't (and live lives of grime in the streets below). Into this world comes Arnie, who is betrayed by his employers and thrown into a prison camp. Prisoners have a metal necklace which explodes if they try to escape, leading to a cool exploding head scene a la SCANNERS. Obviously the makers of FORTRESS liked this idea as they used a similar one in their film, except the explosive was in the stomach instead of the neck. Of course, being the hulking muscular bloke that he is, Arnie does manage to escape before being unfortunately recaptured on an airport runway. Here, after a slow start, the fun begins.The incredibly slimy Richard Dawson plays Killian, a megalomaniac game show host who wants Arnie for his show. Arnie is forced into submission, thrown into the pit with a couple of his fellow escapees, and must battle a string of amusingly-named and even more amusingly-attired villains. Eventually, he beats the system, exposes the truth, infiltrates the television show and wipes out all of the bad guys in time for a cheesy happy ending. What more could you want? A little intelligence perhaps? Nope, sorry, you've come to the wrong place. This is out-and-out dumb entertainment. Sure, there is the occasional glimpse of intelligence (I liked the idea of previous ""winners"" who supposedly went to live in Hawaii, but whose corpses are found rotting in an underground room) but for the majority of it, this film just consists of out-and-out action.Schwarzenegger here indulges in his cheap, predictable one-liners (as in COMMANDO) which I still manage to get a kick out of. Maria Cochita Alonso is the female lead and lends some Latin spirit to the proceedings, with her agreeably-tough female fighter not having to get rescued too often by Arnie. Old hand Yaphet Kotto stars as Arnie's pal, and while it's sad to see him in a tight bodysuit, his presence nonetheless manages to upgrade the film a little. I've never seen him looking so out of place though. However, it is the cast who make up the bad guys who are of the most interest. Aside from Dawson's slimy game show host, we have blaxploitation star Jim Brown as ""Fireball"", who ends up igniting himself; Professor Toru Tanaka as ""Subzero"", who gets strangled with barbed wire, Gus Rethwisch going way over the top as ""Buzzsaw"", who gets sliced in two between the legs (ouch!) and finally Jesse Ventura (who's now gone political, believe it or not) as ""Captain Freedom"", who isn't really an adversary but who just stands around being annoying.The action scenes pass the time, but lack finesse. It's just a case of ""point the camera and shoot"", although Arnie fighting is always good for a chuckle. I thought the ending to be a bit lacklustre too, but that may be down to budget constraints. One thing I did like was the set design, which convincingly creates a grime-strewn future world full of crumbling buildings, decaying rubbish and the like. At least it looks good. THE RUNNING MAN is definitely worth watching to see what kind of films they made in the '80s, but the Italian films that inspired this are even funnier AND more cheesy, if that's even possible.",The Running Man
2,SnoopyStyle,Schwarzenegger and Richard Dawson make it fun,6,8 December 2013,"Set in 2017, the world is a dystopic totalitarian society. Ben Richards (Arnold Schwarzenegger) is a cop who refused an order to fire on civilians. He is then framed for the massacre and imprisoned. He escapes in a prison break. But then he gets ratted out by Amber Mendez (Maria Conchita Alonso). Damon Killian (Richard Dawson) is the game host of 'The Running Man' where convicted felons are given the chance to run for freedom. He wants a guy like Ben Richards to run his course.It actually took quite a long while to get to the Running Man. I had forgotten about that. The pacing suffers because of it. The style is strictly 80s cheese gone insane. If it wasn't for Schwarzenegger and Richard Dawson, this wouldn't be as much fun as it actually was. Dawson is the perfect sleazy game show host. It's like his second nature. And we are talking about Arnold Schwarzenegger in his prime. It has good cheese value.",The Running Man
3,kosmasp,Runnin - Runnin,8,16 October 2020,"The 80s ... well the movies from the 80s depicting the future (aka what we know as now - sometimes even has passed, see Back to the Future). A couple of things they imagined back then actually did come to fruition one way or the other. I reckon they asked some people who knew some things that were in development. On the other hand, some movies did not care about little things like hairdos ... like this one! The hairstyle of the future did not change according to this movie ... but you may call this nitpicking, so let's concentrate on the important things.And that was the social message and criticism those movies had. Rollerball was way before this and in a way extreme in some senses. But this us about a show of survival, rather than hiding violence in a sports game. We also get the wrongfully accused, the stubborn hero, who's pushed into this role and a bit of a love story. Arnold does what Arnold has to do, but he has quite the stellar cast surrounding him. Good people doing their best. The movie has aged quite well too, with maybe a few pacing issues when it comes to viewing pleasures nowadays, but otherwise more than decent. The filmmakers took notice of Japanese TV shows back then ... and US and Western TV took notice of it too with a lot of ""reality"" TV offsprings. I'd rather watch this movie then any TV show that pretends to offer me reality though ...",The Running Man
4,classicsoncall,"""The truth hasn't been very popular lately"".",7,5 December 2009,"Interesting - the movie is set in 2017 - the world economy has collapsed, television is controlled by the State, and no dissent is tolerated. Move that timetable up by eight years and you pretty much have the current state of the country. The clue to how prescient this movie was is that there's absolutely no mention of global warming. Obviously, the writers and film makers were only dealing with reality.So you have ""The Running Man"", depicting a dystopian society that has taken celebrity status to the zenith of empty headed and pointless mass approbation. It's fitting I guess, that if an Administration seeks to isolate a particular network attempting to practice real journalism, then television entertainment would be put under the aegis of the Justice Department. Ben Richards' partners are shown being sent off to Hawaii (Guantanomo detainees to Bermuda anyone?); and say, didn't that scene where Richards and Amber Mendez make it through the security line remind you of the Salahi's getting into a state dinner? I couldn't have mentioned these things only a few months ago, but here we are. Pretty soon, local libraries may find they have to move this picture from the general viewing category over into the documentary section.One thing is certain, ""The Running Man"" has one of the most eclectic casts in the history of film - where else would you see Arnold and Richard Dawson in the same flick? Yaphet Kotto, Maria Conchita Alonso, Jim Brown? Who would have guessed back in 1987 that the picture would turn out two future state governors - geez Jesse, was that a wig? And one of my favorites, Professor Toru Tanaka, looking even meaner than in his heyday as World Tag Team Champion with Mr. Fuji. Couldn't they have brought Fuji along for the ride? Which leads me to another question - why aren't there more pro wrestlers in government today? For a futuristic apocalyptic film, this one is just too hopelessly Eighties to be anything but camp, but that's not meant to be a put down. For entertainment value, the picture is priceless, and as I mentioned earlier, the more time goes by, the more realistic it becomes. If you want to catch the first and last glimpses of where we may be headed as a society, ""The Running Man"" is must see. And if you wait long enough, you might be able to catch it on the Discovery Channel.",The Running Man
5,gavin6942,A Sci-Fi Classic,7,4 August 2016,"A wrongly convicted man (Arnold Schwarzenegger) must try to survive a public execution gauntlet staged as a game show.Original director Andrew Davis was fired one week into filming and replaced by Glaser. Schwarzenegger has stated this was a ""terrible decision"" as Glaser ""shot the movie like it was a television show, losing all the deeper themes"". I don't know if this is true or not, as it would be really hard to comment on a version of a film that doesn't exist.I think the themes are still there: the American love of violence, the growing prominence of television and ratings, the distrust of government. Sure, it is covered with a candy shell. Amid the violence, we have some silly characters (Dynamo) and plenty of one-liners. This may have the most Schwarzenegger one-liners in a single film, and they are appropriately awful.",The Running Man
6,jboothmillard,The Running Man,5,31 January 2008,"I had heard about this film a couple of times when I was younger, and I knew the leading actor was in it, I didn't know what it was about though, and that it is based on the novel by Stephen King. Basically, it is the year 2019, the world economy has collapsed (food for example is low). Ben Richards is a cop blamed for a massacre that wasn't his fault, but he manages to escape the high-tech gates of his prison with other inmates, including William Laughlin (Yaphet Kotto) and Harold Weiss (Marvin J. McIntyre). He tries to escape with the help of a woman he dragged along, Amber Mendez (Maria Conchita Alonso), but she turned him over to the authorities. Damon Killian (Richard Dawson), host of the world's most popular game show ""The Running Man"" saw Ben's escape on the news, and he knew he had to have him for the show. The show basically takes serious law breakers (most of the time they purposely exaggerate the crimes) and trained killers hunt them down. Ben is forced into this sick game show, along with William and Harold, and a little later, Amber joins them. They are now all running for their lives as killers, including Professor Subzero (Professor Toru Tanaka), Buzzsaw (Gus Rethwisch), Dynamo (Erland Van Lidth) and Fireball (Jim Brown) come after them. As they are being chased, Ben is obviously the one who kills them all, and they also try to find a way to show Killian's guilt and the true nature of this game show. Also starring Predator's Jesse Ventura a Captain Freedom, Mick Fleetwood as Mic and Dweezil Zappa as Stevie. The story is quite interesting, and Schwarzenegger gets quite a few good one-liners, including the expected ""I'll be back"", an okay futuristic science-fiction action thriller. Worth watching!",The Running Man
7,rmax304823,See You in Reruns.,5,7 June 2009,"The leads in this satirical action movie include a Viennese weightlifter, a Cuban singer, a Dutchman, two African-Americans, an Australian, a Japanese-American, and a pro wrestler from Minneapolis. The choreography is by a Sephardic Jew from the San Fernando Valley. When are we going to get serious about the immigration problem? Eh? It has been argued that if you've seen one Arnold Schwarzenegger action movie from the 1980s, you've seen them all, but that's not quite true. This one is different. Arnold wears a full-body Speedo outfit of orange and blue. You've never seen THAT before.Arnold disobeys an order to fire on unarmed civilian rioters sometime in the future, when the US is being ruled by a government called the Cadre that controls the news, sponsors TV programs, and endorses cartels. The Cadre frames him and coerces him into taking part in a TV program, ""The Running Man,"" hosted by Richard Dawson, famous in the 1980s for hosting shows like ""Family Feud."" Dawson is almost exuberant in public and on the screen. When he's ""off,"" he's slimy and treacherous.Schwarzenegger is to be sent into a maze of tunnels underneath Los Angeles, along with a couple of other dissidents and miscreants. There, in order to achieve a sentence reduction or even a pardon, they must run an obstacle course of technical and more or less human interference. Medical discretion forbids me to reveal the outcome.The violent scenes are stunningly splashy and stupid. People get sawed in half or electrocuted in an explosion of sparks -- that sort of thing. And Arnold's wisecracks in the midst of mayhem are no more than expected. ""Need a lift?"", he asks, throwing somebody off a balcony. ""How about a light?"", he asks, tossing a match into the aura of explosive gas surrounding an adversary. When the adversary blows up -- ""What a hot head."" But I kind of enjoyed the jabs at television and its viewers, and the deceptive government behind them. We've heard of Infomercials. This is a kind of Infonews.When Arnold is arrested, a man enters his cell and announces, ""Hi. I'm your court-appointed theatrical agent."" On the way to the show at which Arnold is to be sacrificed, the agent -- like the priest in any prison movie -- is reading out, not the Bible, but the contract, in legal gobbledygook. The party of the first part agrees to relinquish all rights to reruns and subsequent manuscript and film control, including paperback book sales and associated merchandise.The Cadre also sponsors what we might now call reality shows such as ""Climbing for Dollars,"" in which a contestant with a mouth full of cash tries desperately to climb a tall rope to avoid the horde of blood-thirsty Dobermans howling underneath him, and despite the occasional blasts of knockout gas when he nears the top. When Dawson suffers death by Cadre Cola sign, Arnold remarks, ""That'll hit the spot."" It's all nonsense and there isn't much new but the odd gag may induce a smile.",The Running Man
8,Tweekums,Entertaining if rather dated Schwarzenneger vehicle,7,12 April 2014,Set in a near future where the news is edited to show the 'facts' that the totalitarian regime wants the people to see a police man has been sent to prison for committing a massacre he in fact tried to stop. That policeman is Ben Richards and when he escapes television producer Damon Killian is determined to make his the star of 'The Running Man'. This is a game show where criminals are hunted down and killed by 'stalkers' while the public bet on the outcome. Richards is captured after he is turned in by network employee Amber Mendez and soon finds himself in the game with two fellow escapees. These two are members of the underground movement determined to expose the lies the network is airing so not only do they want to survive they want to find the location of the network's satellite unlink which is inevitably hidden in the game zone. They are soon joined by Amber who was caught trying to find the original footage of the massacre. When these runners start to turn the tables on the stalkers the public start to support them something Killian can't allow so he starts changing the rules and things get even more dangerous for the runners.When I first watched 'The Running Man' back in the eighties I thought it was great stuff with plenty of action and some great one-liners sadly it hasn't aged as well as other Schwarzenneger films of that era like 'The Terminator' or even 'Commando'. The one-liners are just too cheesy and don't sound like lines made up on the spot like a good one-liner should. The action is pretty violent at times even though very little blood is shown; when people get shot with automatic weapons they just fall over without bleeding! Arnie does a good enough job as Richards and Maria Conchita Alonso is fine as Amber but it is Richard Dawson who steals the show as producer/presenter Killian he manages to make this sleazy character the most believable person in the film! Overall this is still quite fun if you don't mind the kitsch; just don't expect a classic.,The Running Man

Special effects laden adaptation of the Stephen King novel , under his Richard Bachman pseud , he wrote the story in 72 hours and was screen-written by Steven Souza , the film is based very loosely on the novel of the same name . The story deals with a futuristic TV game show in which each game are selected some convicts to participate in a brutal man-chase wherein felons are given the chance to run to freedom but have to elude the stalkers ; men who hunt them down and kill them in gruesome manners . 'The Running Man' game seen in the film was based upon an early 1980's Japanese game show called 'Trans American Ultra Quiz', in which contestants were tortured in various ways and the prize went to whichever contestant could stand the pain/humiliation the longest . The movie displays strong and realistic fights and excellent action sequences with bloody attacks and violent , blistering struggles . The picture belong to ¨dystopian world¨ genre as well as the tyrannical control by the government of ¨1984¨ and death games films such as ¨Battle Royale¨ (Kinji Fukasaku) and the recent ¨Hunger Games¨(Gary Ross). Arnold Schwarzenegger is an appropriate and powerful warrior , he steals the spectacle as one army man , as enemies are dispatched in turn ; in addition , he holds the brief comic relief . Dolph Lundgren and Christopher Reeve were interested to star in the movie, and Patrick Swayze had also been considered. Arnold , Governor of California , along with Maria Conchita Alonso have both starred in the Predator movies. Jesse Ventura , Governor of Minnesota , starred in the first Predator film . Ample plethora of secondary actors give bouncing performances as Professor Tanaka , Jim Brown , Yaphet Kotto , Zappa , Fleetwood and Sven-Ole Thorsen . Furthermore , Erland van Lidth's and Richard Dawson's last film. Thrilling and commercial musical score by Harold Faltermeyer , it was composed by means of synthesizer . Colorful and adequate cinematography by Thomas Del Ruth . The motion picture lavishly produced by Rob Cohen was well directed by Paul Michael Glaser (Starsky and Hutch) . Rating : Good . Well worth watching .",The Running Man
10,BA_Harrison,A typical 80s Arnie action flick.,7,2 February 2007,"Set in 2017 (although one might easily mistake it for 1987, judging by the hairstyles and clothing), The Running Man sees all-round good guy Ben Richards (Schwarzeneggar) framed for a crime he didn't commit. After a daring prison break, he is captured and entered as a contestant in the brutal TV game show The Running Man, along with some fellow escapees and the pretty token female, Amber (Maria Conchita Alonso),.Used by the totalitarian government as a way of controlling the masses, the show pits convicts against a range of colourful (and often quite camp) opponents, each having his own unique killing style: Dynamo fires electricity from a special suit, Buzzsaw uses chainsaws, Sub Zero has a razor edged ice hockey stick, and Fireball prefers a flamethrower to finish off contenders. But these killers are no match for Ben Richards, who dispatches each one in a fittingly gruesome manner (followed by the obligatory witticism).Towards the end of the movie, Ben joins a group of freedom fighters in a battle against the authorities, and gets to exact revenge on the show's nasty host, Killian.Twenty years ago, Arnold Schwarzeneggar ruled the action-movie universe and, to his legion of fans, he could do no wrong. The Austrian beefcake had a successful formula that almost guaranteed box office success for his movies: comic book violence plus logic-free plot plus pretty female sidekick plus witty one-liners, minus acting ability equalled massive profits. The Running Man faithfully followed this blockbuster recipe to a T and Arnie's (mostly male teenage) audience lapped it up (myself included).Now, two decades later, and having just finished re-watching the movie for the first time in years, I find it a strange movie: one totally devoid of technical merit, decent acting, and convincing effects, yet somehow totally entertaining. Directed by Paul Michael Glaser (best known as Det. Dave Starsky from cult 70s cop show, Starsky and Hutch), and adapted from a short story by Stephen King (writing under the nom de plume, Richard Bachman), The Running Man is cheesy 80s tat that looks both incredibly cheap and very dated, yet despite (or maybe because of) the film's shoddiness, it has a special charm which is hard to describe.With no attempt at creating a realistic near-future setting, the film provides plenty of unintentional giggles. Check out the scene in which Ben discovers Amber's secret cache of forbidden cassette tapes(!); marvel at the crap 'futuristic' graphics used on advertising billboards and The Running Man board game (as a graphic designer, I found these particularly amusing); be amazed at the distinct lack of convincing technological advancements.The Running Man may be utter rubbish, but it is hugely entertaining utter rubbish that I have no hesitation in recommending to fans of Arnie and sci-fi action in general.",The Running Man
11,paul_haakonsen,"Before there was ""Hunger Games"", there was ""The Running Man""...",6,5 March 2021,"Well, you can't really have been a fan of Arnold Schwarzenegger during the late 1980s and not have seen ""The Running Man"". Yeah, it is one of those iconic movies from the late 1980s.Now, hold your horses, I didn't say it was one of Schwarzenegger's best movies, but it is definitely one of his more memorable movies. Why? Well, because the storyline differed quite a lot from the usual action movies that he made back in the day. And also because ""The Running Man"" is just a completely through and through campy movie... But in a good way.Yeah, I must admit that ""The Running Man"" is one of those guilty pleasure movies. The movie is not great, by any means really. But it is an enjoyable and watchable movie still, because it is so cheesy and campy. And the amount of one-liners thrown around in the dialogue is just hilarious.""The Running Man"" is set in a dystopian 2017 Los Angeles setting. And yeah, you can't help but laugh at what they imagined that L.A. in 2017 would look like in this movie. It was just so far off, but again it was enjoyable because it was so spaced out and goofy.The cast in the movie was actually interesting. I mean, of course you have Arnold Schwarzenegger as the lead actor and the main attraction. And he was joined by the likes of Maria Conchita Alonso, Yaphet Kotto, Jim Brown, Jesse Ventura and Richard Dawson.The stalkers in the movie, the killers hired by the CSI network to hunt down the participants in the Running Man game show are just ridiculous. It was like watching something from a computer game, and the costumes they wore... Wow. You have to watch that to believe it, especially the guy named Dynamo.Now, if you haven't already seen the 1987 movie ""The Running Man"" by director Paul Michael Glaser, then it is one that I would recommend that you sit down to watch, if you find yourself given the opportunity. It is actually an easy-watching movie.My rating of this 1987 movie lands on a six out of ten stars.",The Running Man
12,Quinoa1984,"a true late 80's guilty pleasure, or rather 1987's equivalent of Ghost Rider today",7,21 June 2007,"That one line summary means basically this: if you're looking for a great action movie, look elsewhere, specifically at the other Arnold Schwarzenneger science fiction vehicle Predator from that year. BUT, if you're looking for a comedy, in the campiest and most self-consciously over-the-top (to overuse the phrase) style of the period, look no further for bad puns, classic ""Ah-nuld"" one-liners, and satire ala cheap 10 cent comic-books. I think it was appropriate to go this route considering the star; the producers obviously could have done a more straightforward adaptation of Bachman/King's book, and (having not read it but heard much about it) that might, and could still be, an exciting action flick in the brutally graphic and darkly humorous approach of the author. But the dye was cast as soon as Schwarzenegger was put in the lead, and it's sort of a strange stroke of luck that the writers, production designers, costume designer, musical composer, and supporting cast were put together how they were. It's a period movie, though not entirely of the period of the future. It's of that quintessential 1980s time-warp where the mood and approach is a collision between cartoons and adult action pictures of the period. To put it not so bluntly, it's a gas.Schwarzenneger gets framed for a massacre he didn't commit, put into jail by a typically over-controlling government of the future, where he soon escapes with his fellow inmates, and tries to flee the country with a girl (Maria Conchita Alonso) who is in the apartment his brother used to live. He's caught again, only now under the attention of an uber-greedy TV-show host, Killian (Richard Dawson, oddly terrific as an unadulterated heel), who's show is the Running Man, a game of death where the contestants are thrown one insanely huge and pyrotechnic heavy killer after another. It's almost of more worth that I didn't read the book, I think, because then there would be too much room for comparison. All pretension in this case is thrown out the window, and director Glaser and writer Sousza are just out to make a seriously wacky action comedy in the guise of a living, breathing TV program of it's own (actually, that's part of the bits of actual workable satire, like the little commercials thrown in like the show where a guy is climbing up a rope to stay away from wild animals, or Jesse Ventura's classic bit part as an exercise show host).If I really did have to evaluate the movie on true artistic merit, it would probably not get very high marks as would a Terminator or Total Recall. The story itself is cobbled together from all used parts- the underground fighting to stop the technologically dominant TV power, the lies perpetually perpetrated by Killian and others to distort all facts regarding Schwarzenneger's Ben Richards- and the cut-aways to the audience in many of the battles are only notable for their editing. The Running Man isn't a movie to watch for real personal expression, anyway, but like aforementioned Ghost Rider, maybe even more-so, it's a laugh-riot whether it intends this or not. Surely Schwarzenneger had to grin to himself constantly in-between takes over some of his lines (""I'm not into politics. I'm into survival"" ""here's your Subzero, now plain zero"" ""I'll be back!""), as he had to wedge them during incorrigible fights with characters like Fireball, Captain Freedom, and Buzzsaw. And the ending, while almost a let-down (the dialog exchange between Killian and Richards isn't their best moment exactly), still packs a punch and finishes with the cheesiest 80s song this side of Warrant or Winger.The presentation, ironically enough, works much better as a parody of itself, and if there's any significant achievement it's a true diversion machine. For all of the points made about how disturbing the control and brainwashing effect of TV has on the public masses, The Running Man is smartest at being its dumbest, if that makes sense. It's a movie I'll be sure to stay on when hanging with friends with nothing else to do, with many lines likely to become quotable as time goes on (the 'fist ramming into the stomach' line is a killer)",The Running Man
13,BandSAboutMovies,I wish this had aged better,5,22 October 2017,"The Running Man was a troubled production, with original director Andrew Davis (Under Siege, The Fugitive) being replaced a week into filming by former Starsky and Hutch actor, Paul Michael Glaser (he's gone back to acting, but not before giving us the magic that is Kazaam). In his book, Total Recall, Arnold wrote that this was a horrible decision, as the director ""shot the movie like it was a television show, losing all the deeper themes. In fairness, Glaser just didn't have time to research or think through what the movie had to say about where entertainment and government were heading and what it meant to get to the point where we actually kill people on screen. In TV they hire you and the next week you shoot and that's all he was able to do.""Written by Steven E. de Souza (who had a hell of a run, writing Commando, 48 Hrs. and the first two Die Hard films, while also adapting Mark Schultz's Xenozoic Tales for TV as Cadillacs and Dinosaurs) from the Richard Bachman book (Bachman was and is, of course, Stephen King, who was using a pseudonym to see if his success was due to talent or luck. A Washinton, D.C. book clerk named Steve Brown discovered the truth before an answer could be found. In fact, Bachman's next book was to be Misery, which ended up becoming a King novel. The Dark Half, which became a George Romero movie, is based on this experience.). In the original book, hero Ben Richards is anything like the physical description of Arnold, who is near super-heroic.The film starts that in 2017 — a time that we're all sadly too familiar with — the U.S. has become a police state post worldwide economic collapse — perhaps not as close to home, but uncomfortably nearby. Actually, it's way too close to reality, as the opening text tells us that the ""great freedoms of the United States are no longer, as the once great nation has sealed off its borders and become a militarized police state, censoring all film, art, literature, and communications.""Within two years, the only thing that keeps the populace under control is The Running Man, a game show where convicted felons battle for their lives against the Stalkers, who are presented as pro wrestling/American Gladiators style stars. Damon Killian (Richard Dawson of TV's Family Feud and Hogan's Heroes, as well as one of the first people in the U.S. to own a VCR) hosts the proceedings and remains one of the enduring reasons to enjoy this film. One gets the idea that Dawson was keen to parody his years of hosting game shows and he cuts through this film, making his role so much better than it deserves to be, whether it's his ads for Cadre Cola or the way he shits on everyone in his path, even lowly custodians. IMDb states that plenty of folks who worked with Dawson on Family Feud claim that he was exactly like this character, but that seems like the sour grapes of hearsay. Anyways, worried that ratings may slip, Killian pushes for Ben Richards, the ""Butcher of Bakersfield,"" (actually, it was all a setup and he was wrongly convicted of killing citizens during a food riot) to be the next runner.Read more at https://bandsaboutmovies.com/2017/08/15/the-running-man-1987/",The Running Man
14,Coventry,Mass Media Manipulation,6,29 November 2010,"I don't exactly remember who, but it was a brilliant philosopher who once said that the IQ of a group is inversely proportional to the size of the group. This is undeniably one of the most truthful observations ever made and it's particularly illustrated through stupid TV game shows and/or reality soaps in which an outrageous crowd is cheering and yelling stuff at contestants they don't even know. ""The Running Man"" cleverly picks in on this observation, together with the ancient and clichéd themes of fake sensationalism and media manipulation. The year's 2019 and ""The Running Man"" is the name of an extremely popular TV-show, hosted by the equally popular Damon Killian, in which convicted death row prisoners are offered a nearly inexistent chance to regain their freedom. In front of a live audience and broadcast on national television, the contestants are literally catapulted into a wasteland (housing blocks destroyed by a great earthquake) and hunted down by professional assassins with flamboyant gimmicks; known as the Stalkers. Ex-military man Ben Richards, convicted for a civilian massacre he didn't commit, is considered the ideal Running Man as he might actually survive more than one round. This film actually quite a lot in common with Lucio Fulci's obscure exploitation flick ""The New Gladiators"" from 1984, in which sleazy TV-producers recruit death row prisoners as futuristic gladiators and broadcast their battle to live and death live on television. Usually the Italians imitate high-grossing Hollywood films, but in this case it's vice versa. Steven E. Souza's screenplay is an adaptation of a novel written by Richard Bachman, which is actually a pseudonym of Stephen King. ""The Running Man"" is enjoyable and fast-paced Sci Fi/action with violent kills, grotesque futuristic imagery and lovely OTT acting performances. Arnie Schwarzenegger is a joy to behold and he has a totally ludicrous one-liner for each Stalker that he eliminates. Maria Conchita Alonso still stands as one of the hottest insignificant love-interests of the whole 80's decade and there are a few interesting supportive roles for Jim Brown (""Slaughter"", ""Black Gunn""), Yaphet Kotto (""Alien"", ""Across 110th Street"") and WWF star Jesse Ventura (""Predator"").",The Running Man

16,hitchcockthelegend,I'm not into politics. I'm into survival.,7,7 August 2016,"The Running Man is directed by Paul Michael Glaser and adapted from the Stephen King (as Richard Bachman) story by Steven E. de Souza. It stars Arnold Schwarzenegger, Maria Conchita Alonso, Richard Dawson, Yaphet Kotto, Jim Brown, Jesse Ventura, Erland van Lidth, Marvin J. McIntyre, Gus Rethwisch, Professor Toru Tanaka and Mick Fleetwood. Music is by Harold Faltermeyer and cinematography by Thomas Del Ruth.It may be packed with cheese and is as nutty as a squirrel's sandwich, but this is one astutely entertaining futuristic slice of sci-fi pie. Schwarzenegger becomes a reluctant contestant in the most popular TV show of the time, The Running Man. It's a sadistic show where convicts are thrust into a zonal world and have to avoid an array of stalking killers. Cue lots of outrageous violence, equally outrageous costumes, and of course with Arnold in the lead there's plenty of dialogue zingers. The caustic observation of how television programmes have evolved is potently portentous, and it's all played out to an industrial 80s score from Faltermeyer.It helps if you know what you are going to get from it, since it's a typical Schwarzenegger movie from the fruity chaotic popcorn era in the 80s. So with that in mind, for A.S. fans this is one to gorge on with glee - for others it may not have the charm offensive required to strike a chord. 7/10",The Running Man
17,Theo Robertson,The Future Is Now,7,9 June 2013,"2017 and America is held in the grip of fascism where a corporate TV company controls the entire media . After refusing to fire on unarmed civilians paramilitary policeman Ben Richards is sent to a labour camp . After leading a breakout he is recaptured and forced to take part in a violent reality show called The Running Man I was never a fan of big Arnie and I only had vague memories of THE RUNNING MAN . By chance I caught it and settled down to watch the film not expecting much . As you might expect it's got all the trademarks of an Arnie star vehicle such as smart one liners , violence , smart one liners , violence , a damsel in distress , smart one liners , violence and smart one liners . Strangely I found myself enjoying the movie far more than I would have possibly expected and this was down to he satirical aspects which hit home far more accurately than anyone could have envisaged The setting is 2017 four short years away from now and despite the fact this film was released 26 years ago it has an uncanny sense of prophecy . The world economy has collapsed and America is ruled by unfeeling corporate capitalism . In order to keep peoples minds off their repression the state broadcasts violent game shows with the most popular one being The Running Man with Damon Killian . Instantly I was reminded of Jerry Springer and of the reality TV shows at the turn of the century where everyone could literally be famous for 15 minutes . Bitter cynicism runs throughout the film along with biting satire such as a poster in the background advertising a television show called The Hate Boat which caused me to stifle a giggle . Hats off to director Paul Michael Glaser for predicting the future . Now if he could tell me the winning numbers to next weeks lottery I would be a very happy man As entertaining as THE RUNNING MAN is there's a slight problem and that is that it's a bit too interested in the action scenes along with the smart one liners . In its defence you wouldn't expect anything less in an Arnie film but one wonders what a director like Paul Verhoeven could have done with the material ? When Killian calls a commercial break we could have perhaps seen satirical adverts like we had in ROBOCOP . As it stands THE RUNNING MAN isn't really a classic but is an amusing take on the future that is closer to reality than what anybody could reasonably predict",The Running Man
18,Hey_Sweden,"""Get me the justice department, entertainment division.""",8,2 January 2017,"Arnold Schwarzenegger is at his ass-kicking, quipping best in this superior sci-fi action spectacular. It's the ""future"", and police officer Ben Richards (Arnold) is framed for a massacre of rioters. After busting out of prison, he's ultimately caught again, and is made to participate in the nations' most popular competition show, ""The Running Man"". Hosted by the extremely smarmy Damon Killian (Richard Dawson, incredibly well cast), it offers convicted criminals their own chance at freedom - IF they can evade the executioners who dress in colorful costumes and who are referred to as ""Stalkers"".""The Running Man"" offers a fair bit of food for thought. Now that we've actually reached the year in which this movie takes place, it makes us think about the world we live in, and where we're possibly headed. Much like ""Network"" 11 years before it, ""The Running Man"" became a prophetic movie, depicting the advent of so-called ""reality television"" in our society. And it also makes us think about how the media may be constantly manipulating information before we ever get to see it.Not that ""The Running Man"" is all substance and no style, of course. It's also a tried and true Arnold vehicle, in which he gets to strut his stuff and offer up a one-liner every time he overcomes an antagonist. ""Here is Sub Zero. Now, *Plain* Zero!"" The lighting, the sets, and the costumes are a delight to behold, in this portrayal of a Dystopian future where the unruly lower class are held in check by being delivered the lurid thrills of this ""game show"". Harold Faltermeyers' music is catchy, as it always is. There is some potent violence, although the squeamish should know that the gore doesn't really get all that hard for them to handle.Arnold is supported by a pretty eclectic mix of performers: Maria Conchita Alonso as his feisty leading lady, Yaphet Kotto and Marvin J. McIntyre as his prison associates, Jim Brown, Jesse Ventura, Erland Van Lidth (whose final film this was), Bernard Gus Rethwisch, and Professor Toru Tanaka as assorted ""Stalkers"", and musicians Mick Fleetwood and Dweezil Zappa. Familiar faces in small roles include Sven-Ole Thorsen, Edward Bunker, Kurt Fuller, Ken Lerner, Dey Young, Thomas Rosales Jr., and Lin Shaye. Although designed as an Arnold vehicle, it's Dawson that really makes ""The Running Man"" come to life.A very fun movie that, if anything, looks better today than it did when it first came out.(Loosely) based on a novel by Richard Bachman (a.k.a. Stephen King).""Killian, I'll be back!"" ""Only in a rerun.""Eight out of 10.",The Running Man
19,LeonLouisRicci,Virtually Unwatchable...Dated and Dumb,1,17 June 2013,"Extremely loud, gaudy, and dumb. This awful looking Movie has one redeeming quality. It takes a High-Concept, stalwart Story of Classic Science Fiction and strips it of all intelligence and delivers it to the lowest common denominator for consideration.Otherwise it is quite unwatchable. Irritating to the max it includes the worst one-liners in Action Movie History. Considering they are so bad it is inconceivable that there are so many. They parade them out every few minutes just when the Audience is finished cringing from the previous unfunny elementary exclamation. ""What a hot head, Hey Christmas Tree, He had to split, Want a light"" just aren't remotely funny.The sets, costumes, and Action pieces are also flat looking and superficial. As are the Exercise Video Dance Numbers and the bombastic Game Show stage. Everything on screen is as cheesy as it gets and nothing is at all exciting or engaging. This may be Arnold's worst Action Movie and is truly painful to watch. It literally hurts both the eyes and the ears and may cause permanent irreparable damage to your funny bone not to mention your IQ.",The Running Man

I would personally say that there's a strong case for the concept deserving a far more respectful treatment... after all, there was this, The Truman Show, others, as well, and people still went for reality shows. This is fairly dumbed down, and even the casual eye can catch glaring holes. I'm not against mindless entertainment, though I do feel that it can be done without completely sacrificing sense. Fortress and Judge Dredd are examples of B-movies that also present a dystopian future and feature bad-ass fights and shootouts, but that handle their moral and themes convincingly. Heck, the latter of the two was even written by Souza. Anyway, this ends up as a cheesy 80's action flick(and should certainly satisfy anyone looking for exactly that), with ridiculous one-liners and preposterous baddies for Arnie to go one-on-one with. The music is fitting. Provided you get into it, this is intense, and the pacing is fast without overwhelming. The performances all appear to be delivered by acting school dropouts. Sexuality is limited to mentions and eye-candy. Language is pervasive and as harsh as it gets. I recommend this to fans of those who made this, and/or all who want to watch motion pictures of this type. 7/10",The Running Man
22,view_and_review,Good 80's Version of Dystopia,7,13 June 2014,"The year is 1987 and The Running Man is on the silver screen and it is also the hottest dance. Any person born before 1981 or '82 should remember the Running Man. MC Hammer and Vanilla Ice probably popularized it more than anyone. It was easy to do and a smooth move... the movie was good too, and no, I don't think the dance move was named after the movie.The Running Man, the movie, is about a future dystopian America where people are poor, oppressed and part of a police state. Schwarzenegger plays Ben Richards, a Sargent in the military, who was imprisoned after he disobeyed a direct order to kill unarmed civilians. Running Man, within the movie, was a game show hosted by Damon Killian who is played by Richard Dawson, the ex-host of The Family Feud. Running Man pitted supposed criminals against ""stalkers"" as the criminals ran for their lives. Ben Richards was forced to partake in the Running Man game show and so began the fury.This was not on the level of Terminator, Predator or even True Lies, but this was still a good Schwarzenegger movie. The story was tight and even though most of the acting was poor Richard Dawson was great. Of course, if a teenager today were to watch The Running Man it would be like playing pong compared to Gears of War. The effects were good for the 80's although the music was God awful. How does an era that brought us Michael Jackson, Whitney Houston, Prince and more have such terrible music? This movie was rife with bad synthesizers for the musical score. The movie is good, but take out the music and the horrendous puns and the movie is very good.",The Running Man

But that's OK - the lighter touch suits Schwarzenegger, and it's an entertaining movie.But it's interesting to look back on this 1987 movie with 25 years' hindsight and notice how accurate it was about reality TV (albeit we haven't yet got as far as televised death chases).",The Running Man

It was produced by a minor-league company and it looks too cheap and claustrophobic for its ambitious futuristic setting. As a satire of people's addiction and desensitization to violence-as-entertainment, it's obvious and done to death (no pun intended). And as an action film....there is hardly any action in it, and when it does come, it's nothing to write home about. Many of Arnie's one-liners fall flat, and ""Dynamo"" must be one of the lamest ""villains"" ever conceived. On the other hand, there is an awesome head explosion, some funny moments (both intentional - ""Climbing For Dollars"", the foul-mouthed old lady, Jesse Ventura's part - and unintentional - Arnie's wooden acting in the opening helicopter sequence), a few decent effects, and a memorable scene with Maria Conchita Alonso in her negligee all tied up....she has some nice muscle tone in her arms! **1/2 out of 4.",The Running Man

Once out he promptly is recaptured and put on a television show called the Running Man. A show where one must make his way through a labyrinth being pursued by trackers that include a chainsaw wielding maniac to a hockey playing sumo. It makes for an entertaining ride though it differs greatly from the Richard Bachman novel from which it came from (aka Stephen King). In that story there was no game show arena, rather you just went to the outside world trying to elude the trackers as best you could and the longer you kept hidden from them the more money your family got. Here it is different and look who is in it. With Arnold you need larger than life villains to go against him and also of note is Richard Dawson who is actually rather good as the host of the demented show. Let's face it though, he isn't exactly differing drastically from what he used to do all the time. So what do you get here?

It probably had been done before, but I can't think of anything specifically. It certainly has been done afterward. The Japanese cult classic Battle Royale is pretty close to the same concept. The ideas in the film pretty much take a back seat to the nonstop action. And one-liners. This movie has some of the best (meaning most hilariously cheesy) one-liners in action movie history. Some of them are moderately amusing, like when, after he kills the guy with the chainsaw, Schwarzenegger says, ""He had to split."" But the one that had me rolling on account of its pure awfulness was after he dispatched of Sub-Zero: ""Now he's just plain zero."" You feel like there should be crickets chirping after that one. I also love how much the future looks like the '80s, especially the freshly permed dancers. And whosever idea it was to cast Richard Dawson as the villainous, scumbag gameshow host deserves a medal.

It's entertaining and a good view on how modern society is now, that is reality tv where people are being brainwashed by the media.

It's the action star killing bad guys and firing off quips like nobody's business. Its fairly ridiculous from the get, but it's even sillier when it descends into full-on chase movie. What entertains me are the various parts that make up the movie. The game show host is literally Richard Dawson (does it count as stunt casting if it's that unbelievably perfect?). They they throw in Mick Fleetwood and Dweezil Zappa (because, why not?), and Jim Brown and Jesse Ventura for background muscle. And it's directed by Starsky!

35,JamesHitchcock,Panem et Circenses,5,14 November 2005,"At the centre of ""The Running Man"" is an idea also found in other movies such as ""Rollerball"", namely that of an authoritarian government using violent entertainment as a means of distracting the attention of the populace away from its misdeeds. It is an idea that probably derives from memories of classics lessons at school and that quip from Juvenal's satires about Roman emperors providing their subjects with ""panem et circenses"" (bread and circuses), although it is not one that has been generally borne out by modern totalitarian regimes. The Soviet Union and its satellites preferred a mixture of state-sponsored high culture and propaganda to rollerball-type violence. Had the Nazi regime, by some evil mischance, survived into modern times, a typical evening for the German viewer would be speeches by Party leaders, a Wagner opera live from Bayreuth and a soap opera about the happy lives of an Aryan family under National Socialism, probably followed by a documentary inviting Germans to sneer at the cheap, tacky game shows dished up as entertainment in decadent democracies like America.By the year 2017, according to this film, America is no longer a democracy, but it is certainly decadent, and the game shows are cheaper and tackier than ever. The country has become a poverty-stricken dictatorship, reliant on violent and thuggish security forces to maintain order. Unable to provide its citizens with a regular supply of panem (food riots are commonplace), the government is forced to rely heavily on circenses. Each dictatorship has its own style of circus. Hitler had the Nuremberg rallies, Stalin had the May Day parades and America's future fascists have ""The Running Man"", a television game show complete with showbiz razzamatazz, scantily-dressed showgirls and an obnoxiously smug, self-satisfied host, Damon Killian. This is, however, a game show with a difference. The contestants are criminals who are forced to run for their lives pursued by a gallery of hired assassins. The winners are theoretically rewarded with their freedom, although in practice nobody ever wins. The main character is Ben Richards, a policeman framed for a crime he did not commit. After escaping from jail and being recaptured, he is sentenced to take part in the show along with two members of an underground resistance movement and Amber, a young woman who initially betrayed him to the security forces but who has herself aroused the suspicion of the authorities after staring to doubt Richards's guilt.The film was clearly made with satirical intent, aimed particularly at the way entertainment was developing in the late eighties. Its predictions about the way things might go in the future often seem uncomfortably close to home when seen from the vantage-point of 2005. The popular mid-nineties game show ""Gladiators"", for example, looks suspiciously like a version of ""The Running Man"" without the bloodshed, and the ""reality"" programmes which are unfortunately so much in vogue today pander to milder versions of the sadism and voyeurism which motivate the spectators seen in the film.The danger, however, of satirising this sort of entertainment is that one will become the thing one is attacking. There was doubtless an element of conscious hypocrisy here; the film is a satire on violent and exploitative entertainment, and also violent and exploitative entertainment itself. The spectators of the fictitious game show start out supporting the assassins, but as Richards turns the tables on his adversaries they begin to root for him, and the film's audience are encouraged to root for him too as he turns into a futuristic Rambo. High-minded satire will only take you so far in the cinema, and the film-makers evidently felt that there was more commercial mileage in combining a standard good-guy-against-bad-guys plot with a certain amount of low-minded satire.Another element in the film is sardonic humour reminiscent of the James Bond films. Whenever Richards dispatches one of his enemies he does so with a deadpan quip a la Roger Moore. (If you can imagine Roger Moore speaking with a heavy Germanic accent). I have never been Arnold Schwarzenegger's greatest admirer, but I have to admit that he can do deadpan well. Unfortunately, it is about the only thing he does well. Indeed, in this film it's about the only thing he does at all. Arnie's lack of emotional versatility , however, is not fatal. He certainly looks physically right as an action hero, and his ability to project a physical presence was clearly an important element in his success as an actor in this sort of film. (This is a more important element than is sometimes realised; I was never able to believe in Michael Keaton's Batman, for example, precisely because he lacked that ability). If the film is seen as a futuristic action thriller it is a reasonably good example of the genre. 5/10",The Running Man

37,MovieAddict2016,"He Said He'd Be Back...""The Running Man"" is Fun No Matter How You Slice and Dice it...",7,28 March 2003,"""The Running Man"" is based on a story by Richard Bachman, a.k.a. Stephen King writing under pseudonym. It takes place in the near future, where everything is run by the media and the government. Kind of like right now. In the future, there isn't much selection on television. All there is is ""The Running Man""--hosted by Damon Killian (Richard Dawson, host of ""Family Fortune"" in real life)--a show that features convicts, or ""runners"" being chased by madmen, or ""stalkers."" It's a bit like a futuristic gladiator sport. No one ever, ever wins the show. But Schwarzenegger has yet to play. Arnold Schwarzenegger plays Ben Richards, also known as The Butcher of Bakersfield, for firing upon a crowd of humans in a food strike. Only one problem. He's been framed--he never shot anyone. After Arnie escapes from jail, Damon Killian wants his hands on him for the show--so they hunt him down and bring him in. Damon offers Ben a deal--if he goes on the show, he'll let his friends from jail go free. But if he doesn't...he puts his friends on. So Richards agrees to play the game, only to find that Damon has put his friends-from-jail in the show anyway. Right before being launched in the arena, Ben Richards says to Damon, ""Hey, Damon. I'll be back."" There is a pause. ""Only in a rerun,"" Damon says. Yeah, right.This movie is about as action-packed and adrenaline-punched an action movie you're going to see in a while. We see an excuse for Schwarzenegger being thrown into an arena with killers, where he must use his brains, strategy, and most of all muscles, to kill the stalkers. But the thing is, the excuse for throwing Schwarzenegger in the arena is a good one. They didn't completely ignore the plot; they don't even throw him in the arena until at least a half hour into the film. They set up the plot first, which is nice.Arnold proves his acting talent is not just in his muscles once again. Too many people make fun of Schwarzenegger's acting skills, but to tell you the truth, I prefer him over Bruce Willis and Sylvester Stallone any day. Bruce and Sly are mumblers, in my opinion. Anyway, I like Arnold in this movie, because unlike in ""The Terminator"" where he is an indestructible cyborg, he is a vincible human with emotions in this film. We see a different side to Schwarzenegger, and it's pretty nice.Richard Dawson is surprisingly good as Damon. I love his charisma on screen. Of course he's good at playing a gameshow host--he himself was one--but he also has a very good acting talent. Check out the scene where he offers Arnold a deal for going on the show. Look how smug he is in that scene, and how well he delivers his lines. He envelops his character very well. An underrated actor if ever I saw one. He comes off slightly creepy and slightly likable.This movie is good fun no matter how you slice and dice it. I've often noticed it has a bit of a weird vibe to it, but then I realized that's just the sci-fi/futuristic vibe of the film. I've felt it before when watching sci-fi films. There's something about them. When I watch a film, or a certain genre, I get different vibes. Sci-fi gives me a weird vibe that is undescribable. This film gives that vibe to me. It sounds weird, but I think a lot of people get ""vibes"" and don't realize it.I recently viewed this movie twice in less than a day; once at night and once in the morning. It just goes to show how easy it is to watch. It is strictly a fun, action film with lots of imagination and charisma. Easy to watch with a high re-watch factor.What would you rather do with 90 minutes of your life on a Friday night then watch Arnold Schwarzenegger get to knock some skulls together in a gladiator arena? Exactly.4/5 stars -",The Running Man

39,KineticSeoul,Lost interest when the actual Running Man game started,5,22 March 2012,"I like the premise of a group of people in a area fighting others or each other to survive. Yeah, it has been done a lot even with cars. But this movie was made in 1987 so it could be one of the movies that might have started it all, not quite sure though. So there is Arnold Schwarzenegger in his prime doing what he does best in movies. There is just some obvious plot-holes in this that comes off just absurd, especially how in the movie a TV program can alter and change news to what they want. Just about nothing in this movie makes any sense sometimes. So basically there is this TV show in the year 2017 where convicts and some that are framed could have a choice or forced to participate in a game show. Where they don't kill each other but has to run and fight these killers that work on the show that has weapons. But the runners have no weapons and have to use there environment and sometimes the items the killers carry in order to survive. The thing is this movie starts out sort of interesting and entertaining which is about the first 30 minutes. And that is before the main Running Man show with Arnie starts, but when the game begins I started to find myself lose interest. It's just predictable and boring to watch and nothing really grabbed my attention. If the absurdity in this movie doesn't bother you as much, you just might enjoy this movie a bit more. The build up can lead some audiences to believe the Running Man is going to be really entertaining show, especially with the viewers in the movie going bonkers for the show in the movie. Overall there is nothing much that stands out about this movie even if it came out in 1987. After about a hour I was anxious for this movie to end so I can movie on to something else. Just didn't care for any of the characters and felt that nothing was really at stake. I give this movie a 5 since it has some hysterical Arnie moments.5/10",The Running Man
40,OllieSuave-007,Must-see reality TV!,7,3 July 2014,"This is another Arnold flick where he plays wrongly convicted man Ben Richards, who must try to survive a capital punishment game show where convicted felons are hunted down by trained stalkers. To survive this game and proclaim his innocence, Richards must fight off such things like men with chainsaws and sharpened hockey sticks, all in the view of a wild audience.Set in the future where the government controls everything, this movie has some sophisticated special effects and non-stop action that will give you edge-of-your-seat entertainment. The acting was OK for the most part, chock-full of Arnold's funny one-liners, and the overall story was unique (but makes you hope that today's real reality shows won't go that far!).Some downsides, though, was that I thought many of the action scenes were filmed in a very dark effect (could hardly see anything) and most of the characters and extras portrayed were cold-hearted wild people without a shred of humanity and regard for human life (I guess that what may happen if the government controls every thing and action). But, overall, it's an exciting Arnold film that will keep you entertained.Grade B-",The Running Man
41,sol1218,I'm into survival not politics,7,11 December 2009,"**SPOILERS** Futuristic film about a totalitarian government that had taken over the US and uses the media to keep the public in line and satisfied with blood lust-like shows. The most popular being the brutal ""Running Man"" hosted by its giggling psycho host Damon Killian, Richard Dawson.It's when Killian saw a news clip of former L.A cop Ben Richards, Arnold Schwartznegger, running from the police with his bulging muscles and perfect physique he saw his lagging ratings for his show-The Running Man-jump up at least 10 points. Richards had been framed for the notorious Bakersville Massacre where, during a food riot, some 60 civilians were gunned down by the L.A.P.D police helicopter that he commanded. With Richards now in custody he'll be the feature act in the next Running Man show where survive of the contestants, like Richards, is almost non-existent.Getting away from all the preliminaries leading up to the main event the film really gets started when Richards is given the chance to save his life by withstanding and defeating all the stalkers on the show who are out to finish him off. Right away Richards sees what a lying lowlife swine Killian is by him having his two friends Laughlin & Weiss, Yaphet Kotto & Marvin J. McIntire, who escaped along with him from a government gulag put in the same position that he's in: Fighting for their lives against impossible odds as contestants on the show. That was something that Killian promise Richards he wouldn't do if he agreed to participate and go on the show.With his new found girlfriend-whom he picked up along the way- Amber, Maria Alonso, Richards takes on the best and most effective stalkers that Killian could throw at him making mince meat fried chicken and Susi out of them. This doesn't save either Laughlin and Weiss who in the end are killed during the savage and brutal game.***SPOILERS*** Richards who was only interested in his own survival turned his interest to overthrowing the ruthless and Nazi-like government when he saw first hand what they've been doing to him and his fellow Americans in enslaving them in both body as well as mind. With a new outlook on life and the sorry state that America is in Richards after dispatching the stalker squad that was out to kill both him and Amber turned his attention on Killian, who with his gang of goons no longer around to protect him, and gave him a taste of his own medicine!P.S Even more effective then surviving the game of ""Running Man"" Richards with the help of his late friend Weiss, who was an electronic genius, was able the break the secret code that controls the broadcasts of the country's media-via satellite-outlets. By him doing that the American public were finally able to get the truth of how their Fascist Government lies to as well as manipulates them! And even more important they'll also be able, by rising up against it, to finally put a stop to it! One of those truths that comes to the surface is just how Richards himself was railroaded by the government in taking responsibility in the Bakersville Massacre. Which in fact as the original news video tapes showed, before they were altered, he tried to stop!",The Running Man
42,lost-in-limbo,Running for a purpose!,6,3 August 2006,"In the future, a helicopter pilot Ben Richards refuses to shoot down unarmed civilians who are protesting, so for his trouble he is framed for the massacre of these innocent victims and is locked up. After some time he and couple of buddies escape prison, only to wind up in a popular 24/7, government controlled TV show called the ""Running Man"", where the hapless convicts are pitted up against some gladiatorial figures known as stalkers. And if they get through alive, they earn their right for freedom.There's nothing quite like showbiz! ""The Running Man"" is what you can call a relic of the very cheesy and kitsch action films of the 80s and despite that, I thought its charming appeal still holds up very well today and it keeps running on, until empty. The screenplay is taken off Stephen King's novel, and is very loosely tied too it. One thing that shows up heavily is that of its High-Tec social commentary on the manipulative state of the TV culture. Perfect it ain't in portraying this, but it's attention to the media's fake propaganda and fixation it creates in stirring up violence has a certain style and truth about it more so now. While, there's a nice slice of satire. The comic-style action scenes don't disappoint with its arsenal of razzle-dazzle, thunderous and pulse pounding stunts that goes down well with its fun gladiator concept and Schwarzenegger's ability to fit right at home with the action side of things. Now when it came to the dialogue, don't be expecting to hear wise words coming out of their mouths. It gets purely risible treatment with many fashionable one-liners you associate with an Schwarzenegger flick (well, they do make the film more fun in the way he delivers them). He's on fire here, with pun overload! The ragged story which doesn't scrap too much off the top goes over-the-top with many holes and contrived possibilities. It does set up an interesting bunch of characters (definitely the stalkers), but it just doesn't go into any sort of detail and development to give the film more credit. The performances are glum, especially from the supporting cast. Richard Dawson gives a sneeringly, cheerful performance as the TV host Damon Killian. Arnold Schwarzenegger as Ben Richards knocks down fine performance that doesn't ask too much on the lyrical side. Maria Conchita Alonso who plays opposite of Schwarzenegger is reasonably stiff. The rest: Yaphet Kotto, Jesse Ventura, Jim Brown and Dweezil Zappa get up to very little in their parts. Surrounding the film is a free falling, noisy soundtrack that provides a funky boost. The production designs do look very cheap, but gladly enough it's a quick moving joint (maybe too so) where anything goes in this no-brain of a game.It's Showtime, alright! Enjoyably silly Sci-fi / action fluff, that's fun in a loose and campy sort of way.",The Running Man
43,Robert_duder,Bleak vision of an eighties action flick,7,12 September 2005,"***UPDATE--I just watched The Running Man again (September 10th/2013) and in reading my old review, I was a little surprised. This time around I enjoyed it a lot more. Yes it is cheesy and they do make some mistakes and I even think Schwarzenegger wasn't necessarily right for this part but it has an undeniable quirky style that has won me over. I guess that shows you how movie tastes change over the years. One thing remains is that Richard Dawson is stunning in this movie!! It is cheesy, simple fun that is really a fun guilty pleasure. I update my scoring from a deplorable 5 to a much more conducive and solid 7/10***I am a fan of several things that this movie tries to encompass. First of all it's based on a novella (which I admit I have never read) by Stephen King under his pseudonym. I love King films and even the bad ones are usually watchable. Second of all...eighties movies. The eighties defined theatre going experiences. The action films were big and bold and ""R"" rated and lots of violence and bad language and they are just classics. Lethal Weapon, Predator, Commando, Beverly Hills Cop, Terminator. Arnold KNEW action. He's no brilliant actor but he was always kick ass. On to this rather disappointing outing.The Running Man has a decent enough plot, the story or the plot isn't the issue. It's an intriguing concept but the way it was dealt with by director Paul Michael Glaser, yes Starsky. Glaser has done little more than Television to his directing career and I think that plays a part in the low budget, awful special effects and setting in The Running Man. Instead of creating a disturbing vision of the future the setting is campy, cheesy and looks like it's made out of cardboard. Andrew Davis who apparently was the original director was fired and that really is too bad because he went on to do some great action flicks. Arnold Schwarzenegger plays Ben Richards, a framed convict who is given one last chance of freedom by taking on a reality show where he is stalked by Gladiator type heroes who never lose. He does a decent enough job I mean he's Schwarzenegger, you either like him or you don't and he has a style for action flicks that he's always done period and this doesn't change but everything around him is so cheesy. They put him in a yellow spandex suit??? Maria Conchita Alonso plays his leading lady, and to her credit she has quite an acting career since this film but she is just useless to this film. She's not even eye candy, and her and Schwarzenegger are not good together. The Stalkers as they are known are okay but hardly used. Arnold makes short work of them. The real big highlight to this film is Mr. Richard Dawson. Now despite a few acting attempts prior to this film Mr. Dawson is more or less a game show host, best known for his hosting numerous times of Family Feud. He does such an incredible job as the evil villain and host of the reality show Damon Killian. I would go so far as to say it's one of the best performances in an action film I've ever seen. He's likable, and cheesy and evil all at once. He's the complete physical opposite of Schwarzenegger but they are the perfect adversaries.Despite a decent enough budget and a killer turnout at the box office this one kinda stinks but it's not the actors or the story, it's just the horrible way it was handled. I think this fell victim to being changed too many times and probably edited poorly. The film is also STUPIFIED with one liners...they stream out like verbal diarrhea and for the most part it's annoying but if you're ever studying catch phrases this film has MANY MANY MANY!!! If you're a huge Schwarzenegger fan or eighties fan or just want a cheesy action flick, I suppose it's worth renting but I'm done with it. It wasn't my thing...they ruined what could have been great. 5/10",The Running Man
44,Pjtaylor-96-138044,"Sorry, he doesn't do requests.",6,19 July 2019,"A dystopian retro-future, a deadly game-show, a garish yellow jumpsuit and just a few cheesy one-liners give 'The Running Man (1987)' a distinct spot in Schwarzenegger's library. While its story may have started life as a Steven King novel (written under a pseudonym), it's here transformed into a vehicle for its muscle-bound star to kill some bad-guys and yell at the host of the contest that he's caught up in. Perhaps unsurprisingly, the picture loses a lot of the subtext that its set-up - and, indeed, wider world - could have yielded, focusing more on its brash action and silly costumes. However, just enough of its underlying premise shines through to create an interesting, almost satirical and never-more-relevant setting for its decent set-pieces, on-the-nose comebacks and otherwise enjoyable high-concept carnage. The flick is generally entertaining but does start to lose a little steam in its mid-section, culminating in a finale that isn't as exciting as you might expect. It also features a strange romance that's rushed and just a tad predatory, too. Still, there are some undeniably fun sequences, including most of the stuff surrounding the aforementioned game-show, and the 'television take-down' angle is engaging, if a little extreme. Overall, this is a fun film with that's a little goofy in places and a little too serious in others. It's not a bad effort from Arnie, but it's not one of his best. 6/10",The Running Man
45,bowmanblue,They don't make 'em like they used to,10,31 December 2014,"The Running Man is a classic - classic Arnie, classic action and classic everything.It's about Ben Richards, a cop in a dystopian future who's framed for a crime he didn't commit (aren't they all?) and forced to 'star' on a futuristic game show called 'The Running Man' where prisoners are hunted down and killed in front of a live studio audience.It's a simple plot and copied quite a few times (the latest being The Hunger Games, which follows the same format), but it works perfectly. Arnie is on top form - if you like his particular brand of acting, i.e. he beats the hell out of, or kills, anyone who stands in his way then follows it up with a glib (and pretty cheesy) wise-crack.I looked The Running Man up online after I'd watched it and, it's fair to say, that people like to make fun of the million or so plot holes in the film. Yet, even though people like to point them out, very few actually find they detract from the overall enjoyment of the movie.In short, it's great. Stupid yes, but great. Put you mind on hold and watch what Arnie does best (which isn't politics) and dream of the day when TV has reached this stage, i.e. where X-Factor judges are hunted down with chainsaws for the enjoyment of us at home.",The Running Man
46,ThomasDrufke,Well That Hit The Spot!,7,27 January 2019,"The first thing I noticed while watching The Running Man and the first thing I wrote down in my notebook was ""this is unbelievably retro"", which is funny because it's supposed to take place in the year we're in, 2019. It's also a fascinating concept that is ripe for a remake if handled right tonally. Most of Arnold's films are cheesy, but rarely do they display the kind of cheese that we get after every one of Arnolds kills. Everything from ""That hit the spot"" to ""He had to split"" is used to describe people dying in a bullseye and splitting someone in half. You get the message after the first one that this isn't exactly a serious movie. So if you take it like that, there's a whole lot to be enjoyed here. And aside from that ridiculous underground rebel group, it's pretty clever too. Oh, and it's also incredibly influential once you realize just how many movies used the same sort of post-apocalyptic ideas.7.8/10",The Running Man

49,CuriosityKilledShawn,The future IS the 80's,7,6 May 2004,"Of all Arnold's mid-'80s movies who would have thought that most relevant today would be The Running Man. A chilling and surprisingly realistic tale of reality TV gone mad. It may have been far-fetched back then but not so now. Not when you think about it. Currently, Reality TV shows are either scraping the bottom of the barrel or desperate to raise the bar. If the next one isn't more controversial as the last, it's a dud. How long will it be before we really do see shows like The Running Man? How long before we have 'court-appointed theatrical attorneys' or the entertainment division of the Justice Department? There is so much satire and intelligence in this movie that may have been missed back in 1987 that is desperate to be seen again considering the current state of TV shows.The biggest message of all is 'You are being lied to'. It's no secret that the Government and the media work in cahoots. And the masses believe what the media tells them to believe. It's a very scary state of affairs and unless more accurate representations of the truth emerge we may easily accept a brutal show like the Running Man in the near future. It's no secret that Reality TV is not very realistic. It's edited and reshaped before being aired and it's only what the networks want you to see. Usually it's far from the real truth.Although rather different than Stephen King's book (the ending is completely changed) the script does conform to the typical Arnie formula. Yes, he does have numerous and very corny one-liners and he does say 'I'll be back' (which he never REALLY said that often anyway, when you think about it) in the most ironic situation yet but he's still a zillion times better in the role then Christopher Reeve or Dolph Lundgren would have been (these two were considered BEFORE Arnie believe it or not).The director is none other than Dave Starsky himself (Paul Michael Glaser). It may not be artistic but it is still strong enough to generate excitement and his use of neon and flourescent colors gives each individual set a pretty cool look. Andrew Davis (not a director I particularly like) was attached before Glaser, though no matter who directs, the film is still marred by a very heavy 80's feel.First of all, Harold Faltermeyer's score (remember him?) is incredibly dated and robs the action scenes of any timeless integrity. And the fashion sense of the movie is far too excessive to be convincingly set in the future. Apart from the dated feel, the only other thing that bugs me is the poorly staged shoot-out that passes as the climax.This new DVD is a zillion times better than the original release. Gone is the horrid letterbox picture. In its place is a brand new hi-definition 1.85:1 anamorphic transfer. The colors sparkle and literally pop from the screen. The new Dolby 5.1 EX and DTS ES soundtrack are also amazing. There constant use of the surround channels to great effect and the bass is strong and powerful. Definitely one of the best re-masters I've seen so far. Two intriguing documentaries, a trailer and a 'Meet the Stalkers' gimmick are included in this 2-disc set that comes in a rather neat slip case.",The Running Man

52,The-Sarkologist,Classic Arnie,8,1 March 2013,"This is one of the early Schwarzenegger movies, namely when he was not doing silly comedies. This is the movie in which Arnie seems to deliver all of his one liners (though they are not really all that good) and his back chat, and if you like one liners then this is where they all are. It seems to fall into the style of the typical early Arnie movie: it is hard science-fiction with a lot of action. It is similar to Predator, Total Recal, and the Terminator movies in that respect. It seems to follow a formula but it comes out quite well. I enjoy this movie. It is also based on a Stephen King book of the same name, though he uses his alias Richard Bachman.The year is 2017 and the US economy has collapsed to a point where food riots are common. The state takes control of network television and have censored a lot of other material. The most popular game at the time is the Running Man, a blood sport where stalkers hunt down helpless felons who attempt to gain freedom. The felons have absolutely no chance of escaping and the audience really only watches it to see the stalkers play with their prey. Ben Richards (Arnold Schwarzenegger) is monitoring a food riot and is ordered to shoot unarmed civilians; when he refuses he is framed for mass murder and locked away. Later he escapes only to be captured and put on the Running Man for ratings.The enemy in this movie is network television. Damon Killian (Richard Dawson) is the host of the show and is constantly showing a false image. In a way this movie seems to have a go at television propaganda, though it could be propaganda in itself by attempting to show us that what we have is not as bad as this. Killian is a sleazy character though for he lures people to him through his fame and his sweet talk. At the beginning of the movie he is able to talk his way out of anything, and able to come back at Arnie's promise that he will be back with a witty comment. When all is lost, so are his witty comments (though his death is very Hollywood).This movie isn't a shock movie as such, but more a cry for freedom. We have the typical rebel movement fighting for freedom and their desire to give the world their speeches. This never comes for it is not the speech, but rather the exposition of the lies. There is no freedom speech, and there is no overthrow of the government. Killian is simply revealed for what he really is and the most popular game show comes crashing down. Most will leave the movie thinking that the people have changed the world, but they have not. Governments don't fall that easily, and there is still the economic problem.",The Running Man

His tongue is planted firmly in his cheek, he is charismatic and it is certainly a fun watch that I enjoy. Especially with his one liners and watching him say ""I'm not in to politics""Following the success of Predator, Arnie landed himself a nice pay rise, with his next movie he took home $5,000,000. His pay had risen $4,000,000 in four movies. So he was doing something right. However fun it is, you can't escape what a missed opportunity this is. This should have been a blockbuster. However it's cheaply made, and a little bit too light and campy. In his autobiography Total Recall, Arnie talks about how when he left the set after one week of shooting for a few days, and when he came back the original director was fired by the producers, over budget concerns ($25 mill budget, $5 mill of it went straight to Arnie) and replaced with Paul Michael Glaser (of Starsky & Hutch fame) who had never directed a movie before, but was cheap and available. Arnie was furious at this, called it a ""terrible decision"" and he felt the movie was ""screwed up"" Finishing the year the 30th highest grossing movie of 1987, With a $38 million gross at the domestic Box Office, The Running Man did the same box office that most Arnie movies were doing at the time $20-$40 million range, when it certainly had the potential to be bigger.",The Running Man

55,tomgillespie2002,"Undeniably entertaining, with some genuine nice moments",4,15 November 2012,"A quasi-disturbing trend in '80's American cinema was the wisecrack; innocuous in some genres, it even extended to the horror film, with the child killer (paedophile if you want a 21st century tag) Freddy Krueger - who would flaunt his quips after extravagantly offing a ""youngun"". Within the action film, it was Schwarzenegger who was the king of the one-liners. The Running Man offered the perfect vehicle for this fashion of dialogue, with its structure of death-for-survival. In the future (2017 to be precise) the worlds economy has crashed leaving many homeless, and the state runs the entertainment industry - in this science fiction world, television ratings are raised by the depiction of violence and humiliation; as long as it is justified with criminality.Ben Richards (Schwarzenegger) is an ex-cop, wrongfully imprisoned for a helicopter attack on civilians. In the opening scene we see the ""real"" event, as Richards refuses to shoot innocents, and ignores orders. As we are in familiar sci-fi themes, this dystopic police state, and its control of the media, manipulates the facts to create a criminal. Escaping a maximum security prison (which seems surprisingly easy to break out of), Richards heads for his brothers in the city, whilst Laughlin (Yaphet Kotto) and Weiss (Marvin J. McIntyre) head for revolutionary activity. But the butcher of Bakersfield (the name attributed to Richards by the falsified media story) is too buff, and far too athletic to not be used in television most popular gameshow (its title used for this film), and Killian (Richard Dawson) spots the potential of this ""contestant"" in a prison break video.Captured and forced to take part in The Running Man, Richards (along with Laughlin and Weiss and the ubiquitous damsel (Maria Conchita Alonso) who is picked up along the way) has to face a series of stalkers, who hunt them down in a fight to the death. Simply put, it is a kind of underground gladiatorial entertainment, and with the over the top stalkers (including Fireball (Jim Brown) and Buzzsaw (Gus Rethwisch), who all have specific modes of weaponry) they face a game- like structure to get to the next level. In this structure we find the linguistic genius (sic) of Schwarzenegger, as he sardonically ""explains"" within one comedic line, what happened when he killed another man (for example, after raising buzzsaw's chainsaw to his groin, he is asked what happened to him, and Richards replies ""He had to split"" - hilarity!Some of the films themes resonate within our popular culture to this day. Now, I'm in no way stating that this film was prescient, or even that it was ahead of its time. The presentation is certainly of its time, and many of the ideas can be found elsewhere (within literature, Orwell's 1984 is standard for dystopian futures), such as Peter Watkins' Punishment Park (1971). What the film does highlight when viewed in another century is that the general populous has become far more media savvy that ever. We are used to the idea that anything we watch on television (particularly when we consider the mass of reality TV that litters our airwaves) we are watching something edited for the purpose of entertainment. In The Running Man, the audiences are unaware that manipulation is rampant within both current affairs and entertainment broadcasting.I think I may have just taken a Schwarzenegger film far too seriously. This is an '80's gung-ho action film, that perpetuates the throw-away, comic book violence that prevailed - after all, America was defeated in their last war (Vietnam) and, I'm guessing, had to make war and violence accessible to children! This frightening concept would become more concerning when many adult action ideas were transferred to Saturday morning cartoons (both Robocop and Rambo were translated to cartoon, and they were based on two of the most violent films of the decade). This digression is not too far away from The Running Man, as it does often feel like it is directed at a younger audience, despite the bloody violence, it is very much a cartoonish and immature approach to what could have been a more cerebral comment on mass entertainment.Based on a book by Stephen King (Writing as Richard Bachmann), the film does have some interesting elements to it. In our modern world of multi- channel, on-demand entertainment, a large segment (the majority in fact) of the media we consume, is so insipid, so incredibly dumbed-down, that it would be easy to argue that these forms of visual pleasure are produced as a form of control (you know, keep them in line by feeding them s**t that rots the brain). In The Running Man, the largely homeless population gather round the over sized screens that litter the skyline to watch state-controlled gameshows, and they find their entertainment in the death of others. When Richards begins to beat the stalkers, the audience start gunning for the supposed ""villain"". Therefore, the film seems to be making the point that death is what people want to see, even if it is the wrong type of death.Despite all of these transgressions, this was one of the favourites as a youngster. It is undeniably entertaining, and has some genuinely nice moments, and offers some interesting visions of a future that was inevitably there in 1987, but in which has been exacerbated over the last 30 years of increasingly dumb entertainment. Within standard television production modes, The Running Man is not inspiring film making (it was directed by Paul Michael Glaser, who was Starsky in Starsky and Hutch, and also directed many episodes of Miami Vice). There is probably no doubt that this will be remade, as the ideas and themes are still very relevant today, but lets hope that if it is remade, they forget about the muscles and gladiator iconography, and focus on the manipulation through entertainment. And please, never, ever put Schwarzenegger in a Lycra jumpsuit!www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com",The Running Man

The Running Man is one of Arnold`s best and most different films even to this day and when I first saw The Running Man I was so excited to see a movie like this. I just adore all of the fights and this is truly a special movie. It also has Jesse Ventura, the legendary Professor Toru Tanaka, Sven-Ole Thorsen, the beautiful Maria Conchita Alonso, Yaphet Kotto, Kurt Fuller, Richard Dawson, and Thomas Rosales Jr. who seems to always like death in his movies because he has been killed in such films as Universal Solder, The Lost World, Robo Cop 2, Predator 2, and among others.

61,southdavid,Jeopardy,7,28 May 2020,"I don't ordinarily have a lot of love for the lower tier 80's action movies, so I'm not sure exactly what inspired me to choose ""The Running Man"" for an evening's entertainment. I'd listened to a podcast about Stephen King adaptations recently, so maybe that had something to do with it, but choose it I did... and despite the fact that some aspects have not aged particularly well, I thought that overall it was pretty solid.Set in the distant and unimaginable future of 2017, Ben Richards (Arnold Schwarzenegger) is a policeman who refuses to fire on a group of unarmed protestors. He is arrested, and framed for the attack anyway. Two years later, his escape from his workcamp brings him to the attention of Damon Killian (Richard Dawson), presenter and producer of The Running Man, a brutal gameshow where contestants are hunted by flamboyant killers. Upon his recapture, Killian makes Richards an offer, safety for his friends, if he willing participates in the show.The film is very 80's despite its future setting. It didn't imagine (or didn't have the budget to imagine) much in the way of cars, clothes or technology of the future, so everything is slightly exaggerated aspects of that time, or just the same. The acting is pretty bad, even for Schwarzenegger, but nobody else in the film covers themselves in any glory. This is the height of his ""kill a guy, witty putdown"" phase which I know was a thing, but in the context of this film doesn't make much sense, particularly on the occasions he just says them to himself. It keeps visual effects to a minimum, perhaps again because of budgetary constraints, but what it does do practically stands up.All that said, I felt it was a reasonably fun and enjoyable film. Though nothing like the book, I always understood what was happening and what Richards' next objective was. I felt it could have done with getting him into the game quicker, and also with more set pieces inside it. The hunters could have done with more unique settings, such as what Subzero had. But it breezed along at a reasonably pace and I was never less than entertained by it.",The Running Man
62,Vartiainen,Pro-wrestling will get hardcore in the future,5,30 November 2014,"Essentially what would happen if you gave the modern day pro-wrestlers lethal weapons and mixed it up with an Orwellian dystopia. A movie devoid of much plot, rhyme or reason, but which manages to entertain because of its 80s cheese and because Arnold ""The Behemoth"" Schwarzenegger is such a man.Though, to be fair, this isn't Arnold's best movie by any means. The script doesn't give him much to work with, either physically or emotionally. The movie does contain some of his best one-liners ever, but even those are more groan-worthy than fun because the rest of the film is so mindless. Sure, it's fun to watch in the ""what in the name of deities is happening!?"" kind of way, but the fact still remains that the bleak brutality of the early scenes doesn't match the goofy splatter tone of the actual The Running Man TV spectacle.But, the actual pro-wrestlers... I mean Stalkers, are a lot of fun to watch because they're so over the top, Arnold does have some really good lines and scenes, the action is suitably entertaining and as a whole the movie doesn't overstay its welcome. If you're a fan of 80s action films and you've yet to see this particular Arnold movie, then give it a watch. It's worth it.",The Running Man

64,subxerogravity,An 80's movie that actually stands the test of time!. Still Brilliant,7,2 November 2015,"Recently re saw this picture and discovered it's more contemporary now than it was when it was made. One Arnold's most underrated films of his heyday. I thought it was really good and stands the test of time.Out of all Arnold's movies it's the cheesiest. From the Arnold perspective, it tries to be Commando, hitting you with a bombardment of one liners and hoping that they stick, but they don't.The movie is far less spectacular form something would expect from the Oak in the 80s. It's very cheap and low budget.The coolest part despite the cheese was seeing Arnold rip through all his enemies as violent as possible. His enemies include Jim Brown, who you could consider the 1970s version of Arnold. Overall, watching this movie in this day and age makes me think that the film was ahead of its time. Reality Television today is only a ratings point away from doing the Running man. It's a nice little hidden gem",The Running Man
65,hellraiser7,Playing for Keeps,10,28 February 2020,"This is one of my favorite films of all time and this is also my favorite sci-fi and action films, Steven King film if you can believe that and second favorite Schwarzenegger film. This is also sort of an adolescent gem, at that time my mom let me rent out R rated films as I was old enough and this film was the first pick and it was a good one.I really like the plotline which I feel by today's standards is plausible and even prolific in many ways. With the reality television programs even some of the homemade online programs made almost every day who's to say they wouldn't go this far. Or even a governmental power wouldn't hesitate to employ the same tactics as the roman empire once did with the games. We get a good glimpse at this dystopian society where governmental powers have completely flushed morality and ethics down the toilet.We see not just authority and power abuse but most of all sensationalism and media/information manipulation completely out of control. Indeed, sensationalism and media have became completely dominant over this society as we see huge flat screens everywhere you go, there is not one spot without one. This is sort of prolific on the amount of technology we see people have in their hands, used, and taken everywhere and practically film and stream on the web or cloud, there almost isn't one person I see without it.Really like the wicked satirical sensibility in the film, where it's both serious but at the same times has a slight sense of humor. One scene that I always found humorous was a little scene on one of the other games shows they have in the future called ""Climbing for Dollars"" which you could say prolific on the TV show ""Fear Factor"".But also, I like that the film isn't just in the Dystopia sub-genre of Sci-Fi but mixes in the Future Sport sub-genre which I don't see often and these two make a beautiful mix. This film is pretty much ""The Most Dangerous Game"" but set in the future, really love how it's dressed up yeah, it's a dangerous sport as people die but looks cool and fun all the same.The music is great, there are plenty of fun and cool memorable tracks. Two of my favorites are the track of the battle against Sub Zero which I thought was cool as it just sung fast and suspenseful action. Another is the end credit song which I thought fit right as it was a sweet song that really brought relief after everything that happened.Even like the characters whom all have personalities and serve their functions well. From the main villain Killian played well by Richard Dawson which is an ironic role as he was formerly a game show host for ""Family Feud"", here it's sort of the alternative evil version you love to hate. This guy is a sadistic sensationalist that will do whatever it takes even flush the book of ethics and morality down the toilet to get big ratings and everlasting popularity.And of course, Ben Richards played well by Arnold. Ben is a sympathetic protagonist because he's just a regular guy that never asked be in the game or in any of the circumstances he's put though, basically goes with the old saying ""out of the frying pan, into the fire."" I even like that we see he's a bit of a reluctant hero, which to me makes him human as we see there is a resistance group that he see's has a noble cause but he doesn't want to be a part of it because he just wants to have and live a normal life. But fate of course intervenes time and again and he does what right, despite being pushed into doing it.I also like despite the muscle he's not all powerful, here he more human. We do see him kick as however here we actually see him use some of his wits a bit more which I though was a good change of pace but also makes the action a bit realistic, it makes sense with the advantage the stalkers have Ben's wit's really are his best weapon against them. But of course he's got plenty of memorable lines which contribute to the humor but also keep things interesting.The action in the film is great, in a way it sort of plays out like a live action video game sort of like the ""Street Fighter"" franchise. Like in that video game you have the audience pick out the Stalkers much like how we pick out fighters in the roster and each of the Stalkers have different abilities and skill sets and each of the battles take place in different arenas. Really like each of the Stalkers have costumes which make them look like live action fighting game characters.The one on one battles are great, their also suspenseful as you are wondering how the heck Ben is going to beat each of them. From the battle with Buzzsaw which was cool, and I could help but be on the edge of my seat in that battle hoping Ben doesn't get skewered from the chainsaw as it's a weapon that does nasty damage.Though my favorite battle is the one with Sub Zero which is cool as it takes place in a condensed hockey arena. It's suspenseful as Sub Zero clearly has as they would say in sports homecourt advantage as he is just employing hit and run attacks at them. Trying to swipe at them with a goalie hockey stick which acts as a sickle and hitting slap shots with explosive pucks. Your just constantly hoping Richards finds a way to get homecourt advantage.Overall, the Running Man has plenty of endurance for thrills and fun.Rating: 4 stars",The Running Man
66,Captain_Couth,"Bad, extremely loose adaptation of the Stephen King novel.",7,25 November 2003,"The Running Man (1987) is a terrible adaptation of the great Stephen King novel. Ironically most of the movie is based upon the French film Prize of Peril (which was based upon a novel written in the 60's that was an obvious influence on the novel this movie is based upon). Several scenes from the Prize of Peril are basically re-enacted for this film. But let's get back to the movie The Running Man. Arnold S. plays an unwilling participate in this variation on ""The Most Dangerous Game"" theme. Filled with bad acting and dialog (mostly from Arnold) and several implausible and phony set pieces, it's just an average film. Unlike most of his earlier starring vehicles that made around Arnold, this one tries to hard. I enjoyed this movie when I was 13 years old but not anymore.

67,jadavix,Unsatisfying actioner with satirical aspirations,6,10 January 2021,"""The Running Man"" is a strange movie. It seems it was intended as a satire of game shows, corporatism, and perhaps the media of the day. The presence of The Governator obviously also means the movie is an action flick, but there's no reason why it can't be both at once.But here's where the strangeness comes in: the movie is top-heavy with bizarre, larger than life figures who are both physically enormous and cartoonishly unique. There's The Body himself, and other governor in the movie, Jesse Ventura. There's Erland van Lidth, who as well as being physically massive and terrifying, was also a trained opera singer, and the movie lets him show off this skill. There's Jim Brown, the greatest NFL player in history. There's Richard Dawson, host of Family Feud, here playing a villainous, futuristic version of himself.But it doesn't stop there. There's also Mick Fleetwood, of Fleetwood Mac fame. Dweezil Zappa, son of Frank, with only two lines. And I can't forget Yaphet Kotto, the only actor who seems miscast, as his reserved, dignified acting style does not fit the movie's titular gameshow, which is like a WWE show in which regular people have to survive attempts on their lives by the wrestlers.Maria Conchita Alonso isn't so strange, as '80s/'90s action flicks often featured over-talented actresses as the female lead.What I make of this strange casting is that there were things going on in this movie, perhaps at script or pre-production level, that were not really brought out in the finished product. What we are left with is a movie which is half-baked action and half-baked satire. The parts with Dawson hosting the game show feel totally authentic and remind me of the media satire in ""Robocop"". Taking something so familiar and thrusting it into a terrifying future world is an effectively unnerving strategy.The parts in which Arnie goes one-on-one with the bizarre cadre of heavies are less well done. Of particular note is how unconvincing this future world looks, especially by contrast to the game-show. The movie never convinces you that this is a real time and place. Whenever they go outside, it looks like they're wandering through a parking garage.""Blade Runner"" came out five years before this, and IMDB estimates it had a similar budget.

The characterizations are very good, starting with Arnold. This was before he became a walking cliché, but still could poke fun at his screen persona.

Maria Conchita, Yapphet Kotto, all of the minor supporting characters are well drawn.Unlike Stephen King's novel, where the stalkers looked just like ordinary people who could attack you at any time, the stalkers in this version are hyped up 'superhero' motif characters, most of whom are killed off with wittily ironic punchlines.",The Running Man

That he's backed by two of the genre's most notorious overactors in Jesse Ventura and Jim Brown just amplifies the insanity, while a carefree, pun-loaded screenplay is only too happy to take advantage.

The funny thing is, Arnold isn't even the best thing about The Running Man. That distinction belongs to Richard Dawson, not exactly playing against type as a verbose and charming gameshow host, who steals the movie right from under the hero.

72,barnabyrudge,"Potentially thought-provoking futuristic thriller. Ultimately opts for the cheesy action approach, but is not wholly without merit.",5,30 January 2007,"When The Running Man first appeared in 1987, I thought it was rather far-fetched. So did many of the people who saw it on release. However, time has made this film less and less implausible. Nowadays, we watch celebrities enduring adventures in the jungle; we see people living in a house for months on end while we observe their every move; we see increasingly elaborate gameshows in which people jump from aeroplanes or eat bugs or perform stunts for the chance to win a little money. From the comfort of our armchairs we dare to call these shows ""reality TV"", and slowly but surely the television preferences of modern society draw ever nearer to those depicted in The Running Man. So, while the film may be cheesy and violent and jammed with questionable wisecracks, it does at least have a prophetic quality about it.In 2017, Ben Richards (Arnold Schwarzenegger), a military chopper pilot, is ordered to fire on innocent civilians to disperse a rioting crowd in the town of Bakersfield. Richards refuses to carry out the orders and is forcibly relieved of his command. while he is incapacitated, another of his men opens fire on the crowd and kills many of them. Later, Richards is framed for their deaths and falsely branded ""The Butcher Of Bakersfield"". He is placed in a high security prison in Los Angeles, but one day makes a daring escape with a couple of other convicts, Laughlin (Yaphet Kotto) and Weiss (Marvin J. MacIntyre). It isn't long before the trio are recaptured, but instead of being executed or returned to prison they are subjected to an even worse fate. They become unwilling contestants on a futuristic gameshow called The Running Man, in which convicts are sent into an abandoned and treacherous district of the city and pursued among the ruins by some heavily-armed ""Stalkers"". The gameshow is so popular that it is a regular TV ratings-topper, adored by the public who gamble on its outcome whilst glued to their screens. The man who fronts the show is slimy TV presenter Damon Killian (Richard Dawson), but he is so obsessed with maintaining the record-breaking ratings of his show that he isn't above hoodwinking the public by censoring the truth. Richards turns the tables on Killian and his corrupt TV network by outwitting the many adversaries they send in to kill him. And as the stakes get higher, Richards senses a chance to fight back and possibly even clear his name The central premise of the film is actually pretty good, as you would expect from a story inspired by the pen of Stephen King (assuming his pen-name of Richard Bachmann). But the potential for a film of considerable philosophical merit and thought-provoking ideas is largely neglected, with director Paul Michael Glaser opting for the cheesy action approach. Schwarzenegger disposes of each ""Stalker"" with an amusing quip, barely breaking into a sweat as he leads them on a merry dance through the ruins and rubble. Some of his wisecracks are funny, others are downright embarrassing. As an action hero, his physique is truly intimidating but his acting during the moments that require greater subtlety is wooden to say the least. Dawson, on the other hand, does a fine job as the gameshow host Killian, bringing believable callousness to the role. The sets are OK and the frequent action set pieces are handled with suitable adequacy. The Running Man is definitely one for the Friday-night-beer-and-pizza brigade, but somewhere just beneath the surface it actually hints at more than it ultimately delivers.",The Running Man

74,dwpollar,Really bad escapist trash of a movie...,2,7 September 2009,"1st watched 8/29/2009 - 2 out of 10 (Dir-Paul Michael Glaser): Really bad escapist trash of a movie with Arnold Schwarzenegger making bad jokes to try and lighten things up but it doesn't work. The movie is based on a novel that had to be more complex than this movie. The movie ramshots over information about the setting of the picture just to get to the action of Schwarzenegger's character competing in the popular futuristic game show of the day called ""The Running Man."" This gameshow allows convicts the chance to try and escape from what they call stalkers and will give them they freedom if they do so. Schwarzenegger's character is wrongly accused so, of course, we're routing for him. Richard Dawson, plays the host of the show, and actually does a good job in the off-color role but the rest of the movie is just plan bad. This piece of bad entertainment was directed by a former TV star from the Starsky & Hutch show and he shows here that he doesn't have this talent even though other TV stars have successfully changed into this role(aka. Rob Reiner, Ron Howard, etc...). Hopefully a lot of money wasn't spent on this worthless movie, and don't spend a lot to see it if you can help it.",The Running Man
75,slokes,Cheesy Guilty Pleasure,6,25 November 2006,"This is one of those rare movies that entertains you even as you see the seams in the production, in part because of a cheerful gonzo spirit at its heart; perhaps because it says about as much about when it was made as any film of its time.One of the goofiest muscle-action pics of the 1980s, ""The Running Man"" puts Arnold Schwarzenegger in a future where feathered hair and Armani jackets co-exist with deadly game shows and a totalitarian regime that sends helicopters to gun down a helpless hungry mob. When Capt. Ben Richards (Arnold) refuses such a command, he finds himself a contestant on the deadliest of these games, which forces convicts to literally run for their lives.Developed by screenwriter Steven de Sousa from a Stephen King novel (written under a pseudonym), ""The Running Man"" finds a nice balance between over-the-top parody and action thriller. The fight scenes are weak, the supporting actors (including Yaphet Kotto and Maria Conchita Alonso) largely lost, and the conclusion lame and obviously rushed in production, but you forgive a lot with Arnold, here tossing off some of his worst quips with obvious relish and finding in Richard Dawson a screen adversary every bit his equal in keeping our attention.Dawson plays Damon Killian, the falsely avuncular, deadly host of ""The Running Man"" game show, concerned in the beginning of the film about his show's sagging audience share and seeing in Richards a sure boost: ""They want ratings, I can get ten points for his biceps alone."" Dawson makes the most of his opportunity to show he had more to offer than kissing old ladies on ""Family Feud.""Everything's showbiz in this dystopian future, even when it comes to prisoner's rights (Arnold is visited by his ""court-appointed theatrical agent."") The tone here manages to be both breezy and bitter, like when we catch a glimpse of another game show where a guy climbs for money on a rope suspended above a pack of killer dogs. Placards in the background advertise shows like ""Confess"" and ""Pain American Style."" Whenever Richards is set upon by another of the game show's ruthless wandering killers, the studio audience screams with joy. It's so bilious a setting, it's hard to accept the premise that all these people need is to hear the truth and they'll come to their senses. They seem too far gone.The wandering killers, or ""stalkers,"" are the film's other plus, adding to its goofy charm. One can be best described as a samurai hockey player, another sings opera while shooting electricity from his hands. Even though their fights with Richards seem perfunctory (and the most promising one, pitting Arnold against another future real-life U.S. governor, Jesse Ventura as the toupee-wearing retired stalker Captain Freedom, never materializes), they deliver what the audience wants and add to the metahumor with their outrageous accoutrements.According to an insightful DVD commentary by Rob Cohen, Paul Michael Glazer was the fifth director assigned this film, chosen in large part for his work as a director on the quintessential '80s TV show ""Miami Vice."" You can see that glitzy neon look everywhere in this film, which both dates it and gives it much of its charm.The result is not the best-executed Arnold film, but one that leads with its strengths and not its weaknesses and keeps you enjoying the ride. It's probably Arnold's biggest cult movie except perhaps for the campier ""Commando,"" also written by de Sousa, and like ""Commando"" probably more fun because of its many faults.",The Running Man
76,gcd70,One-dimensional action film,4,21 December 2007,"Paul Michael Glaser turned this futuristic thriller from the pen of Richard Bachman (alias Stephen King) into a silly, imminently forgettable action film. Steven E. De Souza's screenplay has but one purpose, and that is to cash in on muscle bound Schwarzenegger's rising star.Arnie plays framed ex-cop Ben Richards, who is forced to participate in the 21st century's most popular game show, a sadistic man hunt which sees its ""runner"", or victim, forced to flee for his of her life from a group of very nasty ""stalkers"".Arnie's body passes the test of course, but the rest of this movie (which had a promising premise) is destroyed by some ordinary action sequences and an awful sense of humour.

77,dworldeater,' I've got to score some steroids ',10,14 January 2013,"The Running Man is my 3rd favorite Arnold Scwarzenegger flick after Conan The Barbarian and Predator(also released in 1987). The film takes place in a dystopian future where the state rules with an iron fist and the most popular show on TV is The Running Man, a game show where fugitives get hunted by juiced up sociopaths with high tech weapons.Arnold plays an escaped convict /cop who was framed for atrocities he didn't commit. Richard Dawson is the show host/ villain and does a fantastic job. Based on a story by Steven King and tailored for Arnold with Steven DeSouza's screenplay with many funny one liners as Arnie dispatches the heavies.While this is a very entertaining movie with a lot of action, there is plenty of social commentary as well.This is by no means a preachy film, but has substance and gives viewers plenty to think about if one chooses to do so. With an outstanding cast, great action and tongue in cheek humor, the film holds up real well and I continue to enjoy it every time I re watch it.",The Running Man

It's completely absurd in it's take on a dystopian future but it's the way it truly embraces the insanity that makes it work. People have to compete in a life and death game show to earn their freedom where they survive a series of video game style bosses to reach the end and salvation. Schwarzenegger is perfect here and is perfectly cast. It's a ludicrous story but I love it, totally worth watching if you can find it anywhere.",The Running Man
79,rbverhoef,Your typical action movie from the eighties,5,30 November 2003,"'The Running Man' is one of those predictable action movies that made actors like Arnold Schwarzenegger and Sylvester Stallone great. That doesn't mean there is no entertainment in a movie like this. There are a lot of funny moments and with every new villain send to kill Schwarzenegger, who is running man Ben Richards, we just have to chuckle for a moment.'The Running Man' is set in the future in a totalitarian America. Ben Richards is accused of something he didn't do, evidence against him is manipulated, and he is imprisoned. He escapes with the help of some friends and a game show host Damon Killian (Richard Dawson) sees the footage of Richards' escape. After a woman named Amber Mendes (Maria Conchita Alonso) turns him in again, Killian wants Richards for his game called The Running Man. A prisoner is send to a deserted block in the city and he must survive attacks from very heavy men. Not only he, also his friends who helped him escape and Amber are send into the game. They discover that the resistance (of course there mus be a resistance in a society like this) must be stationed in the deserted block and while fighting the bad guys they search for the resistance.You understand how predictable it all is. The movie could be better but since this is an Arnold Schwarzenegger movie it is all about the action and the one-liners, some funny, some annoying. I liked it in a way I like all those other mindless action movies from that time. Don't think too much, just watch. There is a message in a story like this, but it seems that the movie is not about that and therefor you don't care for the message. I have not read the Stephen King novel on which this movie is loosely based, but my guess is that the novel was more about the message, less about the muscles.",The Running Man
80,ArtVandelayImporterExporter,The Barfing Man,2,27 September 2021,Did they even spend a million bucks to film this pile of cr@p?The writing is weak. The soundtrack is pure 80s techno-cheese. The set design is bottom of the barrel.Yet somehow the acting is the worst thing about this farce. Arnie can't act. I still can't believe that after all these decades he's a movie star while Jean Claude Van Damme - a better actor by a mile - is relegated to straight-to-video movies. Richard Dawson is s gropey television game-show host. And Maria Conchita Alonso is the worst of all.

81,breakdownthatfilm-blogspot-com,It entertains on a mindless level,5,16 June 2015,"Science-fiction action films with hidden undercurrents are difficult to make in a number of ways. They're job in some respects is to not only entertain but also relay a certain message to its audience about the current culture that is going on around its viewers. This kind of balance has to work evenly in order for the audience to take away that subtext simultaneously while enjoying the movie. A number of sci-fi films have accomplished this like Minority Report (2002), Blade Runner (1982) or even Total Recall (1990). All of which entertained while also having ""a say"" on their own specific area in science and technology. For actor Arnold Schwarzenegger, it would not be until Total Recall (1990) that he would prove to be in a real engaging sci-fi thriller with such a clear message. That's not to say this film doesn't have that but it certainly is not as effective getting its message across.Schwarzenegger plays Benjamin Richards, a wrongly convicted helicopter pilot who was framed for the mass murder of innocent people looking for food in an apocalyptic future earth in the year 2017 (a little too soon I think). After escaping prison with a couple of fellow convicts, he attempts to flee to Hawaii with a run-in played by Maria Conchita Alonso. To Richard's dismay, he ends up getting caught and shoved into a live death battle show called ""The Running Man"" hosted by Damon Killian (Richard Dawson). This also happens to be the most watched TV show at the time. There he must fight his way out or be killed trying to be free, meanwhile billions of viewers watch. The writing, which was handled by Steven E. de Souza, has its positives and negatives. The best thing about his screenplay is that he included plenty of good dialog for Schwarzenegger to spout out to other characters. Since that is one of Schwarzenegger's strong points, it's good that de Souza was able to maintain that. It should not have been too hard though since he also wrote for Schwarzenegger's Commando (1985) as well.What de Souza does not accomplish is an intuitive and original script. All characters including Schwarzenegger's role are pretty much exactly as they are portrayed to be. The only actors who get away with it are Schwarzenegger, Alonso and Dawson because they are the characters focused on the most. Aside from Schwarzenegger and his one-liners, Alonso at least will capture her viewers' attention with her thick Hispanic accent and some close hugging costumes that she wears. I do question the costume design color and texture though. The look of it resembles that of the strange DC comic superhero known as Metamorpho. Richard Dawson is also convincing in his role as the power hungry and slimy TV host. He really makes his character unlikable in a good sense. Audiences will be able to figure out quite quickly who will live, who will die and which character will be developed further. It's unfortunate too because their are other credible actors like Yaphet Kotto, Jim Brown, Jesse Ventura and Toru Tanaka. This kind of mediocre execution is also notable when director Paul Michael Glaser is in charge. Being that he directed a slew of other unfamiliar, unpopular and unknown films like The Air Up There (1994) and Kazaam (1996), it's surprising that this one gets more attention. But then again it's probably because of Arnie. The action (which is usually obligatory in a Schwarzenegger flick) satisfies however. It's by no means over-the-top or inventive but it does keep the movie going. Pacing is an important part in storytelling so that's a plus.Sadly, this does not make up for the cinematography and music. This time around, there wasn't a whole heck of a lot to talk about. Thomas Del Ruth was the director of photography for this project. Considering he also shot frames for The Breakfast Club (1985) and Stand By Me (1986) prior to this movie, you would think there would be something to say. It's not like it's bad camera-work; there have been far worse examples. Yet, there's nothing to really highlight here. Other than maybe a couple of nicely choreographed dance numbers, the rest of the movie is just too much the same for every shot. Even more disappointing however is composer Harold Faltermeyer's musical score. Two years later Faltermeyer would compose his all out cheese fest of a score for the buddy cop action flick Tango & Cash (1989), which was beyond catchy with its main theme. Here, Faltermeyer also has a main theme but it is so weak by comparison that it disappoints more than creates a memorable listening experience.It has its moments with Schwarzenegger one-liners, consistent action and competent acting by its main actors. However, the rest of the components aren't exactly the most original. A lot of the supporting characters are predictable, the music is forgettable, the cinematography is bland and its story, which tries to have a culture related undercurrent, doesn't speak its mind enough.",The Running Man

83,lemon_magic,Blunt edged adaptation wastes the potential of a great novella,6,22 January 2006,"Warning - contains broad spoilers of the ""Running Man"" movie AND book, along with general spoilers of ""The Natural"" and the original ""Rollerball"". -------------------------------------------------------I had my doubts when I learned that Arnold would be the lead for an adaptation of Richard Bachman/Stephen King's grim little dystopian novella, ""The Running Man"". And it's pretty obvious that most of the commentators here never read the original book, because for all the merits of the movie's supposed social satire and prophetic outlook, it's a Disney version of ""Bachman's"" mean, bitter outlook and ferocious plotting. At the very least, the film has a ""happy"" ending with Arnie's character not only overcoming all his foes but starting a social revolution a-la Norman Jewison's ""Rollerball"". The book ends with the beleaguered, dying hero crashing his stolen plane into Killian's building (talk about ""prophetic""! ), killing them both in a purely feral take-you-to-hell-with-me spasm of anger and defiance. So the movie may have gotten some of the surface trappings right, but it misses the real point and mood of the original story. Of course, the same miss-the-point-by-changing-the-ending problem holds true of Redford's role in the movie adaptation of ""The Natural"", and everyone seems to agree that ""Natural"" was a fine cinematic experience.I'll go along with that. It's a typical Schwarzenegger movie, with the usual one liners and tag lines, gun play and punch-outs, as well as the the usual homo-erotic muscle guy stuff. The movie was obviously done on the cheap, but energetic pacing and direction pulls it off. It's the typical larger-than-life role that Arnold does very well, without ever needing to do more than to be himself on camera.""Running Man"" misses the mark in several spots near the end. It tries to cram in a whole bunch of contrived events to make things come out as a happy ending...and it's pretty obvious that the ending only works because the Arnold is the hero, and heroes are supposed to win. The whole scenario where ""Kimball"" and company reverse the effects of decades of propaganda with ONE 30 second ""counter broadcast"" is wishful thinking of the purest kind. Also the walk-ons by Mick Fleetwood and Dweezil Zappa are god-awful enough to make me grateful that real actors, even 2nd rate ""B"" movie and TV actors, actually work hard to master the basics of their craft so they don't stink up the celluloid they appear on like Mick and Dweezil do. (I'm not saying either of them are bad people, mind you...their roles were obviously just done for a lark.) But I did end up liking this better than ""Raw Deal"" (the previous Arnold film) because it did a better job of emphasizing and showcasing the outsized elements of Arnold's screen presence.There's no justifying a movie like ""Running Man"" as anything but escapist action and trashy entertainment. There's nothing wrong with that, though. And if you're going to build your movie around car chases, you might as well have the hero drive a Hummer through a plate glass window while firing an assault rifles out the door and punching his passenger in the jaw. ""Running Man"" justifies itself by getting right to the Hummer and the punching, if you know what I mean.",The Running Man
84,PredragReviews,The future is the 80's.,7,7 May 2016,"Efficient action movie vehicle for Schwarzenegger, starring as a framed convicted killer who becomes one of the contestants in sick television game show. He's pursued across a devastated Los Angeles in the year 2019 by trained hit-man. Stephen King's novel with its echoes of The Most Dangerous Game, provides an effective framework for Arnie's tough-guy act, and director Glaser expertly orchestrates the state-of-the-art special effects, nasty violence and unpleasant humor. All I've forgotten is the Girl. All movies like this need a Girl, whose function is to be pulled helplessly behind the hero as he attempts his escape. By casting Maria Conchita Alonso in the role, the filmmakers got more than they bargained for; she remains one of Hollywood's undaunted high spirits, a nice comic counterfoil for Schwarzenegger. The movie's problem is that all of the action scenes are versions of the same scenario. TV host Dawson introduces a killer and his trademark weapons (electrical shock, fire, chain saws, etc.) and then Schwarzenegger faces him in battle. The one element in the movie that is not standard and that does have some energy is the TV show itself, with Dawson's performance as the egotistical, sleaze-bag host.This film uses the likes of rich corporate adults as the shows mainstream audience loving fellons get butchered the same way. The films special effects are ahead of its time, with believable gore and movie props like futuristic cars and buildings. Richard Dawson is great as the game-show's host, as a lovable teddy bear on screen, and a greedy, self-involved liar backstage. The remaining cast do their jobs well, although they could have found more talented actors. Arnold is Arnold, without him, this movie wouldn't have the box-office appeal that it did, nor would it have the appeal on todays audience that it did. And even though his one liners after each death border on stupidity in this film (with a lot of the other dialogue), his Arnoldness simply makes up for it.

85,Sandcooler,Cheesy favorite,9,2 January 2016,"There's a lot I don't understand about the movies (see other reviews for proof), but why do sci-fi movies always have to talk exact dates? Why does this have to be set in 2019, rather than just some unspecified future where they somehow still have 80s fashion (it's still got three years to return)? You know the details are going to look stupid, even though the basic story doesn't seem far off: we are being lied to, privacy is becoming a privilege rather than a right, and TV shows are getting more tasteless in a desperate (but effective) search for ratings. What I appreciate most about ""The Running Man"" though is that it doesn't cram in the social commentary, it's prime goal is entertainment. Arnold Schwarzenegger is the best perfect lead here, and the villains are just hilariously weird. You know Arnold is going to get rid of every opponent they send him, but it's still satisfying to see it done. The ending is a little rushed and requires a really sloppy kind of totalitarian government, but I wasn't into this for the realism.",The Running Man

Glaser, Arnie and Richard Dawson succeeds!",7,10 August 2005,"Sure, it's dated, but this film succeeds in the action sci-fi genre where many films, especially since CGI has become a substitute for creativity, fail miserably. The elements are all here for either a disaster or a great work. Paul Michael Glaser directing, the totally hit-or-miss Arnold Schwarzeneggar in the lead role, Stephen King - whose films are often either impossible to follow if you haven't read the books or absolutely brilliant, and ..... Richard Dawson playing a role he seems born to play. What an amazing bit of casting this film offers. The Running Man presents one of Schwarzeneggar's best and most developed roles, Maria Conchita Alonso as a more-or less perfect co-star, Richard Dawson as a semi-satanic version of himself playing Family Feud with people's lives. And it just gets better. Jesse Ventura plays somebody more or less like Jesse Ventura (great choice for him considering some of his other outings). The always likable Jim Brown plays a flamethrowing super-villain. Erland Van Lieth as an opera singing psychopath armed with amped up tasers. Yaphet Kotto playing a revolutionary escaped prisoner. Sven Thorsen playing a guy named Sven. I could go on but you should get the point by now.Stephen King's (as Richard Bachman) original story is about a culture which has gone very wrong. It's a world where people are drugged-out on TV shows which look a lot like what we today call ""reality TV"", while mass murder is being performed by police and the military, thousands of people are rioting due to hunger, and lots of easily imaginable awful things occur daily. Arnie starts out as a police helicopter pilot who is ordered to fire on a crowd of unarmed starving civilians during a food riot. He disobeys his orders and ends up in jail, where he meets Yaphet Kotto and, predictably, they engineer an escape. Refusing to join Kotto's resistance, Arnie tries to create his own path by kidnapping Maria Conchita Alonso. And he ends up playing Killian's (Dawson) game - The Running Man. Once Dawson really enters the film, in the role of his lifetime, the fun really begins! This is a truly entertaining film - briskly paced, plot-heavy, and, at times, almost poignant. It does a nice, campy, interpretation of King's book without the politics and philosophical ideas. The Running Man also plays subtle homages to classic predecessors of the genre such as Terminator, Blade Runner, and Death Race 2000. Having read everything Stephen King has ever published (with the exception of a few of his rare early works), I enjoy almost every film he is involved in. Unlike many of Stephen King's films, however, this is not really a fan film. This is a film most sci-fi and action fans will enjoy.Recommended!",The Running Man
89,brchthethird,Aesthetically dated but thematically prescient,8,14 November 2014,"Despite some rather dated elements and too conventional of an ending, THE RUNNING MAN is one of Arnold's best movies and a brilliantly subversive (and prescient) take on entertainment culture, ""reality"" TV and American obsession with celebrity. The movie takes place in the future (2017) and the story is about this game show where contestants are convicts who try to outrun ""stalkers"" who are trying to kill them. All of it is broadcast live to the country where people bet on who will kill who and cheer on their favorites. The dystopian future that the film creates is one that resonates particularly in the themes and ideas that is presents, even if the fashion sense and music give it a little too much of an 80's feel. The performances from the cast are mostly good, with Richard Dawson being a standout as the show runner Damon Killian. His over-the-top performance made it seem like he understood the satire that the movie was going for. Jesse Ventura also had a small, but memorable, role as a former stalker-turned-TV personality. Arnold was good as usual, and this movie has (in my opinion) some of his best lines. One in particular that I liked was a moment in the film where he manhandles a surveillance/TV camera and threatens to ram his fist into Killian. Outside of the big lines he's known for, that one might actually be the best one. Overall, the movie does a really great job of establishing the world in it, but I felt that the movie was wrapped up in a cliché manner. Instead of going for a more gonzo ending, they opted for a standard shoot-em-up finale where the hero walks away with the girl. While it doesn't detract too much from the overall product, it was a little disappointing given how strong the movie started out. In addition to the satirical elements I mentioned before, I also gleaned that the movie may be implicating the audience as well, given that the audience in the film never really changes. They only change their allegiances as circumstances change rather than revolting against a clearly corrupt and deceptive system like the resistance in the film does. They also could have fleshed out that part of the movie more as well. Still, THE RUNNING MAN is a must-watch film for Arnie fans, and fans of this type of satire.",The Running Man

91,hnt_dnl,Fun Arnie flick that's prescient!,9,20 January 2009,"Having seen THE RUNNING MAN(1987) a slew of times, while the first few years I watched it, it was always mainly a guilty pleasure and fun movie to watch, I now realize how much foreshadowing is involved. Now, any movie I can watch repeatedly and not tire of it gets my vote as a good flick, but THE RUNNING MAN has somehow manage to elevate itself over the years as much more than that. It is yet another Arnold Schwarzenegger gem from the 1980s. Seriously, Arnie probably made more entertaining movies in the first 10 years of his career than most actors can lay claim to in their entire career!A futuristic film that is not so futuristic in terms of technology now that we know what the 21st century looks like (what 80s flick is?), this flick has so much more going for it. And the rather dated technology has a nostalgic appeal that many 80s movies still have. Actually, the technology is not that bad, and dare I say it, even cool-looking in parts. I especially like the futuristic outfits that the cast wears. It actually doesn't look ridiculous and one can even envision a future where people will dress like this.What makes TRM original and prescient is it's premise: a game show where the contestants fight on a reality TV show for their lives! The contestants, hardened 'criminals' must navigate through an underground city maze and defend themselves against a plethora of crazed ""Stalkers"" on a game-show that shares the film's title. The host of this show is Killian (played by none other than the original, iconic real game-show 'Family Feud' host Richard Dawson). This is one of the best examples of casting TO type in any film I've ever seen! Dawson is terrific, utterly convincing as a heartless, ruthless host of a diabolical show. Of course Arnie delivers as the film's lead, as usual. Arnie plays Ben Richards, a framed cop falsely accused of mass murder in the film's opening sequence, then wrongly imprisoned. After a few months, Richards and some fellow inmates, including a do-gooder (solidly played by Yaphet Kotto) and a computer hacker, escape and go their separate ways, but not for long before they are all captured and forced to participate on the brutal game show.Maria Conchita Alonso is very memorable and makes the most of her role as the vivacious Amber, an initial thorn in Richards' side, who evolves into an ally for Richards and his crew as they all must work together to try to survive the game. Icons Jesse Ventura and Jim Brown also make good impressions (especially Ventura) as 2 of the Stalkers. Mick Fleetwood also has a wonderful brief couple of cameo scenes as the leader of the Resistance fighting the militaristic, totalitarian government.Having re-watched TRM a few times in later years, I realize now how prescient it is as modern television has become bombarded with reality shows. All the major networks have them. All the OTHER networks have them! They are everywhere. Back when TRM came out, reality shows really didn't exist. Sitcoms, nighttime soaps, silly fantasy shows, and cop dramas were all the rage! Ironically, ""Survivor"", which started in the 90s and has a vein that is crazily similar to TRM, was probably the first popular game-show style reality series that eventually led to all that is on now. Viewers cheer for and against, egg on, and vote on their favorites to win or lose much like the audience members in TRM. While carrying an actual message and being provocative, THE RUNNING MAN is also, thankfully, one of those totally re-watchable 80s flicks that, while one might chuckle at some of the skewed technological vision of the future, it also possesses at it's core a fancy-free element of fun. The look and feel of the future manages to be simultaneously colorful-looking and bleak. The design and setup of TRM game show itself is very impressive with a stylish set, great techno dance music, and backup dancers, and the genius casting of Dawson to give it ambiance.Directed by none other than 70s icon Paul Michael Glaser (the Starsky half of ""Starsky and Hutch""), populated with great Arnie puns and one-liners, a very capable supporting cast, a fast-pace, and satisfying ending, THE RUNNING MAN is both an iconic 80s nostalgic piece AND a foreshadowing of things to come!",The Running Man
92,fmarkland32,Reality television...,7,12 June 2006,"Arnold Schwarzenegger stars as Ben Richards AKA The Butcher of Baker's Field Massacre, who becomes a contestant on ""The Running Man"" where various criminals play a game in which the prize is a ""Trial by jury"" 'A suspended sentence"" and even a ""Full pardon"" however nobody has ever won due to the stalker's painful advantage, this is until Schwarzenegger starts playing. There were few things that we teenagers looked forward to in the 80's, one was sex and two were summer action movies with big body counts. The Running Man at the time was a surreal action flick and although I loved it, I figured on rewatch this would be nothing but a two star nostalgia fueled movie.(Kickboxer sequels) However The Running Man interestingly predicted the reality television craze and although it's fairly exaggerated, the future elements make this a movie that has aged fairly well. The soundtrack makes it feel really 80's but I for one loved the imagination taken with the material. As a teenager though I doubt I got any of the satire and jokes that basically took shots at us the main audience however in hindsight The Running Man is a fascinating feature which works not only as a Schwarzenegger action flick but also as a sly satire on Reality TV and basically us in general.* * * out of 4-(Good)",The Running Man
93,phubbs,The Running Man,6,23 November 2014,"Probably the first Arnie vehicle I ever saw as a kid and even then I thought it was average. Yes I know this could be seen as heresy but I must confess to never thinking a great deal about this film despite being a life long Arnie fan.We all know the score with this film by now. The plot is based loosely on a Stephen King novel which is all about America being a police or totalitarian state, huge divides between the rich and the poor and of course death and violence being a popular much watched sport on TV. So basically a futuristic view on the ancient Roman civilisation and their bloody culture.If you think about it its the perfect role for Arnie and various other muscle men just like many other Arnie films, this film pretty much started that craze. Today this kind of story is completely unoriginal but back then it was almost the first of its kind. To be fair its a video game adaptation all the way, Arnie's character must face each stalker one by one, each has their own unique skill or weapon and they all have their personal level or stage as it were. Guess what Sub Zero's stage looks like?The stalkers are pretty clichéd and generic now when you look back, Fireball Sub Zero Dynamo Buzzsaw and Captain Freedom, not hard to figure out what they all do...accept for Freedom perhaps. A pumped bunch to say the least, Ventura looks full on steroids with his silly wig whilst Brown has a ridiculous wig himself (I think). The other stalker cast members aren't as famous accept for Charles Kalani Jr. perhaps but 80's female action sidekick regular María Conchita Alonso alongside Yaphet Kotto hold their own.Of course the film is made by the excellent performance of Richard Dawson who takes a creepy direction on what was his current job at the time as a gameshow host. Not only does Dawson ham it up nicely but he adds a very eerie, sadistic, two faced approach to the role. Its actually quite fun to watch him crawl and grovel to the audience. A real slime ball deviously charming the gullible live audience, whilst virtually blackmailing them for their trust and ratings by lavishing easy prizes upon them with seemingly genuine generosity. It did make you wonder if this was how real gameshow hosts behaved behind closed doors but I imagine that was the goal.The film does look pretty cheap, it did even back then. Sets are not much more than big empty spaces with stark lighting effects and piles of rubble everywhere. Hell even the costumes look like they've been handmade by the cast themselves. Lots of spandex, a basic ice hockey uniform, lots of leather n chains for background thugs and the most bizarre concept for Dynamo who is covered in what looks like Christmas tree lights stuck on transparent plastic body sections. Why does he sing opera? judging by his helmet its a homage or calling to 'Ride of the Valkyries' and the character is clearly trying to impose fear and terror on his pending victims as he rides his buggy thing into battle. Doesn't work too well though huh.Quick one for you, who on earth knows what Captain Freedom's outfit was suppose to do or be? looked like something out of He-Man. There's a lot more hinting at moments than actual visual sequences but there is the odd classic moment. I'm sure everyone recalls the infamous head explosion sequence, the ultra fast toboggan thing that transports Arnie down to the gauntlet game zone and Arnie slamming a pen into some scrawny pen pushing suits back...wince moment...ouch!Its your classic dystopian futuristic 80's action flick obviously, with the classic update of gladiatorial battles for the blood thirsty masses. Many have copied it but clearly this borrowed from other sources also ('Escape from New York' visually). Jammed packed with all the Arnie one liners you could want, dancing big haired blondes, some good bloody moments and a perfectly sleazy performance by real ex-gameshow host Dawson as the manipulative gameshow host Killian (nasty sounding name also).Predictable of course but its fun to watch the audience and viewers slowly get behind Richards as he defeats the stalkers one at a time. Watching Killian and his yes men squirm as they know Richards is coming to get them. A bit silly how this one act of rebellion seems to bring down the whole corrupt system as the resistance starts to broadcast the truth and everybody just believes it straight away but hey...its an Arnie film.'I told Killian I'd be back. I wouldn't want to be a liar'6/10",The Running Man
94,DarthBill,Reality TV run amok!,7,7 April 2004,"Trashy looking and predictably fun Arnold vehicle based on a Stephen King novel (which he wrote under the name Richard Bachman) has Arnold as a cop turned into a scape goat for the government to pawn off the murder of protesting civilians who escapes prison, only to be recaptured and forced to play the ultimate reality TV show - ""The Running Man"", in which he must outwit and overpower a group of sadistic killers called ""stalkers"" who are armed with razor bladed hockey sticks, chainsaws, death rays and flame throwers. Will he survive?Professional Wrestler Jesse Ventura, who played one of Arnold's soldiers in ""Predator"", plays the one ""stalker"" who wants to fight Arnold hand to hand. Ironically, both men later wound up in politics.Dark lighting, a very 80s soundtrack and wardrobe, and ironically, a self mocking Richard Dawson provides a better foil to Arnold than any of the stalkers do, at least in terms of his personality. Arnold is fun to watch as usual, and somehow he looks better with a beard. If this movie were being made now, it would be called a comment on reality TV and the lengths networks will go to entertain the public, and in a way, it kind of was then. And like all women, Maria Conchita Alonso looks better with her hair down.",The Running Man

He is a cool one. Maria Conchita Alonso is seriously sexy, really appreciate her what a great casting. If this movie were recast today a bigger star may have gotten her role because The Running Man's so classic. Maria's so beautiful especially once she gets into her Running Man suit providing all the sexiness 1 requires. I love Maria Conchita Alonso so. TRM has a great story that plays out. It's easy to confuse The Running Man with Total Recall being all the similarities.",The Running Man
96,ivo-cobra8,The Running Man is all time Entertaining very fast Sci-Fi Action flick,10,15 October 2015,"The Running Man is a 1987 American science fiction action film loosely based on the 1982 novel The Running Man, written by Stephen King and published under the pseudonym Richard Bachman. Directed by Paul Michael Glaser, the film stars Arnold Schwarzenegger, María Conchita Alonso, Jesse Ventura, Jim Brown, and Richard Dawson (in his final film). The Running Man is always all time Entertaining very fast entertaining Sci-Fi Action by novel ever made. My in depth movie review and retrospective of the underrated 80's sci-fi action classic, and one of my personal favorite films. As a kid I always loved this movie is the third best action movie in my opinion I love The Running Man to death, this movie was also made after success of Predator with co starring Jesse Ventura who opposite started with Schwarzenegger in Predator. Very underrated 80's sci-fi action classic, and one of my personal favorite films, I love this movie to death is my number 3 best Arnold Schwarzenegger movie.The film is very underrated and very bashed and hated from the other critics and fans. In my opinion is very great fun Science Fiction Action film about a convicts who has to fight for survival in a game show. The film, set in a dystopian America between 2017 and 2019, is about a television show called The Running Man, where convicted criminal ""runners"" must escape death at the hands of professional killers.1987 was a busy year for Arnold Schwarzenegger. Given his meteoric rise into the ranks of Hollywood's action elite, he accepted the opportunity to play the leading role in two science fiction films within the same year (Predator and The Running Man). The themes and setting couldn't have been more distant, yet they both garnered widespread acclaim, and helped bolster the former bodybuilder's career. I've always felt Predator is a superior picture to The Running Man (and imagine most sci-fi fans would agree), but when it comes to pure mindless entertainment, this is the disc to reach for.The action sequences were great outstanding, the CGI wasn't in it at all, it was barely in it. The film is fast and very Entertained. The Running Man may not be the greatest 80's action flick, but it's still a relevant entry in the genre and well worth your time. Arnold Schwarzenegger was very very skeptical of Paul Michael Glazer been the director of the movie. And he thought it was terrible choose for Pal Michael Glazer because he was the last replacement. For me the film is fine and It doesn't look like a TV show. I don't think it is a TV show. I have enjoyed very much as anyone else did. I think The Running Man it's a film that it is a lot of deeper than people are giving a credits for. I really enjoy this underrated 1987 Sci-fi action film with Arnold Schwarzenegger! It was fun, pure adrenaline pumping game show-typed flick that's set in a futuristic time, loosely based on a Stephen King novel. It was great to see Richard Dawson coming from the original Family Feud to played an evil game show host. Lots of great action scenes all around. Arnold delivering his one liners w/ perfect timing....such a shame this film wasn't a big hit...but its now a cult classic. I always think Maria Alonso, Arnold's hottest co star. They have great chemistry. Maria is Arnold's type,I wish they had more scenes together.THE YEAR IS 2019. Television is now ruling people's lives. The most popular ""audience participation"" game show is ""The Running Man""-where convicts can win pardons instead of ""parting gifts"" by defeating murderous henchman known as ""stalkers."" The stalkers haven't had much of a challenge lately...until Ben Richards (Schwarzenegger) comes along.
The Running Man (1987) is a cult classic film with Arnold Schwarzenegger based on Stephen King's Novel the most underrated film and one of my all time favorite films, I love this film to death. The stalkers in the game show: Pofessor Subzero, Buzzsaw, Captain Freedom, Fireball and Dynamo are one the most memorable characters in the film, Professor Toru Tanaka,Gus Rethwisch, Jesse Ventura, Jim Brown and Erland Van Lidth De Jeude did a wonderful job portraying the stalkers in the game show in the film. Ben Richards is actually Arnold Schwarzenegger most memorable character of all time. I love the theme Music from Harold Faltermeyer and I love that film is set in the future that is what I love in this film. 7 B+",The Running Man
97,The_Movie_Cat,"""If you're not ready to act, give me a break and shut up!""",5,24 May 2001,"That's what the director said to Schwarzenegger  tee-hee!Seriously though, this dumber than dumb run-around is actually quite good fun, even if its depiction of 2018 is no longer valid. With its late-80s obsessions about aerobics, disco and stretchy perms, this is never going to overtake Blade Runner as the acceptable vision of the future, though I hardly think the people behind the film would lose any sleep over it. It even ends with a cheesy MOR pop ballad to complement the skinny ties.Any Stephen King-derived material is already too obvious in satirical intent. Rewrite said satire as a Schwarz action movie and you've eked out any subtlety you hoped to savour. An Arnhuld satire ultimately fails to work because you know that the socio-commentary is really the least of the maker's concerns. It's just a perfunctory addition to what is an excuse to let Arnie indulge in some violence and rubbish puns. (""He had to split"" and ""He was a real pain in the neck"" being the er... best?  the inclusion of useless catchphrase ""I'll be back"" is also an irritation) The lame The 6th Day paid lip service to eugenics while at heart being a very dumb shoot-em-up. The Running Man is more stylish than that (Thanks largely due to Harold Faltermeyer's synth incidentals, incongruous with the action format) though is still fundamentally the same. Its pretence as a condemnation of media violence is also clearly hypocritical. Or maybe it's just seeing Republican Arnie pretending to be Liberal that jars. The rather silly about-face of the audience (Agnes's line is amusingly overdubbed on UK TV to a softened ""That boy's one mean bugger"") is also grating.In acting terms, Richard Dawson, a real-life game show host, is particularly good, though Yaphet Kotto is wasted on a few meagre lines. Even less acceptably, women are tied up, pushed around, dressed in skimpy leotards and fantasise about rape while men attempt it. This is a film as pure testosterone; all feminine content specially isolated and removed. The fact that such scenes could be served up as entertainment is questionable.Not the best of Arnold's modest back catalogue yet not the worst either. Tripe, but watchable tripe. 5/10",The Running Man
98,aesgaard41,This Was Based On A Stephen King Novel?,8,21 December 2000,"I've only cared for King's horror novels, such as It, Shining and Salem's Lot, but this movie may have been based on man's fascination for violence and King's views on where our future may be heading. In this future, the government is ruled by a dictatorial totalitarian regime which uses television violence, escapism and sensationalism in a future coliseum to subdue and distract a rioting dissatisfied general public. This merger of government and entertainment allows for many TV parodies such as those seen in ""Stay Tuned"" as psychos become government employees hired to kill, maim and just murder potential dissidents for public TV. Enter Arnold as the likeable guy framed for a crime he didn't commit because he wouldn't take out orders to kill civilians. Richard Dawson plays up his role as a demented talk show host (If only Colonel Hogan saw what he had become, he'd have turned him over to the Nazis !), and Maria Conchito Alonzo plays her role as the female sidekick somewhat distracted and out of place half the time. Future Mayor Jesse ""The Body"" Ventura hams up and mugs his way through  his scenes as Yaphet Kotto puts so much into his role that for him to die early in the film must have been a breath for air. There's some light comedy and black humor in this as the movie is constantly side-tracked with promos for its fictitious psycho TV shows. It's a typical Arnold Schwarzeneggar movie with Sci-Fi undertones and an anticlimactic ending.",The Running Man
99,itamarscomix,Holds up surprisingly well,7,16 June 2012,"The Running Man won't appear on anybody's list of best Stephen King adaptation (there's hardly any similarity between the novella and the movie) and as far as sci-fi movies from the 80's go it's a far cry from intelligent, brooding pieces like Blade Runner, Alien, 1984 or heck, even Back to the Future. But in spite of all its flaws - the clunky, campy vision of the future; Schwarzenegger's performance that is bad even by his meager standards; the script full of silly puns and one-liners - it's still very watchable, very entertaining, and even, at times, poignant and effective.Despite taking it in a much lighter and more campy direction, the movie managed to maintain the main points King was trying to get across, and those are still relevant; while The Running Man TV show is clearly defined as a spoof of pro-wrestling and the growing fondness for violence in entertainment, it's every bit as easy to compare it to today's reality shows, and it should be remembered that it predates The Hunger Games, Battle Royale, Black Mirror and other movies and novels that toyed with similar ideas. Arnie and everyone else ham it up a bit too much for the analogy, and the cautionary tale that hides beneath the surface, to really be taken seriously, but Richard Dawson as the sleazy host is enough to sell it, and he delivers the best performance of the movie and one of the best villains of the 80's.When all's said and done, it's important to remember that The Running Man is still a movie which was made in the 80's, starring Arnold Schwarzenegger. That should be enough to clarify that it's not to be taken too seriously, and that plot holes and bad acting come with the territory. If you watch it seeking nothing but silly entertainment and action, you'll get all that, and maybe a little bit of subtext while you're at it.",The Running Man
100,BroadswordCallinDannyBoy,Rollerball...for dummies,8,28 March 2004,"One of Arnie's better actioners. Takes place in the future and is about a violent game show in which prisoners are forced into an arena and must escape ""athletes"" with all sorts of weapons. The audience places bets and everyone is captivated by this show. That draws some parallels to Rollerball, but this movie is more about the action than social commentary.Quite predictably Arnie is a wrongfully accused prisoner and he decides to set the record straight and get revenge on the game show people and expose the truth to audience. There are great action sequences and good one liners mixed into the ""Rollerball for dummies"" storyline. However it's a great movie despite that last point and the film manages to entertain both action fans and people who enjoy some thought behind their action films. 8/10Rated R: violence and profanity",The Running Man

102,Maziun,Much more than just a action movie with Schwarzenegger,6,17 May 2013,"The movie is inspired by the book "" The running man"" by Richard Bachmann (aka Stephen King) . I haven't read the book , but I believe the people who say that the movie is dumbed down version of the book. Still , I think it's a good movie with some substance and cool action. It's a small classic in its own right . It's one of more intelligent Schwarzenegger movies. Interesting trivia – Dolph Lundgren was supposed to be the main star , but something didn't work out.Do you believe in everything they tell you on TV ? When they tell you who is good and who is bad , who is a friend and who is an enemy ? How do you know that your not manipulated ? That they show you what they want to show ? "" The running man "" asks all this questions.The movie is also a satire on TV audiences . We already have ugly reality shows like "" Fear Factor"" . We - the audience – want more . More blood , sweat and tears . We don't want ""nice"" entertainment anymore . We are already fascinated by movies like "" Saw"" . So , the next logical step will be a TV show like "" The running man "" . Why not ? The producers will give us what we want ( at least the most of us ) as long as we will give them money . I really believe that one day a TV show like this will be made . The movie also predicts that in 2017 there will be international crisis. When I'm writing those words we have year 2013 and things aren't looking too good . Who knows ? Maybe they will be right with this prophecy too ? From all the science fiction movies I've seen this seems the most actual today .The movie is full of colorful and memorable characters. Jesse Ventura gives a real funny performance as Captain Freedom – ex-hunter with huge ego and his own code of honor. Richard Dawson is a lovely asshole as the TV host . It's always good to have Yaphet Kotto in the cast . Schwarzenegger is Schwarzenegger – enough said. The only weak point is Maria Conchita Alonso . She barely speaks decent English and doesn't bring much to her role. Watch out for professor Toru Tanaka ( Oddjob from ""Goldfinger"" ) in small role of Subzero – the first hunter in the movie.Steven Souza ( ""Commando"" , "" Die hard"" ) knows how to write funny and cheesy one-liners and "" The running man "" also has a couple of them (""Need a lift ? "" ). Harold Faltermeyer ( Beverly Hills Cop , Fletch"" , "" Tango and Cash "" ) is the author of the music. The music unfortunately is just OK , nothing memorable here. The action is solid and only ending seems kinda lame.Overall , this is fun and quite smart movie .Better watch this instead of ""Avatar"". I give it 7/10.",The Running Man

I got something really bad and that's really all there is.In the year 2016, people enjoys the insanity TV shows that rolls 24 hours a day on TV. Arnie plays a ex-military that is accused for a murder on dozens of innocent people, something that's all made up! Arnie escapes from the prison together with two friends and heads for safety. But he never gets there, and soon he and his buddies (and a chick he met) is stars in the lunatic show called THE RUNNING MAN. In this show people must fight against wild hunters...and anything goes!Very silly movie! Either Arnie is fighting a really ugly Buzzsaw or heis fighting a irritatingly ugly Fireball, the movie never gets in any direction more exciting or entertaining. The action scenes are all terribly bad made, and with some action this really doesn't help the movie on its way. Schwarzenegger seems to be very un-focused, as in the most of his movies, and this just adds the famous Arnie twist into this idiotic movie! Although it's better than Arnie's HERCULES and CONAN, it's so silly in the first place that it really just lays there cooking in a irritatingly bad heat.

It shows clearly that he is not a good actor and initial impressions are poor. The film is embarrassing to watch for idiocy until Arnie is released to be The Running Man. Then it livens up and the action begins.

Arnold Schwarzenegger plays the wrongly accused, former soldier and delivers some of his best, and worst, one liners. The movie has gained more significance in the reality TV era, but in fact, it's human nature that stretches back to looking at people on the cross and in the arena. Most of the praise for the success of this movie should go to Richard Dawson, the deposed host of Family Feud. Dawson easily overpowers Schwarzenegger with his presence. He was fired from the Feud for his role in this movie, but he is the MC devil of the hell that is The Running Man.P.S.

But, it is, none the less, a darn entertaining movie, albeit it is flawed almost beyond repair.As a movie, TRM is a bit above Sylvester Stallones worst 80's action, Cobra, but it still is miles ahead of it what becomes into action, script and the settings.In the future U.S.A is transformed into a police state, in which the masses are entertained via violent TV show, The Running Man, in which convicts try to survive in a deadly maze, hunted by sadistic gladiators. Arnold is Ben Richards, a police, who's set up for a massacre of civilians and he ends up into The Running Mas show.

It's a dangerous reality game show where convicts are forced to go in a urban labyrinth of danger for they suffer live on TV, however a former cop named Ben Richards (Arnold Schwarzenger) is framed for a crime he didn't commit. He has escaped from prison as he wants to prove his innocence but suddenly he becomes a contestant on the show for he must play the game for scumbag host Damon Killan (Richard Dawson) for after the game he must try to expose the truth behind the fascist show.Exciting and underrated cult Sci-fi action thriller fave loosely based on a Stephen King novel. Schwartzenger delivers the goods as Richards even with some witty one-liners like ""Well that hit the spot!"" and co-stars Yaphett Kotto and Maria Conchita Alonso. I also love how the movie incorporates Orwell-esquire social satire in it about the American media and how peoples lives are effected by it, including how it could push us in our faces as being fascist as it could be fought back.Highly recommended, it's great smart action-packed fun!

111,PeterMitchell-506-564364,"A eager charged action gem, a great way to start off movie '88",8,12 April 2013,"This is just one movie I watched, and watched, and watched, and watched. I fell in love with it, the first time I saw it. This sci fi action pic, walks a different beat to Arnie's other flicks, prior, with it's originality, colorfully shot scenes, with a display of some really over the top bad guys. It has an amazing energy about it, that makes it DY-NO-MITE! It never dulls, although it doesn't have the best hero lead. My favorite AS movie, it stands alone to all of Arnie's others for just these reasons. And here, again we have a great story, including it's pre history of Arnie's character, a cop who was framed for the massacre of hundreds of people, earning a not so nice so nickname. It's the future all over again, 2029, and t.v. ratings have never hit higher, for there's a sadistic survival sport killer show, known as The Running Man. Contestants pick the killers, big guys with instruments of death, whether flame throwers, pics, chainsaws, where they chase down their unfortunate victims, who like Arnie, are framed, and made to look bad. So it's a hunt down in an arena of death in fronts of hundreds of cameras, and revenge hungry spectators. Another added bonus is the really bad guy running the show, Killian, played by the last great Richard Dawson, who's flawless performance, which just the right amount of nastiness, will always live on in my mind. It was one of the great villainous performances. Killian cares about no one, not his posse of bent employers or the janitor, he fires for being too slow. All he cares about, is ratings. There's never a dull moment to spare in this. If anyone, accused this movie of ever being dull, they should seriously be put on trial. As Arnie fights the bad asses, he uses that legendary line again on Killian, ""I'll be back"", and we know Arnie's man on his word. There's some nasty violence, other bits inferred, rather than shown, from which a few of the best Arnie one liners, spout out in his block dialogue. I loved the sleighs, shooting through the tunnels, at insane speed, transporting the sorry players down to the wide open game zone, not a ride I liked to take. Jim Brown rocked in the movie as Fireball, and Jesse Ventura was funny, a player, who's killed, but falsely made to look the winner, which can easily be done within the corrupt confines of this illegitimate network. The end song was awesome. God knows, I'd love to have it on my c.d. The movie rules, only marred some by Arnie, not strong enough in his role, out acted by his peers, as some really good character acting transpires here, over the interesting roguish dialogue of the script, co written by one guy who's co written his share of scripts. This vehicle of excitement evolved from a novel by Richard Bachman, which would be a hell of a read. Dawson was great, when he cowered near the, confronted by Arnie, Dawson truly deserve'd of his acting acolade. There will never be another flick such as this. Run it Arnie.",The Running Man
112,Antagonisten,Accent at it's peak,5,2 February 2005,"This is one of the movies starring Arnold Schwarzenegger i remember seeing as a kid. That was back when he was the ultimate action star and movies like these seemed the most thrilling things around.The helicopter-pilot Ben Richards (Schwarzenegger) is falsely convicted of murder when he defies an order to shoot at civilians. At a prison break he is caught on camera and catches the interest of a production company that produces the most popular show on TV: The Running Man. There convicts are chased by hunters, and either escape to freedom or are killed in the process.This is about as genuine as a 1980's Schwarzenegger movie gets. The real deal! This is what Arnold is all about. Him running around flexing his muscles while killing scores of bad guys. Also this movie has a more interesting setup than most of his 1980's action outings. That is, it has a story at all. And today this story doesn't feel all that unrealistic either. Because game shows and reality shows on TV today basically show everything except people getting killed. So who knows what the producers will do to stretch the limits next time? Anyway. The story is no masterpiece. The action is decent enough though, and there are a few nice touches that makes this a tad more entertaining than most similar movies. Also one can always just sit back and enjoy Arnolds accent that is at the peak of it's form. So in the world of Arnold this is an 8/10. In the world of action movies it's a 5/10.",The Running Man

114,malkane316,Quick Reviews!!,8,22 November 2004,"POSSIBLE SPOILERS!!Another classic 80's Arnie film, adapted from the Stephen King short which tells of a future where reality TV is the height of entertainment. Sounds familiar? Arnie and his friends, former prisoners framed for various crimes are put in The Running Man game show as contestants, because the show's director feels they can boost his ratings. As an added surprise he throws in Amber, a woman Arnie tried to use to escape the city, claiming they worked and slept together. The game sees the players fighting their way through various areas of an underground city against a number of bad guys (the good guys in the audience's opinion, and are hailed as Gods). Of course Arnie dispatches of them, each with a Bond-like one liner, but not without casualties. Arnie meets a group of rebels, and together they prepare to take down the show, exposing its corruption. Watch it either as satire or action as it succeeds on both counts. Some dodgy music and costumes though, but that hardly spoils it. 8 out of 10",The Running Man
115,EthanBJones_03,Fun little action flick which is dated today,6,15 August 2016,"Overall: This movie is a fun, one time watch maybe with some friends. Other than that I wouldn't watch it.Good: The concept is quite cool even if it isn't explained that well. Good performances all around, especially from the host of the show.Bad: Again the actual show isn't explained that well and the movie feels slow through it's opening act. I nearly fell asleep during the whole setup stage which just felt like setup and not in the flow of the movie. The so-called STALKERS which are the shows 'main attraction' are boring and could have been so much more creative. The movie is set in the future so it makes sense for weird and wacky stalkers that could make the movie more interesting. Schwartenenengers trademark one liners are present but overstay their welcome after the first few. This movie is also pretty old and its effects haven't aged that well but that is just nitpicking. Best Part: The fight scene versus Sub Zero was quite fun and more interesting than the others.6/10",The Running Man
116,Mort-31,Brutality in glaudy colours,2,5 February 2001,"Maybe television will be as brutal one day. Maybe Big Brother` was only the first step in the direction Stephen Richard Bachmann` King described the end point of. But enough about that. If I spend too much words talking about the serious background topic of this movie I do exactly what the producers hoped by choosing this material. It's the same with The 6th Day`. No matter, how primitive the film is, it provokes a discussion about its topic, which serves the producers as publicity. Let's NOT be taken in by that. The social criticism that is suggested by that plot summary is only an alibi to make it possible to produce a speculative, violent movie, more for video sale than for cinema. I didn't read the book. I don't dare criticising Stephen King without having read him, but when I saw the film I thought they couldn't make such a terrible film out of a good book: In a typical 1980s set with 1980s music and some minor actors Arnold Schwarzenegger finds himself as a policeman running away from killers within a cruel TV show. The audience is cheering.
Together with Predator`, this is definitely Schwarzenegger's most stupid movie. 2 stars out of 10.",The Running Man

118,jcbutthead86,A Terrific And Entertaining SCI-FI/Action/Thriller. Arnold Schwarzenegger At His Best.,10,19 August 2015,"The Running Man is a terrific and entertaining SCI-FI/Action/Thriller that combines fantastic direction,a wonderful cast,amazing Action and a fine score. All of those elements make The Running Man a fantastic SCI-FI-Action-Thriller that is Arnold Schwarzenegger at his best.Based on the novel by Stephen King(writing under the name Richard Bachman)and set in the future in 2019,The Running Man tells the story of Ben Richards(Arnold Schwarzenegger),a former cop who was framed for killing dozens of people and sent to prison but later escapes. While on the run from the law Richards is captured by the police and is put on the television show The Running Man which is hosted by Damon Killian(Richard Dawson)and is a show where he's being chased by stalkers. Now on the show as a contestant,Richards must now have to figure out how to clear his name and stay alive.The Running Man is a wonderful and Action-packed SCI-FI-Action-Thriller that was a modest success at the Box Office but the movie seems to get lost in the shuffle with other Arnold Schwarzenegger movies as the movie came out in between Action classics such as The Terminator and Terminator 2:Judgment Day,Predator,Total Recall and Commando,but I have always loved The Running Man as one of my favorite Arnold Schwarzenegger movies and in my opinion it's one of his better films. From beginning to end The Running Man is just pure and delightful entertainment that is thrilling and over the top and is one of those movies where when the Action starts it keeps going and never quits. When you mix together Action,Dystopian SCI-FI,Satirical Humor and cheesy but very memorable puns and one liners you have a great movie in my opinion. The Action is amazing and thrilling because we get gunfights,explosions and many other exciting things going on throughout the movie that will keep viewers entertained and on the edge of their seats. The Satirical Humor of the movie works so well because the movie is mocking game shows,television and the media where everything is outlandish and turned on it's head. Ben Richards is a terrific character in the typical Arnold Schwarzenegger mold:he's very tough,confident and can handle himself against all odds while spitting out one-liners and kicking butt at the same time. When he's in The Running Man game he faces off with the stalkers well using his strength and brains to outsmart the stalkers and we the audience root for him to survive. Damian Killain is the opposite because as soon as we see him we hate his guts because as the host of The Running Man all he cares about is television ratings no matter who lives or dies. And while he doesn't kill anyone he's probably the most vicious character in the movie and you want to see Killian go down. I love movies that are set in a dark Dystopian future and The Running Man has always been one of my favorites movies set in a dark future because in The Running Man the United States in the future is a police state where schools are shut down,freedom is nonexistent and the media tells you what they want you to hear and where the economy and society have truly fallen apart. Even though the film is silly and over the top The Running Man is pretty relevant as the movie gave viewers a foreshadow to what would be known as reality television but in the world of The Running Man reality television is taken to such a violent extreme where the game is death and the prize is life. The themes and issues addressed in The Running Man make the movie rise above the typical Action movie and give the film some substance. Some Stephen King fans will be disappointed that the movie isn't really faithful to the original book but as a Stephen King fan myself I can see the movie and book as two different but great things that both can be enjoyed. The ending of The Running Man is amazing,fun and filled with Action and surprises that truly hits the spot. An outstanding ending.The cast is great. Arnold Schwarzenegger is excellent and at his best as Ben Richards,with Schwarzenegger,being charismatic,kicking butt and saying great one-liners. Richard Dawson is fantastic as Damon Killain,the sadistic game show host of The Running Man. Maria Conchita Alozno is terrific,beautiful and sexy as Amber,a woman who helps Ben. Yaphet Kotto and Marvin J. Mcintyre are great as Laughlin and Weiss,two members of a resistance. Mick Fleetwood gives a fine performance as Mic,the leader of the resistance. Jesse Ventura(Captain Freedom),Jim Brown(Fireball),Gus Rethwisch(Buzzsaw),Erland Van Lidth De Jeude(Dynamo)and Toru Tanaka(Subzero)are fun and menacing as The Running Man stalkers. Dweezil Zappa(Stevie),Kurt Fuller(Tony)and Sven-Ole Thorsen(Sven)give good performances as well.The direction by Paul Michael Glaser(of Starsky & Hutch fame)is wonderful,with Glaser always moving the camera and bringing an energy,style and pace to the film. Fine direction,Glaser.The score by Harold Faltermeyer is great,memorable and matches the tone and energy of the movie. Amazing score,Faltermeyer. There is also the memorable song called Restless Heart(Running Away With You)by John Parr.In Final Word,if you love Arnold Schwarzenegger,SCI-FI films or Action-Thrillers,I highly suggest you see The Running Man,a terrific and entertaining SCI-FI/Action/Thriller that is Arnold Schwarzenegger at his best. Highly Recommended. 10/10.",The Running Man

120,squirrel_burst,"Before ""The Hunger Games""... before ""Gladiator""... before ""Battle Royale""... there was...",8,6 January 2015,"People are always going to remember Arnold Schwarzenegger's classic movies, like ""The Terminator"" franchise, ""Total Recall"", ""Predator"". ""Pumping Iron"", ""Conan the Barbarian"" and some of his comedies might make up some of your favourites too. When you're making your rounds through this Adonis of action's films though, don't forget to check out ""The Running Man"". It's a campy, spot-on satire of reality-TV programming and pro-wrestling, with some gladiatorial-style death thrown in for good measure. It has colourful characters that are memorable (particularly the stalkers, Maria Alonso and Richard Dawson) and some good one-liners too. We've seen this type of movie a lot nowadays, where an unwilling participant in a fight to the death has to kill, kill kill! His way to the top in order to right a wrong, but I don't think I've ever seen a movie that pulls it off in a way that's as fun as this movie since ""Death Race 2000"". Yeah we've seen children butchering each other as a thrilling, thought-provoking movie, but sometimes you just want to see a guy on hockey skates go after a beefy action hero and try to kill him with his razor-sharp hockey stick. It's unfortunate that Arnold Schwarzenegger's performance isn't great, but the actor that really shines in this film is Richard Dawson as the host of ""The Running Man"" and a terrific, memorable villain. This movie is fun, pure and simple. (On Blu-ray, July 14, 2012)",The Running Man

Watching it today, I believe some network executive is going to put this on television in the near future.  This movie is less science fiction than science fact.  Of course we the people would watch such a show where convicted felons get a chance at freedom or die trying.  This is truly a classic film underappreciated when it was first released.

Originally, THE RUNNING MAN started life as a book written by Richard Bachman (AKA: Stephen King). The story is pretty straightforward: In the near future, criminals are given the opportunity to win back their freedom. But only if they participate and survive in the televised game show THE RUNNING MAN. To date, no-one has made it. But all that might change when Ben Richards (Arnold Schwarzenegger in one of his best roles ever) enters the arena. All to the chagrin of game show host Damon Killian (Richard Dawson in a slightly more sadistic version of his FAMILY FEUD persona), who tries increasingly desperate tactics to kill Richards and his pals.

123,gabriel_sanchez,"OK for that time, but it got old",4,6 April 2021,"When you see The Running Man (1987), you notice that it screams ""late 80's"" all over itself. With a modest but high budget, it tries to couple familiar faces and everything they deemed awesome from that era.The Running Man (1987) is very loosely based on Stephen King's novel with the same name. ""Very"" even should be fully capitalized. The Running Man (1987) probably only borrows the names, the setting, and the overall idea.In this film, Ben Richards, now an athletic man, needs to complete The Running Man game for a chance of survival. The Running Man game from the novel is more interesting to me. In the novel, the game is set in the whole world. You can do anything to survive, as long as you follow some rules. In the film, the game is like a series of goofy WWE fights.Don't get me wrong here. I'm not trying to compare this movie with the novel. I'm just stating the fact that the producers had better material to work with.Queue the 80's corny music too. You are in for a treat.With the best plank-acting, a lot of flashy visuals and clothing, and your fair share of punch lines, The Running Man (1987) is your dismissable action-comedy.

124,TheHande,It's Schwarzenegger!,6,6 December 2005,"""The Running Man"" stands out from most neo-futuristic neo-scifi b-movies by actually having some a-level scenes. Creating believable future-societies for the silver-screen is difficult if not impossible. The movie touches upon a surprisingly contemporary subject, reality television. Unfortunately parts of the movie are perhaps less than believable and that's really the biggest hinderer of the viewing experience.The ending however is surprisingly satisfying, the technology isn't too quirky (except for ""the Stalkers"") and the soundtrack was nice. The movie also gives us some of the good things of the 80s (this is one of the few b-movies that tries to be sexy and succeeds). Certain pop-culture reference were a bit too much but luckily take very little screen-time. The death of Buzz-saw, however, seems to blow flat the movie's apparent theme of sadism. Either way, this is pure 100% Schwarzenegger.Even with it's quirks, definitely watchable.",The Running Man
125,Mr_Censored,"""The Running Man"" is also a thinking man.",7,14 July 2009,"""I'm not into politics; I'm into survival."" - Ben Richards It's rather funny – well, scary – how ahead of its time ""The Running Man"" was when it came out 22 years ago. Since its release, reality TV has become the norm, as audiences tune in week by week to watch people humiliating and sometimes endangering themselves for a payday. In the film, it's convicts and the outcasts of society who are thrust into the game, given a chance to earn their freedom that almost always ends in death. A bit skewed from the reality-TV of today, but as our culture progresses, it can't help but feel like this is what we are building towards. The film seems to stumble upon these themes by accident, though, inadvertently becoming relevant to today's times.At its core, ""The Running Man"" is less of a socially conscious techno-thriller and more of a prototypical 80's Arnold Schwarzenegger vehicle. All the trademarks are there -- from the one-liners and puns to the over-the-top action and stunts-- to make it an Arnie classic. Everyone's favorite Austrian is in top form, and is matched by the lovely Maria Conchita Alonso as a love-interest who is thrust into the game when she makes enemies with the government. Arnie's ""Predator"" co-star and also-future-politician Jesse Ventura has a bit part as one of the bad guys and hams it up appropriately and while it's nice to see Yaphet Kotto in another sci-fi classic, he isn't given much to do. The direction by Paul Michael Glaser is adequate and captures the zany action nicely, but the film can't help but look and feel dated, especially when it comes to wardrobe choices and the music in the film. This can be forgiven, though, as many 80's flicks have fallen victim to the same things.Even though the imagery and technology within the movie doesn't exactly resemble the future we are living in today, its themes sure do, and that's what makes ""The Running Man"" worth coming back to time and time again. It's more intelligent than the average bear, and aside from having Arnie in his prime, has enough social commentary to stimulate the brain and keep it feeling fresh. Hopefully reality-TV doesn't go this far South, but if it does, Arnold Scwarzenegger and company will be there to say ""I told you so."" As for me, I'm betting on a remake sometime in the next few years.",The Running Man
126,monkeysgalore,A Biting Social Satire and Visceral and Entertaining Dystopian Action Flick,8,23 April 2020,"What a great movie. Arnold knows that most people go into these kinds of movies to be entertained, and he always entertains the crap out of the audience. The Running Man is no acceptation.Paul Michael Glaser seems a gifted director. He shows a natural talent at directing action scenes, and fully utilizing Arnold's talents. The sets and filming are both great, and the movie is very atmospheric. The movie is not only a violent action movie, but a biting satire on the media and sensationalism, which, if a little heavy-handed and unsubtle, still works.Arnold is as solid as ever in the lead role, participating in all the action scenes and laughing with us the whole way through. This movie isn't meant to be taken super seriously, and it's so deliriously OTT and self-aware, which makes it that much more fun.This movie is jam-packed with big action scenes and set-pieces. The opening helicopter fight, and the prison fight were cool, and there's a bit of a pause to develop plot and characters here, but once the game gets underway, it's full-throttle. Lots of cool scenes include a great fight with Arnold and the chainsaw dude, several cool kills complete with cheesy one-liners, a great car crash, a brutal fight with Arnold and Jesse Ventura, and a great final shootout and villain death. It's so entertaining.I highly recommend this movie. It's vintage Arnold and a perfect example of the fun and insanity of the 80s action period. It's not very faithful to the original short story (which is great, by the way), and it's definitely less bleak and mean-spirited than the source material. But even if it's not faithful, it's still stupidly fun in its own right.",The Running Man
127,son_of_cheese_messiah,The Punning Man,4,2 December 2013,"Dreadful puns, mindless violence and 80s music (and general fashion sense) do not make for a timeless classic but the Running Man is still just about watchable due to its satirical take on what is the likely form of future or even present-day authoritarianism, in which tyranny is sold to us as convenience and entertainment.In some ways the terrible and dated 80s synth-pop music plays to an advantage in this flick, since it subtly conveys the superficial nature of such a society.But by and large the film undermines its own message throughout. It can hardly be said to be criticising a society which demands monstrous violence by showing us monstrous violence (then winking to the audience in the form of one of Arnie's punning one-liners). Nor can it be said to have honestly portrayed a state which upholds ""traditional morality"" while grey haired old grannies quite openly utter the most extreme obscenities on live TV while no one bats an eyelid.Such gimmicks as the swearing grannies appeal to the lowest common denominator, yet the film presents itself as a critique of such a lowest common denominator culture. This is Hollywood typically having its cake and eating it but I doubt whether anyone there would consider that films such as The Running Man, rather than being a warning about a future dystopia, might be helping to bring it about? That may be an over the top view of what is, after all, a silly and disposable film, although no more so than some comments make in praising its supposedly prophetic qualities. Hollywood has done what it always has, taking an interesting novel, gutted it, then stuffed in as much spectacle as it could afford.If Hollywood wants to know who the new gladiatorial ringmasters are, it should perhaps look in a mirror.",The Running Man
128,kingofdanerds,Not one of Arnold's finest,3,19 May 2021,"Stephen King is certainly well known but something that the average King reader may not know is that he wrote several books under the pseudonym of Richard Bachman. This allowed King to write non horror novels that were pretty much more violent thrillers. The Running Man is one such novel. The original novel is a great read and had the potential to be a great movie. A movie adaptation was made in 1987 and was directed by Paul Michael Glaser who played Starsky on Starsky and Hutch. The film stars Arnold Schwarzenegger (The Terminator), Richard Dawson (host of Family Feud), Maria Conchita Alonso (Predator 2), and Yaphet Kotto (Alien). The film was a commercial success (partly due to having Schwarzenegger starring in the film) and recieved mixed results from critics.It is the near future of 2017 and society has gone to hell with the United States being a totalitarian police state. Ben Richards is given the command to take out a crowd but refuses and is then framed. He escapes 18 months later and is later recaptured and put on the #1 game show The Running Man where convicted people can be pardoned for their crimes if they can survive the ""stalkers"".I will admit I was greatly disappointed by this film. First off, the film does not follow the source material whatsoever. In certain cases, that is fine I suppose but when you have a great story and then plan on adapting it, you should stick close to the source material rather than have the similarities only be the title. The Running Man is not Arnold's finest and dare I say, his first dud since gaining popularity with Conan the Barbarian. I have seen Arnold in far better films and while I don't consider him to be a great actor, I have seen what he is capable of doing when it comes to his acting. In here, he is given stupid one liners that are on the same level as his one liners in Terminator 3. The bright spot in the cast is Richard Dawson. Now, I had no clue who Richard Dawson was while watching this and I only found out after the fact and luckily before this review. It does help that Richard Dawson was the host of an actual game show. Outside of that, he does fine in his role as the host of Running Man. The rest of the cast is nothing spectacular in my opinion and what we get in terms of characters (with the exception of Richard Dawson's character) is underdeveloped characters that I just don't give a crap about. The ""stalkers"" in the film have the duty in hunting down the runners and preventing them from winning the game. The are lame and cheesy and not very threatening in the least bit. I mean Jesse Venutra is kind of cool as Captain Freedom with some of the lines he is given but he does not do much outside of that in this film. Which leads me to the action. The action is not that great which is says a lot when talking about Arnold Schwarzenegger films. The action is a cycle of this and that and fighting a Stalker here and fighting another one here. It is the same thing. The only action that deviates from this cycle is the last act in the film. People try to convince me that this film passes as a violent film and I call bull on that. This film comes nowhere close to being violent. There is maybe a total of two instances where I would say ""Yeah that is violent"". The book was really violent and seeing that this was the same year that we got RoboCop, I was hoping for something that compared to the book. If anything good that comes out of the film that I have not already said is that the soundtrack by Harold Faltermeyer (who did Beverly Hills Cop) is pretty sweet. I am always a fan of synthesizer soundtracks. I suppose the concept is quite interesting in the film. I think the idea of violent reality television where you take convicts and have them fight for their lives is interesting. Of course this is different from the novel where the main character just simply signs up for the show to get some money. But the execution is silly and I cannot help but think of The Hunger Games when watching this (concept wise that is). I understand that people deem this as satire but I simply do not get it or it is not clever enough for me to give a crap. Game shows and reality television to me are two different things. The Running Man (the show in the movie) is a reality show which happens to be a game much like today's Survivor and Big Brother. Reality television did not get big until the 2000's so had this film been released in around that time, the satire might work I guess. But with that being said, the movie trys to depict reality television at a game show time period. Also, quit with the ""oh this movie is good because it predicted things"". Even if this film did, I would not base my whole opinion of this film on the fact that it predicted certain things. Sure, it is cool when a film does that but I simply do not see what this film predicted. Simple as that.The Running Man to me was a huge let down. I would give it a lower rating but it simply does not compare to those films.",The Running Man

So really, it's about a dystopian future where Americans are a bunch of corporate whores who can't stop lying and cheating people out of things for two seconds. Arnold plays a wrongly-accused convict who has to survive a deadly game show in order to prove his innocence. And if you need me to tell you how it all turns out, you don't know how movies work.

Its agood fun 80s action flick though, with enough 80s cheese to make you forget any nostalgia you might have. The action is reasonably well done, and its well paced. A popcorn action film and ok for that.",The Running Man

136,McQualude,Silly and flat 80's sci-fi action movie but still holds a charm,6,25 April 2009,"The Running Man is very silly. They use silly sound effects, the helicopter has a jet sound effect, the M-16s have hand gun sound effects, and there were a couple more examples I laughed about but can't remember now. The plot is a ridiculous but irresistible near future dystopian society that uses gladiator games to quell the masses and take their minds from their empty bellies. I've no doubt this movie would have been long forgotten if not for some very charismatic and memorable performances by Arnold Schwarzenegger and Richard Dawson. Jesse Ventura also appears with what looks to be a very bad toupee but isn't given much to do. My biggest pet peeve with this movie is the poor editing, we jump from scene to scene at times too abruptly. It isn't as if you'll have trouble following the story, but five minutes edited back in would have given the movie much better flow. Still this is an action movie and Arnold delivers while also delivering his trademark one liners.",The Running Man
137,talllwoood13,The runs man,3,23 September 2021,"This is such a terrible movie. Almost as bad as something I saw recently that was recommended to me called ""Tango And Cash"" which starred Kurt Russel and Sylvester Stallone. Yet it's not so bad it's good.This movie seems like the fever dream of some inbred mentally challenged kid in the back yard banging his toys together so hard paint is chipping off of them spewing grown up words he heard his mom and 3rd or 4th step father utter drunk on the phone. It's like some guy who has to be nice and talk to the dirty juice stained kid because his mom is hot, questionably single and great in bed about what he'd do if he had his own tv show or movie how poorly thought out the ""stalkers"" are in the tv show. The stalkers are really poorly thought out like not even in the 80s on WCW or WWF either owner of those wrestling organizations would say those are great ideas give the wrestler the gimmick. I think even the marvel movies, DC or similar comic book style movies made today with characters everyone pretends to always have liked are better that are made today.The opening was cheesy and poorly thought out like most of the script. Though like many have said this movie did predict a lot of stuff we take for granted. Arnold's line delivery was really poor trying to be dramatic. Arnold doesn't want to kill some innocent people so the police detain him. He struggles to stay in the chopper as much as he struggles to act. Even the green screen is awful. Yes there are far worst uses of it in actual 2017 but still I'm surprised how quickly this army or whatever he is in is ready to turn on him for one questioned order. It was like in the movie ""The Room"" with Tommy Wiseau. If I had to pick a scene with similar acting skills it would be when Johnny and Mark are talking in the restaurant. Mark tries to ask Tommy how work is going and out of nowhere Tommy asks Mark about his sex life! Alright moving on!Arnold has been in prison for 16 months and his hair is surprisingly clean as are most of the inmates. He escapes too easily. Murdering people with the single shot fire rate on his assault rifle. The only thing more amazing than that would be winning against Dominic in a good (if that's possible) Fast And The Furious movie where Arnold's car is in reverse the whole time while Dominic is flooring it and driving his best or beating Michael Phelps in a swimming race while riding a gummy bear life boat . Seriously why even have a assault rifle if it's only going to shoot one bullet at a time. Why not at least a 3 shot burst fire. How much of the movies budget actually went on the movie? Woah woah woah.. 3 shots per person? No we can't afford it. Best we can do is 1! How did this movie make a profit and how dare it be released on my birthday in 1987!Why are the credits still going in key parts of the movie with little happening in it like 10 minutes in? That is insulting like not being able to skip cut scenes in video games you've played 100s of times.Though the movie can be imaginative with all the special effects. The collar around their necks reminds me of the JCVD movie Double Team from 10 years later. They kind of predicted some of the awful haircuts of todays generation as well in 2021. I wonder if this inspired the Nintendo game smash tv as it came out 3 years after this movie. I kind of like this 2017 more than the one that we actually experienced. No auto tuned cool kids talking into microphones and twerking. This 2017/2018 had heart and character!Jesse Ventura's wig in the movie looks so awful and fake. He does his best Hulk Hogan impersonation is the only highlight for him he has. The fight he has choreographed on tv is so awful. It makes WWE today look good.When they are in. Amber's house she has voice activation to make coffee, to turn on the tv to a specific channel but no security system for intruders? Of course she doesn't believe him at first but somehow near the end of the movie has this almost duty or conviction to see if Arnold was telling the truth or not to her. Of course she gets caught and is added to the game. Yet 20 minutes give or take before it was because of her that Arnold got caught. Though the actress has won awards for her beauty she has the acting ability of Fabio Lanzoni the guy on the romance novels. Of course near the end of the movie she wants to be with him because everything is so convenient in this movie like if Arnold scratched a lottery ticket, got pulled over by the police or anything it would go his way.I'm surprised Arnold would even bother saving those two inmates who I believe escaped prison with him if I remember right though I did just see the movie about an hour ago.The bad guy does a good job of trying to get us to hate him. He tries to do his best Bob Barker impersonation. What happens to him is satisfying near the end so at least there's that.Arnolds outfit looks so awful. I actually prefer the hideous Hawaiian shirt he has on. He looks like some awful marvel, DC or nascar driver with it on.I like how minimalistic the movies soundtrack was during the movie.The big issue I have with this movie is how poorly paced it is, it feels incomplete. Lots of dull spots to give us excuses to sneak out of the theater to watch something else. It's a great concept. But poorly executed for the tv show. At least it's better than the hunger games. The script is so bad for this movie I wouldn't even wipe my backside with it!Did they pick the gimmicks for the ""stalkers"" out of a hat. A hockey player who is Asian who cuts people up because oh yeah all Asian people make sushi. Then we have a fat opera singer who looks mentally disabled and had his way with a light bright or Christmas tree. Then a motorcycle driving chainsaw wielding Guy Fieri who went to steroid town instead of flavor town. The only cool one was jet pack flame throwing black guy. All of them died too easily yet are billed as ""the best"" they are home alone bad guys at best.How little blood and gore this movie has I'm surprised it got an R rating. I would have had at least a bit of nudity or something to actually make it worthwhile to keep some sweaty dads attention sneaking their kids in.Skip it, don't watch it, if you see it in a thrift shop jump on it in the parking lot. You'll get more satisfaction out of this.",The Running Man

But that does not make it a bad movie. In King's version, Schwarzenegger's character is a skinny, intense and relentless character, a person with integrity that surpasses all expectations and vigor, in a Dystopian world. In King's version, the protagonist is ""every man,"" just an average Joe who is lucky enough to be elected for the ""Running Man"" game show. He runs and runs and runs and kicks some serious a--. Unfortunately in the movie, it's all about Arnold getting revenge. But this doesn't make it a bad movie, just one that is a betrayal to the passion and the voice of the original story. In this regard, the movie is a fraud, and yet, it is enjoyable in the heyday of Arnold's magnificence.",The Running Man

My in depth movie review and retrospective of the underrated 80's sci-fi action classic, and one of my personal favorite films. As a kid I always loved this movie is the third best action movie in my opinion I love The Running Man to death, this movie was also made after success of Predator with co starring Jesse Ventura who opposite started with Schwarzenegger in Predator. Very underrated 80's sci-fi action classic, and one of my personal favorite films, I love this movie to death is my number 3 best Arnold Schwarzenegger movie.The film is very underrated and very bashed and hated from the other critics and fans. In my opinion is very great fun Science Fiction Action film about a convicts who has to fight for survival in a game show. The film, set in a dystopian America between 2017 and 2019, is about a television show called The Running Man, where convicted criminal ""runners"" must escape death at the hands of professional killers.",The Running Man
140,ray-280,The best picture of 1987,10,31 March 2006,"Didn't Mystic Pizza win the Oscar for that year? This movie never had a chance, due to the casting, but perhaps by now people can see why I felt that way upon leaving the theater. Only ""Wargames"" left me feeling similarly disturbed after leaving the theater, with the feeling I was getting a glimpse of our future. History has shown that this is exactly what happened.The casting is a pop-culture Cuisinart of the 1980s: you get Arnold as Ben Richards, the framed fugitive offered a chance to ""run"" for his freedom on the game show with the same title as the movie; Richard Dawson as Damon Killian, treating his role as if he were the host of Family Feud with the contestants using real guns; Jesse Ventura as ""Captain Freedom"" and co-wrestler Professor Tanaka as ""Subzero,"" both ""stalkers"" who kill the ""running men."" Even Mick Fleetwood (Mic) and Dweezil Zappa (Stevie) show up, while the ""dancers of the future"" are none other than the Laker Girls. This movie SCREAMS ""80s."" The plot is a good excuse for the action: Ben Richards is determined to prove his innocence, but agrees to be the Running Man when he is told that his buddies would be set free; instead, they join him as ""contestants."" Maria Conchita Alonzo as Amber Mendez is the standard by which one can properly judge Salma Hayek in the 1990s.The production value on the film was a bit poor, the lines were cheesy, and (at the time), the plot seemed a bit far-fetched. I remember thinking when I was leaving the theater that we were definitely heading in the direction of the film, but who could have seen how far we'd go there and how fast? If The Running Man were listed in TV Guide, most people would assume it were just another reality show pushing the envelope today. The government influences on the media have only gotten worse, and the dumbed-down American public of the future that surrenders all of its freedoms for ""national security"" is downright chilling. Ben Richards is played brilliantly by Arnold as one of the few remaining holdouts against a government tyranny that the rest of America is all too willing to accept in return for good television and some parting gifts for the audience.The movie was way over the top, maybe even off the cliff for its time, but as with Back to the Future III, the ""ravine"" it appeared to be sinking itself into in 1987 was replaced by completed tracks in 2006 and beyond, and this movie will sail into the future as one of the more prophetic films of our time. It is tragic that, as with Wargames, the academy did not give this brilliant screenplay the recognition it deserved. ""Serious"" actors acting seriously while being so pretentious that you want to throw up may win more Oscars, but that doesn't make them better films than their ""common man"" counterparts, such as this one.An absolute must-see.",The Running Man
141,MrVibrating,Goofy and funny 80's satire,7,27 December 2006,"This is an Arnold movie. Now that you know that, I've saved a lot of you the time it would have taken to read this review. If you don't like Arnold, then you wont like this movie. If the case is the other, then you will very probably like it. It's as simple as that.Now, if you're still reading this I expect you like Arnold. Good for you! He is quite good isn't he. The Running Man is a very typical Arnold feature. It's got the usual retro-future we know so well from 80's B-Sci Fi, it's got a bunch of terrible one-liners, lots of violence and explosions, and a good-looking heroine and a happy ending.In this case, the evil opponent is the all-controlling 1984ish government, which uses television as an effective crowd-control with gladiator-type game shows. Arnold, of course, ends up in one of these shows and turns it all up-side-down, with a little help from his two confederates and the good-looking Amber.It's not a big budget movie, but it still managed to create a pretty good atmosphere of the future, with some nice matte paintings and sets to help it. It's hopelessly 80's, but I find that charming. Acting is varying, Arnold doing his usual grunt and shout thing, with a helping of stone-faced one-liners. Heroine Amber is, to put it lightly, a bit stereotypical, and the subtly named Damen Killian is a typical evil TV man.In spite of all it's flaws, the movie shows its message very clearly; television is an opiate of the masses, a good way to control people. It also features some at the time futuristic digital video editing, allowing the bad guys to change faces in a video to fool their audience. This does not seem futuristic at all today, which is a bit alarming.If you've seen Arnold movies before then you know when to watch this one. Enjoy.",The Running Man

143,Minerva_Meybridge,Dawson Great. All Else Lacking.,2,31 March 2013,"Most people remember Richard Dawson as the host of Family Feud. But Dawson was a character actor, whose first real claim to fame was on Hogan's Heroes. But there were other roles dating back to the early Sixties, including one on the Dick Van Dyke Show in Racy Tracy Rattigan, where he played a lothario with his eye on Laura Petrie. Dawson's role as Killian gave self homage to his role on Family Feud.The rest of the acting was stilted and wooden. Years later would fine Arnold running for governor of California with more disastrous results. The direction by Paul Michael Glazer only proved that most actors should stick to acting. Production values were even less than television quality. What in 1987 was released as a sci-fi action thriller, today reflects more as a low budget comedy. I find it incredible that the same man, who wrote both Die Hard and Die Hard 2, wrote this. Guaranteed that if this had come out after DH, Arnold would have spouted yippee-ki-yay, mother f**ker as Dawson sped towards his doom.",The Running Man
144,charlessmith702210,"Slightly better than Rollerball, and possibly more exciting too",8,7 April 2007,"It is a flick that teaches new words. Words like sonic deadlines, deltoid IM injection, Zen speech, and the Bakersfield Massacre. But more than that, this movie also has shades of Rollerball. Both movies depict how large audiences are often uplifted by gory violence and death for entertainment reasons. Part of this led to the violent TV sports shows like the World Wrestling Entertainment and Ultimate Fighting.The prisoner-restraint collar during the detention center scene was perhaps the most shocking scene ever in the movie. I also found out that Wilshire, the name of the detention center, was not fictional, because in Los Angeles, there is a Wilshire Park and a Wilshire Center.It was hard to figure out what those unusual collars had been related to for the sonic deadline perimeter in the detention center...I had to wait until near the end of the scene. So here it is:The detention center security guards had retrofitted all of those Wilshire prisoners with prisoner restraint collars on their necks. The most brutal purpose of the collars was to keep the prisoners from escaping. Anyone who escapes through the ""sonic deadline perimeter"" would trigger the guards to arm the collars with an explosive charge in the collars which would blow up the collar in about 20 seconds unless someone was there to stop it. This is where prisoner Weiss comes in. He has to crack the code that lower the sonic deadline (hence the term ""perimeter deactivated"") so that the restraint collars would be disarmed. Weiss almost ends up in trouble with the guards as he tries to remember the access code the guard typed in the computer that lowers the sonic deadline. Without nothing to stop it, once that collar explodes, the prisoner dies instantly. But of course, the most gory result occurs when prisoner Chico, trying to go past the sonic deadline during the prisoner revolt and escape, has his head blown away by the collar.Finally, Weiss deactivates the perimeter permanently after several tries when all the guards were killed. It was a great relief to see the prisoners see freedom, but feeling sorry for Chico who had his head blown. I am glad that no prison system in the world has restraint collars that explode. The only thing close was electronic monitoring, now used for those on probation or on house arrest.And the game show itself was exciting. Especially Buzzsaw's confrontation with Ben Richards (played by Schwarzenegger), when Ben gets tied to the rope of Buzzsaw, and goes along with him on two rough rides...but you also see the strong point in Ben, where he uses the rope to take out Buzzsaw and his bike. And I also like the ""test of strength"" fight between Ben and Buzzsaw, which ends with Ben killing off Buzzsaw. With Ben's kill, you think that he should be acting as a stalker---not a runner contestant.Finally, I like the made-up tape on the Bakersfield massacre that was part of the game show. This reminds me also on Schwarzenegger in Terminator 2---where he is told by Edward Furlong not to kill people anymore, because at the beginning of Running Man, he says during the helicopter scene near Bakersfield that he is not going to execute people. In the Running Man, therefore, he only kills if he himself is in danger.",The Running Man
145,Guardia,"""Running"" on empty...",6,19 January 2005,"It's very different to the novella by Stephen King, and you will be disappointed if you like the subtlety of the book. This movie has Arnold Schwarzenegger forced to play ""The Running Man"" TV show, and he runs around in an abandoned part of the city with his buddies dealing with the show's killers i.e. Sub-zero, Buzz-saw, Dynamo, Fireball etc.The premise is fairly good, but the movie is let down mainly by it's average screenplay. It's sub-plot is quite tedious, and the action is fairly predictable and not very believable, (in context of others in this genre).There are some interesting moments when the film touches on future social systems; jails, advertisements, careers. But these are short-lived and left by the way-side when the action (slowly) begins. At most points, it is more action than science-fiction.Arnold Schwarzenegger's presence is quite good, and his typical violence and resourcefulness come across as well as any other film he is in - it's only that the too-neat plot and poor dramatic structure let it down.",The Running Man
146,acdc_mp3,My favorite adaptation of a Stephen King story,10,28 June 2020,"I was extremely dubious about this movie based on it's trailers when it was initially released. I passed on watching it because I am such a huge fan of the story, I didn't want to see it mangled by Hollywood. I finally watched it when I stumbled across it on TV and while the the movie is completely different than the story on many levels, the heart of it comes through greatly.What I really liked about this movie was the humor I was not expecting and the absolutely great job of Richard Dawson as the obnoxious game show host. I also enjoyed the comic book quality of the chasers. Last but not least, I loved the fact that they did not soften the violence to appease to younger crowds.The beauty of this movie is you did not need to read the story to enjoy the movie to its fullest. We aren't talking ""The Godfather"" here, but this is a great popcorn movie to just sit and enjoy while leaving your worries behind.",The Running Man
147,TimBoHannon,A Unique and Satisfying Adventure,7,19 December 2007,"The premise is simple. Criminals, under the possibility of a pardon, can participate in ""The Running Man."" Staged as a game show, they must traverse 400 deserted square blocks three hours. The catch is that they are being pursued by specialized hit men called stalkers. If they are found, ""Anything goes!"" There are four stalkers: Buzzsaw (Gus Rethwisch), Dynamo (Erland van Lidth), Fireball (Jim Brown) and Professor SubZero (Professor Toru Tanaka). All hosted by Damon Killian (real life game show host Richard Dawson), ""The Running Man"" rules the industry. While the film may not be a cultural sensation, it works. It definitely works.Arnold Schwarzenegger plays Ben Richards, a military pilot who is arrested after refusing to fire on unarmed food rioters. Next, the government publicly blames him for the ensuing massacre. After escaping with the help of two resistance soldiers (Marvin J. McIntyre and former Bond villain Yapet Kotto), he catches Killian's attention. Upon recapture, Killian blackmails him into appearing on the show, then double-crosses Richards by putting his two friends in with him.""Running Man"" is not saturated with fights, guns and gore like most Schwarzenegger films. Action does not occur in customary lighting. The labor prison Richards is in has a dry, dusty atmosphere. The gaming zone is lit from faint, multi-colored lamps under the night sky. The indoor places are either dark or drenched in a powerful colored light. All of it provides a distinct visual atmosphere. Director Paul Michael Glaser sets the mood with the abnormal lighting, but at times it interferes with the action by making it tougher to discern detail. For example, the decisive showdown with Buzzsaw is bathed with red light, obscuring both his face and the mean fountain of blood as he finds his name most appropriate. With delivery hampered somewhat, the film must rely on other strengths.It works because the stalkers work, and because Dawson works. When I saw him so far down the cast list, I believed his role to be small. It is not. After Schwarzenegger, Dawson probably has the greatest number of lines. Dawson is wholly comfortable playing character with his real life job. Imagine Alex Trebek playing the host of a trivia show. Killian is an obsessive, lying sleaze-ball, but aside from the off-the-air scenes, Dawson hardly needs to act. Killian's flamboyance energizes the film during its slow parts. I liked his primadonna attitude, like the time he rests his feet on the desk while talking to the justice department after Richards ended the first stalker's life. His attendant dutifully modifies makeup all the while, and he scornfully tells the man on the other end that the populace will not be placated with Gilligan's Island reruns.As Richards cuts station payroll, Killian's frustration escalates. The first two times a stalker dies, the audience reacts in shocked silence and grief. By the time Richards takes out the fourth, they are betting on him and cheer as another stalker falls victim to his own specialty. The stalkers themselves are the real joy. The action may not be great by itself, but the novelty of the stalkers and the wonder of how and unarmed man can defeat them compensates ably. Each one has his own grandiose introduction, and I would not dream of spoiling them.The cast consists of a number of odd choices: Jesse Ventura, a professional wrestler, Tanaka, an unbelievably burly wrestler and actor, Jim Brown, for several years the NFL's all-time leading rusher, van Lidth, a computer company founder and opera singer, Mick Fleetwood, a rock and roll legend looking far older than his actual age, Sven Thorsen, another bodybuilder, and Rethwisch, who I think was a powerlifter. None of these roles demand great acting, so the unorthodox choices are all right. The premise is unusual, but able to support itself. Even when the focus shifts, it fits into the overall plan and leads to the perfect ending. As John Parr's awesome credits song fades away, ""The Running Man"" stands as one of Arnold's more enjoyable films.",The Running Man

It's overall a serviceable movie with some great moments.Richard Dawson is a highlight for sure as he was born to be a gameshow host. He is fun to watch and just see how exuberant he is while also being the biggest scum bag.The movie has a great start, but once Arnold starts the game show, it's where the movie severely become lackluster. The action scenes with him fighting the baddies of the show aren't anything special. They kind of feel like action from scenes really bad 70's television show. They're serviceable, but nothing like his best works. The director is the actor who played Starsky from Starsky and Hutch. He's a serviceable director, but for a movie made in 87, it sure as hell feels like it's from the mid 70's.Overall it's just an average Arnie movie.

152,DaRick89,A forgotten gem of a movie,8,10 January 2006,"I saw this movie a couple of weeks ago. I had never previously heard of this movie, despite it starring Arnold Schwarzenegger. Nevertheless, like Last Action Hero, it proves itself to a hidden gem of a movie.The movie takes place in the year 2014 (I think), apparently based on a novel by Stephen King. It's plot centres around Ben Richards, a cop who got framed by his colleagues for initiating 'The Bakersfield Massacre' when, in fact, he defied his superiors' orders by refusing to kill innocent people. Richards then gets sent to this show 'The Running Man', operated by the Department of Justice. The bloodthirsty audience bets on which 'runner' (criminal) is going to get killed by which 'stalker' (killers who are charged with 'serving justice'). The whole thing is presided over by Killian (Richard Dawson, from Hogan's Heroes). Richards says to him: ""I'll be back."" Killian replies with: ""Only in re-runs."" My first thought was, only in re-runs? I don't think so.The most interesting part of the movie is the casting. It is often bizarre; some of it works, some of it doesn't. The wrestler and the opera singer ham it up and deliver good turns, while the hockey player makes himself intentionally unlikeable. Dawson is well-cast as Killian. He is as sleazy and provocative as he was in Hogan's Heroes, as he should be.However, The Running Man does have flaws. It fells unduly 80's-ish due to the recurring background music. The ending is also rushed and as such, somewhat unfulfilling.One thing, for me anyway, The Running Man makes you do well is take the side of Richards and despise the frenzied crowds watching the Running Man. This is in contrast to The Aviator, where Di Caprio is too arrogant for us to really care about his problems. Schwarzenegger also has his sometimes lame, but always catchy one-liners going: ""Need a light?"" and ""What a hothead!"".'The Running Man' is a forgotten gem of a movie; as such, there is no reason why you should not be seeing it, even if you aren't as big a fan of Arnold Schwarzenegger as I am (due to Terminator 2, for my money, one of the best movies ever). Even if you are intolerant of the 80's-feel, it is still well worth seeing.4/5 stars",The Running Man

The great freedoms of the United States are no longer, as the once great nation has sealed off its borders and become a militarized police state, censoring all film, art, literature, and communications. Even so, a small resistance force led by two revolutionaries (Mick Fleetwood and Dweezil Zappa) manages to fight the oppression. With full control over the media, the government attempts to quell the nation's yearning for freedom by broadcasting a number of game shows on which convicted criminals fight for their lives. The most popular and sadistic of these programs is ""The Running Man,"" hosted by Damon Killian (Richard Dawson). When a peaceful protest of starving citizens gathers in Bakersfield, California, a police officer named Ben Richards ('Arnold Schwartzenegger' ) is ordered to fire on the crowd, which he refuses to do. Subdued by the other officers, the attack is carried out, and Richards is framed for the murder of almost a hundred unarmed civilians. Following a daring jail break months later, Richards is captured once again and forced to appear on ""The Running Man"" with three other convicts (Yaphet Kotto, Marvin J.

With their help, he fights his way through a cadre of sadistic gladiators hunting them down through the ruins of a Los Angeles earthquake, but not promising Killian that he'll return to settle the score when the show's host double-crosses him. In the meantime, the contestants must search through the ruins for the resistance in the hopes of finally broadcasting the truth about the government.""This is a definite 80's Action-Adventure movie as it has cheesy music on the soundtrack,more one-liners than you can shake Arnie out and a completely preposterous storyline that has holes in it that you can drive a truck through. And yet, despite all that, you enjoy the film as an up to 120 minutes where you can just sit and watch something non too taxing. The fact that it has a great premise behind it that could easily be looked at again; has elements of both an old French movie called ""Le Prix du danger"" and a novel written by the Master of Macabre, Stephen King under his pseudonym Richard Bachman. You then add in a true 80's feel. Arnie is his usual self, tough but humorous (and sometimes hard to decipher), the female has all the elements that are needed in the role given to her and both Weiss the geeky Intellect who is willing to sacrifice himself to help the Revolution and Laughlin the tough Black man who both help Arnie as he plays ""The Running Man!""",The Running Man
154,maxyg18,Silly but fun,7,24 October 2006,"THE RUNNING MAN is very different to the Stephen King book (who wrote in the name of Richard Barchman) but it's still not a bad film. It's set in the year 2017 A.D. where a man named Ben Richards (Arnold Shwarzenegger) framed for a brutal city massacre escapes from prison. However, a few days after his escape, he's caught and must star in America's most popular game show, 'The Running Man' where a contestant must try to defeat the killers that are hunting them. But no contestant has ever survived, but Ben Richards has yet to play.THE RUNNING MAN also has a message on how the media can lie to the public.It's a silly film with a few holes in its storyline but it's a fun ride.",The Running Man
155,wierzbowskisteedman,"""What a hot-head!""",9,30 September 2004,"Mild SpoilersIn the near future, Arnold stars as Ben Richards, a wrongly convicted man coerced into playing 'The Running Man', a deadly TV game show where people have to keep moving to try and escape brutal deaths at the hands of the 'Stalkers'. Of course, people are expected to die eventually and its up to Arnold to prove the system wrong.I haven't read the Stephen King book, but this is a great film regardless, one of Arnold's best. He does what he does best in the action man role, delivering death with unforgettable one-liners. Classics are probably the 'He was a real pain in the neck' after strangling a guy with barb wire, and 'He had to split!', referring to whereabouts he just chain sawed someone vertically. Dawson is perfectly irritating as the TV presenter, and all the 'Stalkers' are suitably camp. The action is violent, but its an action film. That's the point. The film is fast paced, and at 90 minutes it doesn't overstay its welcome. With Starsky and Hutch's Paul Michael Glaser at the helm, and made in the wake of the success of The Terminator, previously this film was probably seen as just another mindless action vehicle for Arnold, and very far fetched. But today, anyone who watches a lot of TV could see how the film is getting closer to reality. I wouldn't be surprised if I turn on the TV in the 'near future' and see a show not to far from this.On that depressing note, I must however recommend 'The Running Man' to anyone who likes the 80s, Arnold, ridiculous acts or violence or just a good action film. 9. 5 / 10",The Running Man
156,merem1,review,8,29 April 2017,"Good fun from the 1980's. Schwarzenegger is the best action man. He kicks ass in every film. The film had a interesting plot about a Television Game Show that involves survival against a gang of psychotic killers. The villains are memorable. The good guys in the film are well crafted, I cared about the characters. The soundtrack of the film is awesome. That ending song Restless Heart is one of my all favourite songs. The action scenes in The Running Man are fun and entertaining to watch. I recommend this to anyone who enjoys films like this.",The Running Man
157,The Bronson Fan,Without a doubt one of Arnolds top five films.,10,17 November 2006,"Arnold once again in the 80's demonstrated that he was the king of action and one liners in this futuristic film about a violent game show that no contestant survives. But as the tag line says Arnold has yet to play! The movie begins in the year 2019 in which the world economy has collapsed with food and other important materials in short supply and a totalitarian state has arisen, controlling every aspect of life through TV and a police state. It's most popular game show is The Running Man, in which criminals are forced to survive against ""Stalkers"" that live to kill them.The movie opens with Ben Richards (Arnold) leading a helicopter mission to observe a food riot in progress. He is ordered by his superiors to fire on them, refusing to gets him knocked out and thrown in prison, in the meantime they slaughtered the people without his help. The government blames Richards for the massacre earning him the name ""Butcher of Bakersfield"". Eighteen months later Richards along with two friends William Laughlin (Koto) and Harold Weiss (McIntyre) breakout of a detention zone they worked in. They make their way to the underground, led by Mic (Mick Fleetwood). Mic quickly identifies Richards as the ""Butcher of Bakersfield"" and refuses to help him, but his friend's convince him otherwise. They want him to join the resistance, but he'd rather go live with his brother and get a job. Soon he finds that his brother has been taken away for reeducation and a woman name Amber Mendez (Alonso) has taken his apartment. Knowing who he is she won't help him, but he convinces her, but is busted at the airport by the cops after she ratted him out.Meantime, The Running man is having trouble finding good new blood for the there stalkers to kill. Damon Killian (Dawson) the shows host and one of the most powerful men in the country sees Richards escape footage and is able to get him for the show after his capture. Richards refuses to play, Killian threatens to use his friends instead of him, so he signs the contract. You'll love that part. But soon he finds they will join him as well and makes sure Killian knows he'll be back. The Runners begin to make there way through the Zones and fight characters that are memorable, Sub-Zero, Buzz Saw and many others. Eventually Richards is joined by Amber who suspected he was set up but was caught and thrown into the game too. Together they find the underground and make there way back to Killian and give him a farewell send off.The running man is another one of Arnold's great movies from the 80's. The movie was apparently somewhat based on Stephen King's book of the same name. Some have said that the book is better. I'm sure it's not and I don't care anyway I loved the movie. As in all of Arnold's films the acting is what you would expect with classic one liners from Arnold and even Ventura gets a couple in. But without a doubt Richard Dawson is the standout in this film. Being a real game show host he easily spoofed himself and was able to create a character that was truly cold blooded. The whole movie itself somewhat rips on game shows and big brother watching you. Keep an eye out for them poking fun and some old shows, ""hate boat"" among others. Also the cast was great besides Arnold, Koto, and Alonzo don't forget Professor Toru Tanaka, Jim Brown, Ventura and Sven-Ole! With all the reality TV nonsense that goes on it almost fits in better now, but I'm sure the Hollywood liberals would make it into a movie about the ""Evil Bush"". The new DVD had mostly poor extras meet the stalkers being the only redeemable one. Some how the ACLU managed to get some of there communism into the DVD and is laughable garbage that should not be anywhere near an Arnold movie of all things. Blasphemy! Overall for any Arnold fan especially we who grew up in the 80's on him ,you can't miss this. Its one of the first ones I saw back in the 80's and it's still great to this day. The futuristic world and humor are great. Overall 10 out 10 stars, definitely one of his best.",The Running Man
158,goreilly40,A compelling story in its own right,8,29 August 2015,"This movie proves the point that just because a movie is different from the book its based on, doesn't mean its bad, and having read the book I believe that both stories although different, are equally compelling. Arnold is on top form here as the wronged and vengeful Ben Richards, in fact you could argue that he is an antagonist turned protagonist because at the beginning he was a government soldier in a totalitarian state who comes to realize that he was playing for the wrong team and ultimately joins the rebels. The game-show element of the movie was a clever aspect and was almost believable and as such Richard Dawson played the part of host Damon Killian very well. The other antagonists,and by that I mean the stalkers, were a bit too cliché and in the end were just your standard villains and no more than that. The other characters were played well, Maria Conchita Alonso turns in a good performance as Amber who like Richards is initially employed by the bad guys but comes the same realization, the two sidekicks, Laughan and Wiess likewise are played very well. The ending although intended to be an upbeat one, I couldn't help but think it had an ominous touch to it, I mean what would happen to Ben and Amber after they kiss and walk off and the camera's stop rolling? Surely a government as ruthless as the one in the movie would have both of them publicly executed or imprisoned as an example to other would be rebels. To conclude although this movie is very different from the novel its based on, it stands alone as a story in its own right.",The Running Man

160,JohnBoyRoy,"To be taken once a year, with a pinch of salt",7,6 April 2004,"The Running Man is one of those films that if overwatched, would become boring and depressing even.My advice is to watch it maybe once or twice a year with a couple of mates and a few drinks.In todays climate of TV Media domination and the capitalist mode in society it really does work as a revisionist social commentary, post 1980s-boom. Forget that though!  There are other brilliant and better reasons to watch this film.Schwarzenegger is on top form as Ben ""The Butcher of Bakersfield"" Richards, and the inclusion of Bond-belting one liners was completely inspired-thety are truly leg-end-dary (with his rant to Killian over a camera the main highlight).The design of the stalkers is authentically American, and mirrors the characterizations seen in the PC 'Gladiators' TV show, and the WWE as well. Buzz-saw's grisly end will chill any viewer to the core (as a foot note, why does his death stand out as particularly disturbing in what is ostensibly an upbeat actioner with a bitter sense of humour?)Jesse Venturer and Sven Ole Thorssen are great as backing muscle (and are Arnies buds in real life), and its even got Mick Fleetwood in it too! What more could you ask for?I highly recommend the Running Man if you're looking for a great piece of entertaining action, with a glossty finish and some great characters.

It isn't Total Recall or Predator, but as far as Arnie movies go, it is up there. Full of one liners, memorable set pieces and characters (although admittedly a lot of stock) this is what you would expect, but there are some flaws. Mario Alonso, for the most part, is just annoying and just becomes a women character that Arnold has to get along with.

Nice use of humor and strange casting (Dweezil Zappa?). If you're not an Arnold fan, ""The Running Man"" might be a little hard to swallow..but if you can get past the cheesiness you'll find this to be a really fast-paced, violent, funny and exciting movie. Richard Dawson almost steals the movie but Arnold, with lines like (""He had to split"" and ""Hey Christmas tree"") is still the most entertaining thing here. And hey..with Jesse 'the Body' Ventura along for the ride, how can you go wrong!

166,david_hokey_16,Arnold blames Glaser,5,24 April 2018,"When I first read that Arnold Schwarzenegger believed that part of the films failure was due to the director (he replaced the previous one after production had already begun) I found it kind of ironic. Arnold says he directed the film more like a tv show. This is somewhat true but it's part of what makes the movie work. It's centered around the airing of a live tv show after all. What brings the movie down is Schwarzenegger himself. I've never thought he was a good actor but he is suited for purely action-oriented roles in which he just does a lot of fighting and barely any talking. Unfortunately this film works on a different premise. It's an action film, yes, but also a thriller with subtext. At least it's supposed to be... we can partially blame the script as it's responsible for giving Arnold his cheesy one-liners. But Schwarzenegger takes on the same role here as he does in other films... some big muscle head who can't be stopped and whose unstoppable nature makes him act as if he's not in any actual danger. What we needed was not just your average joe... the character is a decorated officer after all... but somewhere in-between your average guy and a warrior. Someone who actually has to put in effort to fight and survive. The thrill of the 'game' is lost because we don't have this and also because we have what's supposed to be Arnold making comedy.Running Man has its good points... it's fun and stylish and has a good story underneath. But it also suffers from bad acting, poor dialogue, unrealistic 'danger', and a poorly rushed end action sequence.",The Running Man

There are some plot similarities in the two films.A good action movie, in its time, using the FX of the time.It predates ""Hunger Games"" and ""The Maze"" and others. It has the same kinds of ideas about reality TV, game shows, and corporate media.The ""Butcher of Bakersfield"" never did what they said he did.

169,belldave50,Worst Arnold Movie of the latter half of the 80's,3,18 January 2015,"Being that this is basically the forgotten Arnold film, I had to check it out. It can't be worse than Commando right? Ohhh it's worse. What I didn't realize was that Arnold was still an up and coming action star until the late 80's, early 90's when he was in Predator, Total Recall and the other infamous films of that era which exploded his popularity as an iconic celebrity, and not simply that 70's bodybuilder champion who attempted acting in some early 80's films.In this film, Arnold is acting much more and I don't fault him on any acting ability at this time. He found his own more and more and despite not having beginnings as a professional actor, his charisma has carried him alone in film. And he has improved. Hell, I thought Daniel Radcliff was horrendous in the first two HP films but improved dramatically from then on.The problem with this pile of moldy dung was that they set up this fascist future and this need for some big epic rebellion only to have it be about Arnold and his love interest surviving in some game of death that I could care less about. The effects were terrible, the one liners were painful to hear, the acting was over the top, that background synth music was one of the worst themes of the 1980's. The game show aspect of it was annoying and so on. I'm a big fan of Arnold. Even this lesser films, but this one was at the bottom of the list.",The Running Man

It was one of those movies that didn't interest me enough to see it when it was out in theatres. When I first saw it I thought it was fun and entertaining but too far fetched and too much gory violence. Its scary to watch it 32 years later and see how much has closer to home it hits now. An Alexa type system turns on TV and other appliances. The world economy has collapsed (Greece and other EU nations have faced similar economic crises in recent years) there are food shortages (Venezuela, the native country of Maria Conchita Alonso have empty grocery store shelves and unrest because of mass starvation). The U.S. government and the entertainment industry work in concert to keep the populace distracted by a savage reality TV show called The Running Man. Enemies of the state have no trial by jury they are merely turned over to the ruthless, scuzzy host of the show, played by Richard Dawson. Arnold Schwarzenegger is a member of the military who is railroaded by the State into participating on the show. (Keep in mind Reality TV wasnt even a concept until almost 15 years after this movie was made.) The Running Man is the #1 show on television with people caring more about the deadly cat and mouse game with the hunted actually being brutally killed on live TV with an enthusiastic studio audience cheering it on. (A chilling reminder of the desensitization of the culture in our current age of social media.) No interest in the constitution, freedom or human rights...free board games and household gadgets given away by Dawson to the audience is a much bigger draw. The movie even predicts millennial ignorance of classic TV (Gilligan's Island, is that the one with the boat?

As soon as I started watching I remembered why I never bothered to see this when it was new. Cheesy costumes and effects and idiotic banter abound. And with all their visions of the future, did no one involved with this film think that maybe after 40 years, 80's hairstyles would have faded away? If you think Governor Schwarzenegger is hard to understand, check out Arnold circa 1986. Incredible! And maybe they thought he would sound better if they gave him a co-star, Maria Conchita Alonso, who was also English- challenged. There are a number of scenes where the two of them are conversing, and I had no idea what either of them were saying. I can only credit the Barcalounger people for my having actually seen the whole film - I wanted to get up and shut it off, but I was too comfortable. Still, now that I've seen it all, I wish I hadn't. Seeing a respected athlete and star like Jim Brown with that ridiculous skunk hairdo made a painful experience agonizing. Throw in Jesse Ventura for some outrageously bad acting, and you've got a total loser here. Don't waste your time on this cinematic turd.",The Running Man
175,DutchECK,Not worth the title 'The Running Man',1,30 October 2004,"I am a big fan of Stephen King. I loved The Running Man. So obviously I was very excited that someone had made a film of it. And when a local network showed the film, I was in heaven. I was all ready for a night of fun!The first indicator that something was wrong was when I noticed that someone had cast Arnold Schwarzenegger. I could simply not believe that a man who got famous for films filled with runnin' an' shootin' could play a more cunning part, as was described in the book. I still was convinced that this would be a good film, however. Who knows, maybe Arnold had some hidden talents?Well, he didn't. I soon found out that the only reason he was even cast was because someone had re-written the entire story to MAKE it about fightin' an' shootin'. Yup, it was a standard Arnold-film: hero is done wrong, hero solves problems by flexing his mighty muscles and scaring everyone away and hero gets the girl.I was stunned. This is NOT what the book said at all. I know that books can't be put on screen literally, but this didn't even have ties to the book. Stephen King should have openly denounced any affiliation with the film and he should have forbidden using the title The Running Man for this shameless waste of film. I don't say it often, but this film was BAD. If I weren't at home watching, I'd have tossed rotten tomatoes at the screen. Once again: bad.(Note that I used 'someone' a lot. I did this because I'm sure a lot of people are ashamed to have worked on this and I don't want to embarrass them even further by naming them here)",The Running Man
176,resetzero,"""...this movie is a live action 80s video game"".",9,4 May 2017,"I have always loved this movie, but I'm not sure why. Firstly, this movie is ugly as hell. The entire movie is obviously shot on a sound stage, and poorly. The detail that went into set design is very lack lustre. Even as a kid, I knew this movie was ugly, and I always chalked it up to the fact it was 1987. But now that I'm older, and have taken the time to watch a lot of 80s movies, I now see that the late 80s was a very advanced time for movies. Even 1980's Blade Runner was beautifully detailed, and shot.The constant colour tone of this movie is so droning. If you could hear the colour, it would sound like a collection of low frequencies, eating away at your sanity. The lights and colours seem to overshadow the poor detail of the sets, so I wonder if thats why they went with bold lights. But at the same time as doing that, it masked whats actually happening in the movie. You can't see most of the battle scenes, because you have such an overbearing amount of red, or blue, or whatever colour ""works"" with which arena.I get the feeling this movie was severely edited for rating. There are certain parts where things seem to rush, and its not justified. One part in particular is the attempted rape scene, by Dynamo. Amber gets knocked on the ground, and all of a sudden Dynamo has his pants off. There are other parts in the movie like this, which make me wonder whether there is a harder rated directors cut somewhere.Story? What story? I know this movie has a ""story"", but its all just set up basically. In my opinion, this movie is a live action 80s video game. Because videogames of this time were exactly the same. They had stories, but they were all just for set up. The gameplay carried the games, and the stories were just for your imagination. It works for this movie though, somehow. The gameplay keeps you entertained, and the story doesn't matter. Something that I thought fell short, even in the gameplay side of it though, was the final boss. I think Arnie could've killed Killian a lot better.All in all, this movie is great. Maybe for nostalgic reasons, maybe because I like bad movies, but for some reason, I like it.",The Running Man

179,manitou-full-moon,"Cheesy, prophetic, and classic!",10,23 October 2005,"The Running Man is often dismissed as being just another Arnie action thriller full of explosions, bad puns and gunfire, and to be fair, there is a lot of that in it. People used to look at it and compare it to the Terminator series, saying it was one of the poorer Schwarzenegger films.But, give it 18 years, and you find yourself being able to appreciate it in a different light. Rather than just being another brainless action film, it works very well as a parody of reality TV. It is quite different to the Stephen King book, true, but I doubt whether Hollywood, with its love of upbeat endings and so-called 'ordinary guys' who turned out to have the skills of a trained commando, would have accepted it in its current form.But, on with the review.Ben Richards (Arnold Schwarzenegger) is a cop working in a dystopian United States where democracy is a thing of the past, and the entire country is ruled by a government/media conglomerate amalgamation. The economy is in tatters, food is scarce and the state keeps people distracted by producing sadistic gameshows for them to watch, like Jumping for Dollars, where people jump for money over a pit of rabid dogs, and the most popular one is The Running Man, a gameshow hosted by the slimy Damian Killian (played by the entertaining Richard Dawson) where supposed 'criminals' are hunted down by theatrical, pro-wresting-esquire 'stalkers'.Some, however, try and speak up against the government. When a group of hungry people hold a protest in the town of Bakersfield, California, a helicopter piloted by Richards is sent to 'calm' (i.e. kill) the protest. When Richards refuses to fire on innocent people, he is arrested and framed for the murder of the people in the crowd. He is sentenced to a slave labour camp, but escapes with the aid of a resistance leader (Yaphet Kotto) and goes on the run.However, his freedom does not last long, and after he kidnaps network employee Amber Mendez (Marita Conchita Alonso) in an attempt to escape those pursuing him, he finds himself taken prisoner again, but this time he is forced to appear on The Running Man.And there, of course, the entire film kicks into standard Arnie mode. Richards is launched into the post-apocalyptic wasteland of Los Angeles (why is LA always destroyed in these dystopian worlds?) and forced to run from the 'stalkers', along with two other prisoners who escaped from the labour camp with him. Amber also becomes curious about Richards' protestations of innocence, and discovers he was framed. Guess what happens to her, then? So, as Amber, Richards and the two other guys run around trying to avoid the stalkers, we soon become aware that Richards is no ordinary cop. He's Super Arnie, the unkillable one man army who can collapse evil corporate dictatorships and fight obese men covered in Christmas lights all while being just your average American guy with an Austrian accent.Yes, the remainder of the film becomes dumb, loud, classic 80's Arnie fun. There's a lot of exciting fight sequences, the trademark dreadful puns ('He had to split' being my favourite), and the general formulaic final confrontation and happy ending. It's a lot of fun watching Killian react to it in the typical 'wholesome' gameshow host way, as well, and some of the funniest moments in the show revolve around the contrast between his interactions with the crowd as the seemingly benevolent host (watch out for the cursing old lady!) and the cold, cyncial man he is in reality who will do anything to increase ratings.If you expect a high-brow, intelligent film, you'll be disappointed. But if you want a great 80s flick, well, this is it. But the great thing about this film is it was quite prophetic.If you look at the entertainment we have today, you'll have noticed the way reality TV is going nowadays - shows featuring people willing to put themselves through anything for five minutes of fame, and producers all too willing to let them humiliate themselves on TV. It's not too far a leap to imagine that some vile TV exec out there has been trying to get the right to show people be executed live on TV. We've already had that, however, with the ghoulish al-Qaida hostage beheading videos posted on the internet. It seems that in the current climate, at least some people are perfectly fine with watching real death on their television sets.With that in mind, and coupled with the fact that everything these days appears to be a revival of the 80s, you have to be impressed by the far-sightedness of this film. Of course, we haven't reached there yet, as it's terrorists, rather than the mainstream media, who have bought us easily available programs featuring real human death, but you just have to wonder how long it is before some exec decides to see if he can find a way of pitching a show that combines people's desire for entertainment and desire to indulge their morbid curiosity...",The Running Man

It isn't even well lit, making you long for an earlier era when that was kind of a minimum.""The Running Man"" keeps hitting you over the head letting you know it's set in the future, and it's a bad future. But it never feels like anyone who knew or cared about science-fiction or action had a thing to do with it. It does feel like, some people with way more money than sense decided you didn't need to know anything about making movies to make one. And if they knew anyone with knowledge about how to make a good one, they went way out of their way not to ask them about it.It doesn't even work as a piece of lowly exploitation, unless a few shots of Maria Conchita-Alonso in form-fitting Lycra are enough to make you blush. I was stunned to recall critics of this era said Arnold Schwarzeneger was not a good actor, since his performance is the only thing that makes this tolerable to watch for even a second. Richard Dawson's attempts to portray a malevolent game-show host are something that should have been left on the cutting-room floor of ""Family Feud.""Lacking any type of momentum, the movie makes attempts to whip up emotion in the viewer, attempts which work out as ludicrously failed as everything else.Not helping anything either is the fact that fashion has moved on, and people do not usually appear covered in Lycra nowadays, as they do in ""Running Man.""

181,leforcat,A promising first 10 minutes wasted,3,2 October 2005,"The 3 stars all belong to Arnie! In 99.9% of these kind of action movies we all know that the hero will prevail and win, the only question is how, and in the way of winning lies the main quality of the film. Regretfully, there are no surprises in this one.Here the plot is simple but promising: in a near future state has taken control over everything, since the natural resources of the earth are dwindling, and it has dehumanized most of the culture in the process. A police officer (Arnold) refuses to shot unarmed civilians and is sent to hard labor, his record falsified to make him look like the brute he was actually refusing to obey. He manages to escape, gets caught, and is given possibility of ""redemption"" by starring in the biggest and only entertainment show on television, a reality show where participants have to run for their life, normally without a reasonable chance of survival.The imagination of the script and of the production designers sadly only lasts for some 10 minutes, till the end of the prison escape. The rest is standard action completely spoiled by the pretentious. disturbing 80ish synthesizer score. Arnold manages to do his part with honor and some great one-liners but the rest of the cast is too weak to balance him and the fight sequences are predictable.The film must be given credit for inventing reality TV before it was really popular for real, but that aside it's only for Arnold and/or wrestling fans (several wrestling stars in the cast)",The Running Man
182,kingdaviduk,Relevant as ever,9,24 June 2019,"This was made in 1987, so it still has a very 80s feel to it. Which I enjoyed, although it is set in the start in 2017. Then it moves 18 months ahead, so possibly early 2019, which is fitting as I watched it in June 2019.
The world did not quite turn out as the film predicted in 2019, but some aspects of it are very relevant.
The whole concept is that criminals get a ""chance"" to escape and live a life of luxury somewhere, if they can outwit various killers, called ""stalkers"".
But it is all for TV, a TV show that lives for high ratings, a reality show that shows only what the producers want you to see. They even lie about the contestants to make them out to be criminals when they are not, as in the case of Ben Richards, who was framed for mass murder.
Near the end, Killian (great name for a TV game show host who presents death as entertainment) tries to justify it all, saying how TV shapes people's lives, as if it made their lives better. But the main message is that they are lying to you, just as governments lie, and the elite lie to us.
A must see if your mind is open to what could really be going on in the world. One day TV reality shows could well be like the Running Man. I hope not.
The 80s computers look dated. However, near the end, they edit a video to map the face of Ben Richards (Arnie) onto the face of a stunt double, to make it look like he was finally defeated. Today, TV and film really can do that, but it was impossible in 1987, so they predicted that correctly.
I highly recommend this, unless you are squeamish, as there is some violence and a little swearing.",The Running Man

In the original novella, the whole point was that there was this average, everyday Joe, forced by circumstance to compete in the ultimate of game shows, and BECAUSE he was average and everyday, he relied on brains more than brawn to solve his situations. While Schwarzenegger's performance was intelligent and cerebral in that same vein, his appearance and reputation make the viewer think, ""He's smart, but if he has to, he can and will kick butt.""

(Spoiler)Even while we are enjoying Arnold defeating the high tech gladiators with lines of ""How about a light?"", ""He had to split"", etc., this movie has a great message about how the media can influence our decision and judgment. The speech given by Damon Killian at the end of movie, about how the audience craves violence, is so true.As for what some users say about how there are no entertaining fight scenes, give it up. That fight with Buzzaw was entertaining! So was the escape from the prison at the beginning. How can anyone say this is another typical Arnold movie with lots of action but little else. In Raw Deal, maybe, but not in this. One final thing, I've just finished reading the Steven King novel that this movie was based on.

The story is almost completely different aside from the character names (Richards and Killian) and the fact that it's a futuristic television show. Everything else was pretty much made up by De Souza.Not one of Schwarzenegger's best films, but somewhat entertaining, even through his dry performance. The highlight was Richard Dawson (of Family Feud fame). He played Killian perfectly.I felt the story lacked what the book had. I didn't really care if Richards (Schwarzenegger) lived or died.

The pacing and flow were poor and I found myself bored many times...well, pretty much the entire time. The acting stank worse than a skunk that has been run over by a sauerkraut truck. What passed for effects were very, very cheesy and the writing was quite frankly offensive to any sort of sensibilities.There are a very few good spots in this movie.

190,leifthor-1,Prophetic... scary prophetic only now *spoiler alert,8,12 February 2015,"What rating do you give a film with synthesizer music that is supposed to be the future, but isn't, costumes that date the film beyond measure, one liners that are so simple it hurts, yet predicts the United States in 2015 better than any science fiction film since 1960?Not an easy question to answer...When I first saw this film, I hated it, mostly because is was such fiction at the time it came out. Pre home computers being normal, pre cell phones, pre NSA spying on everyone, pre reality shows, pre daft public following the strings whichever way pulled by the news which isn't news, pre world's largest prison population, pre huge percentage of general public in poverty, this film in 1987 was an insult to viewers of which I was one. At the time it came out, sure permanent living on the moon wasn't anything close to ever coming to reality by 2001, but people generally respected one another in speech and there was that whole middle class section that is almost extinct now, and the future was something to look forward to. With the current nanny state, today in 2015, collectivism is the norm, cell phones and computers are tapped, cameras everywhere, and things are being done to the public today, that even this film couldn't see coming. In short, I never ever in a million years would have guessed that this campy (though well directed and written)sci fi Running Man would ever turn out to be the closest film in the last 45 years to predict the future roughly half a century later. Even the violence which at the time was so over the top, pales to the violence on TV today (breaking bad as just one example).How we can learn from this is possibly the most important question we face today because if we all don't stop listening to the manipulations of the media that are squarely in the pockets of the government, if we all don't start using our reasoning minds instead of reacting like the audience in the movie feeling from the hip, we're in for a future that even our worst considerations will come up short. And though we all love how movies always end with the hero winning, no such hero today would ever get any air time to broadcast any message of resistance. The film's best line or monologue comes from Richard Dawson who plays Damon the one running the Running Man show at the end, for it completely and succinctly tells you what's Running our government in 2015. Maybe what we need to change are those things ""the public want"".

193,asenstoyan4ev,Very funny flick which is definitely worth your time,8,26 December 2016,"Introduction:Who the king is? Arnold is the king of the show!It is the year 1987. Ronald Reagan rules the USA, Andy Warhol quietly dies after giving a brand new notion of ""modern art"". Oliver Stone's war masterpiece ""Platoon"" wins the Oscar award for best motion picture of the year.Meanwhile, Arnold Schwarzenegger continues his glorious forward march in Hollywood, by participating in the blockbuster ""The Running Man"", initially conceived by the rich imagination of Richard Bachman, a.k.a. the master of horror Stephen King.In fact, the sci-fi action film, directed by the famous TV director and actor Paul Michael Glaser (""Starsky and Hutch"") is far from being a horror flick. Moreover, a movie starring the ludicrous Arnie can hardly be given a different definition from comedy or parody. Or at least it looks that way.The plot:Following the eponymous novel by Stephen King, the plot tells the story of the wrongly convicted for a massacre Ben Richards who is forced to participate in a highly popular reality show on TV, called ""The Running man"".In this show, convicted criminals are given the opportunity to fight for their freedom. In order to achieve that, they must face different ""stalkers""-men who hunt them all over the city with various deadly weapons. One must admit that the director has put successful efforts in his desire to recreate the futuristic, catastrophic and totalitarian society, developed by Stephen King.The Cast:The beautiful Maria Conchita Alonso in the role of Amber Mendez, the two celebrated ex-wrestlers Jesse Ventura as Captain Freedom and Professor Toru Tanaka as Subzero as well as Jim Brown, probably the most glorious NFL player ever in the role of Fireball, are among the most famous names in the cast.This is a Funny Action Movie because:Without any doubt, all eyes are on Arnold who once again steals the show and it is because of him that the film is so successful and laughable. There are plenty of unintentional comic moments featuring ""the Austrian Oak"" and we are all sure that the director didn't cut them on purpose. After all, the key to a successful Arnold movie is just to let the guy be himself in front of the camera.arnold running manThe comedy starts at the very beginning of the movie where Arnold is driving a chopper and when the crew attacks him, he starts with his moaning, which sounds like coming from a wounded panda. The famous ""Aaaargh"" is back again, and combined with his unbelievable Austrian accent and funny face moves, will definitely make you laugh.No need to mention the huge, almost unnatural muscular physic, that makes him look like a sweet debil. His muscularity and inhuman strength are demonstrated in the scene where he is easily carrying an enormous metal branch.Funnily, the scene reminds the one from ""Commando"", where Arnold is carrying a huge stump, all sweaty and with his biceps about to explode. He is just like a bodybuilder and at some moment, he is wearing a t-shirt with a stamp ""World Gym"". At this precise moment, I paused the movie and went to hit the iron by doing bench press push-ups.When our character is already in the reality show, he wears a ridiculous and tight yellow circus outfit, which makes him look even more retarded.Enough credits for Mr. Olympia.The so-called ""stalkers"" or the hunters who chase him also look very pathetic. Their costumes and unreal weapons make them look like little children who act in a school play and expect a candy from their parents in the end. Here, it is important to mention the ""trying to be sinister"" Dynamo who is dressed with dozens of luminous bulbs, just like a Christmas tree.In general, Arnie easily kills all stalkers and a smart line follows every killing to underline his supremacy.And how the heck it is possible to be in 1987 and to consider that in 2017 the cassettes will still be the main way of listening to music?Conclusion:The movie is full of dumb humor and sometimes, absurd lines, like the celebrated ""I will be back"". Arnold's acting is hilarious and wooden and the director pays homage to the feet fetish, showing Maria Conchita Alonso's beautiful legs in a pantyhose. So, enjoy! There is something for everybody.With a budget of 27 000 000 $ ""The Running Man"" is for sure worth watching, especially if you are a die-hard Arnold fan and a Stephen King admirer.Oh, and beware that you will probably feel the burning desire to go to the gym to pump your muscles.",The Running Man

But he's not in an arena. He's set loose in the city and has to escape the game show's (I guess you'd call them) villians, who bear absolutely no resemblence to the movie characters.

None of the characters' decisions make sense, and most of the bad guys wind up killing themselves or are foiled by simply punching them once. It seems like everyone involved just wanted to get it over with as quickly as possible.The action usually ends quickly. The film lingers longer on Maria Alonso tied up with her pelvis pointed at the camera longer than any of the action scenes last, or that dance scene that goes on for about 6 minutes. All just so you can look at the dancer's skimpy clothes. This movie must be a self-parody, because for all it's big talk about consumerism, it caches in heavily on sex at least. As far as violence goes, it's very PG for an 80's action movie; it makes the suggestion of violence more often than not. I'm not sure what I was supposed to get out of this garbage. It's like someone ate Total Recall, a more generic version of the Hunger Games, and the Super Mario Bros. movie, then puked them out on Arnie's Hawaiian shirt.I will say, though, it was watchable. But it was like watching a trainwreck. I kept going ""tell me they aren't going to do the obvious thing here"", and sure enough they did every single time.And the movie doesn't even end.

There are plenty of laughs and Arnie's limited acting skills and big physical presence enhance the whole aura as they usually do.The music is the normal 80's synthesiser fare and works perfectly in the films of this era. Fun film = fun, electronic music. Hollywood made the mistake of trying to make films like this too serious when they work best as they originally did in the 80's/90's. It's not believable but that's not the point.7/10 for The Running Man's high entertainment value and a story that is strangely relevant as it becomes closer and closer to reality. Ironic how Arnold is now getting involved in politics.",The Running Man
208,simjust,Looks like class B movie with good actors.,5,10 May 2020,"I was a fan of this movie in my childhood. There was one of the first cassettes with this movie, and i watched it several times. It seemed to be entertaining with good stunts, and even with some philosophy of good and evil.I decided to watch it after 25 years passing by. This time it was tough to watch till the end. It looked so primitive and stupid. Fights are made like class B action movie. Dynamo sang more then used his power, Subzero took a goalkeeper stick which was heavier and more difficult to use; he should have taken a huge medieval sword so he couldn't normally attack at all.Rebels had waited Arnold for so long time to attack the game which was not protected at all. They weren't needed a code if they rushed in the studio where they might show whatever they wanted. They ruined the game and what? Rebels go into the sunset and after the end credits get kicking ass by an army. And the kissing between Arnold and this suddenly heroic girl looks so predictable for Arnold's movies.Good acting and music. Poor screenplay and stunts.So, the movie is recommended only for young people.",The Running Man
209,LegendaryFox9,"Man, this movie was too freaking entertaining",10,5 February 2021,It has all the elements needed for pure commercial flick. From start to end the movie was thoroughly entertaining without any dull moments. Loved Arnold's character.,The Running Man
210,aberger79,"Low brow, generic, 80's sci-fi action",4,10 September 2019,"Now, I love me a good 80's sci-fi action movie, and Arnold was in some of the very best in that genre: Terminator, Predator, and Total Recall (technically 90's but it's got 80's written all over it.)The Running Man is not a good movie. It is not even a decent movie. Everything about it except for maybe Richard Dawson's part screams ""half-assed."" The sets, costumes, and sound are all perfect examples of the worst kinds of 80's trends in design, fashion, and music. Neon lights, synths, garish spandex suits in shiny solid colors, and so on. It looks cheap and ugly all around.There are many people on this site who seem to think this movie is a classic. I don't get it. Like I said, I have no bias against Arnold or this genre, and I love plenty of 80's movies. But this movie has nothing going for it-not even a single passable one liner for Arnie. Early on, when he kills the (one of many) buffoonish ""stalker"" called Sub-Zero (a large Japanese man who skates around with a lethal hockey stick), he yells to the camera, ""Sub Zero-now Plain Zero!""I can't imagine anyone laughing at that. The line should have been rejected as idiotic before whoever came up with it even put it down on paper. And yet, of the 10 or so one liners that follow, it only goes downhill from there. Truly an abysmal screenplay on all fronts.And then there is the additional fact that this film is a total insult to its source material. ""Very, very loosely based"" on Stephen King's novel sounds about right, to the point where the two have only a title and the main character's name in common.",The Running Man
211,WhitmanPriceHaddad,Reality TV Taken to the Extreme,9,27 June 2005,"This is a classic action flick from the '80s featuring Arnold Schwarzenegger in one of his most memorable roles. Set in a futuristic police state where the government controls everything, including the television networks. One of their most popular TV shows is ""The Running Man"", where convicted felons are hunted down and killed for the entertainment of millions. It's set up like a game show, where the audience votes for their favorite ""stalkers"", trained killers who hunt down and kill the show's unlucky ""contestants"". Audience members also win prizes for correctly predicting who will be killed by whom. And the host is played by none other than Family Feud's Richard Dawson, who's game show experience makes him well suited for this role. When Ben Richards (Arnold) is falsely accused of mass murder, he is forced to play this sadistic game.This movie is chock full of classic Arnold one-liners, such as his famous ""I'll be back"" right before he enters the arena. And he taunts a stalker armed with a flamethrower with ""How about a light?"" I could go on and on, but I don't want to spoil the movie. It's funny stuff!Whether it was intended or not, this movie serves as a great parody of today's ""Reality TV"" craze. Already there are numerous programs that show people enduring pain and humiliation for the entertainment of viewers, and even court cases are televised for their ""entertainment value"". Running Man demonstrates what would happen if reality TV hit rock bottom, and it is a scary picture. One can only hope that the networks have the common sense not to let it go that far.Overall, this is a fun film & I highly recommend it. 9 out of 10!",The Running Man

The book is very good and more in depth and emotional. Recommended.",The Running Man

Well, in the world of the Running Man, your needs will be sated.  For in this game show, prisoners compete for freedom, and the ultimate prize - their very lives.I loved this film.  It was such a parody on the mind-numbing tripe that we watch on a daily basis.    It isn't one of Schwarzenegger's best performances, but on the whole it is a very good film.   The underlying idea that Television Corporations will one day be the ""real""  rulers of the planet is very believable, and is very well portrayed in this film.  Of course there are the usual Arnie one-liners, my favourite is when he is about to be catapulted into the gamezone, the gameshow host asks ""Any last words?"" Arnie says: ""Yeah, I'll be back"" but the host quips ""Only in a re-run"" and presses the eject button.  I give this film a 10 for sheer originality.  I must have watched it 30 or more times.  The only film apart from the Die Hard series that I watched this often!!In short, do not for a minute think that you own the T.V.  - It owns you.....",The Running Man
214,mmsmonast,"A great action thriller, one of the best of all-time",10,17 August 2012,"I am always left a bit sad when I watch movies like the running man. And that is because I compare this action thriller with today's and I see a HUGE difference.First of all the scenario. Breakthrough, unique and well written ( it's from a book ) , something you don't see in today's movies. Then the actors, all handpicked. Arnie is at his career peak. Alonso is a very good actress who played in great movie hits like this movie and the excellent police thriller ""Colors"". Richard Dawson at the time was one of England's best stage actors and he delivers exceptionally. And all the other actors , including stalkers and even some audience help your immersion to the max. Also, the script is FANTASTIC in my opinion. The dialogues are superb and always surprise you. And they are cut and tailored to Arnie's style. Then , the scenery is tremendously atmospheric as is the colors and photography. This movie start at a pace and ends with it. I found no boring scenes, it is always interesting. All and all, this movie, has it's deeper meaning throwing spikes towards today's role of TV, how dictates public opinions and it's power in the world , as well as the violent nature of humans. And that people with money feel no regrets in going their way at any cost. I firmly believe they cannot make movies like this today because Arnie is nearing 70 y.o. and there's no one with his charisma and bulk combined today. He sure had the agents to pick pictures for him. And also , digital effects "" destroyed"" action films for me. The Running Man is an honest, great, inner thinking action film. It was not about physical strength in the end. It was about determination and brains.",The Running Man
215,schwarzeneggerfan,The Relevance Is Unreal,9,20 July 2021,"As a fan of Arnold, I could easily say that this is his most realistic and relevant movie. It almost perfectly predicts what happens in our current world from hunger to societal unrest to technology's dominance over people. With a stunning performance from our main hero as well as spectacular action scenes, this movie earns a yes from me. 9/10.",The Running Man
216,Scarlet_Fever,Read the book,3,16 March 2004,"On subsequent viewings this is not a bad film really, but i was so disappointed when i first saw it as in comparison to the book it is rubbish.The book was written under Stephen King's pseudonym Richard Bachman and is the best thing he has produced under this nom-de-plum.  A novel which is 100% plot and consequently moves like a steam train, it also provides a bleak 'Blade Runner-esque' vision of the future, but from a lower class perspective.  I had high hopes for the film, but they were dashed utterly as the result wasn't anything like the book other than the names of a few characters and the basic premise of a game show where the prize is your life.Social commentary? Gone. Bleak vision of the future? Minimal. Plotline? Gone. Cataclysmic ending? Gone.A real shame and a missed opportunity for a truly great film and given the events on 9/11, probably missed permanently now - certainly no one is going to finance a remake with the original ending intact these days.So, my advice is to see the film before you read the book.  If you like the film then the book will come as a revelation and you will see my point of view, but if you have read the book already, then give the film a wide berth as you are bound to be disappointed.However, it is not a total loss - viewed independantly of the book it is a reasonable Arnie movie, PMG does a pretty good job directing and the effects are OK for the time too.  The score is also pretty good and in general the performances are up to the task.  This is a 'Friday night after the Pub' movie, don't expect anything too deep, the book has depth, the film is all surface.",The Running Man
217,kayreffner,Good action flick!,7,7 March 2012,"This movie is about as action-packed and adrenaline-punched an action movie you're going to see in a while. We see an excuse for Schwarzenegger being thrown into an arena with killers, where he must use his brains, strategy, and most of all muscles, to kill the stalkers. But the thing is, the excuse for throwing Schwarzenegger in the arena is a good one. They didn't completely ignore the plot; they don't even throw him in the arena until at least a half hour into the film. They set up the plot first, which is nice.Arnold proves his acting talent is not just in his muscles once again. Too many people make fun of Schwarzenegger's acting skills, but to tell you the truth, I prefer him over Bruce Willis and Sylvester Stallone any day. Bruce and Sly are mumblers, in my opinion. Anyway, I like Arnold in this movie, because unlike in ""The Terminator"" where he is an indestructible cyborg, he is a vincible human with emotions in this film. We see a different side to Schwarzenegger, and it's pretty nice.Richard Dawson is surprisingly good as Damon. I love his charisma on screen. Of course he's good at playing a gameshow host--he himself was one--but he also has a very good acting talent. Check out the scene where he offers Arnold a deal for going on the show. Look how smug he is in that scene, and how well he delivers his lines. He envelops his character very well. An underrated actor if ever I saw one. He comes off slightly creepy and slightly likable.This movie is good fun no matter how you slice and dice it. I've often noticed it has a bit of a weird vibe to it, but then I realized that's just the sci-fi/futuristic vibe of the film. I've felt it before when watching sci-fi films. There's something about them. When I watch a film, or a certain genre, I get different vibes. Sci-fi gives me a weird vibe that is undescribable. This film gives that vibe to me. It sounds weird, but I think a lot of people get ""vibes"" and don't realize it.",The Running Man
218,mcewan_alex,A Masterpiece,10,3 July 2004,"Back in 1987, the concept of a society which enjoyed real-time relays of people being recorded on a 24-hour a day basis, 7-days a week seemed an idea which was very unlikely to happen. As we know now, this concept is now one of the most popular ever devised, with massive world-wide viewing figures for so-called ""reality"" television.Ironic, then, that such a notion would form the basis for one of the most entertaining action films ever produced: The Running Man.Based on the book by Stephen King, writing under a pen-name, The Running Man is inventive, funny, thrilling and rewarding.Arnie puts into some of his best work, and the result is one of the finest action films Hollywood has ever produced.The music is perfectly suited to the material, and the gags are note-perfect, especially the casting of the presenter of the show, who in actuality presents the American version of Family Fortunes (or used to).The supporting cast are of a high caliber and all in all, the work should serve as an example of how to get ideas across in a fun way.10/10",The Running Man

It has an intellectual backdrop and sometimes even surprises you with some subtle commentary, but should mostly be watched to enjoy a really great action-comedy with a bit of a campy twist.The Running Man takes a hard, yet highly entertaining look at what TV could become in a dystopian future. Released in 1987, the ""future"" is set in 2017. Reality shows have gone rampant with the number one show being ""The Running Man"" where convicted felons sign a contract in order to be chased and killed by ""Stalkers"".Considering, there were no reality shows what-so-ever in the 80s, it is pretty amazing how writer Stephen King predicted one of today's most common TV modals. This movie, however, does not go down the action-drama path and maintains a high level of humor at every stage.This spectacular 80s movie has some really great and memorable delivery of lines with only a few rare misses. It intertwines charm and jokes into the events in a way that makes the action and violence (a bit graphical, not for the squeamish PG13) stay loose and entertaining at a high degree.",The Running Man

I love this movie! The Running Man is in all likelihood God's gift to man(okay maybe just men). Definitely the most quotable movie of our time so I'll part you with my favorite line: ""It's all part of life's rich pattern Brenda, and you better F*****g  get used to it.""

This movie could have been SO much more. The trouble?  It was set during the big action movie craze.  I watched the movie and was in pain during the whole thing.  I felt nothing for the character and less for his cause.  Yes it had funny scenes (or laughable) though I think that it did not save the movie in my eyes.

There are a few good one-liners by the character played by Arnold but they aren't good enough. Th whole fight sequences that happen during the The Running Man show lacks coherence. The stalkers just keep popping up from here and there while Arnold looks like he is getting a jogging practice. Everyone acts pathetically and so is the direction. Since the book is by Stephen King, I expect it to be of a decent standard and my guess is that the movie makers messed it up. You also can't put the blame on the era, there are lots of other movies that are beautifully made during the late 80's like Predator. This one is just a shame!",The Running Man

I know Boisset's movie is based on sheckley's novel which largely inspired Stephen king for his novel. After watching it I have the feeling that the running man is also largely inspired by Boisset's movie, especially for the TV show host which in the French movie shot in 1980 is played by the incredible Michel Piccoli. Some other things are quite disturbing, the TV channel called CTV, which is even more gruesome, has a lot in common: the TV set, the killer introduction, the dancers, the way the ads are used, the Hawaii mention. The French movie emphasize a lot on the social and politics and is a bit more ""realistic"". Ending is quite different though. Nevertheless I like the running man. And it remains one of my childhood best memory.",The Running Man
229,ImminentOwl,"Schwarzenegger and 80s Sci-Fi/Action, why the hell not?",7,24 June 2013,"PLOT: The plot of The Running Man follows the false accusation of Ben Richards (played by Arnold Schwarzenegger) over the killing of dozens of civilians. He is then, upon capture, forced to participate in a morbid TV show known as The Running Man, where criminals are sent through several zones, all the while chased by ""Stalkers"", killers with unique killing methods that chase after said criminals. The film, of course, explains this far better than I can.ACTING: The acting within the movie is... somewhat spotty. Arnie's role is played much the same as many of his other 80s movies, full of one- liners, puns and generally somewhat cringe-worthy at times. However this also brings a charm to the movie, the fact that upon each encounter you kinda know that there's a pun coming up. The other characters are played varyingly, some incredibly bad and some just straight up over-acted.SET-PIECES: Throughout the film there are many rather tense fights and for the most part is a very action packed film. I was, however, disappointed by the fact that, despite it's 18 rating, there was very little blood, especially during some scenes that would have very obviously needed a lot of blood (Chainsaws, that's all I'm saying).OVERALL: Overall I give this movie a 7/10. It's certainly not Arnie's best film, and in parts it feels either a bit slow or simply so goofy that it goes from being interesting to seeming like it's going for a comedic effect. However it's definitely worth a watch if you're a fan of 80s action films as the world is very interesting and it's certainly got enough action to satiate most film fans.",The Running Man

For me this is a pleasant surprise because I can't tell you how many times I cried when Starsky or Hutch got hurt. The episode where Starsky (Kill Starsky) almost died I cried so hard My dad had to turn away from the show. What to you expect of a kid at age 12.

Arnold has a cheesy line every time he kills a bad guy. But the underlying plot is what makes it interesting. The government using tv and the entertainment industry to distract the public from their corruption. The mix of the classic 80's action movie cheese with a story line of a totalitarianism and industry corruption makes it fun to watch.

While by no means a masterpiece, the book did have a degree of depth to it in that it actually did try to convey some sort of emotionality and intelligence. The best I can figure is that in writing the movie, the screenwriter was attempting to focus more upon the concept of the degradation of human life in the face of commercialism... but ironically the movie was a superb example of the same kind of degradation and human descent into idiocy. If that irony was the intent of the writer, they failed to make as much obvious because of their sloppy work in all other departments. Chances are it was just made to be another cheap action flick to pay for Arnold's steroid habit--but I still couldn't stomach the crappy filmmaking.I'm not just another snob--I loved Terminator.

In the book, the runners weren't criminals, they were volunteers hoping to score a big prize by making it across the country without getting killed. They find out that the stalkers have a big advantage.......The vision of this movie was really written by the screenwriters. I guess at the time that King had yet to have his big successes (he was still using the Richard Bachman name), so they must have thought they could do a better job at storytelling. This movie is OK as 80s kitsch, I like watching it, but I wonder how much better it would have been if they had actually used King's story.I wonder if someone ever will.",The Running Man
237,pcolliga,Schwarzenegger's Best Performance of the 1980's,9,18 November 2007,"Many popular actors have the ability to set their own genre for movies, whether it is drama, family, comedy, or horror. Arnold Schwarzenegger is one of the most famous actors in history, mainly for setting the new bar for science fiction films. It was hard to find a popular movie in the 1980's without finding Schwarzenegger as the hero or villain. The Terminator, Terminator 2, Total Recall, and Predator are all examples of movies Schwarzenegger starred in during the 80's and are almost known by every American movie-goer today. However, there is one Schwarzenegger film unknown to many people that incorporates the greatest amount of style and taboo of the 80's. The Running Man, which was released in 1987, is one of Arnold Schwarzenegger's greatest accomplishments in his years as an actor and is a perfect film for his style of action and thrills.The Running Man was originally a novel written by Steven King, but was quite unique compared to most of his other popular horror stories. King decided to go with a different approach this time and created a disastrous game show where contestants literally ""run"" for their lives. Director Paul Michael Glaser portrayed the novel in real life by combining King's original thrilling plot with an 80's style film. Anyone who loves the 1980's will be pleased to see that the music and clothing alone reveal what era the film was created. Schwarzenegger perfectly fits into the film as the main hero, who must use his strength and abilities to survive the terrifying game show and stop a controlling and militarized government from hurting more innocent people. King's novel can be compared with George Orwell's 1984 but with a twist that a television network controls most of life in the State.The setting of The Running Man takes place in the year 2017 and begins by portraying the cop, Ben Richards (Schwarzenegger). Richards has been framed by the government to cover up a massacre of rebels in the town of Bakersfield. Richards and two other inmates escape prison and plan to flee the totalitarian country without being detected by the government. Richards comes in contact with Amber Mendez when he surprisingly discovers she moved into his brother's vacant apartment. Mendez turns Richards into the authorities and now he is confronted by Damon Killian (Richard Dawson, former host of Family Feud), the host of the RUNNING MAN game show. Killian offers Richards a position as a contestant on the show, where he could gain his freedom, or his friends from prison who helped him escape will go on in his place. Richards fears his friends will not survive the brutal show, where the contestants must get through different levels of stalkers who are constantly trying to tear the runners into shreds. However Killian tricks Richards and places his friends with him in the same sick and twisted reality show.When the game show begins it is revealed that society has become strikingly more driven on watching live violence and desires to see death and destruction coming first hand. The director perfectly portrays the unique justice system in the future and spares no detail on the horrific stalkers that are out to kill Schwarzenegger and his counterparts. Mendez is also reunited with Richards after she gets caught by the government trying to prove he is innocent. Chainsaws, bladed hockey sticks, electroshock, and flamethrowers are many obstacles they must get through to stop Killian's evil plans and reveal to the entire world what their government is doing to innocent people. Only if they manage to survive the stalkers' onslaught will they be able to go live in front of the entire world and disclose what the government is doing to its people.Viewers will find it humorous on the amount of irony the director places in this film. Taking one look into the audience in the game show will immediately make it seem like a dark and sadistic Price is Right, with almost everyone shouting for blood and violence being at least 60 years of age. Helpless old ladies have become an example of the totalitarian society that relies on strength and power to survive. It is also enjoyable seeing a combination between a family game show and a bloodbath showdown that even prisoners would cringe at the thought of being a participant.It even seems that The Running Man has helped influence a recent movie that has a similar scheme as with another sadistic game show where contestants have to kill to survive. The Condemned, released in 2006, has a game show more technologically advanced Killian's RUNNING MAN, where this time criminals are placed on an island and must kill each other until there is only one last survivor declared winner.",The Running Man
238,cngraves1,Recommend reading the book,3,22 January 2010,"Have you ever read the book? It's found under the author name ""Richard Bachman"". In case you're wondering, Steven King wrote under this title because it (and the other three) didn't fit in the thriller/horror genre that he usually wrote in, and he was worried that people wouldn't like it. Anyway, the book is far better than the movie. It is not as exciting, but it does have a strong plot, and is well-written. Beware, though, it might be hard to find. The Bachman Books were pulled from publication by the author, due to his fear that they were giving people the wrong ideas. The first one pulled was called ""Getting It On"", and was about a teenager who took a gun to school. Perhaps King might be afraid of ""The Running Man"" as well, because the book ends with the hero commandeering a passenger jet and crashing it into a government building...",The Running Man

240,praklaw-223-584309,I love Arnold but PUKE,3,2 August 2018,"Bad costumes, bad dialog, cheesy music and even more CHEESY villians....I swear....they literally covered one of the villians with a ""light bright"" gameboard. This was a full on released movie....V...a tv show released 3 years prior had 10x the special effects and quality....still love Arnold but the Running Man is near the bottom of crap barrel....probably his weakest film...though bad costumes and cheesy everything isnt his fault.",The Running Man
241,damion-littlewood,Arnie at his best,10,15 September 2019,"I was 11 when this film was released. My parents or my older brothers rented it from the video man. After waiting 10 minutes for the tape to rewind because the previous people didn't rewind it, on it went. Maybe I should not have watched it at 11 but I did and I loved it. I must have watched it 100 times since having bought it on all formats and also watched it whenever it's on the TV. Arnie is great in it as are the rest of the cast. The added bonus is the soundtrack. It screams 80s and that's another thing I love about it. Whenever I watch it it takes my back to my childhood and happy memories. This film started my love for Arnie films.",The Running Man
242,haelward,Too many annoying flaws,3,15 July 2004,":::SPOILER ALERT:::Soooo, Arnie's really a good guy, but after an incident with some fighting in a helicopter and some disobeying of orders, he's sent to jail (or rather some sort of work camp). He escapes, but after a short while he's caught once again. This time ends up in a freakish reality show in which he's supposed to run for a while from a bunch of tough guys with different themes, and eventually die. But we all know Arnie, and we all know that he's tougher than even the toughest of tough guys.I really wanted to like this movie, being an Arnie-fan and all. However, ""The Running Man"" contains too many flaws that really annoy the crap out of me. E.g. The reconstruction of Arnie's fight inside the helicopter, where the shocked audience is showed a short summary of the incident, complete with 5-10 different camera angles. This means that the military helicopter in which Arnie flew was equipped with almost 10 cameras filming the crew members, one of which _inside_ the eye of one of the crew members Arnie beats.There are other flaws also, and the plot, which in theory seems to be very interesting and innovative, works for a while, then it sort of creates a pool of stupidness and unrealism in which it drowns.The acting can't really be said to be anything better than sub par, with Arnie in the leading role, doing an average Arnie performance. The rest of the cast get by without being especially good or bad.The special effects are OK, without being impressive.RATING: 3/10",The Running Man
243,davepoo,Its nothing like the book,6,6 November 2005,"Although this film is somewhat filled with eighties cheese i have a place for it in my DVD rack and i don't know why. I think i like it because the moral of the story is 'television is garbage so turn it off and go and get a life'. For those of you who do decide to heed the message then you should try reading the book, its nothing like the film at all. To ruin it for you at the end of the story a fatally wounded Richards ends up crashing a plane into the network building, killing himself, everyone inside and shutting down the network at the same time. I read it many years ago but today it would hard not to compare it to 9/11.",The Running Man
244,john-housley,Hey Christmas tree..,9,11 June 2005,"How can the running man be only rated as 6.2???????? What are you people on... OK it wont win any script awards but show me a Arnie film that would...We all watch Arnie's 80's and early 90's action films for one reason... they were, and still are the best example of hard action films around today. This film is everything that the modern day prosaic PG or 12 rated action films are not.So what are you getting for your hard earned pennies? Well, cheesy one liners, lots of people being shot, knived in the back with biro's and forced to wear criminally tight loetards that's what!To this day this stands out as one of Arnie's best films. Please log off your PC, make yourself a cup of tea and go and watch it............... NOW.",The Running Man
245,mrbluecat,"Great concept, interesting characters, fantastic film!",10,5 December 2005,"If anybody is intending to watch this film and get deep meanings and multi-layered narratives then don't. If you want a great sci-fi action movie to watch anytime with a couple of beers and some nachos then do. I have to rate The Running Man as one of my favourite films of all time. The concept of the film is unique and very few sci-fi films come close to capturing the dystopian atmosphere and brutality, and who better to deliver it than a bearded Arnie? Love interest Maria Conchita Alonso does a good job of trying to infuriate the audience, and the support actors complete their task of getting killed-off superbly. Arnie is superb, easily one of his best works, and of course the icing on the cake has to be seeing Killian (who reminds me of X-Factor judge Louis Walsh) get his just deserts. The only flaw in my opinion is the part where Arnie escapes the battlezone, which I found slightly unimaginative. However overall the film is successful in conveying its warning about the power of the media and the consequences of a police state, while delivering a hefty slice of sci-fi action, one-liners and running along the way.",The Running Man
246,blowis,Dynamo had no pants,10,30 March 2008,"Why didn't Dynamo have any pants?! Where did they go?? It was never explained. That's why this movie was so awesome. Plus Starsky gave his kids the AIDS!!!! Great acting too. Richard Dawson deserved to win Best Supporting Actor! A I D S My favorite line from the movie was ""That hit the spot"" A I D S. This movie was for the ""birds"". I tried to give this movie the ""stinkeye"" but it continued playing. What am I doing wrong???!!!! I thought the ""HATEBOAT"" was funnnny lol ;) I would like that for a show. Why wasn't Dynamo wearing pants. I know his arm WAS skewered but... What's up with those crazy futur nets. Why didn't that family feud guy Ray Combs get a net?? He could have used one. AIDSSSSS",The Running Man
247,TravisChelios,Cheesy 80's Brilliance,7,27 January 2007,"(***Potential Spoiler***) The Movie is called Running Man, Its from the 80's, It stars Arnold Schwartzeneger and the Tag Line goes something like ""A game nobody survives. But Schwarzenegger has yet to play"". Honestly you should know what sort of movie to expect. So if Dumb action movies are not your thing then stay clear and reserve your comments to yourself, if not sit back have a few beers, maybe some Snacks, get a few Friends round and enjoy 90 Minutes of senseless Fun.The Film is set in the not too distant future(2017). America is a military controlled state and the citizens are severely oppressed. Arnie plays Ben Richards, a former police officer who is wrongly convicted of the massacre of innocent civilians. Sent to prison, Arnie escapes only to be captured again. His only choice now is to take part in a sinister Game show where Convicted Criminals Face deadly opponents. Along with two other convicts William Laughlin (Yaphet Kotto) and Harold Weiss (Marvin J.McIntyre) and a woman Richards met along the way, Amber Mendez (Maria Conchita Alonso), Arnold must try his best to survive this game show hell.Along the way Richards battles Maniacs with Chainsaws, FlameThrowers and Electro bolts. Expect the usual Action and Violence seen in films such as Commando and Predator and of course a few Golden ""Arnie"" Lines thrown in there all in the pursuit of delivering justice to Richards' Biggest enemy, the game show host Damon Killian (Richard Dawson).If you want to watch a cinematic Masterpiece, see Casablanca or The Godfather. If you want to see a film regarded as Art, look at Fellini films. If you want to see a fun action ARNIE film watch the Running Man. Perhaps a bit dated (A not too dissimilar more recent film is perhaps Battle Royale) but arguably this film never gets old as it can be watched over and over again. Is it predictable? Yes. Is it Stupid? Yes. Is it Cheesy? Yes. But is it Fun? VERY MUCH SO, YES.7.5/10",The Running Man
