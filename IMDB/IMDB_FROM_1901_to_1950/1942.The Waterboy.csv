0,MartinHafer,Sometimes you just need a stupid film like this to make you laugh,8,1 March 2009,"Although I love a good foreign or independent film, sometimes I am in the mood for a good old stupid film like THE WATERBOY. This is not meant as an insult, as the makers of this film intended for it to be very dumb and in the process the film is also quite entertaining. There are many times I could just use some mindless fun and I am thankful that films like the Bill and Ted films, UHF, TALLADEGA NIGHTS and THE WATERBOY are there when I am in the mood for goofiness.Adam Sandler stars as Bobby Boucher--a guy so socially inept people assume he is an idiot. His sole desire in life when he film begins is to be a water boy for a football team--even though he's in his 30s! When he shows up at South Central Louisiana State University looking for this job, the coach (Henry Winkler) lets him do it---provided he doesn't have to pay Boucher! Oddly, Boucher looks at his job as if it were a science and he takes amazing pride in such a menial and worthless job. In the process, he looks like a total geek and the players make fun of him constantly. Eventually, all the needling reminds him of all the many, many, many times others have made fun of him over the years and he reacts by knocking one of the players off his feet. Not realizing it, Boucher was able to channel his 31 years of rage into tackling. Winkler realizes Boucher's potential and gets him to agree to play football--even though Boucher's mama (Kathy Bates) thinks ""foosball is of the Devil!"". This is accomplished by pretending that he's just the team's water boy. I loved when he came home bruised up after a game and explained that it was because he was beaten up by an escaped gorilla....and she believed it!! However, when Mama finally learns the truth, she slips into an unknown illness and Waterboy is unable to bring himself to play in the super-important Bourbon Bowl!The film abounds with stupid moments--the sort that make kids laugh and adult often pretend aren't funny. I believe that most sophisticated adults WILL like the film but should probably only watch it when the kids are asleep--otherwise the children will realize that their parents are capable of laughing at Adam Sandler.Clever writing, lots of silly gags (such as his run-in with 'Colonel Sanders') and a part that works well for Sandler, this is one of his better films. I also recommend you try watching THE WEDDING SINGER. And, because I care about you, I advise you to avoid LITTLE NICKY like the plague, as its juvenile humor is something only the most seriously brain damaged can appreciate. It's just not funny.By the way, the plot of THE WATERBOY is in many ways a variation on Stephen King's CARRIE. Carrie's mother IS Bobby Boucher's mother in many different ways. And, instead of cool telekinesis, Bobby's ""magic power"" is his ability to tackle. Think about it.",The Waterboy
1,TheLittleSongbird,"The plot is admittedly slow, but the film is somewhat endearing",7,1 June 2010,"I do agree the story takes a long time to develop, the script at times is not great(too many dumb moments) and the pacing is uneven, but The Waterboy is actually somewhat endearing. And it has Adam Sandler in it, an actor I don't care for, but he was surprisingly amusing here. I do think though that Kathy Bates(ever the pro)as the Cajun mum and Henry Winkler as the bewildered coach gave much better performances. The film does look striking, with nice cinematography and scenery, and the soundtrack is nice. The sports sequences are lovingly done, and the direction is efficient enough. Overall, it isn't groundbreaking, but it is an endearing and amusing film. 7/10 Bethany Cox",The Waterboy
2,Leofwine_draca,A real failure,3,14 September 2021,"Something I had the misfortune to see at the cinema. I'd never seen Adam Sandler before and I've gone out of my way to avoid his witlessness ever since. Plus I'm as far from a sports fan as you can get, particularly American sports, so this was a real failure for me.",The Waterboy
3,SnoopyStyle,no real laughs but somewhat watchable,5,20 March 2015,"Bobby Boucher (Adam Sandler) is the slow lowly 31 year old waterboy for the UL football team. Everybody is picking on him. Coach Red Beaulieu (Jerry Reed) fires him for disrupting practice. He goes home to Jackson's Bayou, Louisiana to his domineering mama (Kathy Bates). He goes to the rundown South Central Lousiana State University. Coach Klein (Henry Winkler) hires the waterboy and then discovers that he's a great tackler. He becomes the new linebacker with the kicker Derek Wallace as his only friend. He goes out with Vicki Vallencourt (Fairuza Balk) who just got out of jail despite his mother's objections.It's not that funny but it's still a passable watch. Sandler is playing another idiot but he's a likable idiot. The mannerisms can be annoying to some but it's inoffensive to me. There are a few too many bullies. I don't think most of the players would still pick on him as he gets all those sacks. There's a missing scene where somebody on the team gets impressed by his tackling, changes his mind and stands up to the quarterback. In the end, it's somewhat watchable but no real laughs with so many shallow unimaginative jokes.",The Waterboy
4,claudio_carvalho,Another Silly Movie of the Charismatic Adam Sandler,6,2 October 2003,"Bobby Boucher (Adam Sandler) is a thirty-one years old man with the mentality of a boy, and completely dominated by his mama (Kathy Bates). He supplies water to the football players and is a completely idiot. He is fired by the couch of his team and gets another job as water boy with a very poor and loser team. There, the couch finds out his potentiality as a soccer player, using his repressed anger. This is another silly movie of the charismatic Adam Sandler. Based on low-level jokes, terrible pronunciation and accent from the Mississippi area and American football, this movie was a great success in USA, but has not much to offer to viewers of countries that do not practice this sport. It may be a way of killing time and have some fun, but it is totally forgettable. My vote is six.",The Waterboy
5,lee_eisenberg,"it may be hard to believe, but I derived some character development",7,9 September 2007,"If I remember right, when ""The Waterboy"" got released, critics called it things like ""a deflated football comedy"" and ""utterly dehydrated"" (and some considered it ironic that Oscar-winner Kathy Bates stars). Well, when I saw it a little while later, I did something that probably few if any people did: I derived some character development. It seems that Adam Sandler's character is one of these guys afraid to challenge his domineering mother to the point where he reacts if people challenge what she says, and so football is the only way for him to assert himself.Then again, I might be reading too far into the movie; it was most likely intended as silly entertainment (and it mostly is quite goofy, especially with Henry Winkler's Roy Orbison tattoo). See what you think. Also starring Fairuza Balk and Rob Schneider.",The Waterboy
6,jboothmillard,The Waterboy,5,23 September 2005,"A good story about one not very intelligent guy with two special talents, the more important one bing to get an opponent down in a game of American football, the other being to poor water for players and the audience. Adam Sandler plays Robert 'Bobby' Boucher Jr., otherwise known as The Waterboy to everyone at the stadium. He lives with his mother Helen 'Mama' Boucher (Kathy Bates) who teaches him quite a few rubbish things, but he knows she is right sometimes. Anyway, later Bobby shows his talent for running at a player when he is picked on. Coach Klein (Scream's Henry Winkler) sees this talent and decides to put him on the team. He does very well, and eventually when his Mama finds out (obviously she disapproves at first) she accepts it and supports him. Worth watching!",The Waterboy
7,ccthemovieman-1,Revenge Of The Cajun Nerd,9,27 February 2006,"I have to admit: this Adam Sandler no-brainer is hilarious, just had me laughing right from the start. I'd rank it in my top ten funny movies of my collection and it features one of my favorite characters in film: Bobby Boucher Jr., a heckuva lot nicer guy than Sandler's ""Happy Gilmore."" ""Bobby"" is about as innocent and a gentle-natured a guy as you'll find this side of Forrest Gump. You can't help but root for him, and that's the idea. What the film basically involves is another ""Revenge Of The Nerds"" theme except it's ""nerd ""- singular - as the picked-on waterboy turning the tables on the football jocks. Interesting to once again see Jerry Reed, whom I haven't seen much of since his days in ""Smokey And The Bandit."" He has much fatter face but everything else looked the same. Then there is Henry Winkler, ""The Fonz"" who now is the opposite: a guy with a terrible inferiority complex. All the characters in here are wildly exaggerated.This cartoon-like comedy may not be high-brow, but so what? It's not totally low- brow either, but I do wonder why modern filmmakers cannot seem to make a comedy without all the sex references and the profanity. Nonetheless, Sandler's Cajun accent, his strange-looking-but pretty girlfriend (Fairuza Balk) and crazy mother (Kathy Bates, in the funniest role she's ever played) are all great fun to watch.It's silly, particularly the ridiculous climactic football game, but then this movie is hardly to be taken seriously. It's all absurd humor, and 90 minutes was just right amount of time for it.",The Waterboy
8,Quinoa1984,Sandler's best since Billy Madison,6,30 April 2000,"I really liked the Waterboy.  It was crude, raw, and utterly funny.  Adam Sandler gives his funniest yet since his 1995 cult hit Billy Madison.  In this feel good movie, Sandler plays a dumb waterboy who gets on a football team and becomes a damn good tackler.  Everything in this film is funny, from beginning to end.  Henry Winkler has his best in years as a down on his luck coach and Kathy Bates is Dead Pan funny as mama.  Great all around.

10,hitchcockthelegend,No son of mine is gonna play any foos-ball.,4,20 May 2009,"Simpleton Bobby Boucher is the water boy for a college football team, until he gets fired for like the umpteenth time. Then just as Bobby thinks his life is empty, another coach discovers that Bobby has an incredible talent for tackling players. The secret is by getting Bobby thinking he's being made fun of, thus the formula works and Bobby becomes the team star player, but that brings about its own drawbacks.Speaking as someone who happily indulges in the odd bit of Adam Sandler nonsense, i have to say that this picture, alongside the god awful Little Nicky, is easily one of his worst efforts. I just find the well trodden story tiresome in the extreme, and were it not for a couple of strong supporting turns from Henry Winkler and Kathy Bates, the film would have sunk into the swamp where it deserves to be. It promises much in the first quarter, Sandler's goo-fish charm offering up a comic delight, but come the half way point you realise it's essentially a one joke movie. With Sandler unable to break his Bobby character free from the confines of an idiot savant played for laughs.Not one recommended to anyone other than the staunchest of Sandler supporters. 4/10",The Waterboy
11,grantss,Silly but entertaining,6,5 April 2017,"Bobby Boucher is 31, lives at home with his mother and is the waterboy for the University of Louisiana Cougars. One day he is fired and ends up being the waterboy for a down-and-out college team, the South Central Louisiana State University Mud Dogs. During an incident in training, Bobby demonstrates himself to be a ferocious tackler, and he is picked for the team's defense. Thanks to him, the Mud Dogs' fortunes soar. However, his mother doesn't approve of him playing football...Silly but entertaining. Started quite weakly, largely using Bobby's disabilities to score cheap laughs. The whole Louisiana inbred/hick thing was laid on pretty thick and got quite tiresome, quite quickly. However, as the movie progresses it gains momentum, shakes off the cheap laughs and becomes reasonably entertaining.Not that it doesn't still have its silly moments towards the end, but these become few and further between.Overall: not a must-see, but if you're looking for something mindlessly entertaining, this isn't so bad.",The Waterboy
12,view_and_review,Incredibly Funny,8,13 December 2006,"For sheer laughs, ""The Waterboy"" has to be my favorite Adam Sandler movie. The movie was incredibly silly and ridiculous even, which was all I was looking for. Most of his movies lately have had better stories and plots to them, but they lacked the amount of silly laugh-out-loud moments.""The Waterboy"" was a revenge of the nerds/David v. Goliath story. Bobby Boucher (Adam Sandler) is a meek Momma's boy who was able to tap into his inner rage and bring out a destructive animal, which makes him perfect for football. The movie goes through a series of hilarious events as Bobby Boucher leads his college football team to a bowl game. The type of character Bobby Boucher is allows for there to be a lot of silly and laughable moments. As a man I can say this is definitely more of a man's movie. So, just put your intellect aside for a couple of hours and watch and enjoy.",The Waterboy
13,Uriah43,A Football Superstar Waiting to be Unleashed,5,5 October 2018,"""Bobby Boucher"" (Adam Sandler) is a nice, young man who has had the misfortune of being without a father since the moment he was born and also having a domineering mother known simply as ""Mama Boucher"" (Kathy Bates) who won't let him do anything without her approval. He is also rather naïve and dim-witted as well and it's because of this that he is content to serve as the waterboy for a team that not only doesn't appreciate him--but bullies him at every opportunity. Then one day, because he is the team's scapegoat, he is fired by the vicious and mean-spirited coach named ""Red Beaulieu"" (Jerry Reed) fires him for no reason. So with nothing else to lose Bobby decides to seek employment at another nearby college. To his surprise, he is eagerly accepted by ""Coach Klein"" (Henry Winkler) who is only too glad to have somebody help his rather beleaguered team any way they can. And not long afterward Coach Klein discovers that underneath the mild-mannered and fragile exterior of his waterboy lies a football superstar waiting to be unleashed upon the sports world. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that this was a cute comedy which featured some good performances by all of the aforementioned actors. Unfortunately, it also had a few scenes which lacked both humor and taste and this caused the film to seem somewhat uneven. Be that as it may, it was still entertaining for the most part and for that reason I have rated it accordingly. Average.",The Waterboy
14,anaconda-40658,Watered Down.,3,6 January 2016,"The Waterboy (1998): Dir: Frank Coraci / Cast: Adam Sandler, Kathy Bates, Henry Winkler, Fairuza Balk, Jerry Reed: Standard comedy about the little guy who will become a big somebody. Adam Sandler plays the waterboy for a football team. He lives with his overbearing mother who claims that everything is ""the Devil."" His mother will not allow him to play football but the coach puts him on the team anyway suggesting that he visualize an attack. He visualizes everyone who has insulted him throughout his life. Predictable and ridiculous with characters that seem like distant cousins of Farmer Vincent of Motel Hell. Directed by Frank Coraci who previously directed Sandler in the more appealing The Wedding Singer. Part of the problem is that Sandler is not only unsympathetic but his voice is irritable. Supporting actors suffer from characters who come off as comic types rather than personalities. Kathy Bates as his strict mother is straight forward right up to her mind change regarding the apron strings. Henry Winkler as a struggling coach is pretty much what viewers can expect. Fairuza Balk as his trashy girlfriend is more a thought than an actual person. Jerry Reed is cast as a nasty coach who belittles Sandler. Strong theme of self respect and standing up for oneself with a screenplay that is washed up with little to keep it afloat. Score: 3 / 10",The Waterboy
15,FlashCallahan,You can do it.......,6,26 February 2012,"31-year-old water boy, Bobby Boucher is constantly tormented by the team he works for until he is fired by the coach.He then finds a new coach to work for. Here he finds a new talent, tackling people by pretending they're making fun of them.Soon, he becomes the best linebacker in college football, but he must keep it secret from his overprotective mother....Well this film shouldn't work, it's just a lot of different sketches rolled into one movie centred around the life of the titular character, with a few sight gags thrown in, and random people who speak funny.It shouldn't work, but it does, and is consistently funny, for all the right reasons.It's as god as any other Sandler movie, and as bad as any Sandler movie, if you know what I mean.The reason why Sandlers film work so well, is because they are simple, and easy to follow, but then they just have stupid line thrown in like 'A Gorilla escaped from the Zoo and punched you in the face' that you just have to laugh.Support is great from all the cast, and it's ironic that Sandlers character appears to be the most normal out of the whole bunch.If your not a fan of Sandler, ignore it, but seeing that this was the biggest sports movie of all time before 'the blind side', is saying a lot.",The Waterboy
16,StevePulaski,Sandler's worst thus far,1,24 April 2012,"Adam Sandler has succeeded in making his lamest, most desperate feature thus far. The Waterboy is an atrocious picture, comically and socially inept, pathetically humorless, and void of all things likable.Sandler has taken the formulaic structure of his previous feature, Happy Gilmore, made a few adjustments to the character and pacing, and somehow made a less likable film altogether. I've mentioned before that despite all the praise I have heard, I found Happy Gilmore to be a mediocre comedy. The Waterboy manages to take an already unnecessary screenplay and formula of creating an unlikable protagonist that is nothing shy of intolerable and again making him the main character in the film. The first step to making a bad film.The film is played the same way as well. Sandler is Bobby Boucher a stuttering water boy for the Louisiana Cougars. He is constantly pushed around for his strange lisp-like accent and the fact that he never fights back. After being kicked off the Cougars team, he approaches Coach Klein (Winkler) of the South Central Louisiana State University Mud Dogs. Klein discovers that when Bobby becomes angry, he becomes violent and that can help the team. So commences underdog story number two-thousand as Bobby goes from nothing to something.I am beginning to reach a personal quandary. How is possible to assemble a comedy film where not a single character is likable or even remotely tolerable? This shouldn't come as a surprise. Sandler's exercise in poor taste can be considered even poorer than poor taste. Let's look at his past and current filmography. We have the mediocre Happy Gilmore, the crass and pathetic I Now Pronounce You Chuck and Larry, the melodramatic but strangely acceptable Click, the well-crafted 50 First Dates (despite a few problems I mentioned in my review), the underwhelming Grown Ups, the incredibly unlikable Just Go With It, and the most recent abomination, Jack and Jill. Man, can a filmography get anymore divided? I believe the reason Sandler is such an unbalanced actor is the fact he can't make a comedy without making characters that are shallow, immoral, and intolerable, or make a drama without being ridiculous and unnecessarily comedic. The Waterboy is on a whole different level, though. It doesn't even feel like it is trying to be creative or clever. It's an assembly of repetitive sequences, plagued with an immediately unconvincing character that is sadly our protagonist, a script that feels distended and uninspired, and a formula that may as well have just told us in the beginning how the thing turns out. You know how movies do that? They make the end sequence first, hardly leaving any suspense for the real ending? The Waterboy needed that so many unfortunate audience members would be spared of inane dreck.Starring: Adam Sandler, Kathy Bates, Henry Winkler, Fairuza Balk, and Jerry Reed. Directed by: Frank Coraci.",The Waterboy
17,Smells_Like_Cheese,Not as funny as I remember,6,15 January 2004,"The Waterboy is one of those movies that I really loved as a kid, I was 12 years old when this movie came out and I thought it was just the most hilarious movie I had ever seen. So growing up I re-watched it thinking that I would still enjoy the movie as much as I did when I was younger. But honestly I wasn't laughing as much as I did when I was 12, I think because it was for the most part it was just junior high humor. Is The Waterboy a funny movie? Yeah, I'm not going to lie, I still got a few good laughs out of it; it's just baffling to me that a grown man could make millions of dollars while making baby voices, that's the power of Adam Sandler.Bobby Boucher, a pretty stupid, stuttering, water boy with anger issues due to constant teasing and his mother's excessive sheltering. He was the water boy for the University of Louisiana Cougars or the past 18 years, but the players tormented him, and the team's head coach, Coach Red Beaulieu, fired him for disrupting his team's practices. He later goes to Coach Klein, coach of the Mud Dogs, and volunteers to work as the team's water boy for free after seeing the filthy water that the coach provides his players. During his first few hours of being waterboy for the Mud Dogs, one of the players spits into the water can. A flashback is then seen when the waterboy was a young kid working for the Cougars. Coach Beaulieu refuses the right for the waterboy to retaliate against one of his players for spitting in the cooler. Coach Klein notices his anger problem and encourages Bobby to stand up for himself instead of letting the players walk all over him. After Grenouille, the team's captain taunts him, Bobby then sees flashbacks of the people that also made his life a living hell. Bobby then effortlessly runs onto the field, grunting and growling in sheer anger and tackles Grenouille, shocking the whole team and prompting Coach Klein to put him on the field, with positive results. Despite his overprotective mother's disapproval, he secretly continues to play football, and also secretly goes to school. He uses his anger to tackle the opposing players by pretending they're the people who made fun of him throughout his life. He quickly becomes one of the most feared linebackers in college football and love interest of Vicki Vallencourt.While The Waterboy is stupid in a lot of moments, over all it's just a harmless comedy that is just for fun. I still love quoting certain lines to it, especially when Bobby attacks his college professor because his mama was insulted. Another reason I can't hate this movie is that this was the time that Adam Sandler was actually funny and we enjoyed seeing his movies. I think the reason why people just didn't respond as well to this movie as his other films was due to the fact that a lot of his movies are the same plot with a different character: Happy Gilmore or Billy Madison. The Wedding Singer was his first movie that was completely original and that's why it's so well loved. But I still would recommend seeing The Waterboy for a few good laughs, you have to love some of the fantasies that Bobby comes up with, such as ""Water sucks, Gatorade tastes better"", you'll have to see what I mean, but trust me, it's a good scene.6/10",The Waterboy
18,g-bodyl,Decently Funny!,7,21 September 2011,"The Waterboy is not that bad of a movie. I have to say this is my least favorite Adam Sandler movie and I'm giving it a 7 so it says a lot about my liking of Sandler. Maybe it was the annoying voice of Sandler's character, but I felt detracted somewhat during the entire movie.This is about a water boy who becomes a ""star"" football player on a ragtag team because he tackles his opponents harshly and without mercy. Meanwhile he has to keep this a secret all from his too-nosy mother.I didn't like Sandler's character a lot. I was disappointed about that. I did love Kathy Bates as his mother. Now she was the one who had me laughing.Overall, this a solid, watchable film. It has the same old formulaic sports story but I still liked it. I rate this film 7/10.",The Waterboy

It truly is the worst thing ever created. Adam Sandler is the most untalented comic actor in history. He got paid $20 million for this waste of celluloid.What a travesty. There are people starving in this world and to think of such an uncharismatic actor, who has basically coasted his way into stardom, earning that amount of money for pulling a few faces and doing a stupid voice makes me sick.An utter, utter, utter pile of total, 100%, bonafide, no doubt about it, absolute crap.Never, ever see for any reason.",The Waterboy
21,The-Sarkologist,Adam Sandler's Charm,8,12 March 2020,"I'm rather surprised that this, one of my favourite movies from the 90s, hasn't been reviewed, at least by me, yet. I guess then that my hankering to actually watch it for some reason was a good thing since it might have simply slipped my mind and then I would have never got around to writing one. Mind you, I'm sure I would have eventually watched it again though because I did find it quite lovely, and that there are actually a few good laughs as well.So, we have Adam Sandler playing this lad named Bobby Boucher. He happens to be the waterboy for a local college football team, but is eventually sacked because the team spends more time picking on him than they do actually playing the game (though they do happen to be pretty good nonetheless). So, Bobby goes off and finds himself another role at another team, this one a lot worse in that they haven't won a game for ages. Well, the teasing continues, but this time the coach (played by none other than Henry Winkler) suggests that Bobby stick up for himself, at which point he realises that Bobby's anger issues could be used to his advantage, on the football field that is.Well, if you are familiar with other Adam Sandler movies then you are probably going to be familiar with this one. Yeah, that is the idea that pretty much every Adam Sandler movie in existence is about a man-boy who is forced to grow up. Then again the reason that I particularly liked this movie was that it wasn't necessarily about a guy that didn't want to grow up, but was forced to, but rather it was about this guy that lived a rather sheltered life because of his overtly domineering mother. In fact, there is a pretty good reason for that, especially since we learn that his father disappeared before he was born.Which turned out to be a pretty good reason as to why he ended up becoming not just a waterboy, but a really obsessive waterboy. Namely he believed that his father died of thirst in the desert, and as such decided from a young age that he would do what he could to make sure that nobody else suffered the same fate, though ironically this ended up being on the football field than anyplace where it really counted. Still, the film probably wouldn't have worked all that well otherwise.On the other hand, this is also another one of those common type movies where we have a struggling sports team that eventually turns their season around and makes the finals. In fact, they eventually make the grand final, or what is called the Bourbon Bowl (not doubt due to it being played in the Gulf States, or at least in Louisiana). As you can probably guess, they do eventually win the game, but such a film wouldn't work if it the result wasn't touch and go at the end, but rather a thrilling conclusion. Yeah, these type of films do generally pan out the same.Still, I really do quite like this film, particularly Adam Sandler's character. Mind you, one could also describe it as being one of those films where we have a character who appears to not really be all that good at anything, but eventually we discover that he has a hidden talent that makes him really good at something and he eventually excels in a way that we, nor anybody else, realised. Of course, we also have the situation where he also eventually over comes all of the obstacles that are in his path to succeed as well. Sure, it may be like every Adam Sandler movie ever made, but there also seems to be this charm about this film that raises it above and beyond the rest.",The Waterboy
22,jacobjohntaylor1,Any comedy movie could be popular,1,27 February 2019,This is crap. I can not believe people like this. If you think this is funny you think ever thing is funny. This movie has an awful story line. It not funny at all. There is not reason for this to be popular. This is not about being funny. This is a money grab.,The Waterboy
23,Floated2,Some chuckles but overall not funny,3,14 February 2017,"The Waterboy is one of Adam Sandler's more well known and successful comedy films of the 90's (It was his biggest films up until 2010). This film is mainly directed to his teenage fanbase and in this case, there are several issues and just moronic errors about it. We all understand this film is a comedy but it is far too unrealistic and comes off as just irritating and annoying. Comparing the Waterboy to Happy Gilmore (a much better film) we see him beat up Bob Barker. In The Waterboy, he plays a lisp-speaking, clumsy, little mama's boy whose life has no direction, no purpose, and, apparently, no human intelligence. After he is hired to be the water boy for a crumbling Louisiana football team, a few of the 'star' players enjoy insulting him every chance they get. When he's at the point where he just can't take it anymore, he exclaims 'stop making fun of me,' and head-butts them, sort of like a tackle. What is unrealistic about this is that all it takes for Bobby to make the team and be their star player is one tackle. There are a few chuckles in the movie but after a while we tend to realize how silly overall the film is.Just like it every Sandler comedy, the end product is quite predictable. We ends up succeeding while being the underdog and ends with the love interest. Sandler himself can be funny, but tackling football players because they make fun of him is no amusing. It gets old fast. His mama was funny at first but they kept the gag overdoing itself where he stopped being anything. The Waterboy has not aged well over the years either.",The Waterboy
24,helpless_dancer,Predictable yet enjoyable,7,17 February 2004,"Sandler does have other acts besides the no brain screw up, right? Guess I've just missed them along the way.

Nothing new here but still good for a rainy afternoon.",The Waterboy
25,Anonymous_Maxine,"Yes, it's foolish and campy, but that's exactly what it's supposed to be.",7,5 April 2002,"In Adam Sandler's tremendously successful 1998 comedy, The Waterboy, he plays the part of intellectually stunted Bobby Boucher. Bobby is a waterboy for various footballs teams, from whom he receives and seems to expect no respect whatsoever. This is obviously not the kind of movie that is meant to win any awards (what Sandler movie is?), but there is a definite place for movies like this. The character that Sandler creates is hideously annoying, but the comedy that comes from that is unmistakable. The laughs aren't very durable, but there are some good laughs that come from the lines that Boucher mumbles throughout the movie, and the situations are even better.While it's true that The Waterboy is a thinly veiled version of the age-old structure of the underdog coming back and winning big, the film as a whole serves its purpose well, as long as you keep in mind what that purpose is. You watch a movie like this in order to get a few cheap laughs, and that's exactly what it gives you. It's well written because it was made to be exactly the kind of movie that it is, and it can't be criticized for that. Kathy Bates is wonderful as Bobby's horribly over-bearing mother, and Henry Winkler, who was The Fonz about 1,000 years ago, has stooped to a heart-breakingly low level as the pathetic coach of the pathetic football team that Boucher saves as the star tackler. The scene with Coach Klein (Winkler) talking to his grandmother about his problems on a disconnected phone while wearing a pair of high heels is a particularly sad thing to see the original Arthur Fonzarelli to have degenerated to.On the other hand, the football scenes, which are clearly the emphasis of the film, are undeniably fun to watch. It's a classic underdog structure, but it's great to watch Bobby earnestly wish the opposing players the best of luck on the upcoming play, only to receive an offensive reply and then throw everyone else aside on his way to that player to deliver a massive tackle, even if it means sacrificing the play. We've already seen dozens of football movies, so we already know exactly how this is going to end, but luckily we have a lot of fun getting there. There is some shallow writing and an uninteresting romantic subplot (involving the simultaneously hideous yet strangely attractive Fairuza Balk) thrown into the film, as well as the obligatory happy ending, but as is generally the case with Sandler's movies, The Waterboy delivers what it is expected to deliver, as long as you don't expect something unreasonable from it. This was not meant to be a great film, and will be seriously considered that by virtually no one, but as a cheesy comedy with some genuinely amusing moments, The Waterboy is a huge success.",The Waterboy
26,GOWBTW,A fine movie by Sandler of course!,9,7 February 2006,"Adam Sandler is at it again! This time he's a simple waterboy who has the nads for football. All that rage that he kept bottled up, he really shows it. Bobby Boucher(Adam Sandler) lives in the Bayou with his mother, and he wants to make it well with the world. However, his Mama(Kathy Bates) is very protective, but not very sharp. She wouldn't let Bobby have fun, and that's not cool. She claims Bobby as her ""best friend"", but she's not very truthful. When Boucher goes to college, he get the opportunity to be educated and to play football. With rage like that, he's perfect. The Coach(Henry Winkler) has a great tattoo of Elvis on his posterior. But Bobby really opens up with a woman named Vicki(Fairuza Balk) who steals Lawrence Taylor's car, and reveals her feelings to Bobby Boucher. I liked the part where Vicki flashes her breasts to Boucher. That stuck on his mind very fast. Boucher uses all his cool wrestling movies on other football teams from the dropkick, to the power-bomb. He even pictured one of the football players as that mean Coach Red Beaulieu(Jerry Reed). After Mama sees Bobby's married, she learned one thing from Bobby: that ""spear of rage"" when her husband appears after leaving the family. A perfect solution for deadbeats. Sure beats a gun! Having hidden anger or hidden rage? ""The Waterboy"" is for you! Very funny, and highly entertaining. I liked it. Rating 3 out of 5 stars.",The Waterboy

It's dumb in an earnest and appealing way, with Sandler in his element as the dense, innocent hayseed with tons of peculiar charisma and an aggressively violent streak. He's undeniably the centerpiece of this story, but also isn't afraid to share the screen with the other denizens of this obtuse little world he's populated - a necessity, since a crippling stutter leaves him unable to complete more than a few sentences at a time. Kathy Bates and Henry Winkler unleash their wickedly funny hidden talents in supporting roles as Sandler's sanctimonious, over-protective mother and cowardly savant football coach, respectively. Though the SNL alum would later dip into the well too often, at this point his backup squad of one-note bit characters and bizarre non sequiturs still felt fresh and genuine. Loaded with buried gems and unexpectedly brilliant one-liners, it left me grinning and wiping tears from my eyes in several spots.

30,iquine,Perfect Story for a Silly Movie,8,13 September 2019,(Flash Review)What a crazy character. Do I dare say Waterboy is a deep character...? At least for a stupid comedy. Waterboy is a gentle soul who only wants to hydrate the local losing college football team as he has a crazed obsession for H2O. He has a ton of hidden aggression that once surfaces lands him on the team against his Mama's wishes. As an immediate successes he delivers oodles over the top brutal tackles with a hilarious sound. Can Waterboy help the team become winners? Sandler does a great job playing an unusual character. The movie is full of good-hearted and randomly funny scenes that'll leave you smiling.

31,Catherine_Grace_Zeh,"Excellent, gut-busting, in-your-face football comedy!",9,17 November 2005,"In my opinion, THE WATERBOY is an excellent, gut-busting, in-your-face football comedy! When I first saw this in the theaters as a part of my seventeenth birthday party seven years ago, everybody, including me, was rolling. I thought Adam Sandler was very hilarious as well as dazzling. When Captain Insano (Paul ""The Giant"" Wight) teased Bobby (Adam Sandler), I wanted to punch his lights out. This was because he was making fun of the fact that Bobby still lived with his mother (Kathy Bates). Vicki (Fairuza Balk) was very pretty and sexy in my opinion. The one character I couldn't understand was Farmer Fran (Blake Clark). This was because he mumbled when he talked. In conclusion, I thought THE WATERBOY was an excellent gut-busting, in-your-face football comedy. If you're a fan of Adam Sandler and you haven't seen this excellent, gut-busting, in-your-face football comedy, I HIGHLY recommend it! You're in for a lot of gut-busting laughs, so go to the video store, rent it or buy it, kick back with a friend, and watch it.",The Waterboy

Somewhere along the line though this hits this really fun spot of embracing the insanity without fully reaching the point of obnoxiousness. It's oddly impressive given how Sandler is playing an awkward character bordering on a unpleasant impression of a mental handicapped individual but there's something about this that's fun and I can't help but enjoy it.

36,breakdownthatfilm-blogspot-com,Not exactly smart but is fun,6,2 June 2015,"Adam Sandler has always been one of those known comedians to be grouped into the category of you either love him or you hate him. Very few audiences find him somewhere in the middle. After proving his comic ability on Saturday Night Live, Sandler began moving towards the movie business, getting into bigger and bigger projects. As for director Frank Coraci, it would not be until him, Sandler and writer Tim Herlihy met together to make The Wedding Singer (1998). From there, the three would pair up to make a number of future films. Of this list, this would be their second feature and probably second most respected of that bunch. According to many to be the 1990s highest grossing football game (until later films), this comedy isn't clever in a lot of ways but isn't completely void of laughs either.The story is about Southern son of Kathy Bates' momma's boy Bobby Boucher Jr. (Sandler) who gets nothing but disrespect by the people he tries to help stay hydrated. After being on the job serving beverages to Coach Beaulieu (Jerry Reed) and team for 18 years, Bobby gets fired. Looking to keep doing what he's good at, he finds Coach Klein (Henry Winkler), a coach who can't find a way to get his team to accomplish anything. Initially, no one respects Bobby's entrance but soon, they and Bobby discover that he has a knack for tackling others. With that, Bobby is recruited to play for the team as well, leading to unexpected results. For what was written, Tim Herlihy was competent in the construction of the story. All subplots are started and completed and the character develop is noticeable for certain individuals. Possibly the best message this movie sends to its audience is to always try and better yourself. It doesn't exactly come out and say that but watching Bobby progress as a character speaks that in some respects.The other enjoyable aspect to the writing is watching how Bobby's life begins to turn around. Initially Bobby doesn't have any friends except his mom (Kathy Bates). But as time goes on, the respect and size of Bobby's circle increases in diameter so much, it's hard not to like the guy. This leads to the performances and comedy. For both, it's half-and- half. Sandler as Bobby makes his character sound and act innocent (which is what makes him likable) but the way he goes about it is a slight bit obnoxious at points only because of how he talks. This involves a squealy voice that only can be made by the way Sandler shapes his mouth. Surely there could've been another way to make his role sound just as innocent without looking so obviously prepared. Seriously, nobody talks with their jaw in that position. But this is the least of silly comedy. Because the setting to this story takes place in the Southern States, a number of exaggerated stereotypes are used in order to make the viewers laugh. One example of this is making Bobby's mom full on rural, no education, alligator barbecuing, the devil is everything wackjob.Really? There's no problem portraying Southerners and accentuating their culture but there's no reason to be going over-the-top ridiculous about it to the point of absurd and deranged. Another example of this is the character Blake Clark plays, which is being a deep voice mumbler who nobody understands. Who the heck cares about this character? He's just wasting time. However there are other characters that make up for these overblown fabrications like Henry Winkler who's goofy in his right and Jerry Reed (his last role) as the anti-football coach for being nothing but greedy. Fairuza Balk (best know for playing Dorothy from Return to Oz (1985) who plays Bobby's love interest also has more of grounded personality than other Southern supporting characters. Even wrestler Paul Wight has a brief role that isn't as superfluous as it could have been made out to be.There's still a couple of things left to look at. Unfortunately the cinematography covered by Steven Bernstein isn't much of anything significant. Much of the shots taken are very plain looking with nothing that really grabs its viewers' attention. However, the football games are engaging but not because of the camera-work. This is based more on the how the game is played and how characters react and work together as a team. Even for the silly comedy that it is, the game still feels like there's something riding on it that can't be missed. Finally the music provided by Alan Pasqua (which is his last film composition thus far) worked when it needed to. There was no main theme or anything and much of his music was substituted for other well-known songs to help with the comedy. The only reason why his music is getting a pass is again going back to the football games. Although they were not intense and as engaging as the game, the tracks did help elevate the viewing experience.The story itself is written properly and the energetic football games are what this comedy really has to offer. The comedy works at times but the stereotyping and exaggerations do get overdone, especially when it comes to Southern culture. Thankfully, the main protagonist is portrayed in an innocent manner that allows it audience to at least like Adam Sandler's performance.",The Waterboy

38,mattymatt4ever,Another score for Sandler!,7,17 October 2001,"It's Adam Sandler.  Are we expecting a smart comedy, along the lines of Woody Allen and Albert Brooks?  Of course not.  But like all his comedies, it works.  Some of the jokes are truly lame (not in a funny way), but most of them worked.  Sandler helped pen the script, so naturally the humor is cheap and juvenile.  But everyone, young and old, has a kid or teenager inside of them that is dying to break out.  That explains the success of ""There's Something About Mary.""  I'm sure a movie with such widespread success didn't reach only a young audience.  When an old man dressed like Colonel Sanders gets hit in the head by a paperweight, call me immature, but I'm going to laugh out loud!  Sandler does a great job at awakening the kid in all of us.  It's truly evident that the kid in him is fully awakened. 
Honestly, I still prefer Sandler's ""Billy Madison"" (I will always love that movie!) and ""Happy Gilmore,"" but this is a good one too.  I never thought Fairuza Balk was hot, before checking out this film.  Anyone who has seen ""The Craft"" knows damn well she looked horrible!  And for good reason--she was playing a witch!  Here, she looks hot, and walks around in a lot of skimpy outfits--MMMM!  No matter how many times I watch this film, I can't help but crack up at Blake Clark as Farmer Fran.  God, what an underrated talent!  His main gag is you can't understand what the hell he's saying. Sure, it doesn't sound like much on paper--shows how the timing and execution of a joke can really work wonders.  He also made a short appearance in ""Joe Dirt,"" so look for him in that one as well.  There are a good deal of notable gags:  the Roy Orbison tattoo, Rob Schneider's ""You can do it!"" character, etc.  I can't say this is a subtle comedy that you'll want to check out over and over again to search for jokes you may have missed.  To tell the truth, I think the film gets more lame in further viewings.  Which is why it's good to watch it once or twice.  Don't wear it out, because this kind of comedy can wear out easily--like those supermarket brand AA batteries.  ""The Waterboy"" is funny, mindless entertainment.  I recommend watching it--just read a book afterwards...LOL.  Critics have criticized Sandler for lowering viewers' comic standards.  Sure, his gags may not be as intelligently crafted as those of the late Marx Brothers or Buster Keaton, but he knows how to make people laugh and I'm not going to fry him for that. Some don't find him funny--and if you don't, I understand.  But I'm not going to view Sandler as comedy's Hitler.  Believe me, I've seen much worse. My score:  7 (out of 10)",The Waterboy

Anyway it certainly, definitely, for sure isn't intelligent, so why bother.  I saw it on TV and was just stunned by the lack of everything that makes a movie, the only entertaining bit was seeing Cathy Bates in the most humiliating role of her distinguished career, if you are into that sort of thing.  And if that wasn't bad enough, it was actually a CLONE of an EARLIER, equally DISMAL, Adam Sandler flick (""Happy Gilmore""), only this time it's with football rather than golf, AND both movies were major box office hits!

Sandler works hard to make this character funny, but he saddles himself with that strange child-like voice that makes him hard to understand at times and eventually the character does start to grate on the nerves. There are a couple of very effective supporting performances from Kathy Bates as Sandler's over-protective mother and Henry Winkler, in the performance of his career, as the neurotic coach of the team, who has more than his share of personal hang-ups.

49,emm,Sandler is getting better at his movie career! For now.,6,18 April 1999,"Adam Sandler is finally starting to prove the world (and me included) that he is a downright likeable comic, even if his speech needs therapy. After his previous outings prior to THE WEDDING SINGER (I have not forgotten that one!), I had virtually no hope that THE WATERBOY could pull himself together in show business. Sorry to say I'm right, but Sandler is acceptable for an otherwise standard fare sports comedy. Whether you liked HAPPY GILMORE to the fullest or not, the  changes in Sandler's personality is sure enough to disappoint the most faithful fans. He stands out with far greater appeal set in an environment of Southern flavor, and while his usual hijinks continue in his series of movies to date, he's less childish and more calm than in the past. Still, he's got the potential to give us all a delightfully good time. ""Cartoonish"" can also describe this movie, with characters that add life to the comedy experience, including a welcome appearance by Henry ""The Fonz"" Winkler as a ""football"" coach.  It could even be the the perfect Sandler movie that pulls off a wacky cartoon episode, and it does well. THE WATERBOY still could have done much better, though. It could have toned down some of the objectionably crude matter that is mighty pointless for a cheerful movie, and it didn't have to be overused on typical comedy cliches that make it look similar to the rest.

It was a packed house when I first saw this, and the theater was exploding in laughter throughout. This happened when I went to see ""The Naked Gun"" movies. I love to go see laugh riot comedies in a filled-up theater. It's a great movie going experience. Anyway, Adam Sandler stars as Bobby Boucher, a waterboy for college football teams who has an unusual gift when it comes down to playing the sport. Sandler is funny; Henry Winkler is funny as Sandler's coach; Fairuza Balk is funny as Sandler's girlfriend; but the real scene stealer in the movie is the great Oscar-winning actress Kathy Bates as Sandler's mama. Bates gives a side-splittingly funny performance in this movie. What Bates does to that man at the end of this movie is a classic comedy scene. So what if critics hated this. Sit back and have a great laugh.**** (out of four)",The Waterboy
57,chrisbrown6453,"While not the funniest movie I've ever seen, The Waterboy had a lot of funny moments, all thanks to Adam Sandler.",7,19 June 2002,"There were a couple of slow moments, the humor was sophmoric at best, and the plot was simplistic, but it had me laughing almost all the way through. Adam Sandler plays Bobby Boucher, a waterboy for a college football team. He's a little, well, slow and the guys on the team make fun of him for it. The hard ass coach finally fires him, and Bobby is left without his favorite thing. Water. His mama (Kathy Bates) doesn't want Bobby anywhere but at home with her, but being 31, Bobby kind of doesn't want that anymore. So he heads to the worst college football team in the area, and the coach there, Coach Kline (Henry Winkler) hires him. Mind you, Coach Kline also talks to himself, but that's another story. While on the practice field, this new team starts picking on Bobby. Coach Kline tells him he needs to stick up for himself. To focus on his anger and fight back. And we all know what happens. Bobby almost kills the quarterback by spearing him in the open field. Coach Kline tells Bobby he needs to join the team. But Mrs. Boucher forbids Bobby to play football, so Bobby has to lie to her to play. So of course Bobby's team meets his old team in the big bowl game, and I think you can guess what happens. The plot is straight forward. Nice guy gets picked on, makes some new friends with his ""gift"" of being able to play football, his new friends who were once losers now become winners, and they all make it to the championship game. Sort of reminds me of The Mighty Ducks. The reason this movie is so funny, is Adam Sandler. I remember watching him when he first started his stand-up years ago, but I never thought he'd click with the country as well as he has. He has this childish charm about him, and you can't help but laugh when he's on screen. During the movie, whenever he'd let out his little scream before pummeling the opposing player, I'd start to laugh. I also laughed out loud at Henry Winkler's ass, but I'd have to say, the funniest scene to me was the one with Lawrence Taylor. LT is running a football camp, and he has Bobby come and speak. Bobby is still a little slow, and what he basically says is to tackle the guy with the ball. So LT looks at the kids, and says something like, ""and kids, this is another reason why you shouldn't smoke crack!"" I almost fell out of my chair laughing. Lawrence Taylor telling someone not to smoke crack. I don't think Sandler could have picked a better time to release this movie, seeing as how Taylor was arrested a couple weeks before for possession of Crack. Oh mercy... Anyway, the real key to this movie was Adam Sandler. Henry Winkler had a few funny scenes, but the rest of the cast didn't do much but set up Sandler. Kathy Bates as Mrs. Boucher was just a little annoying if nothing else. And Fairuza Balk (God bless her) as Bobby's love interest didn't do much for me either. Like I said before, the plot of the movie wasn't original, so it was the performances that would help this film along. And the performances weren't all that special either, it's just the way Adam Sandler is that makes the movie funny. So overall, I found The Waterboy laugh out loud funny. But if you don't like Adam Sandler, you're not going to like this movie.",The Waterboy
58,acedj,You can do it!,10,12 February 2020,"I know, I know. Does this movie really deserve a 10 you ask. well since reviews are subjective, I feel it does. If you'd care to read on, I shall endeavor to explain why.
Bobby Boucher is a mentally challenged young man that lives with his mother in the Louisiana bayou. His sole job in life is as the water-boy for the local college football team. This is a job he takes excessively serious. One day one of the players upsets Bobby and Bobby attacks him and gets fired. He begins a search for a new place to ply his unique skills and gets a new position, though working for free. Soon though the coach sees Bobby's rage attack and gets him enrolled in the college so he can play football. Keeping it a secret from his mother who would not approve, Bobby becomes not only successful at college, but a force beyond compare on the field, carrying the team to a bowl game.This movie works so well on every aspect. Adam Sandler has a few movies under his belt so his acting is vastly improved from his earlier movies. So I give this film 10 stars because it is my favorite of all his films. It is a movie I can watch over and over and still laugh. Great movie here for football fans and comedy fans alike.",The Waterboy

He brought a serious side to the whole college comedy theme (though more likably in contrast to the National Lampoon's Animal House film). It's so funny!",The Waterboy
61,rollernerd,Visualize and Attack,7,22 December 2020,"Welcome back to another edition of Adam's Reviews!! **queue in intro music**Tonight's movie review is the sports comedy The Waterboy (1998), where Adam Sandler plays Bobby Boucher, a 31-year-old mama's boy from the back bayous of a small town in Louisiana who is a massive fan of the WWE wrestle champ Captain Insano. Bobby is also the waterboy for the University of Louisiana Cougars until he is fired and ends up doing the same job for a down-and-out college team. Bobby is lonely and is constantly tormented for just being Bobby and never stands up for himself. That is until one day, Bobby discovers he has an insane tackling ability by channelling his anger and is picked in the team's defensive back line. This is one of Sandman's classic creations and has similarities to his SNL character ""Canteen Boy."" The film has plenty of weird funny moments and heaps of gags including Colonel Sanders and Bobby constantly opening cans of wooping ass. Sandler's Cajun accent and his socially awkward desire to ensure everyone is hydrated with clean and cold H2O, the film is entertaining from start till end. There is Henry ""The Fonz"" Winkler who plays Bobby's football coach, a guy with a terrible inferiority issue. Winkler has great moments in the film and a few funny lines. This includes the scene where before Bobby goes out to play, Winkler's character tells him that ""Water sucks, Gatorade is better,"" so that Bobby can use that anger on the field to tackle his opponents. To me the main star of the film is Bobby's mamma played by the awesome Kathy Bates, whose character believes foosball, women and Benjamin Franklin are the works of the devil. Bates has the best scenes in the movie as the possessive and manipulative mamma who wears apron strings and serves giant swamp snakes and jelly gators to her guests. Overall a classic Sandman flick 7/10",The Waterboy

It's about a waterboy named Bobby Boucher(Adam Sandler) who is sick of being treated like crap from the other football players and decides to join the football team himself. With the help of his gorgeous girlfriend Vicki(Fairuza Balk), Bobby can achieve anything. Also there is a very funny performance by Kathy Bates, who plays Bobby's Mother.

Adam Sandler does many similar kinds of roles and this is his repressed nerd character with powerful simmering rage at its essence. The scene where The Waterboy Bobby Boucher and is taught to release his rage and tackle a mocking football cohort is one of the most satisfying scenes in comedy. It truly is an uplifting and complete moment, and also very funny. The scenes that stand out for me in Adam Sandler films are similar in that they have both humor and a wholesome, cathartic quality, and this scene is one of the very best.There's a number of people who could be on steroids in this film (not actually, but in their characters and actions) and then others who play the oddball wimps, and then you get Sandler's Bobby Boucher who is a bit of both. The characters are amped up and as they should be for a comedy, and especially the actress who plays Bobby's mother and the Unisinkable Molly Brown in Titanic, she is satisfying.Just a perfect and well made classic comedy that everyone who has ever felt like an underdog should watch.",The Waterboy

They just love his dumb-ass movies. The movie centres around the local water boy who when the coach of the football team notices he can tackle hard when mad he puts him as the new quarterback of tackeler guy sorry I am Australian. The movie is good on many pointers as it shows that Adam Sandler can play 2 different types of dumb guys, nice dumb and guys and mean dumb guys.

I can't even say that it was a waste of money because it was a huge hit.  Sandler and his cronies have actually stolen our money with this mindless piece of crap.  I know critics are rough on Sandler's films. WEDDING SINGER was actually a good flick that poked fun at the 1980's and why not?  The 80's are an open wound that WEDDING SINGER exposed with hilarity.  It even developed a half-decent love story with the help of Drew Barrymore.  What the hell happened with this?  Did they think this was funny while they were making it or was it in post-production when they realized that it sucked?  Sandler is too talented to think this was any good.  The public bought it.  Why?  We'll never know.I saw it on video, so thank God I did not pay $7.50 for a theater run. After watching it, I didn't even want it in the house overnight.  Sandler and his funny buddies, who get paid handsomely to make this garbage, go after the deep south for laughs.  You get the impression that every person in cajun Louisiana is dirty and stupid.  They can't be any dumber than the writers of this dud.  The filmmakers, and I use this term loosely, have no knowledge of the sport of football.  It is absolutely painful to sit through.I know some people will read this and say I am too analytical or that I did not ""suspend my disbelief"" enough to enjoy this debacle.  Get real. ""Bobby Bouche"" is boring, and a good ending would've been for him to drown in the Gulf of Mexico with a football in his mouth.   (-1 of 10)",The Waterboy

The Waterboy is not going to win any awards or even make its audience think, but it will inspire some laughs if you let it. As for it being similar to Happy Gilmour, you might as well say that it is identical to half of the movies produced in Hollywood - unlikely hero comes good, gets faced with a difficult challenge, overcomes it an wins the game in the last few minutes!

These are just a few of my favorite Adams Sandler films, and his best may I add. But some people consider The Waterboy Sandlers best film ever. Well I'm sorry but I beg to differ. Sandler plays Bobby Boucher Jr. who is considered an idiot because of his annoying accent and slow mind. His devil hating mama pampers him too much and he just got fired from his job as water boy distributer from a big college football team. Bobby then becomes the new water boy for the worst college football team ever The Mud Dogs, being coached by mentally broken down Coach Klien played by Henry Winkler. Bobby gets insulted by his new team mates only for the coach to tell him to stand up for himself. Bobby then pictures the people who has made fun of him in his life on his targets shoulders and tackles them to the ground! Thanks to Bobby's anger tackles, he becomes a tackler for the Mud Dogs and leads them to the Burbon Bowl. Problem is along the way, his momma goes into the hospital with a ""broken"" heart, Bobby's jail bird girlfriend disrespects him, and his old football team are the ones who will be facing him at the Bowl. What will Bobby do?I'm not saying this is a bad movie but it is totally off from a great movie. One main problem with the movie is Sandler himself. He does a great job as Bobby except his characters accent (which is more of a stutter, whine, scream, and mentally retarded yelp rolled into one) makes your eardrums cringe every time he speaks. It gets so annoying after half the film that you just can't wait for the movie to pick up the pace and be over with. But if you really get past the voice and look beyond the dumb atmosphere, you fall right into the movie and really enjoy it.Now Sandler isn't the only character that makes the film ""dumb."" Every character in this movie is like a rejected Bugs Bunny cartoon character refused to be shown on cable broadcast. First there's Bobby with his nails on a chalk board voice, Coach Klien who likes acting retarded every time he has a bad play thrown, evil Coach Red who is just a stupid jerk, Farmer Fran the assistant coach who is nothing but a dumb Amish farmer who can't even speak right, Mama Boucher who's devil hating persona falls to the ground only after three minutes of depth, Rob Schnider as his classic Townie character who shout's nothing but ""You can do it!"", and of coarse we have Vickie Valencourt, Bobby's love interest, but she isn't really needed in the movie. Sure she's a nice piece of cast decoration but her character is so annoying. She's a criminal, psychic, and murderer wrapped into one body and the only time she does anything good is to help Bobby at the big football bowl game in some stupid plot turn that only last a mere thirty seconds.The jokes are real cornball but in a good way. With all the football moments and hard tackling, the jokes are pretty low tack. The special effects are just plane bad looking when Bobby pictures his anger on people's shoulders and the coach pictures babies and pooches. Also the whole football team are nothing but big babies wearing jerseys. One is a dumb playboy, another is a dim witted Frankenstein, another seems like a gay punter who likes to picture KKK members heads on his football before he kicks em', it just gets so stupid after a while. You even get tired of watching this movie all the way up to the big bowl game at the end of the film after seeing all the really bad jokes and seeing Bobby tackle so many people for some stupid reason. Like in one scene, he tackles his professor for saying his mama was wrong about what makes an alligator so meanWhat the Waterboy is though is a good time slot filler. If you just want a slow paced dumb comedy, sure you will get a kick out of it. Like I said, it's not a bad movie but it's too stupid and corny just to take seriously. I enjoyed it a little so maybe you could too. I give the Waterboy a 6. If you want Classic Sandler, get Happy Gilmore or Billy Madison. If you want Sandler's second to rate cornball comedies, get this. I still say Happy Gilmore was his best. The Waterboy= C+",The Waterboy

I on the other hand found them distanced from each other for the following reasons:-No annoying accent in Happy Gilmore -No fight scene with Bob Barker in Waterboy -No annoying rednecks in Happy Gilmore -Both movies deal with different sports -Sandler's characters in the two movies are complete oppositesThe movie was clearly aimed at the pre-teen age group with it's potty and no-brainer humor.

Don't look for a great story, interesting performances or even wonderful cinematography because that is not what the producers intended.

After all, any football fan would realize that the tackles made by the 180? lb waterboy wouldn't inflict damage on people much larger than he. Sure, even his accent is awful, but it is there to make you laugh.Kathy Bates had the only good performance in this movie as ""Mama"", the overprotective mother of Bobby Boucher (Sandler). Henry Winkler gives an acceptable performance, although it always seems as if he really doesn't want to be in this movie.There are many funny gags that will make you laugh, albeit not like those in ""There's Something About Mary"", but still generally well done. Sandler probably could have done more than rely an his accent, stuttering and outright belief in every word his Mama says to make this a better movie. Look for Rob Schneider with a line that is funny the first two times, however, loses its affect the other ten times he says it. Also look for Clint Howard as ""Paco"".The Waterboy has nothing on Sandler's last film ""The Wedding Singer"", but we all need our break every now and then, don't we?

Most of the reviews for this movie tend to say what I thought after watching this movie...they say it's bad. I couldn't stand Adam Sandler's accent, it annoyed me so much I felt like screaming at him. Why did Kathy Bates have to lower herself and appear in this crap. She was so good in Misery, and to then go and do this to her credibility...now her credibility has lowered about 50%.

95,kittiwake-1,the reason it gets only a 7,7,8 November 2006,"Great movie. I enjoyed the plot very much. The characterizations were very funny and well-done. Only problem with this movie was Henry Winkler. I felt he did not give a good performance. The more I watch the movie, however, the more I realize maybe it was the script itself or bad casting. The role, I felt, just didn't fit Henry Winkler. (I don't have any recommendations for who would fit the role, however.) My mother hated this movie. The Waterboy is what some people call ""slow"". She is a teacher and couldn't stand to see what appeared to be a very stupid man as the star of the movie. (Yep, she hated Forrest Gump, too...) I, however, enjoyed his ignorant innocence. Naivete, if you will. I highly recommend that moms show this movie to their daughters. Any mom who acts like Kathy Bates's character, RUN. My ex-mother-in-law really loved the mom in this movie. (Hence the ""ex"".) Overbearing moms are a sure sign that something is wrong with your man. Great life lesson in an Adam Sandler film: I like it! Some parts were corny. But I can deal with corny. My dad's from Ohio. I was raised with corny. I recommend this one to people who like Adam Sandler, who like Kathy Bates, or who have ever been ""the underdog"". Great with popcorn. Great with friends. Watch it before your kids see it, though. Adult themes. Have fun!",The Waterboy

Jokes that would have received heckling if the main characters had been standup comedians! And the most annoying factor of this film was SANDLER'S voice. Can somewhere care to explain to me the humor in pretending to speak like a squirmy nebbish!? Yes, you have two schools of comedic films. CEREBRAL and SLAPSTICK. e.g. WOODY ALLEN would be considered a cerebral comedic genius. Both in writing, acting, and directing. MEL BROOKS would fall into the latter gener of SLAPSTICK. But for God sakes, their films are funny!! Now I know why THE WATERBOY was written by SANDLER'S college buddies! Because the end result looks like a COLLEGE FILM SHORT! Unfortunately, the duration of the film wasn't as concise!  Remember, revenues never equates to QUALITY!!

100,edge547,Forrest Gump meets Gilbert Grape,6,5 May 2017,"The Waterboy is a dumb comedy that plays like a cross between Forrest Gump and What's Eating Gilbert Grape, seasoned with Adam Sandler's inimitable silliness. Like Forrest Gump, it's about a ""slow"" southern man whose athletic potential is one day noticed by a college football coach who goes on to recruit him for the team. Like Gilbert Grape, it's about a young man who is trapped in his family home taking care of his overweight mother, played here by the lovely and iconic Kathy Bates.The plot for The Waterboy is decidedly silly, and that's by design. But it's no sillier than a typical Hollywood film; the only difference here is that the filmmakers were aware of the absurdity, and that's what is good about it. Everybody's in on the joke. It's about a young man, played by Adam Sandler, who is a dedicated waterboy, serving the players of a college football team for years and without any thanks. He endures much torment from the team members and coach, who constantly ridicule him, and one day he is fired. The coach for the opposing team—played by Henry Winkler in his finest and most hilarious role—recruits him first as a waterboy and then as a linebacker, despite his mother's wishes.He has an extraordinary ability to tackle opponents, due to the anger that has built up within him from years of verbal abuse. But he can only tackle them if he is mad at them, so he imagines the faces of his tormentors on the players of the opposing team. At first he imagines the evil head coach of the team who fired him, then later the players who bullied him, and eventually his own overbearing mother.Like most of Sandler's comedies, the story is of course stitched together with tons of jokes, which are sometimes corny, sometimes hilarious, always ridiculous, and very often extremely quotable. This is perhaps the most quotable of Adam Sandler's films, and for that reason it is one of the most memorable. I watched it once or twice the year it came out and never saw it again until eighteen and a half years later, but I still remembered so many of the lines.My favorite is when the waterboy's coach tells him, right before a play, ""Water sucks. Gatorade is better."" He tells him to use the anger that he feels in hearing that statement on the field to tackle opponents. It's a simple line, and seems like a corny joke at first, but it's actually on of cinema's most hilarious lines for so many reasons.It's hilarious because up until then, the waterboy had been using his deep-seated anger to bring out his rage on the field. But then we see him do just as well based on an insult that his own kindhearted coach mutters to him moments before he steps onto the field, despite the fact that the waterboy himself must know he doesn't really mean it, and in an instant comically trivializing all of the waterboy's abuse that had been built up until that point. It's hilarious that someone would be so personally offended by such a claim about water. And it's hilarious because we all know that water doesn't suck, as it's necessary for survival. The levels of humor are so subtle that one could easily miss them, but they're there. It almost makes me wonder if perhaps ever the writers didn't pick up on them.",The Waterboy

Adam has done it before in Happy Gilmore, Billy Madison...etc. and he will do it again in Little Nicky, Mr. Deeds, Big Daddy.All in all this is far from one of his best films and far from one of his worst.

If you liked any of the films mentioned in the paragraph above then you will like this one as it basically the same movie.The high point in the film are Kathy Bates as the over protective mother.

Well, they said that I should see something different.  They (friends) came out laughing with huge smiles on their faces, saying how totally hilarious the movie was.  I, on the other hand, was a bit puzzled as to what they were laughing so hard about.  I laughed at some of the scenes, and the movie does come off as entertaining, but was it really that good?

Why even Adam Sandler would get involved with this picture, is beyond me. He has done some good work. I thought that Billy Madison and Happy Gilmore were hilarious. But The Waterboy was just so childish and infantile, it was unbearable. I was honestly surprised that I was able to make it through the entire film without walking out.

108,spirit11,Adam Sandler can be funny without being disgusting!,6,5 September 2000,"This is my first Adam Sandler movie, and I was pleasantly surprised. Expecting atrocious language and gratuitous sexual remarks, instead the movie focused on a shy young man who finally breaks free of the verbal and physical abuse the bullies of the world have heaped on him all his life.There are some hilariously crazy bits, such as when Kathy Bates who plays Sandler's mother in the film, when asked what is for desert for a meal she has cooked, hears the sound of a small animal striking the bug zapper outside and responds, ""Squirrel.""If you've ever been the runt of the class, picked on mercilessly, and wanted to fight back but didn't know how, you'll cheer Sandler's character on as he finally stands up for himself. If you've ever been the bully in that same situation, shame on you! ""Mama says"" you shouldn't be a bully.The storyline is uplifting, Sandler's lisp and speech patterns are wonderful, and the cast overall does a great job. It looks as if everyone on the movie was just plain having fun.Let's see -- virtually no language, minimal sophomoric humor, genuinely funny writing, no sex (even the sexual humor is kept relatively minimal) drive the PG-13 rating.

It could have been because I wasn't with my friends this time, but I doubt it.I guess what I'm trying to say is that it kind of ran out of steam for me.

It's as if the audience is intended to hate this movie, and to love hating it. The characters and situations are unbelievable and cartoony, but they are obviously supposed to be that way.

Don't get me wrong, the movie has an abundance of laughs, but it seems as if many of them fell short of total hilariousness.  A lot of the comedy was physical, and not vocal.  That's okay, if you're a physical comedy fan, but Adam Sandler tackling everything viciously can be a bit repetitive. I recommend this movie to anybody who likes physical comedy.

121,bradleyadita,Caramel Apple Sugar Babies,5,25 October 2007,"Evidently this is how Fairuza Balk spent the other part of 1998 when she was not playing the ravenous lust-life of Edward Norton's character in the provocative American History X. Hundreds of miles away from the skinhead battles on the streets of L.A., Adam Sandler was busying himself as first-time executive producer in the state of LA. The film which transpired, The Waterboy, is a good effort but leaves much to be desired when put up against the compendium of Sandler films.Given hindsight, the film's impressive financial success was more of an indication of Sandler's rising notoriety as first-rate deliverer of comedy, and less due to merits of this particular film. Sandler's characters usually rely on some aspect of discomfort, and Bobby Boucher (Boo-SHAY) seems to specialize in this trait. We never know what the true nature of his affliction is. Yet his disconcerting speech and mannerisms begin to normalize upon meeting the other members of Bobby's community which include; a near-psychotic 3rd Division football coach (played by Henry Winkler, The FONZ, that's right here he has completely ""jumped the shark""), a tattooed tough-skinned feline fem-friend Vicki Vallencourt (Fairuza Balk), an assorted crew of deranged football teammates, legions of local bumpkins who hobble onto the screen as if they came out of a George Romero flick including an aged Clint Howard (Eaglebauer from RnRHS), and Rob Schnider's character from whence originated the catchphrase, ""You can do it!"" (I always wondered where that came from), and lastly, but not to be forgotten, the hyper-protective overbearing near socio-phobe ""Momma"" (played by a Kathy Bates, yes the ""misery"" continues).The laughs are too few and too far between as the viewer plods through the Louisiana bayou in search of the plot. This film may have faired better amongst the jock set, but even they are evidently included in the film's low IMDb rating. What may have been Adam Sandler's answer to the call of Jim Carrey's Ace Ventura: Pet Detective, instead amounted to a mediocre addition to the Sandler curriculum vitae.",The Waterboy

Being from the UK however I found many parts of the film amusing at least to watch but seldom was i left in stitches.

I think he is capable of so much, too, and that is why, with the success of the film at the box office, I really wanted to like the Waterboy, and I expected so much, especially with co-stars like Winkler, Bates, and Balk. To their credits, the acting was full-caliber, but the story, I repeat, the story, just didn't do it for me. I didn't have pathos for the characters, and the Hollywood events and ultra-Hollywood ending just clenched my disappointment with it. I don't discredit Sandler's writing, for it has been of decent quality in the past (CDs and SNL, particularly), and I imagine it will be, again. Being an amateur writer, myself, one, on occasion, is prone to churn out an inferior script. I however, would like to take the opportunity to praise Sandler and offer advice for him, should his eyes ever come across this.Like Dan Aykroyd or Mike Myers, a dramatic role would serve Sandler well, for I believe that he would be able to nail such a thing (the film, 'Bulletproof', offered a sample, as small as it was, of his ability to perform in a generally non-comedic role). I certainly hope that he considers any future dramatic opportunity, for from him, I have seen genuine conveyances of anger, joy, and sadness in his acting. I think Sandler has the potential for, not just stardom, but monumental greatness, so please, no death threats. Loved the actors, liked the look, didn't like the writing. Sorry.",The Waterboy

The plot is the typical rags to riches rise of a small town football team thanks to a freak player. Disney usually makes these with an animal or girl as the unusual player, but in this case it's Adam Sandler. The character development is almost non-existent, with most of the ""key"" characters doing little more than keeping the ""plot"" moving along, and contributing to the funny scenes. Despite all this, it somehow manages to be laugh-out-loud funny for most of the movie. Once the slapstick element is introduced (and you've all seen the trailers, he gets mad, he tackles people) it is mercilessly applied over and over. The constant re-application of the humor somehow survives the rest of the movie, and through a few typical and unsurprising twists, we arrive at the end wanting to see it again.",The Waterboy

I know hismovies are monumentally stupid but I find myself laughing myhead off. And if you look closely, the predictability of theirstructure and exaggeration of genre conventions... in 'Waterboy', there's a barely detectable jab at the sort ofhackneyed clichés that form most of 'Good Will Hunting' or'Rudy'... you find a bit of a wry satirical edge below thegoofy, affable surface. In the case of 'Waterboy', Sandler'sover-the-top Cajun charicature is eclipsed by Kathy Bates whonails the accent on the head from the first ""Come give yo mama akee-yus"". Sandler is not in the top form of 'Happy Gilmore',mostly deprived of his characteristic temper tantrums, butBates, along with a great group of supporting archetypes, somehilarious flashbacks (Winkler sports a humongous afro in hisdream 70s pad), another well chosen soundtrack, and some greatphysical comedy on the field pick up whatever slack there is.

He goes on to become the waterboy for the worst college football team in history, and as soon as the abuse starts the coach (played by Henry Winkler) tells him to stand up for himself. He then visualizes his aggression and tackles the quarterback, knocking him out cold. This is the basis for the rest of the movie. Totally stupid, but also hilarious.

This 31 year old mama's boy delights locals and wins over the nation by making vicious, violent hits against major college players.  I especially liked how his character is a linebacker, instead of an offensive player, because it provides an even more unrealistic twist.

How the waterboy ever survived to adulthood and allowed near any part of society by his overprotective mother is a miracle? He saves the Mud Dogs from cutting their football program by some anger controlling methods that work wonders for his sports talents. He needed to be angry his whole life I think. Anyway I liked the mothers native cooking of snakes, alligators, and anything else she found in the swamp.

This movie shows Sandlers' truly annoying side.If you're going to see The Waterboy because of the physical hits don't bother. I didn't see ONE hit in the movie that they didn't show on TV.

In Happy Gilmore, Sandler used comedy techniques that have been effective in the past, yet made them his own, with new, fresh ways of executing them. Look at the classic scene with Chevy Chase in Christmas Vacation, where he goes off for a couple minutes screaming and cussing out his boss. Compare that to Sandler when he was screaming at the golf ball for 'not liking his home' and going in the hole. Essentially the same, but Sandler does a better job. Now, in the Waterboy, there ARE some new comedic strategies, and yes, a couple of them are pulled off well, but others fall flat and are just not funny at all. To make things worse, most of the funny parts were shown in the commercials, so when you see them on screen, you know what's coming, and aren't that interested. Overall, I did think this movie was worth the $4 matinee price, but would not be worth the regular $8, the characters weren't interesting enough, and the humour just wasn't frequent or funny enough.",The Waterboy

This one however shines a whole new light on him as a very talented actor and a comedic genius! His character, Bobby, is somewhat mentally challenged and has several emotional issues, and it's astounding how Sandler is able to portray both the tragedy of this character while remaining continuously funny throughout the entire movie!

Someone explain that fad to me: teens and people in their early 20's liking preschooler fare.Just like Farley and Spade, Sandler left SNL, where he actually was funny, and succumbed to making easy-laugh bile on film. The only SNL'er that left for the big screen and actually has continually made the most of it is Mike Myers.

It was by turn predictable, boring, badly acted,irritating - and that was just Sandler (who is without a doubt the most over-rated and least talented ""comedians"" I've ever had to suffer through).  Don't get me wrong, I have nothing against moronic or vulgar humour, but only if it is funny and this certainly isn't.Why Sandler is so popular is a complete mystery to me, he can't act (unlessdoing a bad voice impression of Eric Cartman from South Park counts as acting nowadays), he has no discernable writing ability or comic timing.

You'll never see him starring opposite Anthony Hopkins or Merryl Streep.  Okay, I realize his IS cast opposite Oscar-Winner Kathy Bates, but don't confuse me with details. This movie is just a bunch of jokes wrapped around a weak plot.Still, the jokes are really funny.  I don't usually laugh out loud at the movies, but I guffawed at many parts of this movie.  If nothing else, it stimulates the Three Stooges area of the frontal lobe of your brain.On the down side, Rob Schneider must be a good friend, because his role was obviously a last-minute toss in.  Schneider is not funny in this movie and his ""lines"" are by far the campiest element of this movie.Still, it was amazing how the crowd with which I saw it reacted to the football scenes in the movie.  I looked around and everyone was anxious or cheering like they're best friend was playing in the Super Bowl.  Also, this is the hardest I've seen an audience laugh since ""There's Something About Mary"".In short, if you can accept the fact that the plot is completely unbelievable and just watch it for laughs, you will enjoy this movie.

201,Leppy,Unfunny cliched comedy,1,11 November 1998,"The trailers for 'The Waterboy' misled me into thinking it would be a slightly superior comedy.  Now I know why.  As is the usual formula with these type of movies, the only good joke was shown in the trailer.  The mention of eating a snake's knee at dinner was hilarious but the rest of the film is boring, predictable and unfunny.'The Waterboy' is the story of a retarded 31-year old man (Adam Sandler), completely dominated by his extremely eccentric cajun mother (Kathy Bates). His name is Bobby Boucher and he loves his job as a waterboy for a Louisiana college football team that constantly bully and make fun of him.  When he gets fired by their nasty coach he volunteers for the job of waterboy with a totally inept team that haven't won a game in years.  Their coach (Henry Winkler) is a little odd which gives us a few light laughs throughout.  He's also had an ongoing feud of sorts for years with the nasty coach of the other team (yawn). The reason for the feud has left Henry Winkler's character with football coach impotency.Although the new team also bully and make fun of Bobby, we know by now that 'The Waterboy' will follow the usual cliche and he will somehow turn the team's fortunes around.  The new team discovers he's a brilliant tackler. Because of Bobby, the team reverses its losing streak and realises that bullying him is not a nice thing to do.  In the meantime, he falls in love with a beautiful girl who's crazy about him, his mother becomes normal and the wimpy coach reclaims his manhood.  What's more, every bit-character we've seen helps with whatever needs to be done in their own unique, quirky way.Sandler plays his character with a very irritating lisp and sticks his jaw out to emphasize his retardedness.  I was reminded of Billy Bob Thornton in 'Slingblade'.  It seems Hollywood will never tire of reminding us that no matter how dumb we are; as long as we're kind, caring and honest we'll succeed in this life and make the world a better place to live.  Nice idea but I'm sick of it.I will say that there are a lot of excellent tackling scenes.  I winced every time.  See this movie if you absolutely adore Adam Sandler.

205,Eliza-5,Waterboy hits bottom of the barrel with this swamp-water slosh,1,19 November 1998,"You can mess with him, but don't mess with his water! Mild-mannered Mama's-Boy gets his wish & wins for the football team with his unique tackling ability in this rambling, idiotic, formula movie. Adam Sandler plays Bobby Bouchet, the lowly 31-year-old waterboy for a college football team that constantly terrorize him until he is fired by the mean-spirited coach. Another coach, played by Henry Winkler, from a rival team, discovers Bobby's amazing ability to tackle players much larger than him. Bobby pretends they are people who have teased him and made him angry.Bobby is seduced by a local girl, much against his mother's wishes, and goes on to defy Mama by playing foos-ball, as she calls it, and becoming the star of the team. Just as the final game is to be played, his Mama discovers that Bobby has been playing ball, and fakes illness so that Bobby gives up football to be by her side. He promises to never leave her again, until the entire town and his football team comes to beg him to play and to apologize for making fun of him. His overprotective Mama, played beautifully by Kathy Bates, finally realizes the error of her ways and encourages him to play in the last game. Naturally, the team wins through Bobby's efforts, he gets the girl and all live happily ever after. This is the story of Bobby Bouchet, who is an unlikely protagonist. His problems are that he is disrespected by the team and others, and that he is the weak-willed victim of an overly-protective mother. He changes and becomes a hero by pretending he sees his enemies heads, jeering at him, on the bodies of the rival football team or in college instructors, tackling them, and finally realizing that he is a capable man and can succeed despite his mother. It takes the efforts of a sympathetic, and equally fearful coach, and a seductive young woman's love for Bobby to help him, and his Mama, see the light. The end of Act I is when the coach (Winkler) encourages Bobby to stand up for himself, and Bobby tackles a football player, knocking him down for the first time, which leads to the rest of this ridiculous story. Some of the secondary characters in this film are the two coaches: the good guy and the bad guy; the girl who is both good and bad; Bobby's black friend on the team; the townies; the Colonel Sanders look-alike professor, a bunch of drunken cheerleaders; the rival football team who are made up for the most part of real professional football players; and the members of Bobby's team. Set-ups/payoffs-reversals in this film include: Bobby visualizes enemies/ tackles whomever he needs to (pay-off); the girl fixes the lawn mower Bobby rides on/Bobby speeds off down the road on souped-up mower (pay-off); the team celebrating potential to win game/Coach informs Bobby that he can't play, due to faked HS diploma (reversal). The major conflicts for the protagonist are that  he wants to get away from clutches of his over-protective mother; he loves the girl, but is afraid to antagonize his mother; and he wants to go to college but feels he is too stupid to do so William Goldman1s theory about the 1st 15 pages & last 15 minutes are evidenced in this film, in that the first 15 minutes/pages do get immediately into the set-up of the story and introduce the protagonist, showing his problems and sucking the audience in to that story & hoping he'll win, over these conflicts. There are also some comedic moments, which make some audience members laugh. In the last fifteen minutes, all is resolved to the audience1s expectations, with a few surprises and additional laughs aimed at an unsophisticated audience, which satisfy the requirements of Goldman's theory by making the last 15 minutes as important as the first 15 minutes. There are many 3movie-moments2 in this film, some funny scenes and others just visual gags, like Bobby visualizing the head of various enemies, such as his mother, or  the mean coach on the body of rival football players, then tackling them; the donkey drinking out of the toilet bowl; the girl seducing Bobby, while his mother sleeps; and the scene of Bobby defying his mother and going to play football are just a few of the movie-moments that make this film a ""hit"" among the biggest movie-going crowd: young men aged 16-24 and their dates. Several ""rules"" from Goldman's book, ""Adventures in the Screen Trade"" are used in Waterboy, and perhaps used to excess: make 'em laugh, meet audience expectations for believability, show rather than tell, give them a happy ending, thus proving that dreams do come true, populate the story with many antagonists and make those antagonists as strong as the protagonist, make the protagonist a sympathetic character, make his or her problems multiple, give the protagonist deep conflicts, have a love interest, and give the star the best lines of dialog. The story is weak and sophomoric; the jokes and sight-gags are not funny, for the most part; one knows the ending within the first few minutes; and the dialog is about the worst-written I have ever experienced in a film. ""Simple, down-trodden hometown boy, much in thrall to evil witch of a mother defies her and becomes local hero who wins for the team and gets the girl"" is not this viewer1s idea of a clever or enlightening screenplay or film. It was pure torture to sit through, especially being forced to listen to Adam Sandler's ridiculous lines given in a stupid and virtually unintelligible and geeky accent. The only real strength of this film lies in the characterization of Mama and her lines of dialog, as well as her eventual realization of what she has done to her son. Her story is at least interesting and well-thought-out, almost as if it had been written by a different screenwriter. The rest of the people in the story have no real depth of character, and are flat caricatures of commonly-held stereotypes. I'd advise against spending money to see this film...wait for the video to come out and go rent it only to see the character of Mama, if you can get through the rest of the dreck in Waterboy. There's not much genuinely funny about this movie, and it definitely is a waste of time.",The Waterboy

I came out of the cinema with the muscles in my face hurting as a result of extensive laughing. And mind you, I was going through a bout of depression then, and my final exams was just around the corner!Sandler is excellent as the Forrest-Gumpish Bobby Boucher, though far from being an Academy Award candidate, but hey, it is suppossed to be a comedy, and who cares about the quality of his acting. The movie does not try to be funny all the time, and manages to avoid cheap and unfunny slapsticks. You can feel the confidence of the scriptwriter of the strengths of its script. Henry Winkler and Kathy Bates gave good performances, and gives the cast the extra dimension that any comedy needs. The movie does not focus too much on the plight of Bobby Boucher, as is the case in Happy Gilmore, thus making the plot of The Waterboy more varied.

If only he had kept these type of films up rather than featuring in films such as 'Mr Deeds' and 'Click' (which in my personal opinion have dragged him down some what!) he would be up there with the likes of Will Ferrel). The film in itself is an odd one but utterly enjoyable. Its always good to see a film where zero becomes the hero.

I even think that watching Happy Gilmore is a good way to waste 1.5 hours. But, and I mean but with a capital b, the Waterboy really stinks. I don't know what other people think but when I see Adam Sandler sticking out his chin and talking like a retard, I don't exactly burst into laugh.

226,Lauren-9,"Not high art, but a fun and enjoyable movie",8,18 November 1998,"This movie was not intended for people who don't enjoy Adam Sandler's brand of humor.  I felt that fact was clearly presented in all of it's advertising.  I think the people who didn't know what they were going to see in the first place live in a cave or something.  The other people who went to see it and hated it, probably went there intending to hate it.Overall, the movie was a continuation of the kind of humor we saw in Billy Madison, Adam Sandler doing his thing.  He does it well.  As always, the supporting cast was stellar.  Jerry Reed and the incredible Kathy Bates are outstanding.  Unlike many movies set in Louisiana, the accents were not atrocious(see The Big Easy for that)but a playful approach to the Cajun accent.  I thought it was a little over art directed in places, but not distractingly so.I am not a college kid, or Adam Sandler's biggest fan, but I went to see this movie to laugh and I did.",The Waterboy

237,m-23592,Waterboy review,5,22 January 2020,"This comedy starts off very intriguing and hilarious. I usually don't laugh out loud, but this movie had me laughing almost every minute the first half an hour. The movie starts out with Bobby Boucher, a 31 year old man, serving as a waterboy for a championship college football team. The football team pesters him any chance they get and they enjoy busting up his 'water system'. He obviously has some disabilities as his voice is extremely high and he has a vocal stutter and a lisp; and he's a 31 year old man who still lives with his mom (Helen Boucher or as Bobby calls him, 'mama'). Him living with his mom does not really help him at all as 'mama' seems to give him useless information that often makes him look more simple-minded and stupid. Bobby ends up getting fired as the waterboy on the championship team and he has nothing else to do so he becomes the waterboy for a losing rival team; by losing I mean a 40-game losing streak. Bobby finds some similarities with this new coach (Coach Klein) as he is shy and not demanding like the old coach. At practice one day, the quarterback decides to run a play where one of the receivers runs a very wide route; so wide, in fact, that he knocks down Bobby and his water station. Coach Klein convinces Bobby to stand up for himself so during the next play Bobby releases all his anger and unleashes a spectacular tackle on the quarterback. The coach decides to put him in the lineup on the football team as middle linebacker because of his amazing tackle. This is where I start to realize where this movie is going and I kind of lose interest. It starts to become very predictable and starts to become a stereotypical sports comedy movie; where there is someone who gets made fun of until they come off the bench and start playing and everyone sees how great they are. This is exactly what happens as Bobby turns out to be an amazing linebacker who helps break the teams' 40-game losing streak, eventually bringing them to the championship which is, not surprisingly, against his former team. Bobby helps his new team win the championship and he is the big hero. The other problem I find with this movie is how it may offend people with disabilities. As I said earlier, I was laughing non-stop at the start of the movie, but as the movie progressed I realized how offensive this movie could be for people with disabilities like Bobby. In the movie he portrayed as a simple-minded fool who can't converse with anyone, has no friends, and still lives with his mom at 31. This might offend lots of people as the movie is basically saying that disabled people are worthless unless they do something amazing for the community; like help a football team win a championship, for example. Overall, I think this movie can be funny for younger people, but it is far too predictable to be enjoyed by the majority of adults and older teens. I don't think it is the best movie for young kids, anyway, as it might blur their opinion on disabled people and make them think that there is no place for them in society.",The Waterboy

239,brilliantblue,great timing,9,24 January 2007,"for some reason this is one of my favorite movies. the timing is great. i've seen some movies that were potentially funnier but the editing/timing was off. but here the humor is only magnified. occasional tired spots do exist, but they only help to set up some hilarious physical comedy and gleefully goofy dialog. and Sandler's character occasionally makes me tear up with such a weird vulnerability (like his ""lunchlady land"" song). Kathy Bates does a great job playing his mother, and Fairuza Balk's Becky Ballencort is sinfully sexy. best of all is Henry Winkler's Coach Kline, though i can't tell if its really his character or just the contrast of his character to the Fonz character that I grew up with. Regardless, this movie cracks me up.",The Waterboy

Within a few minutes I realised it was a terrible film, with many aspects based on Forest Gump. It isn't in the slightest bit funny. I would've went home within 15 minutes of the film starting, but I wasn't the one driving, so sat for what felt like an age, to the very end, tormenting myself to the point of delirium. If anyone tries to tell me this film is worth watching, I will have no hesitation in challenging them to a stand-up fight. It's hard to imagine why Adam Sandler was one of the highest paid comedy actors at this time. I don't think he's been in a good movie yet, and since watching this utter sh*t, I refuse to watch anything with him in it.",The Waterboy

246,sarahclarno,"Review of ""The Waterboy""",8,16 May 2017,"""The Waterboy"" is a film starring Adam Sandler. It's part of the string of comedies that Adam Sandler put out in the late 90's, and I enjoyed it a lot. It wasn't very unique from his other films around that time, but it was still worth watching, and I'd recommend it if you're looking for laughs. As far as artistic value goes this movie wasn't anything special. If you've seen ""Billy Madison,"" ""Happy Gilmore,"" or any of his other movies that were released around this time then you should have a pretty good idea of what to expect. The kind of plain filming does give a very distinct feeling of the 90's though, so maybe that was the whole feeling they were shooting for at the time. The popularity of this movie wasn't overwhelming by any means, but it was an improvement from the film ""Billy Madison"" that Adam Sandler had released only three years earlier. While ""Billy Madison"" didn't even make $30 Million in box office sales, ""The Waterboy"" made around $186 Million box office. I think this movie is attractive to anyone who just wants a good laugh. The entertainment doesn't really come from the time, but rather the characters. So it's never really outdated or boring, and it's always a good watch. The moral of this story to me is that you can do anything you set your mind to. Rather than letting people pick on you, and tell you what you can or can't do, if you try hard and commit then you can get it done. This movie approaches that idea a little differently from other films in that it plays Bobby up to be kind of dopey. And he finds what he wants to do by accident just from getting angry and not putting up with the bullying anymore. The conflicts in this movie are kind of just pushed through as the story goes on. He sticks with how he wants things, has a moment of doubt, then comes back around at the end and the resolution is found. The climax and resolution give the big win that you're always hoping Bobby will get, and that's pretty much the end of the film after that. All-in-all it was a good film with not too deep of a plot, but still enjoyable to watch. I'd recommend giving this movie a watch if you're bored one weekend and need a laugh.",The Waterboy
247,seankelly-56462,Stands the test of time,10,30 June 2017,"Comedy is harder than drama. A comedy where the jokes get funnier with each watch, that is rare. Haters gonna hate but Sandler's comedic timing and goofy expressions are unparalleled in this day and age. FYI: the origin of Bobby Boucher: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iEEH_i-7cA",The Waterboy
248,Plsdontroastmeimjustachild,Really Funny Movie,10,9 March 2018,"The Waterboy is about an awkward, stuttering guy in his mid-thirties named Bobby Boucher who lives with his mom (Kathy Bates) in rural Louisiana. He works as a waterboy (hence the name) for a very successful college football team, and has since he was a young boy. Unfortunately, he's fired, so he takes his services to a much smaller team called the South Central Louisiana State Mud Dogs. On his first day, he is made fun of by a player, and the coach tells him to do something about it. Bobby tackles the guy, completely destroying him. The coach asks him to join the team, and Bobby accepts, but keeps it secret from his over-protective mom. Bobby leads the pathetic Mud Dogs to a great season, culminating in a berth to a bowl game against his former employer. A lot of stuff goes down, and long story short, Bobby shows up to the game at halftime and leads the Mud Dogs to a comeback victory. The entire movie is hilarious, and unless you've seen the movie before, the plot is actually a little unexpected. Boucher is played by Adam Sandler. I know, his movies lately have been pretty bad, but his old ones are good, especially this one. The humor in the movie is outrageous, including subtle nods to people who actually follow football, such as hall of fame linebacker Lawrence Taylor saying, ""Don't smoke crack"" to kids (Taylor famously wrote a book in which he admitted to using cocaine often). Sandler over-acts in his role as a mentally challenged person, but it's the over-acting that makes his character so funny. The roles of scouts and reporters are filled by actual scouts and reporters, like former players Dan Fouts and Lynn Swann. I've never actually been to Louisiana, so I don't know how people are there, but I imagine most of the characters are over-acted as well, especially Bobby's mom and most of the fans. The over-acting helps set the mood of the movie, however, so I think it's a welcome addition. Unlike most stupid comedies, the plot is not too stupid. Yes, it's kind of stupid, but it at least shows motive for all the characters, as well as establishing what makes each character unique. That's more than can be said about some other stupid movies. You can clearly understand why Bobby wants to play football, why the coach of SCLSU is scared and crazy, and why Bobby's mom is scared of him playing football.
 When watching The Waterboy, you really shouldn't approach it looking for a sophisticated movie with high-class humor. If you watch it knowing that it's going to be stupid, which you should since it's an Adam Sandler movie, then you are always going to have a fun time watching it. However, if you approach it like a movie critic, thinking you can tell other people what makes a movie good, then you are going to leave disappointed. Some people need to open their minds and stop being so butthurt about movies like The Waterboy. Just enjoy the damn movie instead of trying to critique every part of it.
 The Waterboy is a great movie that everybody should watch. His humor may not be enjoyable to everybody, but Sandler delivers a hilarious film with this one. It won 6 awards and was nominated for 6 more, and it never fails to make everybody laugh. Among the awards it was nominated for or won are MTV Best Comedic Performance for Sandler and Blockbuster Favorite Supporting Actress for Bates. Before watching The Waterboy, prepare for countless jokes and laughs, not amazing cinematography or great acting. The plot is surprisingly intriguing, and the viewer usually finds themselves rooting for Bobby to go out and win the Bourbon Bowl. The film does a great job of making an antagonist, Coach Red, that is extremely unlikable, so Bobby and his team becomes likable by contrast. The story of how the SCLSU Mud Dogs came together, bonded, and came back to win the Bourbon Bowl over the heavily favorited Louisiana Cougars is timeless. It has become a sports cult classic that is so popular that the social media accounts of sports media sites like ESPN and Bleacher Report acknowledge the anniversary of its release every year. Bobby Boucher will go down in history as one of the best fictional sports figures ever.",The Waterboy
249,masashijf,A Sandler Cult Classic,9,12 October 2018,"An unknown force lurked in my house for years. Forgot and shoved out of sight, the DVD was in my house for the longest time. I never knew of its existence. My dad must of bought the DVD when it originally came out in 1998. One fateful night would change that all. My friends wanted to come over and watch a late night movie. One of their eyes lasered a busted and dusty DVD cover on the bottom of a the stack of old movies. He held it to the light, and he immediately begged us all to play the movie. I inserted the disc into the disc reader and pressed the play button. My experience watching the movie The Waterboy by Frank Coraci was vivid and memorable. Many critics complain that the movie uses humor to the lowest level like fart jokes or slapstick comedy. However, the film is able to piece these jokes perfectly to create masterpiece of cinema. The golden acting, solid punchlines, and visual movements in the film brought down to my knees. The Waterboy is a great cinematic experience for all audiences because the film maximizes its character synergy and dialogue while maintaining a good standard of comedy. The film utilities character interaction in a professional manner. The star of the film is Bobby Boucher, who is played by world renowned comedian actor Adam Sandler. By himself, the main character Bobby is honestly pretty flat and weak (most haters use this as a point). Bobby's main contributions to the film are his stutters and retardation. However, each supporting character brings a new warmth in personality that complements Bobby and inadvertently the entire movie. An example of this is between Bobby and his southern mother Helen. Helen is flawed character, like her son, as she is overprotective of her only son. When they are on screen together, the true genuine moments of the film shine. There is a scene where Bobby consults with his mother while she is sick-stricken in bed. This is a climax in the film, and Bobby decides to play in the Bowl game against his mother's wishes. The entire town rushes to support Bobby's side, and overwhelmed by the love her son is receiving, Helen confesses her fake sickness. This is a really heartwarming scene that teaches the moral lesson of honesty and trust. These scenes are spread throughout to teach valuable lessons to the viewers.  The jokes are crud in nature but reflect well while watching. Most films deliver jokes in an unconventional portion of the film to surprise the audience. However, The Waterboy literally makes the entire film a well executable joke. There is no beating around the bush; these jokes are raw in form. The most infamous joke in the film occurred while Bobby was attending a Biology class. The professor criticizes Bobby's informal education from his mother as being baseless. Bobby, a non-academic type, refutes the professor's claim by addressing him as colonel Sanders, the famous face of Kentucky Fried Chicken. The professor has a round figure and a curly, white mustache that matches the colonel. There are plenty of hidden gems spread throughout the film that include cultural references and good honest slapstick humor. This uniqueness places the movie above other comedic films. The acting in the film creates characters that are real and emotional. Adam Sandler plays a genuine role. His ineptitude and struggles are believable through Sandler's presteen acting skills. He was presented the Blockbuster favorite actor award for comedy due in part to this movie. Even the supporting cast had illustrious acting careers and achievement. For example, the sad and incompetent coach Klein who has a character arc of his own. He was played by two time Golden Globe winner Henry Winkler. The execution for each line is so well done that the movie was able to absorb all of my attention. The director, Frank Coraci, is credited for films like The Wedding Singer or The Ridiculous 6. These group of stars places The Waterboy among the greats. One can find amazing acting, storytelling, and comedy in The Waterboy. This movie is underrated, and is sadly considered a mediocre appearance by Sandler. I believe this movie has become a cult classic in recent years. I encourage a re-watch of this forgotten film, to embrace the nostalgia or experience a life-altering film for the first time. No other comedy movie can compete with the package that this film punches.",The Waterboy
