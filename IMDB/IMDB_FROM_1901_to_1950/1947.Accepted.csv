0,SnoopyStyle,Stupid but a few good laughs not enough,5,12 April 2014,"Bartleby Gaines (Justin Long) is a high school slacker schemer. He is rejected by every college. And his parents won't give him the college money so he comes up with a plan. He and various college reject friends start up their own fake college. Only the website is so real that all kind of people show up after being accepted. Now they have to fake a college for real.Justin Long is his jittery self. Jonah Hill is still fat at the time. Blake Lively is the hot dream girl. The premise is stupid stretched thin to insulting. There are a few good laughs, but it's not enough. The movie just runs out of gas.",Accepted
1,Prismark10,College Kids,5,5 October 2013,"I actually watched an advance preview of this film in Hollywood. I had to lie about my age to get in and pretend to be a few years younger than I actually was.So the film was aimed at the more younger market, the kids that liked the American Pie films although Accepted tries to be less raunchy and more cerebral. The main plot revolves around a group of wannabe college students who create their own fake college called the South Harmon Institute of Technology (SHIT) after being rejected from all the universities for which they applied to. Lewis Black, an unconventional teacher is roped in to act as the Dean whilst the Dean of a real college, played by Anthony Heald is their nemesis.The plot might be far-fetched but Justin Long and the leads have charm and likability. They are giving rejected students a chance to get further education and soon realise that they have a real college with real education to give. Lewis Black gives life lessons and although it lacks the bawdiness of the American Pie films, it is sporadically amusing and is amiable enough but not rip roaring funny.",Accepted
2,jboothmillard,Accepted,5,10 April 2010,"I instantly recognised the title, but I was a little mistaken about the cast, I thought Anna Faris was in it, but it doesn't matter, I was up for seeing it anyway. Basically Bartleby 'B' Gaines (Justin Long) is the young slacker who has applied for many colleges, and every single one have turned him down, to the irritation of his parents Jack (Mark Derwin) and Diane (Ann Cusack). So in a desperate attempt to get somewhere, he and his friends turn an abandoned mental institute building into a realistic looking college, to be called South Harmon Institute of Technology (notice the letters spell a rude word). Along with the letter of acception, a website and fake (and former) Dean Richard Van Horne (Anthony Heald), the parents are fooled into believing this fully functioning building is a real college. The only problem though is that the website they created was too good, and unfortunately hundreds of other rejected students have come knocking at the door expecting education. B and the guys do as best they can to get students to suggest lessons they want taught, while the mean dean of North Harmon is planning to extend their grounds. Eventually the wrong people find out the truth about South Harmon, and it turns into a court case to prove that it can survive and become a real college, I think it ended well. Also starring Superbad's Jonah Hill as Sherman Schrader, Blake Lively as Monica Moreland, Maria Thayer as Rory Thayer, Adam Herschman as Glen, Columbus Short as Daryl 'Hands' Holloway, Lewis Black as Ben Lewis and Hannah Marks as Lizzie Gaines. I can see what the critics where it goes into American Pie and Road Trip territory, but just misses Ferris Bueller kind of thing, but it is sustainable enough to be enjoyed. Worth watching!",Accepted
3,ComedyFan2010,I accept it!,8,13 November 2013,"A very good, refreshing and lighthearted comedy that has a good point.The movie is not realistic at all. There is no way in this world that somebody who didn't get accept anywhere would bother with creating a new school, there are other options after all such as community colleges and trade school, plus it would never work. But the thing is that movies don't have to be realistic. As long as they are fun and bring a message and this movie does it.It is not the usual college comedy. It isn't all about sex and profanity (not that I am against such kind of a comedy but it is always fun to see something different). It has a very positive and clever humor.The cast is great as well. I liked Justin Long, Jonah Hill and it was great to see Leis Black. Although since this movie is not R rated he couldn't be at his best. Actors who are not as well known as these three were also a good collection. Jeremy Howard especially stood out.And I liked the message of the movie. It criticizes the obsession with traditional education. Which is not the best for everybody and often takes away from people the ability of self discovery. It is also very bureaucratic and doesn't always make sense. Like when Monica (Black Liveley) who majors in photography says that she can't take classes that are not part of her major (even though they are about photography as well). This fake college offers that self discovery to students ho are very much outcasts of the society (there is a guy with ADD, a stripper a creepy guy etc). I think the only problem with the movie was that they really dumbed down the college program. Instead having classes like ""daydreaming"" which is a total nonsense they could have been more creative. They still could have things like skating or rock'n roll and no traditional math/chemistry etc classes, but they could have more useful creative ideas. Something like ""exploring the nature around you"", ""inventing of new recipes"" etc. etc.",Accepted
4,edwagreen,Accepted Should Be Rejected *,2,22 May 2008,"Inane, awful farce basically about a young man who refuses to conform or better uses non-conformity to attain his objectives-fool his parents into thinking that he is attending a college. Truth is that this jerk has been rejected by every school he has applied to. After viewing this junk, you will see why.What a ridiculous name- South Hampton Institute of Technology. You don't have to be a rocket scientist to figure out the initials of this school of nonsense. Problem with these type of films is that in the end, the non-conformist becomes the accepted mode.Let's step back to the world of reality and call this film what it really is- excessive manipulative junk!",Accepted
5,wes-connors,Premature Accreditation,5,2 May 2010,"After too many years in high school, likable Justin Long (as Bartleby ""B"" Gaines) still can't get accepted at college. So, he makes one up. Mr. Long calls it the ""South Harmon Institute of Technology"" - the acronym of which spells out every juvenile's second favorite four-letter word. This is the filmmakers' big fat joke, and they make absolutely sure it doesn't go over your head. The premise is clever enough - things get going when people are ""Accepted"" at the school due to the handy website created by Long's hefty pal Jonah Hill (as Sherman Schrader III). This inspires the friends to create their own college.Steve Pink's directorial debut isn't as good as watching Mickey Rooney and Judy Garland turn an ordinary barn into a Busby Berkeley showplace, but more fun than watching Jonathan Harris (as Dr. Smith) turn the ""Jupiter 2"" into a resort hotel while the Robinsons are off looking for rocket fuel. A few philosophizing professors like Lewis Black (as ""Uncle"" Ben Lewis) really exist. But, while likable in individual scenes, the characters have little collective camaraderie. And, the ""A.D.D."" student - Robin Lord Taylor amusing as ""Abernathy Darwin Dunlap"" - is handled better than the running ""S.H.I.T."" joke.***** Accepted (8/18/06) Steve Pink ~ Justin Long, Jonah Hill, Lewis Black, Blake Lively",Accepted
6,Scarecrow-88,Accepted,9,4 November 2016,"Look, the plot is preposterous and unrealistic but the film is so much fun it's charms won me over. Long is a likable lead, but honestly he's too cool to be portrayed as such a disregarded kid. I would watch him and how the film wants to create this downgraded high school kid who couldn't get into a decent college and is portrayed as such a loser...but he's got all these charismatic qualities that sort of challenge that perception of school invisibility where his character appears uncool and abandoned by the cliques that determine worth as a recognized figure amongst his peers. When Blake Lively takes to Long, it isn't the same as Montgomery going gaga for Carradine in Revenge of the Nerds. He seems like just the kind of guy who could appeal to her. Jonah Hill, still pre-stardom and on the heavier side at this point in his career, is the buddy of Long who is attending an ivy league school treating him like a fool. Lively is dating frat prick Travis Van Winkle who mistreats Hill, while Long, Columbus Short, Maria Thayer, and Adam Herschman join forces to start a fake college accepting all the kids not good enough for all the other schools. S.H.I.T (South Harmon School of Technology) becomes party central and all the college undesirables are happy go lucky, free to be themselves and get involved in building this college into something more than a place to crash on the parents' dime. Culinary, art, meditation, and this wall chalkboard that allows the students to comment on what they want from the collegiate experience become a starting place for the school to thrive. Stripper hotties wanting more, with one of them put in charge of school outfits, a vert ramp in the yard for skateboarding, a pool for the kids to swim, rock music, and this active and wild contingency of youth coming together as Long determines to corral them into achieving their own dreams outside of the traditional college curriculum. PG-13 rating pushed to the brink just by a game Lewis Black as this anti-establishment former teacher who speaks his mind, bluntly and profanely, lending a hand to Long and his crack team of friends out of their depth at the beginning. Van Winkle's pop (Anthony Heald) wants the land Long's school occupies (a leased dump: former mental hospital!) so he starts trouble. Eventually Long will have to deal with a board of accreditation in the hopes of legitimizing the school. Clearly this cast of talented performers shot from the hip a great deal and while the film is mostly commenting somewhat on academic inequality and voicing for a different kind of collegiate attitude for those students not recognized as worthy of schools limiting who deserves to be accepted, more often than not, there's some laughs to be had here. Could wind up being a college comedy cult classic. Mark Derwin, as the uptight and disappointed dad, and Ann Cusack, as the sorrowed mother, rebounding from their pain of their son's lack of success in getting in a college when the fake school tricks them into believing he was on his way becomes quite amusing as the ruse is more and more difficult to maintain. The students becoming enthralled with Black's ramblings, even giving him a standing ovation, tells what kind of comedy this is. This was a nice surprise.",Accepted
7,lastliberal,We'll be S.H.I.T. heads forever,6,6 January 2008,"Steve Pink had a small role in one of my favorite films, Grosse Pointe Blank, and that is enough to get me to check out his directorial debut. It was original and funny and the laughs just kept coming at you - and they didn't have to resort to scatological humor to keep it funny.Justin Long may have played in movies that I have ignored (Dodgeball and Anchorman), but he showed some real talent here as he tried to figure life out and stand up on his own two feet. Bravo.Jonah Hill was really funny as his BFF who wanted to be accepted, but just didn't fit until he realized that friendship is more important that prestige.Hannah Marks was funny in her small role, and Blake Lively was just plain hot.Where do I sign up?",Accepted
8,zardoz-13,Entertaining But Lightweight Fun,8,28 March 2010,"Before he helmed ""Hot Tub Time Machine,"" director Steve Pink called the shots on the funny but featherweight, $23-million dollar, PG-13-rated, collegiate comedy ""Accepted,"" with Justin Long, Jonah Hill and Adam Herschman. This is one of those 'beat the system' movies. Essentially, this movie ridicules higher education in America and the college ranking system. Mind you, as entertaining as ""Accepted"" is, this film ranks well below other collegiate comedies such as ""Animal House,"" ""PCU"", ""Old School,"" ""Revenge of the Nerds,"" ""Back to School,"" and ""National Lampoon's Van Wilder.""Bartleby Gaines (Justin Long of ""The Break Up"") knows how to navigate the system. The first time we encounter our wily protagonist, Bartleby is forging fake IDs for his high school friends. Ironically, one of Bartleby's classmates, Glen (Adam Herschman of ""Consumed""), is posing for his mug shot in a high school T-shirt. Naturally, Glen has no clue how contradictory the T-shirt makes him look in the context of the photo. Bartleby explains that such a shirt invalidates the ID, but Glen remains oblivious to this logic. Dismissing Glen's ignorance, Bartleby says that he fix photo in post-production. One of his closest friends, Sherman Schrader (Jonah Hill of ""Superbad""), slips into the room and warns Bartleby that Vice Principal Mathews (Tim Bagley of ""Happy, Texas"") is heading to the room. According to Sherman, Mathews sneaks into the room regularly to masturbate to pictures of women in a gym magazine. Hastily, Bartleby improvises so when Mathews enters the room, everybody there for a counterfeit ID made is rehearsing as a part of a glee club. When Mathews points out that the high school has not glee club, Bartleby makes veiled references to what the principal intends to do with the magazine and scares him off. Bartleby proves throughout the ""Accepted"" that he has the ability to rebound on short notice. Later, in similar predicaments, not only does this knack save Bartleby's bacon, but it also foreshadows his dealings with another academic prick. Sadly, Bartleby's gift for getting his butt out of a crack doesn't extend to making high grades.Unfortunately, Bartleby has no luck finding a college that will accept him. In fact, every college that he applies for turns him down. Unhappily, our hero resigns himself to a life without higher education. Bartleby's father, Jack Gaines (Mark Derwin of ""Dirty Deeds""), however, insists that his son attend a college because it is a part of life. Since he cannot matriculate, Bartleby creates his own college with his friends. They name it South Harmony Institute of Technology. This name makes for an amusing but scatological acronym and his best friend for life, Sherman designs a website to fool Bartleby's father. The guys take out a lease on an abandoned insane asylum, renovate it, slap a sign on it, and proceed to party like there is no tomorrow. Daryl 'Hands' Holloway (Columbus Short of ""Quarantine"") pulls the most outlandish stunt here when he carves a fertility statue that has a lengthy penis jutting out of it, while Glen takes charge of the culinary arts program. Basically, the students run the school. Later, during an accreditation hearing, this concept of students teaching the courses comes back to skewer them.Clearly, the metaphor about the inmates running the asylum is apt. Suddenly, teens flock to the college and Bartleby discovers that Sherman put a click button on the site that admits them automatically so our hero finds himself surrounded by every reject imaginable. Eventually, the dean of a nearby university, Dean Richard Van Horne (Anthony Heald of ""Silence of the Lambs""), who wants the property that the school is situated on, tries to sabotage the school. Clearly, this opus pits narrow-minded, buttoned-down, suit and tie traditionalists against the open-minded iconoclasts with predictable but entertaining consequences. Naturally, our free-wheeling college kids forget to obtain accreditation, and Van Horne has the authorities close the school down and charge Bartleby with fraud. Things, however, are far from over.Indeed, the Adam Cooper, Bill Collage, and Mark Perez screenplay follows the ""Animal House"" formula, but shuns nudity. If you're keeping count, they use the four-letter word for fecal matter over 50 times. The writers do create several interesting characters, especially one fellow who can wield his mind to explode things. Altogther, ""Accepted"" qualifies as a fast-moving farce that entertains. ""Accepted"" coined $10-million during its opening weekend.",Accepted

10,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,Smarter than you may think,7,25 July 2009,"Bartleby Gains is finishing high school. Next, he's going to attend college. The problem? None of them accepted him. The solution? To make his own. As the case is with any other sitcom-type plot, the deception snowballs, and there are a lot of laughs along the way on account of the expansion of the lie, and the truth almost being revealed. One could even accuse the presentation of the themes and the message of being naive and not as mature as it may think it is... but the moral itself, and the case made for it here, are excellent, and food for thought on one of the most important aspects of civilization, the education system, here with the higher levels being the main focus. It's also surprisingly funny, and actually not as full of gross-out comedy and humiliation jokes as teen romps(and sadly, humorous productions in general) have been for a while, and arguably is at the worst heights(or depths) currently. There are many kinds of jokes and gags in this, and the majority work. The acting is good, and Long handles the lead role quite well. There are genuinely likable, credible and memorable characters in this. The story is interesting and develops nicely throughout, and the pacing is spot-on. Editing and cinematography are effective, and this has definite serious moments, without becoming a lecture. There is sensuality and sexual references, a moderate amount of strong language, all within the limits of a PG-13 rating of recent years. I recommend this to anyone who enjoys these. 7/10",Accepted
11,george.schmidt,"Frequently funny amalgam of ""Old School"" meets ""Animal House"" by way of ""Revenge of the Nerds"" comedy",7,28 August 2006,"ACCEPTED (2006) **1/2 Justin Long, Jonah Hill, Adam Herschman, Columbus Short, Maria Thayer, Lewis Black, Blake Lively, Mark Derwin, Ann Cusack, Hannah Marks, Anthony Heald, Travis Van Winkle.

Long does a fine job as the ring-leader getting in touch with his inner Vince Vaughn/Bill Murray as the smart-aleck nerdling and his gang of misfits would've been funnier if they actually gave props to the miscreant enrollees instead of reducing them to just cartoons.

12,view_and_review,Revenge of the Nerds Redressed,6,13 September 2015,"""Accepted"" is about a small band of high school graduates, led by Bartleby Gaines (Justin Long), that began a college. They say that necessity is the mother of invention. Well, these kids were all rejected from known universities and had to concoct a plan to stave off parental accosting (I guess junior colleges didn't exist in this town). Coincidentally (or not coincidentally) this very thing occurred in Germany in 1948.This movie was mildly funny and really if it weren't for Jonah Hill it would not have been that. Justin Long's style and the played out clichés just didn't do it for me. What clichés? Well, he was rejected by Harmon College which, of course, is full of wealthy xenophobic WASPs who wouldn't even urinate on you if you were on fire if you don't fit their mold. Harmon College and its attendees were the typical over-the-top bourgeois, nose-in-the-air, stuck up group which give the undying impression that all rich people are a-holes. And Bartleby, or B, was the quirky, witty, cliché individualist that flies in the face of the establishment. In other words, a Hollywood plot we've all seen a thousand times.That's not to say that the movie was a total bust and not worth watching. Like I stated, Johan Hill as Sherman Schrader was great. It was interesting enough to see how big he used to be. Lewis Black, for those who like him, was in classic form. The movie had good moments and provided a solid story of a school started by students. It's just Justin Long and the redressed ""Revenge of the Nerds"" that I didn't like.",Accepted
13,anaconda-40658,Not Accepted.,2,9 September 2015,"Accepted (2006): Dir: Steve Pink / Cast: Justin Long, Blake Lively, Anthony Heald, Jonah Hill, Lewis Black: Stupid absurd comedy about those unable to find their place within society. Justin Long is rejected by eight colleges so within the heat of parental pressure he and his friends create their own college. Unfortunately their Internet web page gains more notice than intended as others begin to show up. Rushed premise with predictable structure as Long struggles to sideline his parents and other authority regarding the school, which leads to a ridiculous and forgettable climax. It has none of the humour or spirit that made National Lampoon's Animal House successful. Director Steve Pink tries for innovation but he is basically shooting a script totally devoid of humour. Long is hardly sympathetic and his big moral speech in the conclusion isn't needed. Blake Lively plays the typical hot chick whom Long will eventually impress. Anthony Heald plays the dean of an opposing college but the role is lifeless and standard. Jonah Hill plays Long's best friend who steals moments but not enough. Lewis Black is the one funny performance as the fake dean but unfortunately there is not enough of him, and there is way too much of everybody else. Its education theme is bogus and completely dries up any potential for humour that it might have had. Instead it is a film that should be accepted by no one. Score: 2 / 10",Accepted
14,FlashCallahan,Have fun being hot....,7,22 November 2012,"Bartleby is a fun loving slacker who gets turned down for every college he applies for, much to the annoyance of his expectant parents.So, he creates the South Harmon Institute of Technology, and lo and behold, he is accepted.However, his parents want to see the website, the campus, and the dean. So now he has his friend Sherman build a web page, they lease out an abandoned psychiatric hospital, and they hire Sherman's uncle Ben to be the dean.The web page was done so well, that hundreds of students show up at the front door, all of which were turned down by other colleges.Faced with no choice, Bartleby decides to proceed with turning South Harmon into a real college......Never really had any intention of seeing this movie, but it was a real treat and harks back to the high school movies of the eighties.Long is great as always and reminds one of Cusack in movies like better off dead and the sure thing. The rest of the cast are okay, but really have nothing on Long.It loses its pace toward the end, what with all the speeches about equality, and the posh school grates after a while, but with films like this, we always need a bad guy, and we always need a heart warming speech.well worth seeing though",Accepted
15,DICK STEEL,A Nutshell Review: (DVD) Accepted,7,15 September 2008,"The premise of this film is as ludicrous as it sounds, but I guess it takes a lot to try and mold a character into the next Ferris Bueller or Van Wilder. Justin Long stars as Bartleby Gaines, and the name will already tell you that it's not catchy enough with certain vibes as to the quality of this teenage comedy dwelling on the fantasies of students who well, don't meet the grade to further their studies.Justin Long seemed to languish in the doldrums and perhaps one of the few actors these days to seem satisfied with taking on rather mediocre roles, considering that he did headline flicks such as Jeepers Creepers, partnered Bruce Willis in Die Hard 4, and had a whole hosts of supporting roles in movies, but still is unable to truly make everyone sit up, still waiting for that breakthrough role that other guys (such as one called Shia) have all the luck for. Some guys get all the luck as the song goes, while others just have to make do and wait for their time.And of course, the role of Bartleby Gaines is perfect for Long, given the character waits and gets rejected by just about every school out there, only for him to hatch a hare brain idea to start his own university, so that he can shake his parents off his back. With the help of good friend Sherman Schrader (Jonah Hill, being incredibly fat here), they start a university aptly abbreviated as - South Harmon Institute of Technology, only that there's no proper support structure and administrative function, and what they think was just an empty shell in order to pull off their bluff. But of course, for a comedy to function, they soon realize that their website attracted like-minded and students facing similar rejections with no school to belong to, and with hundreds of students paying 10 grand each for an education, why not make the best of it?It's a comparison on what real life is, and what the fantasized version has the potential to become, in being able to learn what you want to learn, and given plenty of room to experiment. It goes a long way in showcasing how everyone in charge of their own destiny, can actually benefit from taking a keen interest to further their respective expertise and skills in areas not taught solely in books, and frankly speaking, are able to excel by working on their strengths.Don't expect the usual slapstick or outright comedy here, as it does provide some food for thought, but only quite. It's really a juvenile story suitable for a lazy evening, as you partake in the dreams of a slacker who makes good his unintended promise to educate himself and his peers. Generally acceptable, but not great.The bare bones Code 3 DVD by Universal Home Video comes presented in anamorphic widescreen and audio is available in either English, Spanish or Portuguese Dolby Digital 5.1.

16,StevePulaski,Doesn't dumb down to the mediocre standards of current teen comedies,8,1 July 2011,"Accepted is an original and highly energized comedy with lots of characters and all of them equally as funny. It serves as the 2000's version of the classic 1978 Animal House, and doesn't get all hung up on clichés. The ending especially is a fantastic way to wrap up this movie.It's hard enough to build a movie like this from the ground up when you really haven't seen a movie like this before. Movies about kids going to College, or trying to have sex before College is common, but seeing a group of kids construct their own College is new. It's not like when there is a nerd, who falls in love with popular blonde, gets into some antics, confesses his love to her at the end, movie's over. There hasn't been a movie like this done before. The director and screenwriter couldn't look at another movie for hints. They were their own rubric. Not other successful movies.The plot: Bartleby Gaines (Long) is a high school Senior who is rejected from several colleges much to the dismay of his strict parents. In an act of desperation, Bartleby fakes an acceptance letter from the fictional College called South Harmon Institute of Technology (an acronym for a beautiful word). He forces his buddy Sherman ""Schrader"" (Hill) to construct a fake, but seemingly official website for the school to prove to show his dad an overview of the institution.Bartleby and his friends Hands (Short), who lost a scholarship in Football, Rory (Thayer), who was denied acceptance into Yale, and Glen (Herschman) who got a zero on the SAT go to a rundown mental hospital, repair it, and pass it off to their parents as a College. But due to a flaw on the website that allows anyone acceptance to the College by clicking on an area, hundreds of kids show up at South Harmon awaiting to have a great College experience.It turns out at this College, the students party and screw around the whole day. Bartleby uses the tuition money to buy things like a half-pipe, an in-ground swimming pool, and material to fix up other parts of the ""College."" I like Justin Long in pretty much everything he's done. From his ""let's do it"" attitude in Jeepers Creepers, to his hunger for winning in Dodgeball: A True Underdog Story he's been a joy to see on screen. The supporting cast of Blake Lively, Jonah Hill, and Columbus Short also work in the movie's favor providing just enough laughs to recommend the film to someone looking for a good comedy.Lewis Black plays the ""Dean"" of the South Harmon, the alcoholic and foul-mouthed uncle of Schrader who spends his days teaching the kids the lies of the government and how to live an independent life. Never seeing Black in a movie before, I was pleasantly surprised about his role in the film.Accepted's end scene, like I said, is not only a great wrap up, but it's true to human nature. Some kids should not be looked down upon because of their desire to stand out. Everyone is supposed to be who they are, and not someone they are not. The whole moral of the College is changed in the final scenes of the film. It started out as a lie to the folks, it ends as a message to all students who want to become something.Starring: Justin Long, Columbus Short, Blake Lively, Jonah Hill, Maria Thayer, Mark Derwin, Anthony Heald, Lewis Black, and Diora Baird. Directed by: Steve Pink.",Accepted
17,Smells_Like_Cheese,"Not really funny, but it actually wasn't a bad film",6,28 November 2006,"I wasn't too interested in seeing Accepted, from the trailer, it looked like your typical college frat boy film that would either have annoying or gross humor. But most of my friends were giving this film some pretty decent compliments and saying that it was a fun film to watch. So I figured to stop judging and give this movie a shot. I always say ""What do I have to loose?"" when I pick up a movie at a rental video store.Bartleby Gaines is a high school failure who has been rejected by almost every college in his state, his father is sure that he will be disappointed again with his son. So Bartleby decides to get his parents to be quiet and stop picking on him, he forges a letter from South Harmon Institute of Technology, his own made up college. His close friends help him create an abandoned building into a college, but other rejects from other schools hear about South Harmon Institute of Technology and decide that they want to go their too. But there is a group of frat boys at the snobby college who want to tear down South Harmon Institute of Technology since that's where all the fun is.Over all, I'd recommend Accepted, it was a fun movie to watch, although I still think that it had junior high comedy that is really old, it still worked for the movie. It was nice to get away from the rude humor that is typical with a college movie. So, just sit back and have fun with Accepted, you might be just as pleasantly surprised as I was.6/10",Accepted
18,KineticSeoul,"Not funny, but not a terrible comedy",4,16 October 2010,"This is one of those comedies where the trailer is better than the actual movie itself. Just about every aspect of this movie is just plain silly and ridiculous and not in a good way either. The end tries to show a message but it's just not believable on some layers to the point I just ended up rolling my eyes. And the final scene with it's message is basically the only decent part of the whole movie, plus most of it just isn't funny. In another words it was less than what I expected, almost everyone in this movie is either retarded or extremely stupid. It's a movie even if you just go with it, you don't really get anything out of it. Plus almost nothing about this movie is remotely memorable and overall mundane. It's okay when a comedy is ridiculous even super ridiculous, but this movie is just plain stupid and not in a good way either, it's basically outlandish. I don't get how some people claim this is the best comedy ever, either they haven't seen enough good comedies or they are freaking out of their minds.

20,Robert_duder,Kind of a nice little comedy with a hint of Animal House without being over the top,8,17 December 2006,"Accepted, for the most part, is probably exactly the way it presents itself. Amusing, a teen comedy, a decent feel good message, funny friends, sarcastic charming lead and romance with the hot girl. So despite an air of predictability Accepted turns in a pretty good show and at the very least is enjoyable, watchable and all around a decent fun flick. First time director Steve Pink probably played it pretty safe and it works for him because the story is good and the characters are strong and it's just something light and fluffy that teenagers will like and adults will chuckle at if they remember their college days but what separates Accepted is that there is actually a bit of a Disney type message there about failure and acceptance and that sort of thing. It's funny and cute.Young, talented actor Justin Long is quickly gaining a recognizable face in young Hollywood. I first pegged him to be a great actor in the terrifically done Jeepers Creepers and in Accepted he definitely shows a different side of himself as the sarcastic, likable, Bartleby Jones ""B"". This is the first time I've really seen him heading up the cast and he does it perfectly and is definitely watchable and funny. He has a definite screen presence which sometimes seems a little amateur but he'll work up to it. It's not exactly a touch, gritty film. Jonah Hill plays B's best friend since Grade School but determined and smart Sherman Schrader who does get accepted to a prestigious school but still works to help his friend pull off his ""fake"" school that turns out to be helping a lot of unaccepted students of all kinds. Hill has some really great comedic talent and is the perfect sidekick to Long's character. I would have liked to have seen some more buddy type comedy situations between them as they played off each other very well and came across as great friends. I think ""Let me tell you about my Weeeeiner"" will become a familiar line in film history in my books. The rest of the cast is made up of a mish-mash of unique characters all funny and slapstick in their own way. You have Adam Herschman who is hilarious as experimental chef Glen ""I'm working some very unstable Herrrrbs,"" Mark Derwin as the over protective and suspicious father (Derwin is always a great character actor,) Hannah Marks as the too smart little sister, Jeremy Howard as the rather freaky student to join the campus and so many more. Too many to list here. They all come together and basically just have one big great old time that is fun to watch and it all comes together nicely (if not completely unrealistically in the end.) The best thing I can say about Accepted is that it's definitely worth seeing and the worst I can is that it's a little light, pointless, kind of predictable but at least it has that element of watch-ability which means that it will stick around in our minds much like other teen comedies that became legendary classics like Porky's or Animal House. Now Accepted isn't raunchy which makes it a little more family friends and it has far more of a actually intelligent story line at least compared to those films I mentioned. Either way if you want something to enjoy but not something that will hurt your brain Accepted is absolutely the way to go!! 8/10",Accepted
21,MLDinTN,starting your own college is ...,3,6 June 2007,"a piece of cake according to this movie. The whole idea of a several kids starting their own college was just too over-the-top. It goes beyond unbelievability. A college reject chooses to lie to his parents and say he was accepted to a made up college. He gets his friend to make a website for the college. Well, hundreds of kids who were rejected from every college they applied to show up to attend this school since clinking an ""accept"" button on the website was all you had to do to enroll. So, they use an old mental hospital as the school. They set up beds, cafeteria, and basically an all out party mode. They got a pool, hot girls, an ADD nerd, etc... The school up the street wants to take over and the dean does what he can to find out about this ""new"" college. And all the good guys win in the end.It wasn't that funny.

22,Floated2,loved this movie!,8,26 August 2009,"Accepted is definitely worth a watch. I'm a big fan of the ""underdog beats out overachiever"" kinda movies and this fits that bill perfectly. Also, I love that Accepted is funny without being trashy. I don't care for gratuitous swearing and sex in movies and generally, there's just too much of both these days. The plot is very original. About a guy who doesn't get accepted to college then he decides to make up a college to impress his father. It was actually really funny and entertaining. There were many funny scenes and funny characters. The movie may be unrealistic but its not meant to be a serious movie. Look, if you're expecting something deep and meaningful, its probably not for you, if you want lots of gross humor and nudity, don't bother with this one, but you just want fun and frolics, with interesting, well acted characters and a solid plot, you'll want to watch Accepted. I recommend this movie is real great!",Accepted
23,Movie_Muse_Reviews,Too outlandish to succeed among comedies of its kind,5,19 December 2007,"When you see that ""Accepted"" stars Justin Long and Jonah Hill, there's a sense that it comes from the same vein of recent successful comedies (Long in ""Dodgeball"" or Hill in ""40-Year- Old Virgin), but the comedy is simply too ridiculous in concept and the characters too uninteresting to bring this movie to that level.In the film, Long plays an unsuccessful high school graduate who doesn't get accepted into any schools of his choice despite his friend (Hill) getting into a reputable Ohio school. Along with some other screw-up friends, Long decides to create his own university where he can fake his own acceptance to to please his disappointed parents. How they go about making this happen, you just have to push past a few large logical hurdles to understand.Long plays the part well as a smart-ass teenager whose best skill is deception. The humor comes from his supporting cast and some of the oddball characters are hit and miss. Ultimately there are too many weirdos and the movie goes back and forth between clever ridiculous and teen trash comedy. The fact that the movie then tries to take itself serious as a social commentary on education is an entire waste of time given how implausible the whole situation is in the first place.In other words, this comedy on premise alone applies it's going nowhere from the start, even if you desperately want it to, and some of the humor makes it a bit above trash level for the most part. This is nothing more than a one time rental flick.",Accepted

26,triple8,"not realistic in the slightest but a perfect ""guilty pleasure"" movie and actually quite funny in some areas.",6,21 July 2007,"SPOILERS:This is the sort of movie you couldn't call outstanding or a perfect comedy but it's fine to watch if your just going for something light with some laughs and a great message at it's center. It's about a kid who doesn't get into any of the colleges he applies to so he starts his own make believe college. Originally this idea is known only to him and a few friends. but with a fictitious website and an actually physical location for the college,things start to spin out of control and soon hundreds of kids who didn't get in anywhere else are showing up at this fictional college ready to start class.. and what interesting classes they are too! This premise is really REALLY good, very creative and the movie's message is absolutely great. And the movie itself actually isn't bad. In terms of humor, I thought the beginning and end were quite funny and fun. Unfortunately the middle has some problems as it drags quite a lot and isn't as funny as other areas of the movie. There's a lot of attention on the daily life at the college only some scenes go on a really long time which I think could have been shortened a bit and there is no realism to some aspects of the movie at all. Yet, in a way, it doesn't really matter. The movie has fun with itself and it's a nice hour and one half of laughs and fun. There are worse ways to spend some time.I liked the ending. Predictable as anything but it works so well. For me movies I think are good I rate a 7 and REALLY good or excellent an 8 or above. The rating of 6 is for guilty pleasure type movies-just like this one. I think this actually could have been a classic comedy because of the great premise and the message to it. Good teen comedies that do comedy well and have a message..and a good one at that..are not plentiful. But I just thought the movie as a whole could have been funnier and there could have been some attempt to explain some of the plot holes and develop some of the characters a bit more. Also I will say I don't think the title was a great choice..it isn't all that attention getting and I was having problems remembering it myself. But I liked the premise, enjoyed the movie and laughed many a time. Not perfect but pretty funny and it's strongest point is the great message that has plenty of basis in reality and I must say I would have appreciated a movie like this when I was in High School. And darn that school looked fun! I'd actually give this a 6.5 of 10. It's both funny and sweet and sure has a great premise. Better then what one might expect.",Accepted
27,Seraphion,S.H.I.T load of just enough,6,20 September 2014,"The story's basic premise is actually quite nice, although it turns out to be so very predictable. As another comedy about a lie going all too elaborate, it's on the viewers' head that B would make a fake college and continue on with it as soon as the scene shows him scanning the letter for the Harmon logo. The only things left to keep viewers curious and interested are how they will materialize. It's quite funny to see that the sort of 'crew' this kind of comedy usually has is comprised of quite a varied background but with one similarity, they all get rejected to college. The building arrives also quite predictably; I guessed it would either be a mental hospital or a prison. The rest unravels just as other comedies do, so this movie doesn't offer any new thing on that regard. The acting side is another standard overall. What's funny to notice is that Kellan Lutz acted out one of his first performances here.",Accepted

With the ridiculous premise that you have to go to college, what happens to the qualified people that don't get in: they make their own way, literally.Just the concept of doing something like this is fascinating, and with the cast, the delivery is amazing: Justin Long, Blake Lively, Maria Thayer, (fat) Jonah Hill, Lewis Black, and even a young Hannah Marx.The jokes are paced so well, and there is some noticeable punch up, but it's usually so good I don't mind. Part of the reason I like this writing is that a lot of it is character based: just making weird and fun characters and making them live in this fun world. So many of the scenes have background action happening, which is risky, but the pay off is magnificent.On top of that, there are sub-arcs, and a great grand arc all about inclusivity and innovation.Watch this, I seriously doubt you'll be disappointed.",Accepted
29,dunmore_ego,Entirely Unacceptable,2,3 July 2007,"Justin Long is Bartleby Gaines, rejected from a series of reputable colleges, who forges an acceptance letter to a fake college to appease his parents and finds he must create an actual college campus to follow through with his ruse - South Harmon Institute of Technology (the sophomoric acronym S.H.I.T. used with ubiquitous abandon and little effect). Slackers from around the state actually attend and the ""college courses"" (Math-turbation, Men Are Weak, Exploding Things with your Mind, Watching Bikini Girls, etc.) are actually accredited by movie's end through the methodology of Inspiring Movie Speeches Accompanied by Music Swells (can anyone say *Scent of a Woman*?). Yes, it is almost as funny as that day you stubbed your toe on your bed.Writers Adam Cooper, Bill Collage, and Mark Perez, and director Steve Pink ask us to accept TOO MUCH without any quality comedy in return. Photoshopping letters of acceptance is one thing; designing a website that would pass scrutiny for parents about to shell out $10,000 for semester fees is another thing altogether. Bartelby's parents are fanatic enough about his college acceptance to feel his multiple rejections constitute moral and social failings on their part; they are embarrassed for him and for their family  then the movie asks us to believe that parents with that level of inculcation/indoctrination would accept a college's veracity/suitability for their son on the strength of a website, from which one cannot make contact with any authorities (obviously, or the scam would fall apart immediately).That's just the first obstacle this film deals with  as callously as it deals with every other obstacle. The implausibilities mount quicker than we can breathe: four friends transform a derelict mental hospital into a passable college campus that  once again  fools the parents (by this point, we are considering seriously that Bartelby's parents are mildly autistic); they set up a wacko acquaintance as a dean (Lewis Black  one of the only funny elements); no local authorities seem to exist to poke their noses into the transformation of the hospital site; electricity, water, maintenance concerns don't seem to exist in this universe By the half-hour mark, there is such an Everest of implausibilities that we almost *can't* breathe and one either a) sits back, relaxes, watches the movie and finds it funny, or b) feels like tearing out the eyes and mashing the genitals of the imbeciles who greenlit the imbeciles who created this low form of colon cancer.That's a case of ""b)"" for me, thanks The movie poises itself to explore a number of directions  all of which could have been comedic, any of which would have been more interesting than the sophomoric semi-trailer it slides itself under; firstly, Education: it IS an outdated Agrarian Age system, more interested in leaching the inquisitive mind from pupils and pimping them unto society as peons for the workforce. (Listen to Lewis Black's rants - they are quite astute, but in the context of this movie, taken as lunatic ravings.) Secondly, populating this fake college with dropouts and washouts and losers and arguing that they will make something of themselves if left to their devices is demonstrably asinine  unmotivated people are in their burger-flipping positions precisely because they *were* left to their devices and FAILED. They cannot create long-term game plans for themselves, let alone administer a college bureaucracy.Justin Long has created a niche for himself (young-ish geek, beige, unthreatening guy whom mother can meet) and he carries the movie well as a leading man, but not through any overt talent or charisma; rather because his supporting cast are so creamy vanilla with nothing on top. In fact, there is such a LACK of charisma in Long's supporting troupe (Jonah, Hill, Adam Herchman, Columbus Short, Maria Thayer), it feels as if they're only appearing in *Accepted* because, like their characters, they were rejected from parts on other films.",Accepted
30,chrichtonsworld,Interesting premise ruined by poor execution and too far fetched ideas,4,11 March 2009,"On the hand I understand the problem that is being discussed on the other hand the solution that is given is far to ridiculous for words. This movie starts out great with a wonderful premise. Not being accepted by the college of your choice because you don't meet their requirements even if you have the grades and points to be enrolled is a legitimate issue. Luckily this seems to be a typical American problem since in The Netherlands you can go to the University of your choice if you have the diploma that is required of you and pay the tuition that every college student has to pay. That's it. No extra demands. It is truly a mystery to me why a system like that exists in The States.For that reason I expected this movie to tackle this topic in a fun way. Sadly after 30 minutes this movie is not going anywhere and falls back to typical story lines we have seen before in movies like ""Revenge of the Nerds"" or ""Van Wilder"". With the exception that it isn't funny at all. Justin Long was excellent in ""Zack and Miri make a porno"" and pretty decent in ""Live Free or Die Hard"". But as a lead in this movie he is just not convincing enough. At one point I felt insulted. At a certain time in the movie Justin Long's character is forced to think of a solution for the situation he has put himself in. His resolve however (which is pretty admirable in heart) is so far fetched and unrealistic that I had to skip that part. The idea behind the solution is of course very idealistic but never would have worked in real life. In the the movie they let you believe that certain skills are developed if you let the students choose their own courses in stead of the standard courses given at colleges. They skip the facts that some students can't choose simply because they don't know what to do or that some need discipline because they can't cope with the freedom that is given to them once arrived at college. Ultimately this movie fails to stand out which is big shame since it could have been a good satire.",Accepted

32,Angelus2,Accepted; True depiction,10,12 October 2007,"I thought this film was very thought provoking; if you're a student trying to get into a College or University.I first noticed this film as I browsed through the Justin Long site.

Trying not to crush his parents dreams he lies to them explaining he has been accepted in a prestigious new College.One lie leads to an even bigger lie and soon Bartlebe finds himself leasing a property to show that he is actually attending a college.But a computer error spoils Bartlebe's plans and soon Bartlebe must start a fake college and the consequences that come with it.The film was very funny with Justin Longs own sense of comedy, slapstick.

36,DonFishies,"Black and Hill are great, but the rest are hindered by a really badly written screenplay",5,6 July 2007,"High school comedies and college comedies have all basically blended together for me. There are few standouts (Animal House, American Pie 2, The Breakfast Club, and a few more), and far too many that try to pull off the majesty and effect of movies like this. Accepted is one of them, and sadly, despite knowing this in advance, I subjected myself through it anyway.Bartleby Gaines (Justin Long) has just graduated from high school, and has been rejected from every college he has applied for. Having disappointed himself and his parents, Bartleby comes up with the idea to create his own acceptance letter from a school he made up himself. After impressing his parents, he shows his friends, and ends up doing the same for a few of them. But when school time comes around, Bartleby has to come up with an actual school to show his parents, and after managing to create one, has to deal with everyone else in the area who found their way into getting accepted by his fake school.Knowing full well that the movie was not going to be all that great, I found it particularly distressing that many other things did not work all to well either.Bartleby, the slacker and central character, is not likable, and does next to nothing to even attempt to make himself even vaguely appear to be. Yes, I laughed at a few of his lines, but the very core of his slack ideology comes nulls and voids most of the events of the film. This is a clear-cut sidekick character, written to try and seem like a main character. It is clear from the beginning that he really should not be the central character of the film, but never does the script even attempt to make it seem like he should be.Who should have been that central character you may ask? Well, the script never really figures that one out either. It introduces a lot of characters, with a lot of silly or egotistical traits, and then lets these bit-part players attempt to come out and feel more like that. These characters were rejected from college, clearly these was a reason for that. Did the screenwriters really need to make all of them so unconventionally bizarre that they feel more like they belong in a sitcom with a few interesting main characters to interact with? Little Miss Sunshine did comedy well with six very unconventional and sitcom-esquire characters, and did it with seemingly relative ease. Could the Accepted creators not follow that pattern, or even make a shining attempt to do so? Would it have been so hard to give us some distinguishable characters we actually want to care about, instead of obvious bit-parters who we should be laughing at in small doses, instead of who we should be laughing at for the entirety of the film?But I digress, from the worst part of it all: the fake school and the problems it creates. We know this idea is implausible, but the filmmakers make zero attempt at even making it look like anyone is trying to make it even remotely seem justifiable. I realize they were making a clear-cut clichéd comedy, but they could have at least put in the effort to make it seem like they were trying to make some sense out of this silly idea. Instead, it just becomes sillier and what may have seemed like an amusing idea at first, quickly warps into an idea that defies implausibility and borders on stupidity and idiocy. How something as banal and ridiculous as this managed to be greenlit really boggles my mind. While I did appreciate a very small dose of the laughs, I really enjoyed the work here from Lewis Black and Jonah Hill. Black seems to be here just to give the film a little bit of comedic credibility, and for the most part, he does fairly well in his small role. He clearly has a handle on what is funny and what is not, and much like his character, seems like he was paid a large sum of money just to be there and make stuff up. Thankfully, his made up stuff pays off and works very well. Much the same goes for Hill, who seems to have the supporting character role down pat. He nails every line with finesse, and plays off everyone just brilliantly. If his work here, and his work in the likes of Knocked Up and August's Superbad is any indication, this kid has a lot of potential.As said previously, Long's Bartleby character is a supporting character written as the main character, and sadly, Long is playing him as such. Long really does not have the presence or the charisma required to pull off such a massive role just yet, and it shows in how weak his performance is here. He knows what he is doing, but he just does not have a total handle on it just yet. A little bit more work, and maybe a better written character negated down to supporting duties would have made his work here so much better (just look at the likes of Live Free or Die Hard, and you will see just how much better suited he is not playing the lead).Everyone else, even more sadly, is either underwritten or completely clichéd. No one really looks to be putting the extra effort into their roles, and there is not even a highlight that I can think of to note.While it works in tiny doses, Accepted stands as a movie that was hindered by the start by a really badly written script. Had more preparation been done during the screen writing process, the film could have actually worked as more than just a rotten rehash of so many better movies.5/10.",Accepted

I like it, the only problem for me was the character development wasn’t that good, and there are too many characters that haven’t been polish very well. Like Glen he was suppose to be like Booger (Revenge of the Nerd) stupid, yet intelligence in his own way and funny. But here he hardly does anything.I love the cast, I love Justin Long, which guy is funny, I always follow his work and he does a pretty good job as “B”. Everyone here seems to fit the jigsaw very well. And the acting is decent though from time to time it gets cheesy and the dialogue is also weird at time.The movie consists of very touching and inspiring moments and the bond about friendship, and the stupid and how the education system should be. Unfortunately, the movie more or less lack in humor, don’t get it wrong, it just not “laugh out loud” kind it is more of smile type. This movie is for someone older and pre-teen that does not look for toilet humor and more life good morale kind of movie.Recommendation: Yea Sure, It Worth A Rental.Reason To Watch: Justin Long, Fake College.Reason Not To: If you’re A Teenager Looking For Real Humor and Nudity.Rating: 6.5/10 (Grade: C+)",Accepted

His mom and dad are very disappointed that Bartleby hasn't been accepted into college. His parents think that if Bartleby doesn't go to college, he will have no future. Several of Bartleby's friends are in the same situation of being rejected by all the colleges they applied to. To satisfy their parents, Bartleby comes up with an idea to start his own college with an internet site. They convert an abandoned psychiatric facility into the South Harmon Institute of Technology. They will be the only students. However, the web site states that we accept anyone. On the first day of school, they unexpectedly have a large number of accepted students that were also rejected by all colleges. With a million dollars in tuition money, Bartleby must make his fake college into a functioning one. He hires Uncle Ben (Lewis Black) as the College Dean. The fun begins when they design their own curriculum, make their own rules, and party all night.(My Comment) The premise of starting a college without a teaching staff is a little off the wall.

The movie reminded me of the classic movie ""Animal House"", the college setting, the fraternity, lots of gags, and pretty young women. These new college freshmen had a different notion of what the college experience was all about. The movie not only has lots of humor, it also has a good message for life. People should reach for their dream and create a passion for what they want to do in life and not settle for what other people want them to do. The ending was a little unrealistic, but it is only a movie. The movie was made for the young crowd to have a little fun. (Universal Pictures, Run time 1:32, Rated PG-13) (7/10)",Accepted

Of course that makes it immensely fun and a real joy to watch. It's a great movie to just sit back and watch for an hour and a half and get a lot of great laughs out of it. Most of these laughs come from the very impressive Jonah Hill who is an absolute uproar to watch in every performance he delivers. This is no exception. The film has the basic structure of mainstream comedy 'Crappy laugh & big problem + Solution & really fun hour + End of solution + Big sappy monologue & happy ending'.

45,postmanwhoalwaysringstwice,exceeds expectations...,6,30 December 2006,"""Accepted"" is collegiate comedy without the college, per se. Following closely in the footsteps of ""Animal House"", and occasionally showing recognizable beats of ""Back to School"", ""Accepted"" tells the story of a savvy high school graduate whose complete rejection from every college he has applied for leads him to create his own. Soon the place is filled with disenchanted rejects, and the ensuing story is completely ridiculous, but nonetheless has some good points about the conformity and exclusivism of higher education. Comedian Lewis Black stands out in a small role as a tweaked version of himself, as does Hannah Marks as the protagonist's younger, smart sister. The genuine, radical ideas behind the film are good, but frequently the message supersedes the comedy.",Accepted
46,christian123,A likable film but nothing too memorable.,5,1 January 2007,"Bartleby Gaines (Justin Long) has not had any luck getting into a single college, so in order to get his parents off his back, he creates the South Harmon Institute of Technology but before he and his friends can enjoy slacking off there, hundreds of applicants show up to be admitted to the one college that won't turn them down.Accepted may not offer much originality but it does offer a good time. The premise is simple yet funny and there aren't a bunch of annoying clichés that bring it down. The story is kind of ridiculous and unbelievable but if you enter the movie with an open mind then you have a better shot at enjoying it. The screenplay itself offered some funny dialog and a few interesting characters. Some of them were really annoying and unnecessary while some of the other ones were actually relatable and fun to watch on screen. Behind the camera, Steve Pink did a decent job. He followed a familiar path but he at least kept the film interesting. He moved the movie at a decent pace and it never became too dull or cheesy. The ninety minutes flew by fast and the ending was actually pretty good. It may have been a bit over the top but it also finished with a bang.The acting was surprisingly good given the genre. Justin Long was pretty good as Bartleby Gaines. He was charismatic and for once his character wasn't a complete loser. I hope he gets more leading roles in the future although he should probably stick to comedy. Blake Lively was just bland and she looked really bad next to Justin Long. They just didn't look realistic together and her performance was so mundane that it sounded like she was reading her lines. Jonah Hill was pretty good and he had many funny lines. Adam Herschman was just annoying and completely unnecessary. Lewis Black was good just a bit over the top though. The rest of the performances were fine, they're just not worth mentioning. Overall, I thought Accepted was a decent comedy. It's a good film to watch for a few laughs just don't expect too much. Rating 6/10",Accepted

51,higherall7,Majoring in 'Winging It',8,25 June 2014,"There are characters in movies that I immediately identify with and I must admit Bartleby Gaines is one of them. I felt the same pang of recognition as when I watched Jimmy Rabbitte organize his Soul Music Band in Dublin, Ireland in 'The Commitments', or when I watched the little shoeshine boy challenge The Cincinnati Kid to a game of pitching pennies at the end of that movie. 'Hey, that's like me!' or 'Yeah! That's like something I would do!' The truth is 'winging it' has its limitations and sooner or later every student of this subject must eventually pay the piper, no matter how artistic or expert he becomes with this form of discipline. But we true believers of the Faith love it when we see anyone confront a difficult situation with spontaneous creativity rather than the rules or guidelines that come out of some standard textbook. Any artistically inclined person easily relates to the type of creative energy and thinking outside of the box that proves to be Bartleby Gaines' forte. While also appreciating how such aptitudes when not properly supervised can lead to the ill gotten gains of the Confidence Artist amongst others.This movie has lots of nice bits of business in it that brought to mind Robert Donat's improvised speech while on the run from the long arm of the Law in 'The Thirtynine Steps' or Bill Murray's declaration in the middle of the movie 'Quick Change' when he stumbles into a den of thieves and states 'We came for the MONEY!'. You can't help but root for Bartleby and his gang of college rejects as they work the system on behalf of rejects everywhere.Some people love to uphold and defend the Status Quo and other folks are born and bred to defy it. This film lightly explores the uneasy tension between these two groups with often hilarious results. The premise may seem improbable, but I seem to remember when some upstarts seeking the rights and privileges of titled gentlemen and freedom from the Royal Elite thought they could take on the whole of the British Empire and win out. We all know what happened to them. I think all this occurred in some backwater on the East Coast of North America centuries ago.Anyway, the concepts of inclusion and exclusion, inculcating learning to serve the needs of the society at large through authoritarian means and tailoring learning to serve the needs of the individual and the soul on a non-authoritarian basis, are played upon in the scatological vein for laughs and touches upon some interesting insights without putting a damper on any of the fun. There are even a couple of wry nods made to the principles of 'Teaching With Love and Logic' although if you blink you'll miss them.The ending comes across as the adolescent's version of 'Mister Smith Goes to Washington', but I think I've said enough.

Justin Long was the star and I like Justin and think he did a really good job, Travis Van Winkle played the snobby frat boy here and did a great job too.

I loved that when he got rejected to every where he applied to he took things into his own hand and ended up making a college mostly at first so he could lie and make his parent proud but by the end he loved his college that he made and his parent were still proud of him. The college he made happen to make a lot of other student and people happy becuse they found a place where they could do whatever they dream instead of getting rejected.

58,jdollak,Considerably more fun than would be expected,7,30 May 2008,"Now and then I get in the mood for a teen comedy. I've found that things like the American Pie movies have moved toward an approach that is both heavy-handed and overly reliant on absurd plot movements. While we all know how Accepted is going to end, it's very charming as it makes it to that conclusion. Sure, a lot of the jokes aren't especially funny, but they are also not the type that make you groan with how predictable the line was. There is also a pleasing message to this. When I consider my college days, I don't think I learned too much. I learned technical things, but the responsibility lessons had already been learned by the time I reached college. The one thing that taught me the most about how to function in the real world was playing in a garage band during high school. And this is what the movie explains. The best thing was can do for ourselves is make an effort to learn.Lewis Black does a nice job in the movie. He isn't quite up to the standards of his appearances on The Daily Show, but his appearance is appreciated. The worst part of the movie is very close to the end - the big monologue goes a little too far, undermining the point of the movie.This is also pretty clean for a teen comedy. No nudity and less cursing than would be expected.A commendable teen comedy for those who have recently grown out of American Pie.",Accepted
59,oshram-3,Far better than expected,8,20 August 2006,"On the face of it, any teen comedy runs the risk of being sophomoric and obvious, and fair enough, most of them are. There are a few that have risen above the usual banality of the source material (Bring It On, Eurotrip), and they give me hope that others can join that depressingly rare crowd of teen comedies that are actually funny and not just an excuse to flash some starlet's boobs or be a vehicle for some never-was like Tom Green.Enter Accepted, directed by John Cusack pal Steve Pink and led by the likable Justin Long (the smart nerdy kid in Galaxy Quest and more recently featured in Apple computer ads), about a bunch of kids who don't get accepted to college and decide, as disclosed in the trailer, to fake a bogus one to get their parents off their backs. When they go a little too far with the website and other kids end up enrolling, the kids have a few problems to solve.Okay, the set-up is obviously preposterous, but most comedy lives or dies in the execution, and here, Accepted does pretty well. Long's Bartleby Gaines (mostly shortened to 'B') is accompanied by enough well-meaning comically acceptable friends to help him share the load, but probably the best supporting character is 'Dean' Lewis (no doubt named as an homage to Rodney Dangerfield's Dean Martin), aka Uncle Ben, Lewis Black, who is wisely restricted to short spurts where he can rapid fire his unique brand of cranky observational humor. Black is terrific here, frankly telling the kids what life is really like (his expletive-laden final line is hysterical) and providing the adult face to the bogus university for the parents.But Long has to carry most of the film, and he does so, in spades; Bartleby is easily identified with and we take to him almost immediately. A nice twist was provided by Columbus Short's character Hands, an athlete who loses his scholarship due to an injury and ends up becoming the de facto art faculty at the fake college. Also noteworthy as Bartleby's hyper-intelligent and sarcastic little sister is Hannah Marks.Yes, the film does feel familiar in some spots; there's a debt here owed, of all places, to Revenge of the Nerds. Those who are rejected by everyone else find a home with Bartleby and his cohorts, and of course the villains are steroid-enhanced conformist Master Race types who run a fraternity (well, okay, frats are evil) and seek to humiliate and bury the oddballs for the  gasp  crime of being different. But that aside, Accepted has fun with the material, and even asks a few decent questions about the expectations on college kids and the course of higher education. Not that it's a brain teaser by any means, but Accepted isn't just another mindless teen comedy (or Owen Wilson vehicle). It's a funny, clever 90 minutes that, while not a great departure from its genre, is intelligent and creative enough to be very enjoyable.There is at least one moment of unadulterated brilliance in the film, when Bartleby checks out a nearby college in an attempt to harvest ideas for his own school's curriculum. When he sees that the kids are all stressed out at the other school (several refuse to even talk to him during class for fear of missing something), he shakes his head, thinking that there must be a better way. As he moves to leave he is met by a stream of kids going the other way, one person moving against a human tide, while in the background, the opening lines of Eleanor Rigby play. Perhaps an unplanned moment of brilliance, but brilliance none the less.",Accepted

After paying my six dollars to go see a matinée showing of this film I sat down and was treated to one of the best college life movies ever made. I laughed hard and almost through the entire movie. It is no Animal House but for our under educated generation this is a smart film that shows that maybe life is more important than college. The only thing that holds this film up from being legendary is the fact that it is only rated PG-13, if they had went for the stronger R rating I think this film could have became a movie that would leave a legacy on it's viewer as the aforementioned Animal House has.

63,btm1,Better than it has a right to be,6,31 October 2009,"I thought that this would be at best an ""Animal House"" type film or at worst a typical slacker comedy. Well, it certainly isn't as uproariously funny as ""Animal House"" (with the incomparable John Belushi) was when it first came out, but it has a thought provoking message.Good comedies (as well as good thrillers) require surprising audiences with a scene taking a turn they didn't expect. Repeated imitations of an original comic situation can lead to the original film not holding up well over time. Other than Animal House, the slacker movie genre seems stale. While ""Accepted"" is basically a slacker movie, it also displays some of the irony of the expectations of a college education. As a result the film, despite its plot's inherent ridiculousness, is better than many of the slacker movies that preceded it.There are various reasons for wanting a college education. Probably the foremost reason is it can lead to better jobs. There are many careers, such as medical doctor or engineer, in which a practitioner will utilize much of the specialized course material learned as an undergraduate, and some even will make use of knowledge gained in graduate school. But my experience is that many employers use a college degree requirement simply as a filter. The employee might not utilize any of the stuff he learned in college, but the degree demonstrates an applicant's ability to learn, or at least to complete a goal. Probably most college graduates will find that in their employment they will use little of the course work they completed in college. Getting a degree is like getting your ticket punched.When there are more job openings than applicants, society can elect to loosen requirements. For example, a shortage of graduates from medical schools has led to the creation of career opportunities such as Nurse Specialist and Physician's Assistant that allow people to practice medicine without all the graduate education required for a Doctor of Medicine degree.But when there are more new college graduates than job openings, the fence gets raised and a Masters Degree may become the new filter. Young people who spent four years of their lives going to college may find that they are competing for the same low-pay jobs as people with only H.S. educations but who have 4 years more work experience. Some decades ago India had a problem of graduating many more engineers than that nation had job openings for. Colleges are often a little late in providing educations tailored to the current job opportunities, and then late again in switching off their production lines when employers' need for those graduates have been satisfied.A different reason for attending college is social. It is a place to get away from your parents, to meet new people and have new experiences, and to make contacts who in later years will become a support network. Often your network of friends will be the best way of finding new job opportunities. I suppose that higher quality colleges will provide students with higher quality contacts who will end up with more power to help their friends.A third reason for attending college is a desire for learning. While most English Literature and History majors will not find careers in those fields, they will benefit in other ways from being educated. A Democracy needs educated citizens. Included in this is stretching the mind by learning new ways of looking at things, and also fostering creativity and innovation.""Accepted"" makes a case for a school devoted to fostering creativity and allowing students to explore their interests. Rather than following a high-school-like fixed curriculum, the students design their own curriculum. To some extent this is akin to the old English Universities where students were responsible for their own learning. The important difference is that in Oxford and Cambridge professors are available for guidance and to get a degree your advisers must be satisfied with your level of knowledge.""Accepted"" also points out that some bright people don't get accepted to an affordable 4-year college because they didn't apply themselves to study in high school, not because they aren't ""college material."" ""Accepted"" is still a slacker comedy and its more serious side is not all that serious, but it can make you think, which is more than most slacker movies do.",Accepted

According to them, teens must be shallow, thoughtless clones that trudge along aimlessly preparing to sink the world with their complete and utter disdain for anything in this world with any substance. Whatever happened to the days of John Hughes and ""The Breakfast Club"" or ""Sixteen Candles""? Those times are clearly overor perhaps not. If you will remember, Hughes is most famous for a series of intelligent teen comedies from the eighties. They were heartfelt, meaningful movies. ""Accepted"" is one of the closest comedies to those Hughes to be released lately. It transcends the boundaries of the modern teen comedy set by such movies as ""American Pie"" (one of the very few good teen comedies to be released in the last decade or so) by showing off a certain meaningfulness that is lacking in teen movies today.Bartleby Gaines (Long) is a high school reject who has just gotten rejected from his eighth and final college choice (not to mention, his back-up school). Now, he has nowhere to go come fall semester and, taught that college was the only way to go, feels as though his life has just been ruined. To appease his over-bearing parents, Bartleby decides to make up his own college--the South Harmon Institute of Technology. His friend, Sherman Schrader (Hill), helps him by creating a websitea fully-functional one at that. Soon, hundreds of students turn up ready for college--all of them rejected by every other school they applied to. But, when a neighboring school wants to bulldoze the building being used for the college, Bartleby and his friends run into a huge problem: the greedy Dean Van Horne (Anthony Heald) who will do anything to achieve the beautiful entranceway for his college. The only way to stop the place Bartleby has grown to love is to get official accreditationbut that is easier said than done.Justin Long is a quirky, but solid actor. He first got my attention with such movies as the ""Galaxy Quest"" and the creepily effective ""Jeepers Creepers"". He showed his versatility as an actor as the very flamboyant secretary in the mediocre ""The Break-Up"". Here, he is pretty much back to the same old thing, but he is very good at playing the awkward, but sympathetic teenager. Blake Lively just recently made her major acting debut in ""The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants"". In that movie, she gave an emotionally-stirring and very competent performance that surprised me considering how fresh she was to the acting trade. Here, she decided to take on a lighter, breezier role. It didn't require much from her, but she did with it what was required. Adam Herschman is, to my surprise and pleasure, one of the funniest people in the castand this is his first acting project ever. He steals every scene he is in and never seemed artificially comical. His performance seemed very naturalwhich makes me wonder what this guy is like in real life. Overall, this cast works quite effectively and helps us relate more to the characters.And the award for most ridiculous and completely implausible plot goes to...""Accepted""! This film's plot is so utterly unconvincing and over-the-top ridiculous that I am surprised at how effective the movie was. It would take a legion of completely idiotic people to make this movie's idea work. The ending had me chuckling at how unbelievable it was. This was easily the biggest problem with the movie. There is no way that a recently-graduated teenager and a few friends could fool not only their parents, but three-hundred students and their parents as well. It's absurd. However, ""Accepted"" manages to somehow make its plot seem plausible enough to keep the viewer invested in its characters. In the back of my head, I knew the movie was ultimately absurd, but I just didn't particularly care until after the movie ended and, by that time, it just didn't matter. Overall, I was just happy to see a teen comedy that didn't rely completely on sex and fart jokes (there were a few, but they were not the predominant fuel for this film's fire). It has a meaning behind it and that meaning is very relative in the lives of teenagers today.Final Thought: I was able to forgive its implausible plot due to its heartfelt and solid meaning.Overall Rating: 7/10 (B+)",Accepted

Some parts of the movie were funny and 'Gossip Girl' Robin Lively's character Rebecca Moreland was cute back then, but then again this was 2006 and Lively wasn't really known. Long's character was named Bartleby Gaines. Who would name their son 'Bartleby'? In the movie, he was a student who was rejected by every college, so he lied to his parents that he was accepted into one and he used his dad's college money to renovate an old Psychiatric Hospital and turn it into a college.

This movie was disappointing.Being a fan of Justin Long after watching WAITING and DODGEBALL I thought this one would very much make me laugh also. Quickly noticing the same jokes that I would see in previous movies such as ""Your adopted,"" I just only hoped it would get better. It seemed like the only funny parts were marketed in the trailer.I do admit that I did laugh a few times (mainly forced laughs), but I wanted the movie to end after about 50 minutes. The writing was lame and the plot and conflicts were typical.This won't stop me from watching other Justin Long movies. I still think his funniest performance was his role in Dodgeball. I would recommend actually giving this movie a try because a lot people out there doesn't mine overused humor.

71,quiqueperezsoler,"Bafflingly underrated and creative satire of colleges with quirky characters, great music and loads of fun",10,12 April 2020,"After reading the premise of the movie you can't help but imagine the sort of movie that it's going to be, yet it turned out to be so much more. Aside from the almost null probability of pulling off the creation of a college out of thin air, it never tries to explore what it takes to make it real. We never see the bathrooms being fixed, the parents doubting their kid's education more often, not to mention the fact that no educational or government authority suspect a thing of it all until some student finally snitches on it. The chances of allowing such institution to continue are non-existent but the movie doesn't trouble itself in making it work.The movie shines for many other reasons. It provides incredibly entertaining characters enhanced by the astounding performances of everyone in the cast. But above all, the endearing lead character or lead characters that propel the story and the idea of such a school forward in the most optimistic way providing an opportunity for more like them to find their place and make them feel like they belong somewhere.The movie is smart, it's not trying to pull some elaborate scheme taking advantage of the system or other people without ulterior motivations or purpose. The fact that they are rejects of society and education and seeing how what began as the most slacking alternative to a very hard truth that is not being accepted to any colleges (public or higher leagues, and this is a very important highlight) turned out to be a haven for others like them is a sad but optimistic reality. If they were just slackers it wouldn't be that impactful but the fact that these kids turned out to be the victims of very common mistakes of their past provides a lot of depth to them. They represent the victims of many common mistakes students make during High School that haunts them for the rest of their lives and that are really hard to foresee before you make them: not applying yourself more to ensure your academic future. Mistakes like not studying more to get a higher grade or, in case of the US, not doing more sports or playing an instrument or volunteering more. Underneath the great witty dialogue, incredibly well-realised characters and interesting subplots; there's a deep and serious critique at the bar set by the standards of colleges in the US (more especially the Ivy League members, which I think it's what the rival college in the movie is supposed to represent, I guess).I've got nothing against college, I myself am a student at the moment and I love and respect the institution and the purpose of it. I've had a great experience that I got nothing to complain about for the most part, but like with any organization it has downsides to it. But please, the curriculum in this made up school is a joke. But that's just it, it's only meant for comedic purposes, this movie is not about exploring the possibility of creating the perfect college for us without rules or guidelines, it's a satire on the downsides of the higher education system. On the sort of knowledge you learn in colleges that may only serve to complete your curriculum and would provide nothing useful when you start working. We can see the satire of this in the only class we are showned at the rival college, it's a satire on the typical dull-taught classes that are compulsory for some programs and it also shows the two kinds of students you can find in them (the overstressed ones and the snoozed ones).This movie is subtly brilliant, some people might not like the lead actor or won't find any of the jokes funny but I consider it to be incredibly well crafted and thought out. It's not meant to take itself too seriously, it was not meant to play by the rules of the possibilities of such thing ever happening, it simply happened for the audience to have a blast of a time and for current or past college students to dream in how it could have been. Honestly I have nothing bad to say about it, if you see it for what it is and ignore plot inconsistencies and even a sometimes convenient love subplot then it's a hell of a movie. After learning magic at Hogwarts I know where I want to go to college next.",Accepted

Justin Long has really never done comedy like this, where he's sarcastic and clever and I loved it. Lewis Black....enough said. The ending I really did love because It had to take itself seriously I mean how else would you end it? Yes it's another underdog story but not in your typical format and the movie wasn't their ups and downs, it was people coming together for one common goal, To go to college where they were accepted. The cast was amazing and yes I did laugh at loud when I didn't think I would and the laughter lasted longer then I thought to. The parents and sister played their roles well but their characters are put in when necessary. The movie was not focused around them but at the same time they showed up when you expect and not expect them to. They played in to the story very well, and I loved the familiar faces Anthony Heald(Boston Public), Jeremy Howard (I) (Galaxy Quest with Justin Long) Ross Patterson (The New Guy)and Sam Horrigan (Brink). Blake Lively added her certain something to the movie which made it even more enjoyable, as well as B's Friends.

This film tries to disguise its intentions behind a supposedly new concept - making up a new college for those who fail to be accepted at real colleges.Those who watched both Animal House and this wannabe could spot the similarities. At least I could. Bartleby is another smooth talking, quick thinking Otter. Sherman is another fat, pathetic Flounder. Maurice the Pizza Guy resembles D-Day, and Glen looks somewhat like Belushi but acts like he's had a lobotomy. They steal the concept of Otter getting beat up by the frat boys and give the honor to the fat guy. The trial towards the end took the cake, and it was the snobby squeaky clean frat boys against the misfits again. The misfit audience breaks out into applause for their smooth talking representative, who stands up and tries to calm them down. With these Animal House scenes shamelessly stolen one can't help but wonder - can't the producers of these wannabe movies keep it all ORIGINAL? I find teens who act ""over the top crazy"" lame and unbelievable. There's just phony written all over it. Are all these new kids who ride their motorcycles into pools, break open walls with mallets and do skateboard stunts taken straight out of Jackass tryouts? And they are made to do these idiot stunts all at the same time at one point to try to jolt audiences into laughter. Teenagers who try to do slapstick just aren't funny, especially when an entire school is full of these pranksters.But through all the ridiculousness, there are some funny lines in here. And the A.D.D. kid was a clever original idea with balls in this PC world. I give this movie an extremely generous 4 out of 10.

77,puttputtk,a new kind of college comedy,8,25 June 2010,"Accepted (2006)5 word summaryCollege rejects start fake collegeAfter being rejected from every college Bartleby decides to make a fake college to fool his family. A problem with the fake website lets everyone and anyone get enrolled in the college. When everyone starts showing up for their first day of school Bartleby decides to go with it and run his college in a new way. To start off Accepted is very funny and its also much different then many college comedies. Most college comedies tend to make the whole film about sex and drugs. This film has a point that it sticks to, its fun, but it doesn't loose track of its moral. It shows how messed up the college system is. How students pay their tuition and take the classes they have to, not the classes they want to. Fraternities treat people terribly, students get stressed, and how everything is a race and it doesn't pay off for everyone. Many of the points are made while showing Bartleby walking threw the colleges. Other points are made by Lewis Black during his rants. Justin Long's performance is one of his best. He is really funny and sarcastic in a way he isn't in most roles. Lewis Black, though his performance is the same as his stand up, is hilarious and is an important part of the film. Jonah Hill has the best role in the film, he's hilarious and possibly the funniest he has ever been, even close to Superbad. Almost all the really funny lines come from him and without him the film wouldn't have been as goodIt's a good, new style of college comedy that was needed to freshen up the otherwise clichéd and predictable genre.

First, I couldn't quite stretch my imagination far enough to buy into the idea of a bunch of college outcasts creating a bogus university from scratch. The sheer number of outlandish ideas this film asks you to believe is too vast to delve into. Second, this film is completely one-sided. It's a spit in the face of traditional higher education. Bartelby brings up some stimulating points during his final rah-rah speech in front of the approval board, but that does not change the fact that he committed a serious federal offense (fruad to the enth degree) and thought he could get away with it.

""American Pie"" and its sequels make light the idea of having sex before leaving High School, mix in some gross humor that makes it look like the Farrelly Brothers got a hold of the script and added some creative touches and you have an instant, been seen before Teen Sex Comedy.It's been done before seriously, too. How many teen dramas do we see where everything feels like its a cookie cutter cutout of an after school special? This is for once, a movie that doesn't take itself too seriously, but doesn't take itself too gross to be very funny.Accepted is the story of Bartleby Gaines (Justin Long) who, gathering by the title of the film, hasn't been accepted into any colleges, although for his friend, Sherman (Superbad's Jonah Hill) he's getting into the Harman College. In order to avoid disappointing his parents any longer, Bartleby creates a fictional college to surprise his parents that he's been accepted, and from there on, it leads into a college that I myself would want to actually hope to get accepted to. (Oh, but we can all dream, can't we?) Accepted is one of those kinds of movies where you are not supposed to believe everything could be realistic. Finding a building coincidentally close to another college and make it a realistic sort of place? Being able to create a school with only an ingenuity that a real genius would have to have? None of this stuff should be taken seriously. If this were a drama movie, you still couldn't take it seriously. This is a clever teenage comedy that skimps by on the sexual content and makes a very intelligent movie about education, fun and finding what it is you want to be. You see some women in bathing suits, and some sex jokes are here and there, but it's nothing cringe inducing, it's all for laughs, and most of all, it's better than any movies that have come out that I would allow a young crowd to watch, at least 14-15 year olds, compared to the American Pie movies where you should probably be graduated to understand, comprehend or even see the jokes.If you like comedies where you shouldn't have to skip through the scenes because of heavy in detail kissing or sexual content you can't believe got into a PG-13 movie, see this movie.

A bunch of slackers fail to get into college and as a result form their own. The picture didn't however hit big with the public, bombing at the box-office and it's not particularly hard to see why. Whilst the film has a good idea and a solid teen cast, Accepted only shows how a tepid script and flaccid direction can undermine the quality of any production. When ""B"" (Justin Long) fails to get into any college much to the disappointment of his parents, he along with a group of his pals decide to set up their own the South Harmon Institute of Technology (or S.H.I.T....lame alert!!!) in order to make them look better in the eyes of their mothers and fathers. However neighbouring colleges don't like the party all day attidude of S.H.I.T and promptly it's combo of bikini babes, drunken fiestas and general craziness is put under inspection. The performances in Accepted are all fairly adequate, Justin Long is a likable (if a tad bland) in the lead, Jonah Hill is a scene stealer as his brain box best friend and Lewis Black provides a few chuckles as the fake hired Dean for the newly ""opened"" university. The rest of the characters are within themselves clichés, kooky girl, sports jock, hot chick with feelings and idiot with a talent. We've seen these presentations of youth a thousand times before in Animal House, American Pie, Road Trip and more recently Superbad. Accepted has as good a plot as any of those pictures, but it's constant recycling of their jokes and characters makes it far harder to warm to. The villains are all snooty and aryan, but not one is given a character. Even mediocre teen flicks like Road Trip and Slackers manage to present us with a total bastard of a bad guy, Accepted has nothing... Steve Pink's direction is uninspired and really has nothing unique to it's name. He frequently shows wasted ""party dudes"" doing outrageous stuff and sexy girls stripping down to skimpy bikinis but that won't satisfy anyone over the age of 16. The script is pretty lame, several gags do work quite well and Jonah Hill has a whole barrage of cheeky one liners but you won't find yourself laughing that often. Even smiles are scarce during the pictures rather short 89 minutes, more often than not your just bored. The idea would have been far better under the careful eyes of the Weitz brothers are Judd Apatow, the creative team here have done well to come up with the idea but in it's actual construction have fired far to many blanks. The PG-13 rating doesn't even allow for a raunchy style of humour, sex jokes are rare and generally juvenile and weak in Accepted. Indeed the only real one I remember is a hot girl who names her special skill as taking her clothes off, thats it.... Fans of the genre may find some stuff to like about the picture, and those to young to legally watch without a guardian might think it ""totally awesome"". The truth however is very dustant from that, Accepted is dull and if we're being brutally honest deserved the backlash and failure it received.

The kids make it up twist recalls 'Camp Nowhere'.The superficial spoofing of an American sacred cow, though, brings to my mind the mostly bad, 'Hamburger, the Motion Picture'. But, hey -- I enjoy re-watching Hamburger. The schlock is engaging.Unlike Van Wilder, which was well written with likable characters, Accepted seemed to be a situational comedy. The situations are funny, and mostly well done. I would like to have had more reality to the characters.Like Hamburger, stereotypes abound and are exaggerated for comic effect. There isn't much storytelling art here, the motivations are printed on the character's forehead (in the case of the A.D.D. student, almost literally). Justin Long rushes through at least one 'zinger' that deserves to be quoted, both for comic effect in the story, and for larger reasons, something like 'I noticed you keep your blatant anti-Semitism under the rug and keep a tight hand on it'. This barb is well-placed in the story, if unclear as to why it is there. Also like Hamburger: The Motion Picture, Accepted uses lesser-known actors, some intended to look like known stars. Hamburger and Accepted are both about an alternative college experience for college rejects.With all the stereotypes and the negative images, this film takes a higher road to humor. The juvenile bathroom humor is limited to an abandoned bathroom that no one is brave enough to clean. Sex is limited to light 'first date' kisses (and one exaggerated art piece). Drinking is inferred -- you don't see behavior under the influence, just kegs arriving, and people waking up after the 'big party'. The humor is about the kids finding a fictitious refuge. Other than the concept of the school, the characters stick to ethical and legal behavior. This is a nice touch for coming-of-age exploitation films.",Accepted

But honestly this movie is funny, it won a good rating for me which I was shocked. Although I gave ""The Illusionist"" ****, I think I enjoyed ""Accepted"" much more. It was funny, Corky and just stupid but in a great way. A young kid (Long) applies to every college but is sadly turned down, the good part is he makes up his own college with his buddies. And a nice little cameo there by Lewis Black as the angry dean, no acting there since he screams his lungs off nonstop on stage. ""Accepted"" isn't fully original but it's enjoyable enough to just say I laughed out loud, especially with that chubby kid screaming like a girl and in the hot dog suit. - **1/2",Accepted
94,Bosco-HK,Everyone deserves some fun...,7,30 November 2006,"I enjoyed this movie very much. Everyone was very impressive, Bartleby Gaines (Justin Long), Sherman Schrader (Jonah Hill), and Uncle Ben (Lewis Black) were extremely hilarious. I felt very sad for Sherman Schrader while watching the movie. He's probably a computer nerd but was so gullible. Bartleby's parents, Jack Gaines (Mark Derwin) & Ann Cusack (Diane Gaines) played their roles very strongly. They were extremely disappointed about their son not being able to be accept to any colleges. And later on, they fell for the news and details of the 'new school' and also the 'Dean's words'. The 'Dean's words' were extremely funny at some points where he added bad language.In all, everyone displayed their characters very well. I love one character in particular though.The character Lizzie Gaines (Hannah Marks) in Accepted (2006) is very annoying to watch in this movie because she just almost spoils every plan up. And I enjoyed especially the part where she sat in the car and as her parents drove her back after leaving B. Gaines at 'his' college, she did 'sign language'. The 'sign language' she did made me laugh like crazy. And I thought she would be checking up on him more often and reporting back to his parents and that ""B"" had to make up more scenes and ideas to lie to his parents. But that did not happen unfortunately. However, for a 'straight-A-looking student' she was one-time really mischievous: she was at the 'counter' and ordering her drink, also she has her own master plan 'fake-to-gain-ability-to-order-a-drink'. She played her role extremely well. She is very talented indeed.Question: Was the bathroom ever cleaned again anyways? I was engrossed in all the humor.The ending however was a little harsh on the English language in front of an educated board of administration. Overall, I think that the movie is very entertaining. Although fraud is not a good teaching in a movie, the idea that everyone should build their interests while attending college is an important issue. ""Your future lies in your own hands and you should not let others influence the way you learn."" (quoted just-so if it was taken from someone famous) but you must also remember to conform to the rules of education, the school's curriculum and city/country you are currently studying in.",Accepted
95,svetlastoyanova,Who would have thought collage is so much fun...,10,27 March 2008,"Accepted is one of the best teenage comedies I have seen in a long time. It has an original script, talented cast and it delivers an hour and a half of pure unadulterated fun.It tells the story of a high school graduate Bartleby ""B"" Gains (Justin Long) who is not accepted in any of the collages he applied to, so to avoid his parents' disappointment he creates a fictional collage. In the attempt to fool his parents completely he creates a fake website and turns an old psychiatric hospital into a school. Everything goes smoothly until a lot of other ""accepted"" students turn up on his doorstep. Now he and his friend have to figure that collage thing out not only for themselves but for the others too.Justin Long as a lead man is absolutely brilliant, his character is as natural as he can be and the supporting acts are outstanding- Jonah Hill as Sherman Schrader, Columbus Short as Hands, Maria Thayer as Rory, Adam Herschman as Glen and Lewis Black as Uncle Ben.The humour is fresh and simple and most importantly funny, right from the start to after the credits .The plot develops so easy that by the time you stop laughing at the last joke you start giggling at next other. Along with all the fun the movie brings a very common subject to our attention i.e. the collage education. If usually the students in the movie are united against the school government, in this case they are united by the mutual desire to go to school and learn.Yet the movie doesn't brand all other schools as wrong, it just shows that there is another way. You what they say ""If there is a will there is a way.And may be sometimes the children know better what they need than their parents.This movie is an unmissable little story about the great opportunities in life wrapped up in the best format possible.",Accepted
96,Angel-Shadow,Its far better than most people think,7,21 October 2006,"I hadn't been to the cinema for quite a while and when i did finally go Accepted was what i decided to see. Essentially accepted is not the deepest,meaningful film you'll ever see but i think its main strong point is that it is extremely easy to relate to, not just for American teenagers but in many countries worldwide. The idea of failure has always been something that scares people, however ""Accepted"" brings a light heartiness to it and shows even though you may fail, you can still succeed. Justin long is clearly the star of the show and carries along the plot nicely with satire and sarcasm all thrown in while still playing a serious role. I wont give to much away about this movie but i highly recommend close attention is paid to the dean of the new college as that is where the major laughs of this film can be found. Blake lively is simply smokingly hot in this film and compliments Long's performance, this is also true of Columbus short and Jonah hill playing his closest friends. This film may not be as good as ""The departed"" in the box office right now but i think it gets my vote as giving you your money's worth.",Accepted
97,ShiiStyle,Acceptable,7,2 September 2006,"This movie is careful not to step on any toes, although it does its best to ridicule the modern Ivy League establishment with silly exaggeration which, although not quite as sweet as an accurate portrayal would be, will definitely make you grin. Most of the movie seems to take place in a Saturday morning cartoon, but personally I found the storyline easier to believe than Little Miss Sunshine, Napoleon Dynamite, and kin. The scenes from South Harmon are certainly fun to watch and the movie never slacks off. If you want a college comedy to knock your socks off, you'd be better off seeing Animal House. But if you yourself are a high school student going through the admissions process or recently got rejected by your first-choice college, I think you'll find this movie a great choice to watch with your friends.

I've been seeing Justin Long pop up in a lot of films over the past few years, I figured with the right role he could break out. (Mac commercials not withstanding.) This film just might put him on a fast track to the A list. The rest of the cast also did their jobs perfectly, this is an excellent little film with a nice message. (But you don't need to buy the message to have a good time.) Lewis Black is, as usual, hilarious, and Blake Lively is a fresh faced beauty. Take a couple hours and see this film, they will not have been wasted.",Accepted
99,ss97-1,Better that most,8,9 September 2008,"I went in expecting another typical movie of the genre but came away very surprised. It is a classic? Well it might be close.Justin Long was his typical likable self, and pulls off the lead with flying colors. He is funny when he needs to be, and inspiring as the leader of the outcasts who are in need of a home.The plot is fairly original, it has some highs and lows but it keeps you interested in the outcome the entire time. The movie never seems to go over the top, and maintains a balance that most films of this type don't reach. It stays silly, but finds a workable realism that makes you feel like it could totally happen anywhere in any time.Lewis Black is very funny as the only true teacher at S.H.I.T. and does his usual shtick well within the tone of the movie. The rest of the supporting cast does very well. I did not see one real weak character mixed in and no moments of wishing them off screen.All in all it was a good movie. It is not overly hysterical but it does have some funny moments - it moves quickly but is not rushed - good characters and fun plot - bottom line is a decent chunk of entertainment value.",Accepted

While on one hand the South Harmon Institute of Technology students are self-described ""SH*THeads"" who want to do an awful lot of partying, they do manage to organise themselves, build a campus, be political, and above all drop out of the American rat race in which their parents are mindlessly trapped. The film very accurately blasts education-- Lewis Black tells parents ""you think your kids are here to learn, to create, to express and discover themselves? Hell no! There is one reason kids go to University...to get a high-paying job! We aren't interested in thinking."" The film is sincere and fun, has some good dopey recurring characters, and would actually make a decent film for a high-school film class (the swearing and sex stuff is pretty tame; the ideas are thoughtful).

101,supernick-3,Surprisingly good,6,14 July 2009,"You're not going to gain any knowledge by watching this movie, but you won't be bored. More importantly, this movie doesn't contain any embarrassing moments like so many others of its kind, where you know that something is about to happen that makes you want to leave the room. Usually this happens when the plot reveals itself, and the secret is out. In this case, I'm happy to say that it's solved quickly and flawlessly, without exaggerating (like usually the main character works up an over-sized IQ and suddenly has connections everywhere). Nothing as drastic as that, and nothing as incredible as that.I will however never understand the educational system in the States. Here in Europe you cannot get rejected, and the yearly costs of studying (including living costs) are nowhere near the amount there. And it doesn't bring down the level, I can assure you of that.Anyway, this movie works if you just want to pass your time in a relaxed way.

The jokes weren't really funny and i didn't bust a gut at any of the scenes. The characters weren't intriguing and I didn't feel for any of them, even the dawky, fat kid with glasses who tried to enter the frat group. It was a good first watch, but it didn't blow me away and its not one that I would recommend.

103,forhall,Much better than my expectations,7,20 August 2006,"I saw the trailer and read some reviews, and I had low expectations for this movie. I was pleasantly surprised. While the plot is a little off-beat, everybody in the making of this movie pulled off a pleasant flick good for many a laugh. The writing and jokes are far more literate than I have come to expect. Better yet, they are delivered with aplomb by unknown actors doing a good job, all of them.The main reasons I wanted to see this movie were Justin Long and Lewis Black. Long is from ""Ed"" and the new Apple computer ads. He was just coming into his own as an actor in ""Ed,"" and he was excellent here. He's a natural in front of the camera. Lewis Black is a social commentator who pulls no punches. He's on ""The Daily Show"" on Comedy Central about once every two weeks, but he really shines in HBO's ""Red, White, and Screwed."" I regularly catch him on XM Radio's uncensored comedy channel. Give Black an idea and let him improvise. Whether his rants and lines here are scripted or improvised are no matter. He's priceless delivering his thoughts on middle class angst. One thing about Black's delivery, his hand gestures are not those of a comedian. It just seems like he's having a conversation with you, and I think that makes him unconsciously more effective.",Accepted
104,leereddy,Feel good comedy that's lacking in laughs.,6,21 August 2012,"Accepted is a fun, coming of age comedy about a wisecracking kid named Bartleby who gets rejected from every institute of higher learning he applies to. He then embarks on a ridiculous campaign of deception that basically involves duping his parents into believing that he has been ""accepted"" at a small, fictitious sister college, which incidentally becomes known as the South Harmon Institute of Technology - a facetious little bit of wordplay resulting in the acronym S.H.I.T. All manner of hi jinx ensue once the ball begins to roll and B's naive master plan begins to spiral out of control. The film inevitably journeys through a standard paint by numbers arc and at no point do you question the outcome, though you may question many of the films very flimsy plot holes. But alas, if you're watching this film for daring originality and surprise story lines then you should probably watch something else. In all it's a film that, demographically speaking, would appeal most to those whose age is close to that of the films characters. And, despite its fatuous story line and lack of any real laugh out loud moments, it still left me smiling. Oh, and a young Blake Lively cropping up at regular intervals certainly helped matters. That said, this film does little to show the potential of Jonah Hill, who seemed yet to have found his comedic feet, so to speak. I'm reluctant to delve too deeply into the films general ethos of ""be yourself"" and ""follow your dreams"" etc, because let's face it - it's a PG 13 comedy about a kid who starts his own college.Overall, a benign little film with lots of flaws but still worth a look.",Accepted

Gaines is a fun loving slacker who, unfortunately, gets turned down for every college he applied for, much to the charign of his overly expectant parents. So, with a little cutting and pasting, he creates the South Harmon Institute of Technology, and lo and behold, he is accepted (along with his friends Rory, Hands, and Glen, whose college plans were also all but dashed). However, his parents want to see the website, the campus, and the dean. So now he has his other friend Sherman (who has been accepted to the prestigious Harmon College) build a web page, they lease out an abandoned psychiatric hospital, and they hire Sherman's uncle Ben (played to perfection by comedian Lewis Black) to be the dean. Problem solved? Not quite. The web page was done so well, that hundreds of students show up at the front door, all of which were turned down by other colleges. Faced with no choice, Bartleby decides to proceed with turning South Harmon into a real college, and sets about figuring out what to teach and how to teach it. Meanwhile at Harmon, dean Van Horne meets with Hoyt Ambrose, a rich law student and head of the KBE fraternity (which Sherman is trying to become a member of), to discuss building a gateway for Harmon using land presently being used by South Harmon. He tries finding the leaseholder of the land, to no avail. Meanwhile, his girlfriend, Monica, catches him cheating on her, and a big party at South Harmon lures a chunk of Harmon's students away, including Monica into the arms of Bartleby. Now Hoyt uses Sherman, knowing he has been bouncing between the two schools, in an attempt to bring South Harmon down for good. However, Bartleby has an accreditation appointment with the state Board of Education to prove South Harmon's worthiness. Can he legally bring the South Harmon Institute of Technology to life and win the love of Monica?After being rejected every colleges he applied, Bartleby Gaines decided to create a fictitious university, South Harmon Institute of Technology, with his friends, to fool their parents.

It is the ultimate PG-13 romp, it is college as we imagine it will be when we're freshmen in high school, it requires so much suspension of disbelief that it may as well be taking place on Mars. It is so wholesome that even when it tries to be dirty it wouldn't make your grandmother uncomfortable.

109,nightswatch,what is going on here,2,1 November 2007,"Seriously, I don't understand how Justin Long is becoming increasingly popular. He either has the best agent in Hollywood, or recently sold his soul to Satan. He is almost unbearable to watch on screen, he has little to no charisma, and terrible comedic timing. The only film that he has attempted to anchor that I've remotely enjoyed was Waiting... and that is almost solely because I've worked in a restaurant. But I digress. Aside from it's terrible lead, this film has loads of other debits. I understand that it's supposed to be a cheap popcorn comedy, but that doesn't mean that it has to completely insult our intelligence, and have writing so incredibly hackneyed that it borders on offensive. Lewis Black's considerable talent is wasted here too, as he is at his most incendiary when he is unrestrained, which the PG-13 rating certainly won't allow. The film's sole bright spot was Jonah Hill (who will look almost unrecognizable to fans of the recent Superbad due to the amount of weight he lost in the interim). His one liners were funny on occasion, but were certainly not enough to make this anywhere close to bearable. If you just want to completely turn your brain off (or better yet, don't have one) then maybe you'd enjoy this, but I can't recommend it at all.",Accepted

I was rejected from my first choice Dartmouth, a college I was groomed to go to, and my parents ended up paying twice the tuition to go to St. Lawrence, which at the time was going through a strikingly similar renaissance depicted in the movie and where I went because of a cheerleader I knew.The characters are splendid - considering their newness they display a professional cockiness that only helps the viability.

It actually has some very good acting in it from Justin Long, who has been a favorite of mine since 'Galaxy Quest', and who really got his break in 'Dodgeball'. It actually made some very sophisticated points about what is the idea behind higher education anyway. Had he not made up the school, but rather found a school like this, I think it could have been a much better movie. And the South Harmon Institute of Technology acronym's was run into the ground.

The idea had potential, but the plot and turns are very by-the-numbers and the people behind it, like the students in the movie, were apparently content half-assing it.""Accepted"" is fairly harmless.

116,JesusTwinFish,Surprisingly Smart,8,3 October 2007,"When I first began watching the opening scenes of this movie I didn't really expect much. With the name ""Accepted"" and it being about teens just graduating High School I expected it to be just another predictable High School flick. Man, was I wrong. The persona this movie takes on ""High School teen comedy"" is not what it is entirely about; it has a different message behind it that it really wanted to get out. It seemed to take jabs at the current status quo of society - our education system and what we define as ""apporpriate"" for anything we undertake. Society has deemed that everything has it's own jurisdiction, and everything must be like everything else, even if it is different it must be molded to the status quo. Everything must be the same and we must be able to identify in order to feel comfortable. Which, is not true and it creates universal evils which this movie blatantly points out. It creates bores, people who really do things ""just to play it safe"" and not follow what they truly want. Of course, cutting of human beings natural tendencies to be spontaneous, fresh, and creative just creates those universal evils I listed above.Don't see this movie because you want to see a high school comedy, it has so much more to offer than that. For it is very intelligent and speaks the truth about the society which we live in. Listen to the guy who plays the Uncle, he is the truth speaker. Of course, Jonah Hill is also pretty good in his part as the insecure friend not to mention Justin Long shines in his part.Overall, this movie was surprisingly smart and has an underlying message that we should all try to learn from.",Accepted

123,sachinsethi-mib2011,Rejection- shove it up your A-S-S !!!,8,11 November 2011,"This movie deserved a better class of reviews and definitely a higher rating than it actually has. In my opinion, Accepted is based on one of the most relevant topic of our generation wherein the agony and feelings of all those students who due to one reason or another are unable to get accepted to a good enough college after completion of their high school. The central character played by Justin long who when unable to get accepted to any College starts an Unaccredited college along with a few of his friends so as to fulfill the expectations and dreams of his family. During the course of this, the whole lot of students like him which too were not accepted to any of the college come to this institute to pursue higher studies. This movie provides proper insight to our education system and its inability to carve innovation and fuel imagination in young fresh minds which wants only ""possibilities"" in life and a belief that they also can contribute to the development of world and change the face of time on their watch. The character played by the dean of South Harmon Institute of Technology was quite interesting and intriguing as its views presented about the existing system and world around may not please many but unfortunately are true. Also, the character of Sherman Schrader is also relevant in the current time as the person who is somewhat different may be in appearance or attitude is always met with hatred of others and becomes a misfit in the society of commons. Lastly, Justin long proved that he too can put by the act together and give a performance which can demonstrate its worth as an actor. He stuck the chord with connecting beautifully with the character of protagonist ""Bartelbey Gaines"". His speech at the end of the movie encapsulates the essence of the movie and packs a Knock -out punch in front of the panel before whom they had a hearing for accreditation. The line ""do not Judge us by the way we look"" is my personal favorite. Hence, I would rate it as 8/10.",Accepted
124,refolded,One-sided Ignorance,1,18 August 2007,"Synopsis: Kid is not accepted into any colleges. He creates a ""college"" where he and his friends can party by using their parent's tuition money. Wow. A Paean to ignorance. If you believe that we're all OK, man, then this movie is for you. Furthermore, you must understand that:1. Kids have it all inside them--they just need to let it out.2. Teaching really stifles the innate creativity that everyone is born with. 3. Someone else should pay for you to follow your passion. 4. 300 teenagers can live together in harmony, as long as you take away those restrictive rules. 5. Extemporaneous speeches are often much more convincing than a prepared presentation. 6. If the Board of Education allows you to open a ""charter school"" with ""nontraditional teaching techniques,"" it's because they have your best interests at heart. (Not that they are willing to let go of low-functioning students who will end up working fast food anyways.) This movie is one in the college comedy genre, i.e. Animal House. It follows the pattern pretty closely. What's new here though, is a complete attack on higher education, not a parody of the bad elements. It's missing the sympathetic insider, a professor who embodies the worthwhile part of university life. This lack of balance will doom this film to the back rows of Blockbuster. It is so one sided, that I wondered if it was an ironic self-referential take on the whole genre--for about one minute. The movie has no deep meaning, no layers, no introspection. It's as if they let some kids who never went to class do what comes naturally. And what is natural is what the name of the school is: S***. (Never thought I'd say this: Go see something with Will Farrell instead. His comedies can be surprisingly sophisticated.)",Accepted
125,CaptSC,"Despite its gimmick and stereotypes, I'll take it.",6,25 August 2006,"(The ""spoilers"" spoil nothing if you have already seen the trailer) A few hours ago, I was planning on going to see either Beerfest or Snakes on a Plane, but since my friends aren't seventeen yet, I couldn't, and we made a compromise for ""Accepted."" And you know, despite it's obvious flaws and shortcomings, but I'll take it. There were many funny moments, some ""feel-good"" moments, and a couple of attractive women. Since this is my first review, I'll try the best I can. I'll talk about the bad first and then the good later.If you've seen a trailer, you know the gimmick: An average kid doesn't get accepted into any normal college, so he makes his own. It is a simple idea, even gimmicky (in my opinion), but compared to standard comedic fare, it is slightly original (but not innovative). The other problems are immediately obvious, EVERY character is a stereotype. I know that directors and writers can't escape using stereotypes, but it is disappointing when my pre-movie prediction came correct, there are no original characters. NONE! The ending is also predictable, he gets the girl, etc. Nothing we haven't seen before in hundreds of other movies. Traditional college is also put in a negative light.Now to the positive: It's funny. Period. My friends couldn't stop laughing, and while I was more reserved than them, I found the movie to be overall likable and generally funny. There are many good moments that I won't spoil despite my having checked the ""spoiler"" box. The director/writer/whoever even found a way to use two ""F"" words! I felt genuine empathy for the characters, and there are some very attractive women, even though we don't get to see the ""good"" stuff (either a plus or a minus depending on your moral beliefs.So, is this movie worth the money? Yes and no. If you want to go with a bunch of friends for a cliché-ridden movie with some genuine humor, than this is a perfect movie to see. If you want to go to a ""good"" movie, then don't bother with dropping $6.75 like I did for the entertainment. That may seem like harsh criticism, but it really isn't. While cliché's and stereotypes abound, even I found myself wishing that there could be a college like this one.6/10 for genuine entertainment, but there are no innovations put on the table.

But to say that this movie has a totally original plot outline is a bit too much. I know that I've seen it mentioned on this board before, but this movie is incredibly similar to the plot from Camp Nowhere. The kids use their parents money and rent a facility for them to go to, and fool their parents into believing that it is a real camp/school. Instead of Christopher Lloyd, they used Lewis Black, both the characters are out of work extremist educators. But more similarities I feel can be drawn from many college movies. Starting with Animal House, and then you can add PCU, Old School, and Van Wilder. The students are doing something that is that different from the norm and they are threatened with expulsion and getting kicked out of their houses, etc. Allow me to restate the fact that I liked this movie and I thought it did a good job and was very funny, but it followed a time-tested formula.

And the rest of the movie is so predictable. I'm not going to spoil anything but think of the coherence: fake college with no license, parents, ""enemy"" college near them that wants the property. And in the background a love story of the protagonist. Many Hollywood movies, mostly teenage movies, lack of realism. But this one had gone too far.

135,supa_fun-1,I love Kiki,9,18 August 2006,"Diora Baird is absolutely hot as hell in this movie. But really all the characters are amazingly fun to watch.(MINOR SPOILERS) As per usual, the main character, B, is the sane one of the bunch. B has this crazy idea to make up his own college when he's rejected from all colleges he applies to. He's known for making fake IDs. so an acceptance letter is no problem.Because B's dad is a hard @$$ and suspicious of this university he's never heard of, B gets his friend Sherman to design a website for the university. Sherman has been accepted to a great college and is in fear of being arrested for fraud. He's very quick with witty lines but his flaw is he wants to be accepted socially too much.Glen, Hands, and Rory are the three stooges that follow B along. Glen got a zero on his SATs and has no thought process. He's constantly proposing battle royals, but he's very good at making smoothies, which gets him a lot of hot girls, somehow. Hands was a great football player who didn't receive the scholarship he was counting on, and turns to crafts to cover his lack of athletics. Rory was preparing to go to Yale since the 1st grade, and was not accepted. She spends her time meditating.Uncle Ben was my favorite character. Picture Lewis Black playing himself. If you have no reason to see this movie, then see it for Lewis Black and Jonah Hill. They're amazing.Monica is a B's love interest. As most of these stories go, she's more popular than him and doesn't even notice him until half way through the movie. Unlike many other stories though, B actually gets her and keeps her until the end. Monica is actually a good character on her own, but of course she's primarily there for B to adore.There are more supporting students at the made-up college who are fun to watch. A.D.D.'s name is self explanatory, and funny enough he ends up in the meditation class. Kiki is a hot ex-stripper who falls head over heels for a chance to go to school and eventually gets a crush on Glen. Maurice is an ex-military idiot who got his G.I. bill and wants to study rock n' roll in college. The final guy is only known as Freaky Student, who thinks he can blow things up with his mind. Ye who have little faith in him wait until the end of the movie.Of course the villains are the Dean of an opposing university, his university's student body president, the president's girlfriend, and their circle of friends.Every character is lovable.

It turns out the movie is dumb and formulaic with a concept so out-there, I could only acknowledge this movie as light fantasy. The characters who populate this fictional college turn it into the ""anti-college"", a more democratic school where the students are the faculty and they decide the curriculum. The movie is all about its rebellious against-the-system, against-the-norm attitude (Lewis Black is even cast as the ""dean"") but told in a family-friendly manner that it evokes ""School of Rock"" more than anything (besides the Belushi impression), except its not nearly as good nor memorable as Linklater's movie, nor ""Animal House"" for that matter. Actually, and oddly enough, ""Camp Nowhere"" is a more apt comparison. The movie's idealistic message only seems insightful when compared to the simplistic stereotypes of college the movie presents, and not actual college life or experience. ""Accepted"" features some laughs (for example, when the movie stops preaching and actually satirizes college experience in a couple scenes; and, Jonah Hill), but most jokes fall flat (for example, the school's acronym wasn't funny after the fifth time it was used). Surprisingly, the movie is sometimes charming in its dumb and playful manner, similar to its lead, Justin Long.

One thing that impressed me was that the soundtrack was pretty awesome and not the usual cheesy American pop-punk...They actually had real punk from back in the day like the Ramones...That in itself made the film better!

The message is that you do not need ""money, tradition, or fancy books- you just need a desire to better yourself."" they are a completely unorthodox school, but what the movie teaches is that thats still OK- and different (whether its a person or a school) is not necessarily bad, and that every one no matter should be given the chance to better themselves- despite whether they are 'weird.' its a message of non-comformity and has traces of anti-authority sprinkled in as well.

149,ShmuelReuven,Absolutely Hilarious! The Funniest Movie Since The 40 Year Old Virgin!,9,12 August 2006,"I've seen funny movies before in my life  recently, my favorites have been The 40 Year Old Virgin, Wedding Crashers, and most recently a little movie called Accepted! Accepted is so funny and so classic, I'm saying something very strong  it's this generation's Animal House. I know, I knowthem's fightin' words in some places, but it truly has that element to the movie  a college setting, tons of laughs, tons of gags, and some pretty hot women (including Blake Lively). What makes Accepted even better, it packs in the laughs with a PG-13 rating. Believe me, there are plenty of things that happen that don't make it seem like a PG-13  in fact, I truly kept thinking that I couldn't believe it wasn't an 'R' when I saw it.The film stars Justin Long as Bartleby 'B' Gaines, a senior in high school who's been trying to get accepted into any college. Unfortunately, he ends up not getting into any, much to the disappointment of his parents (especially his father). After his best friend, Sherman (Jonah Hill) finds out he's going to Harmon College, B has enough.He decides the only way he'll ever please his parents is by getting accepted, so he decides to make up his own college to fool them. He has Sherman build a fake website, he's written a fake acceptance letter, and convinced his mom and dad that the South Harmon Institute of Technology wants Bartleby Gaines as a student.If you haven't figured out already, the acronym for the school  S.H.I.T.  yes, you're reading that correctly. You see, B didn't think about the name too long; but, he's fooled his parents enough into thinking he's made it to a school and so his father gives him a check for $10,000.Of course, not thinking again, B must think of a way to fool the folks one more time  there's orientation and meeting with the dean and the professors of the school. He uses that money from his dad and rents out an old abandoned hospital with his other buddies, Roxy (Maria Thayer), Glen (Adam Herschman), Hands (Columbus Short), and Sherman. One of the most hilarious things in the film is when they first go inside the hospital to clean it up, Sherman screams uncontrollably reacting to a fake body falling from the ceiling - the noise that comes out of his mouth is priceless! The comedy continues when Lewis Black arrives on the screen; he plays the 'dean' of the South Harmon Institute of Technology. When a stint as a full-time professor at Harmon College didn't go as well as he expected, he was fired. If you've ever heard or seen the comic styles of Lewis, then you know he's got classic rants about anything and everything; he's most famous for his appearances on The Daily Show and his stand-up comedy tour. But, man does he know how to make you laugh.I'll warn you now  anytime he is on the screen, do not have anything in your mouth cause it'll end up on the head of the person sitting in front of you  and I don't mean in a nasty way. You'll be laughing so hard, you won't be able to keep your mouth closed!! With his parents happy, B is able to sit back and have fun. What ends up happening, there was a glitch on the South Harmon Institute of Technology website Sherman created  it turns out, by clicking in the 'Everyone Gets Accepted' box, everyone got accepted. As he and his friends are sitting around playing video games  a knock at the door  hundreds of kids who clicked on the S.H.I.T. website are waiting outside, each with their $10,000 tuition money. Without being ready, B and his crew must figure out a way to house these 'new students.' Of course, he also must now figure how to tell these people that this isn't a real school. Instead, he comes up with the plan to run the school  have the kids pick their own classes, and use the money they gave him for tuition to throw massive parties every night. And those classes - Slacking 101, Free Thinking 347 - the list goes on, but the gags keep rolling in! In Accepted, the antagonist is the real dean from Harmon College, Richard Van Horne (Anthony Heald). His plans are to turn Harmon College into an exclusive 'gentleman's college' like Harvard or Yale  only accepting the very best. To achieve his goal, the land where the South Harmon Institute of Technology must go. When B doesn't go along with those plans, Van Horne does a little digging and finds out the truth about the college  that it's not real.Accepted marks Justin Long's first role as the stand-out lead  he takes it and runs with it, just as B runs with his ideas for running his own school. There are some things Sherman gets into, trying to fit in with his potential fraternity brothers; Jonah Hill plays the part  you feel for him and you laugh at him. And if you ever see him on the streets  don't forget to 'ask him about his wiener.' There are really some moments in this movie that I have watched over and over and over again and just laugh  and I laugh hard every time I see them, and you will, too!! Plus, there is a good message that's learned.",Accepted

Is there no one making films for mature adults other than Scorcese?Pretty much nothing happens in the movie. There are no antagonists, no one dies, no one gets married, there are no explosions, no one gets kidnapped, saves the president, or fights aliens. It's just a movie that could have been better.I would have made a college that truly is for everyone and made it a drama - far more people would have come see it, I think.",Accepted
151,gonzooo,Surprisingly Good,6,6 June 2007,"I was actually quite surprised with how entertaining this movie was. When I first decided to watch it I expected nothing more than another American pie type teen movie with cheap toilet humour, but that wasn't the case. I think the reason why it exceeded my expectations was because of the original plot: A highschool grad who hasn't gotten excepted into any universities decides to start his own to satisfy his parents and before he knows it hundreds of kids like him are attending his fake university, a storyline that I don't think has ever been done before, and if it has I haven't seen it. However the movie did have some of the generic story lines that seem to run rampid in films like this: the cheesy love story between the cool chick and the dork, the almighty moral lesson learned at the end of the movie and so on, but for the most part this movie was pretty funny, (not always consistently, but funny none the less) I would recommend it to anyone looking for a light movie whos not in the mood for using to many braincells.",Accepted

Also, I love that Accepted is funny without being trashy. I don't care for gratuitous swearing and sex in movies and generally, there's just too much of both these days.The idea isn't totally original, its a bit like Animal House, in that the ""good guys"" are the underachieving losers, and the ""bad guys"" are the preppie, college frat boys. But it also has its original points, as well. And its funny.Look, if you're expecting something deep and meaningful, its probably not for you, if you want lots of gross humor and nudity, don't bother with this one, but you just want fun and frolics, with interesting, well acted characters and a solid plot, you'll want to watch Accepted.",Accepted

The writing alone carries this movie but the way each actor feeds of each other is second to none. I was surprised this was from the American Pie people because they usually recycle the same crap over and over and relabel it as something new.Not the case in Accepted. Even Justin Long's parents are humorous without even trying. His mother and father are never not together in the movie except for one scene and their 1-2-1-2 back and forth is solid.It is a constant debate with my friends and I whether or not the funniest lines come from Jonah Hill or Justin Long but the screaming scene with Jonah Hill is what everyone LOVES about this movie.The soundtrack is one of the best I've heard since Forrest Gump for the type of movie this is and seeing Justin Long (albeit brief) cover Blitzkrieg Bop by The Ramones in the movie was sweet.This movie is better than Old School, Office Space, Harold & Kumar and I'd even go as far to say as it being better than 40 Year Old Virgin.

The film is very slapstick, and over-the-top, as was 'Dodgeball', the film Justin Long will be most recognised from. The storyline is easy to follow, and believable to a certain extent, however in films such as this the storyline does not have to be believable. We see Justin Long and a group of his friends disappointed after being turned down from every college they applied to, so decide to make up their own, and as you can imagine things aren't quite as easy as A-B-C. There are some very funny laugh out loud moments as you would expect, even some 'im not pretending to laugh' moments as you quietly sit there hoping that your seat will eat you with embarrassment.

The film embodies the true values of college life and sways from the norm. I believe it truly captures the values of a college experience not structured around rules and regulations which is a nice change from our daily lives. The story is original to say the least. It is a nice change from the many films about love, super robots that cannot be controlled and superwomen and men with super powers. Although it is different it doesn't really open up many doors for new films to come out. Overall I thought it was a great film and recommend people to go see it.

""Scary Movie"" and ""American Pie"" being the sad standard of what passes for comedy these days, I wasn't expecting much from this one. I could tell you the entire premise and pitch of the movie before I saw it, but after having seen it, it was worth going. Long was actually VERY good in his first major starring role. His partners in crime (while being the standard 30 something Hollywood teenagers) were well cast and fun. I especially liked the jock who just wanted to carve wood, but has known nothing else for so long he had no idea what to do. Long's character reminded me of Carey in ""The Truman Show"", funny without being too slapstick (though you can only hit yourself in the nose so many times). The classic ""pretty boys"" college was cliché, but still fun. I'm glad this movie didn't have to stoop to the level that so many other BAD comedies do these days. It ranks up with ""Real Genius"", ""Animal House"" and ""Breakfast Club"" when it comes to fun, without being too crude or bordering on NC-17. Worth watching.",Accepted
164,darkawaii,Welcome to the South Harman Institute of Technology!,10,10 August 2006,"I have to say, it was a really good movie! It had humor, serious parts (though not many) and even a good message, and of course a feel-good ending, but hey, that's what movies are all about right? The premise? Bartleby Gaines (or B as they call him) fails to get in to every college he applies to. So what does he do? He creates one, and uses his parents tuition money and purchases a place, just for a false front to cover up his lies that he's been accepted at South Harman Institute of Technology.The movies was actually very good. I wasn't expecting much because it's one of those teen type movies, and I thought it would be 90% crass humor, but it was pretty decent, and worth it to pay to see the movie.Some of the jokes got old (well, only one set of jokes involving a stripper) but that's about the only thing I can say. Oh, and it's a bit unrealistic, the ending that is, but that's MOVIES. Since when are anything but biographies realistic, and even those are beefed a little.So B gets this old mental institution and turns it into a false school. He also gets Sherman to make a false website so that he can fool his parents even further. Of course, the website Sherman makes WORKS and a ton of students who up, each with checks for $10,000.00, giving the crew who faked this school about a million dollars. So of course they decide to stay open and make a school that is functional.Monica is, of course, the girl of B's dreams. Her boyfriend cheats on her, so she leaves him and develops feelings for B later on in the movie. They end up together, and of course, this angers the ex, causing him to look in to this new college he's never heard of.He finds out that Sherman is involved and basically beats the tar out of him to get info (this is one of the very few serious parts in the movie, made a few of the girls gasp in the theater) They don't show him beating Sherman up, but it happens and the next day Sherman is bruised about the face.B sees this (and also all the hazing that is done to Sherman, including dressing up in a giant hot dog outfit yelling at people to ask about his wiener), and feels horrible for how he (and other students) are being treated at this school that's supposedly so high class.In the end, due to Sherman's brains, they get a hearing with the people who decide and what schools can stay open, etc. They plead their case, and when accused of non-conventional means of teaching by the dean of the other school, he asks them what would be better? To inspire people to reach goals and dreams, to create passion for what they want to do, or to dump them in an institution that doesn't care about it's students and teaching them to settle for what's attainable and a sure thing.They (of course) end up winning the case with a few important lessons: -Don't be so quick to judge a book by it's cover -Just because something is unconventional, doesn't mean it's wrong, it's just different.And of course, B gets the girl (Monica) :P",Accepted

It is now a stepping stone that allows us to move onto a better job. This is unfortunate, but there is very little one can do about it.The movie is basically a dream-like idea of a rejected high-schooler making college as he sees it.

The college is the ideal place with you learning what you want or doing nothing. The school faces opposition from the proper college which ends up closing it down.

I never thought that that guy would be able to blow up a car with his mind, that was cool. There was a lot of people in the theater and i don't think that there was a moment when someone wasn't laughing. I'm not sure that it should have been rated PG i thought that it was more of a 14A movie. I like the part with the skeleton falling from the roof and when he goes around to see what people want to do with there time at collage the best. The one thing that i didn't see before is that South Harmon IT short is SH IT(i have to do it that why they don't like it). That is cool. Over all I think that this movie is so worth going to see at the Theater and buying on DVD.",Accepted
185,cavalier211,"AWFUL movie... not even funny, just made to turn a profit",3,23 April 2007,"I think it's very telling that all the posters who refer to this as a ""great movie"" or ""really funny"" have a vocabulary of about 7 words, and 4 of them are misspelled.I rented this movie, and really wanted to give it a chance. The trailers looked reasonably funny, and I thought the idea of a student creating their own college might lead to some good gags. I knew the plot was implausible, but I assumed they could get SOME humor out of it....I was wrong.For starters, I'm a 22 year old male who enjoys more than his share of bawdy college/teenage movies. I'm not some uptight jerk who blushes at a fart joke. Animal House is one of my favorite movies, and Eurotrip, Old School and Anchorman are a few of the flicks I am especially fond of. But...""Accepted"" was not only really bad, it was PAINFUL to watch. I think that the few times when I actually chuckled were all shown in the trailers. The writing was TERRIBLE. (I wasn't at all surprised when I checked the trivia section on IMDb and saw that much of it was improvised. There's a good reason that none of these people are on Saturday Night Live!) There were a lot of punchlines where I not only cringed, but I couldn't imagine ANYBODY even cracking a smile. Also, there's only so many times you can make a joke out of the fact that South Harmon Institute of Technology can be abbreviated SH IT, and I think that joke, which really wasn't all that clever to begin with, wore out its welcome within the first 20 minutes or so. Yet, it went on, and on, through the whole movie...The whole premise that real colleges are only meant to help one find a good job really got old as well. I guess that whole theme was intended to create an ""us vs. them"" idea, where the People(TM) triumph over the snobbish east coast intellectuals and old money. Personally, if anything, this movie made me WANT to be a snob rather than a slob.On top of its total inability to bring it with the funnies, it was incredibly unoriginal. The entire plot seemed to have been lifted from Camp Nowhere, Animal House, Van Wilder, and Old School. However, on top of that, the entire movie was EXTREMELY predictable. Tell me, please, just HOW you didn't see every major plot twist (of which there were few) from a mile away? Additionally, not only was it very implausible, but it seems that everybody in the movie was just plain STUPID. The president of the fraternity, who's dating Monica, treats Bartleby like a guest, and he's a douche to him in return? The students' parents, who seem to live about two towns over, at most, just accept that there's suddenly this new college that nobody's ever heard of? The Ohio State Board of Accreditation actually AGREES to let the students continue to do absolutely nothing, and receive college credit for it? Nobody in the surrounding area sees the new ""college"" being faked and says or does anything about it? Every single event that moved the plot just seemed incredibly cheesy and contrived, ESPECIALLY the ending. Also, the parents of over 300 people who got rejected from other schools actually pay $10 000 in cash UPFRONT?? Do YOU have that kind of money? Oh, and does Ohio not have junior colleges, or what??? The acting was horrible as well. Justin Long isn't NEARLY a good enough actor, or even charismatic enough, to play a leading role, especially when he's expected to carry writing that's as bad as this. Van Wilder at least had Jason Lee, Kal Penn, and Tara Reid, all of whom have, at least, charisma. (And Tara Reid is gorgeous.) Fortunately for him, the rest of the cast was even worse. His dad had, it seemed, about two expressions. Lewis Black was the only inspired casting choice, and I'm sure he's looking back, thinking ""Why, oh why, would I lower myself to this??"" I'm not the type of movie watcher who is put off by pedestrian acting, usually, but this was WELL below average.I don't even know why this movie was made. I believe this movie was actually made and released to 1. make money (HEY!! Let's make a really shoddy college comedy and just advertise a lot!! It's bound to be a hit!!! People are stupid!!) and 2. sell Macintosh computers. Seriously, did anyone else notice that they made sure to put the Mac symbol in virtually every other scene?? Every time I looked there was another iMac. Product placement is one thing, but this was just ridiculous. I half expected to see an iMac in front of Rory when she was meditating, or at the concert/party in the background, on the stage somewhere. Did Steve Jobs personally bankroll this movie, or write the script or something? No really, I want to know.It's unfortunate, because I had high hopes, and I went into this movie wanting desperately to enjoy it. In summary, if the CIA finds that it needs a new method of torture that is not banned by the Geneva Convention, I would recommend forcing Taliban enemy combatants to watch this movie with their eyes clamped open, Clockwork Orange-style. That'll crack 'em a lot faster than flushing a Qu'ran down the toilet.3/10***SPOILER BELOW***I WILL admit, however, that the telekinetic kid blowing up the dean's car at the end of the movie was amusing. :)",Accepted
186,maegers,who needs a good story when you're having fun,10,18 August 2006,"I think the problem with most people is that they take things seriously that weren't supposed to be taken seriously. If you go into Accepted expecting Oscar gold, you are going to be disappointed, but if you go into the movie expecting nothing, except maybe a few laughs, then you will leave happy! I enjoyed watching this movie a lot. I loved all the one liners, and the sarcasm. Plus, the names of some of the classes are GREAT! The story line is pretty basic, the tragic hero, something good happens, someone bad tries to wreck it, there's a girl, hazing, a courtroom, and then... battle royale! There are a few slow points in the film, and Bartleby's parents and sister are a little underdeveloped as characters, at least the sister has a little something going for her. For the most part, this was one of the better movies to hit mainstream theaters this summer. Go see it, have a laugh.",Accepted

After that i HAD to see that movie and i watched it with a couple of my friends...and WOW amazing. One of the best films of the year. THe entire movie i was laughing like crazy! The plot in this story is that Bartleby (Justin Long) doesn't get accepted into any of the schools he applied, so he makes another fake college for him and his friends so that he can fool his parents that he DID make it into college. So he makes the finishing touches and he fools his parents...until, more students look at the website and see the clicker (ACCEPTANCE IS ONE CLICK AWAY) and all these rejects come to this school.

Props to Bartlebee, as he does get to bang on the hot chick in the end. It has the most outlandish storyline in which the degenerates of harmon start a whole new institution know as South Harmon Institute of Technology. the drunk dean in the movie is also pretty hysterical, as he preaches some funny theories on life.

190,andrewz118822,awful movie,2,3 September 2006,"this movie was downright awful. most of the comedic scenes seem stale and trite, and possibly the funniest scene in the movie had already been given away in previews. the entire premise of the movie is so unbelievable and ridiculous its hard to really get into it. the actors themselves portray the most unrealistic characters. its not just the fact that the movies so hard to swallow, but its how they keep forcing it down your throat expecting you to dumb down and accept it. the plot itself is so shallow and easy to predict. boy somehow gets rejected from every school he applied to(i suppose he completely forgot about attending community college) and decides to create his own school for fellow rejects. all goes well for awhile until the validity of his school comes into question. all the while the dorky character manages to woo his beautiful neighbor into falling for him with his witty sarcasm, which apparently is a skill only he possesses. then comes the final struggle with the students somehow all bonding together and fighting for the survival of the school. of course the main character then persuades the state board of education to allow his school to stay alive with some ""inspirational"" speech. this movie would have been more fun to watch if i was under the age of 16 and still ignorant of all college matters and issues.",Accepted

193,promoace,Based on an old SNL skit?,3,6 July 2006,"Saturday Night Live did a skit on this very idea many years ago when Billy Crystal was a staff member. Accepted clearly draws upon the SNL skit for its premise (though not mentioned anywhere) and other ideas, as well as other ""teen"" movies. There are some funny parts in Accepted, but it does not hang together well at all. Animal House, the king of all college movies, had a cast of interesting characters that were developed through dialog and non-joke scenes. Accepted forgets all that and just goes for the simple and easy laugh. A little more character development would make the jokes funnier and the entire movie more interesting. The acting is fine, but the directing is a little loose and the timing is not sharp. By not having a developed plot or developed characters, the movie fails to consistently entertain. It's worth catching on video when your first five choices are checked out, but definitely not worth full price.",Accepted
194,theelward,I agree. Where's the love for school?,8,2 September 2006,"Having been in college for about 5 years now, I can relate. I am one of those students who despises the modern American academic system because it encourages people to work the system rather than pursue their interests. I realize that plenty of people earn their grades, but that does not change the fact that the system is still flawed. For whatever reason, I aced an English paper with what I felt was BS yet I later failed a different course, digital logic, while knowing what I was doing.What drew me to the movie was the premise. Similarly to the characters, I see education differently than those in charge. Instead of choosing one structure or another, why not make a personal effort? I was hoping the movie would feature video game class as designing video games is my dream, but I see their point. If we want to make model airplanes for a living, why should we not study it? Unlike a typical college where there are plenty of 'crap, I need to take this despite not liking it and probably not needing it after I graduate' classes, why not let people specialize? If college's point is to prepare people for jobs, it needs work. Some will argue that by working the system and achieving high grades, the achievers will get internships, but what about everyone else? It is quite possible to be ill-suited for formal education and yet succeed. Skills, such as negotiation, and attitudes are not often taught. Modern education emphasizes the abstract and hinders the practical which brings me to my next point.Lewis Black inspired me to want to see this movie and Lewis Black is why I'll probably remember the movie. It isn't just seeing him perform, it is as others say: Because he can explain facts of life so bluntly, he is an inspiration.For those seeking a college satire, this is a worthwhile movie. I wasn't blown away, but I left with a feeling that my anguish has been acknowledged.I give it an EIGHT of ten overall.-EE",Accepted

I'm not sure he's ready to be the main star of a movie. The idea of the movie was appealing, but the execution was predictable and awkward. The plot line was a little choppy and jumpy at times. Long's character has a little sister in the film, but for what reason, I really can't tell. She doesn't further the plot or really create any tension at any point in the movie. The comedy often falls flat. I didn't hear too many gut busting laughs in the theater, for good reason. The two highlights of the film are B's best friend Sherman and Lewis Black as the dean.

The movie champions innovative thought, not alcohol and rock and roll (No matter how prevalent throughout the movie). On a superficial level, ""Accepted"" is a movie about a few teenagers looking to slack off and have fun. However, the underlying premise of the movie is to force you to consider your own college education and why you enrolled in certain classes. If you ever had a discussion with a collegiate counselor who advised you not to take a certain course because if did not fit in with your major, you will have a better understanding of what ""Accepted"" is truly about. The best non-humorous quote comes from Monica. She states (more or less), ""I wanted to take photography, but my counselor advised me against it. She said that there are some photography courses that are only for journalism majors."" Oh, and Dean Lewis' comment, ""Our educational system views itself as a serveus. Serve-Us!

And although Accepted follows this formula very closely, it did deliver in other areas. The idea of creating a fake college was refreshing, and the way the Protagonist went about it, although very unrealistic, was entertaining. I also found the humor to be rather fresh and well set up. The only downside to the humor was the over-use of the contrived university's acronym (the school is called South Harmon Institute of Technology... you can figure out the rest). But regardless of the shortcomings of this movie, I found myself laughing out loud from start to finish. The physical humor was minor, yet well placed.

A lot of clever concepts and really great casting choices for these kids. For once a movie of this genre didn't go into overkill with the gross-out jokes. There was a subtext of truth to the premise which helped carry the more absurd plot points to acceptability.

Bartleby Gaines (also known as ""B"") is a high school senior who has talked his way through every problem in his life because he is a slacker, when it comes time to graduate, many of his friends are applying to multiple colleges, and most are being accepted, Bartleby also applies for many colleges, but just cant seem to get in due to his just passing by grades and extra curricular activities, he eventually realizes that he is not going to be accepted into any colleges, so he tries to convince to his family that skipping college would be the most financially effective thing to do; of course his family is very disappointed in him, so he decides to make his own college to please his parents, and as time goes on things become more and more complicated because his friends want to go into this also, and they will need a building for their fake college. On day while playing video games in the recently remodeled building, hundreds of students come to the lobby claiming that they have indeed been accepted into the college. Bartleby then is going to go tell the ""students"" that they actually have not been accepted into the college, but he is quilted into telling them what a great time they will have because no one else was accepted into another college, just like he wasn't, so he proceeds to attempt to create a new type of college where the students are also the teachers. But then a law student's girlfriend is found cheating with Bartleby and Ambrose is trying to do anything he can to shut down the college and hopefully get his girlfriend back. Bartleby is caught and the police come and shut down the fake college, but then his friend who has helped them all along, then turned on it has applied for accreditation of the college, and he is granted a temporary experimental license on the new form of a college.The tag lines for this movie are ""reject rejection"" and ""When every college turned them down. . . they made one up."" The hook of the film is Bartleby taking pictures for a fake id so the students and his friends can drink alcohol, then the principal walks into the room and he talks his way out of it makes it look as if he is trying to make a Glee club for the school before he leaves. The pivotal character is Bartleby because he is the one who we feel bad for because his parents are very strict and needs to go to college, he is also the one who is the main guy in the whole thing of making the college look legit and managing it all. The catalyst is Ambrose who is the one who is constantly trying to cause Bartleby more trouble, and is also the one who is being cheated on with Bartleby, so he is the one who reports S.H.I.T. (South Harmon Institute of Technology) as a fake college. When Schrader meets Ambrose he falls back against the pool sticks and everything falls down, in a later shot everything is back into place (nobody put it back).There are many continuity errors in this film. In a scene where Bartleby is being asked to mow a girl he likes lawn, the shots are constantly changing, and so is her hair placement, one shot its all behind her, and the next it will be in front of her shoulders. When bartleby's dad comes to congratulate him on being accepted into his fake college, he is mowing the lawn, and when the shot changes, his sweat spots on his shirt are different. When the group goes to check out the new building for the college, Bartleby tries to put a piece of the ceiling back on and a dead body falls through the ceiling, and Schrader is heard screaming before his mouth is open. When Schrader is painting and mopping, there is many buckets of paint and dirty water, and in between shots on of the buckets changes colors. The dialogue in this film is very clever and humorous, and would be exactly like what each peoples personality is like and something they would say. Ambrose being assigned earlier on in the film to buy out the surrounding properties for a new entrance for his school is a foreshadow to why Ambrose would want to buy, or in this case close the college down so it can be torn down for the better entrance. Another foreshadow is a guy who wants to learn to blow things up with his mind, is then in the end of the film blowing up the colleges arch enemy's, the principal of the mother school of the fake college, car before he gets into it. The music is great, because the sounds get you into the mood of each part of the movie, whether they are having a great time, panicking because of the possibility of getting caught, or inspirational.My personal opinion on the movie overall is that it was a very funny movie, with great ideas and clever dialogue, and it was very entertaining to watch. It inspires you to do better in school so you can go to a good college without all the worry like Bartleby is going through. The only things I didn't like about the film was the continuity error's, how much you can see the camera crew, and some of the synchronization isn't so great when it comes to the voices (mainly Schrader) I really enjoyed this film and its one I could enjoy watching many times over again. I would rate this film as 9 out of ten.",Accepted
215,bostnteabagparty01,If this is comedy it must be the crumbs.,3,21 December 2006,"For the past few weeks I heard so much about Accepted from my friends, so I decided to check it out. This easily predictable movie had the weakest cast ever aside from Lewis Black, the ""funniest"" scene in the movie was given away by commercials, probably why this movie did so well was because of the 30 times I would see them throughout the day on all of the hip TV channels to get teens to watch it. I give it a 3 because of the remotely humorous parts, and the times where Lewis Black would talk, I only recommend this movie to people who are easily, EASILY amused with simple repetitive jokes used in every other movie that runs along the same lines as this one.",Accepted
216,wildrice256,Don't expect much from this one...,2,12 January 2007,"I didn't know too much of this film before I rented it, and really wasn't expecting much from it to begin with. The acting was sub-par, especially from the actors who portrayed the main character's parents. The relationships between the characters were very unconvincing and the plot was very predictable. Most college stereotypes appeared in this film in an unrealistic, overly exaggerated way. The main highlights of the film like many have mentioned before are the scenes that comic Lewis Black appear in, which sadly is only about a total of 5 minutes in this entire film. This is probably only one of a few ""comedies"" that I rarely laughed at. The film tries desperately to entice the viewers attention with sexuality and fails miserably as the ""eye candy"" are armed with horrible one-liners. I pretty much was getting ready to give up during the first half of the film, but I thought I would give it a chance and finish it. Sadly, this film fell short at impressing me, as I am not a sucker for random one-liners, toilet humor, and weak plots.If you are looking for a film similar to this, I would recommend 'Van Wilder' over this film, purely on the fact that 'Van Wilder' actually made me laugh while watching it.",Accepted

The film took a while to pick up from the start, at least for me seeing as I expected this was a run-along America Pie flick. But it was slightly different-- a fun-loving slacker who finishes high school and makes his OWN college, running it accordingly. As you can expect, there's a lot of parties and hot girls in bikinis but this film tried harder than your average teen flick. Bartleby Gaines (Justin Long) encourages his students / peers to learn through freedom of expression and ultimately 'shove it to the system.' The humour was varied which I loved. All the cast delivered fantastic performances-- hire this one out with a friend, it's a bloody crack up!",Accepted
221,lechristoe,Too Smart for Teens/Too Raw for Adults,9,28 August 2007,"Accepted is not a movie for everyone.WARNING: Most of the humor in this movie is subtle. You will not get slapped across the face with penis jokes galore. There are a few perverted quips here and there to please the American Pie Crowd but that sort of teenage humor (which is fine as well) is NOT the nuts and bolts of this more cerebral young adult comedy.I'm not going to spoil the jokes for you but the way young Bartleby (Justin Long) thrashes the fraternity boys with his rapier wit is 1,000 times as refreshing and laughter inducing than a poorly written fornication comedy would have been.The genius of this movie is how subtle, tongue-in cheek comedy is woven into a broader picture of profound thematic messages. If there is one thing I notice about the postings about this movie is that basically everyone, even the negative posters feel moved enough to comment on the thematic components. There is a VERY inspiring and brave message about being an individual, thinking for oneself, and facing rejection unflinchingly that this movie does a brilliant job promoting.Are you looking for something just as funny as the best teen movie but more intelligent? If so, you MUST watch Accepted. If thematic components, profound messages, and subtle comedy don't appeal to you, avoid it at all costs.",Accepted
222,dandodson,"Animal House meets Ferris Buehler, Risky Business and Old School",6,25 May 2006,"""Accepted"" has more than its fair share of comic moments and characters. That's the fortunate thing about making a movie about goofy people. Unfortunately, it takes its self too seriously and continuously hits us over the head with the ""Losers are OK too"" message.""Animal House"" from which ""Accepted"" borrowed freely, was a more straightforward comedy. It strung together a series of great sketches with a lame plot line, but the plot was never the movie. Animal House will forever be the college comedy to which other similar films are compared.Risky Business was more purposeful, Ferris Buehler tighter and Old School better acted.So where does this leave ""Accepted""? In need of re-work.Fortunately I saw it at a screening in May and it's not supposed to come out until August, leaving the film-makers time to re-work. There's good material here and the audience laughed at the gags. Also, the premise of a made up college is interesting. I just hope that they lose the preachiness and overt plagiarism from ""Animal House"".",Accepted

224,paramasutra,I liked it,8,30 November 2009,"First of all, there are alien movies out there with a more plausible plot. That is obvious and evident so the reviews listing reasons why the plot is impossible are a little redundant. The point of the plot was not to show a plausible scenario but to criticize the current college system, show an ""ideal world"" but mostly to have some laughs in the process.Nevertheless, special effects award should go to this movie as for a second or two you get to the point of believing in the plot! This means that the criticism is actually getting sold out correctly even hidden inside all the shallow comedy.The comedy part itself was OK. It did have its funny moments. Though if laughter is what you want, there are alternatives that are much better.Lewis was very funny and crazy. Lively was really likable in this movie. Starting as the popular blonde everybody desires but then turning into a girl with a passion of her own. There are also interesting/funny minor characters like A.D.D that will spice it up. B is supposed to be the stone of the whole movie but somehow by the end of the movie it loses some of his inspiration skills. The other main characters were not very memorable.The strength of the movie is really in the merge of all its aspects. A crazy plot that you want to buy. Some fun things. But most importantly, it is not completely over the top. For a teen movie, it is nice that it won't fall into banal humor or fart jokes or over use breasts. It will have its share of dumb humor and chicks but won't exaggerate. Overall it is a nice movie. The message is good but don't take it too seriously.",Accepted

My girlfriend and I laughed through the whole movie and recommend it to anyone looking for light-hearted fun. It isn't a believable story, but don't be critical.This summer has been pretty good for movies, and you can add this one to the list. Clerks II was funnier, but this has a good, funny story.

I loved the story, which had good flow; it managed to get in all the funny bits without getting too far off track and the serious drama bits without getting too heavy. I know this is kind of a gushy comment, but I can't think of any complaints to make about this movie.

230,xphiler06,"Far from perfect, but nowhere near ruins",7,11 August 2006,"Accepted is not the year's funniest movie, but neither is it the worst. The film's premise alone demands that the viewer suspend disbelief--of almost everything. Almost nothing about the movie is believable. But, for the most part, the jokes are good. And what the movie lacks on the page is made up for in the casting.Justin Long gives an excellent performance as Bartleby Gaines, a guy who has just graduated from high school but has been rejected from every college he has applied to. In desperation, he and a few friends create a fictional college (South Harmon Instutute of Technology) in order to get the approval of their parents. Although the movie revolves around Bartleby, there is little in the script to give Bartleby much character. Justin Long, however, brings the character to life and makes him feel incredibly real. It is about time Justin Long had the lead in a big comedy, and I can only root for more.Jonah Hill, who plays Bartleby's best friend, Sherman, also turns in a surprisingly solid performance in the side-kick role. His delivery of lines alone is what makes most of them funny. Their friendship is actually more interesting than the romantic relationship; it is, in fact, the most interesting and well-played aspect of the movie. Lewis Black in the film is Lewis Black (he's called Dean Lewis in the film). Watching him felt like watching a segment of ""Back in Black"" on The Daily Show. Perhaps it is my fondness for Lewis Black, but it didn't bother me and Black's scenes were general highlights of the movie. Adam Herschman (Glen) and Columbus Short (Hands) are given relatively little to do, but are also enjoyable in their roles.",Accepted
231,raseekrocks,"Can't speak for adults, but teens (or anyone who enjoys teen movies) should definitely enjoy it!",10,25 November 2013,"I am writing this review mainly because everything, the reviews (a meager 37% on RottenTomatoes, seriously?), the box-office, etc., seem to be against this film, and I feel that this film doesn't deserve any of these ""negativity""s. Maybe because I watched this film without any expectation (which seems to be the case with most people who've reviewed this film in IMDb) or because I am a teenager and can relate to it, I really enjoyed this film. I'm a fan of the comedy genre in general, especially of the ""feel good"" or ""energetic comedy"" sub-genre-- the ones in which films make you laugh as well as feel good and at the same time inspire you. I know a lot of people railing against this film complain about the general implausibility of the plot, and I do admit that they are right, but seriously, I have never understood why people always want films to have realistic plots. Come on, Lord Of The Rings, Star Wars, Forrest Gump, do any of these have ""realistic"" plots? Of course not! Yet they are fantastic, really enjoyable! And this film is somewhere along the similar lines. Maybe some of you will feel indignant for my comparing this film to LOTR and Star Wars and Forrest Gump and all, but that's just your cynicism talking! I really enjoyed this movie, and I believe anyone with an open mind and not-so-general-air of cynicism toward teen movies will enjoy it as well. But of course, since I'm a teenager, I can't tell how adults are going to take this film, so I speak only for teens and/or people who enjoy teen movies.PS: This is my first IMDb review.

This is what movies should aspire to. Funny without being totally stupid, a little sexy without having every female in the cast show her boobs, biting without resorting to the 'f-word' every line. The movie reminded me of the classic movie ""Animal House"", the college setting, the fraternity, lots of gags, and pretty young women. With two of the best up & coming actors out there right now Justin Long and Lewis Black its a good hit. Long is from ""Ed"" and the new Apple computer ads. He was just coming into his own as an actor in ""Ed,"" and he was excellent here. He's a natural in front of the camera. Give Black an idea and let him improvise. Whether his rants and lines here are scripted or improvised are no matter. He's priceless delivering his thoughts on middle class angst. One thing about Black's delivery, his hand gestures are not those of a comedian. It just seems like he's having a conversation with you, and I think that makes him unconsciously more effective. The ending was a little unrealistic, but it is only a movie. The movie was made for the young crowd to have a little fun. All around a good movie.",Accepted

Some of the lines were truly corny, but it was laughable and enjoyable. so what if there's no way a few friends could fix up an abandoned building in a short time period? So what if there are enough stereotypes to fill an entire issue of MAD magazine? It doesn't matter to me, or most likely anyone who liked it.it's called willing suspension of disbelief, simply called 'Going along with something and taking it at face value without looking at the impossibilities.' SUMMARY: Bartleby 'B' Gaines gets rejected from every college he applies to, so he decides to create his own, with the help of his friends.the discover an abandoned mental asylum and turn it into the SOUTH HARMON INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY, and they even have a fake dean( Played very well by Martin Black). Unfortunately, B's friend Schroeder puts a feature on the fake website that ""Accepts"" people, giving an address where the college is. Just when B and company think they are home free, hundreds of college hopefuls who were rejected as well show up at their doorstep. Everything gets out of hand, as people start to go crazy on the imaginary campus. The neighboring real college wants to demolish the building to build a big addition, an entrance field ("" to keep out the riffraff""). However, Bartleby resists the request to demolish the fake college and is subsequently duped by the real college dean's lackey, a fraternity leader, and launches a plan to destroy the fake college, and then is discovered by the state education board, where a hearing is scheduled to terminate the fake college.~~~ Personally,i would not rate this against Animal House, as the quintessential college movie, because of the that they ARE NOT THE SAME!

He also features in the Macintosh computer commercials as the MAC. 'ACCEPTED' is a fairly original idea to begin with and quite funny, but as the movie goes on it starts to fall back on some pretty tried and tested ideas. Although it has a different spin it was I think basically a remake of the classic 'ANIMAL HOUSE' even down to some of the characters being fairly close mirrors of the originals i.e. Sherman Schrader - Flounder and Glen -'Bluto' Some of the scenes involving Sherman and his trying to get accepted by his snobby fraternity are very close to 'Animal House' having said this if you loved 'Animal House' (and I did) you will thoroughly enjoy this.",Accepted
