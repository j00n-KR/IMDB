0,MartinHafer,If only they'd eliminated the story...it would have been so much better.,3,29 December 2019,"""Detective Pikachu"" is a bad film that gives most Pokemon fans what they want--to finally see CGI Pokemon characters interacting in the real world. It's a shame they spent so much money on the CGI but only about $5 on writing....as this could have been a very enjoyable film but wasn't.A bland young man is upset because he learned that his detective father has died. So he heads to the town where father lived and soon meets up with his father's old partner...a Pikachu that can talk and the bland guy, for some reason, can understand him and vice-versa. They soon meet up with an obnoxious stereotype of a female reporter and they investigate both the father's supposed death and the recent disappearance of a Mewtwo. And, the trail eventually leads to a nasty disabled guy who is a liar and a jerk.This is a very, very frustrating film for fans...as I am a fan of the game. I have played many of the Pokemon games over the years and LOVED seeing the Pokemon characters brought to life. But the story and acting were terrible. The story was a paranoid mess that kids won't be able to understand and adults would find a bit bland. And the two main characters had very little in the way of personality or presence. Bland....very, very bland. Overall a mixed bag and I suggest you watch it with your remote nearby. See the Pokemon and just speed past the silly plot and acting.Sadly, the biggest casualty in the film was fun. How could a Pokemon live-action/CGI film be THIS un-fun?!",Pokémon Detective Pikachu
1,Leofwine_draca,For very small children,3,11 April 2020,"DETECTIVE PIKACHU is the perhaps inevitable film version of the Pokemon Go mobile game, and it's almost entirely without merit. It's set in our world with the exception that Pokemon monsters roam around in generally friendly ways. The non-story sees a walking wooden plank, Justice Smith (who was also awful in JURASSIC WORLD: FALLEN KINGDOM) teaming up with a snarky Pikachu in order to solve a very mild, almost non-existent mystery. Ryan Reynolds voices Pikachu, of all people, and brings some of his trademark sarcasm to the role, but he's really not good here. And wait until you see the cliched-as-they-come villain. The film has been made as expression of indifferent CGI effects and silly humour, and the end result is something that won't appeal to anyone over 5.",Pokémon Detective Pikachu
2,SnoopyStyle,good not great,7,3 July 2019,"Pokémon has been part of human society since the beginning. In Ryme City, Pokémon are partners to the human population rather than simply used in battles. News arrive to Tim Goodman (Justice Smith) that his father has come to a tragic end. He goes to Ryme City to search for his missing father. He encounters Detective Pikachu (Ryan Reynolds), his father's Pokémon. He's the only human who could understand Pikachu. Lucy Stevens (Kathryn Newton) is an eager journalist intern who is desperate the break the case. The group investigates and finds a secret conspiracy.Director Rob Letterman has made several good but not great animated and children-adjacent movies. This is another one. There are bits of fun from Reynolds. Justice Smith is a bit stiff although his character starts off as stiff. Kathryn Newton needs to be more than a pretty face. It seems like a character ready for a comedic actress. The Pokémon are fun. I am not a fan. I don't know much about them. They seem cute. This has moments of fun. The plot needs more exposition when the big twist is revealed. It feels a bit rushed as the movie is eager to get into some action thrills. Like I said before, this is good, not great.",Pokémon Detective Pikachu
3,Prismark10,Still gotta catch up,5,22 August 2019,"Pikachu with a deerstalker and voiced by Ryan Reynolds. That is the gimmick of Pokémon Detective Pikachu.Pokémon and humans coexist in Ryme city in a plot that owes a debt to Who Framed Roger Rabbit.Tim Goodman (Justice Smith) goes to Ryme City looking for his father, an ace detective thought to be dead. Tim encounters his father's Pokémon, Pikachu who Tim can understand but Pikachu's memories are hazy.Both team up to find out what happened to Tim's father and why Pikachu's memories are missing as they encounter a conspiracy.The film actually looks rather good, although it is weird to see Ryme City with parts of London's unique skyscrapers. Pokémon fans will enjoy the film, kids will like it. Non fans might find the film engaging courtesy of Reynolds but it is a strange concept with a lukewarm plot and predictable twists.",Pokémon Detective Pikachu
4,nogodnomasters,I can feel it in my jellies,10,8 August 2019,"Tim Goodman (Justice Smith) travels to Ryme City following the death of his estranged father who died in a fiery car crash after am explosion at the Pokemon DNA research facility. While going through his father's belongings he opens up a purple gas and the next thing you know he can understand his father's Pikachu who has the voice and wit of Deadpool minus the vulgarity. Along the way, he meets a news station intern (Kathryn Newton) because all the great films are love stories. Something odd is going on, so our threesome investigate and BTW Tim can understand what the Pikachu is saying.This was a fun film. It brings to life the fun characters. It was also sci-fi fantasy in addition to the comedy action adventure as classified. Good family night entertainment.",Pokémon Detective Pikachu
5,kosmasp,Pika Pika,7,8 July 2019,"I'm guessing that will mean more to hardcore fans than myself, but even though I never really got into the whole Pokemon world, I did rather enjoy this movie. I only played the Pokemon Go thing once (kinda fun I guess, but not really my thing). But Ryan Reynolds really brings quite the fun to the movie - fun for all ages by the way.And while I knew one major plot point (revealed towards the end of the movie), I still was able to enjoy the fun ride this was. Don't expect too much and just sit back, relax and take it in. I'm guessing as Pokemon fan some will be more delighted than others, but as I said you don't have to be to be entertained.",Pokémon Detective Pikachu
6,paul_haakonsen,Surprisingly entertaining...,6,3 March 2020,"Right, well I was not of the right age to be watching the Pokémon animated series back in the day, so I never really got up to speed with it. Sure, I know what the essence of Pokémon is, but that is about it.I sat down to watch this 2019 movie on Netflix, not really sure what to think of it as it was a Pokémon movie. My wife started watching it, and I saw the CGI, and I was impressed, so I joined in on the movie.Now, I must say wow. This movie was spectacular to look at visually, and the story was actually interesting and enjoyable enough. Sure, it was a bit out there, but then again it is a Pokémon themed movie, so go figure.I could name maybe 3 or 4 of the Pokémons seen in the movie, that is about as extensive as my knowledge of the creatures was. But without prior knowledge of the universe, the movie was still rather enjoyable.As for the CGI - color me impressed. They really went all the way here, and the attention to detail was just phenomenal, and it all looked so very realistic. That definitely was the selling point for me, and why I sat down to watch the movie.While Pokémon might be aimed at a younger audience, I will say that this movie actually is well-worth watching even as an adult (without any interest in the Pokémon phenomena).I am rating ""Pokémon Detective Pikachu"" a very well-deserved six out of ten stars.",Pokémon Detective Pikachu
7,studioAT,A nice surprise,5,30 September 2019,"I watched this with a sense of trepidation. Although I liked Pokémon as a kid I didn't quite know how they'd translate into a live action film.The answer is quite well. This is probably because there's a decent story being told with the human cast, as well as the creatures.Yes, it's darker than some family films, but there is a lot to like for new Pokémon fans and newbies alike.",Pokémon Detective Pikachu
8,view_and_review,Ryan Reynolds Couldn't Save This One,5,7 February 2020,"Yeah it was that bad. OK, let me not get carried away. I don't want to bury the movie. I'll say it wasn't for me. Once you get past the big budget CGI and visual effects there wasn't much there. I suppose it's a great tribute and recognition of Pokeman fans, of which I am not one. Or maybe they made this movie to keep Pokeman chasers from running into traffic or from going into bad neighborhoods to see a Pokeman on their app. I don't know.""Pokeman Detective Pikachu"" was about a teenage boy who lost his mother at age eleven and was estranged from his father. So, unlike everyone else, he grew up in this Pokeman world with no Pokeman attachment. When his father is killed he finds a Pikachu that he understands and the two of them begin looking for his father who may not be dead.It was a weak premise for me, I was just hoping Ryan Reynolds could save it. Given the script, he did what he could. He couldn't save it, but I guess he prevented it from being a total failure.",Pokémon Detective Pikachu
9,bombersflyup,Bad.,1,11 June 2019,"Pokemon Detective Pikachu is extremely disappointing, simply walking around catching Pokemon and battling would of been sufficient.The story's terrible and main actors are acting like children, but dress up and have grown up jobs and such. Ryan Reynolds doesn't fit the role of Pikachu, if that's a possible statement. Still the only decent character in the film though, with Psyduck. Credit to the people involved in Rita Ora's soundtrack music video though, certainly got me interested.",Pokémon Detective Pikachu
10,Mr-Fusion,What's this? A good video game adaptation!,7,23 May 2019,"When Pikachu opens his mouth, do you expect Ryan Reynolds' voice? Hell no! And while that was the point of the marketing campaign for ""Detective Pikachu"", a warm and engaging movie is the surprising result. Best of all, you don't have to know much about the source material -- it's a murder mystery with cute Japanese characters.With a twisty screenplay and an aesthetic that's equal parts ""Blade Runner"" and ""Who Framed Roger Rabbit"", the movie deposits you in the thick of a who-dunnit, and you don't really have time to care about all the Pokémon goings-on. I certainly didn't walk into this movie as an expert (haven't touched the fandom in twenty years), but still managed to find plenty within to entertain. Reynolds is his usual self without going overboard, and the story is involving from the beginning; at times even touching. I liked these characters, I liked the environment and I'd do it all again.",Pokémon Detective Pikachu
11,FeastMode,lame,3,15 October 2019,"Lame. scarcely funny. cheesy. lots of cliches and predictable moments. and worst of all, they made the STRANGEST decisions on the premise and where they wanted to go with the story. no idea how this is the route they chose (1 viewing 10/14/19)",Pokémon Detective Pikachu
12,Robert_duder,"Fun and simple, it works",7,31 May 2019,"I missed the Pokemon craze by a few years being too old for it but I'm familiar enough with it to know it's fan base. This was a risky movie no matter what they did but I really wanted to see what they would do to bring this world to life. Most die hard fans seem to approve of what they've done. Adding Ryan Reynolds as Pikachu's voice was an odd move and almost forced to me. I mean why not put Deadpool's insanely successful voice inside of Pikachu to get the fans to come in. But in the context of the movie, it actually works better than I would have thought. I still feel like it was an odd move but Reynolds is charismatic enough to pull it off. Justice Smith is very good leading the film, this should do great things for his career. He takes what could have been a very silly movie and actually gives it heart and seriousness and he and Reynolds (well Reynolds' voice) have great chemistry together. Kathryn Newton is also good but in a very typical sort of role for this type of movie. Seeing the Pokemon brought to life was very cool, I think director Rob Letterman who has done mostly animation did a great job of making you believe in this world where Pokemon and humans live together like pets and masters. The story tries a little too hard but it helps make the film feel more serious and that's not a bad thing. At times this film reminded me of those really cool ""puppet"" type movies of the 80's like Dark Crystal and Labrynth and that's a great accomplishment and a great compliment. It's fun, you'll enjoy it, it's clean enough for most kids and adults will enjoy it too. 7.5/10",Pokémon Detective Pikachu
13,ElMaruecan82,Just another juicy bone tossed at us...,4,26 May 2019,"Well, first of all, to the parents of young children (let's say younger than ten, not Peppa Pig level but capable to enjoy a good Disney film and grab a few mature elements of it) here's a sound advice: don't take them to this film, they'll be bored as hell. Not taking the case of my daughter like a generality but she kept asking me how much time was left and the next thing I did when I came back home was to show here the first episode of the original ""Pokemon"" cartoon series and I could see the glee in her eyes that was missing all through the film.Apparently, four screenwriters collaborated for the project but serioysly, any screenwriter who believes the premise of Pikachu wearing a cute detective hat and talking like ""Ted"" without the F-dombs was enough to earn kids' undivided patience should learn a few basic rules about the art of entertainment. You don't make a kids' film like some stupid doll with a new prop. Indeed, ""Detective Pikachu"" reminded me of that scene where Lisa Simpson tried to stop girl from buying the new Malibu Stacy because the product was still embodying awful stereotypes about gender relationships, but then Smithers pointed out that she had "" a new hat"" and that was all it took for the better Lisa Lionheart doll to be ignored.And I had serious reservations in the first place, I was afraid ""Aladdin"" would be too 'hardcore' and I already had a huge disappointment with ""Dumbo"" so I gave Pikachu a chance expecting a fine tribute to the universe of the Pokemon, with such a crazy premise it deserved a shot. The first scene didn't really enhance my expectations, Justice Smith who plays Tim struck me as the kind of dull actor who plays the younger version of the hero and then you get the real star after ten minutes, I wasn't sure I would enjoy his ""presence"" for more than an hour and half. I don't mean to be rude but he's got the kind of physical presences you expect for comedy roles and you know there's a problem when the moments that are supposed to be funny fall flat and the comments on the ""jokes"" don't make it better.So I expected the first ten minutes to make me care for the hero, I don't think it made me care for the story either... and it didn't get any better after. In fact, the film embodies all the worst clichés about action-comedy-pictures aimed for a younger audience: since they can't drop F-bombs, they think they should compensate with chase scenes, explosions, pseudo-suspenseful sequences where we've got to follow people walking for endless minutes before ""something"" happens, cute romantic innuendo and the most possibly prefabricated sad backstory applied to a main character in order to provide him three-dimensionality. Sure, Tim had ""depth"" but then how about casting an actor who doesn't have the same range of emotions than Psyduck?But who cares about Tim, Pikachu has got a new hat!That's how it works, Pikachu, one of the cutest and most lovable animated character of all-time, has his cuteness level pushed to eleven with his CGI look and his voice, so Iwonder what's the worse thing about that: that the producers thought such a cheaply-gimmicked film would be enough to drain a maximum of viewers or that the viewers proved them right! It doesn't take an expert to figure that the film tries to be ""Ted"" but it takes a more mature mindset to realize it should have been a worthy successor of Robert Zemeckis' classic ""Who Framed Roger Rabbit"", it should have cared about having a better lead character because no matter how memorable Pikachu is (and the premise got rapidly tiresome), the film needed a solid duo like in the two aforementioned films. It takes two to make a buddy movie.And so the film supposedly pays tribute to the Pokemon universe in all urbane greyness and a lifeless nature where you wouldn't even expect to find a squirrel, let alone a Pokemon. The whole look of the film is bleak and depressing Xerox copy of Gotham City. How about making other Pokemons talk? How about trying to do justice to the legacy of the franchise instead of some CGI-blockbuster ersatz? How about making something that kids would enjoy, since it couldn't be ""Deadpool""? I think this is a fine candidate for the Razzies and at least ""Street Fighter"" tried something with the lucidity of a writing aware of its limitations... and its villain was bad-ass! The villain is virtually non-existent here.Obviously, the super team of writers was so obsessed by the structural elements of the story: hero/ quest/ pivotal moments/ twist and redemption, as if the investigation was too important to let some recreation of the Pokemonverse interfere with it, so instead of a predictable but enjoyable live-action version of the original story, what we get is a novelty on the paper but eventually a boring character investigating on an uninteresting case and with a fun sidekick.To end on another Simpsons' parallel (yes, the other yellow icons), the Pokemons are only some meat put around a bone, ""Deecive Pikachu"" is just a bone tossed at young viewers. And quoting Kent Brockman: ""that's supposed to make it all better"".",Pokémon Detective Pikachu
14,Edvis-1997,9,8,10 May 2019,It was amazing movie. Realy funny not interesting just for kids but for the whole family also. The ending was really unexpected.Waited for this movie for ages and it didn't disappoint me.Worth to watch.,Pokémon Detective Pikachu
15,Pjtaylor-96-138044,Pika Pika.,7,12 May 2019,"Despite not being a fan of - or, even, all that familiar with - Pokémon (I have a passing knowledge of it and I think I saw one episode of the TV series about ten years ago), I think that 'Pokémon Detective Pikachu (2019)' is an entertaining film. It's probably the best video-game adaptation to date - though, admittedly, that bar isn't set too high - and it's a fun time when it gets going. It's not perfect, though. You sort of get spoon-fed the central mystery and, even then, it plays out pretty much exactly how you expect it to, despite a bit of initially somewhat subversive characterisation. There are a number of twists and turns to the plot but they're all predictable and, to be honest, fairly cliché. Still, they're executed rather well. Indeed, the same can be said for the rest of the narrative. The fact that you can see certain things coming is never an issue, really, as the movie moves at a decent pace. The central characters are well-rounded enough that they're not only empathetic but also quite likeable, delivering both the humour and the emotion needed to make a story like this work. It's never hilarious but it makes you smile more than you might expect and it has a good heart, to boot. The third act loses its way a little; it starts to stray into 'superhero finale' territory, if you know what I mean. The nuances of the plot peel away here for an over-the-top action-scene that seems slightly silly (yes, even in a movie with Ryan Reynolds voicing Pikachu). It's also less believable than the rest of the piece because, before this, the world feels suitably grounded; the visual-effects, while obviously visual-effects, are integrated into every scene almost seamlessly. They're diverse, organic, brimming with personality and fill almost every frame, bringing with them plenty of technical challenges - such as realistic (and reactionary) fur, complex camera-tracking and precise rotoscoping. It mightn't necessarily seem it, but it really is a feat in the field. Overall, the film is a well-executed, light-hearted and enjoyable experience, despite its few flaws. It wisely keeps its focus mainly on its characters, while also doing enough world-building to get everyone on board with its premise. It's not groundbreaking, but it's a more-than-solid effort that can be enjoyed by, essentially, everyone. Plus, if you're a die-hard Pokémon fan, I think this will be a real treat. 7/10",Pokémon Detective Pikachu
16,ThomasDrufke,Universe Building,7,11 May 2019,"For some people, the PG-13 humor in Once Upon a Deadpool didn't work, but I actually thought it hit pretty well, proving that Ryan Reynolds is far more versatile of a comedic actor than perhaps given credit for. Detective Pikachu is rated PG, and he still finds a way to entertain with irreverent and risque humor, as the titular character himself. In what is essentially a universal building spin-off to begin a new franchise, Detective Pikachu is great light hearted fun perhaps a little cliche and isn't the first new 'Pokemon universe' film people wanted, but it certainly proves there is something here cinematically that demands more entries.7.0/10",Pokémon Detective Pikachu
17,ericstevenson,The most critically acclaimed video game movie of all time!,8,3 June 2019,"After much anticipation, we've finally gotten a movie based on a video game with a fresh rating on RottenTomatoes. ""Pokemon"" is not only the most popular video game franchise ever made. It's the most popular franchise ever made! It makes sense they would work extra hard on it. It's based on the ""Detective Pikachu"" game and tells the story of a guy who finds he can talk to a Pikachu. They team up to investigate what happened to the guy's father and investigate this purple gas that makes pokemon aggressive.I am disappointed the characters from the anime didn't appear, especially Team Rocket! Then again, on this website, ""Pokemon: Lucario And The Mystery Of Mew"" still has a higher rating and I do believe that's the better one! I will admit that the villain's plan could have been better as it seemed to have little motivation. We still get great snark from none other than the guy who played Deadpool and Mr. Mime might be the best designed character here. The designs can be a bit unsettling but they still work pretty well. The twist is set up very well and it makes it seem like it won't happen, but it does what it should! ***",Pokémon Detective Pikachu

This movie made me laugh, smile & even feel a little sad in some bits. I've seen other reviews hating on it which is crazy cause it's just pure entertainment. Some have strange taste regardless I'm satisfied with this adaptation very much, the only thing I agree with is it definitely could've had more Pokémon!",Pokémon Detective Pikachu
21,John6Daniels,The villain and the twist was so obvious that Quicksilver saw it coming,9,9 September 2019,"1st off. Tim basically knows nothing about Pokemon.2nd off. It was so obvious who the villain was. They always show the villain early in the movie in the newsNow.I thought this movie would have been a disaster when I first heard this movie was in development 2 years ago.Surprisingly for a 2019 movie It was fun and adventurous.
You get to see many Pokemon, however its nothing like the game or anime. Pokemon in this movie are just pets and pests.The cast does a fine job. The lead guy Tim does a fine job after hearing he was horrible. In my perspective I have no complaints. Pikachu isn't obnoxious and lame like Deadpool from the subpar Deadpool movies.You got your villain who isn't nothing special out of the ordinary which is ok for a first take.I recommend this to people who enjoy a good adventure. You'll get one here in Detective Pikachu.",Pokémon Detective Pikachu
22,briancham1994,I didn't feel it in my jellies,6,21 June 2020,"This film has all the right ingredients - cute Pokémon, a cool setting, new characters and a weird mystery. This should all amount to a great success, but the story was somehow both convoluted and banal. The twists were predictable and messy. Still, I have to give it credit for the visual world building though. It's a creative departure from the usual Pokemon series.",Pokémon Detective Pikachu
23,cruise01,Amazing and a dream come true with bringing back a lot of nostalgic moments.,9,11 May 2019,"Pokemon Detective Pikachu (4.5 out of 5 stars).Pokemon Detective Pikachu is every fan kid dream bringing their nostalgic moment waking up on a Saturday morning to watch a Pokemon animated series or playing the game. This film pays a great respect to the material and tries not to disappoint the fans. The film is a lot of fun. The characters and actors are great. The film has plenty of action. The concept is pretty fun and cool. There is a brief Pokemon underground battle. A scene with a character trying to catch a pokemon with a pokeball. And Mewtwo making an awesome appearance.There has been plenty of animated Pokemon movies and series that keep these stories going. Detective Pikachu does take the story into a new ground. Being based on the video game itself. Tim (Justice Smith) trying to solve a case about his missing father after he has discovered something. A Pikachu (voiced by Ryan Reynolds) who is addicted to coffee, can talk to only Tim, and assists Tim in trying to solve this case. You have characters like Lucy (Kathryn Newton) who has a Psyduck that is her Pokemon. Who also wants to solve the mystery of Tim's father discovery. The film does have a story about Tim struggling with his father. They have never seen eye to eye. He has been distant with him. Tim and Pikachu's bonding together and trying to work together was a lot of fun. I did feel like the film could have been so much more with the plot. Besides being held together with a conspiracy on Tim's father disappearance and the discoveries he has made.Ryan Reynolds did steal the show being Pikachu. A Pikachu addicted to coffee and constantly nonstop talking. He made the character great. And lovable. Justice Smith was great too playing a young man who doesn't have a Pokemon and feels like he is missing something in his life.There is a lot of fun action. Pikachu trying to battle against a Charizard was fun. Tim, Lucy, and Pikachu investigating a lab and coming across a land changing moment was just great. The setting of Ryme City looked just beautiful. Looking a little futuristic with humans living amongst Pokemon was cool. The music score by Henry Jackman was great. Making the film feel like it came in the 90s. The visual effects were a bit questionable at times. But still fun and entertaining.Overall, Pokemon Detective Pikachu is a really good fantasy mystery film. The film has a lot of action and a brief battle taking place during a parade in Ryme City. Plenty of more chases and more fun characters. Ryan Reynolds did steal the show with his charismatic personality as Pikachu. This film does bring back a lot of good memories on seeing this back on the big screen.",Pokémon Detective Pikachu
24,Floated2,Enjoyable family movie,7,3 December 2020,"Having no prior knowledge to Pokémon and not knowing what exactly this movie was about, had no expectations. As it turned out, relatively enjoyed this film more than expected. The story is quite simple but the appeal is of course the visuals and designs of the Pokémon themselves. Ryan Reynolds voicing Pikachu works great as his dialogue is the highlight.Although the ending was somewhat weak as they threw in a few twists in the end. It looked as if it was set up fir a sequel but seeing as this film fight perform well enough at the box office, a sequel most likely won't happen.",Pokémon Detective Pikachu
25,eddie_baggins,One of the most straight up enjoyable video game movies of all time! A must-watch for fans both young and old,7,9 May 2019,"Colour me surprised, for against all the odds and pre-conceived perceptions, Pokémon Detective Pikachu is one of the straight up most enjoyable video game adaptations of all time and a sure-fire delight to long-time fans the world over.Not exactly competing against a raft of quality content when it comes to video games being bought to life on the big screen, Rob Letterman's film just gets it, it doesn't break any new ground or achieve much in a narrative sense but by creatively and vividly bringing the wonderful and imaginative universe of Pokémon into the real world (or made up world in the case of its Tokyo/London inspired Ryme City), Detective Pikachu is an absolute child-like delight for any fans of the series, both young and old.In some ways it feels like the films biggest weakness, outside of a fairly daft villain plot and some so-so storytelling around that, in the sense that you can't help but feel as though Detective Pikachu will leave those with very little Pokémon association quite cold with its many throwbacks, scenarios and even music stemming straight from the Pokémon games or famous TV shows, meaning this is first and foremost a film for fans, even if casual to non-following fans of the brand would enjoy the visual delights on display.Central to the film's success as an entertaining offering is Letterman and his team's heartfelt bringing to life of Pokémon's wild collection of crazy critters, led by the ever popular and seriously cute new imagining of everyone's favourite (rat?) Pokémon, the yellow fur ball that is Pikachu.Here voiced by Ryan Reynolds, in what ends up being an inspired choice of voice casting, with Reynolds bringing his wild energy and ad-libbing to the table with full force, Pikachu is the this films MVP (even if a particularly worried Psyduck and an intense Mr. Mime come close to stealing the spotlight).Teaming up with Justice Smith's blue collar insurance worker Tim Goodman to help solve the mystery of his missing father, Pikachu is a great CGI creation that faithfully and energetically brings the well-known pop culture figure to life and whenever Pikachu is sharing the screen time or front and centre to proceedings, Detective Pikachu is a breezy, fun and often exciting ride that overcomes its plot weaknesses with relative ease.Detective Pikachu also offers up fans many a great moment, with fans likely to go wild for the many side gags (Pokémon card collections, Pokémon posters), Pokémon character cameos and wink wink nudge nudge moments that litter the film from start to finish, making this fan service of the highest order, that tells us Detective Pikachu was made by fans for fans, a rare feat when it comes to such intellectual property as this.Final Say -One of 2019's genuinely nice surprises, Pokémon Detective Pikachu wonderfully brings to life a beloved property, that while aimed more directly at old fans rather than casual cinemagoers, provides a wonderfully enjoyable and colour-filled trip regardless.3 ½ staplers out of 5",Pokémon Detective Pikachu
26,leonblackwood,Disappointing! 4/10,4,6 January 2020,"Review:
Why do these filmmakers have to over-complicate the simplest of storylines? This is supposed to be a film for all ages, but there is so much technical jargon throughout the film, it just became a right mess. With that aside, the annoying leading characters, Tim Goodman (Justice Smith) and Lucy Stevens (Kathryn Newton), really couldn't act, and they made the film seem like it should be made for TV. Ryan Reynolds, who supplied the voice for Detective Pikachu, really saved the day, with his witty lines and unique sense of comedy, but he wasn't able to shine alongside such a weak cast and an awful storyline. We also didn't get to see the true powers of the Pokemon's, mainly because the director chose to concentrate on Tim's life story, which made the film extremely dull. On the plus side, there are some epic action scenes, and the CGI looked half decent, but I really was expecting more from this well-known franchise. The film is set in the Pokemon universe, was Tim Goodman is a 21-year-old insurance adjuster, who gave up his dream of being a Pokemon trainer following the death of his mother and becoming estranged from his father, Harry Goodman. Tim is contacted by the police of Ryme City, a city where humans and Pokemon live together in peace and catching and battling Pokemon is outlawed. He's told his father has died in a car accident. While visiting Harry's apartment, Tim meets a deerstalker clad Pikachu that is able to talk to Tim and be understood by him. At a cafe, Pikachu explains he has amnesia, and the only clue of his identity is Harry's name and address on his hat, leading him to believe he was Harry's partner. Because Pikachu survived the car crash, he surmises Harry also survived. Lieutenant Hideo Yoshido shows Tim security footage of Harry's accident to convince him that Harry could not have survived. Tim & Pikachu are contacted by Howard Clifford, the founder of Ryme City, who believes living with Pokemon is beneficial to his ailing condition. Howard shows Tim a holographic recreation of the car crash, revealing Harry survived and was captured by Mewto, who erased Pikachu's memory. Howard tells him that if he finds Mewto, he can find his father. Tim and Pikachu recruit Lucy and travel to the lab facility Harry was investigating, which had been experimenting on Mewto and synthesized R from his genes. After being attacked, by genetically enhanced Greninja, Pikachu is gravely injured during there escape. Tim manages to communicate to a Bulbasaur for help and they take Tim to a clearing where they meet Mewto. Mewto heals Pikachu, but before it can reveal its intentions, it is captured. Pikachu comes across the area where Harry crashed and finds evidence that it was the Greninja, not Mewto, who was responsible. Now, this is where it gets complicated, so I'm not going to try and explain what the hell happens next. Some of the plot is obvious from the beginning, so it won't be that surprising when you see how the whole story panes out, but the director really makes a meal of it. Although it's a watchable film, mainly because of Ryan Reynolds, I can't see myself watching it again in a hurry, and I can't see a sequel making as much profit as this did. It was a big task to take on a live-action version of Pokemon, especially with all the die-hard fans around the world, so I personally don't know why they didn't spend more money on the cast, and tone down the plot. On the whole, it's worth a one-watch but I was disappointed!Round-Up:
This movie was directed by Rob Letterman, who also brought you Shark Tale, Monsters vs. Aliens, Gulliver's Travels and Goosebumps. Judging by his previous movies, I'm not surprised that this movie turned out how it did. Don't get me wrong, I did enjoy Monsters vs. Aliens and Shark Tale, but his latest projects were a big flop. That's why this movie should have gone to a more established director, who could have made something special with this unique concept.Budget: $150million

27,TheMovieDiorama,Detective Pikachu used thunderbolt but was not very effective.,5,11 May 2019,"Ever since I touched a Gameboy Colour and inserted my cartridge for 'Pokémon Yellow', I was a fan. I invested my childhood into this franchise. I watched the anime, including the feature films. I collected the trading cards. I even walked around the entirety of my town catching wild Pokémon on my smartphone. Suffice to say, this intellectual property is part of me. It still is in fact! Which is why, with great sadness, I must report that this adaptation of the Nintendo 3DS video game is a crushing disappointment. Walking out of the cinema in silence, head to the ground as I pondered on what I just witnessed, sat in my car and suddenly let out an enraged outburst of curse words whilst banging my head on the steering wheel. Of all the films to be mediocre, why this one!? Pikachu just could not provide the electricity needed to make this mundane mystery captivating. After hearing the news about his father's death, a young boy finds out he can communicate with his dad's partner Pokémon (a Pikachu if you couldn't guess...) and sets out on an investigation to uncover what actually happened to him.The bustling urban environment of Ryme City, intertwining human inhabitants with tamed Pokémon, instantly released the fantasy magic that makes the series the success it is today. The dystopian futuristic architecture showcasing a ludicrous amount of bright vivid colours worked well in presenting the gorgeous cinematography. The decision to utilise real film, as opposed to digital methods, assisted in making the Pokémon look realistic. An important feature when they coexist with humans that share nearly every scene together, exhuming a natural civilisation. The interactions between Pokémon and humans were never questioned, feeding off the dreams that every child had when playing the video games. The CGI for most of the Pokémon looked decent, those with fur such as Pikachu and Psyduck especially. Others, like Mewtwo and Ditto, were terrible. Something that the visual effects team needed to get right considering the substantial budget.The plastic-like character models aren't the worst of the issues that this film unfortunately contains. Ready yourselves. Use ""Light Screen"" or ""Protect"", because I'm about to ""Hyper Beam"" this story to shreds! Understandably, the central mystery has to be simple in order for younger audiences to follow, considering they are the target audience. Fans, apparently according to the general consensus, will be enamoured by the fact that Bulbasaurs are aimlessly wandering through woodland areas and a Charizard breathes fire for a total of 2.87 seconds. So again, apparently, they are taken care of. Where does that leave everyone else? Bored.A senseless, predictable and consistently dull story that upholds no imagination whatsoever. Using the most basic of storytelling techniques that can really only found in children's TV shows. Hand-holding. Exposition. Plot conveniences. Tame ""thrills"" and ""twists"". The introductory travelling sequence to Ryme city is a two minute exposition scene on the entire Pokémon franchise. Pikachu, with every chance he gets, infuriatingly spells out every detail found in the story in case the audience were oblivious to the obvious. Probably didn't help there were an abundance of writers working on the same script, to which all chose to spoon-feed an already simple mystery and insult the intelligence of its audience. An absolute shame when considering the several emotional moments between the two lead characters.Fine, it's a light-hearted film. Don't take it so seriously! Just enjoy the comedy gold that is Ryan Reynolds, voicing an adorably fluffy Pikachu. Oh. Surprise surprise, this soulless fan failed to laugh once. The intentional comedy was incredibly hit and miss, with the vast majority having no effect. Like an electric Pokémon attacking a Geodude (urgh, bad memories...). That's not to say Reynolds was bad, he unsurprisingly packs more charm that Team Rocket's Meowth, just the dialogue he was given had the power of a Poké Ball as opposed to an Ultra Ball.Smith was also decent and had an infectious friendship with Pikachu. A credible performance considering he was talking to himself for the majority of filming. Nighy and Watanabe? Underused. Rita Ora? Let's move on. The worst written character and performance belongs to Newton as a plucky reporter with her crazy Psyduck. Like a weird anime cosplay that really has no purpose to the story. There are a few fan service moments, notably the theme tune and the amazing credits sequence, but not enough to make me taste that Nintendo nostalgic sauce.For what it's worth, it isn't a terrible film and one of the better video game adaptations. Yet for everything Detective Pikachu gets right, it inadvertently creates the same amount of issues. Putting aside my burning desire for this to be super effective, it still lacked the cinematic quality found in other family-friendly flicks such as 'Who Framed Roger Rabbit?' and is not nearly as fun as it thinks it is. Honestly, preferred the 'First Movie'...",Pokémon Detective Pikachu
28,matthewssilverhammer,Pokemon Don't Go.,3,17 May 2019,"If you took the dark, neon-lit streets of Blade Runner, filled them with Pokemon, then littered a dramatic mystery plot with Roger Rabbit humor, you'd have Pokemon Detective Pikachu. And before you get excited, those insanely disparate elements awkwardly battle each other like a Magikarp / Jynx match-up. And if you don't understand any of that, then stay far away. This is a supremely weird but uninspired children's film that's references are so niche even a passing fan of the franchise won't be able to ""catch 'em all"".
Anime has a history of playing in multiple genres at once, but Detective Pikachu takes the cake. The story (an orphan boy joins forces with a fast-talking Pikachu to solve the death of his father and uncover a deep-state conspiracy) is crushingly unfun, and even Reynolds's spattering of out-of-place jokes land flatter than a Stunfisk. I can't remember the last time I cared less about a group of characters, especially the lead wet-blanket of a human played by the usually charming Justice Smith. His arc is so forced I left the movie questioning why any of the story even happened.
Die-hard Pokemon fans seem to be finding enjoyment here, and I'd never deny them that. They've not only committed to the world, but this movie certainly does its due diligence to capture these unique monsters with technical care. Pikachu, Mr. Mime, Psyduck and Ditto are at the center of the story, and they are each used to fun, funny and cute effect at different times. Unfortunately the story they're given is such a soulless jumble of subpar noise, it does these impressive CG characters no favors. Pokemon Don't Go.",Pokémon Detective Pikachu
29,southdavid,Mew-ve along please.,5,31 May 2019,"I wasn't going to see ""Pokemon: Detective Pikachu"". Despite my nerd life I was just a little too old for Pokemon and to be fair the trailer made this look like more of a kids film, than a family one. However, I read a review somewhere that said this wasn't the case, so decided to give it a try. Though not awful, I certainly came away underwhelmed by the experience.Justice Smith plays Tim, a young man who begins to investigate the disappearance of his father, a noted journalist. His investigation takes him to Ryme City, a neon metropolis (that's clearly London in a few scenes) where humans live alongside Pokemon, animal companions usually used for fighting but here involved in all facets of life. Here he meets Detective Pikachu, his father's companion who has mysteriously lost his memory and, even more mysteriously, appears to be able to talk directly to Tim.As I say then, ""Pokemon: Detective Pikachu"" is more of a kids film, than a family one. I don't mean that to be inherently dismissive, I have enjoyed a number of kids films over the years. But in this instance it consistently means ""not enough"". The action scenes are alright, but not really enough, the comedy is OK, but not really enough, the plot is . . . actually the plot is pretty weird. It's big spoiler territory to go much further, but there are some problems to the villain's overall plan that don't stand up to any real scrutiny. This might have something to do with the film having seven credited writers, with ideas left in or not fully thought out.I didn't hate it though. Ryan Reynolds is as likable as ever. Justice Smith is an engaging character, who I actually cared about. The effects are usually pretty good, with Pikachu himself being excellent throughout. It's just that it all doesn't add to something that lives long in the memory. (And the funniest lines and scenes are all in the trailer). That said, every kid who I was within earshot of loved it, so they're probably doing something right.",Pokémon Detective Pikachu
30,Vartiainen,"Very cool world and visuals, but that's about it",6,23 June 2019,"Like so many others of my generation, I too grew up loving Pokémon. And it has never really gone away, with the advent and rise of Pokémon Go and such. The original games are still going strong, as is the TV series. So, a live-action adaptation was pretty much inevitable.And to the film's credit, there is passion behind it. The world of Pokémon comes alive beautifully, full of these fascinating critters that we simply adore. Sure, live-action CGI makes some of them more than a bit creepy, but then again, some of them are supposed to be creepy. Plus, some of the time it makes them much scarier than they were in the animated series, which in turn works rather nicely.So yes, full marks for the visuals, all the different Pokémon and the world building in general. Whenever there's a Pokémon on screen - and especially whenever they do battle - the film works really well. Unfortunately that's not even half of the film. Because, there are of course human characters. There is a plot dealing with human problems. Pokémon are there, but they're more of a side dish. Sure, they're needed for the conflict and its resolution, but the plot would not need much tweaking to remove them all together. And, for example, the main emotional conflict of the film is purely between humans.And, yes, I do know why they did it. It's simply so much easier to write such a film. Admittedly, with better actors and a rewrite or two, this might have worked wonderfully. Alas, the actors are really not up to bar and the whole narrative runs on tracks, with very few deviations from tired clichés.To be fair, the final act has some clever twists and I can't outright state that I was ever really bored with the film, but I can only imagine what this film could have been like if it had been a pure Pokémon adventure, like in the animated series.Still, for a Pokémon fan, there is good stuff in this film. And all the bad stuff is merely annoyingly average and banal instead of outright awful. If you want to see a more realistic looking Pokémon world, I do urge you to give this film a shot.",Pokémon Detective Pikachu
31,lisafordeay,Good movie based on the TV show Pokemon(Spoilers),7,18 May 2019,"Detective Pikachu is a 2019 Action Fantasy Comedy directed by Rob Letterman who also directed Goosebumps and stars Deadpool's Ryan Reynolds as Pikachu and Paper Towns Justice Smith. It tells the story of a 21 year old teenager named Tim who's father Harry Goodman goes missing after he was involved in a car crash (some say his dead) and it's up to Tim and his father's Pokemon Pikachu(voiced by Ryan Reynolds) to find out more about Tim's father's dissaperance and defeat a villian played by Bill Nighy and save the world.Also starring Rita Ora in a cameo,this film is packed with great humour,great story and a twist that had me going huh so this person is actually here and this person voices a charcther(will thrown spoiler alert after this). Overall I enjoyed this film and so did my brother and my mom.Spoiler alert
The spoiler is Ryan Reynolds who plays two parts in this film. He voices Pikachu as well as playing Tim's estranged dad as his father's conscious went into his Pokemon Pikachu hence the reason Pikachu talks in the film as he was left for dead and Mewtwo sends Tim's dad's soul into Pikachu. Plus Mewtwo gets controlled by Bill Nighy near the climax scene.

32,jtindahouse,Enough here for all ages to enjoy,6,16 June 2019,"It's very rare that I ever watch kid's movies any more. I couldn't even tell you what the last one I saw before this was. But 'Pokémon Detective Pikachu' just really interested me for some reason. I'm not even much of a 'Pokémon' fan (I watched it briefly as a kid, but that was about it). I think it was the casting choice of Ryan Reynolds as 'Pikachu' that took my fancy. A really enlightened choice. He has the comedic skills to make anything funny, and ultimately that is the strongest thing this movie has going for it.I also loved the concept of the story being based around a mystery. I'm a sucker for mysteries in films. Unfortunately the one they chose for this movie didn't really work for me. It just never hooked me in. I didn't absolutely need to know the answer, and that is always the key to a mystery element working in a story.The other thing that impressed me was how good the animation was. The 'Pokémon' looked absolutely fantastic. I think this is a great movie in the sense that kids are going to have a great time with it, but also the adults that take them along are going to enjoy it more than they might other children's movies. A worthy effort.",Pokémon Detective Pikachu
33,DarkVulcan29,Quite a fun time,9,13 May 2019,"I've never been a Pokémon fan, but this movie doesn't make any more of a fan of it, although I really did enjoy it. Comes across kid friendly with some adult moments in it. Effects are beyond terrific.
I don't want to tell you too much about this, cause I don't want to give too much away. But everybody plays it pretty well, Ryan Reynolds is perfect has the voice of Pikachu, and Justice Smith plays off the CGI Pikachu quite well. The story line keeps the film going to the point it never gets boring. Any Pokémon fans will find this a guilty pleasure.",Pokémon Detective Pikachu
34,stevendbeard,Not A Pokemon Fan,6,13 May 2019,"I saw ""Pokemon Detective Pikachu"", starring Ryan Reynolds-the Deadpool movies, Green Lantern; Justice Smith-Jurassic World:Fallen Kingdom, Paper Towns; Kathryn Newton-Big Little Lies_tv, Blockers and Bill Nighy-About Time, Fot Fuzz.
This is based on a video game-or anime series, depending on who you ask-and it is a live action and CGI combo. First of all, let me clarify things; I am not a Pokeman fan. So true fans will probably enjoy this movie more than I did-the action was suitable but sometimes, I was a little clueless about what was going on and who some of the characters were. Ryan does the voice of Pikachu and another live person-I won't spoil it here. Justice plays a young man looking for his missing-presumed dead-father, who was a private detective on a case. Justice's search leads to Ryan, a Pokeman character, that wants to help him find his father. It seems that Ryan has amnesia now but he does remember that he used to be Justice's fathers' partner. There is a city called Ryme City where humans and Pokemons live together in perfect harmony with no fighting. Everywhere else, humans put on fights using the Pokemons and even bet on them. Bill plays the CEO of the company responsible for Ryme City and Kathryn plays a reporter/love interest for Justice. For all the fans, there is a character called Mewtwo that is instrumental.
It's rated ""PG"" for action/peril and some rude humor and has a running time of 1 hour & 44 minutes.
It's not one that I would buy on DVD-I did mention that I am not a fan-but you might buy it, if you are a fan. Otherwise, it would be a good rental.",Pokémon Detective Pikachu

Most of the other pokemon are less convincing but they're good enough and selling me this mixed society managed to avoid feeling too Roger Rabbit if you know what I mean.The human drama isn't laid on too thick but it's still a part of the conflict. There's definitely a few surprises thrown in that made this a superbly satisfying adventure movie that I quite regret not catching in the theatres.",Pokémon Detective Pikachu
37,CubsandCulture,"Weird film, wish it was weirder.",8,11 May 2019,"I don't have much connection to Pokemon. I played (and only played) PokemonGo for about 20 minutes when it first came out. I saw like 1/2 of an episode of the TV show. I don't think I can name more than 3 pokemon types (? I mean like species). I only saw this film because of Reynolds. Anyway, despite lacking all the background I really enjoyed the film. The central conceit of combining a noirish buddy film with a bright colorful fantasia was goofy but highly entertaining. The film is just flat out weird in places. But it is never confusing. The plot, such as it is, had enough red herrings to hide the big twists. And there was just enough character stuff to be more than just a goofy comedic noir fantasia.The best feature of the film is just the world. The various pokemon are all rendered in lovely CGI and the designs looked really good. The creatures are all so offbeat and colorful. There were a few that were really color in conception. I do wish the film spent a smidgen more time explaining the rules of the world. I not sure if some of the powers that the plot depends were cheats or not. (Not that this really matters).Reynolds is good in this. He is very funny and umm likable. Detective Pikachu has sort of the same subversive edge and irrelevancy that Deadpool has without crossing over into adult humor (mostly). The movie has a big farce feel to it that makes the goofiness charming.If anything I think the film should have pushed some of its stylistic conceits more. The film was just begging for one sequence shot in moody black and white. 'Wouldn't mind a sequel.",Pokémon Detective Pikachu

Justice Smith and Kathryn Newton, both of whom I was unaware of, are decent as Tim and Lucy.The special effects are nice, while the plot is good if not amazing.

To be fair, this isn't the first time Pokémon has been released on the big screen, but this is certainly the widest release of the case, and certainly the most impressive. Detective Pikachu does have its struggles, it gets caught up within its own plot, and seems to have trouble on deciding a clear path or story to focus on, but that isn't to say (even with some uneven transitions) that its not fun to watch. The film shines with gorgeous CGI and some wonderful and amusing settings of which bring this culture phenomenon to life in some very interesting ways. The actors are nothing too special, but Ryan Reynolds does do a pretty great job as the yellow detective himself. The film is also quite funny, and nothing in the humor feels too out of place, and neither do the events in the film itself. In the end, Detective Pikachu is one heck of an entertaining ride, and proves to not only be fun for kids, but for longtime fans as well. Is it great? No. Is it a blast? Absolutely.

World Building
NostalgiaSummary:
The movie may look incredibly lame, but within the labs of the Pokémon studios they actually crafted a movie that is very fun. Much of this has to do with the voice acting, primarily Ryan Reynolds pulling his Deadpool delivery, just in a more censored way. Pikachu spouting the sarcasm and wit of the mercenary with a mouth had me laughing, and the background dialogue he provides is so simplistic, but yet so powerful at the same time. Alongside the other actors who are not CGI, he manages to establish fun relationships, primarily with Justice Smith, who make this modern odd couple relationship. It works extremely well, and established an atmosphere of not only funny, but also cute as the bond between Pokémon and partner shine. Yet the comedy is only one aspect of the film, and the movie goes surprisingly deep in some of this character development and plot concepts. There are plenty of adult themes that I can't say much to avoid spoiling, but the movie really pulls at heart strings that may be very relevant to some. It's the extra layer that expands the audience age and increases the enjoyment to many more.
Yet the other aspect I really enjoyed was the world building and nostalgia that came into this movie. Rhyme City is a nice blend of the things that make a Pokémon city great for us gamers, integrating CGI with real life shots to make a believable world that could be inhabited by Pokémon. The 2-d models were great for the games, but the 3-D textures and depth added to the Pokémon really gives them a more realistic sheen that fit in the live action. Not quite the realism all the way, but a fantastic start to future installments if they make more. Even better for fans like me though, is the search for nostalgia that packs the film more than zubats fill the rock tunnel. Fans like me will enjoy the search for shout outs to all the spin offs this series has taken found in dialog, jokes, and even memorabilia that are just sitting in the wings to be discovered. This added layer should please the fan base and still not distract from the other components of the movie.DISLIKES:More Pokémon
More Excitement
Predictable Plot
Dead End plots
Convoluted PlotSUMMARY:
The movie did well, but there was some more fleshing out needed to assist with maximizing it's potential. For one thing, more Pokémon would have been welcomed to see in the city. I'm not sure if they ran into budget, time constraints, or are planning a future with more Pokémon movies, but I would have liked to have seen more of the critters in the world. The movie took a few templates and then only used them over and over again. Fortunately many of these are fan favorites, but there were others I were hoping would contribute to the plot rather than remaining background. This is definitely true of the battle scenes, which would have been great for both a plot and adventure aspect. There were a few battle scenes that held promise, but they quickly were diluted to more comedy and while funny, there could have been a little more bang for the buck had they actually brought the battle service to life. This is especially true when it comes to the finale of the story, which leads me to the next limitation for this reviewer.
Aesthetics aside, the movie's main struggle comes in the limited story that seems weighed down by comedy and fan service. The first thing is the predictability of the plot, a combination of trailers and obvious, clichéd foreshadowing there is not much surprise in terms of the secrets held in this mystery. My friends and I had six of the seven revelations down well before revelation and it was only about waiting for the revelation rather than the impact. Next, the movie tries to pursue that deeper tone we talked about earlier, but truncates the plots before they build any steam. Justice Smith's story, holds many emotional moments, but they are bluntly dropped in the favor of more comedy. Other stars recruited into the film and the characters they portray are fairly limited as well, and the underutilization of the human and digital cast makes for a greatly missed opportunity to expand the plot and the characters. Perhaps in doing this, the last dislike of the convoluted and nonsensical story would have made a little sense. Like a fan service story, the twist that happens is okay, a bit of an overstretch that gets points for originality, but came out a bit corny for me other than trying to introduce more fan service. Had they maybe put a more climactic finish and not gone quite Sci-Fi based service, we might have been okay and had a better overall finish to the building story.VERDICT:Overall Detective Pikachu is one of the better video game movies to hit the silver screen, accomplishing the goal of hitting a variety of audience members and bringing a fun, cute and deep adventure with it. It's going to hit both super fans and new fans alike in regards to the world it creates, and with Ryan Reynolds leading the way is sure to bring laughs to the bunch. Yet the movie gets a little too focused on pleasing all audiences that it does not maximize that potential. Detective Pikachu's story is the primary limitation in that there was so much more to behold, and should a second movie arise, I hope they will focus on more Pokémon and character integration than pure comedy and fandom. Still a nice adventure for many and one worthy of a theater trip for most, and a home viewing for the rest.My scores are:Action/Adventure/Comedy: 8.0

52,justin-fencsak,Judging by the reviews on IMDB and positive feedback in Japan...i might catch this movie...,7,7 May 2019,"When it comes to video game movies, every one of them sucks. Heck, even Tomb Raider was forgettable by the time the remake came out. Then came Detective Pikachu, based on the still strong Pokemon franchise. This movie looks like it's gonna have legs and make some money based on its star power and the characters. Here it is...a live action Pokemon movie based on a video game of the same name based on the franchise which has been around since the 90s and has seen a resurgence due to Pokemon go , a mobile game that took the world by storm and allowed people with their phones to go outside and find virtual creatures, some of which are in this movie for the first time as CGI characters. Sonic the Hedgehog, take notice!!!",Pokémon Detective Pikachu
53,WeAreLive,Finally a live action pokemon,8,24 July 2019,"I admit I always wanted to have a live action ever since I was a kid and everytime I watched Pokemon, I always wonder what they would look like in real life. However, as I have mentioned in the past that I lost track of pokemon as I grew older but when this movie came out I decided to see it.While, I am not a big fan of how anime has been adapted into live action (yes, I am looking at you Dragon ball evolution) but this movie was rather decent for an americanized live action anime movie. The CGI was pretty good too without going overboard with it. Though some of the pokemon designs were a bit creepy but still okay.Although, I am a bit confused why Ash was not in the movie. However, I enjoyed this movie overall, while it is not as good as the Pokemon anime it was still enjoyable for what it is and is a childhood dream come true.",Pokémon Detective Pikachu
54,TedStixonAKAMaximumMadness,"""Pokémon: Detective Pikachu""- The beloved franchise's first foray into live-action is a charming and nostalgic success that should please longtime fans.",8,29 July 2019,"Whelp, it looks like the dark age of mediocre-at-best video-game movies may finally be at an end... and thank goodness! And all it took was a bit of creativity, respect for the source material and a delightful electric mouse to do it!""Pokémon: Detective Pikachu"" is the first live-action film to stem from the beloved and long-running franchise created by Satoshi Tajiri. Directed by Rob Letterman of ""Goosebumps"" fame, the film succeeds largely thanks of its clever use of nostalgic appeal, phenomenal world-building and another fantastic performance from Ryan Reynolds, who provides the voice of the titular crime-solver. And after twenty-six years of almost universally sub-par adaptations, I think it's safe to say... it is the best video-game movie yet!Tim Goodman (Justice Smith) is a 21-year-old insurance salesman and former Pokémon trainer whose life isn't going very well. Especially when he learns that his police detective father Harry has been killed in the line of duty at the idyllic Ryme City. However, not everything is as it seems... and soon enough Tim encounters his father's former partner, a Pikachu (Reynolds) who he somehow has the ability to understand, and who believes Harry is still alive. Setting off to learn what really happened, they eventually join forces with a wannabe reporter (Kathryn Newton) and her Psyduck pal, and discover that the mystery goes far deeper than they could have ever imagined...As someone who grew up in the heyday of ""Pokémon Fever"" in the late 90's and early 2000's, I was something of a franchise fan back in the day. I played through the original North American releases of Red, Blue and Yellow, I watched the early ""Indigo League"" episodes of the long-running anime series, and of course I collected the first few expansions of the trading card game. And though I drifted from the series around the time Ruby and Sapphire came out, suffice to say, I do have a certain nostalgic attachment to the overall beast that is ""Pokémon.""And ""Detective Pikachu"" is exactly the sort-of film it needed to be to appeal to that child inside me. It pays nonstop tribute to the franchise through fun winks and nods, and comes across as a complete love-letter to the fans with clever references abound. (I won't spoil anything specific, but fans of the anime series will surely get a kick out of a certain storyline that ties almost directly into events from one of the animated feature-films.) As a former fan myself, I couldn't help but grin ear-to-ear from the opening scene through the end credits. If you grew up on ""Pokémon,"" I really can't help but imagine that you'll fall in love with the film immediately.But perhaps the best aspect of the film is its immense and extremely well-executed world-building. From its first moments, ""Detective Pikachu"" plunges you into the world of Pokémon, and it is exquisitely handled. Director Letterman guides us through the film in such a way that it is both accessible for newcomers while also feeling familiar to fans. He gives us just enough information to bring us in... and lets us piece the rest of it together ourselves. Never over-explaining or under-explaining any part of the experience, and often using clever and subtle means to enhance the film... like faint things that are barely visible in the background, or street-signs you barely notice as they pass by the camera. It makes the world feel real and lived-in. Like you could walk right in through the screen. A lesser filmmaker would have likely ground the film to a halt and over-indulged in the proceedings. But Letterman is clever to avoid this pitfall. And I really appreciated it.I also really enjoyed the cast, and they give the film much of its immense charm. Particularly Ryan Reynolds as the voice of Pikachu. While there is the inevitable comparison to be made to Reynolds' trademark character ""Deadpool,"" I actually think he makes Pikachu his own character. He knows when to ham it up with a good, dumb joke and when to play it straight. I also really enjoyed Smith and Newton as our key human characters. While Newton does play her part a bit broad, it worked for the light-hearted tone the film set, and I thought she was absolutely adorable. I also quite enjoyed the iconic Bill Nighy as the enigmatic benefactor of Ryme City, and a small but fun turn from the always-reliable Ken Watanabe as a police detective Tim encounters several times throughout the story. That add a bit of class to the proceedings.If I were to pinpoint any place where the film falls flat, I would say that the movie can often play it a bit too ""safe."" I think it was a necessary evil in this case, as you don't want to overwhelm the average filmgoer who may not be familiar with Pokémon, but the story and the various arcs the characters go through are a tad-bit... stock. You can pretty much guess the twists and turns the story is going to take, and there's only a few real surprises to be had if you're at all familiar with basic story-structure. Still, I do think it was better to play it safe now to bring in an audience, and that a potential sequel could later take more risks.""Pokémon: Detective Pikachu"" was an absolute blast for this former fan of the series. While its writing is a bit predictable, the fabulous world-building, nostalgic appeal and top-notch cast make it a very fun film that the whole family can enjoy. And I can't wait to see where a follow-up may take us next! I'm giving it a very good 8 out of 10.",Pokémon Detective Pikachu
55,fntstcplnt,Detective Pikachu (2019),3,10 January 2020,"Directed by Rob Letterman. Starring Justice Smith, Kathryn Newton, Ken Watanabe, Bill Nighy, Omar Chaparro, Chris Geere, (voice) Ryan Reynolds. (PG)In an alternate reality (à la ""Who Framed Roger Rabbit"") where humans coexist with strange creatures called Pokémon, Smith visits the detective office of his presumed deceased father and meets the fellow's partner, a small, yellow Pokémon called Pikachu (voiced by Reynolds). Adaptation/riff on the popular video game franchise is curiously rushed but sluggish; too much happening for the uninitiated to clearly follow, yet the story plods from one uninvolving incident to the next. The effects are uneven but often colorful (especially the titular furball and friendly blue creatures with what look like big onions or flower buds on their backs); interest in the characters, the mystery, and the villainous plot ebbs with each passing minute. Reynolds has a few amusing moments, but the PG-rating neuters the self-congratulatory irreverence he's known for (he also briefly appears in the flesh). Smith, on the other hand, doesn't register anything besides being a bland everyman avatar a player can plug into. Fans may enjoy spotting their favorite ""pocket monsters""; everyone else can just glance and shrug.33/100",Pokémon Detective Pikachu
56,arungeorge13,"Enjoyable for what it is; not much to look back at, later! [+61%]",6,8 June 2019,"Pokémon Detective Pikachu initially did have, by all means, the look and feel of yet another video-game-movie dud. But it's not, and the majority of that credit goes to Ryan Reynold's great voiceover act as Pikachu, the excellent CGI (most of it has been executed well), and plenty of Easter eggs for die-hard fans of the Pokemon media franchise.The storyline is predictably generic playing out in the style of levels/missions in a videogame - Pokemon, humans, and a corporate (which has some sinister intentions), all part of it. The protagonist here is Tim (played by Justice Smith), who hasn't had much of a connection with his scientist-and-Pokemon expert dad Harry. He arrives in Ryme City (a place where Pokemon and humans co-exist without rules) after he hears the news of his dad's demise in a car crash but things quickly take a turn when he runs into his dad's Pokemon partner Pikachu. What's surprising here is that Tim can converse with Pikachu.From there on, it's a fun ride till the end. Reynolds is a perfect fit for the voice of Pikachu, and director Rob Letterman ensures that his selection is justified by assigning the best (and funniest, of course) lines to him. Smith is an okay choice for the protagonist, and somehow the film's tonal inconsistency does him no favors. The film's energy levels peak whenever Kathryn Newton (who plays Lucy, Tim's sidekick, but definitely could have had more screen-time) is on screen.Also, the makers throw in a lot of nostalgia by in fact creating a whole new universe filled with some of the easily identifiable Pokemon (such as Charmeleon, Bulbasaur, Psyduck, and more) from both the cartoon and video-game series. There's a fair bit of spoon-feeding (Pikachu keeps running his mouth along the lines of ""Oh, so that's how it happened!"" whenever some key plot-points are elucidated) though, which probably might be okay for the younger viewers but older viewers might find that a bit of a turn-off. Knowing the film's family-friendly vibe, it's easy to know that even when the protagonists have to deal with umpteen do-or-die situations, they're going to emerge largely unharmed.The good thing with the film is that it doesn't really try to be THE ULTIMATE Pokemon movie and is mostly content with the (limited) world-building it gets to do in its 97-minute run-time. Therefore, you may not come away with the feeling of having watched something as groundbreaking as The Lego Movie, but it should leave you sufficiently happy. On the other hand, if you have had no prior exposure to the Pokemon franchise before (and its intriguing aspects such as Poke Balls, Pokemon battles, the behavioral traits of several Pokemon and their stages of evolution), you might not fully buy into what the writers and director envisioned. Instead, it could turn out to be just another 'feel-good movie' experience.The skillful blend of CGI and live action is a feast for the eyes nonetheless and should keep viewers engaged for the most part.",Pokémon Detective Pikachu
57,Abdulxoxo,Weak,6,10 January 2021,"Part in the story was down to the plot; but also in the way the human characters are written. Straight up I thought they were all terrible. Smith's character is boring. The journalist Lucy Stevens, who is also Tim's sort of love interest, is boring. The actual pokemon are somewhat fun, but the humans are so poorly written. I can't complain too much about the pokemon themselves. I wish the visual effects could have been better, but sadly this clearly isn't working with an 'Avengers' type of budget. Ryan Reynolds is probably the stand out performer in this film. He is pretty funny and he basically played the lite version of Deadpool. One of the best aspects of this film is the production design. The cityscape design is really cool. I also like some of the grimy underground sets. The soundtrack is also good. Overall, this film is a bit of a disappointment but at least I was entertained if nothing else.",Pokémon Detective Pikachu

59,Troy_Campbell,"Colourful, cheery and charismatic - but also lightweight.",6,11 May 2019,"Prior to watching this family-friendly adventure, I had never consumed an iota of Pokémon content. I've watched none of the anime TV series or movies, I've never played any of the numerous video games, and I've never collected or played with the trading cards. Of course I knew the absolute basics of this world (I did live through the Pokémon Go phenomena after all), but otherwise I was going into this film with zero expectations, other than hoping for a fun, goofy ride. It delivers... to an extent. The puzzle-to-be-solved plot is meagre and relatively predictable - the twists aren't as ""twisty"" as Pikachu likes to think - but the light-hearted joy of hanging out with the furry yellow sleuth (voiced by Ryan Reynolds) compensates for it. Reynolds turns his wise-cracking way up, albeit within the confines of a PG rating, making Pikachu the perfect partner for Justice Smith's emotionally anguished Tim Goodman, a young man on the hunt for his estranged Dad's killer. Once together they embark on a collection of set pieces that show off other Pokémon, including a fiery battle with the dragon-esque Charizard, an amusing 'chase' and interrogation with Mr Mime, and a colossal escape from the ground-breaking Torterra. The climactic save-the-city sequence, set in the fictional Ryme City that appears to have once been London, doesn't stick the landing; which is a shame considering the antagonist Mewtwo - a sinister, magical kangaroo-esque creature - is conceptually pretty badass. A colourful and cheery caper that is best viewed with the brain switched off, Detective Pikachu offers just enough charisma and humorous hijinks to satisfy across its runtime.",Pokémon Detective Pikachu

Now, after I've seen the end result I have to say that it's neither crappy nor a masterpiece. In a way the film reminded me of other franchises like the Marvel universe: well-known characters, a lot of punchlines and some action to glue it together. The ending was a it weak in my opinion, I didn't really buy the big reveal but apart from that there are some pretty funny elements and scenes. Jokes about lampshades are unnecessary, though.All in all you can have quite some fun with this and I don't feel like the legacy of Pokémon was mistreated here.

Also, I found the CGI subpar in this day and age, even though I do understand the challenge of staying close to the cutesy Pokemon vibe while mixing in actual people. But all in all, they had a fairly good story and decent writing; however, I easily give an extra 1 or 2 stars for Ryan Reynolds who does a fantastic job with the voice over. That is the only reason why this movie can be enjoyed by kids but enough humor for adults to chuckle here and there.",Pokémon Detective Pikachu
62,Stephen_A_Abell,A Highly Enjoyable Detective Romp... That Should Have Been Better...,7,2 September 2019,"So there's finally a live-action - nearly - Pokemon movie... I thought it would be better.The story is the best thing about this film. The concept of making it a detective story is brilliant. So a big thanks go to all the Nintendo people who came up with the idea when they created the game. It allows the writers to develop stronger characters and a more convoluted and conspiracy-driven story than with the original concept.When Tim Goodman (Justice Smith) receives word that his father is missing he decides to head to Ryme City to investigate. Ryme City is an evolved city. Both humans and Pokemon live together and work together in peace and unity. While in the city Tim comes across a Pikachu who only he can understand. The Pikachu. who used to be Tim's father's partner on the police force, teams up with Tim to find Harry. While investigating they find that something strange and dangerous is happening to the other Pokemon in the city.The comedy element comes chiefly from Ryan Reynalds as Pikachu, with his wise-cracks and his brilliant vocal acting talents. There are a few slapstick moments thrown in for extra laughs.The direction by Rob Letterman is above average but this film is missing something that his others had. It's hard to put my finger on but I think it's the lack of atmosphere. Though you relate to the characters you don't quite feel for them. It would have been nice to have some tension intermingled with the excitement. There were quite a few scenes where this could have been achieved. The secret lab. The fall from the Torterra. The first meeting with MewTwo.There's also missing chemistry in the relationships. Though Tim is completely heartbroken by Pikachu being injured you only see it and don't feel it. Other relationships in the movie would have added strength to the film had there been emotion and feelings between them, even negative ones.Now to the special effects. These are not always at their best. Most of the time the CGI is beautifully constructed and rendered. In particular, the Torterra is superb and looks the most realistic. Pikachu is good but Psyduck looks better, he even wears dirt better. It's MewTwo that lets the artists down. Its rendering makes it appear two dimensional at times. If this was their intention it doesn't quite work as the other Pokemon have far more detail to them. At the least, they could have textured the skin a little. This would have allowed for slight random shadowing giving it a more realistic appearance.Then when we get to the climax of the story the conclusion feels awkward and unrealistic.All that said, this is still a humorous and mightily enjoyable film and well worth a watch or three. I know I'll be hitting the play button again on this feature. I would readily recommend it for all the family... and you don't have to wait until it's raining outside... just put it on and enjoy.",Pokémon Detective Pikachu

Now, it's a source of great nostalgia for so many millennial. Pokemon Detective Pikachu was made for us. Quintessential fan service. But expect nothing more than that.This is a brain-numbing experience. There is no real story or anything that makes any sense in this movie. If you've never seen or heard of Pokemon before, you will be hopelessly lost here. That's a flaw, for certain. But make no mistake, if you came for Ryan Reynolds as Pikachu, you will love it. He's electric.. mind the pun. It's Deapool, without the curse words. I never thought I wanted to see a wise-cracking Pikachu, but i'm please that I did. Many other Pokemon (Pokemen?) appear in the background and foregrounds of the film, yet I could't help but notice so many that were left out and too many that kept repeating. That's kind of lazy. We aren't working with 150 of them anymore either.

70,rockman182,Detective Pikachu (2019),7,15 May 2019,"I think we all were collectively bewildered when the trailer for this film came out. A live action Pokemon film is something I would have expected years ago, when Pokemon was really at its height. Nonetheless, it came out and featured a talking Pikachu voiced by Ryan Reynolds. I know enough about Pokemon from the youth and watched the first few series with the original 150 Pokemon so I thought this would be a good watch. I thought it was ambitious and nice to see the all these little fuzzy creatures come to live but its a very standard affair plot-wise and feels slow.The film is about a young man who questions the ""death"" of his father. His father was a detective and the circumstances of his disappearance are mysterious. he befriends a Pikachu, who only he can hear talk. In a city where Pokemon and humans co-exist in daily life there is trouble brewing with a mysterious and supremely powerful Mewtwo running amok. I was surprised that the film included Mewtwo. I do love the first Pokemon movie so when the trailer revealed Mewtwo I knew I wanted to see it.The live action depictions of the Pokemon are generally great (needed more Squirtle though). I wish some of the more familiar and popular Pokemon from the show featured more often but it was a decent job done visually and an ambitious idea indeed. Rob Letterman means well trying to bring another fan favorite childhood franchise to life (much like Goosebumps) but like with that film the story doesn't hit at all times. The main character played by Justice Smith is generic to the core and not someone I found interesting. I'd say Ryan Reynolds as Pikachu does a great deal of carrying as far as the film is concerned.The plot is dull and slow at times and the way it progresses just goes from a cliched nature to transpiring un-entertaining events. In a world as lively as Ryme City the plot doesn't match what the film could have accomplished. Its really not a bad film but I think with the expectations and the concept, the film could have just gone above and beyond what we actually got. I'm sure a franchise is on its way but I do hope for better in future installments.6.5/10",Pokémon Detective Pikachu
71,Benjamin-M-Weilert,A surprisingly faithful franchise adaptation into live action.,7,2 June 2019,"The transition of nostalgia into live action can be a tricky business. Plenty of franchises have faltered in this aspect, so it was interesting to see Pokémon approach it from a side angle. Instead of adapting the core series of games or anime to a live-action adaptation, they instead used a spinoff game as the framework to create this movie. Despite my initial skepticism, I can honestly say that Detective Pikachu (2019) works much better than any video game franchise adaptation before it. It's not entirely perfect, but it came a lot closer than any of its predecessors.On the plus side, the ""realistic"" Pokémon were enthralling-if not wholly terrifying (I'm looking at you, Ludicolo)-to see in a real space interacting with humans. I already had a bit of a visceral reaction to seeing realistic fur, skin, and feathers on Pokémon when I played Pokken Tournament DX. At least they certainly seemed to be at home in this world that the filmmakers created. Nothing seemed out of place, which was a testament to the team who managed to remain reasonably faithful to the source material of the franchise. I was almost frustrated with how fast some scenes zipped past, as I wanted to pause and see if I could identify all the Easter eggs and references.While this certainly satiated my nostalgia, some moments reminded me, ""Oh, yeah . . . this is a movie for kids."" Sure, Ryan Reynolds gets a few lines in that the parents in the audience will laugh at, but there was this weird in-between space where I could identify with the main character even if the plot was simplified so the youngsters could understand it. I know they're going to try and appeal to the broadest demographic possible, which just so happens to have a wide age range due to the fact that Pokémon is still a relatively strong franchise today as it was over 20 years ago.A surprisingly faithful franchise adaptation into live action, I give Detective Pikachu 3.5 stars out of 5.",Pokémon Detective Pikachu
72,RforFilm,"A wild movie appears! Pokémon: Detective Pikachu strikes with laughs and Pokémon, but is ineffective with a standard story",6,16 May 2019,"A wild Pikachu appears! Do we attack it? Do we run? Or do we try to catch it...along with the other one hundred and fifty Pokémon? This is the premise of the first Pokémon game that I played back when I was in middle school. It made for a fun ""on the go"" game as it was long and had a variety of creatures to capture. There was (and still is) also an anime where we saw young Ash as he traveled the world with his Pikachu to become a Pokémon master and battle them against gym leaders. Some might call this a part of the company's marketing and some call it a great work of art.As far as I'm concerned, it was a nice piece of nostalgia, though I don't follow it as closely as I did as a kid. I think it had to do with the fact that it kept adding more Pokémon to the roster, demanding more of my time, and thus, losing my interest when the plot got more confusing. It comes as no surprise that Hollywood would want to make a movie out of this (There had already been several animated movies before). Let's see how Pokémon: Detective Pikachu does as bringing these creatures to the real world.In an alternate world where humans and Pokémon coexist, a young insurance salesman Tim Goodman (played by Justice Smith) is content to neither have a Pokémon companion nor catch one. When he hears of his dad presumably killed in a car crash, he takes a train to a metropolis called Ryme City, where Pokémon battles aren't allowed and encourage a unity between the species. He visits his father's friend detective Hideo Yoshida (played by Ken Watanabe) for information and also meets an aspiring journalist Lucy Stevens (played by Kathryn Newton) and her Psyduck Pokémon.When Tim goes to his dad's apartment, he discovers not only a Pikachu (played by Ryan Reynolds) with a hat on, but it can talk to him. He realizes that only he can understand him, but that it may have something to do with his dad's death. They both agree to team up and dwell into Ryme city. This involves other Pokémon, a Pokémon battle with a dragon-like Charizard, a mystery involving the head of Ryme City Howard Clifford (played by Bill Nighy) and a clone creature called a Mewtwo.How many times did I use the word Pokémon? A lot, and that's something you should know. This movie was made for Pokémon fans and this movie is unlikely to change that if otherwise. As a casual fan, I thought the movie was okay. In fact, whenever it wasn't doing something Pokémon related, things would become boring. To go into better detail, the best thing about the movie is the Pokémon and their use in this world. I admire the movie for creating it's own world rather then try and stick them into our world. Each creature looks great without compromising it's cartoon-like quality from the games. This is simply a place where these things exist like the toons in Who Framed Roger Rabbit.Speaking of which, the movie can succeed if it's duo works. The problem is that only half of it actually fires. Ryan Reynolds as Pikachu got a lot of laughs out of me. I was worried it would become another Deadpool, but he manages to make it his own (and the movie does explain why he talks and why Justice Smith can understand him). The problem I have is with the human. Justice Smith was annoying in Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom and while he isn't as annoying, his character is too bitter and depressing to sympathize with. The rest of the actors do fine...if the script had given them more to do.Also going back to Who Framed Roger Rabbit, the movie as a similar premise and plot of a human teaming with an animated character. It seems a lot of these types of movies follow the same plot. I won't knock on the film for that, but I will say the joy of the game and anime was about the catching and battling of Pokémon. I kind of wished the first live action Pokémon movie would had had a lot more of that.I'll give this six Pokéballs out of ten. While I wished the movie could have taken more advantage of the Pokémon and even with the overall mystery, it's clear that the audience for this movie are the fans in the first place. Director Rob Letterman had also directed Goosebumps and that too was meant for those who read the books. Pokémon: Detective Pikachu should only be watched by those who have a little nostalgia for the franchise. If so, then you gotta catch it all.",Pokémon Detective Pikachu
73,Anurag-Shetty,Nostalgia personified.,10,23 May 2019,"Pokemon Detective Pikachu tells the story of Tim Goodman(Justice Smith). The world has people that catch, train & do battle with Pokemon. In that world, a Pikachu who goes by the moniker Detective Pikachu(Ryan Reynolds), can talk to Tim & wants to solve a criminal conspiracy with Tim's help.Pokemon Detective Pikachu is a fantastic movie. Director Rob Letterman perfectly captures the legacy, adorableness & overall universal appeal of Pokemon. He does this, by staying away from the popular human characters of the Pokemon franchise like, Ash, Misty, Brock etc. Instead he gives us a fresh yet familiar adaptation of a lesser-known Nintendo video game series called, Detective Pikachu. The visual effects are awe-inspiring. All the Pokemon have been created flawlessly in live-action, using CGI. The Pokemon themselves, are the highlight of the film. Ryan Reynolds' vocal performance as Detective Pikachu, is spectacular. Justice Smith is outstanding as Tim Goodman. Smith ably carries the movie on his shoulders, alongside Reynolds. Ryan Reynolds & Justice Smith share this effortless & adorable chemistry, in all their interactions. Kathryn Newton is amazing as Lucy Stevens. Bill Nighy is brilliant as Howard Clifford. Chris Geere is superb as Roger Clifford. The supporting cast is great. Pokemon Detective Pikachu is a must watch for all Pokemon fans, families & everyone else. Go & catch 'em all!",Pokémon Detective Pikachu

76,markthomassintek,Gotta Catch Em All,7,21 May 2019,"REVIEW - Pokémon Detective PikachuI will confess here and now I have never seen the appeal in Pokémon, especially the world wide frenzy for Pokémon World, the APP where you walk around and find them.Pokémon has been a world-wide craze for so long now it was inevitable that at some point a film would be made and not just another animated feature length one, especially as the studios know it will bring in a lot of money of it was any good, or possibly not as the fan base is a loyal one.So again honestly I did put off reviewing this film.I will admit here and now for you all to read I was wrong to do so!As I've explained above I'm not a fan, never have been and never will be but I did actually enjoy this film. For the fan base they will love the Pokémon, getting excited and seeing each of them, for us none fans I must admit it is weird looking into eh Pokémon universe but you son get over the whole contrived nature of Pokémon when you get into the film.Sure it's simple to follow making it good for the small Pokémon fans but actually I enjoyed the simplicity of the film because sometimes you just want to turn your brain off and watch something that doesn't involve complicated plot twists and multiple story lines.When I heard Ryan Reynolds was doing the voice for the main Pokémon character Pikachu I did have my reservations but actually his dry humour is captured perfectly.The biggest gripe for me was why didn't the son recognise his father's voice? (no spoilers).Not my usual film but enjoyed it none the less, so yes take the kids and sit back and watch their faces light up as they see the Pokémon appear.Rating 7 out of 10",Pokémon Detective Pikachu

78,silvermistvio,Plot is too simple. Needs to improve more.,3,7 June 2019,"Pokémon Detective Pikachu film is one of those films that is very difficult to write review because I'm not a fan of Pokémon/Pikachu whatever. I haven't watched any kinds of this content. The reason why I've just watched this film because it's been on a local TV channel introducing that it's sort of popular. After I watched it, I don't have any feeling about for it. I felt like it's just a normal film.The plot is so simple and I've already seen this kind of things. But difference is that everyone has some animal along with them. Sometimes, I also wondered how it would be like to have an animal that can go wherever you go. If we could have like this, we wouldn't be so lonely, I guess. This film is some kind of what I thought.Although the plot is so simple, it's not that much boring. That being said, but it's not a perfect film. I kind of wanted to see something more than this. Some scenes are ordinary and some scenes are a bit funny. In some scenes, I can't catch some of the words especially some of the distorted voices. Maybe it's because I'm not a native speaker. So, my English listening skill is a bit low. I think they should make it clearer, hence, sound editing and mixing needs to improve more too.All in all, even though this film is so simple and I'm not fan of it, I think it's enjoyable for at least once.",Pokémon Detective Pikachu
79,kjproulx,A Solid Live-Action Adaptation,7,15 May 2019,"While today's generation may not realize this as much as those who grew up in the 1990s or early 2000s, Pokémon has been a worldwide phenomenon for quite some time. From portable video games to eventual platform games, the fad of Pokémon has never really died out. Becoming popular through card games, television shows, and movies, this is a brand that has many attached to it. Although I'm not a die-hard fan as some are, I have played the games, watched the shows and movies, and even played the card game as a kid. For these reasons alone, I may be slightly biased in this review, but I still believe many people can find enjoyment in Pokémon Detective Pikachu, and here's why.Following Tim Goodman (Justice Smith) after he has been given some gut-wrenching news, returns home, but doesn't expect to bump into a Pokémon known as Pikachu. These small creatures make very unique sounds and nobody can understand them, but for some reason, Tim can completely understand him. Pikachu, voiced by Ryan Reynolds, is easily the heart and soul of the film, as well as the comedic relief when times seem dour or hopeless. The journey these two take makes for a quite enjoyable little movie, even if the story itself seems a little been-there-done-that.The world itself that surrounds this story is what you should see this film for. From the very first frame, it feels like a realistic setting where these Pokémon would actually coexist with humans and other life. The world-building here is very well done and I truly hope that a sequel to this film gets the green light, because there is much more to explore. With that said, the premise of this movie is a simple detective story that ultimately may be predictable for some if you're trying to be one step ahead of the protagonists. In the end, the characters and settings themselves made for an enjoyable theatre experience and I was able to forgive the way the story played itself out.Now, this is just me choosing to nitpick the movie as a whole, but I truly don't believe they should have shown live-action Pokémon to average moviegoers with a movie called Pokémon Detective Pikachu. With so many classic storylines and characters to explore, I believe easing the audience in with a fun movie about Pokémon trainers would have been a great bridge to an eventual detective film like this. That has nothing to do with how I felt about this film in general, but it's just something I strongly feel should have been done first.Overall, Pokémon Detective Pikachu is the first film that was originally based on a video game series that seems to be pleasing the majority of audiences. For that alone, I believe it deserves a lot of praise. With a solid cast, some funny jokes, a world worth exploring, and even a pretty good score with subtle nods to past theme songs for fans of the television show, I feel that I can recommend this film to fans of Pokémon, as well as newcomers, as there are explanatory moments for those unfamiliar. I enjoyed watching this movie for what it was, which is more than I was expecting to say.",Pokémon Detective Pikachu
80,Movie-Misfit,Harmless Fun That Entertains!!,7,2 December 2019,"Detective Pikachu is definitely one of the better video game adaptations of the film world!While it may be predictable, the film manages to keep you watching thanks to the super cute Pikachu voiced by the fantastic Ryan Reynolds who's quick witted lines and passionate VO keeps you smiling right through.The other reason would be down to actually seeing the Pokemon themselves live on screen. They look amazing and I really hope they bring on a couple more Pokemon movies with the same standard!While not perfect nor overly gripping, Detective Pikachu still delivers and is quite an enjoyable film overall - no matter what age...",Pokémon Detective Pikachu
81,Darkside-Reviewer,The trailer was better,6,16 May 2019,I went into this movie with low expectations as the idea of a live action pokemon movie especially one centred around a spin off version of pikachu sounds dumb and not what anyone asked for in a pokemon movie so my honest opinion is the movie isn't bad it just isn't very good either all the best parts of the movie were in the trailer honestly you could re-edit the trailer with a few more scenes from the movie and you would have watched detective pikachu in under 3 minutes.The story is about a guy who's gets the news that his father has died he travels to the city his estranged father lives in and discovers a talking pikachu who was his father's pokemon the two form a partnership to discover what happened to his father what follows is about what you'd expect from a pokemon comedy movie with Mr mine jokes an underwhelming battle between Pikachu and a Charazard and other unfunny pokemon related jokes aswell as trying to jam a story into it that revolves around Mewtwo its predictable unfunny and a waste of a live action movie that could of been so much more than what amounts to a pokemon version of Ted.One thing I will praise the movie for is the animation it is very well done and blends the CGI and live action in a way most movies fail to do all the pokemon look great and follow there actual look in the games and anime which doesn't let fans down the acting is great especially for a movie so heavy on the CGI the actors and actress's really do a great job.My personal favourite character in this movie was Psyduck they made a not very powerful or particularly great Pokemon memorable and funny only using the word Psyduck it made me laugh and I just kept thinking how much he looked like Howard the duck in this movie.I'd recommend watching this movie when it comes out on DVD or with a group of friends just to laugh at it in theaters but there are much better movies out there in may 2019 worth watching in theatres.,Pokémon Detective Pikachu
82,Marwan-Bob,I watched it for the Nostalgia,5,27 July 2019,"I watched this Just for The Nostalgia, i was really a huge fan pf the Pokémon when i was a kid, i really liked the Ryan Reynolds's Version of Pikachu, But the film Not So much.",Pokémon Detective Pikachu
83,msbreviews,Rating: B-,6,9 May 2019,"If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog :)I'm going to write it straight away: I didn't enjoy Pokémon Detective Pikachu as much as I wanted to. In some ways, it disappointed me. Now, you're probably thinking ""oh, he's one of those people who never saw or played Pokémon in his life, and now he's going to destroy the film because he never understood it"". Not even close. There are always three groups of people when it comes to these famous franchises that have massive fandoms: the hardcore fans who follow the respective saga since it was created and never once stopped supporting it; the fans who like or even love it, but either skipped or gave up at a certain point in time; the non-fans who never really got into it and don't relate to any of what the previous two groups do.I belong to the second group. I'm a fan of Pokémon, but since the end of the last decade that I stopped playing its video games and watching any series or movies about it. Nevertheless, I'm always as fair and impartial as possible to films and to the people who gave their all to deliver a great story. For hardcore fans, this movie might have everything you've ever wished for. Even I was able to understand that some scenes are filled (and I mean literally the whole screen) with references and Easter Eggs that the most dedicated fans will absolutely love. These moments alone can make you enjoy this film way more than fans like me.However, we all know that while these sequences look fantastic and offer a lot of excitement, they are not enough to hold a narrative together or make it captivating. The Pokémons are gorgeous, and I found myself constantly in awe! Live-action will always have that crowd of haters that think the animated versions should stay animated, no matter what. There will always be people hating on these type of movies solely by the fact that they're live-action. Honestly, I try very hard, but I can't understand how people find an incredibly realistic Pikachu ugly or disgusting when it looks absolutely adorable and visually impressive. This will be such a long and exhausting debate throughout the 2020s, every time a live-action remake or adaptation is released, but I have faith people will come to accept it or even love it eventually.Detective Pikachu main issues are the screenplay and most of the characters, no doubt about it. I understand that the production team had to shift the primary focus to the VFX regarding the actual Pokémons since a lot of the viewers will buy the ticket only to watch a beautiful real world filled with them, but the two pillars of any film should never be kept aside for too long: story and characters. Justice Smith portrays the only human character that has a compelling backstory and a likable personality. Yes, Kathryn Newton (Lucy Stevens) delivers a good performance, and she also might interpret a character that a lot of people can relate to, but from the moment Lucy has more to do in the movie, it's like her development stagnated. However, Smith is brilliant as Tim and he showed a great range of emotions, making me not only laugh but also feel a bit emotional.Sadly, these two are the only human characters that aren't either a cliche villain who wants to rule the world or a paper-thin police or scientist who only serve as exposition devices. Honestly, this might be one of the most exposition-driven films of 2019. The amount of cheap and lazy information dumps spread across the runtime is too much to handle, especially when the same info is repeated several times. It unbalances the pacing and even the tone of the movie, making it dull during some periods. I'm rarely the guy who ""wants more action"", but Detective Pikachu really needed more thrilling moments, preferably involving Pokémon. Of the few action sequences, most are just our protagonists running from something and jumping from cliffs. Very rarely we see actual Pokémons doing anything until the last act.Rob Letterman shows that he has a lot of great qualities that a director should have, but he needs to work on his flaws and leave the screenwriting role to more experienced people. For such a mystery-driven story, the ""mystery"" part is pretty evident from the get-go, with a notable exception at the very end that I didn't saw coming and ended the film on a high note. Pikachu is beautifully voiced by Ryan Reynolds and if you were worried that his voice wouldn't blend with the yellow fellow, don't be. Pikachu is extremely funny and charming, carrying the whole show on its shoulders with a little help of Psyduck. Cubone and Ditto also have some great moments, but Mewtwo is a beauty to behold, as expected. Even though I'm not a hardcore fan, I felt the ""immersiveness"" of the incredible Pokémon world that Warner Bros. built and that's the best compliment I can give: I felt like I was in a real Pokémon universe.All in all, Pokémon Detective Pikachu is fine. For hardcore fans, it might be everything you've ever wished for, but for fans of the 2000s Pokémon, who stopped following the franchise after the beginning of the new decade, the numerous Easter Eggs and references might not be enough to overcome the undeniable narrative issues. Justice Smith delivers an outstanding performance, and Ryan Reynolds nails Pikachu's voice, being extremely funny and unbelievably adorable. The CGI is ground-breaking, making the Pokémons astonishingly realistic and their world remarkably immersive. However, even if the movie ends with a terrific touch, the shallow characters, the heavy exposition dumps, and the not-that-mysterious mystery bring the pacing down and turn this live-action adaptation into just an okay one.PS: regarding the curse of the video games cinematic adaptations, I already believe that Tomb Raider broke it with a good margin, but both Warcraft and Pokémon Detective Pikachu managed to just scratch the positive side of my reviews. You're on the right track, but step up Hollywood!",Pokémon Detective Pikachu
84,SoumikBanerjee25,One of the better Adaptation of An Anime!,7,6 August 2019,"When I was just 4 years old, Pokemon was a huge part of my life! It was my first ever introduction to the Anime universe. Although I may have forgotten a lot of it after these so many years ; this movie brought back nostalgic memories from the childhood! It now feels strange to know How real crazy I was about these fantasy creatures. Well that's enough about the past, let's focus on the movie now. Shall we?The film started on a fast note, the first thing That I noticed was the CGI! It looked real good! We got introduced to lot of Pokemon in the first half ; in the meantime the human characters came one by one. Apart from the main Lead Tim (Justice Smith) ; the other human characters looked flat and underdeveloped! Though the characterisation of the Pokemon characters gone down really well! Specially with Pikachu (Ryan Reynolds did An amazing job with the voice) and Mewtwo! We could connect more to those Pokemon rather than the other humans in this film. Now that's not a bad thing in a way but human characters could have played a lot more importance into the plot. The sound score is soothing and energetic at the same time and knows really well which scene demands which kind of tempo! Another impressive thing they have done is The explanatory of the creatures. You don't necessarily have to be a fan of the Pokemon to understand the movie! They explained all the basic components and their abilities in a easy & understandable way.Overall it's a decent adaptation of the Anime. You could surely watch it ; if you have been a fan of Pokemon or want to know about them! Could have been a lot better but it is what it is. Children will love it, so try to bring them along.",Pokémon Detective Pikachu

Ryan Reynolds' shoulders must be hurting bad, from carrying this entire movie for 1hr40mins. Why didn't they cast some recognizable faces opposite Reynolds? It would have boosted sales AND increased the quality of the acting in the movie. Anyway... apart from the bad casting, this movie ISN'T a movie about Pokemon... it's a movie about a boy who is searching for his father... so why did they include the word ""Pokemon"" in the title of the film then? This is clickbait at its best! There's only 2 Pokemon battles in the ENTIRE MOVIE and once is a Pokeball thrown at a Pokemon... Where's the battles?! Where's the capturing?! Where's the Pokemon center, with that iconic song we all know and love?! Where's nurse Joy and officer Jenny?! Where's professor Oak?! Where's the Pokemon Gyms?!

87,Min111,Pikachu is a detective,5,9 August 2020,"It's a movie where you get to see many of your favourite Pokémon. You get to see the best of all the Pokémon named Mewtwo. He was amazing! So strong and powerful. I like the way it looks. I actually think he's better than Arceus. It's clear that Mewtwo and Mew are the strongest Pokémon from the first generation. I still think they are the strongest of all the generations despite what the stats tell you. Pokémon is more than just stats. Luckily, you don't get to see Arceus. See, the producers don't even like him otherwise he would've been in the movie. I like to see Arceus and Mewtwo fight. I'm sure Mewtwo would win. There are Pokémon other than from the Kanto region in the movie. There was Greninja who happens to be a generation six Pokémon. Arceus is from generation four. Charizard with his flamethrower was excellent. He happens to be one of my favourite Pokémon. He's also very strong and powerful. The one I want to talk about is Pikachu. He was so cool. He looks better in the movie than in the anime. I like the cap he wears - he looks so cute. He's a detective. The best thing is Pikachu is able to talk, and it was nice hearing him speak. He's funny. He'll make you laugh. The movie is about him. Another Pokémon that can talk in Pokémon Detective Pikachu is Mewtwo which is of no surprise. Everyone knows Mewtwo can talk. We saw him talk in Pokémon: The First Movie. There's actually a sequel to that movie called Pokemon: Mewtwo Returns. It's worth checking out. Most people have forgotten about that movie - I can tell you that. If you liked Pokémon: Detective Pikachu, you'll also like Mewtwo Returns. I think another thing the producers missed out on is Meowth and Slowking. It would've great had those two talked in the movie. Everyone knows Meowth can talk. Slowking talked in Pokémon The Movie 2000. Meowth could've been Pikachu's partner in the movie. It would've worked. Pikachu, though, was the star of the movie. He made the movie good to watch. His background was so interesting. He's a detective. The most important thing about the movie, or that everyone only cares about is that the most 'popular' Pokémon, Pikachu, can talk. You get to hear his voice only in this movie. Let's not forget all the other Pokémon that appeared in the background during this movie. It was nice to see them. Some of them should've had more of a role or screen time. Pokémon Detective Pikachu is more of a comedy movie than an action movie. A fun movie.",Pokémon Detective Pikachu
88,mfellipecampos,Very good,8,22 November 2019,"Pokémon: Detective Pikachu (in Brazil and Portugal, Pokémon: Detetive Pikachu) is a Japanese-American fantasy movie produced by Legendary Entertainment, The Pokémon Company, Toho and Warner Bros. Pictures, based on the media franchise ""Pokémon"" by Satoshi Tajiri, Ken Sugimori, Game Freak and Nintendo. The film is directed by Rob Letterman, and stars Ryan Reynolds, Justice Smith, Kathryn Newton, Ken Watanabe, Rita Ora. The movie was released on May 3 in Japan, May 9 in Brazil and Portugal, and May 10, 2019 in the United States. In the Pokémon universe, Tim Goodman is a former Pokémon Trainer and the son of prominent Ryme City detective Harry Goodman, invited by his father to work at the police station. Tim arrives in Ryme City and meets Detective Yoshida, a friend of Harry's, and learns that shortly after sending the train ticket to get to town, his father had mysteriously disappeared while working on a case. Staying at his father's house until Harry is found, Tim is surprised to find a ""talking"" Pikachu (in fact only Tim can understand him). However, Pikachu is suffering from a serious case of amnesia, and the two must work together to find out what happened to Harry. While searching for clues around the city, they found a reporter named Lucy Stevens, who is also trying to find out what happened to Harry. Their clues lead to an underground fighting ring, accompanied by a man named Sebastian, owner of a Charizard, a Mr. Mime who may know some information they need, and a plot that threatens the Pokémon universe. Based on the hormone video game, Detective Pikachu is a reinvention of the canonical universe from the politically correct of today, causing the battles between the monsters and their trainers to be abolished at least in Rime City, the model city where is situated is history. In a world where Pokémon and humans live in harmony, a test is put to the test when a detective mysteriously dies, leaving behind his investigative mate, none other than Pikachu. Out of memory and next to his partner's son, the little yellow electric mouse needs to find out what really happened. Too many Pokémon are shown in the movie, even though very few actually have a stake in the story. Does not matter! The voice actor who doubles Pikachu Philippe Maia and I know his work and brought a voice to this carioca-style pokémon, even actor Ryan Reynolds didn't exactly follow the original script .. It doesn't matter! Still, I really liked Philippe's voice acting sent very well. Pokémon are quite cute, created exactly what the fans wanted an indirect Sonic movie. My movie rating is 8.0.Movie watched on May 16, 2019",Pokémon Detective Pikachu
89,MrDHWong,A mostly successful western live action adaptation of the popular video game series,7,9 May 2019,"Pokémon Detective Pikachu is a mystery film based on the Pokémon franchise directed by Rob Letterman (Goosebumps, Gulliver's Travels). Starring Ryan Reynolds and Justice Smith, it is a mostly successful western live action adaptation of the popular video game series that is about on par with several online fan films.After his detective father goes missing in a car accident, former Pokémon trainer Tim Goodman (Justice Smith) travels to Ryme City, a bustling metropolis where humans and Pokémon live alongside each other, to look for him. Upon arriving at his father's old apartment, Tim is surprised to find a Pikachu (voiced by Ryan Reynolds) drinking coffee, rummaging through the desks, and most shocking of all, speaking to him in plain English! Tim later learns that this Pikachu once belonged to his father and the two decide to work together to solve the mystery of his whereabouts.Even though film adaptations of video games are often of poor quality, Pokémon Detective Pikachu manages to transcend this by staying respectful to its source material and never once losing sight of what made the series a worldwide phenomenon in the first place. Perhaps best of all, unlike the anime films, this one actually gives an explanation as to what Pokémon actually are, which broadens the overall appeal to franchise newcomers. The film exudes charm and wonderment, thanks to the convincing CGI used to bring the Pokémon to life on the big screen, particularly that of the adorable fluffy Pikachu. Despite this, the film could have done a much better job with its world building. The audience is only offered but a glimpse of the unique technology and set design, which is not nearly enough to take in the atmosphere of these Pokémon inhabited environments. Hopefully we will see more of this if a sequel is ever greenlit. Justice Smith does a reasonable job as the film's protagonist, even if he feels like a bit of a blank slate at times, but of course it is Ryan Reynolds as the voice of Pikachu who shines the most, injecting much of his trademark wit and humour into his performance, almost like a kid-friendly version of Deadpool. While this may not be a must-see on the big screen for any Pokémon novices, this is certainly worth checking out at cinemas for any longtime fans.I rate it 7/10",Pokémon Detective Pikachu
90,cardsrock,Solid entertainment,7,15 May 2019,I can say pretty confidently that this is the best video game adaptation to ever hit the big screen. Ryan Reynolds as Detective Pikachu carries this movie. He manages to pull off hilarious and adorable at the same time. All of the Pokemon are utilized brilliantly and you feel instantly at home in this bizarre world. Where the film falters a bit is with its human characters and story. The lead actor is painfully bad and the plotline is fairly forgettable. Detective Pikachu is a solid start for this franchise though and I'm excited to see where this universe will go in the future.,Pokémon Detective Pikachu
91,CANpatbuck3664,Beautifully Animated with a Really Funny Performance From Reynolds,8,19 May 2019,"I wasn't very interested when I heard about the premise of this movie, I had grown up during when Pokemon became a worldwide phenomenon but it was more a pleasant memory from my childhood then something I still had on the brain. But I saw the trailer and the part of the movie that caught my eye was the design and animation of the Pokemon. They really looked like if you had to transport the idea of Pokemon into the modern world and I was just as impressed in the movie. The animation is fantastic, there were points where my jaw dropped (there's a Pokemon battle in the middle that was better than I could have imagined it would be). Each character is unique enough to distinguish, they do a good job of bringing their characteristics to the forefront and there wasn't a time where I wasn't engaged. There were points where just the amount of work and how well it was done when it was put on the screen was amazing (I was in awe at points, it felt like being transported into my childhood daydreams). Whoever did the design and the CGI animators deserve a ton of credit, its the highlight of the movie and if you're a fan of this property, you'll be blown away.While Pikachu has the rougher edges of the film noir filed off, it is a film noir story. My description of the plot of the movie would be ""good enough."" The setup as a mystery is pretty good, they give Tim a surprising amount of development with the death of his father, the strained relationship he had with him before the accident, and his dissatisfaction with his life in general. So rounding the 1/3 mark of the movie, I was also impressed with the construction of the plot. They do a solid job of still telling a detective story while not pushing the envelope too far. There's a good scene of interrogating an informant, they infiltrate an underground organization etc. and they largely pulled it off. They had yet to run out of creative ways to integrate those elements. But on the other side of the coin, I will concede that when we go into the final act, the creativity starts to sputter and eventually it runs out of gas. The ending isn't terrible but its the weak point for sure. It didn't ruin the movie but I shrugged my shoulders and had to concentrate on the action.The main character of Tim Goodman is played by Justice Smith who you might recognize from Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom. This is a big improvement, I couldn't stand him in that movie but he did a good job with the shifting tones and playing the straight man next to Reynolds eventually. I hope he's able to build off this and get more work. Reynolds is a riot as Pikachu, you can tell he's working on the fly with most of his material but his delivery makes the movie. I don't think this would have worked as well with another actor in that role, it was great casting. Kathryn Newton and Ken Watanabe are both solid in their respective roles, neither is given a lot of depth (which is too bad) but they do what they can. It was nice to see Karan Soni in a small role in the beginning and while I always get a kick out of seeing Bill Nighy, his casting might tip where the mystery is going because of the type of role he usually plays.Detective Pikachu isn't a flawless movie but it reminds me a lot of Goosebumps, another underrated Rob Letterman movie that was surprisingly successful. Much like Goosebumps, Detective Pikachu builds this unique and fun world, features a funny and surprisingly solid lead performance (I'm talking about Reynolds, Smith is good but Pikachu steals the movie) and while there are small hangups (highs and lows in the plot, meh ending, a couple of characters being derivative) this is a much better execution than I was expecting. The critical reception for this has been a collective shrug but this is one of the few times I want to point the finger at them and ask ""What were you really expecting?"" I liked this movie a lot despite some minor criticisms and my actual rating for this is 8.5/10. I can't go to 9 though, if the material had a couple more winks and nods to the adult audience (the movie is very kid-friendly) e.g. the Lego Movie, I would bump it up. I saw this with my best friend and we both left the theatre with huge grins on our faces. But if you or your kids love Pokemon or would like a family friendly take on film noir with some fantastical elements, don't hesitate to see this in theatres.",Pokémon Detective Pikachu

The film fails to deeply engage with audiences and some of the facts laid in by the plot is too much to understand as I'm not a Pokemon player. The visual effects were very good. There was some really good twists like the powerful Pokemon is not evil but good and some pretty bad predictable ones like the bad guy. The bad guy twist also felt like same as The Wolverine's. The Pikachu was so cute and entertaining. Ryan Reynolds did a very good job there. Justice Smith was just okay.

In what I can only describe as ""so cute you want to hug the screen"" Justice Smith plays the human to Pikachu. Not being a fan of Pokemon (too old) I was surprised how adult this film actually is. The story is of Smith who goes back to the city of Ryme to close out his late father's affairs only to discover that he may not even be dead. The plot gets convoluted so here's the rundown on it...yes...it's pretty paint-by-numbers detective story but with cuddly icons that inhabit human world. The bad guy is going to be corporate. Because...they just are. And touching scenes will come about with man and pokemon. So what's left? A pretty darn good tale of a young man who searches for closure for an absent dad. Not bad for a kids tale.
Fun stuff throughout. But...sometimes Pikachu's/Ryan Reynolds one liners get corny...still works for me.",Pokémon Detective Pikachu

But when I watched the film it was pretty well done, the movie was really good and I enjoyed it. Ryan Reynolds is great, justice Smith keeps proving to us all that he is a great actor and good performance by bill nighy. The CGI was perfect for the pokemon characters.

102,PyroSikTh,Bad Acting Doesn't Overshadow the Novelty of Pokemon Come to Life,7,14 May 2019,"I said this when it was first announced, and I'll say it again now; Detective Pikachu was a terrible idea for the first live action Pokemon movie. And I still kind of stand by that. It was a terrible idea that should never have gotten passed the pitch. And yet sometimes the worst ideas make for the most entertaining movies. How they managed to pull this off is beyond me. Honestly if it wasn't for that first trailer making me do a complete one-eighty, I wouldn't have even bothered to see this movie. Instead I trudged through fever and flu to make sure I didn't miss it. In fact if anything, my opinion did such a hard reversal from that first trailer that I actually kind of find myself underwhelmed with the final product.Detective Pikachu opens with Mewtwo in a container, a car speeding off before being taken off the road, and a couple of explosions. So far so good. I was instantly transported back to Mewtwo Strikes Back, which contains, to this day, the most heartbreaking moment of any movie ever made. Bold stance. I stand by it. But seriously, I loved that movie twenty years ago, and I still love it today, so this did give me hope that we'd be sort of getting a live action version of that movie and my inner nine-year old almost yelped. In truth Detective Pikachu never gets as dark or emotional as Mewtwo Strikes Back did, and to be honest I knew that was a pipedream. Instead Detective Pikachu, quite rightly so, goes for the more colourful, lighthearted, and fantastical elements of Pokemon mythos.From there we cut to Tim and one of his friends spending quality time together in a field, where there's a Cubone crying and screaming to himself. This is our first, and really only hint of Pokemon training. Tim reluctantly attempts to catch the Cubone and fails. The only other time we get to see some of the traditional Pokemon we all know and love is in a little infomercial while Tim's on the train, explaining what Pokemon training is, and about the battles trainers fight in, which is useful exposition for anyone living under a rock, but completely nonsensical to those who actually live in that universe.While I'm on this point, I'll start my criticisms. The movie is full of useless exposition. Credit where credit is due, it could have been so much worse, and they left more up to the audience than I honestly expected. Even I found myself a little lost on technicalities at times. I was a big fan of the whole Pokemon thing as a kid, dropped off around Ruby/Sapphire (I was ""too old"" I told myself, pfft), but jumped back in with Diamond/Pearl, HeartGold/SoulSilver, and Black/White, only to lose interest again at that point. I played Pokemon Go! for a couple of months, and we got halfway through the Orange Islands arc of the anime, before giving up on that as well, so for me Pokemon is very much a love-hate franchise. As such there were a number of Pokemon in this movie that I had no knowledge of whatsoever. The Greninjas in particular have a pretty crucial role, but I know nothing of them, their type, their abilities, where they'd be found, etc. And that wasn't something that was explained, so I know just as much about Greninja as I did before watching the movie. But there were other moments that were way over-explained. The most obvious things are pointed out in cheesy expositional lines. Like if you can trust us to know the intricacies of a Pokemon universe, I think we're smart enough to know that the Pikachu we're looking at is our main character. That doesn't need to be pointed out.Furthermore the acting is garbage, like just flat-out bad. Justice Smith is average at best, Kathryn Newton was cringeworthy with almost every line, and even seasoned veterans like Bill Nighy and Ken Watanabe seemed to struggle with the dialogue. The only saving grace was Ryan Reynolds himself. While his voice is a weird fit for a cute and fluffy Pikachu, his natural personality was perfect for the role, his delivery of his lines was spot-on, and there is an actual reason why it's him voicing Pikachu in particular, but that's spoiler territory.But you want to hear the good things too, right? The visuals are a big plus. A huge plus. The Pokemon in this movie simply look spectacular. They've been given new life by CGI, and yet remain cartoony enough to still be recognisable, like the perfect compromise between what we know and love, and the full-blown terrors they would actually be if they were real, so massive kudos for that. Each and every one is afforded a brilliant attention to detail, and the techniques used to bring them to life are as diverse as the Pokemon themselves. It goes without saying, but Pikachu is the star of the movie visually. He's so fluffy and cute I just wanted to snuggle my face into him, before remembering that pikachu aren't real. But the attention to detail when they come out of a river and his fur has turned soggy and matted made me believe he was real for a split second. But it's not just the fur either, obviously not every Pokemon is going to be furry, some are scaly, some have smooth skin, some almost look unnatural like Mewtwo and Mr. Mime. Even Ditto features in all his translucent jelly-ness.But even the settings were brought to life really well. Ryme City looks so unlike any real city, and yet looks entirely how you'd imagine a city in the Pokemon universe to look. Every frame is filled with colour and neon lights, and every building is sleek and futuristic without looking overly sci-fi. The best way I can describe it is if American cities were designed by Japanese architects. Even the small town that Tim lives in at the beginning of the movie looks oddly fantastical, like it's been cut straight out of the games, and yet looks real and lived-in all the same. When balancing the visual merits of the Pokemon universe with live action, this film absolutely nails it in every regard. And honestly that's all I've ever wanted to see for the last twenty years.The story itself is surprisingly good as well. I mean it's no Mewtwo Strikes Back, but if you took out the Pokemon, it would still be a legitimate mystery story. There's so many twists and turns, and new revelations all the time as they dig deeper and deeper into the truth. The third act is just about a twist a minute, and I didn't see any of them coming despite how obvious they seem in retrospect. While the dialogue could've done with a bit more polishing, I at least have to commend the writers for giving a Pokemon movie an actually decent story. The music by Henry Jackman is also pretty good too. I'm not sure it's quite good enough to listen to by itself, but it's diverse enough, ranging from typical orchestral score to dubstep, and the video game synths of ""Ryme City"" and ""Epiphany"" really gave the soundtrack its own identity, and harkened back to the games quite well.In all Detective Pikachu isn't quite as great as I was hoping. At the end of the day it comes across as a fairly generic family film, eschewing away from the seriousness and darkness that could've stepped it up a level (beyond that Mr. Mime interrogation, of course). There's a handful of plot holes and the dialogue is questionable, but the story we got was surprisingly enthralling and kept me guessing to the end. The comedy wasn't quite as laugh-out-loud as I was expecting from a talking Pikachu voiced by Ryan Reynolds, but there were certainly flashes of greatness in there, and his sad rendition of the original theme was both heartbreaking and hilarious all at once. I give Detective Pikachu an enjoyable and visually extravagant, but flawed 7/10.",Pokémon Detective Pikachu
103,sweidman-28016,Entertaining Watch,6,16 May 2019,"Pokémon Detective Pikachu Review:Ace detective Harry Goodman goes mysteriously missing, prompting his 21-year-old son, Tim, to find out what happened. Aiding in the investigation is Harry's former Pokémon partner, wise-cracking, adorable super-sleuth Detective Pikachu. Finding that they are uniquely equipped to work together, as Tim is the only human who can talk to Pikachu, they join forces to unravel the tangled mystery. I had no clue if I was going to like this or not. The trailer made it look cute but the plot seemed like it wouldn't really work. The only way I can describe the quality is this is what you'd expect for a live action Pokémon movie. It was enjoyable to watch I will say. Seeing all the Pokémon interacting with the world was interesting and cool to me. It's basically what I wanted Pokémon Go to be like. I will say though it wasn't anything amazing. The plot was generic, as expected, and pretty predictable. I wouldn't say that's an entirely bad thing since I expected that. There were plot holes and stuff that didn't make sense through (for some reason driving on a given side of the road was different in almost ever shot). But it was fine in all. My main problem would be with the characters. There wasn't a single character that I cared about. They tried to develop to make the audience feel for, especially Tim, but it failed to work. Tim is someone we're supposed to feel for and feel the tragedy, but it wasn't there. The first 20 minutes were about him yet I felt nothing. It's not Justice Smith's fault, it's the way the script writes the characters. The best part of the whole movie has to be Ryan Reynolds as Pikachu. His personality fit the character very well and made for an enjoyable time. The mixture of humor, seriousness, and adorableness was perfect. There's a girl who shows up, Lucy Stevens, and she's supposed to be a reporter. I didn't feel anything for her at all. It felt like an annoying girl character from the games, but it didn't work at all. Just the characters and the predictable plot were my main problems. Now for the technical aspects. For the visual effects they did as well as they could do making the Pokémon feel real, but it wasn't that great. Rhyme City looked cool however. I loved the relationship between the humans and Pokémon. The score was cool because it incorporated the original melodies from the games and show. I liked that a lot. This movie just brought back a lot of nostalgia which made me enjoy it. Probably on second watch that might go away. It's an entertaining movie with a subpar plot and bad characters. It's the way they make it fun that makes for an enjoyable watch. I think fans of the games and show will like it. I would recommend it if you're into Pokémon or something similar.My Grade: C+",Pokémon Detective Pikachu

105,ethanbresnett,A bit of a dud unfortunately,6,28 May 2020,"Growing up I spent hundreds upon hundreds of hours on Pokemon games, collecting cards and watching cartoons. With this in mind and my rose tinted spectacles on, I settled down to watch Detective Pikachu. I was very scared twenty minutes in that this film was going to be an absolute disaster, with no love for our protagonist Tim, some dodgy special effects, and a story that was full of clichés up to this point. Thankfully Ryan Reynolds came along and lit up the film (well, his voice did at least).I can only assume that Reynolds has a large part to play in crafting the script when it came down to his lines. It was ten times sharper than the rest of the script and had some uncanny lines that wouldn't have felt out of place coming out of Deadpool's mouth. There was a good range of humour, from low hanging fruit to more intelligent and thinly veiled adult jokes at times. Enough to keep me entertained for sure.There were also some brilliantly crafted scenes with the interrogation of a Mr Mime being a standout. It's a shame really as scenes like this show what the film could have been. There's so much material to go for in the Pokemon universe and I can't help but feel a few opportunities were missed.Speaking of missed opportunities I felt that the plot was a little thin. Considering how short of a movie it is there was a fair bit of faff in places and I think the reveal and resolution in the third act came and went a bit too quickly. There were far too many cliches and none of the characters (bar Pikachu of course) were of much interest.If you can't tell your Charmanders from your Charizards this movie may not be for you, but if you're a Pokemon fan it is probably worth a watch for the nostalgia alone.",Pokémon Detective Pikachu

I am and always have been a pokemon fan for as long as I can remember, so i knew going into this i was going to love it. Ryan Reynolds plays the part of Pikachu extraordinarily well and its absolutely miraculous. The story without spoiling anything flows the character of Tim Goodman (Justice Smith) in search for his apparent dead father and in this tale it is executed perfectly, loads of appearances of pokemon we've all grown to love.This was phenomenal, I wasnt sure if it would be good coming out in the year of remakes but I let my guard down as its pokemon and my childhood burst out! Everything down the last detail was spot on, the camera angles were so intense and they worked like a charm, the characters don't look too animated to be in the same universe as a human which was a little worry but it turned into anything but. I thoroughly felt entertained the whole way through, such a performance.An intriguing tale which we can call an addition to the Pokefamily, was truly a monumental experience that I wont forget in a hurry, im suprised I didnt get round to watching this sooner, I hope my review has helped you make a choice about watching this incredible film, it's definately worth the watch, i loved every minute of it, not only is it very funny but it also has you feeling for the characters at certain aspects of it, it's magnificent with a capital M and I am beyond belief at how magnificent it truly was.Highly recommend this, you won't be disappointed by this hilarious story, i know I wasn't, I was in stitches the whole way through, Ryan Reynolds' take on the character of Pikachu was such a hysterical peformance which I think was very marvelousto witness.",Pokémon Detective Pikachu

108,Magow-Intermean,Pokémon Detective Pikachu Review,7,4 May 2019,"Tim (Justice Smith) may be the only person in the world who doesn't love Pokémon; in fact, he rejects them. When he learns that his detective dad was killed in a suspicious crash, he's forced to join forces with Pokémon Pikachu (Ryan Reynolds), the only creature who can help him crack the case.For those who have somehow missed out on the games, cartoons, trading cards, beach towels etc, Pokémon are (usually cute) creatures that wander around with their owners, who sometimes keep them in balls, which they throw at them to catch them (don't worry, Pokémon are okay with this). They have special powers and can be forced to battle each other (they're okay with that too). The only thing they can say is their own names, like Groot (Groot is not a Pokémon, but could be). They come in unending variety and people collect them. This probably hasn't helped. All you really need to know to enjoy, if not entirely understand, Pokémon Detective Pikachu is that they're cartoony sidekicks, and one of them sounds like Ryan Reynolds doing a less saucy, equally sassy version of Deadpool.This is not the first Pokémon film to be released - there are already 19 animated movies - but it's the first one made for uninitiated audiences. It aims to put everyone on the same page by opening with a brand-new character. Tim, played with awkward charm by Justice Smith, is a 21-year-old insurance drone who has lost both his parents. His mother died when he was very young and, he learns at the film's outset, his detective father was killed in a suspicious accident. The only thing that survived was his father's Pokémon assistant, Pikachu, who has lost his memory but wants Tim to help him find out what caused his dad's accident. Bizarrely, Tim can understand everything Pikachu says (in the voice of Ryan Reynolds), even though Pokémon can't speak. Tim overcomes his dislike of Pokémon, the reasons for which become clear later, to join Pikachu on his mission.As a buddy comedy it's heaps of fun.
In terms of plotting, Detective Pikachu is pretty shoddy. It doesn't very clearly establish the rules of Pokémon in the human world (if you don't know your Mewtwo from your Mew, then good luck with the finer details) and the storytelling is so ham-fisted that approximately every 20 minutes there will be a long dialogue scene in which a character will monologue about what's happening and what will happen next. However, as a buddy comedy it is heaps of fun.Whoever decided that the film needed Ryan Reynolds deserves an enormous pay rise. His voice coming out of a little fluffy hamster-y thing is innately amusing, but his lines are also sharp, silly and knowing. The odd-couple riffing between him and Smith produces some scenes of surreal comic excellence - especially one in which they interrogate a mime Pokémon, which has a joltingly dark punchline. It bears some comparison with The Lego Movie. While it's not the work of genius that is, it finds success in the same approach: instead of being drily reverent to the multi-billion dollar product that inspired it, it's confident that it's so beloved that it can make relentless, affectionate fun of it, with the help of a small, yellow, snarky.It's impossible to overstate how much this film owes to Ryan Reynolds. Even if you don't understand Pikachu's world, everyone can understand a great joke superbly delivered.",Pokémon Detective Pikachu

111,jamiedarlow-37510,'PSYDUCK!!',6,30 March 2020,"A pretty sweet cinematic outing for Pokemon and another reason why Ryan Reynolds is the man! Taking place in a world where Pokemon and humans co-exist, Tim (Justice Smith) is a young man investigating his father's disappearance and stumbles upon a Detective Pikachu who joins him in his quest. Director Rob Letterman (Monsters Vs Aliens, Shark Tale) co-writes the screenplay with three other writers and it just about manages to stay together with all the cooks creating the broth although there are times when the plot gets a bit too twisty and turny for its own good and it could've done with focusing more on the light comic side than the more dramatic aspect of the story. This is no bash against the filmmakers as there is clearly passion and love put into the project and genuine care shown for its characters; performances are good and it is really funny in places. Although the drama gives a more emotional pathos to the film, it's the comedy that makes the film really shine! It's mainly worth seeing for Reynolds as Pikachu as it is a really awesome idea executed perfectly and the animation for him is brilliant! The inclusion of other Pokemon such as Psyduck is a great move and putting him in a perilous situation is worth the ticket price alone. Kids will love it and old school Pokemon fans will definately get a kick out of it",Pokémon Detective Pikachu
112,shawneofthedead,"Flawed as it is, this thoughtful re-imagining of the Pokémon franchise is fun, silly and charming in lots of the right ways.",7,10 May 2019,"The Low-Down: There really is no better time for Hollywood to release its first live-action Pokémon movie. Generations of children - who are now adults with spending power - have grown up dreaming of becoming Pokémon trainers. Since their creation in the mid-1990s, the (mostly) adorable creatures known as Pokémon ('pocket monsters') have captured hearts and imaginations all over the world - through video-games, animated television shows, movies and more. The advent of Pokémon Go in 2016 has taken the franchise into the global mainstream, boosting its name recognition even among those who couldn't have differentiated between a Bulbasaur and a Charmander just a few years ago. Fortunately, Detective Pikachu doesn't come across as just a cynical cash-grab - it will delight its devoted fan base, but is also smart and charming enough to appeal to a wider audience.The Story: Tim Goodman (Justice Smith) has lived a life as far away from his childhood dream of becoming a Pokémon trainer as you can get. Working quietly in the insurance industry, he refuses to even choose a Pokémon as his companion. One day, he receives a fateful call that brings him to Ryme City: a metropolis created by brilliant industrialist Howard Clifford (Bill Nighy), where humans and Pokémon live and work in harmony. Tim's estranged father has gone missing, and the only clue he has left behind is Detective Pikachu (Ryan Reynolds) - whose clever insights and snarky observations can only be understood by Tim.The Good: Detective Pikachu is a remarkably canny adaptation of Pokémon lore and legend. Fans will have a ton of fun (and might need multiple viewings) to spot all the Pokémon wandering in and out of frame - from dozing Slakoths to swooping Pidgeots, grieving Cubones and beyond. You might find yourself experiencing a sense of visceral joy at seeing these critters come to life, quite literally, and interact with actual human beings - not just on the page, or via pixels. Happily, though, the film doesn't simply rely on fan service and affection to power through. There's a welcome wit and warmth to much of its writing that's impossible to resist, especially when it comes to the film's titular electric-yellow hero - an adorable ball of energy that literally (and metaphorically) lights up the screen.The Not-So-Good: If you're a Pokémon neophyte, you might find yourself quite confused by audience reactions to Detective Pikachu, which don't always match what's happening on screen. You'll still be able to follow the narrative fairly easily, but you'll be lost when audience members freak out at the many Easter eggs and callbacks to decades of Pokémon canon. The film's plotting also loses its footing towards the end, when the motivations of its main antagonist and the truth about Tim's mysterious connection with Detective Pikachu become clear. At this point, it feels as if director Rob Letterman and his screenwriting team came up with the ending they wanted, and then reverse-engineered the rest of the film to make it work.MVP (Most Valuable Pokémon): The answer is obviously Pikachu - a blend of brilliant character design and charismatic voice/facial-capture work by Reynolds. But one of the greatest joys of Detective Pikachu is that it doesn't simply provide a showcase for Pikachu, already one of the most beloved of all Pokémon. Psyduck - a frazzled duck perpetually on the verge of combusting from stress - walks a fine line between hilarious and helpful. Even Mr. Mime, easily one of the weirdest and creepiest Pokémon ever created, gets a moment to shine - and in the kind of scene that's so blissfully weird and silly that you can't help but appreciate what the filmmakers are trying to do, even if they don't always succeed.Recommended? Yes. Detective Pikachu could have raked in the cash through brand loyalty alone. But the film is evidently the product of a great deal of love and care. Flawed as it is, this thoughtful re-imagining of the Pokémon franchise is fun, silly and charming in lots of the right ways.",Pokémon Detective Pikachu
113,DeBBss,Great Act 1... Then It All Falls Apart,6,26 May 2020,"Pokemon Detective Pikachu could've been a great movie to watch; it had so much potential. I really wanted to like Pokemon Detective Pickachu solely because of the first act. The first act set up everything so well, but they just completely bombed the next acts. It felt as if a new writer was doing the screenplay after act one, because act one set up all the characters and gave exposition perfectly. If Pokemon Detective Pikachu was more consistent with the screenplay, then it could've been really good.The villain gets introduced in the second act, by bringing in Bill Nighy's character, Howard Clifford. The problem is that Howard Clifford was such an obvious bad guy that when you saw him, you immediately knew he was going to be a surprise villain. Also, Howard Clifford never gave a reason why he wanted to turn the people and their Pokemon into one being; he did it just because his character had to do it. Because of Howard Clifford being written so horribly, the plot was so predictable that it hurts. The good thing is that the writers know how to write a good dysfunctional family relationship; this made Tim Goodman and his father's relationship realistic.I loved Ryan Reynolds' performance as Detective Pickachu. Ryan Reynolds is great in comedies because he's simply funny. I seriously don't believe that any other actor can do a performance that is on the same level as Reynolds'. But besides from Reynolds' performance, everyone else did an average job. Justice Smith did an okay job, but when Justice Smith and Ryan Reynolds acted together, Justice Smith doesn't look good at all.The most impressive part about Pokemon Detective Pikachu is the CGI. To bring in all of these anime Pokemon into live action would look weird if done wrong, but there was a good mixture of realism and anime in all of the Pokemon. I can really appreciate the VFX artists after Pokemon Detective Pickachu.Pokemon Detective Pickachu had such a great act one that it overshadowed everything else. It's upsetting because I wanted to like this movie, but the issues are too glaring. It's way too predictable and stereotypical that I can't give it a rating higher than a six.",Pokémon Detective Pikachu

I found the last act of the movie very enjoyable, with some great special effects and great action scenes. The first act felt like an okay setup, the 2nd was pretty slow for me, but overall I found the movie enjoyable an if you are a Pokemon fan there are many references and easter eggs that you will enjoy.",Pokémon Detective Pikachu
115,x_manicure_x,Holds itself back,5,14 August 2021,"I was expecting the worst, but I have to say this movie was actually more than decent. It feels like the people behind it are just the same as we are: kids who used to love Pokémon in the '90s and that are paying their tribute to the franchise. The structure and overall tone remind me of those kids-adventure movies we used to watch in elementary and junior high. I am pretty sure that I would have loved this just if I were twelve.Its biggest flaw is the lackluster humor. I guess Pikachu was meant to offer witty dialogues and not so politically correct jokes all around, but rarely manages to do so. I guess they held it back to ""protect"" the kids and avoid issues?However, glad to finally see a decent video game movie in a while!! Better than most of the Pokémon official animated movies anyway.",Pokémon Detective Pikachu

PG
starring: Ryan Reynolds,Justice smith,Kathryn Newton,Bill Nighy, Ken Watanabe,Suki Waterhouse and Rita Ora etcoverall rating 86/100Detective Pickachu was great, i mean really great yes with a few issues but not enough to make the film bad at all lets talk about why this film was brilliant and why it makes me excited for the future of Pokemon in film.First of all the film had excellent world building. Throughout the whole film i just wanted to be in that city with everyone, also it did well to educate casual fans or new fans about the source material. And i just thought it was really clever to create a world where humans and Pokemon can live and help one another. So i Applaud the directors creativity to make such an incredible film for the fans.Next the film was absolutely hilarious, This is mostly due to Ryan Reynolds. Ryan just is naturally funny in whatever film he is in and this was no different. He had so many great one liners and witty comments he really was the star of the film and any scene with him in was fantastic. Despite there being family and child friendly jokes there was also some fairly funny adult jokes that would go over kids heads which i absolutely loved. The film just got it so right with its comedic tone it was so nice to see and really made the film how great it was.Also i thought Justice smith did a fantastic job in this film. This was a completely different to what we saw of justice in jurrassic world 2 and i loved that. Every scene he was in no matter what tone or emotion he delivered excellently. Really making me feel every emotion of his character as well. He delivered in the funny scenes,emotional scenes and the serious scenes in what proved to me that Justice Smith deserves more roles in the future as well as being the star of this hopefully many film franchise, however i would like to add that i found Justices character Tims reaction to his fathers apparent death a bit off putting and uncomfortable. He was so emotionless and he just seemed to not care which positioned me in a weird place as a audience member watching however this was soon resolved so was not a huge issue.Next the film had stunning and interesting visuals. The film had incredible colours and set pieces for this Pokemon world that genuinely made you appreciate and try to digest the world that has been created. This was also helped by the excellent character designs of the Pokemon, Every single Pokemon looks exactly the same to how they should be maybe slightly more fluffy or realistic but that was not an issue at all it actually made it all better.Next i loved the action sequences in detective pickachu. Despite them being fairly over the top which i will talk about soon they were still a lot of fun to watch. Whether it was Pokemon battles or genetically enhanced Pokemon, the action sequences really showed off each pokemons main moves and powers which i appreciated and all there moved looked very realistic and i recognised all the moves so this was a great throwback for me. Talking about throwbacks i adored the references to the old pokemon tv series and games. Whether the animation was the style of the old games or Ryan Reynolds singing the old theme tune there was a lot of nods to pokemon when i was growing up so this will keep fans of the series very happy.However as previously mentioned there was some very over the top and unrealistic scenes. Aside from the obvious pokemon scenes, a lot of the action sequences most of characters were running around screaming which was fairly irratating in places, and also Tims character was put into a few situations were he obviously would not of survived. Whether it was jumping about 100ft off a mountain or falling off a mountain into the sea these scenes were very like a ""they would of been dead"".Next i really loved that all the pokemon actually had realistic jobs if they were to be real. Just little details like squirtle helping with the fire department and machamp stopping cars on roads, i just loved the little details that everyone working on this film added just to please the fans even more.I also loved that this film actually had a surprising amount of emotional depth to it. The added emotion of Tim losing his mum and only just finding out his dad really wanted a relationship with him was actually very heartwarming and even emotional at times. And Pickachu could also be very sweet with Tims character as well so this was lovely to seeNext i loved the narrative character development between Pickachu and Tim. Seeing there friendship develop was very entertaining and heartwarming to see. Pickachu was the friend and companion that Tim needed in a time where his emotions were all over the place. And pickachu would be the Pokemon companion that anyone would want in that kind of world with his humour and fluffiness!Just a final little issue i had, i thought there was some issues with the tone during the film. The film established a nostalgic and funny tone throughout but then they decided to add a more serious tone when pickachu abandoned Tim for a while i thought this was a slightly unnecessary change to the tone that could of been cut.And finally the films mystery was very interesting and there was some great plot twists that kept you interested. The film was genuinely unpredictable and kept you questioning what was going to happen which was very rare with these types of film. They led you to believe one thing and then do the complete opposite.So despite a couple of flaws. Detective pickachu was a fantastic,fun and unpredictable adventure that has got me excited for pokemons future in film.",Pokémon Detective Pikachu
117,Donatien3,One of the best - and strangest - video game movies,7,18 April 2020,"Most video game movies tend to be horrible (too many to mention), but 'Detective Pikachu' is actually pretty good.It helps that it's got the star power of Ryan Reynolds (having to tone it down a bit after his ""adult"" performances in the 'Deadpool' movies, 'The Hitman's Bodyguard', and '6 Underground'), and most of the Pokemon are adorable (especially Pikachu in his little detective hat). Though it doesn't coast off Reynolds and the Pokemon's charm factor, packing in a deeper-than-expected mystery. The basic premise is drawn from the 'Detective Pikachu' Nintendo 3DS game.If anything, this movie tries a bit too hard, and starts getting a bit ridiculous with all the twists and turns, although it all makes sense in the end (sort of).Even if you've never played a Pokemon game, you can still enjoy this as as a solid - if a bit far fetched - detective/mystery movie.",Pokémon Detective Pikachu

While the animation and effects are so good, the bad story is sad not only bad but simple, boring, and predictable.I was expecting pokemon to be a movie for kids, but not that much. Actually, the images are fine, the pokemon universe is well designed but this simple story that spoils everything is also silly and simple scenes.The casting was generally good in the final scene, surprising Ryan Reynolds as the father of the main character. I can say that the film is not good or even mediocre, but it is watched without getting bored.",Pokémon Detective Pikachu

120,movieman6-413-929510,"With Detective Pikachu, people can relive their Pokémon fantasies.",6,11 May 2019,"Pokémon Detective Pikachu is a new live-action adventure film directed and partly written by Rob Letterman, the director of Goosebumps and Shark Tale.The film is about a world where people catch and train Pokémon, but in Ryme City people and Pokémon live side by side. 21-year-old Tim Goodman (Justice Smith) has little to do with Pokémon, but still goes to Ryme City to find his missing father.
In his father's apartment Tim meets Detective Pikachu (voice of Ryan Reynolds), whom he can strangely understand. Detective Pikachu is also looking for Tim his father. He is also addicted to coffee and he suffers from memory loss. The two now have to work together to find Tim his father and find out where he has gone.With this film old and young Pokémon fans can revive their (childhood) dream, because many Pokémon fans fantasized or still fantasize about becoming a Pokémon trainer. Pokémon fans come from different angles, because one is interested in Pokémon affected by the card game or the video game while others have come back to Pokémon thanks to the TV series or the films. This way both young and old viewers can recognize things from this film and enjoy it a little more. This can be a good family or family movie if there are many Pokémon fans in the family. For older viewers, the plottwist can become somewhat predictable at a time, but luckily this doesn't ruin the rest of the film for them.Different generations can also recognize the different generations of Pokémon in the film. For example, older viewers are probably more familiar with the first 150 Pokémon while younger viewers may know the more modern Pokémon better. The film is also filled with references to things from the video games and TV series.The film has good effects. Most Pokémon look good and realistic. A few can be seen more clearly that they were placed in the film with CGI, but this is mostly due to the special shapes that these Pokémon have. The Pokémon know how to carry the film with their presence in the film, because otherwise the human characters don't seem so special.Although the human characters do not come across as special, the acting is well done. Justice Smith and Kathryn Newton are largely credible in communicating while they have to deal with many non-existent CGI characters and creatures.Ryan Reynolds still carries the film with his voice acting as Detective Pikachu. Like Deadpool, he knows how to make many comic comments about the story or events. He knows how to do this in a child-friendly way. There are some hidden adult jokes in the film, but these children will not really notice or understand.",Pokémon Detective Pikachu
121,SilverOrlov,Terribly,5,18 June 2019,"Visually, this film is very, very good. But everything else is just awful: Absolutely silly and flat humor. Absolutely stupid acts of main heroes. Even if you imagine that this film is exclusively for children and/or Pokemon fans - this is just a terrible realization. Even the Pokemon-protagonist behaves like a clown"" with his jokes and deeds. Unsuccessful plague of Marvel style.",Pokémon Detective Pikachu
122,WalkdenEntertainment,Enjoyable! (And I Don't Even Like Pokemon!),7,6 March 2020,"After a detective mysteriously disappears during a case the detective's son, Tim (Justice Smith), takes it upon himself to investigate further. Thankfully Tim doesn't have to do this alone. You see, in the present day of this film, Pokémon characters live with humans and they are partnered up with one another. But Tim for personal reason doesn't have a Pokémon by his side until he meets a cute little yellow character known as Pikachu...I must confess, I'm not by any means a Pokémon fan nor have I ever really watched the cartoon! But by popular demand, I agreed to watch this film to review. PTo my surprise, this is actually an enjoyable family film even if you know nothing about Pokémon. The film thankfully gives it's audience a quick rundown of the film's world as well as an understanding on what Pokémon actually are and what they do on Earth. This type of quick setup/introduction was perfect for non Pokémon fans.What makes this film entertaining is the fairly interesting mystery, meaning that naturally an audience of any age will be curious to journey with Tim, even more so once Tim is introduced to Pikachu which is voiced by funny man Ryan Reynolds.I found Ryan Reynolds as Pikachu enjoyable. He delivers the typical type of humour for him as an actor with many quick and random one liners. The appearance of Pikachu as a character on screen is also done well and credit to the CGI department (because as my wife said ""Pikachu is cute"").The film makes creative use of colours, almost like a cartoon. Each character, location or situation has a strong colour tone and it's done really well from a visual point of view.As a plot, while the mystery and disappearance of Tim's father was tricky to work out, I will admit the film's villain was far too predictable, but hey, it's a family film right?Overall, considering I'm not a Pokémon fan, I am surprised at how much I enjoyed this film. It's light hearted family entertainment with a few twists and turns. The film gives a great setup for non Pokémon fans along with the film's leading characters being enjoyable on screen (Particularly Pikachu voiced by Ryan Reynolds).7.0/10 - Walkden Entertainment",Pokémon Detective Pikachu
123,coombsstephen,Good fun even for someone who knows nothing about Pokemon,7,10 May 2019,"Knowing nothing about Pokemon I didn't have high expectations for this film expecting maybe a kids film I didn't understand but thankfully it was a great surprise that this was a funny film that needed no Pokemon knowledge to enjoy.The plot of the film isn't too deep, which is expected as a kids film, but that doesn't stop the laughs coming and some good action scenes. However the most standout thing in the film, as a Londoner, is the incredible CGI which uses London as a base but puts an almost Tokyo layer on top of it.Some of the acting is not brilliant and the overall film does probably have another layer for Pokemon fans but non fans should not be put off going.",Pokémon Detective Pikachu

125,patriciogl10,Great for a first offering.,7,2 December 2019,"One can't help but to be skeptical about a Pokémon live-action adaptation. For one thing, CGI has to be of respectable quality and the story has to be as close to a Pokémon story as possible. The former met my expectations and the latter, while it wasn't really the case, I didn't mind at all because it was a nice story, perfectly adequate for a first film, which can grow into a more daring franchise, because the room that there is to cover is ridiculously extensive, so there will be plenty of opportunities for Pokémon stories to grace our screens.Ryan Reynolds is impeccable as the voice of Detective Pikachu and Justice Smith built an acceptable character performance which serves its purpose for the story.The CGI is phenomenal, really well accomplished. It was endearing to see so many Pokémon you know from an unforgettable childhood being beautifully realized. Even though I'm one to think that a world where Pokémon exists could be even better portrayed, but that notion was acceptably executed in this film. Mewtwo is probably one of the best parts of the film, so magnificently captured, so powerful, relentless and untameable.Some Pokémon designs are spectacular, some much better than others; and the fur factor, was particularly impressive. If you are a Pokémon fan you should really watch it and see how you feel about it, my guess is you will enjoy it. Now that we have gotten a taste of what an live-action adaptation is, we certainly need more.",Pokémon Detective Pikachu

But, there's nothing ground breaking or inspiring beyond being themildly interesting, fmaily action movie. It was definately interesting seeing the pokemon in the movie, seeing them interact with the citizens and seeing the roles they play is definately intersesting, but beyond the pokemons who are undoubtedly the stars the story is pretty standard and cliche.

131,AdrenalinDragon,Sadly this did not break the Video Game Movie curse,4,10 May 2019,"Pokemon Detective Pikachu had potential as a concept, but sadly it was poorly executed in my opinion. There's alot of Pokemon nostalgia and fan-service
franchise references in there for sure, but the story itself is very weak. You can see where things are heading straight away and it felt very dumbed down for
kids rather than aiming for both kids and adults. I was really shocked at how bad the acting was in this movie. It really distracted me from taking the Human characters seriously, and they were easily the worst part of the movie. There are scenes in the movie which try to pull off emotion but it falls flat. There is a very small part of the Pokemon game stuff in there like catching Pokemon and battling them, but it's mostly filler rather than being relevant to the plot.Detective Pikachu himself fairs a little better, but his quips and little jokey comments get a bit tiring after a while. I wasn't even the biggest fan of the CGI Pokemon honestly, as they just look weird and kind of creepy rather than cute. They should have just gone for the Who Framed Roger Rabbit approach and made them Cartoon animated instead of realistic. Plot contrivances and weird things happening for no logical reason, as well as scenes which were surprisingly boring. I kind of liked the idea of Pokemon and Humans living together, and the small snippets we see of them do jobs for people and other tasks in the background is a nice touch, but that only really appears in the first half of the movie and then it just becomes bland and generic. The showdown near the end has some okay action to it, but to me it just felt like this should have been much, much better than what we ended up with in terms of twists and turns.As a big Pokemon fan, I was disappointed with this movie. I felt it should have been structured better in the story and making it more interesting rather
than focusing on showing off the Pokemon stuff and references. They needed to make the Human characters more entertaining rather than just the Pokemon themselves. Seeing my favourite Pokemon in CGI Live Action and noticing a reference to the games isn't enough for me. This is a sloppy, executed movie that could have been so much more and seems to coast on nostalgia and callbacks. I have no idea how someone who never cared for Pokemon could get into this, but if you're a Pokemon fan I'd say it's probably worth at least one watch. As for me, I'm still hoping for a genuinely good Video Game movie that will break the curse, but Detective Pikachu isn't the answer to that sadly.4/10",Pokémon Detective Pikachu
132,cgearheart,Very Satisfying,8,20 May 2019,"Pokemon: Detective Pikachu is so far the biggest surprise at the movies this year.The premise sounds silly, and believe me, it is, but the filmmakers pulled it off. Not only did they successfully adapt a cartoon, but they also adapted a video game with flying colors, which we already know is no easy feat. Of course, we are missing some beloved characters and are treated to a few obvious plot twists, but the result is nothing short of astonishing. The visuals are incredibly clean and breathtaking and the action is steadily paced.
Ryan Reynolds, as always, steals the show with a witty and utterly charming performance of the beloved title character and is always there to chime in something funny.B+",Pokémon Detective Pikachu
133,sirwillisiv,"A solid love letter to the franchise and a fun, well-executed treat for fans...",8,12 May 2019,"Admittedly when the first trailer launched, I was among those with uncertain thoughts about how the film would turn out, especially after seeing the hyper-realistic Mr. Mime. Overtime, I developed an open mind and warmed up to the seemingly charming premise and even started to appreciate the filmmakers maintaining the original designs of the featured Pokémon despite their realistic (and slightly creepy) updates, especially in light of the Sonic the Hedgehog film's trailer, which depicts an uncanny version of the blue blur. I digress, though. I'm happy to share that I walked out of Detective Pikachu with a warm, youthful and fulfilled feeling. I was legitimately charmed and entertained by this film and I can safely say its the best video game adaptation to come out of a long line of mediocre pictures.Detective Pikachu completely embraces the Pokémon lore to dish out an effectively character-driven and visually stunning mystery with few decent surprises in store. Granted, it's a pretty conventional narrative with its moments of predictability, but I don't necessarily see that as a harsh flaw in this case. Every film has clichés, but its how those clichés are used that ultimately make a difference. As foreseeable as it is, the mystery is well put together and uses the franchise's lore and philosophies to its advantage. My biggest concern was that Hollywood was just gonna make up their own nonsensical mythology that betrays everything recognizable about Pokémon, but to my surprise there wasn't a single moment that seemed forced and out of touch. The filmmakers understood exactly what kind of fictional world they were adapting and they did it right.My criticisms are mainly subjective. First off, I wish more effort was put into the comedy. I never laughed out loud, only smiled and chuckled, especially at the few risque jokes that managed to slip their way into the script. Secondly, I feel some of the live-action performances could've used an extra few takes as some of the delivery was awkward and unconvincing. Thirdly, and this doesn't effect the final score, I'm really bummed that none of my favorite Pokémon appeared in the film. The spectrum of Pokémon that make an appearance is shockingly small, so don't build up your hopes to spot your most beloved species on the big screen. Again, nothing against the film. I'm sure special scenes were cut and the animators had a strict modeling deadline.What makes Detective Pikachu a particularly strong enough viewing is the chemistry between the protagonist Tim Goodman and the titular electric mouse. Their backstories are relatable and their interplay is likable to the point where I cared just enough about their relationship. It's not just one-liner after one-liner, there's a believable connection present between the two and they work together to fix their personal flaws and make their lives better. They're not the most perfect duo to ever take the spotlight, but I certainly didn't want to see them in turmoil or get split apart, and when that happened I felt genuinely sad, just like when Ash released Butterfree in the anime. Tailoring the film is Ryan Reynolds as Pikachu. Without his fun-loving influence, this film wouldn't be half the product it is.As a lifetime fan of Pokémon, I can safely say that Detective Pikachu is a faithful re-imagining of the Japanese cultural phenomenon. I really liked this film, despite its clichés. It's a cute little adventure that I look forward to revisiting multiple times in the future and witnessing how it continues with its planned sequels. The film is receiving a mixed response from mainstream critics, but I don't think this film was really made for them. Their criticisms are valid, but art is subjective and I'm confident Pokémon diehards will appreciate a lot from this picture regardless of its ordinary structure. It's the presentation and loyalty to the franchise that really shines through. Detective Pikachu is solid love letter to the franchise and a fun, well-executed treat for fans.",Pokémon Detective Pikachu

The villain as well was also really engaging with an interesting plan.The movie felt a little cliched in some parts, but apart from that it was very enjoyable. I myself never really got into Pokémon or really have played the games up until this point, but now after seeing a movie that made such a well realised Pokémon world, I definitely might consider playing the next Pokémon game when it comes out.Overall a very solid and entertaining movie which captured the magic of the Pokémon world very well with engaging and entertaining characters.

It's not really the movie's fault, I just wasn't excited about seeing the Pokemons on screen. Pikachu it's super funny to watch and the voice acting is good. The actors do their part well, even though the characters aren't great in my opinion, it does the job for an adventure like this.
The CGI is not bad, but the characters designs are heavily based in the anime and for some of them it works well, but for some others it doesn't. There's no re-design for any of the Pokemons, which I'm sure fans will love, but when you're watching a live action movie, textures need to resemble something real (even if it's a fantasy monster) for the eye to believe in it. With Pikachu it works well because it's hairy, but I really disliked Mewtwo look, even if he looks exactly like in the anime.
Anyways, it was fun to watch, and the city's design and atmosphere was really cool.

140,RhapsodyReviews,Big Surprise of the Summer.,8,3 February 2020,"Review:
'Pokémon Detective Pikachu' is a fantasy-mystery film directed by Rob Letterman. It is based on the Pokémon franchise created by Satoshi Tajiri and serves as a loose adaptation of the video game of the same name.
I have been a Pokémon fan for many years, and I was very hesitant when the trailer first came out and especially with the stigma around video games getting movie adaptions that never work out. This movie was a nice surprise.
In a world where people collect pocket-size monsters (Pokémon) to do battle, a boy comes across an intelligent monster who seeks to be a detective.
Ryan Reynolds once again continues to deliver amazing comedy while also tugging at our heartstrings in serious moments. He is hands down the best part of this movie, while other characters didn't necessarily hit as others. Justice Smith does a good job as the human character that was needed to drive the story but isn't the character you go to see this movie for.
The movie itself has a great storyline that I won't give away, the real-life adaptions of the Pokémon are beautiful and it's almost exactly how I'd imagine them if they were in the real world, the effects are amazing! They could have gone down the hyper realistic route which would have been devastating, but they looked fantastic.
Overall, this movie hit on almost all aspects you would want it to. It stayed true to what Pokémon is, but also grew the lore enough to make a movie that stood out against all other video game-based adaptations.

143,MinistryofDoom,"Fantastic film, even for those not necessarily into Pokemon",8,27 June 2019,"The world in which this film exists is one where Pokemon and people live together. It's not explained how or why but that's just how things are, and we brought into the personal story of one kid, living within this world, who is in search of his father. The story is very well done. The action is exciting. The Pokemon featured in the film do not look tacked on. Rather they feel very well integrated in settings of the film and very well animated so that one immediately comes to ease with the normalcy of living in a world of Pokemon. This is further reiterated by the normal everyday actions of the people living there. They live like you and I, going about their daily lives....among Pokemon. I very much like how this was done without forcing an explanation or an awkward, ""Hey look, it's a Pokemon!"". In that world, no one cares because Pokemon are a normal aspect of life. Just as how in our world, you'd expct to see a squirrel playing under a tree at the local park, they would naturally expect a Cubone to bounce around through tall grass or a Snorlax to take a nap by the side of the road.Video Game Adaptors, take note: this is how you correctly do it. Establish a genuine story within that world, instead of using the 1-2 hour time frame as an advertisement for some brand or product.",Pokémon Detective Pikachu
144,jakebrann,Justice Smith alone ruined this movie...,2,8 June 2020,"Unfortunately, imo this guy given the lead role to play Tim, did a horrible job! He can't act! He alone ruined this and even Ryan Reynolds couldn't counteract the bad acting from this clown.So I've never been a fan of or invested any time in getting to understand the whole Pokemon thing but I gave this movie a shot because I like Ryan Reynolds. He was bound to say some funny stuff and let Deadpool leak out a little bit, which he did and that was all fine and dandy but my whole issue with this movie stems from the lead actor, Tim... he's just a bad actor and he looked like he was reading cue cards the whole time! Any scene that required emotion from him was cringe-worthy. He wasn't the right fit for this role. Obviously they had the money to hire Ryan Reynolds so they should have been able to find someone better to play the main character!I know this isn't much of a review but I just had to put that out there considering all these 9-10 star reviews (God only knows what they were watching?)... I did laugh a couple times, most memorable time being the scene with the Mime pokemon thing who though he was getting away...
Anyway, even with my low 2 ⭐ review somehow the movie is still worth the watch if you don't expect much and just prepare to see some pretty bad acting.",Pokémon Detective Pikachu

Anyway, the movie is very funny, emotional, have a lot of references and a cool journey to follow.",Pokémon Detective Pikachu
146,snowfre,Entertaining but lacks some desired nostalgia and needs more Pokémon,6,10 March 2020,"Set in a mesmerizing world where Pokémon and humans live side by side, ""Detective Pikachu"" follows human Tim Goodman (Smith) who teams up with Pikachu (strangely but entertainingly voices by Reynolds) to find out wether or not his father has been killed or not. My expectations? Let's say I was skeptical, I feared they wouldn't pull it of, instead just delivering us a frenzy of Pokémon with a weak script. But I must say, ""Detective Pikachu"" is entertaining and visually stunning. The originality of the many Pokémon is extraordinary, as they truly look like real, living creatures. Now the plot itself? It's fun, although it suffers from a few plot holes, nothing that disturbs the entire storyline however. What lowered my rating somewhat is the lack of nostalgia. I know it's not only 90s-kid that grew up with the Pokémon, but I think ""Detective Pikachu"" could be more fan pleasing and nostalgic towards its many fans. Overall though, this is an entertaining film. Many times, I find myself forgetting the overall plot, and the film's antagonist isn't really convincing, his motives are very - let's say - unclear. ""Detective Pikachu"" is still a fun, exciting movie for the entire family.",Pokémon Detective Pikachu

They both run into many problems threw their crazy journey.Detective Pikachu was a fun and exciting movie to watch. The CGI was pretty solid. If you really wanted to you could count the hairs of Pikachu. Justice Smith did a good job as the main character but all the other actors couldn't really do anything to help their part from the bad writing. The references to the 90s Pokemon was a good touch. The only other thing was the trailer. It spoiled all of the good jokes. Also the lighting was a little off I thought. It seemed like that one scene form vertigo were the room was green from the lights. It was just like that for the whole movie.Overall, Detective Pikachu was a fun movie to watch with the family.",Pokémon Detective Pikachu

Justice Smith was great and I'm excited to see his future endeavors. Visually the movie is pretty gorgeous. The Pokemon theme and beautiful real life recreations of the fans most recognizable Pokemon is very well executed. The plot was interesting, it started with some funny scenes based around classic detective movie tropes but then overtime devolved into more of an action. Fun and full of fanservice.",Pokémon Detective Pikachu
149,arishsankar,The curse is finally over.,6,16 May 2019,"Without hesitation, I can confirm that Detective Pikachu is the best video game movie following a long line of mediocre adaptations.

150,elenaphysics,Really nice but it could have been excellent,8,14 November 2019,"This is a great movie for kids. It is fun and nice story. It has some nice plot twists
and it was nice to watch.
The beginning was a bit slow.I mean it could be faster-paced.
I liked it overall, pikachu was very well-made and cute.
The reason I gave it 8 stars and not 10, is because it was not funny I guess. The jokes were not so great. And I would love to see more pokemons in the movie showing their powers.
But I would like to see a part 2 in the near future.",Pokémon Detective Pikachu
151,pokemon_trainer_lucas,A fantastic Pokemon live action movie,10,21 June 2019,"As the first Pokemon movie where we see realistically portrayed Pokemon, I am not disappointed! I've read some people complaining that ""Pikachu doesn't look right with fur"" which is just ridiculous, because at the end of the day, Pikachu is an electric mouse and so if it were to be portrayed in a live action movie then it would have fur just like a real mammal/rodent would. I thought the appearances of the Pokemon made for a very exciting and realistic journey into the Pokemon world. The storyline was intriguing and kept you guessing, and this movie leaves you thinking that the possibilities are endless for future live action Pokemon movies, such as Ash Ketchum and his Pikachu, and Team Rocket and Meowth! I recommend this movie to all.",Pokémon Detective Pikachu
152,EasternZZ,"Great world, bad story.",6,19 May 2019,"This captures the world of Pokemon pretty well, but it falters in the story segment. The story is just a little bit too cliche and simple, and this movie should had focused on a kid trying to train his Pikachu. We don't really get a lot of Pokemon battle, and the acting is kinda weird, and it reminds me of acting that we see on TV kid shows. It is not bad acting, but it is not very good either. The editing also seems a little off, and this really does look like a TV kid show with some good CGI creatures.Ken Watanabe is barely in the movie and does nothing at all. There is really no character development, and the ""bad guy's"" plan makes ABSOLUTELY no sense at all. It is a huge confusing mess during the final 20 minutes.Anyways, the story is not really good, so it is a 6/10.",Pokémon Detective Pikachu
153,theredsky,Pokemon: Detective Pikachu Review,3,11 June 2019,"This is a crappy movie. It's not the worst movie ever but it's pretty bad. Here are the positives. Some of the Pokemon designs are good and creative. Some of the visual effects are good. Ken Watanabe, Bill Nighy, and Ryan Reynolds do a fine job with the terrible script they are given. The negatives far far outweigh the positives. This is one of the most predictable films I have ever seen. It's beat for beat a basic mystery film and it's incredibly annoying. I was able to predict every outcome that was going to happen, the surprise villains, and every single twist. It makes the experience incredibly boring and tedious. There are a ton of cliches in the film which is also annoying. All the other actors especially Kathryn Newton did an awful job. They deliver their lines so bland and boring that you wanna claw your ears out. Some of the other Pokemon designs are atrocious and the visual effects for them don't help either. They gave Mewtwo teeth. Just why? The script for this movie is also terrible. Every single line feels incredibly forced and unnatural. Some of the characters talk over each other and you can't understand what they are saying. Some of the story elements are so confusing and come out of nowhere that it starts to become distracting. This film is edited and paced horribly. The cuts are so random and some scenes serve no purpose. The film starts really slow but then starts moving very very quickly. Overall, Pokemon Detective Pikachu is a predictable film filled with bad acting,a bad script, and a poor story. I give Pokemon: Detective Pikachu a 3/10.",Pokémon Detective Pikachu

So no spoliers, but I would recommend a watch if you like a fantasy/comedy flick and a solid 8/10",Pokémon Detective Pikachu

He quickly gets wrapped up in a murder mystery with a talking Pokemon Pikachu that only he can understand.A live action comedy adventure that kids and adults will enjoy. The smart talking Pikachu is great. The comedy works throughout and there are a couple of stand-out funny scenes. A dash of romance and redemption complete the show. It all makes sense in the end.The action and specials effects are pretty good.

157,troy-daniel-bush,Okay...,3,31 October 2019,"The writing is awful. It's cheesy, predictable, and even downright cringy at times. This is especially the case with the dialogue. In my eyes, if the dialogue sucks, then the movie sucks. And they tell and don't show a lot of things. There are honestly lines in this movie that make you think, ""Are you kidding me?!"" And you can see the plot twists coming a mile away.The characters are kinda irritating. What I find the most irritating about them is that I feel like they had potential.The acting is terrible.

159,joshbarton15,Pika Pika...,6,12 May 2019,"With how big Pokemon still is since it began in the 90s, I'm surprised a film like Pokemon Detective Pikachu hasn't come along sooner. Combining live action with digitally created monsters is something we haven't seen from Pokemon yet and with Ryan Reynolds, a man who could just about sell anything, on board, this film has the potential to open up this franchise to a whole new audience.When Tim Goodman (Justice Smith) learns of his father's death, he travels to Ryme City, a place where humans and Pokemon live alongside one another, to find answers. It's not long before he comes across an intelligent talking Pikachu (Ryan Reynolds), determined to prove Tim's father isn't actually dead.Waiting for Detective Pikachu to start, I was sat not knowing what to expect at all, and I don't think I was the only one. Even without knowing much about Pokemon, this film is an immensely entertaining ride, full of plenty of gags and solid action sequences. Kids will love the amount of Pokemon that are scattered throughout to spot while adults can enjoy some of the surprisingly risqué jokes littered here and there.Jokes and Pokemon aside, there's a surprisingly emotional narrative to be found, it just chooses to make some major revelations at some rather bizarre times. There's one moment that should have come way earlier than it did and I'll never understand why they decided to leave it until the very end.Coming to the performances, Detective Pikachu has Ryan Reynolds firing on all cylinders with a fine vocal performance as Pikachu, combining with fantastic visual effects to bring the cutest character of 2019 to life. The human side of the film is where things are found to be lacking a little, Justice Smith not really bringing anything interesting to the role and Kathryn Newton getting nowhere enough screen time to make any impact.In all honesty, I enjoyed Detective Pikachu a lot more than I imagined I would, Ryan Reynolds being the film's saving grace. He's a smart man really because we all know the next Deadpool film, whenever that may be, will see him making enough references about playing the little yellow guy.",Pokémon Detective Pikachu

However, there were a couple of things about the movie that I just could not hate. The scenery was a true feast for the eye. The ending was good. Pikachu was cute and funny. And there were a couple of jokes in the film that I found very funny.But, there were some things about the movie that I didn't think was good. The storytelling was weak, at least to a certain degree. The story was quite predictable. I could already tell who the main antagonist was before the 'reveal' (but I will not give spoilers). The plot was rather scattered.

Unfortunately, that's not a very high bar to reach. That's how this good-not-great film has earned that title. It's a pretty generic tale and the central mystery isn't all that compelling, but Ryan Reynolds' fun performance and some excellent CGI make this a pretty entertaining time. Unfortunately, it's let down quite a bit by its predictable third act that gets too big and traditional for its own good. It's also fairly forgettable as a whole, but thankfully it's well made and sufficiently entertaining throughout, which can't be said for the large majority of video game adaptations. 6/10",Pokémon Detective Pikachu

163,rcolgan,Probably the Best Movie Based on a Video Game (By Default),6,11 May 2019,"When they first announced a live action Pokemon movie, there was instantly a concern that the film could end up being a disaster. Largely because it seems like such a difficult thing to translate all of their 2d designs into a 3d environment without having them end up looking incredibly creepy. Just look at the goombas in the Super Mario Bros. or whatever that blue thing was in the trailer for the Sonic the Hedgehog movie and you'll see how bad these kind of adaptations can go. But here, the VFX team and conceptual designers behind this movie nailed every one of these designs, bringing these Pokemon in to a live action world without losing any of the charm of the original designs.Beyond the visual aesthetic, they do a fantastic job at establishing all of the Pokemon's personalities. There are so many little touches that show a real appreciation for the franchises lore, like Charizard's weakness being his tail or mentioning Cubone wears his mother's skull. Plus there are so many great gags and moments through seeing the Pokemon interact with the world, like Machop organising traffic around a napping snorlax or a team of squirtles working for the fire department. Seeing the way they adapt their world around these Pokemon is sure to satisfy any long time fan of the franchise.But for people who didn't grow up with the games, there's probably not going to be much here. Unlike something like Who Framed Roger Rabbit, where even without all the animated characters there's still a cool noir inspired mystery, the rest of Detective Pikachu doesn't really hold up. We have a basic setup where after a detective goes missing, the detective's son arrives in the city to find out what happened. Whilst there he bumps into a Pikachu who is a detective and sets out to help him find out what happened to his father. They quickly uncover your typical conspiracy and realise that they need to save the city.There's a lot of inconsistencies throughout the film that don't really add up and you'll probably be able to guess most of the plot within the first 20 minutes of the film. Although there is one goofy twist with one Pokemon which I won't spoil but did get a few great chuckles out of me.As much as I'm still hoping for a Danny Devito dub of the film, Reynolds did a pretty great job as Detective Pikachu. He infuses a lot of his own personality in to the role, but still keeps it distinct enough so it doesn't just feel like another Deadpool. But whilst all the Pokemon characters are all colourful and memorable, all the humans are just very bland by comparison. Kathryn Newton was pretty funny early on, playing her role as ridiculously over the top as a live action anime character should be, but it felt like her role simmered out as the film went on. Then the rest of the human felt like they were only there to move the story along and didn't have enough of a personality to leave any real impression.This film is probably going to split audiences into two categories. If you're a fan of the franchise, there's enough comedy and fan service that you'll probably have a good time. But if Pokemon's never been your thing, this isn't the film that's going to change your mind. I guess it may technically be the best movie based on a video game. But when the competition includes the likes of Uwe Boll movies, Max Payne and Assassins Creed, that's not really much of a compliment.",Pokémon Detective Pikachu

167,MovieJunkie5,Overhyped,6,10 September 2019,"Ryan Reynolds' sarcastic-type pikachu was probably the only thing entertaining in this movie apart from the visual effects. Barely no acting, since no scene required much emotion, the plot is cheesy and the dialogue is somewhat lame with the exception of a few lines between Pikachu and its partner. Sound is ok and the visual effects seemed very good. Letterman has done better movies and it's capable of much more. Overall, a throwback to good old Pokémon and nothing else.",Pokémon Detective Pikachu
168,datautisticgamer-74853,A personally underwhelming flick,5,19 May 2019,"I have been a fan of Pokémon pretty much all my life, from watching my brother play the original Game Boy games to playing them myself, from Red and Blue all the way to Black 2 and White 2 (my favorites will forever be the GBA titles). I also had a fondness for its infamous anime, to the point where I can defend a few of its movies. That said, I was actually not expecting this one to be THAT good, but I felt terrible after watching it. What disappointed me more than it should have?In all fairness, the designs of virtually all of the depicted Pokémon translate very well into CGI, enhancing the feel that each species is intended to give off. The way that they molded one of Nintendo's cartoonier series into live-action environments with such effects is what makes the action scenes epic and the world of Ryme City believable as a setting. There are some, like Jigglypuff, that probably needed a tad more work to be upgraded from a 2D sprite yet still feel like the same Pokémon. Combined with the effective performances of the human actors, Detective Pikachu is conceptually more complex than a lot of other video game movies, coming with the possibilities of every corner of Ryme City and all 809 species of Pokémon, and how it intersects. What really crashes it is its execution; the movie is quite focused on Tim and Pikachu's quest that it doesn't give itself much time to reveal how Pokémon specifically act in the human world. We don't get a lot of questions answered about how Wild Pokémon assimilated into a highly urban environment, and many more, that people who are not fans of the franchise will face likely bewilderment. Likewise, Pokémon fans will also probably not like how they couldn't even fit some sort of reference to every currently confirmed Pokémon (for example, there isn't a very good balance of species between generations), like maybe a brief Pokédex during the credits or something. I will give that the actors and voices gave their most with the material they were provided, that the action is convincing, and that some of the jokes do provide the chuckles (though it wouldn't have hurt to have made an R-rated cut so Reynolds could give Pikachu the Deadpool treatment).Even looking at it as a big fan of the franchise, I found it hard to enjoy this movie. It feels too alien with its main story to please Pokémon fans, while non-fans will not receive an in-depth explanation of what Pokémon truly are. I do believe I can recommend this to people who are true PokéManiacs (as in, die-hard fans). However, if you're just looking for a movie to bring your kids to, then this may actually be worth passing over in favor of the anime movies. Yes, I know that some of them are lower quality movies in general, but they're developed better as Pokémon movies through their dedication to the central characters and the ever amusing mischief of Team Rocket. Of course, if you grew up watching the anime or playing the games and have children right now, you could always introduce them to this great franchise through these means. I do not advise using this movie as such a gateway, for its intensity and lack of faith to the rest of the franchise compared to the anime movies will likely repulse them.",Pokémon Detective Pikachu
169,Dello_,"Good first try, expecting more to come",6,25 May 2019,"Detective Pikachu is a good movie but it doesn't stand out. Everything is superficial and every aspect (plot, direction, cast, structure) is 'only' regular and there are no inspired moments or highly memorable ones. Having said all of that it is an entertaining movie with some fun and action. Ryan Reynold has done a great job as Pikachu and his character was the best thing of the film. If you are a fan of the Pokemon Franchise you will probably be satisfied with the movie because there are a lot of references to the videogames and the anime episodes. Last important aspect is the CGI that is more convincing than not, with only few characters/moments that were off.

Some of the Pokémon were kind of cute like Pikachu and Jigglypuff. There were some scenes that were emotional. I saw the other trailer with Mewtwo's appearance.

174,TheGreatMarkukini,An expensive parade of cuteness,4,12 May 2019,"I was one of the countless children who woke up early in the morning or ran from the school faster that Flash himself to watch a boy in the cap catch some Pokemon. Growing up I left behind that part of my life, but all the trailers have awoken little adventurous spirit again, but to be honest I was not expecting much.Don't expect a lot - won't get disappointed. This rule has helped me enjoy the movie and leave without hard feelings of wasting my time. No age restriction told right away that all the action will be regulated by the children-friendly police, so no blood and bruises, which is fairly acceptable. However, on the top of that we get a storyline that is as flat as the Earth in opinion of some people. Of course, it struggles to look well-rounded and interesting, but the obvious things just keep popping out.Another point that brings down the impression is the randomness of the scenes. The connection of the narration is in the place, but then the solution to bring the plot together is very liquid and raw. A few moments looked as at the last moment before the production the director decided to add a little bit more of action and just cramped it into a good movie.The bright side was the wide use of Pokemon. You see all kinds of adorable creatures that draw your attention immediately and happy giggles just come out involuntarily. The quality of animation tries to be climb to the top, but sometimes it experiences some loose rocks and falls down in order to keep ascending.Putting back my fan cap on the shelf I would say that the attempt to bring the childhood onto the big screen didn't succeed in the full extend. For sure, many veteran viewers grew up by this point and the new generation don't quite get the hype of past years. If creators wanted to bring in new followers, they will not be disappointed as for children the movie was great. But don't let them fool you, hardcore lovers of Pokemon will not find what they were looking.",Pokémon Detective Pikachu
175,C-Younkin,Fine for Avid fans,6,8 May 2019,"Detective Pikachu is a movie for Pokemon fans in the truest sense of the word. It's nice, but if you don't understand the appeal of a MewToo, don't expect many answers.for the rest of us this is really another opportunity to see if Ryan Reynold's charisma and sarcasm can make anything watchable and no surprise, he is really one of the best parts of it.Also Justice Smith, who plays Tim Goodman. He has to head to the Pokemon-human utopia of Rhyme city when his detective father is lost. It's there he meets dad's pokemon partner Pikachu and together they both have to figure out what happened.Like I said, Smith is great here. You might know him from the Netflix show The Get Down, Jurassic World 2 was so bad I thought it was trying to derail the kid's movie career before it even started.But here he plays a very lonely kid who doesn't really fit with anything or anyone.Of course he fits perfectly with Pikachu Reynold's voices. He swerves perfectly between being sincere and offering up a funny line and whether or not they become fast friends in never in doubt.This movie was directed by Rob Letterman, who also made the first Goosebumps movie, and he's pretty good with zany animation.The pokemon monsters are sometimes cute, sometimes odd and make up most of the hit-or-miss gags in the movie.Having some prior knowledge of the characters may determine your level of enjoyment with them. To me I laughed a couple times but also I have to say we're already 2 movies into this summer and so far both just seem heavily interested in providing fan service.There's an endless supply of Pokemon characters in this movie, from Psyduck to MewToo, most come in for a quirky laugh, others so they can fight each other. I guess this is fun for avid game players. As filmmaking it's pretty one-dimensional.This movie starts out as detective fiction. It even uses a clip from that movie Kevin watches in Home Alone to show you exactly what it's going for.That's ironic considering that movie doesn't really exist and the detective yarn this movie tries to set up proves equally hollow come second half.This movie is getting compared to Blade Runner but only in that it's just another movie to glom on to that movie's neon chinatown aesthetic.Pikachu seems much more comfortable with underground pokemon battles, the big finale battle, and a fantastic effects-driven chase during an Earthquake and it's fans will probably appreciate both those things much more too.Just that doesn't leave much room for plot which is pretty dull. The villains are easy to spot and i'm not exactly sure I even understood their entire plan.Overall Smith and Reynold's work great together, the effects work are fun and sometimes even stunning, and this is definitely a movie for Pokemon fans.Just I think it's a little too simplistic for anyone not already in love with the video game in the first place.",Pokémon Detective Pikachu
176,rarepeperonis,That was alright i guess....,6,27 July 2019,Big pokemon fan was super excited for this movie but the plot is very weak and it's like they had an idea for a 4 hour pokemon movie but they coudn't do that so they took all those ideas and squeezed then into 2 hours the plot moves way too fast. The effects are ok i guess. The actors are terrible especially the main guy Justice something. Pikachu barely use his powers through the first and second act... very dissapointed.,Pokémon Detective Pikachu
177,CriticalOfEverything,"The best video game adaptation to date, unfortunately that's still not saying too much.",6,16 May 2019,"OK, so I actually enjoyed Detective Pikachu. In fact, I enjoyed it quite a bit as a Pokemon fan. And yes, this is probably the best video game adaptation to date because it's made by people who actually care and respect the source material. I thought quite a few of the jokes were landing but some definitely did fall flat and the movie is kind of predictable, but going into this I expected it to suck. I had no idea why everyone was saying that this movie was going to break the video game movie curse. Now I can definitely see why, but at the same time, being the best video game adaptation doesn't mean ""good"". It's pretty decent, but it isn't good. The acting for the human characters was very stiff, the soundtrack was pretty flat and some of the comedy was just straight up juvenile. That being said, casting Ryan Reynolds as Detective Pikachu was a great choice and it's actually surprising how much he carries this film. I've heard quite a few people complain about the Pokemon designs, and yeah I can definitely see why. Some of them are straight up bad, but the majority of them were either passable or legitimately good and sometimes actually cute like in the case of Pikachu and Jigglypuff. So yeah, Detective Pikachu was an enjoyable film, definitely surpassed my expectations, but there were a few too many things wrong with it for it to cross the line of being truly great. I'd probably recommend this movie to Pokemon fans but casual moviegoers can probably get some sort of enjoyment out of it.",Pokémon Detective Pikachu
178,valen060,Quite A Shift In the Nature of The Franchise,8,14 May 2019,"Since 1999, the Pokémon craze swept through many parts of the world outside Japan, including an impact on America. I was one of those kids that year who enjoyed the video games, the TV show, its first movie (where my local theater back then was packed with fanatics sporting the merchandise and holding Game Boys), and even collected some stuffed toys. Now as an adult, for this to cross into the live-action realm with a dark tone compared to what I've known? I was left curiouser by the minute of what this will be about after knowing this franchise for so long.I understand Detective Pikachu derived from the spinoff video game of the same name, but seeing how it plays out with star Ryan Reynold's voicing the yellow pint-sized, talking sleuth was something I did not expect for him to do next outside his Deadpool persona. His costar Tim Goodman (played by Justice Smith) is the reluctant hero who has to take on the case of helping Pikachu recover his lost memories and solve his own mystery at the same time.Although hesitant at first on the creatures' look, their CGI rendering is pretty uncanny that it makes the world they live in look inviting and believable. Tim tries his best to get along with Pikachu that it gets to the point of irritating and annoying for him. This partnership and mystery setting of this movie mirrors that of another live action-animated film known as Who Framed Roger Rabbit. How? Aside from the mystery theme, the two characters are at odds with each other, but there's more to one another than being a hindrance or nuisance. Like there's potential in what these opposites can do than they initially started off as. Compared to past Pokémon animated films I've watched in theaters back in the late 90s to early 2000s that were based on the TV show, it looks like the filmmakers here were trying to emulate this piece by blurring the line between ""video game"" and ""movie."" There was also a connection in this film's story to that of one particular Pokémon movie I remembered years back which I did not expect. As though it's now forging a wider universe.In the end, I found it amusing and worth a shot in seeing what this can do for audiences who are more familiar with the character Pikachu, much less on the Pokémon universe altogether. It was a nice touch to show a tribute to the classic Game Boy game toward the end and having Ryan Reynolds sing the theme song was pretty laughable. Sure, the story feels derivative, but Detective Pikachu is unique for it to find its own footing.",Pokémon Detective Pikachu
179,gacsogergely,Crappy Pokemon Go adaptation,1,16 May 2019,"This has nothing to do with the games, or the anime. Actualy, pokemon battles are illegal in this film. And you don't have to weaken pokemons, just throw there a ball like in Pokemon Go.
There's almost nothing happening for most of the times, we're just watching empty streets for padding.
The story of course is cliche, and very very predictable: the black guy and the WOman fights the rich white man. Because PC-culture.Just avoid this. They don't even give Ryan Reynolds things to work with.",Pokémon Detective Pikachu
180,El-Ak,A poor film indeed!,5,22 June 2019,"Poor acting of everybody as I expected since I saw Justice Smith in Jurassic World 2 and I realised how poor he is at acting. Poor story, poor score for the film, poor scenario and most importantly poor voice of Ryan Reynolds as Pikachu and at some point poor VFX even when Smith holds Pikachu you feel that something is wrong. Porr direction for the film with the poor story with it's predictable plots from the beginning and it's poor editing and even Pikachu's powers weren't used most of the film and you can't get out of this film satisfied. Don't waste time watching it and don't listen to stupid Rotten Tomatoes. 4.5/10 for the good VFX at least and the effort of creating some good tricks in the Pokemon world.",Pokémon Detective Pikachu
181,ajzeg,"This movie was pretty stupid, but I didn't have a bad time watching it.",6,15 September 2019,"I'm going to say right away that this is not a very good movie. It's not well written or well acted, the cinematography and action weren't anything special, most of the comedy fell pretty flat and the story just doesn't make a lot of sense. However, this movie is awesome and worth seeing because of one thing: the Pokémon. There are Pokémon everywhere in this movie and they are delightful! They're really well animated and you get a good variety of Pokémon from every generation. Every scene is jam-packed with detail and easter eggs. Chances are you'll see your favourite Pokémon somewhere in this movie, no matter which generation you grew up with. Overall, this movie is okay. I'd recommend it only if you are a fan of Pokémon, even if you are just a casual fan or haven't really been into it for a long time like me. If you like Pokémon, you'll like this. If you aren't a Pokémon fan, however, I have a feeling that this movie will just bore and confuse you. It does not explain anything about what a Pokémon is or how this world works. It just assumes that you already know coming in, which could be an issue for some. Instead, watch Zootopia, a much better movie with a similar story, universe and character dynamics. Well, we did it everyone! We finally got an okay video game movie! Now we just need a good one! It'll get made someday, I know it!",Pokémon Detective Pikachu
182,Benslie,A good movie for fans of the series,7,12 May 2019,"First of all, the pacing in this film is really off throughout the entire movie. This movie in one hour and forty-five minutes but really it feels like a two and a half hour long film. This is due to for a majority of the film it felt really slow and that it needed to pick up the pace. This leads to a very quick paced climax for the film. It felt as if they realized that this film was going on too long and had to quickly wrap it. So while you're watching the ending it leads to everything happening at rapid speed. If the film took it's time and organized itself a bit better than it would've made for a more enjoyable film. Obviously, I'm going to mention how great the Pokémon look. I mean seriously this movie went all out on them. Each one looked like it was taken straight out of the game and or anime and into our world. Usually, this leads to terrible CGI where it looks like a cartoon or that it isn't there but for this case, it actually worked. I love Ryan Reynolds as Pikachu and he was definitely a stand out for this film. He brought all of the humour in this film and it was great. The other actors did great jobs having the tough job of interacting with CGI creatures all day. I do love the humour in this movie because it's a perfect balance of jokes for kids and some for the adults in the audience. This helps because the adults who were dragged to see this movie can enjoy those jokes. Honestly, I know this is a very teeny tiny spoiler thing but there are two plot twists that if you pay attention you can easily figure out. The last thing I want to mention is the music in this film. Henry Jackman, the composer for this film, did an excellent job on the music. In the end, this film is good for people who either just want a fun movie or are casual fans of Pokémon but really this film is for the hardcore fans of Pokémon. I give Pokémon Detective Pikachu a 7.5/10.",Pokémon Detective Pikachu

184,jackson_ro,Pokémon Detective Pikachu,6,11 May 2019,"Perhaps halfway through the film I realize how big of an undertaking Detective Pikachu is. It has the near impossible task of balancing itself to be suitable to hardcore long term Pokémon fans like myself who are highly critical of almost everything Pokémon related, as well as newcomers to the series who are perhaps younger and requires a more PG story. I'd say the film strikes a good balance in this regard; but the it also makes the film a little light on a true identity and less memorable as a whole. It is definitely cool to see Pokémon in a more realistic setting, and the first scene with Cubone definitely reminds me of myself when I was younger and just imagining if Pokémon were real and how I would go about catching my own. At the end of the day, I hope The Pokémon Company and Legendary would continue this endeavor, for me, more authentic Pokémon products and stories are always good, and always bring me back to better times. I have no gripes with the film, as the quality is less important for me, just seeing them in action is enough for me.",Pokémon Detective Pikachu
185,shimenpf,A very worthy representation of the franchise,7,5 January 2020,"Detective Pikachu is a pretty good film. It delivers in successfully showing how Pokemon and humans would interact in the real world, the designs are great.
The plot works. Even though I'm not a big fan of so many recurring flashbacks and exposition, specially in the first half, the story manages to compensate with its action, humor, and engaging situations the heroes are tossed into. I also liked that they were brave in their third act with Pokemons and humans becoming into one, which is a mixture of weird and compelling. That last twist of Pikachu being the father all along is also fulfilling.
I really appreciate the writers and producers not settling for a flat, average story, and daring to take risks instead. The movie was definitely worth the watch!",Pokémon Detective Pikachu
186,TheMysteriousReviewer,A Fun Mystery Pokémon Movie,8,12 March 2021,"Detective Pikachu is a really enjoyable Pokémon movie. Well, not perfect. Because there are some issues like the movie can sometimes get predictable and the characters are kinda generic. But it really makes up those issues thanks to an enjoyable story that's about Tim Goodman solving the mystery to find out what happened to his father. It does have heart into it. The action moments make the movie exciting. Ryan Reynolds plays a great and funny performance as Picachu. And the visuals are absolutely incredible that brings Pokémon to life. Because of it, of course Pokémon fans are going to enjoy it. This also is worth a watch for those that want to see a good movie based on a video game. It may not be perfect, but I would definitely say this is one of the better movies based on a video game.",Pokémon Detective Pikachu
187,Aries_Primal,Mediocre movie with a lot of effects,3,20 January 2021,"Poor, so poor. I watched because Ryan Reinolds was dubbing Pikachu, never been fan of pokemons. They madethem cool, but the entire movie was so poor and out of logic, absolutely predictible.SPOILER!
The girl and the boy without father who would fall in love with her, of course.
The god-alike pokemon who could kill and resurrect, move souls in other creatures bodies, the evil rich man and the fight in which nobody died...
How the boy was hanging through the broken winfow and doesn't even scratched his arms? Nobody could break a glass withouth leaving sharp shards.
How the entire team of evil rich guy was made of incredible beautiful young women?Well I liked the scene with the giant turtles, it was well planned.Other things were poor. Bad made american version of Japan, very bad!

The film would have done better with different main star.",Pokémon Detective Pikachu
189,antony-1,As a non-Pokémon fan I really enjoyed it,7,10 November 2019,"I've never seen or played anything in the Pokémon universe. That makes me a clean slate, and perhaps lower expectations. But what a fun movie!It was delightfully funny, but not over the top. This isn't a movie that aims for humour constantly to beat you over the head with it. Pikachu gets the most laughs (his moment in the back of a car being the higlight) and there are many other nice moments such as the mime Pokémon. A lot of humour is subtle, like the absurdity of Pikachu atop a massive inflatable Pikachu. This level of humour may not appeal to everyone, but it appeals to me.I particularly like the world that they create... it feels vivid. I get a sense of a rich world that is well thought out and plenty to delve into. The creatures and humans living together was particularly well realised in a pseudo-London.It reminded me a lot of the movies I watched as a kid. The bad guy is a clear, uncomplicated bad guy. The forces of good will prevail. There's a certain satisfaction in that, even if it's a well trod path.All in I reallly enjoyed it - a fun, funny engaging movie.",Pokémon Detective Pikachu

I've never been a huge fan of Pokémon or a fan in general, but that doesn't mean that i never heard of it or don't know about it at all. I've seen some episodes of the anime when i was a kid, but i was still not into it, since there were other things that i preferred more or i was interested in (Yu-Gi-Oh! being one of them) and after hearing that there will be a live-action adaptation of the franchise, i didn't had any expectations and didn't know if i should watch it or not.As a film lover, i want to see as many films as i can, so I decided to give it a chance. After learning that Rob Letterman was hired as a director / writer and seeing his filmography, i was certain that the film will not be good (or should i say ""bad""), but i was still positive about it, but after having the chance of seeing it: i feel emptiness from it and i didn't know what to think at first.There are many problems that i have with it like the way they executed the story feels generic and people will probably predict many things that will happen in the film, especially the twist that happens in the third act; the characters are not interesting; the dialogue is bad; the acting ranges from OK to almost bad; the music is forgettable; the visual effects are fake and disturbing at the same time, with many of the Pokémon creatures have a very ugly design (except Pikachu), especially Mewtwo, who probably has the worst design out of all of them and for some reason they gave him teeth, which makes him look very creepy as hell and the cinematography is fine.Overall Pokémon Detective Pikachu is a film that is made for the longtime fans of the franchise. If you are one of them, then you'll probably find enjoyment out of it, but for many people, who are not invested into the franchise, will find the film boring and uninteresting.",Pokémon Detective Pikachu

All he does is yell or scream in place of range and talent, he is even worse here than he was in Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom.However, let's talk about the film itself. Despite excellent CGI, and enthusiastic and high energy voicework from Ryan Reynolds, Pokemon Detective Pikachu suffers from an unfunny script, predictability, bland cinematography and camerawork, forgettable performances, a cut and paste story straight from Zootopia, a lack of excitement and zero fun.

The game is very dull to say the least, the adaption to the screen however was good. The highlight would have to be the amazing visuals. Pikachu looked incredible with his free flowing fur as did the rest of the Pokemon. The storytelling was also a plus, now I didn't find myself getting invested too heavily in the plot until about half way through. Honestly that opening scene could have just been scraped as it didn't add any emotional connection to the male lead. Speaking of the lead, he really didn't do it for me. He couldn't seem to give convincing emotional performance when it mattered. I about had the same reaction for the female lead when the film started but she and her adorable Psyduck grew on me. Obviously the star of the movie is Reynolds who gives us another great comedic performance. All the jokes were timed well and always hit.This isn't the greatest Pokemon movie ever, but I can say you will enjoy your time watching.

Ryan Reynolds as the voice actor for Pikachu helps a lot on the movie as the source of the funny elements and I'd like to point out that Pokémons are well modelled, good work on animations. Story is acceptable, not too over the top or dark- it's a movie for kids, so expect it not to be too deep, just silly fun (which is a good thing). I sort of find the plot actually unique, though. All in all, not bad for a live action film. A solid 3 stars, but I'll happily give it another half for a bit of nostalgia and cuteness.

209,rustonreviews,Fun yet forgettable.,6,19 May 2019,"Pokémon is ingrained in 90's pop culture. I vividly remember the trading card game as a kid and have fond memories of the original trilogy, most notably Pokémon: The First Movie (1998), but the plethora of video games and sprawling anime adventures slipped under my radar entirely. Pokémon's immense popularity doesn't appear to be diminishing anytime soon either. Detective Pikachu, based upon the video game of the same name, follows Tim Goodman (Smith), who strives to learn the undetermined fate of his missing father. Whilst visiting Ryme City, a peaceful utopia in which humans and Pokémon live in harmony, Tim crosses paths with Detective Pikachu, resulting in a team up to unravel the secrets surrounding his father's disappearance. Whilst far from perfect, Detective Pikachu is a perfectly fine yet messy adventure. Ryan Reynolds keeps the film afloat with an enjoyable portrayal of the adorable Pikachu, just about salvaging the film from a rather convoluted storyline with uninteresting characters and a ridiculous plot twist that fails to stick the landing towards the end of an anticlimactic finale. But the true stars of the film are undoubtably the Pokémon themselves. They're brilliantly brought to life with some pretty impressive CGI, and for the most part, the Pokémon (mainly featuring the classic characters) are utilized quite well. Detective Pikachu is a fun if not pretty forgettable adventure, catered solely for die hard fans of Pokémon, and that's no bad thing at all.",Pokémon Detective Pikachu
210,andrewburgereviews,PSYDUCK!!,6,19 August 2019,"It's a freakin' Pokémon-inspired movie, what clever title you want me to give? Nonetheless, ""Detective Pikachu"" succeeds at the most important thing for its financial well being and eventual surviving--fulfilling the fantasy. So, if you're a Pokémon fan you needn't read any further. If you're a hardcore Pokémon fan though, I cannot help you here. Just know that as far as the visual recreation go, this is pretty decent.Decent, yet not perfect. The visual effects are not terrible, yet you can see corners were cut. This is targeted mostly at children who will not bother with looking in detail, yet despite the fur on Pikachu looking almost palpable, if you take a closer look you can almost feel is just textured. Among the scenes in which he is caressed you can see the hairs not responding physically. Sure, I might be pedantic, but between The Avengers and Planet of the Apes, Hollywood set the standards pretty high. The slob-job is the most visible on Mewtwo because he is not furry. Don't get me wrong, the effects are not bad by any way, I particularly enjoyed Psyduck--he so cute!But enough about the technicalities. Is it any good to watch on an artistic level? Well, know that while the plot is pretty standard stuff, it is sustained by Ryan Reynolds' great performance as the voice of Pikachu. The fact that he is not understood by anyone in the movie except his partner Tim (Justice Smith) simulates a consequence-free Twitter allowing him to get clever whenever and with whoever he likes. Think of him like a PG-13 Deadpool. Still, while he and Tim have great chemistry, the rest of the supporting cast, including the villain, seem banal but, well, you kinda expect this. The movie does contain a pretty clever and unexpected twist which surprised me--unlikely in a movie like this.An example of the problem lies with the first time Tim meets up-and-coming reporter Lucy Stevens (Kathryn Newton). She almost plays like a caricature of herself. I assume director Rob Letterman wanted her to be a bit silly, yet she is too silly here. Overall, though, this improves as the movie goes on and Reynolds' comments are not always strictly childish. After an intense cataclysmic action scene he comments: ""How can you not believe in climate change?""In the end, ""Pokémon Detective Pikachu"" not only did not disappoint me (well, my expectations were not high), it also slightly surprised me at times. But its biggest and only true success was that by the time I finished watching it, I did not find it as ridiculous as I thought it would be. I should set low standards for movies more often.",Pokémon Detective Pikachu
211,Abranth-d,Pikaaaachu !!!!,7,19 July 2019,"Here's my review of Detective Pikachu. So Det. Pikachu stars Ryan Reynolds voicing Pikachu and he was amazing , I don't think any other actor could've pulled it off in a way that it matches with the cgi character's actions. Since Deadpool everything he's played is a wisecracking dude , that is he's played himself in all his characters and Pikachu is no exception . The story is a very linear mystery , something out of a Detective Conan story but PG13 , I liked how this was not a Pokemon fan service movie , which means you don't need to know your way around Pokemon to watch this movie , it's exactly like what the Entourage movie did , you don't need to watch the whole TV show run , they even give you a little heads up into the world if you're a newcomer at the start. I've always been a fan of cgi characters and humans interacting with each other since Space Jam . Like the title says it's a detective / mystery movie with Pikachu in it ,but like most in the genre , the movie has this cliche where you expect someone to be the bad guy but the writers make the person who you'd least expect as the bad guy , and it was quite obvious at the beginning itself . But the ending twist , I did not see that coming and even had a man tear or two . I can go and say this is by far the successful Japanese cartoon that Hollywood has adapted . If this movie had Ash , brock , Team rocket and such this movie would've turned out like Netflix's Death Note or even Dragon ball evolution at the worst. In the end , Detective Pikachu has adorable characters , a predictable but linear story , amazing voice acting , a nice touch at humour and the best marketing campaign Pikachu stuffed dolls have had.",Pokémon Detective Pikachu

213,Lost_In_Translation_,"Great world building, average Hollywood plot and humor",6,15 May 2019,"I've been a Pokémon fan since the original Game Boy games came out. I was just the right age for Poke-mania. It was everywhere and everyone was into it. I'm still a fan of it in my older age, despite the games repeating the same formula and really becoming boring.I wasn't crazed to see this movie as honestly the trailers made it look awful. I am happy to say that it isn't awful, just a hugely average movie.The strongest suit of this movie is the Pokémon. The artists, cinematographer, set designers all did a fantastic job in making this world come to life. Ryme City felt like exactly what a real life Pokémon world would feel like in reality. The designs of the Pokémon, for the most part, are fantastically realized and look great. The Pokémon and world building are definitely a feat that they succeed in superbly, it's just a shame that it is all wasted on a super generic Hollywood plot.It does for sure feel like a movie made with the ""Hollywood Crowd Pleaser-3000"" machine. Don't get me wrong, there are plenty of crowd-pleaser movies that are fantastic, i.e. Marvel Studios. But with Marvel, they still do a fantastic job with characters and changing it up a bit to keep everything fresh.The story in Detective Pikachu just lacked any of that. The human characters were borderline annoying and the mystery was not that interesting and had a super obvious schemer behind it. The finale battle just really gets a bit too unreal for me, even for a movie about fictional creatures with amazing powers. It's a script made to appeal to the average movie-goer, nothing that is deep or as intricate as the best that Marvel Studios has given us.Pokémon Detective Pikachu is a serviceable movie that has strong production behind it. Not bad, but not fantastic. It's enjoyable to see your childhood video game brought to life, but don't go in expecting anything unique as far as storytelling goes. If this one does well enough, I'd love to see some better written adventures in this world!",Pokémon Detective Pikachu

215,manigarg0000,It is a stupid movie.,6,28 January 2021,I did not like this movie. The acting and story was average. I gave this much stars only because of it's animation and some of the funny dialogues but overall it is an average movie with bad casting and bad plot.,Pokémon Detective Pikachu

The plot is not interesting either.

217,mc1382,Actually.....Good?,8,12 May 2019,"Honestly a lot better than I expected. Even though the film is fantastical it feels very grounded and I think that's because the character development in the human and Pokémon characters alike go beyond the call of duty. Tim starts in a very unlikable state but as the film went on I was compelled by his backstory. The story followed established adventure tropes for sure but the execution felt more organic than your average adventure film. It was engaging enough that it made me forgive most of those story beats. Another thing that salvaged this thing was the chemistry between Tim and Pikachu.They play off each other quite well and you feel like both learn from each other and improve throughout the film. I'm actually surprised of the amount of adult jokes they were able to slip into a PG rated film. Surprisingly more jokes hit than miss, but the jokes that do miss really miss...hard. The second half of this film is a little weaker as the film goes a bit more action, had a story beat that i'm tired of seeing and becomes a bit exposition heavy. Which is fine but the film becomes a bit silly and loses a little of that emotional core. Luckily the last 15 minutes brings that back in spades with a twist that didn't exist for the shock factor and played into the emotional heart of the film.If you were disappointed coming out of this I totally get it but I can't deny how much of a good time I had with this. Eager to rewatch and I can't say that for Endgame, yeah I said it, sue me.",Pokémon Detective Pikachu
218,castoirebenjamin,Not great but not bad.,5,24 May 2019,"It was an ok movie for me, the kids enjoyed it a lot. The acting wasn't great, the storyline was subpar and the CGI was very good. The storyline was what killed it for me.",Pokémon Detective Pikachu
219,Ashcropolis,Video game movie curse is broken,9,14 May 2019,"I thought Tomb raider was okay, but with Detective Pikachu, I can unapologetically say that we finally have a good Video game movie,
The movie is at its best whenever Reynold's Pikachu is on screen, it's beautifully shot, the neon lighting throughout the film is pleasing as hell, it's just a treat to watch, and the human characters surprisingly aren't bad to watch either, Justice smith as Tom Goodman is a actually a very well written character and someone you care about which is all I can ask for. The Pokémon creature designs and cgi are some of the best iv ever seen in film history, the photorealism works so well and after watching this you'll wish you had your own Pokémon. The movie although loses its steam around this beginning of the 3rd act, where there's this OVERLY long and boring sequence of them being on top of a Mountain Sequence, I really really wish they would've cut that down, that's mainly the biggest flaw in the film. And I don't know if I was just distracted by all the cute Pokémon's, but I didn't find the twist predictable like a lot of people are saying. Either way this Noir Blockbuster is a treat to watch on screen and I can't wait to see this franchise grow.",Pokémon Detective Pikachu

Psyduck hands down the best character besides Pika!",Pokémon Detective Pikachu
221,nlgthunder,Cute and funny,7,23 January 2021,"Ryan Reynolds really delivers and takes it to another level. The storyline was exactly what I expected and the animation was outstanding. It was a bit corny and juvenile, and sometimes I think filmmakers underestimate the ability of younger kids to watch higher level movies and still enjoy it. They could have elevated the script to make it a bit better for adults while still keeping the younger audience engaged. But I found it cute, touching, and I laughed out loud. Certainly not a bad movie!",Pokémon Detective Pikachu
222,Scarefish,Pokeyman: Detective Pikachu in the shower.,3,16 May 2019,"This movie, right from when they step foot in the city, is a Zootopia ripoff, having many of the same shots and gags, and even a similar setup except they're detectives instead of police officers this time around. Zootopia, however, was much, much better.A lot of this films issues come from inappropriately hiring talented individuals who don't fit with the themes of Pokemon. RJ Palmer is a talented artist who managed to make incredibly realistic (and creepy) looking Pokemon back in the day, and somehow some people thought it would be a good idea to hire him to do the art for the first live-action Pokemon film and to make the vast majority of the Pokemon look creepy and unsettling. This is coupled with John Mathieson, cinematographer of Gladiator and Logan, who did an excellent job for those movies but is horribly out of his element for a Pokemon movie. What we get is numerous poorly lit scenes and a dark vibe that counters the light-hearted nature of the script. Mathieson went as far as to say the reason Detective Pikachu is so much better than Sonic the Hedgehog is because it was shot on film, as it makes it easier to make the Pokemon look like they belong in the world, which shows he really can't see the forest for the trees. Hey Mathieson, next time you want to brag about cinematography, maybe next time you could start with the lighting.Some of the Pokemon looked surprisingly okay while others looked awful. Pikachu looked just about perfect, which shows they at least had some of their priorities in order. Mr. Mime was surprisingly good in this movie as well, considering he's one of my least favorite Pokemon from the first generation. Bulbasaur looks fairly accurate to the cartoony design, and Psyduck looks proper. The worst design by far has to be Charizard, as his scales are way too big in his model and look more like scars than a lizard's scaly body. If the scales were simply smaller, they would have given him a bit more of a sleek look which would have been in line with the cartoony character design we recognize. Gengar was another uncanny one, though only appeared for a few seconds anyways. Jigglypuff somehow goes from being the cutest Pokemon to being the creepiest in this rendition, and Greninja looks downright horrific, which may have been in part to play along with the nods to Alien when they're introduced. The scaling is all wrong, as an Eevee evolves into a Flareon and both are the same size despite Flareon being canonically about double the size of Eevee.The dialogue is surprisingly good, especially from Ryan Reynolds. It feels like a PG Deadpool at times, along with a couple of jokes which may be a tad inappropriate for a kids' movie, such as one moment where Pikachu alludes to not being the kind of Pokemon that invites strangers to their apartment at night, or Justice Smith saying ""Oh sh-..."" Mr. Mime is the best thing about the movie, but unfortunately most of his moments are shown in the trailer, as are most of the other funny jokes in the movie. One additional funny scene involves the revelation that the cool quiet chick with the sunglasses was using said sunglasses to cover her beady Ditto eyes, which is also incredibly creepy, mind you.The story is abysmal. There's a double-twist which is incredibly predictable and there's a lot of undoing plot elements as soon as they're revealed. So Ryan Reynolds is the kid's dad and was in Pikachu the whole time because Pikachu survived the car crash and Mewtwo put Ryan Reynolds' mind into the Pikachu with consent. And then Mewtwo revives Ryan Reynolds at the end of the movie. Why didn't he just do that from the start? What a coy jerk. Also, evil businessman isn't actually evil, but actually is. Come up with something original, guys. There's a scene where Pikachu kinda dies when a giant boulder misses him, but a tiny pebble from it breaks off and donks him on the head, and it is hilarious, but then the characters are weeping over Pikachu's corpse for five minutes until God-Mewtwo revives Pikachu. It's bizarre and it goes on too long and they've done this in every Pokemon movie to date.All in all, this film's a masterpiece compared to other Pokemon films, but as its own movie it falls flat in numerous places and without the nostalgia goggles there's not too much to enjoy this movie for. If you set the bar very low you'll be blown away, but if you expect to be blown away you'll be greatly disappointed.",Pokémon Detective Pikachu

The story and screenplay was just smooth enough to keep me interested.

Naturally, I was at a loss with all the newer ones that are featured more prominently but they do give justice to a lot of those classic ones. With that said, if you came solely for the Pokes then you wouldn't be disappointed. They are absolutely adorable, if you've never had a wish for them to be real then you certainly would now!The movie itself is a lot of fun, consisting mainly of interactions between the various Pokemon. There are moments where it seems to drag a little, and some scenes were unnecessary. Being that this isn't a movie about battling, you may be disappointed in not seeing many flashy moves being thrown about, which would've been simply amazing to see. Ryan Reynolds is a natural Pikachu, but I felt the shtick got tiresome at times. The humans varied from alright to ""Next scene, please!""Overall, it's a great movie but only recommended for fans. If you don't know the difference between a Charmander and an Eevee, then you won't get much enjoyment.",Pokémon Detective Pikachu
236,Liam3011,"An Entertaining Movie, But Cliché With it's Story",6,10 June 2019,"First of all, I know it's a kids movie. Kids will enjoy this movie, without a shadow of a doubt. If you have kids, take them to see this movie, they will love it!Second of all, I got what I wanted from the movie. It was entertaining and that's what I wanted from it. But that isn't to say that, as a movie, it isn't without issues. The excuse ""it's just a kids movie"" can only go so far. The story was extremely predictable, and the twists were not surprising. It's a plot that has been used a lot of times before - the actual story isn't mind blowing.The acting isn't great. Ryan Reynolds was great, but everyone else in the movie were not great. They had their moments but, for the most part, the acting was very underwhelming. Some of the decision making in this movie was extremely questionable too. It felt as if the characters lacked common sense in some situations.The CGI in this movie is also very hit and miss itself. In some cases the CGI is fantastic and really well done, while at other times it looks poor and unpolished. Some of the Pokemon in this movie also look pretty terrifying, but for the most part the Pokemon look pretty good.The action sequences are pretty entertaining and then humour and chemistry between the characters, minus the decision making and some of the acting, is actually really nice and flows well.Ryan Reynolds also works a lot better as Pikachu than I actually expected. I thought he fit the character well and made Pikachu come across as funny and adorable.Despite it's flaws, I had a lot of fun with the movie. If the issues were ironed out, the movie could easily be an 8/10 at least. But because of it's issues it's a 6/10.

237,Hongwaree_Raitao,Adorable Pikachu and and that's that.,5,15 May 2019,"Detective Pikachu starts out with a great deal, but then the story turns into a weird thing, that is actually not interesting. The screenplay has a lot of flaws and it's poor. It's a shame how they choose the most simple ideas to solve the problems the story develops. Dialogues are not great either excepting for the ones from Pikachu. Another horrible department was photography, cause they made it so dark times. Now the good thing is they made Pikachu adorable as hell, and he is just awesome. And Mewtwo rocks too. His dialogues are super fun and Ryan Reynolds deliver. Downside is, they didn't put the same effort on the rest of the pokémons. And to make it worse, there is a lack of variety of pokémons in the movie. Detective Pikachu is a decent movie, and Pikachu is awesome, but the horrible cast, the unnecesary scenes, the atrociuos perform by almost everybody(specially the one who portrays Lucy Stevens, seriuosly, where are they pickin' them from) really ruins the movie.",Pokémon Detective Pikachu

But I do have seen and enjoyed a few episodes of the series and got to like some of the wide list of characters that play a role on it. So, having said that, I will start with my review.Here we have the first live action adaptation to the big screen of Pokémon. Loved by many, hated by other many, including the critics, for me it is a movie that provides funny moments and that for the most part stays true to the escence of the characters that are present in the film, which obviously aren't everyone, but still were good enough.The new conception of Pikachu that this movie shows worked out pretty good for me, as well as the voice acting of Ryan Reynolds, which was really funny and cute, and always kept the charismatic style that we well know from him.In my opinion, it is totally watchable, and provides pop corn entertainment for everyone. The only reason I have for giving it a 7 is because the writing and the performances aren't great and it gets a little slow at the last minutes. But I still recommend it. If you're a fan, you should, instead of listening to the bad opinions see this for yourself so you decide if it is faithfully adapted or not.Peace!",Pokémon Detective Pikachu

241,RuriGokou,Where is Danny DeVito?,4,17 January 2021,"This movie was disappointing. I was expecting some fun filled adventure about a detective pikachu and his owner. Instead this movie was kinda cringe with a bit of nostalgia. The pokemon looked pretty cool, but the plot just didn't work well for the Pokemon universe. It was hard to follow and some points were just thrown out entirety. They had a lot they could of done from the games and anime to work with, but instead they just rip off Zootopia and a lot of other common cliches.The movie was just so boring after 30 minutes. It felt like some kind of fan made film than this theatrical release. Also, what is with these movies now where you have a black guy and a white girl pair as the leads? I didn't even like the black kid's acting. He looked totally bored. Always frowning. It seemed like he didn't want to be there the whole time. It ruined the experience honestly. The girl was more outgoing and confident than the guy. Did we need the forced romance between them? And the only white males are the bad guys or incompetent. What's new? This is the woke and diverse Hollywood. I'm just starting to watch more movies past 2017 and it's just starting to get worse and obvious. The way they revealed the black kid's dad obviously was done in a way to shock you by his skin color. Honestly, I wasn't expecting him to be white, but I should have figured since this movie just shoves the diversity kool-aid down our throats.I didn't have a problem with the pikachu's voice, but the stuff he said was hit or miss, and just didn't work well with the mopey black kid. Wish it was Danny DeVito doing the voice instead. Overall for a movie about Pokemon it really wasn't all that about pokemon.

Just no (at least for me).SPOILERS BELOW:Movie has pretty big WTF scene somewhere in the middle of the movie. Where our protagonist learns something he shouldn't have, simply because there's no way for anyone to record it in any way. Namely the hologram of his father abduction. This is the kindergarten level of bad writing.The ""underground arena"" where pokemons fight with each other. If anyone of you has paid some attention it's not really hard to see it's a silly scene. Pokemon fights walled off by cheap wire-walls you see on construction site. Yeah sure, those will definitely protect you so good against blastoise water blast. The whole fight is located in the room right by the exit on a very busy street (which wouldn't be that bad... Oh wait, pokemons fights are illegal). I mean, has anyone bothered thinking about it?Characters are goofy, most likely cause they were designed to be likeable for kids. Jokes are mostly a miss, Sorry Ryan.

247,Andy_MJD,I'm so happy this film exists!,10,4 February 2020,"A spectacular movie. The inclusion of Pokémon anywhere from Gen 1 to (at least) 5 (B&W). The visual effects are absolutely stunning, and each Pokémon has such care put into their design, animation, and sound that they feel like plausible animals. The storyline was fine, enough to carry the narrative, the characters, and the feels, the world, and the humour. I guess the ending rules out any possibility of a sequel, despite making nearly 3 times its budget at the box office. Molly Freeman from ScreenRant echoes my thoughts: ""In a movie about Pokémon, though, the story isn't necessarily the biggest draw. It needs to be solid enough to carry viewers through this larger world and, in that regard, Detective Pikachu is a success. The story may not be Detective Pikachu's biggest strength, but it does complement the world well, giving the movie an avenue through which its viewers can explore Ryme City and the larger universe. It's in the world-building that Detective Pikachu truly shines..."". While I feel that the acting is less than spectacular, notably from side characters like the love interest, whose name I already forget (Lucy Stevens by Kathryn Newton), Ryan Renold's Pikachu and Justice Smith's Tim Goodman were enough to carry the story far (props to Bill Nighy's character in the wheelchair). Overall a very, very, very fun movie that I would want to see again almost just to catch all the Pokémon they included in the backgrounds, simply because this world is immense and breathtaking. And yeah, I totally teared up at the end, no shame.",Pokémon Detective Pikachu
248,HardLight,Life-like character models are not able to hold this movie up,5,27 February 2020,"Detective Pikachu has a hokey plot but that can work when you have the right cast around you, and while Ryan Renolds does a good job as the VA for the titular Pikachu, everyone else is either phoning it in or just abysmally bad.
I cringed at every forced smile, ever bit of stinted acting and desperately bad dialogue.The story is the usual fare for a Hollywood led movie about a niche market, it knows that there are iconic names, symbols and phrases that the fandom will see and say ""Hay, sounds cool!"" and they use it to try and trick the gullible in to watch it. Take the ""Agent R"" plot device, they know that the anime and the game has people with R on them, but rather than write something that includes the criminal organisation Team Rocket, maybe include that this movie is taking place at the same time as the Red/Blue game and THIS is where Giovanni was when you tried to enter the Viriddian Gym. But no...they had to make this a fully original plot with a ""tortured antagonist"" main bad guy who just wants to walk again.The main positives is that the CGI is on point to such a perfectly stellar degree that many will give it a higher marking for it, because the effects are that good, taking the 2d cell shaded designs of the anime or the sprites of the game and making them look like their counterparts while having a real world aesthetic to it.
But like I said, life-like character models are not able to hold this movie up.For another entry to the ""oh god no"" of video game movies, this came at just the wrong time, combining bad acting, directing, editing and writing to make yet another mistake when Hollywood tried to convert something video game into a movie",Pokémon Detective Pikachu

252,thetyvonlesure,Fun Film with a Great Message,7,16 June 2019,"Detective Pikachu is a great movie for the family. The movie is introductory level film noir. The plot is unpredictable and well paced. The world of Pokémon is one that many will want to venture into after watching the film. Ryan Reynolds does a great job as Pikachu, while Justice Smith continues to display his skill as a solid up-and-coming actor. The cinematography is well done, despite some noticeable missteps in terms of the CGI. The setting is immense, and there's always something to look at in this world. Genuine diversity plays a core role to this film, as it is the overall message/theme. Overall, this is a fun movie for adults and kids alike. Highly recommended to all Pokémon fans and open minded individuals.",Pokémon Detective Pikachu
253,yahiaaqil,Dreadful!,3,6 July 2020,"Pikachu is a very old character that many generations grew up watching. It's very important and iconic for a lot of people. It's not SpongeBob for god's sake! So you need to be clever and careful when you make a movie about it. This movie has a very very weak lame plot. The GIS work is fine but the story is shallow. I didn't like Ryan's voice on Pikachu. It was like Morgan Freeman doing Mean Girls! Ryan is fun, fine, but we need more than that. We need a voice that brings the character alive; a cute character alive! This Pikachu with this voice was a national geographic production. I also didn't see that English language fit as well. Maybe if it didn't speak or only made voices like (pika pika) would be much better and more appealing. Also the lead, the African American dude, was a horrible choice and a very bad actor.",Pokémon Detective Pikachu
254,pokedom,Hey You Pikachu 2,3,13 June 2019,"I love Pokemon. Grown up with it, still play it today, seen some of the anime movies. It's a great franchise. However this was not a great movie. I put aside all my biases towards the series and went into this movie with an open mind, and I just didn't enjoy it like I wanted to.It wasn't the worst thing in the universe however, as I did find things to like about the movie. We'll list them off first.+ All of the CG was incredibly good looking. I heard about how they hired the guy who drew concepts for ""realistic"" Pokemon and you can tell he had a heavy influence on the designs for the creatures. But it never looked composited onto a green screen or in the middle of the scene in any jarring way. It looked extremely natural.+ Ryan Reynolds does his best with the lines he's given. My absolute favorite part of the movie is when he's crying while singing the iconic theme song to the Pokemon anime. It was so great. And he really sells his role as a Pikachu. Insert Deadpool here. However when he's actually on screen in his human form he's less than desirable.Those are the two main points to enjoying the film. Do you like great effects and Ryan Reynolds? You will like this movie unless all this other stuff that bothered me as well weighs down on you.The story was so predictable I guessed everything that was going to happen before the movie started. I managed to avoid spoilers but it honestly didn't even matter. I knew that Pikachu was actually his dad. I knew that jerk from Edgar Wright's Cornetto trilogy was the old British bad guy. I knew Mewtwo was a red herring. I knew Ditto was that lady in the pink. It was so obvious but the movie honestly acts like it's smarter than the audience. ""Haha the guy who looks like a bad guy and talks about the next evolution of the species is actually the bad guy the whole time! We pulled a sneaky on you haha!""The acting outside of Ryan and maybe the old British bad guy was really bad. Our lead has absolutely no charisma. His reporter sidekick was so bad. The son of the old British bad guy was lame. The head of the police department got typecast into this movie and he doesn't fit the role whatsoever, and his acting is just so bad too.I have to blame the script here for both of those problems. To put it nicely, who wrote this garbage? The dialogue is so bad, I can't even blame the actors, they have nothing to work with! The plot is dumb, the characters are written one dimensional as all hell, nothing about this works. It needed another rewrite to stay afloat.Outside of the great CG, this film is a technical flop. The cinematography was not very good, with no special style or effort put into it. At multiple points the shots changed focus long before it was needed. Like we'll be looking at some Pokemon, then the shot will blur for a second or two, then it'll pan to our lead who is in focus. There was nothing special about its editing either. At times like in the underground fighting ring the editing was really poor. I want to see Blastoise vs Gengar dammit! Stop cutting away! Critical hit! Additional damageeeeee!I didn't like the soundtrack. It was trying too hard to sound like the original game's soundtrack with its digital sounds, and ended up sounding tacky.You can tell Ryan Reynolds wasn't paid very much to be in the movie, to the point where it's comical. He was on set for maybe a day, and when they didn't have him for flashback scenes they used a body double that looks nothing like him. I know this because it's the same guy Ditto transforms into when we see it the first time. The exact same build, black beanie and all, and it doesn't match Ryan's likeness.Overall this film wasn't the best thing ever, and given the opportunity I'd rather rewatch an older Pokemon movie. Something like Pokemon 4ever. That one isn't the best, but it's better than this. If you like seeing your favorite creatures come to life in a great way, or if you like Ryan Reynolds in everything he's in, you can get a kick out of this one. I just look for more than those two things in movies.",Pokémon Detective Pikachu
255,Millennialprince,Detective Pikachu,7,24 October 2019,"Let me preface this by saying I'm not a Pokeman fan, and I don't know anything about the lore or the mythology so I'm strictly judging this as a movie. As a movie, Detective Pikachu was a pretty fun watch. In fact, the world building and the sleuthing felt like Who Framed Roger Rabbit. The CGI was well integrated into the scenes and it never felt out of place. Ryan Reynolds was fine as Pikachu or should I say Ryan Reynolds? But he has a unique personality so you can't fault an actor for playing to his strengths. The only criticism I will level against the film is the villain was easily telegraphed from the get go. I figured out who he was about 30 minutes into the movie, not because I'm super smart or anything but because of the actor who was playing the antagonist. Outside of that, I thought the movie was a fun diversion.",Pokémon Detective Pikachu

But overall, this movie is done well to represent Rime City and Pokemon story with unpredict twist story.",Pokémon Detective Pikachu
257,jdgan,"Ladies and gentleman, a FILM has been made",9,1 June 2020,"Video-game adaptations have been kind of a rough patch but as of recent, we are getting better and better adaptations of games. Assassin's Creed (I love it, don't kill me) and the recent Sonic the Hedgehog film have proved that it can work.This film however, was the beginning of the turning point.PROS:
Most of the VFX are amazing. The Pokemon look realistic without being uncanny (save for Mewtoo and a couple of others), and the rendering and animation of Pikachu itself are both Oscar-Worthy.The story is pretty good, especially during the first 2 acts. Part of the reason why this works is that the film is set up LIKE A FILM rather than an adaptation. People can criticize the formulaic plot but there's a reason why it works so well every time.The world is also amazing and the film does a good job of immersing us into a world where humans live alongside Pokemon. I'm honestly glad that this wasn't a fish out of water story, which is what other game adaptations go for, and the fact that this film didn't gives it an advantage over the Sonic movie.Sound Editing is also incredible in giving the Pokemon unique sounds to diversify them.The directing is also really enjoyable and good.The score was a joy to listen to at times. There were some times when it sounded generic but apart from those times, it felt unique.CONS:
The Cinematography is great at times and we get some VERY well lit shots. But at other times, the color grading feels too washed out and grey (especially during the laboratory sequence), which makes certain scenes look pretty bland. It also even makes some of the CGI look uncanny; the scene with Psyduck and Pikachu in the car is one of those moments as the dull color grading makes the fur on both of the Pokemon look a bit too smooth and thus reaching into the uncanny valley.There are some scenes that have a bit too many cuts. It's not a big issue but it would have benefited from less cuts.The CGI during the giant Torterra garden sequence takes a massive nosedive in quality due to some elements looking too fake and sticking out like a sore thumb. And as mentioned before, the color scheme doesn't help either.The Sound Mixing, while atmospheric at times, wasn't that good during the action scenes. Attacks that should have sounded punchy didn't and despite good visuals, the sound mixing didn't really sell the power and weight behind both Mewtoo's or Pikachu's attacks.Overall, this is an enjoyable film that manages to adapt a recently released and not well-known spin off into a successful film. Ladies and Gentleman, this is how you adapt a Video Game.",Pokémon Detective Pikachu

So when you get Detective Pikachu (perfectly voiced by Ryan Reynolds), commenting on the smallness of someone's office with the line - ""It's not an office, just a coffin with pencils"", then what's not to like. The fact that you also get a reasonable mystery story, and some exciting action set pieces, that do not go into CGI overload, makes the whole thing much more enjoyable to a non-Pokemon person than you had an right to expect.",Pokémon Detective Pikachu

263,deandsouza15892,How much nostalgia is too much nostalgia,9,12 May 2019,"Can movies stop tugging at my childhood heartstrings, cause I'm going to start expecting this level of quality with anything I watch.
Pokemon: Detective Pikachu had only one thing to prove - can they sell you on this world of Pokémon? And if you ask me, they gave us one heck of a result.This movie is very entertaining. As someone who has watched the shows,collected the cards,played the games and embraced the lore,I had a blast with this story. You never fail to believe what they show you - a world where Pokémon and humans live in harmony.I applaud the filmmakers for putting in so much care when it came to worldbuilding.If you think Endgame had loads of Easter eggs, this film captures 7 generations of Pokémon over games,anime and cards , in every single shot. One of my complaints,is that everyone around me in the theatre was whispering and talking, pointing out things they see.Each Pokémon had a reason to be in a scene, and the ones you see them in are instantly memorable. Other than Pikachu and Psyduck, I don't think I saw any Pokémon more than once. They truly utilize the magnanimous landscapes and choose their moments well.Ryan Reynolds steals the show,m; if you like the comedy, you'll never be bored. But there are quite a few moments when you need to just go with it and not over think it. This really isn't a movie,it's more of an extended episode of the anime- weird stuff happens ,physics doesn't work and things are too easy. But as long as you enjoy the Pokémon on screen, you'd give it a pass.As a fan, this is a 9/10. From a movie perspective, more of 7/10.
I'd say, go for Ryan Reynolds, and stay for Pokémon",Pokémon Detective Pikachu
264,dtrani,Pretty...but quite boring,5,26 August 2019,"When first hearing about this film, I was immediately looking forward to seeing it in theaters...Thank goodness I rented it instead for a dollar.
Although very pretty sometimes, not all visuals fitted together and some parts looked undeveloped.
The narrative was probably the most problematic. The dialogue and actual story felt very scattered and all over the place. The film was written by multiple authors (all of them probably having their own vision for the film) which is probably why it doesn't feel super solid. At some moments I would lose myself in the film forgetting about the main plot and sometimes getting confused.
Show this to a small child and he/she will most likely enjoy it. But for someone like me who is looking for a film that can both draw adults and kids, with an excellent story, I feel it falls flat.

Easter eggs exciting and very cute for fans, the performance of Justice Smith is great, and Ryan Reynolds as ¨Pikachu¨ was the best decision they took, I loved it. Visually beautiful, very funny, with an excellent 3D and that is worth seeing the film in that format. The FINAL battle a visual and excellent spectacle. And the end leaves a very nice message.

267,sheldonnylander,Fair but inconsistent,6,24 August 2019,"Having never played the ""Detective Pikachu"" game, I can't attest as to the film's faithfulness to the source material. As a movie on its own merits and with a passing knowledge of Pokemon, I found that I enjoyed this more than I thought I would going in. It has a decent narrative structure (although the villain reveal is a little out-of-left-field; they probably could have used a little more buildup) and likable if somewhat cookie -cutter characters. But, WOW, is the tone inconsistent! Most of the movie gets surprisingly serious and dark early on, and for parts of the film Ryan Reynolds feels more like comic relief. Expect emotional whiplash from this one. Still, it's a fair movie that at least fans of Pokemon will likely enjoy.",Pokémon Detective Pikachu
268,patboldt,The First Decent Video Game Adaptation,6,21 May 2019,"Video games do not equal good movies. At least, that is how it was for decades before this movie came out. People just didn't care about making a good story and trying to honor the game that the movie was based on. Now I'm not going to claim that this is a ""great"" movie. That isn't true. However, I will say that it's passable. This is a passable kids movie.I didn't have any huge expectations going into this. I expected it to be a toned down Ryan Reynolds comedy. That said, I was actually able to have a good time watching this. Ryan Reynolds as Pikachu was definitely one of the best aspects of the movie. Whenever he was on screen I was far more invested because his charisma shines through. The human actors such as Justice Smith, however, are taking themselves a bit too seriously and don't come off as that fun or memorable. Whenever he worked off Ryan Reynolds it was fine but when this wasn't the case it got kinda boring.One of the best compliments I can give this film is that it's fun to look at. The vibrant colors and neon color scheme allows this film to glow and feel much more lively than it might have otherwise looked. Had they given this film a darker color scheme it would have been really dull and unpleasant. This is good because the Pokemon themselves look pretty cool. Half of them look like pretty good and while the other half doesn't look bad it does look far more cartoonish. At the very least, people can get good eye candy when they see the visual effects. The CGI isn't great but it's not god-awful either.Now, this film only gets 6/10 maybe a 6.5/10 if I'm being nice because of some problems that some people may or may not have issues with. The fan service in this movie may be a bit jarring at times but it's also handled a lot better than one would expect. My favorite part was when they referred to Psyduck being prone to headaches. I like fan service when it is like this and not something super jarring. Overall, most of the fan service feels like a love letter to Pokemon fans which is greatly appreciated. The other bad thing about this movie is that the script and dialogue are terrible. This is something that most people won't care about but for someone who likes polished writing and a good script this really stood out to me. A lot of the times the dialogue just didn't make me laugh when it was clearly intended to.If you want to have a good time and watch a movie that feels like a loving tribute to Pokemon this will probably entertain you. If you're looking for a great movie I can't endorse it as such but I can say that it is a movie that can be watched at any time. If somebody were to ask me if I wanted to watch one of the original Pokemon animated movies I really have to think about it. I have to be in the right mood to watch those movies. But that isn't the case here. This is a fun movie that can be enjoyed by most people. It's decent.",Pokémon Detective Pikachu

273,chasemykleby,What almost saves it all is Reynolds's characteristically above-it-all cadence - that playfully sneering quality,5,16 May 2019,"""Pokémon Detective Pikachu"" Review
5/10There are certain aspects of Pokémon Detective Pikachu that don't require a crash course in pocket monsterdom, naturally. You don't need to know the difference between a squirtle and a sandslash to follow, because the movie takes the time to explain every single Pokémon that comes onto the screen!
Detective Pikachu works as a fun pass time only because it is such a weird film for its mainstream sensibilities, but does not completely break the mould of blockbuster movie narrative. It is not bizarre enough to be a classic. It's a hodgepodge of elements we've seen in countless other places - take the rough outline of the Detective Pikachu video game, add a few elements from various Spider-Man flicks, and give it a couple of whirls - but the movie is more interested in mood and banter than it is in anything resembling a compelling narrative shape.
What almost saves it all is Reynolds's characteristically above-it-all cadence - that playfully sneering quality to his diction that makes him ideal for playing inept con men, entitled frat boys, and self-satirizing comic-book mercenaries. It's not so much that there's any particular art to his delivery, but his voice does sound funny coming out of a cuddly little magic creature beloved by young children. The visual milieu has been designed to play up a similar contrast: The nocturnal world of Detective Pikachu feels more like something out of Blade Runner. The Pokémon look like rubber except for the main Pokémon Pikachu, it seems as though all the budget went to making Pikachu look realistic, and all the other Pokémon just seem to be there.
People say that this is the best video game movie, and I can somewhat agree. For me I never considered Pokémon a video game, I consider it a tv show, because that's what I grew up with. I was one that never got into Pokémon and I just liked Picachu growing up. So for this movie to focus on Picachu was a check for me, but it just falls short of being a solid narrative story.",Pokémon Detective Pikachu

Still, the characters are cute and I like the idea of the competitive fights. From the trailer, the movie looked funny and cute, so I wanted to see it.
And that's basically what you get from the film. Ryan Reynolds is funny and charming as the title character. The Pokemon are cute and the CGI is well done. Yet, underneath the surface, the plot is nearly nonexistent and the acting is subpar at best.
So, is it worth watching? Yes. It's cute and funny. You'll laugh and be visually entertained. But once it's over, you realize you really gained nothing from the time spent watching.",Pokémon Detective Pikachu

Cinematography, (Most) of the Designs and Sets are stunning. Some of the pokemon are DEEP in the uncanny valley: especially some of the fleshy ones (Ditto and Psyduck will haunt my dreams). Pikachu and the Main antagonist pokemon are well designed and interesting.However, all of the human characters are either stupid or forgettable. Tim is not as bad but equally forgettable and cliche as his game counter part. The likeable character is Tim's father who we don't see until the end in full. The plot is too reliant on references for newbies to grasp but not deep enough in lore to truly interest to fans. Who is this meant to appeal to?Score:

The film does have a few goofs and a bit of bad acting now and again but it is a kids film so it is acceptable.

Making an adaptation of a gaming world in which is vastly loved is a hard thing to do however I feel that this film done it perfectly and is one of the best adaptations of a game made into live action I have ever seen. I also found that the humour within this film was spot on and helped to really make this film great for the whole family as well as a hit with adults who grew up with the Pokemon franchise. Not only this but having links to Kanto with Mewtwo shown as the villain though later found out to be the good guy within this gave a lot of nostalgia as well as made the audience feel for him and the pain in which he had been suffering. This movie did make me really happy and smile and get excited as well as upset me at moments and have me close to tears with showing how Pikachu was really his father who was about to die. This was a really sweet moment of the movie and one that stayed with me even after the movie ended. I really hope that this is something in which they do more often and that Pokemon keep doing live action movies as this was done perfectly and as a result has become my favourite movie of 2019 so far!There is nothing about this film in which I could fault and I highly recommend Detective Pikachu to those who are a fan of the Pokemon franchise but also those who are looking for a great family movie. This is definitely my favourite movie of 2019 so far and I really hope that they make more live action movies! I am definitely going to be buying this movie when it gets released onto physical format.,Pokémon Detective Pikachu

It had some OK comedy at the beginning and a little throughout, but mostly bad.This was a total disgrace to the franchise. I haven't watched Pokemon recently but was a fan in the past and this does no justice for it. It felt so fake, forced, they changed the whole worlds rules, capturing mew-two was overly simple, easy and stupid, etc. Of course they had to add the cliche ""twist"" to the ending to make it feel like SOMETHING actually happened yet it ruined the movie even more.

But that doesn't take away was it is, Ryan Renolds is the star of the show, and Justice Smith is a mighty fine actor.I thought I was so smart knowing where the plot was going, I definitely did not.
Go see it for yourself, and have a good time!

288,sophaljonesy,A successful translation from cartoon to live action,8,15 May 2019,"Pokémon manages to capture all the elements that made the cartoon series great: adorable Pokémons, spectacle, and action. Besides that, they include typical movie tropes: two unlikely allies teaming up, a powerful villain, and character motivation. This combination makes for a great piece of entertainment. Ryan Reynolds, who voices the titular character, brings the character to life with adorable and quirky qualities. Justice Smith, who plays as Reynold's foil, provides the emotional grounding to the story, and helps elevate the story a lot. Another great point is how the makers successfully translate the Pokémon into live action without making them look creepy. The visual effects are excellent, and the world of Pokémon blends seamlessly in the movie. There are also some great Pokémon on Pokémon action too. However, the movie may not win any Oscars but it serves as great family entertainment.",Pokémon Detective Pikachu
289,ShanTeaTime,"Fun to look at, but not enough Pokemon filled substance",4,15 July 2019,"""Pokemon Detective Pikachu"" is based around the massively popular Pokemon franchise created by Satoshi Tajiri. When Detective Harry Goodman unexpectedly goes missing, it prompts his son Tim to figure out what exactly happened to him. Aiding in the investigation is Harry's former Pokémon partner, Detective Pikachu.This movie is pure nostalgia fodder, I knew that going in. I was/am a huge Pokemon fan, I had to get every new addition of the games that came out. Blue, yellow, silver, emerald, etc. They were all addicting to play and I loved the English dubbed version of the anime as well. So I knew I'd at least get enjoyment out of seeing the Pokemon in actual environments and not have to play a stupid app game to do so, and I was right! The Pokemon themselves are meant to appear more ""realistic"". They look as good in this as they can in live-action settings. Though seeing them portrayed in cave paintings like there's this vast history behind them in school textbooks was too much!I asked myself why they didn't stick to the original first-gen roster though and it still would've been plenty of creatures to work with. Or the first and the second if really needed, but I am biased. One of the best things this movie has going for it besides the Pokemon themselves is the city sets, with all the lighting and neon signs. It feels alive and very much like the embodiment of the games! That being said, I also had major issues with this movie as a whole which I'll get into. Thank god this was under 2 hours long!I didn't know anything about the plot going in, but half of it is random detective plot and the other is literally just the ""Pokemon: The First Movie"" plotline snuck in there with Mewtwo. This is surrounded by very hit or miss humor that sometimes pokes fun at itself. As I was watching it eventually dawned on me that, of course, they had to throw in a completely pointless romance with our main character Tim that was stupid. This is a Pokemon movie, noone cares! Tim as a character himself isn't interesting at all either, he's really just a moron that opens a suspicious looking test-tube with a suspicious looking purple smoke inside. I don't think he's going to have a great career as a detective, but hey Ash did stupid stuff in the series too. We also of course get a cliche ""mom is dead or dying"" arch which is supposed to help us sympathize with Tim. Which it really doesn't...like at all.Ryan Reynolds voices Pikachu in this and it's pretty iconic. Like a miniature, more adorable, less graphic Deadpool. ""I'm gonna get a knife!"" That actually made me laugh! Also Pikachu looks really good in this, the fur they animated on him looks so lifelike. But this brings up 2 points that bothered me within this film. The first one being, did Tim not hear Pikachu talking while first re-entering the living room in Harry's apartment? Because he was mumbling pretty damn loud. Or when he literally said ""oh geez"" ? What a delayed reaction! The second point is, can't Ash understand/talk to his Pikachu in the anime? Or am I mistaken? If so, this kid can't be that special.Going back to Tim real quick. It might sound weird, but this actor works off of characters that aren't really there (ie. Pokemon) better than other human actors in the movie. Did anyone else sense that? When I saw the ""R"" on the test-tube I immediately (like many probably did) thought that it was Team Rocket for sure! That would've been so much better then the Professor X wannabe we get as a villain. I could call that from a mile away, and the fact that yeah we are shown the car crash as proof that Harry ""died"". But it literally proves nothing. You can't visibly see him in the car or get into the car prior. So obviously he's alive. There ain't no mystery there my friends! Also, of course Pikachu isn't going to die! Come on movie! From a rock no less! Or at least that's what I thought happened.One major problem that I had with this movie that many other reviewers probably won't was Mewtwo's voice. It bothered me so much dude! It's so distorted and stereotypically ""alien sounding""! Maybe it's because Jay Goede AKA. Philip Bartlett's voice is so distinctive to me in the animated movie that this plot is clearly ripped out of. It just made no sense to not get the voice actor back again, it would be a great homage! Even though they lost Mewtwo's entire backstory in this, which I can't forgive. Way to strip away a moderately complex and deep plot point of a man-made creatures search for higher purpose and replace it with mush.I was slightly disturbed by ditto's eyes on human actors bodies, I don't quite remember if he could transform into non-Pokemon in the series but it's freaky! Finally, we get to the ending. As I chanted at the screen for our main character to just roll Howard Clifford off the conveniently high building structure they were in, then being disappointed when that didn't happen we find out what happened to Tim's dad. Well surprise! He's not dead, obviously. Dad is actually in Detective Pikachu's body all along, alright I'll bite it kind of makes sense. But his dad was actually also Ryan Reynolds all along...which I have questions about that.I also came to the realization that Pikachu now loses all of his personality traits by the end of the film and the kid wastes a perfectly good (probably expensive) train ticket by throwing it in the trash. The moral of the story, watch the first animated film instead unless you're a die-hard Pokemon fanatic that can overlook all that I just wrote.",Pokémon Detective Pikachu
290,bradinhanson,Pay attention to the name of the reviewer and the hype in their title... it's a newly created bot to offset the negative feedback,4,10 May 2019,The title says it all. I came to watch it for nostalgia purposes. Huge huge fan of the Pokémon franchise but boy was I sorely disappointed in the main character. He gave a B or a C performance. There were too many times I was kicked out of the movie mentally. The interaction Tim has with the girl and pikachu were a bit on the cringeworthy side. On a positive note the story line was good with a nice twist at the end and the Pokémon looked actually pretty cool. Mewtwo was a bit on the fluffy and cute side so prepare to be disappointed if you came to watch this for the nostalgia purposes.,Pokémon Detective Pikachu
291,michaeltong-29180,The mystery is how this movie got made.,2,8 August 2019,"There is a lot wrong with this movie, but the most glaring problem is the lack of chemistry between Ryan Reynolds and Justice Smith. I could have overlooked at lot if they were dynamic and funny together, but they weren't.Most of the time it seems as if Justice Smith isn't even reacting to anything Ryan Reynolds says, as if all the ad-lib stuff was done after. Reynold's Pikachu does make a few funny quips, but other than that the comedy is really flat. It often feels like they aren't even interacting, Justice Smith might as well be talking to air.The visual effects are wildly inconsistent. They tried to preserve the original designs of the Pokemon, and intentionally made them look more animated, which is fine. But it clashes with the photo-realism, especially in exterior nature scenes. Rodger Rabbit felt better integrated in the environment in Who Framed than any of the Pokemon in Detective Pikachu.At times, the blue screen effects are some of the worst I've seen in a big budget film, and the backgrounds are eyesores. The visual design lacks unity; it can't decide if it wants to be realistic.The plot was ridiculous, and there was little to no point in making it a detective story since the characters rarely ever deduce anything, they're just told stuff. It's very formulaic and it doesn't cleverly use the genre to enhance to story.To those who would argue it's for kids, there are way better movies for children than this. I doubt this will ever become a classic, and it will be remembered as another failed experiment in videogame/movie crossovers.",Pokémon Detective Pikachu
292,ljsmith-25626,Huge Potential for Live Action Pokemon,6,16 June 2021,"Going forward I think live action Pokemon movies have massive potential, they just didn't get it quite right with Detective Pikachu. The story is weak and to be honest probably too convoluted for target audiences to understand.

296,aurimasvisockis,"Not good, but not bad either",6,17 June 2019,"It wasn't really bad, but it wasn't really good either. Somewhere between a five and a six. If you are a Pokemon fan, then possibly this is a must see movie, but overall, its one of those ten science fiction movies, which come out within a year. The plot is straight forward, a couple of jokes, Ryan Reynolds being Ryan Reynolds, the main Pokemon look cute, while I have my doubts as to Mew-Two (too much CGI, stands out from the rest of them, looks really video-game like), the end was also much to be desired. But, if you are a fan of Pokemon franchise, I'd say go for it.",Pokémon Detective Pikachu

298,ryan-44110,CGI and world were great... story? Not so much.,4,6 June 2019,"For starters, I watched Pokemon's original cartoon when it first aired back in the late 90's. The art style and the premise/story behind the cartoon was entertaining as an adolescent, but I quickly grew out of it. I know many others have followed along with the many evolutions of the games, story, creatures etc, but I haven't. That said, if you are like me, and have basic knowledge or less of the series/games you will likely be lost through most of the movie. They don't touch on any sort of origin story of what pokemon are, where they came from, why they have powers or why they may or may not cooperate and get along with humans... and what the purpose is of capturing them is, other than battling or to use as a fashion accessory. The movie is pretty, and it shows off several of the old familiar pokemon I recall, plus many new ones I've never seen before. There's no gym battles or anything, as this is more of a peaceful coexistence with pokemon, but the story has a few plot holes between the main character and his 'relationship' with Detective Pikachu and how they're able to communicate. It's a fun ride, but the story falls flat and leaves you asking yourself ""That's it?"" at the end. No cliffhangers or room for sequels from the looks, so this is a one time deal unless something radical changes. It was a better effort than what I recall the cartoon movies producing, but it gets boring seeing the same antagonist(s) at the climax of it all. With as little interaction with the pokemon universe as I've had, I can safely say that.",Pokémon Detective Pikachu

The movie is really fun to watch, Ryan Reynolds never fails the audience in making them laugh with his jokes and acting skills. The visual effects were on point, Legendary Pictures never fails to make you feel that it's a real movie and that the Pokemons are just CGIs.
Story is really based on your knowledge of the actual Pokemon series, if you never followed up, then you wouldn't get the real story of the movie. However, despite that, you will enjoy watching the movie",Pokémon Detective Pikachu

301,TreasureHunterGirl,Good but not great,6,25 February 2020,"I had always hoped for a live action Pokemon movie when I was a kid and now I've got one I'm not sure how I feel.I loved seeing all the ""real"" pokemon, especially the bird pokemon which looked so good soaring around in the sky. I understand that they would always look strange given that their source is a video game/anime. I think they looked great considering this. I loved the look of bulbasaur, pikachu, psyduck, magikarp, greninja and even mewtwo.The landscapes in the opening scenes and even the city were good too. I liked them. They seemed very pokemon-y.The characters and plot, on the other hand, weren't great. I felt like a guy with attitude about pokemon because his dad was obsessed with them was very undermining to the pokemon franchise which often promotes sharing a love of pokemon with people you love. It's what brings everyone together. It doesn't tear them apart. It was strange to watch a pokemon movie about someone who really didn't like them. I would've preferred to have seen the plot go down the well worn road of a rookie beginning their adventure. A full grown man still sulking about playing second fiddle to pokemon was somewhat ridiculous, in my opinion.Due to this unusual choice of age for the protagonist, it made some parts of the movie a little awkward. I'm not sure who the target audience was supposed to be.The acting was fairly average too which I'm guessing is a reflection on the script and the director more than anything. I've definitely seen much better work from Justice Smith, Ryan Reynolds and Bill Nighy.One of my favourite things about Pikachu is how cute it is when it says ""Pika"" and because he spoke English we never really got to hear that.I certainly didn't hate this movie. It was okay. I just really wish it had been all I'd ever dreamed of.",Pokémon Detective Pikachu

305,redcanofevil,Gotta catch em all?,8,12 June 2019,"I am usually very lenient on live action video game adaptations and pretty much always think they were good honest fun. I never believed in the ""There is no good live action video game adaptation"" as I have loved the likes of Silent Hill, Warcraft and all the Tomb Raider movies. Now even if you happen to believe in the saying I'm sure Detective Pikachu breaks the chain for you.
This movie is clearly made by people that love and respect the Pokémon world. I haven't played the Detective Pikachu game so can't say if it's a shot for shot translation to modern cinema but I can get some idea that it tried its best from the little knowledge I have of it. And as a fan of Pokémon that's all you probably want from a Pokémon game. It's like Ready Player One but with only Pokémon references.There are very little negatives I have worth pointing so let's get those out of the way. The main protagonist isn't exactly likeable and in ways makes me wonder if Ash was the smart one. I mean a kid living in a Pokémon world ends up working in an Insurance company instead of being a trainer?! What kind of brain-dead half-wit would even think of working behind a desk when you could be a Pokémon master?!I also would've liked to hear the original voices for the Pokémon instead of the cute and cuddly noise they make if they even decide to that. And the Loudred design was absolutely dreadful, which is a shame considering how rest of the Pokémon looked. The plot is generic and so are the general characters in the movie which ends with a clichéd table turn plot twist which I won't spoil. The acting was passable and the movie felt a bit too grim, gloomy and Hollywoody for a Pokémon movie.
Well those were my only gripes and if you take a read back you'd see those were too lightly treaded and that is because the flaws were relatively mundane and obscure. If you have grown up watching Pokémon on TV or playing the games on your Nintendo you're most likely to love everything else this movie offers. The movie features loads of Pokémon most of which are easy to spot and some you need your eagle vision to spot. There are tons of references to not only the Pokémon canon but pop culture in general.The Pokémons that did show up were immaculately crafted and looked great for a live action design. That cuddly teddy-bear mold that you might've spotted while watching the trailer is gone and in the actual movie it feels more realistic in comparison. They didn't mess with the Pokémon moves (also weakness & resistances) and although they were used fairly less than what I anticipated they were a worthwhile when shown. Few moves felt slightly overpowered but hey maybe that's how strong they are supposed to be. They even managed to include glimpses of the Pokémon tournament and the Snorlax and Cubone references from the game.Also remember how I complained about the seemingly dull and dumb attitude of the main protagonist? They gave a rather believable albeit clichéd reason for it. I am still not sure on a few small events but by the end of the movie you'll likely get most of your answers.And did I mention the amazing score? The iconic Pokémon theme song is there with little variations and there is a part where it's clearly heard being sung by a character which again I won't spoil. There were a few battle themes mixed in here and there and it's hard to complain on any of the score.I won't go into the usual cinematography stuffs as I never expected masterful camera work from a Pokémon movie but it's fairly adequate. The visuals were absolutely on point and CGI never felt cheap or clunky. The script wasn't up to the mark but it does utilize the characters it got with that minimalistic script. It had some good fight sequences but those were few and leave you wanting more. And most importantly it had a heart and tried its best to make the characters and their situation feel relatable, how much it worked varies from person to person. Ryan Reynolds stole every scene he was in and is the main source for the jokes. His take on Pikachu and the stuffs he says throughout the movie is surely going to make you remember he's also Deadpool and make you chuckle for no particular reason.
Overall Detective Pikachu was a great introduction to the live action Pokémon universe filled with tons of Pokémon and even more Easter eggs to spot. A compelling ride with some mesmerizing themes to keep you entertained for the entirety of its run time. I can only hope to see this universe get expanded and maybe see a traditional Pokémon movie where the main focus is catching and battling to be a Pokémon master.",Pokémon Detective Pikachu

And oriental japanese manga-style moments, too. Meanwhile, the action is mostly chaotic and dull. The plot has twists, but all the main moments are plain obvious (although secondary things are great again). And all the personalities are boring and their development is non-existent.

Still, I have fond memories of it and wanted to see this brought to life, and it sure as heck did.All the Pokemon were well designed and felt real in the world. Rhime City felt well-lived and the Pokemon relations were convincing. There were so many ""awwww""s from the audience from their cute antics, and there were few children when I watched it. The building designs of the city were just perfect, reminding me of Tokyo and resemble the cartoons. The acting was pretty good and I liked the twist at the end.Why I almost gave it a 7/10 was the wonky pacing with some very slow scenes that felt forced and drawn out, particularly in the ""mountains"" and when Tim sat down at the station talking about his past to Pikachu. I don't mind character development - I had 0 issue with slow scenes from Endgame, Interstellar, etc, but here it's like forcing me to empathize with a brand new character too fast. Couple with this the lack of action and I was left a little disappointed in the Charizard and last battles.

Anyone can appreciate a joke delivered well, and one can always expect that from him. One thing I really appreciated is that even non-Pokémon fans can enjoy this movie just as much, as everything you need to know is explained. Very few big studio movies made within the past few years are able to tell the story in a way that lets all audiences understand and stay interested, like this movie has.

B. You're not someone who has no idea about it in the first place.You have to be
C. Completely in the middle.I'm someone that has never religiously followed the Pokémon franchise. I don't have the in and out knowledge of which Pokémon powers are better or even what half their names are.
What I do have is a little obsession with Pokémon Go. It keeps days interesting when you're out and about and I've picked up a few things about them along the way.Basically,
I'm in the middle group.The film is what I would call 'obvious' of this kind of genre and it really is probably best for kids or young adults.
However.
I really did enjoy it and it had a really nice twist in the end.
It's so easy to fall in love with Pikachu obviously, particularly because he is voiced by the beautiful Ryan Renolds :)
Plus, it's above average CGI and overall story was actually quite interesting!If you like Pokémon in general and you read this, please don't be too put off by my 6* rating.
I couldn't really give it more than that simply because it just doesn't compare to some other brilliant films out there. But it isn't crap either.Overall. Watch it. Enjoy it. But don't expect anything amazing. It's fun. I'm glad I've seen it. Probably wouldn't watch it again though.",Pokémon Detective Pikachu
325,RexAtTheMovies,Predictable but Fun,6,31 August 2019,"The idea and concept of this movie is awesome, and kudos for landing Ryan Reynolds, it would not have been as good without him. With that said, other than enjoying the occasional nostalgia watching part of my childhood on the big screen, the story was about as cliched and predictable as it comes. But, it has enough highlights to keep you interested, and laughing. Be aware parents, there are 2 swear words in the movie despite the PG rating, so if you are trying to keep your kids from hearing these words (even though they are ""mild"" swear words), be warned.",Pokémon Detective Pikachu
326,thale05,Now THIS is What We've Wanted,7,16 May 2019,"Forget Warcraft. Forget Assassin's Creed. Forget Paul WS Anderson. Forget Uwe Boll (I'm serious about that one). A video game adaptation given critical praise and positive audience feedback is as hard to find as a rare Atari cartridge. But it now seems ""Detective Pikachu"" has broken the bad streak with people calling it the very best like no one ever was. And I somewhat agree.Though I still reserve some minor criticism for this movie, I can confidently say ""Detective Pikachu"" is a success. It gives the fans what we've wanted for years and does so much more to please those nostalgic of the games and anime. I will go so far as to say even if you don't know much about Pokémon you may still enjoy this as a comedy in a neo-noir setting.The story is a standard detective story about a young man Tim (played by Justice Smith who is a lot better with Pokémon than he was with dinosaurs in Jurassic World) teaming up with a Pikachu (voiced by Ryan Reynolds) to investigate the disappearance of the former's father in a city where Pokémon and people co-exist together with no capturing or battling allowed. Still, you got to ask yourself the inevitable question of this world: do humans eat Pokémon since there are technically no animals? Too dark?Sure it recycles a couple of tropes from stories like Sherlock Holmes and other mystery movies but trust me when I say the third act goes absolutely nuts in a good way. And yes, it deviates from the source game in case you're familiar with so there are plenty of surprises. However, it took me about a good ten minutes to predict the twists before they were revealed. Though I found these parts derivative and predictable, it impressively pays off with the climax.I remember critic Grace Randolph saying it was like Blade Runner meets Roger Rabbit with Pokémon and she's correct in that assessment. There's also a bit of a strained father-son relationship theme reminiscent of Spielberg's movies. Most of it centers around Tim who feels as if he pushed his dad away and now he feels guilty about it. This story element really helps keep Justice Smith relatable to the audience in a strange, new world. I think that's why previous Pokémon movies failed to hit well with the critics and our parents: apart from not giving any exposition, none of the characters from the anime were grounded or relatable to invest in. That's where Detective Pikachu fixes things.Of course the standout is Ryan Reynolds who does a good job being Ryan Reynolds: cocky, arrogant with a good sense of comedic timing and a bit of a sarcastic wit to him. And yes, it works well with Pikachu which I admit I was skeptical going into. But the good news is Reynolds is entertaining and charming even as an electric mouse and I found a few hints of Deadpool-like meta humor (don't worry it's PG). And the even better part is how Justice Smith and Pikachu play off each other almost like a kid-friendly 80s buddy cop movie.Almost all the humans give a good performance including one with eyes that'll haunt your dreams for weeks. The only person who I felt gave a subpar effort was Kathryn Newton who plays the newsgirl. It's nothing awful I just thought her proclamations were forced. And Bill Nighy, what a committed actor. Enough said.
But you all want to know about the Pokémon right? Well, I can say the visual effects did the creatures we love so much justice with a few missteps with the bird Pokémon and the way too scaly Charizard. Who would have thought it was possible to blend Pokémon in the real world so smoothly? It really did feel natural. I would have gone nuts had I seen this movie at the age of 7.While there are plot points which aren't original, the movie overall is a fun, entertaining watch for both kids, their parents, and nostalgic adults like me who grew up with this cultural phenomenon which we all thought would be just a fad. Turns out we were all wrong. And I'm kind of glad we were.My rating: 7/10",Pokémon Detective Pikachu

I didn't have huge expectations for this film, but I was sure it would be enjoyable and nice. For the first half it respected my expectations, but the problems arise in the second half, where the film has a real involution, becoming confused and forced. Generally this film is simply useless and adds nothing to the Pokemon universe; on the contrary, it ruins the debut of their first live Action. In conclusion, if you are a Pokemon fan, I suggest you see it only for the nostalgia factor, but I believe that, like me, you will be disappointed. Greetings to all, and see you at the next review.",Pokémon Detective Pikachu
329,bournejackal,Better than expected,6,4 January 2020,"For my first review of the new year. Since there's nothing on tv, I decided to watch Pokémon Detective Pikachu . Why? I did like the trailer so, why not. The movie is about a guy who doesn't have his Pokémon yet and finds out his dad is dead. But runs into a Pikachu and he's the only one that hears him speak . I not a fan of Pokémon, but this was a fun movie. Ryan Reynolds with his voice, made it great to watch. The characters are interesting to say the least. The storyline was good. There are parts that are slow , but it does get better. This was a fun movie to watch. If your a fan of Pokémon or not. My rating is 6/10.

332,getchinator189,Good could be better!,7,7 August 2019,"Visually stunning for sure, good story to get away from copying the original idea of ash Ketchum (which would've been a mess to say the least) and fun moments throughout. The down side... Ryan Reynolds is fun but can get annoying for long periods of time in my personal preference but overall decent adaptation! Not going to blow you away with everything but the story was decent enough. Cast was great, good twists for the plot but villain was kind of foreseeable and easy taken down but hey it was decent all around!",Pokémon Detective Pikachu

334,sleepysunshine,Dropped a key note but overall wonderful,8,12 May 2019,"Putting all biases aside because I am a 20-something person, this movie was very entertaining and visually stunning. Anyone familiar with the Pokemon world, even slightly, will have fun identifying the mass amount of Pokemon integrated in every scene.
The story was ""very twisty"" and followed the game almost exactly. The action stayed persistent even in scenes where you don't expect much. Dialogue between Tim and Pikachu were very natural.
My only problem was Tim...this is a new role for him and I know his character is meant to be akward but a lot of the acting was wooden. In scenes where he could very understandably be angry or scared he showed shock...but that's about it. The female reporter was also similar in that she seemed less empathetic than her role required but I did see more dimensions of her personality.",Pokémon Detective Pikachu
335,aayala-02904,Good movie. Not even a Pokémon fan.,8,12 May 2019,Because of that some of the jokes were lost on me. But I enjoyed the movie nonetheless.,Pokémon Detective Pikachu
336,gigitville,Fun and Full of Heart,8,11 May 2019,"This movie didn't have the right to be this good. I didn't have many expectations going into this movie, despite a curiosity to see Ryan Reynolds as Pikachu, but that was about it. I wasn't even that into Pokémon when I was a kid, but I really like this movie.
It's fun, heartfelt, funny, and has likable characters that actually have arcs. Plus the world building is great, the world feels very realistic and thought through. And the little romantic subplot between the main guy and girl doesn't feel forced and wasn't shoehorned into the plot.
There is a few problems but really, they don't take away from the movie that much at all. There's a decent amount of exposition dumps through dialogue, which is understandable. And there's a bit too much revealed in the third act, one right after the other, and it feels a bit rushed.
All in all, the pokémons are adorable and seamlessly fit into the look of the movie, the pacing is great, the movie didn't jam in anything and everything related to Pokémon for the sake of the brand and name. It's just a really nice, fun movie that's certainly worth seeing. 9/10.",Pokémon Detective Pikachu
337,gustavobacelar-64245,I liked it,7,4 April 2020,"I'm not a fan of the Pokémon franchise and I've never played any of the games or seen one of the cartoons or movies. I just knew that Pikachu existed and that he was the face of the game and cartoon franchise. Anyway, the film is quite entertaining and has an interesting story. The film arrested me for its beginning of mystery that reminded me of some episodes of detective series. (I love detective stories :)). The CGI of the Pokémon are great. It is not something that makes us feel strange at the beginning of the film, because it really looks like they are there. I loved the characters presented (Psyduck is my favorite: 3) and found the ending a little predictable. (I don't mean the villain from the movie> <).",Pokémon Detective Pikachu
338,janusswti,Could be better but not worse,8,17 September 2021,"The first thing that i must write is that Pokemon was a video game before it became an animation series... Can you imagine that? One in a fricking million. Well heck! Castlevania was a video game too... So TWO in a million... And now we see a live action movie, that has old pokemons we loved including and starring our favorite pikachu. Ryan once again delivers the role. He became pkiachu. The rest is history. The script could have been a little bit better. The fighting scenes between pokemons a little bit longer... But hey! Overall is a good movie.

340,adriano-40012,So entertaining !,7,11 May 2019,"Before I start whether you like Pokémon or not. This movie is so funny when Pikachu starts to talk. I laughed so much. Pikachu'sanimation looks cute and realistic. I grew up with Pokémon and still love Pokémon games even the new games. I can tell you just watch the trailer every Pokémon in the movie looks so good. They really put a lot of love in detail.The storyline is simple Tim and Pikachu investigate the case of Tim's dad. On their journey they find out evidence and get in trouble. It's so hilarious, but not chaotic and it's not forced. I was afraid that they'd mess up the story but they did very well. I enjoyed the movie from the start to the end. The movie focuses on the relationship between Pikachu and Tim. Through the movie I somehow knew what happens at the end. I won't tell you for sure. To all doubters give it a try you won't get out disappointed. You'll have fun and go out happy. Me and my friends we had such a great time during the movie. I think the challenge for the movie was to build up a clear decent story.The only critic I have is that I had to watch it in 3D I'm not a fan of 3D. There was just a few 3D effects. I'm going to buy it for blu Ray definitely. I will enjoy it even more in 2D.",Pokémon Detective Pikachu

342,rajveerdhanak,A faithful-yet-flawed adaptation,6,18 May 2019,"I'm reviewing this game as a casual viewer, as I'm not a Pokémon fan, although I have played and enjoyed the earlier games and series a few years back. As all most casual viewers, I too ended up in the cinema seats as a result of the brilliant marketing of this movie. And also, Deadpool voices a cute fluffy animal.Keeping in mind that I'm not the target demography for this film -- which is primarily Pokémon fans and children in general - which will factor in how I review this.The best part about this film is that it's very focused on its own world-building and plot. This makes me glad that Warner Bros. has definitely learnt to keep the focus on the story of the film itself instead of desperately try to set up sequels for an extended cinematic universe.The VFX and cinematography are the best parts of this movie and are incredibly stunning. Not just the photorealistic Pokémon, but even their movements, mannerism and skin/fur textures and the way these interact with the environment, is very well done. The visual beauty of the film has partly to do with the fact that this movie was shot on photochemical film, it's also about the incorporation of colours through the environment and lighting, which also helps in a distinct world building.Speaking of which, the world building is well done. It does get exposition-heavy at times, but several things are definitely conveyed through showing things in a subtle manner that give you good idea of how Pokémon and human relationship is like with animals - either you capture them, or you work with him.Ryan Reynolds carries the film, not just voice but facial expressions too - thanks to facial motion capture. He's not just great at conveying the sarcastic, wise-crack nature of the character, but even emotional and flawed nature as well.Speaking of other characters, I couldn't really care about Justice Smith and Kathryn Newton's characters, the latter who is simply another foil character and a romantic setup for the sequels. Part of it as to do with the performance and how they're directed, but primarily is an issue stemming from a rather bland and unrefined screenplay.Ken Watanabe - playing a detective -- is a great actor, having seen him in the Batman films, Inception and Godzilla. But his dialogues were too exposition-heavy and unnatural, which had affected his performance and how much audience can be convinced by it.Coming to the pacing, the film gets bland and boring in several scenes in Act 1, especially where Pikachu and Tim start investigating the latter's father's disappearance. The problem mainly stems from the fact that we never really see why Tim wants to search for his father, considering that we see him as a character who tragically had stopped caring about anything.Though the weakest point in the film is its exposition, where it's another blatant exposition-through-dialogue. The problem is that it's very clear that the characters are giving exposition, which makes it all the more unbelievable and fake.Understanding that the movie is made for kids, but even basic comprehensible things are spoken out to the audience, as though the audience is stupid and inattentive. It often becomes less of ""show, don't tell""The ending is indeed ""a twist, very twisty"" in the words of Pikachu. At face value you understand it, but the more you think about it, it just doesn't make sense and is plain stupid.But I may be looking too deeply into a film made for 12-year-olds. At the end, it's definitely an entertaining film and a fun watch. I'd suggest giving this film a watch without any great expectations from it.",Pokémon Detective Pikachu
343,whiterose-54828,Not Quite a Critical Hit,6,16 November 2021,"I have been a fan of the Pokémon series since I was a child, first getting into the games with Ruby and Sapphire on the Game Boy Advance and being obsessed with it ever since. Someone who is as big a fan as I am should automatically love this movie, right? Well no, not exactly.When it was first announced that they were making a Pokémon movie and that not only would it be live action but would also be based on an obscure spin-off game few have played I was understandably confused yet cautiously optimistic. After finally watching it I think it was ok, it certainly could have turned out a lot worse but that doesn't mean it's without it's flaws.Firstly Pikachu himself, personally I think Ryan Reynolds was miscast in this role. Unlike many casual audiences I understand that this is a version of Pikachu that is supposed to talk though I still don't think Ryan Reynolds' voice fits the character. I'm unable to take Pikachu seriously when he essentially just sounds like and has the personality of Deadpool. I remember when the game released fans were petitioning for Danny DeVito to voice Detective Pikachu, I feel he would have been a better choice and not casting him was a huge missed opportunity.The movie's world also feels very artificial to me, from the CGI Pokémon that never quite feel like they're actually there to Ryme City which is pretty much just London with some added CGI, a fact they don't try to hide at all with London buses, underground signs and even the iconic skyscraper The Gherkin in plain view. It's clear they tried to make the Pokémon somewhat realistic looking while also keeping their cartoonish features, this works fine for some like Pikachu and Psyduck but others like Charizard and Torterra just end up looking a bit strange and uncanny.The story starts fine enough with a mystery involving our protagonist Tim's deceased father and a mysterious gas that turns Pokémon violent but starts to go off the rails into full blown insanity in the final act. There are some strange moments and concepts I'm not sure I like as they don't seem to fit in with the lore of the game's universe, I understand this is a different continuity but as an adaptation I'm not sure it should change things up to quite this degree. There are some nice nods and references to the games and other media that I liked, even if some feel a bit too forced.Overall Detective Pikachu is decent enough for a movie based on a video game. If you can ignore it's issues then it's harmless and fun. It seems unlikely there will be a sequel to this particular story but it would be interesting to see other movies set in this world as we don't get to see much of the more traditional Pokémon Trainer side of things in this one.",Pokémon Detective Pikachu
344,arskhemnanilack,Detective Pikachu - 7.3/10,7,8 May 2019,"Detective Pikachu is a bright, fun and entertaining ride throughout it's 1 hour and 45 minute runtime. Starting with what's good with the movie, it is quite entertaining. The little action in the movie is very exciting and insanely fun to watch. The Pokemons in this movie are definitely it's best part. They're portrayed very well and fun. Many are also used in practical ways, like Squirtle spraying water and being apart of a firemen squad. Although, what really stood out in this movie and is the only reason you should watch it, is Pikachu. Ryan Reynolds absolutely outdid himself with this character, it's so great throughout all of its scenes in the movie, and uplifted scenes with good comedy. CGI is a bit mixed throughout the movie, it can be bad, but mostly good and impressive. A few noticeably bad CGI scenes isn't a big deal, considering how much was really used for this movie. Although, that's just about the most I can think about to say that's good about it. Throughout all of this movie, Tim (the main character) just seemed to have not cared. Right from the moment he found out about his dad's accident, he was either happy throughout or just pretty much didn't care or seem down about it at all. Justice Smith (who plays Tim) is not who I have a problem with, infact, in scenes where he is meant to be happy, he did a great job. It's the writing and script that I have a problem with. Towards the end, he nearly, entirely, forgot about his dad and was just about to end it there. Like I said, the Pokemons definitely stood out and was excellent in this movie, but the human characters were terrible. The story was rather predictable and insanely messy. The end of the movie and the ""big twist"" was made predictable from the first 15 minutes. There's way too much going on at times, and it tends to push the actual important stuff away, many of the things were completely useless. Overall, POKEMON: Detective Pikachu is regardlessly just a fun ride throughout, if you don't mind a bit of mixes and a weak plot. There's still a lot of fun to be had in this movie regardless of age. Unfortunately, just not a lot of substance in the movie, and instead just a good watch for Pikachu alone.",Pokémon Detective Pikachu
345,themoviedoctor,Bringing Pokémon into the future,8,27 June 2019,"I grew up watching Pokémon on Cartoon Network and trading Pokémon cards with my friends on the playground. When this movie was announced, I was ecstatic for the chance to relive part of my childhood on the big screen.This movie was fun, entertaining, and even had a moderately interesting plot. It does not feature Ash and our other Pokémon friends, but instead brings us a new narrative about Pokémon. My favorite part about the film, however, was the CGI depiction of the breeds of Pokémon and the personalities each were given. I was anticipating that it would be difficult to bring these creatures to life when the audience is so used to a cartoon depiction. But it did not disappoint!",Pokémon Detective Pikachu
346,KirkFogg,"As a die hard original Pokémon fan, this was pretty fantastic.",9,20 May 2019,"As was the case for millions of Detective Pikachu's viewers, I grew up with Pokemon. The cards made their way to my small southern town in late 1998 and from then on I would forever be a fan. I collected them all and have played thousands of hours of Pokémon Red/Blue/Yellow over the last two decades. Being somewhat of a purist, I was hesitant to watch this movie. After all, the only other Pokémon movie that I've seen (and in theaters) was Pokémon: The First Movie in 1999. All of this just to say, I absolutely loves this movie. I definitely think that was due in part to having low expectations all across the board. I like Ryan Reynolds and have been a fan for years, but I felt he was kind of shoe-horned in to this roll. With Ryan Reynolds, we all know what we're getting--smarmy and hilarious often beautifully disgusting dialogue with almost wholesome shock value, if such a thing exists. I didn't think that would play well with this character, franchise, or movie in general, but I was proven wrong. I genuinely can't remember the last movie that had me smiling through so much of it. My cheeks genuinely hurt by the end of the movie, but that was a complaint I didn't mind having. Most of the Pokémon that were featured heavily were from the first generation, which was definitely exciting to me and my friends.

I really enjoyed watching the realistic pokemon in the film. The CGI is perfect. Every pokemon looks so real and just simply adorable. And I think Ryan Reynolds did a wonderful job as Pikachu.

It stayed true to the game version, the animation was great, and amazingly not even a hint of ""Wade""!Story was simple, plot was not too deep, acting was just average. But being a kids movie, i didnt mind these at all. I was a little bit bored when the conversation got heavy though. I imagine it would had been better if there were more pokemon battle scenes. But then again, this is a kids movie. If my kids were entertained, thats good enough for me.And if you're not a hard fans of pokemon, need no worry. Its enjoyable for everyone.

357,LinaInverse23,A disappointing endeavor!,5,14 May 2019,"Detective Pikachu certainly built up a ton of hype, as it looked to be the best video game to screen adaptation ever. Enlisting Ryan Reynolds as the voice of Pikachu was a smart move, and brought in many fans to see the film. The film as a whole... disappointing.
The biggest issue with the film is its lack of character development. Certainly no ones goes to a Pokemon movie to see what the humans are up to, everyone is more worried about the little pocket monsters and what they look like on the live-action big screen. The curiosity and wonder about them, however, quickly wears off, leaving only the main characters to continue carrying the film. Justice Smith as Tim Goodman was a great choice, and holds his own throughout the film, although he could have been given more to chew on- the only focus is on his missing/dead father. Ryan Reynolds as Pikachu, is of course wonderful, and every scene with him is entertaining. The largest missing development, and a very criminal one at that, is Kathryn Newton's Lucy Stevens. Her character seems so energetic, so full of life and inquisitive- it is a travesty she was not developed more. There are no real motivations behind her actions aside from her wishing to become a full reporter- who is she, where does she come from, why did she want to become a reporter? In fact, by the end of the movie, I could not recall what her character's name was.
As there is a severe lack of character development, and even chemistry, the script falls flat a bit, and there is no investment in the story. The story in and of itself is not very good and the film ends up becoming too predictable. Aside from these flaws, fans of the Pokemon series will no doubt be entertained through the whole film. A few years from now, however, most will have forgotten about this film and it will not be on the ""must see again"" list.",Pokémon Detective Pikachu

However, upon seeing the wonderful, riveting plot of this masterpiece of a film, that old childlike wonder that I'd once had before I became a cynical fuck began to return, and I was enjoying myself. Pikachu is great, and so are the Pokémon. This film was excellent, a joy to sit through and exceeded all expectations. Without a doubt, the best movie of 2019, and it's not even close.

Most moviegoers are here for the nostalgia, the cuteness, the live action pika pika. But as a movie, it's rather boring and predictable. The first half is good purely because of Ryan Reynolds. He and the main character(forgettable) play a sort of buddy cop movie, vibes similar to the Seth McFarlane Ted movie. The second half is downhill, lacking the funny moments and one liners, so you're stuck with forgettable main character A, forgettable love interest B, forgettable villain C, generic big bad evil corporation D, and overall bland dialogue.
I'll give it a 5/10 for nostalgia and the first half of the movie, but that is remarkably generous.",Pokémon Detective Pikachu

But I saw the trailer and Pikachu was so cute and the story seemed quite original, so I decided to give it a chance. As a movies fan, sometimes I watch films I wish I hadn't.
But Pokémon was actually great. I know I missed a lot because fans around me screamed, laughed and cried when some creatures appeared and I had no idea why they were causing that reaction.
But I enjoyed the movie none the less. CGI is truly breathtaking and characters and story are good and coherent.
It's a very interesting crime solving story and you never see the ending come.

369,jamielee_uob,Pokemon Detective Pikachu...yes yes yes,8,11 May 2019,"A world immersed with real life people and Pokemon living side by side is somewhat of a fantasy for the pokefans among us, so delivering this concept to us through the cinema world was, some said, thought to be a tall order....Think again poke doubters! Pokefans, like me, will have a sense of nostalgia as their minds start racing to the past Pokemon experiences in Kanto....yet somehow the brain goes full steam ahead into the future of what could really be...a world with Pokemon and humans!Forget the storyline for a second, the detailed look and feel of the Pokemon in the new city of Rime, along with the everyday concepts of the real world mixed in are a sight to behold. Whether it's a Machamp directing traffic or a Charmanders tail being used to cook street food, it's all just beautiful to watch. Whilst some Pokemon may look somewhat strange and different to what you would expect (a furry Pikachu and a scaley Charizard), it does sort of work when you begin to understand the concept of this new world! However, as someone who is purely a generation on 1 and 2 fan, I was a little disappointed to see quite a few Pokemon that I didn't even know the names of. Whilst the gen 1 list predominantly feature, many scenes left me wondering... ""who are these things""....but luckily it did not disturb the flow of the movie or hinder my understanding of the storyline.....And so to the plot... with only little expectation (a Pikachu as a detective, really?) I was pleasantly surprised. Emotion, action, dramas and more were all included in this production which is based on a quite poor 3DS game. The storyline manages to incorporate all the elements of a modern Hollywood classic whilst maintaining that fantasy of Pokemon that we all dream about every night. Some scenes are farfetched (excuse the pun poke fans) but name me a film in this day and age which doesn't have those?...I'll wait....Overall, this movie exceeded my expectations. Everyone who watches will leave thinking the same thing... I want my own Pokemon partner. The movie has done its job in that sense!... to the real Pokemon fans, none of the storyline will matter. Just watching a world in which Pokemon exist with humans is enough, and one can only hope that can become a reality...but for now, this will more than do. For those new to the Pokemon world, this film won't seem as good or at all worth it...so you should probably just go back under your rock and try finding a life worth living, a life that we pokeballers are loving....
J-boss review gives 8.1/10",Pokémon Detective Pikachu
370,gandalf_theWise14,"Largely disappointing, ""Pikachu"" is mediocre at best",3,20 August 2019,"Now, I'll start off by saying I was never really big into Pokémon, so this review is from the point of view of someone who watched this purely as a movie. There is no influence of nostalgia, and I had no previous connections to any of these characters going into the film. I don't know if this has a huge impact on my opinion of Pokémon Detective Pikachu, but I found it difficult to see what all of the hype is about.Originally, I thought the basic concept behind this film was interesting. Basically, Pokémon live in the same world as we do, and humans collect them and force them to battle each other. It's essentially a gladiator fight but with Pokémon (and the loser actually survives, at least from what I could see). Anyway, this guy Howard Clifford has created Rhyme City, a place where humans and Pokémon can coexist, and this is where our story takes place. Not a bad idea for the basic setting of a Pokémon film, and it did set up for some fun moments. In fact, this movie is at its best when it is simply bringing these Pokémon to life, creating some very cool scenes.It's when we go beyond the basic concept to the actual story of this movie where things start to go downhill fast. Tim, the protagonist here, seems to be a normal guy (at least, normal for this Pokémon world) except for the fact that he doesn't have a Pokémon companion. I guess it's a ""thing"" for people in Rhyme City to bond with a Pokémon, kind of like a pet, and the human and Pokémon go everywhere and do everything together. However, also like a pet, humans have no mean of understanding their Pokémon, though it seems the Pokémon can understand them. Anyway, Tim gets a call from the police telling him that his dad, a detective, has died in a car crash, along with his Pokémon. Tim gets the keys to his dad's apartment, where he goes to look around at what he may have left behind. Here he finds Pikachu, a Pokémon that he can mysteriously understand, but no one else can. This sets the plot in motion, where we find out that Tim's father may not have died after all. Tim and Pikachu team up to discover who is behind all of this, and where Tim's dad is.Now, maybe that doesn't sound too bad (though I found it to be a pretty weak premise). But the farther along we get through the story, the more ludicrous it gets. I mean, maybe I should have known what I was getting into with a Pokémon movie, but some of the things in this film were just flat-out ridiculous. This was also an incredibly predictable movie. Almost every major ""twist"" I had predicted from the very beginning of the film. It's one of those movies that make the most predictable move every single time; it's almost like they were trying to use as little creativity as possible. The plot here isn't just bad, it's outright horrendous.The ending of this film is also just terrible. A Pokémon is used as a deus ex machina. A hopeless situation is reversed completely in a matter of seconds. We literally hear the line, ""I will undo everything that has been done."" Again, how unimaginative can you get? There was so much creativity when it came to bringing this weird, interesting world to life, and then it all vanished as soon as they had to actually write the script.I was shocked when I learned that this film was only 104 minutes long. I was so incredibly bored at so many points that it felt well over two hours. That is, of course, never a good sign; you never want a movie to feel LONGER than it actually is.This film had a $150 million budget, and it was very apparent watching it. The CGI is stunning; the Pokémon look amazing and Rhyme City is beautiful. The problem with the film is certainly not the visuals; it is, in fact, visually a very impressive movie. However, like so many great-looking films these days, there is no substance in the script to make the visuals be much of anything beyond something pretty to look at.The character of Pikachu was actually quite dynamic and fun to spend time with. Beyond him, however, the rest of the characters are incredibly bland and one-dimensional. The main protagonist himself is unlikeable and does nothing to justify his screen time; he is simply an uninteresting character. The character of Lucy is one of the most annoying on-screen presences I've seen in a while. Again, an unlikeable character that I had no incentive to root for. When you find yourself not caring whether or not the main characters will succeed, there really is no longer a point in watching the movie. In that sense, the makers of this film failed miserably.The one bright spot here is Ryan Reynolds as the titular character, Pikachu. He brings loads of energy and enthusiasm into this role, and even though we can't actually see his face, I could see that he was really into this character. I applaud him for that, especially considering he may have actually saved this from being among the worst films of the year with his performance. Perhaps the one thing keeping me awake was the energy Reynolds brought into each scene. There was a noticeable change in the mood and atmosphere when Pikachu enters the film; it goes from boring and lifeless to vibrant and even a little fun. I don't even want to think about where this film is without Reynolds.As for the rest of the cast, it felt like they were straight out of a Nickelodeon show, other than Ken Watanabe (who I wish had a much bigger role). There are several ""actors"" in here that I don't see having much of a future in the acting business. Justice Smith was just not good. His performance was lifeless and created a character that I found it very hard to like. It was even worse because his performance was very important for the film. He really had to nail his role for the movie to work the way it was intended, but he came up way short of where he needed to be. No one else stepped up either, so the film was put almost entirely on the shoulders of Ryan Reynolds, and despite his talent, he can't carry a movie by himself.Before I end this, I would like to say that this whole Pokémon movie concept was actually really cool, and I might watch a sequel to this if they can apply more imagination to the script, and maybe cast better actors. It just seems a shame to waste this cool, interesting idea on whatever this film was. Maybe they'll figure out how to properly do this some day.Overall, Pokémon Detective Pikachu is a massive disappointment. The film's budget allows for some incredible CGI, and Ryan Reynolds provides a fun, energized screen presence. But an unimaginative plot and bland, unlikeable characters make for a decidedly boring movie.",Pokémon Detective Pikachu

I mean it went smoothly and there weren't any plot holes or anything. But it wasn't that exciting either. The ending was a little predictable, storyline pretty generic, nothing new.

372,jamesba-640-753446,Distinctly average,5,10 May 2019,"Unfortunately, this film was mediocre, squandering any potential it did have. The tone was bizarre, too kid friendly yet too 'adult' for children. It needed to be either Scooby-Doo-esque or more of a mystery. I would not have minded if they committed to it being explicitly for children, but unfortunately this film rides the line and comes off as sloppy.
The universe it is set in could have been awesome, but seemed a bit out of touch. For example, a Machamp directing traffic is a neat concept, however in the ""real world"" it would not work as Pokémon do not understand the concept of congestion. The main lead, Justice Smith, was too weak to carry the plot.
Although there was some neat twists and turns along the way, this was not enough to salvage this film. It was enjoyable at the time, a highlight being the Mr. Mime sequence, but this movie will soon be forgotten about! If you like Pokémon it has just about enough nostalgia to make it worth a watch.",Pokémon Detective Pikachu

It is saturated with political and social justice propaganda. Black hero taking over a white character? Check. White girl falls in love with black hero? Check. Every scientist is a woman and/or a person of colour? Check. They even throw in global warming ""jokes"". I am so tired of these corporate nonsense movies.

375,battlecrusadersgames,Fun at any age,7,27 June 2019,"In this live action spin off of the hugely popular video + card game franchise, Pikachu teems up with a Human to find out why he lost his memory and what happened to the man's Father.
Despite this being a very different kind of Pokemon movie, there's adult jokes and Pikachu talks, there's also still a lot of Pokemon essentials still present...The Pokemon still mix with Humans instead of actual animals, Pikachu is still as cute as a button and there's lots of colour, despite the serious nature of the plot.
While we're on the subject of story, the plot here is good, but i do wonder how many kids actually will completely understand it, because it's very complex for a Pokemon movie, but at least there's plenty to keep both kids and adults alike amused.
As for the animation, it really is flawless, it really looks like the Pokemon are actually right there with the actors.
For negative criticism, i'm not sure i would have cast Ryan Reynolds as Pikcachu, remember this is the man who's voice is so synonymous with Deadpool now and there isn't quite as much magic as the first movie or the TV series, but on the whole, this is still fun, even if only fans of the franchise.",Pokémon Detective Pikachu

I watched this movie as a big Pokémon fan, and I can't say that I didn't enjoy some of it. Don't get me wrong, it's a bad movie, but I really appreciate the extra facts and lore referenced throughout, as well as seeing beloved characters in a kind of horrific but amazing 3D rendering. But besides that, the movie has no real redeeming qualities. So if you aren't a fan, I wouldn't recommend it.

""No way that's gonna work!"" my mind said.
Then I see the trailer,
""Well that's not bad. Somehow Ryan Reynold as Pikachu actually works!"" my opinion grew on the movie.
But I'm still not convinced on the movie. Because like any other movies, the trailer just show the good part of the movie but when you actually watch the full movie you will get disappointed because of build up expectation from the trailer.
And most of the time when movie adapted from game, the end product will be a huge disappointment!

Good acting, overall good voice acting by Ryan and the graphics/storyline are great. It's not perfect, but it's a huge leap in contrast to other video game and cartoon movies brought to a life through modern CGI.They did this movie justice.

390,francesca_shin,Don't know anything about Pokemon so...,6,15 June 2019,"I think most of the time you don't need to know the entire book/comic/gamer history of a film if its been made well. I have not watch any of the anime or played the gameboy so hoped I would get caught up. It felt like we skipped to a place and time where almost every human had one pokemon companion (in another genre also called a familiar?!) and focussed on a new story. The animation looked crisp (and immensly cute), the story kind of has been told before with a police procedual thrown in. Ryan Reynolds always plays a fast talking cheeky chappy which was OK, not sure who else auditioned. Hated that Rita ora had a small part - she looked like she had to really really practice her lines.
Overall, even if you aren't a diehard fan I think you'll still enjoy it",Pokémon Detective Pikachu
391,gaamst,"Good, but could have been great",8,10 June 2019,"Surprisingly good. Clever twist on the overly familiar hunting & gathering formula that most people associate with Pokemon. But at the same time it remains respectful to the material.I grew up with the original Pokemons, so naturally the creatures were the most fascinating part, and I was surprised at how well the CGI worked. Their general look and expressions more than made up for the fact that they do not speak. Which they also pointed out in the movie, that although Pokemons can't communicate with humans, they can understand how humans feel.Which brings me to the only thing I did not like about the movie. I believe it would be better if Pikachu did not have the ability to speak. Plot-wise it kind of made sense in the end, but it was only Harry's conciousness that was fused with Pikachu, so why did he need to talk? Lucy and the other Pokemon-owners could not when they were fused. And why didn't Tim recognize his dads voice?No disrespect to Ryan Reynolds though, as he was great, but with a PG-movie it's hard to be Deadpool-funny. Pikachu actually became more of a Mascot, a PG-Ted. It was Psyduck who stole the show, despite only being able to say his own name. I believe the main human-characters would become stronger also if Pikachu was muted, and the connection between the Pokemons and their owners.Maybe Harry didn't even have to survive or be fused with his Pokemon-partner, perhaps Pikachu should have been the last connection Tim had to his father, and that might have elevated their relationship even further.Still, I liked this movie a lot. They also managed to make it enough of a character-study for the action to matter, which is rare in 2019.",Pokémon Detective Pikachu

402,joao-luiz_mjr,Why would you waste Ryan Reynolds like this?,4,25 June 2021,"The pokemon are all cute and just cartoonish enough to both be recognizable and somewhat realistic without being uncanny, and of course Ryan Reynolds' pikachu is witty and fun to watch, but that's about it for the positives, and they fall short when there is so much bad acting and so many scenes both poorly conceived and structured that I felt downright insulted just by watching them.The humor often relies on making the human main character the butt of a joke or the victim of a slapstick accident in gags which were already getting stale a decade ago, and while we're talking about him, why would you write the human lead as that much of an insufferable idiot? He thinks holograms are real even after being told they're holograms. He drags his feet about everything throughout the first half of the movie like he's no more invested in the story than I am! He's going through life-altering events yet judging by the look on his face he's lost the ability to feel anything other than constipation since he was a child. Maybe that explains why he's as sour and unpleasant as a rotten lemon.If the entire premise of the movie banks on having the extraordinary event of being able to talk to a pokemon, why would you sabotage your story by making one of the leads the worst character in the movie? Why are you doing this to me? What did I do to deserve this hell?",Pokémon Detective Pikachu
403,riles-14932,"Nails the strengths, and problems with Pokemon storytelling.",5,2 January 2020,"While this movie looks fantastic, the story is told in the laziest fashion. You've seen this movie many times before, and fails to do something interesting. This movie is an okay stone to build from in the future when better writers take a swing at this untapped universe. Ultimately this movie is good to watch if you want something in the background. The classic style without substance with cliche characters and dialogue.",Pokémon Detective Pikachu
404,gio_vvanni,like hitting full throttle but accidentally hitting a bit of the brake,8,19 March 2020,"I really enjoyed this movie. It's a good movie, with a solid story. I like how they adapted the pokemon world, the pokemon battles, without forcing and making ""spontaneous"", natural. I really loved how it's showed the normality of a world with pokemon, with few scenes, few significant detail to let us understand how it works.
Also the story, it's a good story, with enjoyable ideas, with interesting plot twist.Detective pikachu is a simple, well written and well done movie. The reason I don't give 10/10 is just some acting. I don't really know Justice Smith and Kathryn Newton as actor, as I haven't seen them on other movie, maybe they're good actors and they've just badly directed. But there is some moment in which they appear really ""unnatural"", out of the movie. I really perceived them as ""fake"" thus I didn't like them here.On the other hand Ryan Reynolds made a good performance on his character, I have to recognize it.After all a really enjoyable movie, a few step from being a perfect movie, for some few details. It's a same. Nontheless I'll watch it again",Pokémon Detective Pikachu
405,Akaanksh,Flawed yet lives up to the legacy of Pokémon,8,16 May 2019,"This silver screen adaptation of the world phenomena successfully takes off by brining a new genre to the world of Pokémon while also breaking the shackles for video-game based movies.
While the games and anime focused on the joy of living in a Pokémon World, this film focuses on the downsides of living in that world, especially in the first act when the protagonist - Tim Goodman finds it hard to befriend a Pokémon unlike many others of his age. His inability to do so is questioned constantly and so is his intricate relationship with his father.
While the first two acts are good, it's the third act that messes up. The story tries to play the element of surprise too hard but fails to do so. The conjunction of the last two acts takes place in a nuclear factory, from where the story starts going downwards as it eats up a lot of screen time that doesn't do anything except giving exposition. The finale was very good and is well done but it was bogged down by the overwhelming amount of plot-twists, which should've been avoided at all costs.
Nevertheless, the final twist is surprisingly good and ends the film on a high note. Coming to the acting part, Ryan Reynolds does an exceptional job as always and the other actors, especially Justice Smith did very well.
The credits start with an 8-Bit battle sequence from the original 'Red and Blue' game and progresses to the film's version, showing the legacy of Pokémon, which has now reached new heights.",Pokémon Detective Pikachu

409,fleurconstance,here we go again,5,17 May 2019,"Everyone heard about Pokemon franchise. Please, don't say ""no"" i know everything about you.
Fame comes to this franchise periodically.
Basically it was Game Boy videogame, one of the symbols of late 80's. Then was anime series which made Pokemon famous to all the world. Two years ago a lot of gamers from bunch of countries catched thousands of monsters in Pokemon GO game on Android and iOS.
And here we go again. I don't know why but first live action movie was released just yesterday.
Pokemon Detective Pikachu is more than weirdo product. Firstly u couldn't understand some episodes of movie without basic knowledge about Pokemon Universe. Second it's more than classical style blockbuster about the big and little monsters.
So, what about screenplay?
Tim is one of those people who doesn't need no pokemon as a friend. I don't know why but he choosed profession of insurance agent instead pokemon trainer. Destiny makes him to went to Ryme city to say goodbye to dead father who was killed by something invisible. But our hero met only Pikachu there. Pikachu who wanna be Sherlock.
And screenplay is really bad. I have feeling that all powers of screenplayers were used to make a lot of fan service instead good story. And that's a good idea if u'll see at box office results. 'cause u'll see at this movie all the most famous pokemons. Charmander, Squirtle, Psyduck, Magicarp and of course Pikachu. Tim can translate ""pika pika"" so it's a nice theme to make gag. Especially if u have Ryan Reynolds as voice of Pikachu. It's funniest part of movie who tries to make you sleep just like Jigliepuff.
Pokemon Detective Pikachu - it's dumb but beautiful attraction. U can watch this if u know anime tv series or have some memories from pretty far childhood. Or maybe u was fan of franchise since beginning with trading card game and Game Boy videogames. U can watch it even if u was pokemon trainer in recently mobile app haha.",Pokémon Detective Pikachu

411,fatousanokho,Reluctant at first...,7,12 September 2021,My 8y and I enjoyed this movie. At first she was like naaah I'm not into Pokémon anymore. As soon as the movie introductory started and the earth turned into a Pokémon ball she was so into it.We loved how the movie and cartoon blended well together. We were able to recognise most of the Pokemons. The story line was great and level of violence was mild enough for a child to watch.It croule have been nice to see Pika using his power.We had a great time watching it.,Pokémon Detective Pikachu
412,Slim4Shady2,Good but nothing Amazing!,6,17 May 2019,"Being a fan of Pokemon, I was surely going to watch this movie no matter how it's going to be received. So, without any expectations I watched this movie and I won't say I'm disappointed. It was fun, brings nostalgia, a nice way to make a story revolving around Pokemon in the outside world but just doesn't give you great feeling at the end. Kudos to the VFX department though, the emotions evoked by Pokemon (or just Pikachu) were just too good, Ryan Reynolds as always delivers with his comical elements. Do watch it if you are a fan of Pokemon but don't expect a lot and a theatrical experience with fellow Pokemon friends seem to be a good experience.",Pokémon Detective Pikachu

Weak story, i felt that pikachu gonna be kiddos parent, i felt it from the very beginning where was the car crash scene shown and pikachu appeared in offise. They made this too obvious, no surprise in the end. Hell, no surprises in whole movie..
Awkward ""love story"" /""relationship"" between journalist girl and pikachu's kiddo. I gave 8 just because i like Ryan Reynolds, pikachu character and mix of these two. Everthing else was kinda stupid, too simple or boring and guessible.",Pokémon Detective Pikachu

First the acting from some characters was just not there and the plot was sort of all over the place. It felt like it was trying to shove everything into one movie so people wouldn't complain that something didn't happen. I just wasn't feeling it. Also Lucy was unnecessary. I will say that in the ways of effects it was pretty ok, Pikachu was cute but it really just comes down to the fact that Pokémon we're not meant to be live action. I really did want some nostalgia factor or something to at least to make me feel but I guess not.",Pokémon Detective Pikachu

The writing its good with lots of well done humor. The story works for parents and kids alike but the stand out is the Poke world. The Pokemon look AMAZING and their world really pulls you in. This film demands to be seen in theatres for that alone, but it doesn't hurt its a smart, fun film too.",Pokémon Detective Pikachu
417,annekehensley,Best game-to-movie title by far,8,11 May 2019,"Let me start off by stating the obvious: most video games turned into movies don't end up well. We've all seen it, we know it and cannot deny it. For many reasons, video games just don't translate very well into a movie's limited runtime.
That being said, while Detective Pikachu was far from perfect, its the downright best example I've ever seen of a video game turned into a movie, and I think it really shows. It does have flaws, especially within plot simplicity, but it makes up for this with visuals, characters, and creative ideas. I consider it predictable, but in a way that makes you still want to see the ending even if you know how it's probably gonna go. Its a movie that I didn't want to skip, because every second of it did not waste my time. Every portion of the movie still does use its time wisely in some way, and no jokes are forced out of complete nowhere to ruin the moment or dissipate the tension.
For a kids movie, this movie does hit a little dark, but in a way that won't freak your kids out. There are minimal scenes that I'd consider iffy for a kid to see, since most of it is cartoon violence, just more realistic due to graphic standards. Overall, kids will still like it for the action (and, obviously, for Pikachu), while older people and longterm Pokemon fans will love it for even more.
IMPORTANT: This movie is amazing, yes, but I do feel it should be mentioned that this movie is VERY geared towards Pokemon fans. This movie doesn't waste time explaining certain contexts to you, it expects everyone to understand things that usually only Pokemon fans would know. Having played Pokemon for 12 years, I have no problem with this, and I understood everything in the movie. My uncle who joined me, however, said that he barely understood some parts. If you take your kids to see this movie and don't have a lick of knowledge about the franchise, you might be lost for a while in the story. Do I think its not worth seeing in that case? No, I still believe its worth a chance for anyone to see, but its good to keep in mind that the target fanbase it panders to is more prominent than anything. Its not pandering to kids, nor adults, just Pokemon fans alike. Keep this in mind when you consider seeing the movie.",Pokémon Detective Pikachu
418,BarneyMFilms,A Good Video Game Movie?,7,10 May 2019,"I would agree to some extent that the bad video game movie trope has been broken. The film isn't great, but I think it's still an entertainment way to spend an evening. This may sound dumb, but the most of the bits I didn't like were when they remind the audience that this film is set in the Pokémon world. What can I say? I don't like Pokémon. Ryan Reynolds is the beating heart of the film for me, and the gives a really great voice over performance. Justice Smith is acceptable, and Bill Nighy does nothing, which is annoying since he's not in Shaun Of The Dead much either, but he gives one of the best performances in that film. So I did like Detective Pikachu, but the ending... the ending sucks. I'll leave it at that... oh man Sonic's gonna suck!",Pokémon Detective Pikachu

Ryan Reynolds Pikachu is genuinely funny, plus the animation is on point as well which overall helps the film to be engaging and a good watch for all the family. By no means is it perfect (acting, story arcs, the way the story is connected and paced, scripting, at moments whether the movie makes any sense at all... ) but I think most people will agree it's forgivable for the overall total output.Good film!",Pokémon Detective Pikachu

When it came to the story I thought that it did a very good job of engaging the audience in especially with the humorous parts of the film, it had me laughing to my self a numerous of times and I was able to understand the film from beginning till end.Overall if you are a fan of Pickachu and the overall Pokemon world this is a fantastic film to watch and I recommend it to all ages.",Pokémon Detective Pikachu

424,pwbeatty,great Video-Game Adaptation (But Has Room For Improvement),7,15 August 2020,"'Pokémon Detective Pikachu' Stars Ryan Reynolds and is directed by Rob Letterman, and is an adaptation of the video game also named 'Detective Pikachu' centered around a crime mystery starring the most famous Pokémon, Pikachu.When I first heard about Warner Bros developing a Pokémon film, I immediately had red flags. Not only due to the news around this film being released around the same time as Pokémon Go! started to catch popularity. It all seemed like a very rush to production cash grab that I was NOT looking forward to. But then the announcement that Ryan Reynolds would be voicing Pikachu 'Peeka'd' my interest (I'll see myself out, thank you.) While 'Detective Pikachu' isn't a groundbreaking film, It's arguably the best video game adaptation to come out and is actually a really fun adventure for adults and kids alike!I loved how much care and effort was put into building the Pokémon world and all the Pokémon we were able to see. Being a kid growing up with the original Pokémon Gameboy games, it was a nostalgic blast to actually see a REAL Poke-Ball being thrown at a realistic looking Pokémon. How integrated and lived in the world felt was great, the animation and designs for all the Pokémon were very true to the games and looked great. The jokes and the interplay with the Pokémon worked great, I think Mr. Mime is a scene-stealer with a very funny scene with him Pikachu and the human character Time Goodman (played by Justice Smith), who is investigating the disappearance of his detective father.For the most part I was pretty engaged with the story for the first half of the film, but during the second half, it tends to tip more towards pleasing the movies intended audience, kids. The story is fairly over explained, and the mystery gets to be pretty predictable but that is where I had to realize I am not this films demographic. Sure, they catered to the 27 yr white male sweaty boiis that convinced an entire studio to change the look of another mildly anticipated video game adaptation for the most part. But It won't fully satisfy a die-hard Pokémon fan, because it isn't really for them.. yet (hoping for a grittier sequel).Ryan Reynolds did great work voicing Pikachu. He brought a lot of heart and humor to the story, and had great back and forth with Smith's character. For myself, I think this is one of if the the best video game adaptation we have seen yet, and I hope that assuming they choose to continue in this world, that they now can funny commit to a story that can be for an older crowd that grew up with the games.",Pokémon Detective Pikachu
425,manga-th,Better than Endgame,10,7 May 2019,"Best video game movie ever made. As someone who grew up watching the Pokemon show on TV I absolutely adored the movie. You can enjoy it even if you're not familiar with this universe.

436,abbeley,"Amazing CGI, terrible ""plot""",2,21 May 2019,"My personal opinion if this movie is that it is worth watching, but when it comes on t.v., not in the theater. The visual aspects of this movie were amazing and seeing some of the most iconic Pokémon brought to life was even more fantastic but unfortunately, that's where my positive review ends.
If you are looking for a Pokémon movie small children can enjoy, this may be a great movie for you. But if you were excited about seeing the Pokémon of your childhood come to life in an epic story.... you may need to keep looking. The feel of this movie was very reminiscent of a regular episode of Power Rangers.
With the trailers highlighting the humor of Ryan Reynolds as Pikachu, I really expected a movie that would be fun for kids but funny and filled with memorable throwbacks for adults.
The only throwbacks were the actual Pokémon and the only funny stuff was already shown in the trailers. The actors weren't great but that didn't really impact my opinion in this case.
All in all it had immense potential and I hope they try again with another Pokémon movie in the future.",Pokémon Detective Pikachu
437,glnstuff,Finally a good Game Adaption,9,9 June 2019,"Man what a blast!
As a grown up Man who played the original Pokemon back in the Days on my Gameboy and watched the Movies even as an Adult i really hoped this one will be good, and Boy oh Boy it was really good.For sure its not a Masterpiece, but it delivers what it promised in the Trailers.
A glimpse on the huge World of the Pokemon Franchise.
The Story is mediocre but enough for the purpose of this Movie, which is to show the Pokemon World in a Real Movie and not as an Anime Adaption.
It felt kinda familiar but also still entertaining enough to like it and not get bored, even when everyone already knows how the Story around Mewtwo will evolve.The End caught me kinda off guard, i really didnt thought about that scenario but it made sense then.
Only thing i cringed a bit was when Pikachu sadly sung the Poke Song, it just didnt felt right.
ITs a tune to loudly sing along with, to get pumped and enjoy it, so i kinda felt it was out of place there, but Hey they had to shove it in there in some way.
Could have been done better anyways.Also yeah, i agree and disagree with ppl who wanted more Pokemons, more to watch of the World, more of the Daylielife in that City.
But i think a Movie that would have show us all that would have been twice as long and then would be boring some where.
I would rather see a second Movie in the Poke World instead.
And i dont care if its with the same Guys then or a complete new Story Arc and Characters.
The World is huge and lots of Potential.This Movie showed us that its indeed possible to make a good real world Pokemon Movie Adaption.
Please give us more!",Pokémon Detective Pikachu
438,hniecalista,Interesting story but worse execution,6,16 September 2019,"They created a new story which is quite different from the original Anime but it has strong potential to develop and is interesting.The thing that I don't like is the way they execute the story and characters. The main leads are completely different from the Anime but they dressed them up exactly like the Anime. The plot twist was good but the flow was very rough and it didn't go smoothly and most of the time it didn't make sense. It just like they want to tell many things and finish all things in 2 hours. The film also didn't give Pokemon characters chance to develop, they were just like a cameo in this film while there are many interesting Pokemon characters in the film but they did nothing.Many of useless characters too like the Japanese detective, I even didn't know why this character was exist while had some useless scenes.",Pokémon Detective Pikachu

444,cinemaloversclub,The Next Cinematic Universe,9,10 May 2019,"A cyberpunk feel, buddy cop dynamics, majestic CGI, fandom service, & surprisingly-effective (albeit blockbuster) mystery make Detective Pikachu, despite a miscast lead actor & slow first act, a strong introduction to a Pokémon Cinematic Universe. 8.7/10....Review: Pokémon. These pocket monsters were first introduced to the world back in 1996, when the Japanese Game Boy-fueled revolution sparked the beginning of what would eventually become the Biggest Media Franchise of All-Time worth an estimated $90,000,000,000+ and counting (likely to be the first to hit 12-digits and $100 Billion after this film and promotional gear/merchandise floods stores globally). The Biology-based fantasy franchise was able to supersize itself by making smart and boundary-pushing investment expansions from its core video game series second in units sold only to Nintendo-family Super Mario, including a childhood-staple anime TV series still running 22+ years later, merchandising, card games, 7 game generations, manga, and 18+ animated films. However, what these films were missing, and what I and billions of fans have been begging for, is a live-action Cinematic Universe akin to Marvel/DC or any number of other franchises. Detective Pikachu is that proverbial rock upon which an empire can be built. A cyberpunk feel, buddy cop dynamism, majestic CGI, fandom service, and surprisingly effective mystery make for, despite a miscast lead actor, a strong introduction to the Pokémon Cinematic Universe.The cyberpunk felel and buddy cop flair. We're taken a bit off the beaten path with subverted expectations of a Kanto mountainous background with a new city setting: Rhyne City. It has almost a Blade Rnner-esque, Tokyo-swanky future feel to it that's a starkly beautiful location setting to cleverly bring in these creatures on a massive scale (while starting with the classic grassland intro for optimal nostalgia). The buddy cop interplay. Despite a slow and mistoned first act, once Pikachu and Tim meet, the rest is golden with a phenomenal buddy cop dynamics bolstered by Reynolds' SPECTACULAR Pikachu bringing his Deadpool-ish comedic delivery and irreverency/lighthearted airiness into perhaps the most iconic creature in fiction - doing him and the franchise proud while matching the film's resplendent visuals and setting. The voice work and acting overall are good (despite a miscast lead actor as I'll address later) and lend for a breezy, brisk-paced and smooth 1hr50 min runtime.Majestic CGI. Obviously the most important thing to get right and a make-or-break in a movie about pocket monsters, The animative wizardry and VFX are absolutely sensational. You feel the masterminds who brought these iconic creatures did so out of pure love and equal fandom, with magnificent textural work and blending to make them look like they're just as real as you and me while maintaining and capturing the spirit and feel of Pokémon. Throughout the many Easter Eggs worked in the film for mega-Pokémon fans from callbacks to the first film and anime arc in Mewtwo/lab to Mr. Mime (MVP in my book with a side-splitting and show-stealing comedic sequence mid-film) to Snubbell's staredown to R Serum (possible Team Rocket intro there??), nothing beats Pikachu who is absolutely ADORABLE & a masterful live-action rendering of the fluffy electric mouse straight out our childhoods.The scoring and surprisingly-effective mystery/characterization. Paralleling its impressive visuals is an equally-strong cinematic score with everything from soaring orchestral themes to a reworked Pokémon instrumental to pop and EDM by the likes of superstar DJ: Diplo to mysterious and emotive pads, the soundtrack is incredible and makes Detective Pikachu hit the sweet spot for all senses. The mystery is surprinsgly great too. What I thought might be a watered-down, child-friendly version of a hard-boiled detective film, while still no Dick Tracy or film noir-type, serves well to give even mega-fans and more grown viewers a test to piece together. Fit into the mystery is at its core a heartfelt character piece with emotion too that gives its characters strong development post-film and twists and turns resulting in effective humanization amongst all the crawly creatures surrounding them. Sensational.Two problems in Detective Pikachu are a miscast main actor and slow/mistoned first act. Justice Smith is a bizarre and out-of-his-league choice for this *massive* a role. You can sense his inexperience with occasionally wooden delivery of lines most other actors would be able to nail without problem. He is also a bit robotic and too-awkward going far and beyond the characterization intended to create an almost empathetic outlook towards him personality-wise, which I'm sure wasn't the plan and not a great choice especially when you have such a commanding central trio of characters beloved by billions at the heart of the franchise in Ash-Misty-Brock as examples on how to write your leads. Tim is fine as a character and well-developed by the end, but needed a better performance to bring him to the level of the rest of the film. Also, the first act is slow and mistoned, being borderline-boring and over-dark/bleak wholly dissonant and confusingly mismatched with its core and foundational childhood transportive tone that made the franchise such a behemoth in the first place. Of course the screenplay is not going to win Oscars and shouldn't be expected to as a blockbuster, but it's still great entertinament and the tonal-imbalance corrects itself mid to late-film despite being a problem early on as it's still finding its footing.Overall, Detective Pikachu is a home-run and serves its purpose in effectively and subvertively introducing us to the many possibilities for a Pokémon Cinematic Universe. A cyberpunk feel, buddy cop dynamics, majestic CGI, and a surprisingly effective mystery with good character work and acting make for an intensely-watchable jolt of a good summer blockbuster that is a love-letter to fans of pocket monsters. Despite a miscast lead actor and slow/mistoned first act until it finds its footing and stabilizes mid-film and onwards, Det. Pikachu is an incredible Pokémon experience that delivered almost everything I wanted as a mega-fan, while leaving infinite possibilities for future stories and franchise expansion as big as its Kaiju-esque Torterra Garden.Overall Score: 8.7/10",Pokémon Detective Pikachu
445,davewest-38619,Not as Good as i expected,7,9 May 2019,"Story is a bit boring. I couldn't believe that i feel bored during the movie because i am a big fan of Pikachu and Pokemon. Main Actor acting is dull. Bad Guy plot is too predictable. And it doesn't even scary. For a movie that tell pokemon story, this movie lack of satisfying fighting. The only thing that got me is the ending.
Overall, i guess this movie is not for adult. It's more of a kids movie.
I give it 7 just because i'm pikachu big fan.",Pokémon Detective Pikachu
446,headheadhead-46127,The Pokémon Film I've Been Waiting For,9,11 May 2019,"The feel-good childhood nostalgia was on full blast all throughout the movie. This is the Pokémon movie I've been waiting for since I was 6 years old.
Ryan Renyolds and company provide respectable performances as The Pokémon Company tries to tread in uncharted waters, live-action film. Spoiler, they succeed! They provide a very family friendly film that has moments for a vast range of audiences, from the die-hard fans all the way to a new generation. Critically, I will say that at times the plot seems simplistic and at times the humor feels forced.
For the computer-generated imagery alone, I feel more than confident rating this film a solid 9/10.",Pokémon Detective Pikachu
447,escapeN2flixtion,Detective Pikachu Used Fan Service! It's Not Very Effective...,5,17 May 2019,"Let me make one thing absolutely clear: this film is strictly for Pokemon fans. If you don't have at least a basic gist of how this series works, this film will leave you as confused as an attacking Pokemon hit with Teeter Dance. Many core concepts of the Pokemon universe, like type match-ups, evolution, or what exactly a Pokemon Trainer is, are mentioned in passing but not explained. The film assumes, for instance, that you already know that Charizard is a fire-type and that Gyarados has the type advantage over him. And if I've already lost you with that statement, then oh boy, you're not gonna have fun here!If you ARE a fan (and doubtless you are, if this film interests you), seeing realistic interpretations of the Pocket Monsters is bound to bring you joy. The creatures have been rendered to look like they could feasibly exist in reality. Not all fare equally (Mr. Mime is as unintentionally creepy here as he already was), but the star attractions (Pikachu, Charizard, Mewtwo) all look great, and fans will geek out seeing them realized like this. But alas, while Detective Pikachu feels like it wants to do right by the fandom, once you look past the references to the games and anime, the story itself is a half-baked mess, filled with plot holes, shallow characters, unexplained details, and Cartoon-Network-style humor that teeters dangerously close to cringe.The story involves Tim Goodman, a young man whose dreams of becoming a Pokemon Trainer burned out years ago. When he hears that his estranged father, detective Harry Goodman, has died in a car accident, he travels to Ryme City to inspect his father's apartment. There he meets Detective Pikachu, and discovers that, uniquely, he can hear Pikachu speaking in English. With this discovery, the two team up to find Harry, whom Pikachu insists is not dead.The story is reminiscent of Who Framed Roger Rabbit, and it was difficult not to compare the two as the film wore on. Tim Goodman's ""partnership"" with Pikachu recalls Eddie Valiant's relationship with Roger Rabbit: Tim and Eddie are both reluctant to get involved with their respective partners, and it's only after going through hardships together that they start to bond. Detective Pikachu falls short, however, because while Roger Rabbit spent a LOT of time establishing Eddie's character before he got stuck with Roger, we know precious little about Tim before he meets Pikachu. We learn that he has a sad past (his mother passed away, and he and his father drifted apart), but we're not allowed to really get to know him as a person before the action begins. Part of this may come down to Justice Smith's performance, which I found flat, but the writing is the real trouble. The film doesn't like to slow down and spend time letting its characters act and speak for themselves. Just give Tim a brief flashback and some expository dialogue, and it's all good, right?As for Detective Pikachu, his design is cute, but he's not as likable as he should be. Ryan Reynolds, fresh from playing Deadpool, slips into this movie to basically play Deadpool again. Pikachu is a snarky wise-cracker with as foul a mouth as a PG rating will allow; most of the film's occasional curses come from him (I could've sworn that at one point he almost said ""s**t"" - the joke being that he ALMOST said it, because that's appropriate for a PG audience, right?). Outside of his nonstop one-liners (à la Deadpool), Pikachu doesn't have much personality. He's lost his memory and is eager to recover it, but other than that, there's little endearing about him. This, coupled with Tim's flat character, makes their ""evolving"" relationship from reluctant partners to supportive friends almost impossible to get behind, which is a serious problem, since their partnership is the core of the story!Tim and Pikachu are contacted by the founder of Ryme City, the wheelchair-bound Howard Clifford, who tells them that his son, Roger Clifford, has captured the legendary Pokemon Mewtwo. Roger, it seems, is the one who attacked Tim's father (of course, this is building to a plot twist - and honestly, just from this you should already be able to predict what the twist will be). The villain's evil plan is to exploit Mewtwo's ability to switch the souls of Pokemon and humans, in order to fuse all of the humans in the city with their Pokemon. I don't recall Mewtwo having this ability ever before, but regardless, Mewtwo's soul-swapping powers are never mentioned before the villain actually enacts his evil plan. Out of absolutely nowhere, the people of Ryme City start dissolving away, awakening in the bodies of their Pokemon (and trust me, even for a Pokemon movie, that's pretty out there). Of course the villain himself doesn't have much motive for this bizarre plan, nor is it explained who or what Mewtwo is, other than that he's a clone of Mew. What's Mew? The film assumes you know already.Many other details about the world of Detective Pikachu are not made clear. Ryme City is described as a place where humans and Pokemon co-exist in ""harmony"" but what exactly does that mean? How is Ryme City different from other regions, aside from Pokemon Battling apparently being taboo? Can Pokemon in Ryme City hold jobs, earn paychecks? Tim's ability to talk to Pikachu isn't explained either; the film sort-of implies that Tim can do it because he inhaled a special experimental gas, but if that's the case, why can he hear only Pikachu and not other Pokemon, and why can't any of the other humans who inhaled the same gas hear Pikachu as well? This film is definitely for the fans, but even if you ARE a fan, you may still be confused. Apparently this film was based on a video game, and maybe the plot made more sense there, but I never played it, and you shouldn't have to rely on additional media to enjoy a movie.Bottom line: outside of its fan service, Detective Pikachu doesn't have much to offer. I have no problem with fan service as a concept; it's when a movie is nothing BUT fan service that I object. Sadly, that seems to be the case here. See it if you must, but if you're looking for a little Pokemon nostalgia, I'd recommend cracking out Pokemon: The First Movie again instead. It wasn't perfect, but Mewtwo's origin story had way more meat on its bones.",Pokémon Detective Pikachu

They're good at making the live animation of each pokemon that looks like from the video game, so we will not be dissapointed. Ryan Reynolds also gave a good performance making the cute pikachu becoming not only cute but really funny.

453,liz-amin,POKÉMON Detective Pikachu is a YES FROM ME!,9,12 May 2019,"(Dont worry, this is spoiler free)'Detective Pikachu' is outstanding. Not just judging from the video-game movie side, but in fact movies in whole. A lot may disagree with me, (thats okay) but I think DP (not Deadpool) is an excellent film.Though I have some criticisms to make, the story is as awesome as the trailer promised. Ryan Reynolds did a really good job portraying Pikachu, and PSYDUCK IS FREAKING CUTEEEE!!! Also, the way that the Pokémon were designed earned respect from me. It was truly detailed as if the world actually had Pokemon living with humans now!But I do have some criticisms (as mentioned): the human characters were a bit flat. Justice Smith did a good job as Tim, but felt that he could have done more as he was playing a role in the Pokemon movie universe. Not everyone could have that! Same goes to Kathryn Newton (Lucy), but overall they were also great in the movie.No spoilers in this review, because bet the majority of you haven't seen it. So go watch it, but don't expect too much from it. Just have a good time watching a good video game movie for once!Heard a sequel is already being planned, so can't wait for that too!

Ryan Reynolds carried this movie hard, but not so hard you disliked the main character. He's quite decent.The only critics I could have would be nit picky. And general story related questions. I would have wanted a bit more travel and been able to see more Pokémon. You probably see 35-50 different types. It's fun film enjoy. Don't build it up so much.",Pokémon Detective Pikachu
455,james-jones180,A Fun Adventure,7,13 January 2020,"Detective Pikachu is a really fun time. There's a good sense of humour, fun action, and a decent mystery. However, there are a few too many twists that do make the narrative feel a tad over complicated. Also, while the leads are likeable enough there are a couple moments where they are a bit grating. Nevertheless, long time Pokémon fans should get plenty out of this film but there's enough of a good story for anyone unfamiliar with the property.",Pokémon Detective Pikachu
456,cocopunk1486,The best we could ask for,6,26 May 2019,"To be honest, given how meh the video game version was I'm impressed the movie turned out as well as it did. As someone who has been playing the Pokemon video games ever since I got my first Game Boy Advance, I was really excited to see Pokemon finally make it to the big screen in live-action form. The short non-spoiler review is that while the plot is basic and the villain isn't very intriguing, the movie is still fun and that's all I ask from Pokemon.SPOILERS BELOW!!!!
OK so the plot was VERY predictable and there were tons of plot holes/ questions I have after watching the movie. The ones I got caught up on was why do the Pokemon need to be enraged for the mind transfer thing to work? And how did they catch Mewtwo if he's supposed to be the most powerful Pokemon in the world? Those weird robot things that kinda looked like Magnemite?But I still enjoyed it. Maybe it's the nostalgia-bait, maybe it's because I have a huge appreciation for all the VFX and how well they were executed (honestly I thought all the Pokemon except maybe Machamp looked great in terms of realness and sticking to the original designs). The movie is just a fun trip for all us 90s kids who grew up loving the games and to a lesser extent the cards.My main criticism is that, aside from being very predictable, the villain was really stupid and Lucy didn't add anything but confusion (yes and I know the irony since she has a Psyduck) to the plot. Why was she investigating Harry's disappearance, how did she get so much information without anyone noticing, how did they not get lost in the woods after the Torterra thing (which was completely unneccessary and just there so the VFX people could do their thing). And was Harry's Pikachu conscious through anything that happened, or was Harry literally just borrowing its body? How come Mewtwo is powerful enough to transfer people's souls into Pokemon but it got caught by humans?I mean ya there's a lot wrong with the movie and Tim's backstory is really bland (he got Daddy issues) but it was fun and at the end of the day I'd go see it again.",Pokémon Detective Pikachu
457,Osurmak,Insult to Pokémon,3,19 June 2019,After hearing that a Live action Pokémon movie will come out i was really happy. I am a big fan of this franchise and it was a big part of my childhood. This movie didn't do justice to this great Anime. Great CGI but terribly boring and predictable story. I think they tried to make everything so simple that even the youngest fans of Pokémon would love this movie. But this movie is not made for older Audiences who want a great story. I always knew what would happen and it was boring from the start to the end.,Pokémon Detective Pikachu
458,andermic18,"A great testament, but one flaw",8,10 May 2019,Two things that take away from the movie is the part when Mewtwo was put in the truck looked garbage. The other was when the humans left the Pokémon's bodies there was a scene with many Pokémon but there was two greninja which is fine but they did the exact same motions at the exact same time it was a copy paste and was aggravating. Other than that it was a great movie I loved the story and pacing and it made me so happy to see. Hoping for another live action Pokemon movie soon!,Pokémon Detective Pikachu

Yes he is possessed by the guys dad but still Pokemon is Japanese by origin and fans who watched the cartoons which are awesome and perfect in some way.
Ash and Pikachu equals Pokemon.This was a fun movie but the story is ok but nothing like Pokemon, you should watch a pokemon movie and feel right away that it is. I didnt feel it except the pika pika scenes in the fight and at the end.
We dont want a talking Pikachu with a heavy voice :SI can come up with lots more examples but to round up.
Its a fun movie and it was a good watch, but its not a Pokemon movie.Hope we get a Ash and Pikachu movie series which lives up to Pokemon, this however idd not. a 6 * cause of the good effects and funny scenes and it doesnt borePika Pika :)",Pokémon Detective Pikachu

462,nkgenovese-1,"""Detectiv Pikachu"" squanders an intersting premise",2,15 May 2019,"This movie sounded pretty unique at first: The first live action Pokemon movie with 3-D realistically rendered Pokemon with a premise too bizarre to be real. Instead of following a Pokemon trainer as he fought to become ""The very best"", the movie would instead focus on a young man investigating the disappearance of his father with his sidekick, a talking Pikachu only he can understand.That's pretty different premise, in the end, did it turn out to be just another Pokemon films? I know this is a children's movie. so I didn't expect it to be dark or edgy, but did it literally have to go to the same place every Pokemon movie does. where in the heroes have to trust in their Pokemon to save the world?I know that audiences expect Pokemon battles in a Pokemon movie. You know, there would still be room for action in a movie that took a more grounded approach to Pokemon. The bad guys don't have to be out to take over the world in every movie: It's OK to have characters who are just criminals.Worse, this movie is more concerned with making Pokemon references than actually telling an engaging story with characters worth caring about. The story seems to halt every five seconds so another popular Pokemon can make a cameo. If you wanted to see what Magikarp or Jigglypuff would be like in live action this is the movie for you. Otherwise, don't bother.",Pokémon Detective Pikachu

467,cbobs,"A fun, lighthearted film with a couple of suprising plot twists",6,12 May 2019,"So, I wasn't going into the film expecting much. I have never seen an episode of Pokemon and the game i've played of it is Pokemon Go. However, I obviously knew who Pikachu was and could recognise some from PG. So anyway I enjoyed this film. It is no where near perfect and not one i'd immediately buy when it comes out on DVD and Blu Ray but it was entertaining. It could appeal to kids, fans of the Pokemon franchise and people just looking for a good time. The Pokemon were definitely the best part of the film and there was not a problem with their look. In fact, they looked just like their actual characters unlike other films coming out this year. (cough cough Sonic cough cough Genie) The acting was fine and the visuals weren't bad. The story and message of the film was great and some parts of it even surprised me. However, there were a few flaws. First of all, the human female character came across as annoying and her character was pretty much unnecessary. Also, the first plot twist wasn't bad. I liked the idea of Mewtu (forgive me if i spelt it wrong) being controlled and his real life self being innocent but the person controlling him should have been the son and not the dad. It would have made more sense if it was the other way around and the twist was that the dad was the innocent one. So let's talk about the other twist. The main plot twist. Although it was brave, I found it quite confusing. If Pikachu has been the dad all along, how come the Pikachu acted completely differently to the dad that was shown at the end. Maybe that's cause we didn't get to see that much of him, but he just didn't seem to radiate the same energy as Pikachu did. Also Tim's backstory was actually really good but it felt overlooked and should have been looked at more. You only really got a couple of flashbacks and that was it. However, my biggest problem with the film was probably it's narrative. There was big structural problem. Obviously, there was gonna be a felling bad and 'we can't do this' scene which is going to lead them to a new big revelation in the investigation. This came too early on for me and kinda tricked me into thinking the film was nearly over. Also, there was a cinema sin. Tim manages to get down from a huge skyscraper in the space of a minute. So, although it had a lot of problems, Pokemon Detective Pikachu was a fun, light-hearted film you could get a smile out of and your kids could enjoy.",Pokémon Detective Pikachu
468,niekgrijz,"Very Cute, ripped off plot",7,8 May 2019,"Overall a really enjoyable movie, funny and well written. Terrific action scenes and good acting, nothing oscar worthy but good enough for a lighthearted movie like this one.I have never really watched Pokémon in my younger years but I knew the basic ones, so here's a message to the critics saying the movie doesn't make any sense to people who don't know Pokémon. This is not true at all, the movie takes a lot of time explaining and showing which Pokémon does what, sometimes even a little too much. The story was very easy to follow and understand.The only problem I really had with it is that Pikachu would occasionally talk too much, sometimes overexplaining things in scenes or interrupting our main characters mid-conversation which could be really distracting. The jokes weren't really as funny as I'd expected, the best ones are in the trailers but this is only a minor issue.The plot of the movie however is a bit of a ripoff between Zootopia and Big Hero 6. In Zootopia there's the hunters and prey that live peacefully beside eachother and in this story its the humans and pokémon, zootopia was a buddy-cop movie with cute furry animals like this movie. To add to that Zootopia was also about a gas making the hunters going savage.. The mind control superpower made me think a lot of Big Hero 6 and the overall atmosphere of this movie is a lot like BH6's.Overall very enjoyable and most of all very CUTE but I wished the plot was more original.",Pokémon Detective Pikachu

I'm not joking, not hating on the franchise or anything. But this movie is not a good representation of the series. A good representation would be a movie about the actual game, capturing Pokemon and battle them out. But no, it's just a boring detective movie. And I really like detective movies! Detective movies are supposed to keep me interested in the plot and surprise me throughout the movie. This movie tries to surprise you, even thought the mystery itself is very predictable. And that's too bad because Justice Smith does an excellent job as Tim. I've never seen him in any other movies but he did a great job. Ryan Rennolds as Pikachu was weird, but I got used to his voice fairly quickly and he's perfect. Other characters do a servicable job as well. The scenery and visuals are really nice to look at, and I noticed that everything that happens throughout the movie happens at night which is really nice. The writing is leaned towards the adult audience which is nice for people like me. The problem is the dialouge is boring, and that blows. I really like what it's going for, but if I'm not interested in the actual dialouge, that's a bad sign. The fight scenes are good, but there are so little. It's alright, nothing special but nothing terrible.",Pokémon Detective Pikachu

The dialogue is witty, the plot, fun. The animation is done so well that Pikachu and the other Pokemon look like you could touch them and feel the texture of their skin or fur. I'm not an expert, but the special effects experts who have a channel discussing effects even noted how Pikachu's fluff looked so real. When it got wet, it looked wet, and as it dried you could see the individual hairs more. But that was just a small part of a movie that was so fun it left all of us smiling as we left the theater.

Just a slow plot and we don't really care about the characters or the resolution. Not sure why Hollywood struggles to bring a cartoon/video game to the big screen, but this is yet another example of a poor attempt.

When the two trailers dropped they gave me hope but after seeing the final film I was left feeling empty as if I spent money on nothing.The plot is simple... a Pikachu w/ amnesia teams up w/ his partner's son (Tim) to find him.The cast includes Ryan Reynolds (Deadpool), Justice Smith (Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom), Kathryn Newton (Blockers) and Bill Nighy (Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest).It was directed by Rob Letterman, who was also one of FOUR writers on the screenplay.Let's start w/ some of the very few positives. The first/best thing this film has going for it is Ryan Reynolds and his quick wit, which has seen him typecast as the smart ass (typecasting started primarily w/ ""Deadpool"" and a couple films before but were one of the main causes in his casting here). Secondly; Justice Smith gave a decent/serviceable performance. Lastly the Pokémon designs look very good and surprisingly translate well over from standard animation to CGI life-like animation.Now the bad... and by god there's a lot of bad. Firstly it has some of the most p**s poor writing for a big budget film in 2019. It is full of terrible exposition that ends up great if more plot holes than it set up to cover. There is a massive plot hole that'll only become clear at the end but will infuriate a majority of people. Secondly; the remainder of the performance's in the film are terrible. While Bill Nighy isn't as guilty as others he gets the standard villain (not a spoiler, it's common sense w/ his casting and a majority of people picked it up when he was announced in the film) I want to take over the world because I can (...I guess). What's worse than the villains motivations is how the movie's ignorance to the extreme unoriginality of this disgraceful attempt to have a villain w/out putting in the actual hard work of coming up w/ an original motivation. I was cringing, literally cringing during the final quarter of this film due to how much worse it got w/ campy (not so bad it's good, just bad) acting and the writing. Oh my god... the writing in this is so terrible, it's actually amateurish. The script seems to have been written by someone of a low IQ or someone who just got lazy knowing that it's primary audience is kids so why put effort in.A lot of people will sit back reading this review and say ""it's made for family's, don't be so harsh on it"". Nonetheless of it's intentions it is a movie nonetheless and I shall review it as a movie.All up this is a really mediocre film that is not worth the time when there are plenty of better written family films.",Pokémon Detective Pikachu

That's how cheesy it is. Definitley predicitive. Every part of the movie, you can see where it's going a mile away. Very cliché too.

Pikachu was just adorable and so funny. They really made Pikachu perfect, from his fluffiness to his big heart, well done! Honestly, all of the Pokemon were exactly like I pictured they'd be in real life. It was like I finally got to meet them and see them. They cane to life! Everything was really just incredible! I'm so excited to see it again!! A must-see!! Don't pay attention to the poor reviews, they don't know what they're talking about. Detective Pikachu was totally awesome!",Pokémon Detective Pikachu

486,ahorseygirl,Literally what I imagined when I played the game as a child!,10,15 May 2019,First of all... visually BEAUTIFUL. The graphics were amazing. I loved this movie with all my heart. It carried the Pokémon vibe all the way through and the nostalgia was high. I NEVER write reviews but I am so pleased with this movie and I want people to support it. I had really low expectations based on the trailers I saw but I was so happy with the actual movie. This movie is amazing. The acting is great and it is packed with humour and Content for Pokémon fans. Do yourself a favour and GO SEE IT!,Pokémon Detective Pikachu
487,mulderthomas,Why is this not rated higher?,10,15 April 2020,"I usually understand roughly why a film is rated as it is but I think this score is just too low. I actually found it a really fun movie, leaving me with the feeling I wanted more of the same! It sparks intrest immediately from the beginning. You can see the actually studied pokemon and their characteristics, it felt like it was made by fans who know the game/series. The actors were great aswell and I absolutely loved the home alone reference! The characters feel real (especially the humor) it's just a great movie and highly recommend to see it especially if you like pokemon! This is how game movies should me made!",Pokémon Detective Pikachu

It's a great movie!",8,12 May 2019,"I'm starting to think the delusional critics here didn't even watch the whole entire movie. I'll admit when I was watching the movie and it was like halfway in, I was starting to believe them, but once the climax of the movie and the ending of it comes, that is pretty much why this movie is at least a 9/10 for me. I won't spoil anything for you guys, but just go watch it! This movie truly HAS broken the video game curse and I bet they'll do great with the sequel too! This movie won't disappoint you, especially if you're a Pokémon fan. Heck, you don't even NEED to be a fan to enjoy it. I know everyone has their opinions and all but mine is different, and so are pretty much everyone else's who enjoyed this movie. It has great comedy, emotional moments, and others and while the story is indeed not great by any means, the movie definitely makes up for it at the end. No, it is certainly not perfect, but it is still a fairly enjoyable and fun experience. People need to understand that this movie actually had love and care put into it. And it's what most video game movies that are made didn't even get at all which is why they failed. But THIS didn't. The Pokémon actually look real too, especially Pikachu. So what are you waiting for? Go watch this movie in theaters! Don't believe the dumb critics cause they have no idea what they're talking about.",Pokémon Detective Pikachu
489,jtizzlejt,A Pleasant Suprise,8,12 May 2019,"This was honestly much better than I expected for it coming out right after one of the biggest movies ever (Endgame). Ryan Reynolds as Pikachu was the best part of the movie. He was funny and entertaining the whole way through. Overall, it was pretty good.",Pokémon Detective Pikachu
490,dandez88,Definitely give it a watch if you grew up with Pokemon!,8,10 May 2019,"The movie starts off with instant action and comedy. It is hard to believe that this movie is only rated PG. Ryan Reynolds knocked it out of the park as the voice of Pikachu. It had comedy almost every second of the movie. Not only was there plenty of verbal comedy, but there was also a ton of great physical comedy too. You can thank the funny looking Pokémon for that.
The film didn't have an extremely deep story, but at the same time it didn't feel like it needed one. They make up for the lack of story with great settings, think night time Tokyo neon lights, stunning special effects, and great feelings of nostalgia if you grew up watching, playing, or trading Pokémon. This movie is witty enough to be great for adults, yet tame enough to let your kids enjoy it with you. There wasn't one person in the theater who wasn't laughing.
So, should you watch it or skip it? If you grew up with Pokémon or just want to take the kid's out this weekend, watch it! It blew my expectations out of the water, and for that I give this movie a solid 8/10.
I know we are all accustomed to end credit scenes, but don't stick around waiting for one because this movie doesn't have any.",Pokémon Detective Pikachu
491,astridmagdalene,Predictable....Yawn Worthy,6,19 May 2019,"I gotta tell you, I'm a bit disappointed. If it were not for Ryan Reynolds this movie would be a flop. There were quite a few kids in the theater all of whom became bored a quarter of the way in. The special effects were neat and the movie certainly had potential.

492,foxesandmagpies,I just don't know.,6,17 May 2019,"Ryan Reynolds reprises his role as Deadpool in Toho's Detective Pikachu.I was entertained by this; it was fun to look at and actually aesthetically reminded me of Bladerunner 2049 at times... Which made me wish I was watching that instead. This film however, was only boring for a bit - but does that make it a good movie?No. No it doesn't.The Pikachu creature CGI looked pretty darn superb, but most of the other Pokémon looked lackluster at best - Mew Two had ""hips"" or something? It creeped me out, it was embarrassing, and had horrid CGI. Why on Earth the CG quality was not consistent across all of the Pokémon confused me - I missed much of any plot pondering that, it was jarring and surreal.The acting was just about passable. I almost felt some modicum of sympathy for Smith's character. The plot and ""twist"" were painfully predictable, but charming enough. The jokes were actually pretty good - I'm not going to lie, I laughed quite a few times.I (willingly) get dragged to all of this tripe with my kids, and out of all of the films I've suffered through lately (Avengers: Endgame, and Dumbo) this one was almost the least painful of the bunch. The crown for least painful goes to... *drumroll*... Lego Movie 2. Yup, I know.But... This really isn't saying much.It was (Sigh) fine. Just fine. I wasn't too bored, and there was lots of fun stuff to look at, it was mostly quite pretty and there were some laughs along the way. It's cheap and cheerful, an easy watch with the family. Shallow, but fine.I probably liked this movie a bit more than I should have, but not as much as I wanted to.",Pokémon Detective Pikachu

But a clichéd storyline, clichéd baddies are actually goodied and goodies are actually baddies, oh the character who is dead is actually alive...on the upside the cgi is good, the Pokémon battles are fun to watch and Ryan Reynolds holds it well, but even that doesn't salvage an average film.

517,mofulous,"Full of feels and fun--At least, on the first viewing",6,23 September 2021,"As the first live action movie for Pokemon, the highest grossing property in the world and one of the most well-known franchises of all time, this movie is decent--but made a lot of peculiar creative choices that I believe hindered the movie in the long run. For one thing, it is loosely based on a somewhat forgotten spin-off game instead of relating to any of the mainline games, anime, or manga. Secondly, the murky city color palette does not mesh well with the whimsical concept of these cute companions existing in the real world. Thirdly, while the witty, coffee-consuming persona of Pikachu is an amusing novelty for older fans, I feel as if it alienates what the main target demographic should have been: kids. As such, it is hard to determine whom this movie should appeal to aside from a handful of Pokemon fans.The other problems are that they brought so many Pokemon to life in this movie, but most of them have little to no importance and it's disappointing. It would have been nice if more Pokemon species got a fair amount of screentime. There is an Eevee in the movie that appears for a second, evolves into a Flareon, and walks away one more second later. And the biggest flaw in my opinion is the poor acting and uninteresting personality of the character Lucy. I really did not care about that character at all and I was surprised by how awkward her acting was.The things I do love about the film are the gorgeous instrumental score and the deep level of emotion. Even if I lost interest in most other aspects of the movie, it still manages to make me cry. The bond between family is really sweet, and the Pikachu is irresistibly cute. He looks perfect and exactly how a Pikachu would look in real life. Some of the Pokemon 3D designs look uncanny--including Aipom and Jigglypuff--but the majority look great and boast an impressive level of detail. My favorite track in the score is definitely ""Epiphany"".There were a lot of funny jokes and quips, though I feel as if it tried to hard to appeal to Ryan Renolds fans or adults in general. I had a blast watching the movie the first time, but I realized it was difficult to sit through on the second viewing and beyond. This is because it is a mystery movie which happens to rely too heavily on the shock of the twist to impress the audience. Additionally, the vague flashbacks and slow gathering of clues take up too much time and are boring to watch after the first viewing.I do not think this is a bad film by any means and like I said before, I loved it on my first viewing--I would have rated it 8/10 minutes after my first time watching it. But it has flaws that keep it from entertaining me again and again. Still, I don't regret watching it, and there were plenty of jokes, heart-warming moments, and memorable lines that really stuck with me. Overall it is a competent product with an ideal plot and great individual scenes, but other pieces of the puzzle just aren't up to par.",Pokémon Detective Pikachu

My wife and I were both laughing throughout the whole movie. The humor was witty, the plot was decent, and the feels were there!

The smooth graphics made it even more so convincing.Story plot was decent enough.Downfall in the movie would be the horrible acting.

534,sushantahim,One of the better VIDEO GAME ADAPTATION,8,14 May 2019,"Pokémon Detective Pikachu was a movie I was not excepting much from, the trailer was something that didn't excite me at all. After watching the movie I was glad that I was wrong(at least for most part). The movie was surprisingly entertaining although towards the end it does drags a bit. Plot wise the movie is nothing unique, but even with that the movie was still enjoyable mainly because of the cast who gave a good performance. The highlight of this movie was pikachu who was the probably the driving force of this movie. Even though he was an animated character the animation was done amazingly and the way emotions were conveyed in by character felt very real and as a audience you would feel for it. The cgi was very impressive especially during the mountain sequence (which I don't want to spoil). Overall Detective Pikachu is an entertaining yet predictable movie. If your looking to watch movie this weekend this movie can surely be the one to look for.",Pokémon Detective Pikachu
535,Adam_Lj,Could not stop smiling for most of the movie!,9,10 May 2019,"I went into this movie hoping for the best but expecting the typical game turned movie quality, I was proven wrong in the very first minute!The first scene put a giant smile on my Pokemon loving face and it stayed there for the entire movie. It was clearly aimed for people a bit younger then me but I grew up with Pokemon and this movie does everything right. It pleases Pokemon lovers and general audiences alike.Great story and amazing world building.",Pokémon Detective Pikachu
536,cwt-73297,First Good Video Game Movie,7,7 June 2019,"Being a big Pokemon fan since 2011 I can gladly say that this movie was worth watching. Ryan Reynolds was great as Pikachu and thankfully, there weren't really any Deadpool vibes to his performance. Justice Smith held his own well with Reynolds and gave a good performance. The visuals were incredible and very impressive. The action was entertaining and felt a bit nostalgic and it had some good funny moments too. The final fight had me grinning quite a bit. Where the movie falters though is in its story. The story is a generic by the numbers detective story mixed in with Pokémon fights in a movie where it has the potential to be so much more. A couple of the performances don't exactly hold up either. The first 20 minutes of the movie are somewhat slow, until Pikachu is introduced that is. Detective Pikachu is the video game movie we needed and it was a good call to do a Pokémon movie based on a side Pokémon game rather than a main series game. It could've been a bit better but I'm happy with what was given and I can't wait to see more Pokémon movies and a sequel to this movie in the future.",Pokémon Detective Pikachu

543,dashuv,Pokémon more than a game for childen,9,18 March 2020,"As a long time fan and consumer of all things Pokémon, I was naturally worried. Adaptations of video game are not usually very good. This movie instead focuses on a very small scale adventure adapted from the Detective Pikachu series. So it doesn't try to force everything about the games at the viewer, because there's many things that mostly only work as a video game and mostly make no sense. Instead this movie has events from the games and fans will have fun time spotting easter eggs. The performances are enjoyable and each character feels like they are indeed from the world of Pokémon. Pikachu is also very cute and the visuals are also very beautiful. You can that a lot of effort, care and love was put into the movie. It was super effective.",Pokémon Detective Pikachu
544,sammilneschool,Film Review: Pokemon Detective Pikachu,8,18 April 2020,"Pokémon Detective Pikachu is a film for all ages, and is actually very enjoyable. The CGI is great, and it feels like it isn't CGI at all. Fun fact: The scenes in Rime City were filmed in London. There is one bit where a Pokémon licks a human and spit goes everywhere. Very disgusting. Blood is very scarce in this film, and you can see a dribble of it in a car crash. I'm not going to spoil anything else. A film for all ages. I recommend, even though a cute Pikachu has the voice of Deadpool.",Pokémon Detective Pikachu

I didn't grow up playing Pokémon. But I think they did an excellent job. This isn't a realistic movie, it's about entertainment, Pokémon passion, and really good cgi. Win win in our book.",Pokémon Detective Pikachu
548,marvinandujar,"Good CGI, Needed More Battle",4,26 July 2019,"This type of Pokemon movie is what a fan like myself has been waiting for years. I was glad to see that the Pokemon were well designed and didn't look awkward. However, the movie felt like they were trying to show as many different Pokemon as possible instead of having a strong story. Also, there were barely any Pokemon battle, which is what Pokemon is mainly known for. Lastly, I was hoping to see some of the known characters from the anime. Overall, the movie was funny and the Pokemon looked cool, but the story could be better and it could have included more battles.",Pokémon Detective Pikachu
549,tristan-j_is,"A movie for the fans, but sadly not MADE by a fan",6,12 May 2019,"Not a bad movie. I loved seeing my childhood displayed in (sometimes creepy) all its HD realness. As a person who has played/grew up with almost every game and seen every show, i was a little nitpicky. A few minor details took me out of the movie. Plus the story and actors were just... not good. I recommend just going and enjoying it for what it is, and trying to not think about the game or the canon of the ""World of Pokemon"".CONS
I like Ryan Reynolds and all, but all i could hear was Deadpool... or every character he has played in any movie ever. Not the best choice for this movie, in my opinion.They had the oppurtunity to show SO MANY different Pokemon, yet I just kept seeing the same ones over and over.No Joy!?No Jenny!?No Pokemarts or Pokecenters!?The world feels underdeveloped from a narrative creation standpoint. I was never convinced Pokemon actually lived in any of these environments they showed. Massive Pokemon, only human sized doors in most places despite huge pokemon standing nearby. Stuff like that.Pokemon sounds are weird. Im sure a lot may have liked it. But Bulbasaur literally sounded like a toddler... a baby... I wasn't digging it.",Pokémon Detective Pikachu

554,abdo_matrix-10940,Good movie but could be better if they made the following.,4,7 June 2019,"This is a good movie, but for the first movie talk about Pokemon I preferred if they talked more about the origin of Pokemon, how the humans control the Pokemon through the ball ..etc. The second should be only taking about the battles between Pokemon and the main character traying to win using different Pokemons with different strategy and traying to hunt new Pokemon for the biggest battles...etc.
But the way which they started this world says that the future of this world will not be at the required level.",Pokémon Detective Pikachu
555,gb-76038,Quite empty,4,11 April 2020,"The film lacks a decent narrative and the majority of the cast is forgettable at best. It seems to be a film more focused on setting up CGI action pieces (admittedly pretty decent action pieces) rather than telling a story or giving the characters real depth. Ryan Reynolds is alright in it but as he does the exact same voice and a similar persona to Deadpool it makes for an underwhelming performance because it invites comparison to a far better performance of his, obviously this is in part because of the lack of PG restraints on Deadpool compared to Pikachu",Pokémon Detective Pikachu
556,charlieball-75397,Very Confusing and Boring,5,20 May 2019,"As someone who never grew up watching Pokemon, I can't say I enjoyed this film, it dragged in moments and felt like every Pokemon was crammed into it for fan satisfaction, but was overall a dry storyline, my favourite character by far was psyduck, purely because of the interesting comic relief I felt he brought to the film, other than that, if you're not a Pokemon fan I wouldn't recommend",Pokémon Detective Pikachu

559,samarthsehgal,Ryan Reynolds did what he does best!,6,12 May 2019,"With this, I think Ryan Reynolds is back at what he does best, and I don't mean Deadpool. He is back at choosing lousy scripts :) The movie is nothing more than a desperate attempt to bring back some nostalgic pokemon moments. The writing was lazy, there were many plot holes, it was a short length movie but still felt like it was stretched unnecessarily. The only punches you'll find in the movie will be the one you watched in the trailer. Justice Smith did justice to his role, i have no complaints in regard to his acting and the supporting roles were good too. It may be a good movie for your kids or neice/nephews to watch, but for someone like me, it didn't really feel like a value for money. The vfx too were just okayish and there were many scenes i felt they skipped the exact moment just to save visual costs. Overall, the movie can be skipped. You can watch it later once it comes on tv or some online streaming site. 3/5 stars from my side.",Pokémon Detective Pikachu

564,chhablaniharshit,Watch at your own risk.,6,14 May 2019,"For someone who has always loved Pokémon throughout his childhood, this movie was a bit on the disappointing side. The movie had nothing of the sort like every Pokémon fan has lived with through his childhood, but instead shows a story of how Tim (Justice Smith) and Pikachu team up to find his Dad after his pronounced death. Tim as a character was well crafted, but the supporting cast didn't have much to do. The movie would have been a huge disappointment had it not been for how Reynold portrayed the back-stage of one of the most loved and acclaimed character of all times, Pikachu and some of the twists, though majority of them being already anticipated. I would wait for the sequel already announced by the makers in hope that they do all the justice to one of the most celebrated animated series of our childhood.",Pokémon Detective Pikachu

567,ewagaman,Video Game Movie Done Right,6,10 May 2019,"My expectations were very low for this movie. If you have ever seen a movie based on a video game, you would do the same.Justice Smith fails to show any sort of real emotion or life in this movie. His time is coming, this movie just wasn't his moment. Ryan Reynolds made the movie as Pikachu. His humor is comparable to that from his most notable character, Deadpool. Witty jokes for all age groups. He nailed it.Detective Pikachu is filled with twists and turns that are not expected. The whole theater walked out when the credits began just floored at what they saw. We were all legitimately impressed with the writing and story. Very impressed!Set your expectations low going into Detective Pikachu and you might just be blown away by this nostalgic film filled with your favorite Pokémon's and classic Pokémon soundtrack!",Pokémon Detective Pikachu

It is unlike anything you'd expect from a Pokemon movie, and for that it is amazing.

570,cyclone-41819,"Non fans will tolerate it, fans will probably love it.",7,11 May 2019,"As a non-Pokemon fan (I have seen a few of the anime episodes a long time ago, but never played the games), it was a mixed bag.On the positives,Ryan Reynolds was great and bumped up my rating a full star alone. The CG was decent - not Alita Battle Angel quality - but passable, and the world building was nice with the wide variety of Pokemon (which I suspect the fans will really love). On top of that I have to give props to movies like this and taking risks to do CG/real world mixing and creating new, non-earth-like worlds for us to enjoy - I really like and respect that.On the cons side, the other actors were less than ideal (including the main character) making the start of the movie (before Pikachu's appearance) rather bland, the story was average, and the epileptic cameraman filming the movie's action scenes during an earthquake was a bad idea.Overall, it's interesting enough to see, but probably better to wait for a cheap movie night. The best anime adaptation remains Alita (but that's for older audiences), but Detective Pikachu at least doesn't reverse the trend.",Pokémon Detective Pikachu
571,grassflakes,A Must Watch and A Dream Come True for Pokemon Fans,7,12 May 2019,"""Pika Pika!"" You heard it, Detective Pikachu is a show that lives off its source material and takes it to familiar yet entertaining directions. First off, the CG Pokemon, they look great, their sounds and actions from the dopey duck Psyduck to the happy and angry mokey-like Aipoms. They create a sense of wonder to the world. Kids will like this one, it's a fun family movie, I remember the whole audience giggling with Psyduck, the crybaby Cubone and especially, you got it, Pika-nolds. However, if you aren't a fan of the series or are new and not too tolerable with CG monsters or PG stories that ain't too complex, I couldn't say more for the adults.Ryme City is a great mix of New York and Tokyo. It uses its worldbuilding with a ""show, not tell"" approach and it works. Taking lead is your titular character voiced by Ryan Reynolds and Tim Goodman played by Justice Smith. They play their roles quite well. I see quite a future ahead for Justice. If you didn't like Ryan's voice, that's okay, I was skeptical too but after the movie I realized he actually adds a sense of fun to the character, the movie would be more boring without him, and his role is justified by the movie's end. Some popular OST's from the original series, they brought em back. If you know them, you will either smile or even hum along.What I found issue was a certain Pokemon's voice being hard to comprehend and the plot, despite trying to let the audience play detective, the movie is actually predictable. The characters could have been expanded more. However, by the end, I HIGHLY recommend it to Pokemon Fans, new and old. Though the oldies need a bit of catching up to know which Pokemon is that. They don't have everyone though and I think that's for the best. Gotta milk that cash cow, to allow more Pokemon for more stories ahead and as a fan, wouldn't mind helping my beloved series. Speaking of more stories, the ending is actually quite conclusive and a bit touching if you ask me. This movie is basically a love letter to the players and quite an advertisement to lure in new players and probably bring back ones that have jumped ship. To those who have played the games or watched the Pokemon series, there are references guaranteed, so don't miss them.In the end, Detective Pikachu is the best video game adaption so far and i'm really hoping for a sequel, if not for the story or characters, would just watch to see more of these critters adapted onscreen. We gotta see 'em all. So..Ditto, as a fan 10/10 but as a new viewer probably a low 7/10 due to the reasons I stated above and I believe i'm being generous. If you are not enjoying, then might as well, absorb the eye candy tossed right before your very eyes. I know it was my destiny, viewer, would it be the same for you?",Pokémon Detective Pikachu
572,nyanya-52555,Shockingly Good,10,19 May 2019,"Wow what a sleeper of a film. I expected to be modestly entertained but left quite shocked that I actually really enjoyed this.Instead of following the plot of the game it takes place in the future and has a totally original story that isn't based around training and fighting pokemon.This is actually a good thing, since at it's heart Pokemon is about taming animals and getting them to battle until one is knocked out and placed back in its ball only to be resurrected at a Pokemon centre and forced to do it all again over and over until the end of it's life. I can't really see many people getting on board with the hero with a tale based on such goals.I'm not putting in any spoilers but it has a few twists and turns and does a wonderful homage to its origins, the CGI on most of the Pokemon is quite lovely too. Definitely worth a watch.",Pokémon Detective Pikachu

Ryan Reynolds as Pickachu was HILARIOUS! Me and my sister was cracking up with laughter every time he spoke!I designs on the Pokemon in this movie is beautiful, I love the details in the furr that they used for the Pokemon, and they stuck to the original designs as much as they can (unlike OTHER movies... *coughs* Sonic Trailer).I personally think that they tried to put in a lot of effort for this movie and it pretty much paid off.

Ryan Reynolds as pikachu is absolutely an amazing fit. Justice Smith is also very good. The plot is really fun and interesting to follow along with as well.As someone who grew up with Pokémon this movie captures what made the games so great.

This is the best video game movie of all time IMO!,Pokémon Detective Pikachu
583,arnabkarmakar664,A nostalgic journey down the memory lane,7,22 May 2019,"Detective Pikachu from the world's largest media franchise delivers a visually stunning rendition of the ""Pokemon world"" in the form of Ryme city. It is an embodiment of the Pokemon world that my 10 year old self fancied and always craved to be a part of . This is as close as it can get to reality. The city along with its neon lights, bright colours, buzz, exuberance, skyscrapers and pokemons integrated into the mainstream social life produces a magical mesmerizing appearance on the big screen. The movie is interspersed with numerous references to the pokemon anime which compels you to get aboard the hype train and take the nostalgic trip down the memory lane.As the name suggests, the movie focuses on Ryan Reynolds' depiction of Detective Pikachu and his amazing rendition and expressions is what made the film so enjoyable and entertaining all throughout. Pikachu's interaction with the human lead and the progression of their relationship curve is the keynote theme of the film. Mewtwo despite being present only in a limited number of scenes gives out majestic aura of an all powerful omnipotent God like being reminiscent of its role in ""Pokemon:The first movie"". The climactic battle between Mewtwo and Pikachu was intriguing and well choreographed; especially Pikachu's Volt tackle was awesome.Even with its its impressive CGI and pokemon world building, the film is held back by certain drawbacks. Even though there are issues with the plot, the film's beautifully executed graphic designs keep us diverted. The troubled relationship between the villain and his son should have been detailed since Tim's relationship with his estranged dad forms a major subplot of the film. More light needed to be thrown on Harry Goodman's involvement in the Mewtwo project. The plot is incomplete and leaves unanswered questions.

593,dogsox,Shockingly Good,8,16 May 2019,This was a really well made movie especially with the CGI and special effects. The story line leaves much to be desired especially if you are a true Pokémon fan who has seen the other movies or anime but still a lot of fun. As a big fan of Pokémon I highly recommend seeing this movie with a bunch of friends or to take your family to go and see it since this is a very good movie for kids between the ages of 8-12 I would say. Overall the movie was good even if the sorry wasn't top notch but it is an adaptation from a video game so there is only so much you can do and this was definitely the best video game movie to date. 8/10 I loved it!,Pokémon Detective Pikachu

We got to see all our original favorites Charmander, Bulbasoar, Squirtle and so many more. I loved watching Pikachu fly around on Pidgeotto just like in the original cartoon. Ryan Reynold's is hilarious as always but, it was especially impressive that he was able to keep it PG. Some of the acting was pretty cheesy but, that was to be expected in a movie targeted primarily at children. They also did a pretty good job not letting the story be too predictable, I figured out who the bad guy was pretty quit but, did not see what the purpose of his evil plan was until it was happening. My main issue with the movie is the way the ended it didn't really leave it open for a sequel so this is fairly likely to be not only the first we see Detective Pikachu voiced by Reynolds but, also the last...",Pokémon Detective Pikachu

Whst we get for our money is a largely non-sensical and yet still over used plot that seemed to be squarely aimed at the under tens - core audience, I guess - that ticked most of the required boxes but absolutely NOTHING else.

The trailer was very promising, even though the pokemon looked like oddly shaped hairy rats.Boy was I disappointed.This movie was nothing but your average children's movie based on a Pokémon setting that didn't feel anything like Pokémon at all. It had Pokémon in it, but that's all.The story was boring and predictable, the actors quite bad. They're supposed to work in grown up jobs but all look like they're somewhere between 14 and 16 years old? The ""villain"" was ridiculous with his aviators and super evil smirk whenever he got screentime. But I get it, you gotta make it suuuuper obvious so everyone understands what's going on.Btw, what kind of a stupid main character's name is Tim? That alone just feels forced. And Tim isn't even a smart one. His best moment was:Bill Nighy: This is a hologram!

601,neilvanzyl,Detective Pikachu Review,5,25 May 2019,"Starting with an homage to Pokémon's Japanese roots the title is displayed in a Japanese style font. However, after this little is done to show Pokémon's heritage. The protagonist Justice Smith is a run of the mill character. After the passing of his mother and physical and emotional distancing of his father, he comes to hate the Pokémon that he once loved. Throughout the movie there is predictable and forced character growth that Smith does little to provide any real emotion towards. Similarly Kathryn Newton has a similar difficulty and does little more than necessary from a supporting actor to further the plot. Ryan Reynold's ability through voice acting to bring Pikachu alive provides some well needed depth to the movie. As well as Pikachu's relationship with Pysduck provides comedic relief and allows for some enjoyment in the scenes with the four of them all together. The villain played by B. Nighy was predictable and disappointing. After achieving ""victory"" his body is left almost defenceless with only the simple removal of the neural transmitter standing between him and defeat. Not to mention the rather confusing and poorly explained reasoning for forcing everyone to combine with their Pokémon. Together with chemical R's role, and the limited action scenes combined for a let down of a climax. As Mewtwo is returning everyone to normal the generic finish where Smith's father was Pikachu all along remained the farthest thing from a surprise. The emotional reuniting of the two was a one man show from Reynolds. The true joy in the movie comes from RJ Palmer, the man responsible for the realistic designs of the Pokémon. Phenomenally animated and integrated into the movie they provide the important wow factor. As a long time Pokémon fan, nothing compared to seeing the realism of their integration into real life and how they could live along side us humans. It was a real treat to see how it might be to have a Charizard or a Gyarados as your Pokémon partner. The final credits provide a pleasant look back through the generations of Pokémon and allow for a feeling of nostalgia, but the movie itself was nothing to write home about.",Pokémon Detective Pikachu

611,brandony-25051,"If you like Pokemon, what are you waiting for?",9,10 May 2019,"I'm not going to lie, I was skeptical of this movie before going to see it. Partly, because I wasn't sure about Ryan Reynolds voicing Pikachu. I grew up playing Pokemon games, watching the show and all that, and had high expectations going in. I will say outright that if you enjoyed any of these things, go see this movie right now! It featured many first and second generation Pokemon, as well as the later generations, which was an absolute treat to see them in a more realistic style. They really captured the essence of most of the Pokemon. The cute Pokemon truly melt your heart, and Pikachu is freaking adorable. The facial features of Pikachu are engrossing and they convey his emotions very well. I felt that they were all very well animated. This film is, honestly, worth seeing just in that respect. Personally, I would have liked to have seen more Pokemon battles but it really isn't what this movie is about. Maybe in the future, this could be a thing? There is one scene that really pushes you to suspend your disbelief, but I'll leave you to figure that out. It kind of took me out of the moment and I think they could have approached that scene another way, but other than that it was an overall enjoyable experience. Also there is a main premise that I'm not sure has been addressed in the Pokemon series before, I mean maybe it has been but I don't remember anything like it, though this didn't ruin anything for me it may for some purists. I really don't see most Pokemon fans disliking this film, unless they can't get past Pikachu talking. Whether this is your first Pokemon movie or you're a Pokemon veteran, I highly suggest you give this movie a chance. You'll be glad you did, purely for the fact that you get to see some of your favorite Pokemon brought to life.",Pokémon Detective Pikachu
612,joshbrianhecht,"Missing emotion & confusing plot at times, but nostalgic and awesome!",8,16 May 2019,"The acting in Pokemon Detective Pikachu is hit or miss at times. In the beginning, there's a scene that should've evoked more emotion from an actor than it did. It felt less important because of that. However, this scene was sort of fixed later on. The main plot is a little confusing to follow and doesn't really explain the relevance of one character in particular who was made to be important. Why were they there?Aside from its issues, the movie is very nostalgic for anyone who grew up watching Pokemon and has heart & friendship at the core of the movie as Pokemon usually does. The CGI in the movie is very well done sometimes & other times it looks unrealistic, but given its relatively small budget, it's not bad.If I wasn't a big Pokemon fan, I would've given this movie either a 6 or 7, but because I love Pokemon, it gets an 8.",Pokémon Detective Pikachu

614,chrisncarolyn,"Good movie for kids, surprisingly heartfelt family story.",8,12 May 2019,"Detective Pikachu is a kids movie. And it's a pretty good one at that. The story is pretty simple, with a few twist and turns. There are some pretty deep family-oriented themes, which it explores. I think many kids and teenagers will be able to relate to the struggles with family and relationships the characters go through. Ryan Reynolds definitely made the movie as Pikachu. Jokes were well delivered and kept it fun. The CGI is pretty good for the most part.I didn't like how they depicted Lucy in the beginning. I don't know if this is the new trend on how to depict ""strong and independent"" women, but she's downright condescending and unlikable in the beginning. She mellows out later though, which made her a much better character. There's a lot of people explaining things verbally during the climatic action sequence, which is required for kids, but can be a bit distracting for adults. Lastly, they use the word ""hell"" quite a few times in place of swear words. Not sure why that was even necessary.Overall, I enjoyed this more than I expected.

Not a constructive story and I do not realize Justice Smith's choice to play the role, because I guarantee that he interpreted it very badly. The Pokémon were very well produced at image level.

This movie can properly delivered the characters, the storyline/plot, and also the 'universe'.People which havent' have experience in any Pokemon's games/anime may find this movie as a so-so.But for me, which not a huge fans but absolutely enjoy the game and anime of them, this movie was super awesome!I love the storyline for Meowtwo, which sadly treated as villains while in the end appeared that it actually the hero!In addition, My two favourite pokemons--Psyduck and Pikachu-- appears together in many hilarious scenes.

Talks way too much and the voice just doesn't feel right. (Pikachu even says ""damn"" in this film! One example of the way off base personality they give the cute Pikachu. Another inappropriate line they gave Pikachu , ""at this point, how can you not believe in climate change!"" I was shaking my head and shocked. Lines like these have NO BUSINESS IN A POKEMON STORY AT ALL!!) This story's really out of touch from what i was used to seeing as a kid (catch em all/Pokemon trainer/battles/badges theme) which was very disappointing to me. Along with the not great villain and story that is easily surpassed by most of Pokemon's earlier animated films. If you like Pokemon, the movie is interesting to see once just to look at the great CGI Pokemon . Thought I'd check it out since i loved Pokemon in late 90's and early 2000's.

A sequel would be even better, if they really honed in the mystery. The only part I was kind disliked was the end. I was actually really confused by the end of the movie. Like if Ryan R. was his dad, why didnt he recognize his voice. Where does that leave pikachu? Who's partner is he? Did they actually bond or was it the dad? It's just kind of cheapens the experience.

DP offers an entertaining adventure from the start of the movie, giving us a ""real life"" look into all of our childhood fantasies of living in a world of Pokemon. While the story can seem to falter from time to time, it's immediately picked back up from the joy and appreciation of the world it immerses you in.The CG in this movie does not disappoint with careful detail and nicely designed adaptions that are faithful to the games/anime. However with much of the characters being CG, this can create a sort of awkwardness between the real life actors and their digital counterparts from time to time, however this isn't something that you'll notice often if at all if you're not looking for it.The cast gives a pretty solid performance in what is arguably their biggest role yet for the relatively new actors in a movie centered around non existent characters.My final words...

It went from Roger telling Lucy to do an Awesome news story summarising the events to the world on TV (Which I felt would have been a nice touch to round it all up) then Lucy saying Meet me tonight to Tim, then Mewtwo putting everything back to normal to bringing Harry back to the end.

641,abud_danilo,Decent animations...that's all this movie offers,2,29 August 2019,"25 minutes into the movie and the only thought in my mind was: what a garbage. Utterly garbage can pretty much define this movie. I think they just paid to use Pokemon in the title to sell more because what they had shown had nothing to do with the Pokemon universe created on the anime and immortalized by the video games - nor any detective work. The story is not the same, the way people act and use pokemon is not the same, basically they just created another universe that happens to have pokemons on it too. The anime were so great and I came to this movie with such high expectations that every scene I watch I felt more and more disappointed. The way the protagonist think he is a victim of the circumstances, the way he looks at the world, the way he act and treat pokemons have NOTHING to do with Ash Ketchum, or Brock, or Gary or Misty or any other original character in the anime or in the video games. And yes, Ash can understand his pikachu but the only pokemon that knows how to speak English is the team rocket Meowth and they made a entire episode on the anime to show how difficult it was for him to learn to talk. But this pikachu just speak perfectly good English and more, only the protagonist can understand him...oof. The police job was brilliant when it comes to prove that the protagonist dad was dead as they showed him a footage of a car crash, that don't show any person on it, not even a licence plate, and then came to the genius conclusion: ""No one could survive a crash like that. He's gone, Tim."" LMAO!!! Did I mention the terrible acting of the protagonist too? Yeah, his acting is just below average for a 2019 blockbuster young protagonist. Then the hologram scene...can this movie get any worse? Unfortunately it does. So my conclusion is that they tried to make a movie to appeal to fans and non-fans, but they end up just making a boring tedious movie.",Pokémon Detective Pikachu

644,pdavey12,Genuinely Surprised,9,1 March 2021,"Watched this on HBO with low expectations. I expected a few laughs knowing Reynolds as an actor but didn't expect to be hit with an intriguing story and twists and turns that had me authentically surprised. This is a movie you'll want to watch twice. I never found myself bored and was intrigued from beginning to end, a super fun watch.",Pokémon Detective Pikachu
645,frodo-53,"Really fun, great movie!",10,4 May 2019,"We saw this movie at one of the AMC early preview shows on May 2nd, and I'm so glad we did.
Why? Because ""video game movies"" are something that historically were a ""wait til it's on TV"" type of thing - no real reason to see them on the big screen; they weren't much different than the games they came from.
Detective Pikachu, on the other hand, is an actual movie. Yes, it's set in a world where Pokémon actually exist, and this one can talk to both humans and Pokémon (Doctor Doolittle, anyone?), but unlike a ""video game movie"", the plot isn't just a vehicle for the setting. It's an actual mystery/adventure, with characters you come to care about, both human and not. Twists and surprises and feels. All the parts of a great flick.
One thing that surprised me was how I was amazed by the emotions expressed by the Pikachu character - not only did he feel ""real"" in the movie, his face, ears, body language conveyed emotion clearly and strongly. It's hard to explain, it was kind of like a cross between looking at a child and a puppy... I don't know how they did it, but when Pikachu was saddened, you *felt* it; when happy, you knew it...
Finally, I also do have to say that all of us were concerned about the ""Deadpool factor"" - which turned out to be a non-issue. Ryan Reynolds is a great actor, and like any great actor, you only see and hear the character he's playing - not his past ones.
Excellent movie for all ages, even if you're not a Pokémon fan, you'll enjoy it.",Pokémon Detective Pikachu
646,alex-hannah,Great homage to the original.,7,12 May 2019,"Great film definitely exceeded my expectations. I was at first apprehensive about seeing this with the whole 'detective' stuff, why not just make a normal Pokémon movie? But I was wrong; this film is well worth a watch if you grew up with Pokémon in the 90's like me. Very interesting to see what they would actually look like in reality.There were also plenty of the original 150 so big tick in the box from me on that front!",Pokémon Detective Pikachu
647,kieran-shepherd-horatio,Ryan did well,6,20 May 2019,"All in all enjoyable, but the plot was a little sloppy, CG was altogether well designed, but had a distracting amount of noise in parts, especially the cubone at the beginning, way more than the plate.
Kathryns performance was pretty sub par. It took me out of the movie.",Pokémon Detective Pikachu
648,small_benjamin,If you love Pokémon you'll like and appricate this movie,8,17 May 2019,"For Pokémon fans I don't believe this movie does everything to please them but, I think that's what makes this movie great. Yes I would agree that is is a ""Pokémon movie"" rather than a movie with ""Pokémon's and humans"". The only problem that I had with this movie was the humans. Whenever their story came into play I just didn't care for them. That being said they are wonderful actors and Ryan Reynolds knocks it out of the park again.",Pokémon Detective Pikachu

651,fiannalb12999,Good.....but only at the end,5,25 July 2019,"Do not come for me but.... I have only just started getting into Pokémon. Yes, I watched the cartoon when I was little, but I honestly don't remember it. I've only just now gotten into the video games. But, after playing the demo version of Detective Pikachu, I fell in love.. AND THEN I found out a movie was being made so I had to see it! Turns out, it didn't really meet my expectations.
The beginning was very slow, and I feel like a lot of things weren't as explained as well as they should have. For example, why is Tim so sad in the beginning when he is first introduced? I figured that it was because of the accident his dad was in, but then it turned out that he didn't even find out until after his friend expresses his concern for Tim.
Also, why didn't he want a Pokèmon partner for the longest time? That part didn't really seem to be explained...And (jumping to the end now) if his dad comes back and Pikachu was originally his partner, but Tim claims him as his own during the film, does that mean Harry and Tim share Pikachu? Or does the Pokémon go back to Harry and Tim either goes back to not having a partner, or finding a new one? I don't know if this question can be answered....but it bugs me.
Another thing I didn't get was how did Tim not recognize the voice of Detective Pikachu if he was really his dad all along? Was it because they had not seen each other in ten years? Perhaps, but I doubt anyone would just completely forget what their parent's voice sounded like.
Anyway, I feel like the movie didn't really get good until the part where they broke into the lab place. They were very dumb while doing it, though, going in without thinking there would be cameras or something, but I liked the action.
The Bulbasaurs leading Tim to the place where Pikachu would be healed was my favorite scene, just because of how pretty it was and how cute the Bulbasaurs were.
All in all, a fun movie with a lot of laughs, but it left me with a lot of questions.",Pokémon Detective Pikachu
652,djones0305,A fun watch for everybody,8,15 May 2019,"I've been a Pokemon fan my whole life so obviously I'm a bit biased when it comes to this movie. It's definitely not perfect. It suffers from some cheesy writing and acting at times, but I feel like those things are usually just part of the package deal when transitioning from anime to live action (ie Alita Battle Angel). That being said, I think it's important that you are able to let go of the idea that you need to be blown away and that this film needs to be perfect and just embrace it for what it is. The Pokemon all look fantastic. I think most lifelong fans will attest to that. Yes it has some cheesy and the plot is pretty typical though a little bit more twisty than usual, but the most impressive part is the world building. Ignoring all the movie things about the movie and just looking at the world they built, they definitely put in a lot of love and time to this world. I think this is what is most important. Detective Pikachu is just one plot within the world. They have no need to stick to just this. It felt like every Pokemon was there for a purpose and not just a placeholder. It really did feel like a believable and magical world, and if anything it gets me really excited about the next Pokemon movie, whether it be related to this one or not.",Pokémon Detective Pikachu
653,michal753,Pokemon's Adulthood,9,2 June 2019,"It is amazing to see how this franchise has developed with the whole generation of audience. Creators have done it with such love, respect and wise extensions, that it overpassed my expectations. Great movie! Hope that all game adaptations would be done with such meticolousness!",Pokémon Detective Pikachu
654,vandutran,Why is it called Pokemon?,3,28 July 2019,"This is NOT a Pokemon movie despite its name.There is no trainer, there is not Pokemon battle.This is some detective (boring) movie with monsters that look like Pokemons.The actors are boring, the plot is boring, the ""Pokemons"" are boring, no fight.Watch the anime or play the games.",Pokémon Detective Pikachu
655,jonralph-29694,Entertaining but forgettable,7,11 May 2019,"I wanted to love this movie so much, especially with the opening scene of our protagonist and his friend attempting to catch a wild pokemon. This immediately took me back to my childhood playing the original games on gameboy. From here the movie personally fell a little flat for me. I dislike super long expositions about every single little critique (after all it's a fictitious movie about pokemon), but I just wish they would have went more the direction of the original pokemon games, or cartoon series. I was genuinely way more curious about the pokemon world than the narrative of a lost father. I'll admit I haven't played the detective Pikachu game, so on that front I can't say much. Don't get me wrong, it's an enjoyable movie, just not one I'll care to rehash and end up buying. Overall good start to a hopefully continuing world.",Pokémon Detective Pikachu
656,mahmoudamorsy,Super fun,10,24 July 2019,"This movie is extremely fun and It didn't feel boring at anytime... It deserves an 8 for only a fun movie, but I gave 10 only for Ryan Reynolds and Pickachu.",Pokémon Detective Pikachu
657,shelby_takai,Wonderful Nostalgia,9,13 July 2019,"I went in with high expectations and left incredibly happy. The movie was like a mix of a sequel/remake of Pokemon: The First Movie, with its occasional callbacks and recurring themes. Seeing pokemon interacting with regular people-with such good graphics-was the most amazing part, and my eight year old self would've cried tears of joy at the sight of them.
The first twenty minutes was a bit slow while they explained the ins and outs of the Pokémon universe to us, but the plot picked up soon after that.
I loved all the twists and turns it took as Tim delved deeper into the case, it really kept me on my toes and invested in solving the mystery along with him! For me, I suspected the ending about halfway through, but my friend who saw it with me was completely blindsided, in a good way. The movie was the perfect experience for someone who grew up with pokemon, but even for those who didn't, it's still a great film and holds up on its own. Ryan Reynolds and Justice Smith are the perfect actors for this movie, and really made the story work!",Pokémon Detective Pikachu
658,jabezcreed,Live Action Pokemon Done Right,7,17 June 2019,"After seeing the trailer and realizing this movie had all the Pokemon wandering a real world setting, I knew I had to watch this movie. It combines all the latest developments in realistic CGI animals with the inventive cartoonish world of Pokemon to great effect. Some of the dialogue was a little cheesy and the actors were a little flat. But on the whole, the cheesiness became charming, and the well plotted adventure story kept the movie entertaining. I would absolutely take my kids to see this, and I'd see another Pokemon movie made like if the acting could be elevated.",Pokémon Detective Pikachu
659,xdroon-78574,"Heart, Humor, and Great Fun all around.",8,12 May 2019,"Detective Pikachu was an incredibly enjoyable experience. You can take this with a grain of salt as I have been a Pokemon fan since I was a young child. I never once imagined that the games I played, the show and animated films I watched could be brought to the big screen like this.But this is not Nostalgia talking for the praise, I am very critical of the things that I enjoy. I am judging this film on its own merits.The plot was pretty great, with quite a few twists and turns. As an adult you can mostly guess ahead of time but I did hear some kids in the theater be surprised so it definitely works on them. The core of the story had a lot of heart to it.The main duo of Detective Pikachu and the human character, Tim Goodman, are fairly developed and have a lot of good scenes between them. The other characters are more one note or little developed. I would've like to seen more from Lucy and Psyduck.The humor is great, I laughed quite a few times, especially at the throwaway lines from Ryan as Pikachu and a few other good jokes.The effects are phenomenal. They truly brought the Pokemon to life with beautiful CGI work. They have impact and screen presence,seamlessly blending into the world around them.Direction and shot composition was real nice, there are a few great shots that really stood out. Soundtrack was fantastic.This film has heart, humor, and a ton of detail packed into this world. It feels alive and unique on the big screen. Avid Pokemon fans will love the little details, but it has a ton to offer for everyone. If you are on the fence about seeing it, consider this my recommendation.",Pokémon Detective Pikachu

Even if you don't know Pokemon,8,19 May 2019,"You'll get more out of it if you're a fan, of course, but the only Pokemon ANYTHING I ever got in to was Pokemon GO and I loved this movie!

Seeing the Pokémon World brought to life on the big screen and not only in pure animation form was a treat and in general, I thought it was done pretty well.One of the best things I can say about the film was that it looked visually stunning in parts. Some of the Pokémon looked a little better than others, however on the whole, it was a novelty to see any of them not in 2D format.There's a good mix of Pokémon on display throughout the film, and it's quite fun to spot them all as they appear, especially those in the background of certain scenes which are less obvious to spot. You could see that the filmmakers had tried to include a good combination of Pokemon from various generations of the games, and there's some very cool game related artwork displayed as posters throughout the film; which I'm sure hard-core fans will enjoy.Where I think the film is lacking in my opinion, is in its attempt to cater for young and older viewers.Being a Parent, I've watched many ""kids"" films with young children and the beauty of the best ones is that they include different levels of humour throughout the film. Some clever humour that caters for adults, and some sillier humour that caters for the children.Detective Pikachu failed to deliver this in my opinion. Which was a surprise because after watching the trailer and generally being aware that they'd cast Ryan Reynolds as Pikachu, I was expecting more laughs. A couple of times I chuckled to myself, however I sat either side of two children in the cinema who were Pokemon fans and there was almost no laughter throughout.My take on this is that Pikachu Detective never quite made its mind up whether it was for kids, or adults and in the end, appealed to neither at an expected level.The story-line felt a little but too complicated for me 6 year old daughter to follow yet was a little bit tiresome for me, despite a few attempted twists along the way.What I would have liked to have seen is a lot more Pokémon on Pokémon interaction. Ideally in the form of battling as that is essentially what Pokemon is all about. However there wasn't enough of this type of interaction for me and even when there was, it just didn't feel entertaining enough.I'm left feeling good about what it is, yet maybe disappointed about what I think it could have been. But all in all, it's a must watch if you're a fan of Pokemon and unique and reasonably entertaining watch even if you're not.",Pokémon Detective Pikachu
664,jakefellows,Outstanding!,10,3 May 2019,"Being a Pokemon fan for many years I was very hesitant when the trailer first came out and especially with the stigma around video games getting movie adaptions that never work out but in this case THEY DELIVERED!Ryan Reynolds once again continues to deliver amazing comedy while also tugging at our heartstrings in serious moments.The storyline for the movie was great and Rita Ora was a great adaption to the movie, her part as the scientist was surprising well given the common fact that not many singers can't act but I was pleasantly happy, hoping to see her more.The movie itself has an amazing storyline that I won't give away, the real life adaptions of the Pokemon are beautiful and it's almost exactly how I'd imagine them if they were in the real world, the effects are amazing!Go watch this movie!",Pokémon Detective Pikachu

667,tommirevon,Good first try!,6,24 May 2019,"I am also Pokémon fan and I grew up with 1 and 2 generation's Pokémons. Of course I was hyped but also afraid of fail.Very likely Pokémon fans like this more than people who doesn't have knowledge about what Pokémons are and do.Story wasn't good and Mewtwo parts were mostly take it from first Pokémon movie (animated).This movie missed a lot of things why most fans like Pokémons. It's fights, training and trainers. Unfortunately there was about 5 minutes fighting which was awesome but only 5 minutes. Most of the action was just running and after that human drama. Same problem with Godzilla (2014) which also focus more about humans than Godzilla. Movie name is Pokémon then I want see them and not teen drama.They really don't give you much time to enjoy Pokémons. Camera angle and picture change so fast that you barely have enough time recognize Pokémons. Of course you get to know Pikachu and Psyduck (mostly).Very unfortunately they finished the movie with disappointing. Before final action they even give you big hint about this plot twist which ruined ending.But it was good first try or test make live action movie about Pokémons. Hopefully they make other which focus more what is the best thing in Pokémon: fights, training and trainers.",Pokémon Detective Pikachu

The end credits have all the characters drawn in a manga style, and it only served to remind me how much better this movie would be if it were fully animated.

From the beginning and how slowly the story dragged on and the Pokémon CGI sucked, no awesome battles just bland.
Went with my kids and got up and checked out a few movies as I lingered outside not wanting to face any more of this movie. If they weren't there I would have been out after the first 15 minutes.
They should have just had Ryan Reynolds at the end look all nerdy with glasses and suddenly turn into Deadpool and start taking out Pokémon and I could increase my rating to at least a 6 star. This isn't even 99 cent redbox worthy.",Pokémon Detective Pikachu

If you have any history with Pokemon, and especially if you have seen the first movie, everything makes perfect sense and is SO much fun!
I truly do think this movie breaks the video game movie curse, I really did enjoy it, but its probably not a movie for anyone who doesn't like Pokémon before they see it!

They could've had more relaxing moments away from the investigation, like a few funny scenes with Tim and Pikachu alone, or that magazine girl talking with Tim as well. I also didn't like the ending. Feel kinda bad for the real pikachu. All along, I felt like Harry was meant to stay in pikachu's body forever. It just feels... wrong.

696,aminton-80439,Very Good Film,7,19 May 2019,"Saw Detective Pikachu this afternoon at my local odeon.The best thing about the movie was the graphical effects. The world appeared very diverse and sophisticated. The Pokémon were very imaginatively and vibrantly animated/ interfaced.The plot itself was actually relatively sophisticated, and I would imagine that, although the visuals would be very enjoyable, that it could potentially be difficult to grasp for some younger audience members. However, that also means that it's a film that can certainly be enjoyed by adults too.Pikachu is portrayed in a very convincing way and makes for a very interesting character - as an American detective. Quite different from any portrayal in the original pokemon series.There also appears to be a lot of deeper symbolism in terms of the relationships between animals and human captivity, in terms of both how mewtoo is handled and the restoration of normalised relationships between owners and pokemon at the end.It is a good film, with quite a lot to enjoy for both children and adults.",Pokémon Detective Pikachu

702,seibold-02129,This was a cash grab only.,3,23 August 2019,"This is one of those few movies that has nearly no redeeming qualities and probably should not have been made. The actors must have been paid more than they could refuse, because this would be a career killer for actors that were not already established. They should still be ashamed of signing on to this tragedy. The forest scene is the only good part of this movie.",Pokémon Detective Pikachu

I enjoy the idea of seeing what Pokemon would look like in an live action setting and they delivered on that. The CGI used for the Pokemon was amazing and seamless which is a shame when you compare this to the story. The story comes across as very awkward and not engaging/enjoyable, this is a huge shame as I am a fan of Pokemon and was hoping for a better story to be coupled with the high quality CGI in this movie.",Pokémon Detective Pikachu

Worth a watch for sure.",Pokémon Detective Pikachu

706,ledgey91,Well produced but a story with a lot to be desired,6,11 May 2019,"Detective Pikachu looks and feels excellent and offers enough fan service to remind me once again why I love the franchise. The Pokémon feel naturally integrated in a live action world which is exactly what I wanted to see. The humour is there and works well the majority of the time and the casting is also great, with Ryan Reynolds and Justice Smith acing their respective roles.Where the movie falls short is a story which becomes predictable and suffers from poor pacing. It starts off well enough, creating a world which both fans and newcomers to the series can get lost in but by the mid way point it all goes a little too fast. It ends both predictably and a bit silly to the point where it felt disappointing.Overall, it's a 'strong' 6/10 but leaves me hopeful that there will be more live action Pokémon movies and whilst there is a lot of the improvement to be made, it can be quite easily done.",Pokémon Detective Pikachu

As a die hard Pokemon fan, since Day 1, I thought this movie did a really neat job of integrating Pokemon into the ""real world"".

The Easter eggs throughout were fun; the effects were really cool, and I just enjoyed the ride this movie was.",Pokémon Detective Pikachu

That's bad acting, directed on a fast pace, leaving out of consideration many acting flaws which do not help the develop of the story. It seems that the director relied mostly on the graphic effects and on the popularity of pokemon.
If actors were reacting on misfortune events without exaggerating it, it would be a bit better.",Pokémon Detective Pikachu
711,Tokyomom,Great even for the Pokemon unitiated,8,10 May 2019,"Okay, I'm in my 50s and never watched Pokemon or played Pokemon or whatever it is one does with Pokemon. But I love a good detective story so figured I would give it a chance. I went opening night and really liked it! I don't know any of the characters and didn't understand about the creatures (which are called Pokemons) but I still enjoyed it. Pikachu is absolutely precious and there were only a couple of suggestive jokes which these kind of movies are usually rife with. It was funny and had a mystery (not Agatha Christie caliber but a fun little mystery). I quite enjoyed it",Pokémon Detective Pikachu
712,octubre1987,Overwhelming disappointment,6,25 July 2019,"Pokémon Detective Pikachu is the best video game movie ever. Sadly for all of us, that's an amazingly low bar to jump.Ryan Reynolds' performance is surprisingly good (not amazing, but more than I expected), the high production value shows all the time. The CGI is good at places. But that's about it.The premise is interesting but the plot and script are horrible, full of plot-holes and extremely awkward dialogue. The main actors are average at best and I'm giving them extra points because sincerely they couldn't do much better with the terrible script the writers gave them.The tone of the movie is constantly shifting, from kids movie to detective pseudo-noir to action flick to comedy... it really doesn't know what it wants to be.To sum it up all in one line, the move isn't *bad*, it's just all over the place. I think 10 minutes more of runtime and a tighter edition could improve the quality a lot.At the end of the day and despite my hard critic I'm happy this movie exist. Not because it's good (if you didn't notice so far, it's not) but because I sincerely believe the next ones will be better. I have high hopes the writers will decode what went wrong and will give us a better movie from the sequel onwards. But most importantly, I'm excited to see Hollywood making more gaming movies, this time taking note of what worked and what not and acting accordingly.",Pokémon Detective Pikachu
713,sti-ti_sam,"Great world building, shallow plot",5,14 May 2019,"While for many fans, seeing their beloved characters come real might be enough to rate 10/10, unfortunately the plot doesn't justify such a high rating.This movie does right what so many movies do wrong.
It feels made by real fans of the franchise. Filled with inside jokes and references only fans will get. Let's face it, it's the first watchable video game movie. It's the first mainstream movie where people of colour protagonists and strong women feel natural and not forced.The design choice to have it in the same world that we know, but in a totally different location is great, because it allows to skip explaining all the basics that so many video game movies suffer from in their first 30 minutes.World building as well as the first 30 minutes are absolutely great. It's full of adult jokes, references to Pókemon games, earlier movies and other popular movies and series. Reynold's performance as a cynical Pikachu just brings so much to the table. I wish, they would have cranked up the cursing a bit, but they were probably afraid to lose the child-friendly rating.Unfortunately, as soon, as the name-giving Detective plot begins, all the magic is gone. The movies suffers from a serious case of plot armour as so many Hollywood productions do these days. There is no real ""detective"" investigation at all. We just watch an hour of plot convenience with our protagonists told where to go, what to do and everything falling in their hands etc. Such a shame, because if they'd just have invested a bit into the plot, it could have become one of the great classics we will remember and come back after years.Should you watch this movie? I would recommend it to anyone who has any connection to the Pokémon franchise, because it just feels absolutely great seeing your childhood fantasies become real in a live action movie.",Pokémon Detective Pikachu

There wasn't anything good about this movie except for the fact it was Pokemon...
Music design was awesome and the Pokemons were mostly really well made, but besides the Pokemon's design all the CG was almost like it was created with MS Paint...

Mewtwo tells Pikachu that it needs Harry's son to bring him back.But we don't see Mewtwo doing anything to Tim that might help bring back Harry. It just uses its power to bring back Harry while Tim was just standing there. Blasting Harry's car doesn't make sense too.

A lot of people seem to be giving this movie high ratings. Detective Pikachu is not without merit, but the film's good points (namely, Ryan Reynold's performance, some good humor, some nice character interaction and overall high production values) are unfortunately outweighed by its bad points (namely, a needlessly and hopelessly convoluted plot, hit-or-miss performances from the remaining cast, some jokes that didn't land, some heavy-handed dialogue and some poor character interaction, and lack-luster CGI). The film is overall inconsistent in tone; it doesn't seem to really know who it's for or what it wants to be.

Hollywood should never try to adapt or try their own adaptations of a different cultural phenomenon (Japanese here). First they ruined Death Note and now this Pokemon & Pikachu. Yes agree to a large extent that the Pokemon Game was a phenomenon in itself, however the success can largely be attributed to the now perfected marketing tactics and manipulation of the media across the world. But when it comes to the silver screen adaptation, Hollywood fails miserably to understand the regional references and cultural nuances that any story from a country carries and they try to mold the concept into their own so-called perfect AMERICAN world. Pokemon Detective Pikachu was one of such numerous attempts by the AMERICAN THINKING MIND who wants to show an Americanized version of the story. It just doesn't fit...",Pokémon Detective Pikachu

Every Pokemon character that was Cgi had its own personality and i feel that they got it spot on.even to some extent incorparating the new gen pokes.If you love Pokemon ,this is no disapointment.As a sidenote the soundtrack and instrumentals really bought the film to life ,in those moments i felt i was on victory road myself.All in all excellent because it was made well with forethought and love for the fanbase.",Pokémon Detective Pikachu

752,matthewsheldon-18846,As good as a film about Pokemon can be.,6,2 January 2021,"Detective Pikachu is a fun movie which really brings the world of Pokemon to life with a mix of animation and live-action. The film is amusing and for the most part exciting, with a fun and lively performance by Ryan Reynolds as Pikachu, who creates most of the films laughs. However the thing that brings the film down is the story, which is unimaginative and ultimately just descends into Pokemon fighting each other. This isn't helped by the uninteresting villain whose motive doesn't make much sense and seems to be evil just so that the film can have a big CGI fight at the end.
In conclusion Detective Pikachu is a fun light hearted film with some good performances, especially from Ryan Reynolds, but sadly it is brought down by it's dull and unimaginative plot. I would recommend seeing this film to any Pokemon fan.",Pokémon Detective Pikachu

Too many unnecessary acts which are irritating and making it more cringe. The movie itself showing us how to catch a pokemon with pokeball and mentioning about pokemon battle but this movie is not about it, it's about investigating his missing father. I think it's too contradictive, at first they give us hype but the story goes boring and boring. They don't even give us the reason behind why he didn't even have a pokemon partner. Also, the girl who accompany him, she is wearing a pokemon trainer outfit just like in the pokemon app. I guess she has ability to control her pokemon but no, she can't even do that. So what's the point of this? And the most irritating is, the friend of him in the beginning of the movie isn't that really important. Also the police yashida, I don't really know what's his role and his contribution for this movie. The connection among characters not that really good. Like I said before, it was cringe. In the mid of movie, I'm getting boring.

762,minimanelton,I could enjoy it if I were still a kid,2,15 May 2019,"This is exactly the kind of movie that I would have loved as a kid because I just wouldn't have thought about it. As an adult, I was, at the very least, hoping to get some kind of nostalgic feeling from watching it. Unfortunately the only nostalgia I got was from opening the Pokémon cards they gave us before seeing the movie.
As a film, Detective Pikachu kinda falls flat in a lot of the technical departments. The CGI sometimes looks fine but other times reminds me of the live action Garfield movie (there was a time near the end where I could swear I saw the lead actor's hand clip through Pikachu). The plot is simultaneously simple and confusing. The characters are inconsistent and change how they feel for no reason aside from moving the plot forward. The acting ranges from fine to bad. It's just not that well made.
If you're a parent looking to bring your kids to a movie they'll enjoy, this is a safe bet. If you're wanting to feel nostalgic seeing Pokémon come to life in live action, you will be sorely disappointed and I would recommend skipping this one.",Pokémon Detective Pikachu

764,curtislacher,a disappointment in any case,4,13 May 2019,"First I was hyped: Ryan Reynolds, the popculture-king combined with a beloved franchise like Pokemon. On paper that sounded like the right step for a formula, where you easily combine a younger and a older generation of Pokemon fans in a above average charismatic, funny family-movie.After like 20min screen time I realised that the only good choice I made, was getting the cinema tickets within a sale.
Many stupid plot holes within an uninteresting story, average fan service, an animation-style that looked like it was made on the first two PlayStation generations, unsatisfing characters with like zero understandable personal progression and humour where every 'okay' joke was followed by many more lame jokes.My greatest disappointment this year so far.
Avoid dat movie!",Pokémon Detective Pikachu

But the people who will really love this movie more than anyone are the people who grew up with the series and always imagined what it would be like to live in the world of Pokemon, and for those people, people like me, this movie is a must see. Hopefully if people show their support here it will allow more well made video game movies to be made in the future; this movie never seemed like the other cash grab movies attempting to milk a franchise, it has actual love from people who obviously care about the world they so faithfully recreated.",Pokémon Detective Pikachu

It was not really emphasize on the battle versus of the pokemon, the movie plot was more into an exploring as it match the title 'Detective'.Ryan reynold as the voice actor of pikachu helps a lot on the movie as the source of the funny elements.Extra point of this movie is i think it had succeed in building a plot movir that produce warm feeling between pikachu and his partner.",Pokémon Detective Pikachu

772,reecetackley,Best video game movie,8,10 May 2019,"Pokemon detective pikachu at first seems like a cash grab of the resurge of popularity because of pokemon go.
To the avid fans such as myself were very unsure what this would turn out to be like some of the pokemon in this movie looked strange however this is simply part of the aesthetic of the movie.The movie focuses on Tim a failed pokemon trainer with a dead end job as a insurance man. At the start of the movie it is pretty dark for a pokemon movie where it really hits home. What happens to those people who are unable to make it as pokemon trainers?Tim after the death of his mother seem to have deeply affected him and now the sudden supposed death of his father have broken him. This shows a dark bit of pokemon what is not really explored in other parts of the franchise.After going to his father's apartment he meets a pikachu that can talk but only Tim can understand this pikachuTim meets an avid reporter and blogger Lucy Stephens who wants to solve the mystery behind the death of Tim's father Henry Goodman.After going to the police station Tim is certain his father is dead but discovers his father might not be dead after all.And due to this they go on a search for his father by trying to find the legendary mewtwoFrom the get go Tim is an interesting character due to his past but his personality is a little flat. However throughout the movie we see his attitude towards pokemon slowly change.The world created in this movie is amazing it really feels like if pokemon existed in this world what it would be like. All the different jobs pokemon would help with the day-to-day activities of life. The squirtle's as fire fighters seems a perfect choice but also a nostalgic set back to the original season of the squirtle squad who worked with the fire station. This was atomousphericly brilliant!It is said that the movie was highly reliant on the comedic humour from Ryan Reynolds playing pikachu. His acting was sublime and really played well as a comedic movie.The ending of the movie was unexpected for most however I had a feeling that he might of been the dad. Just a hunch which happened to be correct. We must remember this movie was made for a younger audience who would be less likely to guess such a thingOne of the best parts of the movie were the nostalgia and subtle Hints of pokemon inside the movie from pikachu singing the original pokemon anime theme song to the pokemon cards in the bedroom. This movie clearly showed the directors were passionate about making this movie and the love of the franchise clearly shone through.In the end, this movie is a quality family fun movie where you can enjoy it whether you are 5 or 50 it is a blast to watch and a fun comedy. This movie sends a clear message about the state of video game movies that they can work if done the right way. I believe this is the best video game adaptation movie ever. From my experience on this topic it captured the pokemon experience and world perfectly.A brilliant film worth seeing again!

780,ChanDogJ,"A funny, beautiful adventure movie with plenty of love for the original series.",9,12 May 2019,"As a long-time fan of many of the Pokemon games, I found that there so much to love about this movie. However, I believe that there is a lot to enjoy in this movie for even those who don't have a history with Pokemon. Also, the games may be aimed at children but the excellent visuals and humour should mean that adults too have plenty to enjoy too.Visuals: 10/10
Firstly, the directing team were clearly not ashamed to reference the source material so expect to see lots of beautiful Pokemon models and creative ways in which they are involved with the city-life and people around them. This movie can make you feel like you're immersed in a living Pokemon world and alongside some exciting action sequences, this means a real visual treat is in store particularly for Pokemon fans.
As long as you don't go in expecting the same intense cinematic action scenes as 'The Avengers' you'll definitely find plenty to enjoy here. The scenes won't be as epic in the movie as they are in the trailer with 'I need a hero' playing in the background so giving the trailers a miss before watching this movie might not be that bad an idea.Story and Characters: 7/10
Pokemon games have rarely been known for having a deep, immersive story however the directors made a very good choice by choosing to base this story on a spin-off game rather than one of the mainstream games. I myself have never played Detective Pikachu which worked well for me as I didn't know what to expect. I was pleasantly surprised to find an interesting story with plenty of plot twists to keep the audience engaged. There are occasional plot conveniences but not enough to ruin the story. The characters and themes are also generally quite interesting with Tim's estranged relationship with his father and also with Pikachu making for some particularly heart-warming scenes. On the other hand, the villains are quite bland but better than the majority of Pokemon villains at least. Overall, there is plenty to enjoy here for both adults and children so don't be put off from seeing this if you think that this movie was only made for kids because it's not.Acting: 8.5/10
Ryan Reynolds as Pikachu really gives this movie spice. With his hilarious running commentary throughout the movie, the gamble of casting Deadpool as Pikachu is a massive success. That being said the other acting isn't quite up to the same standard. The initial encounters with Lucy come off as particularly awkward and they were difficult to watch. There are other occasions of awkward acting but for the most part it works well and doesn't detract from the rest of the movie.
If I haven't made it clear already, I really recommend that you go watch this movie regardless of your age and experience of Pokemon. Hopefully, this will be a turning point for the general quality of video-game movies. I'd this movie an overall score of 8.5-9/10 because of how well it did for a video-game movie and the amazing sense of humour and immersive world which made watching it a thoroughly enjoyable experience.",Pokémon Detective Pikachu

Even as an adult, I have played all the video games, Pokémon GO!, and even collected the trading cards. I must say everything about this movie had me memorized. My favorite thing about the movie was how the Pokémon were given emotion. In the video games and animated TV series we see Pokémon can be used for evil (Team Rocket) but in this I loved how they gave us a real life adaptation as to what a world of Pokémon could be like if Pokémon were used for evil deeds. The little things that they added from the Detective Pikachu game was brilliant! It was a perfect mix of giving the audience a touch of the old generations of Pokémon and the new. Over all it was brilliant!",Pokémon Detective Pikachu

802,lesly-,Not completely terrible,7,25 May 2019,"Detective Pikachu breaks the video game movie curse but still has its flaws. The plot feels way too rushed, I could hardly understand what was going on and if I couldn't understand I doubt kids a few years younger than me could. Just a mishmash of ideas. More world-building would have been nice too considering how exciting the ""Pokémon in real life"" concept is. The movie doesn't visually look bad and I thought Justice Smith and Ryan Reynolds were good actors (but I don't watch many movies in general so I could be wrong). I think Detective Pikachu had potential but not the best execution.",Pokémon Detective Pikachu

804,exsthd,"Awful plot, poor acting and wrong target audience",4,26 May 2019,"The majority of the budget allocated to the making of this movie must have been split between the VFX department and Ryan Reynolds and it shows in the rest of the film. Whilst the visuals of the Pokemon are great and Ryan did pull off a few funny moments the rest of this film is just boring. If I could describe this movie in a sentence it would be ""This is a film your 5 year old would watch on repeat but one that an adult would never watch on their own."" This is the biggest trick I believe WB and Legendary Pictures missed with the film was throwing all their eggs into one basket with their target audience. This film is designed for children and only children. Now I know Pokemon is at its core a children's franchise however the First Pokemon games came out in 1996 and as so 90% of the people in my full cinema screening were adults between 20-35. After my screening the general vibe could only be described as disappointment, I have never witnessed a screen empty so fast.For me the most frustrating thing about this movie is it really did not need to do much more to be a great film. With a better script and better castings for the protagonists it could truly have been something special. There are a few other quallel's I had with this film such as the boring cinematography and lack of variety with the Pokemon. However this film will quickly fade into obscurity and be forgotten by all but the 5 year old's who watch it on repeat driving their poor parents insane.TLDR: Boring predictable plot with no feeling of risk or consequences, boring wooden characters, a very basic kids movie.",Pokémon Detective Pikachu

807,OfficialWeng,A Fantasic Film for Fans! A Good Film for Others?,7,28 May 2019,"As the first live action Pokémon movie, an adaptation of the obscure Detective Pikachu 3DS game may seem an odd choice. Upon viewing however, the choice is clearly the best they could have gone for.What's great about Detective Pikachu (DP) is that it respects its source material. Many video game movies seem to shy away from theirs, often leaving them feeling hollow and foreign. DP however, embraces it, this is a movie set in the well established Pokémon Universe we have come to know and love over the last 20+ years. If you're a big fan of Pokémon this film is a no brainer! There are so many great little easter eggs littered throughout this film, and it also does a great job of not over explaining Pokémon to the audience but has enough exposition so even a first timer could keep track with what's going on, for the most part.The plot follows Tim Goodman as he heads to Ryme City to say goodbye to his estranged Detective Dad who has unfortunately passed away in an accident while working on a case. While in Ryme City, Tim happens to come across a Pikachu that only he can understand when it talks. Soon the pair begin to realise not all is as it seems, as they try to unravel the mystery of what really happened to Tim's Dad. The plot was interesting enough to keep me interested throughout but along the way things start to get a tad predictable. While there are a few good twists the main ones are easily solved a long time before the film reveals them to you.Justice Smith does a great job as Tim Goodman, a young man who feels lost in the Pokémon world, and of course Ryan Reynolds smashes it as Pikachu. Unfortunately the rest of the cast either lack in character or simply don't have enough time to shine. I was particularly not fond of Katherine Newton's character, she plays a plucky young journalist called Lucy who often comes off as very cartoon-ish and her performance simply doesn't suit the character's around her. Bill Nighy does well in his role but seeing more of him would have been nice.The CGI for the Pokémon in the movie was good but nothing groundbreaking, it can also fall a bit flat in some scenes, to the point where it became quite distracting. Fortunately the film does move on quick from this small issues. Despite this everytime a new Pokémon takes the spotlight they really do steal the show and it is magical to see them come to life on the big screen this way. This is where I feel the movie will divide audiences. While fans will enjoy seeing the Pokémon on screen, newcomers or non-fans probably won't get the same sense of wonder that it so heavily relies of for so much of its run time.The soundtrack for the film is okay, featuring a some fun and energetic original pieces. However, I found myself often listening out for new music as the film went a long and I can really only think of two scenes when the music really stood out to me. I would have definitely enjoyed hearing some new remixes of classic Pokémon music alongside the new score. However, we never get that (apart from the end credits music.Overall Detective Pikachu is a fun movie, and if you're a big Pokémon fan like myself you'll likely love this movie. Otherwise I believe it shall be down to personal preference and how much cheese you can tolerate!",Pokémon Detective Pikachu
808,laserguy-56862,Surprisingly awesome!,10,29 May 2019,"I had never seen the show or played the game and vaguely knew what a pokemon was. So I wasn't expecting much, and was only there because a friend is a fan. But wow, it was a really great movie! The effects were brilliant, and the storyline excitingly unpridictable. The movie does an excellent job of covering the basics so non-fans aren't completely lost. I missed out on some key references, but would have never known if not told. I also appreciate that the humor had both adults and kids laughing. It is tough finding a movie entertaining for the whole family. Would definitely recommend!",Pokémon Detective Pikachu

This movie, I thought it would never be filmed, so I went into the cinema, I saw this movie, there was a lot of Pokemon everywhere, just fighting and being a treasure dream. And that's exactly what the film does. The film kept its original plot.

I expected this to focus more on the mainstream Pokémon but put other not so mainstream Pokémon like Mr Mime that had a significant role in the film. The only thing that bothered me at the beginning was Kathryn Newton's acting. I kind of cringed and felt like she was a real life weeb or something like that; but that was only at the first part of the film. Afterwards she was okay anyways.

815,joacimsweb,I´m actually surprised how awful a movie can be.,1,8 June 2019,"For starters, I´m no pokémon fan. It is not that I dislike them, I have just never had a natural opportunity to dig deeper. I suppose this movie speaks to the pokémon fans out there and it does look like the fans are happy based on the reviews.However.. From any other perspective than the pokémon label (in fact, the only pokémon ingredient that have any kind of life in the movie is pikachu), this movie was bad and awful. Actually, the level of awfulness was so high that I actually created an imdb account just to write this review.Now I watch all kinds of movies - both high and low budget movies. However, I can´t remember the last time I felt this kind of emptiness after watching a movie. From a review perspective, I'm not sure if there even was a story other than the ""plot"" (A plot that creates more questions than answers).I don´t normally reflect over movies while I watch them - I´m normally easily pleased. However, this movie gave a lot of question marks for reflection. For example, the city where the movie takes place - where on earth is it supposed to be? At occasions one could believe that it takes place in Japan (despite the contradictions), at other occasions I imagine that it could be in New York.While watching this movie, at first I was engaged - unfortunately, the closer to the end of the movie I got the more I lost my interest. I don´t even remember the end and I watched it last night.To sum up, this movie was probably the worst movie I watched in several years. In my consideration, the trend where China have started to hire Hollywood actors for movies have resulted in a new level of awfulness. However, while I watch these Chinese wannabe Hollywood movies I can still appreciate the situation for what it is. With ""Pokémon Detective Pikachu"" I am clueless on how to appreciate it, for this reason my personal rating places this movie below the Chinese wannabe Hollywood movies.",Pokémon Detective Pikachu

This will probably be one of the best fictional movie I have ever watched for a kid like me with a broken family.",Pokémon Detective Pikachu

However, coming out of detective Pikachu, I actually felt like it was better than I expected! The characters are well developed and the plot is enjoyable, however you can see the plot twist about Pikachu being the father before it happens if you try, however it was still an enjoyable ending to watch. It is a well thought out clever movie, and I would happily see it again and again.",Pokémon Detective Pikachu
819,dracoplaiz,I liked the start. Was a bit sad of how it ended,9,17 June 2019,"The Movie was great. I really love pokemon, and have loved it since i was little. I was a bit unhappy about how it ended. Im a bit sad over Tim couldnt talk to Pikachu in the end, like he did in the start. I know it make sense, since his father got out of Pikachu's body. Just thought there were an good connection between the Pikachu and Tim (I know it was his dad) But still. Could have been fun if he still could understand pikachu, even when his father wasnt inside of Pikachu. Just my thought i wanted to Share. Great movie after all :)",Pokémon Detective Pikachu

Fictional Asian culture: It is usual for overseas movies, I won't mention it.
Deadpool Pikachu: Amazing. Ryan Reynolds killed it.I don't know it's because I'm used to 2-hour action movies or not, but the storyline of this movie was kinda fast-going. So I couldn't empathize it so much. It's...just an average story with no tense or sad scenes.
But I'm sure Pokemon live action series have potential, so looking forward to the spinoffs or new series.",Pokémon Detective Pikachu

Yes, some people may not like it. But the whole point of review is to have some objectivity in it. This movie has great cgi, and although some might find the plot is too ""predictable"" i think it's not considered as bad plot. It had some twists here and there. And do not forget that this movie is directed for pokemon fans and for kids all age as well.

834,Connorg-97152,I could feel it in my jellies that this movie was going to be good.,9,23 January 2020,"Pokémon Detective Pikachu follows Tim Goodman as he learns of his father Harry's assumed death. Tim heads to Ryme City to collect his father's items and to sort everything out. As Tim heads to his father's apartment he is confronted by Lucy Stevens. She claims that the death doesn't add up and something suspicious is happening. Tim disregards this and heads into the apartment. In his father's apartment Tim finds a talking Pikachu with memory loss. Tim, Pikachu and Lucy, and her Pokemon partner Psyduck set off on a journey to uncover the mystery surrounding Harry's death and why Pikachu can't remember anything. I believe this film to be a success in multiple ways. The setting of the film, special effects, and soundtrack are used in ways that truly enhance the movie.
It goes without saying that the special effects are some of the best of the decade. With the movie being in a mixed media format it blends animation with live action. Comparing Detective Pikachu to other films of the same format shows just how far special effects have come. The 1988 classic Who Framed Roger Rabbit is the first movie to come to mind when wanting to compare Detective Pikachu to another movie. Who Framed Roger Rabbit had been a product of its time, the animation standing out as two worlds colliding, flat even, compared to Pokémon's movie being two worlds coexisting into one. Looking at the CGI and acting in Detective Pikachu, it's almost as if the Pokémon are truly right beside the actors in real life. While the Pokemon do stand out compared to the people, they are integrated in a way where they are three dimensional, realistic but not quite real.
Not to say that the special effects are good only because of the year the movie was made, but cinematographer John Mathiesom has done an amazing job with his team. Comparing the movie to the delayed Sonic the Hedgehog live-action animated movie, there is a clear difference in how the animation quality can be. The Sonic movie was highly reprimanded for the way they decided to redesign sonic into a realistic character, which made the company that produced it delay the movie for another year and reanimate the character. While Pikachu was looking as adorable as ever, Sonic is believed to look terrifying by the mass public. The special effects used in the Pokemon movie are also a wonderful blend of realistic yet fantasy. When Pikachu uses his electricity powers, it keeps true to the franchize keeping the yellow hue to the electricity, but blends it into the world in a way where it would be believable.
Production designer Nigel Phelps has done a wonderful job. The setting of Detective Pikachu is a sight to behold. Ryme city is an urban metropolis where Pokémon and people live in harmony. When I see Ryme city I am reminded of New York and Tokyo, which makes the setting of the movie seem realistic and close to life. With the setting being so realistic, it's possible to feel that you could be there and it allows you to lose yourself within the film.
The soundtrack in the film mimics the feelings the characters and setting are trying to portray in a perfect way. The melancholy music playing when Tim is in his father's apartment makes the viewer feel the way Tim feels. The mysterious music that plays throughout the movie hints towards something and lets the viewer know that something big is going to happen. Throughout the movie it's constant in keeping the soundtrack perfectly representative of the feelings the directors are trying to convey, as well as having the soundtrack have seamless transitions.
Of course there are moments within the film where I do believe the filmmakers could have done better. For instance, throughout the movie it was never explained how exactly Pikachu was able to converse with only Tim. When Tim is attacked by the rabbid Aipom, he asks if a person walking by can understand Pikachu, when it's shown that they cant, he believes it to be the R gas that enabled him to. This is not the case though as others have been exposed to the gas and didn't mention the ability to talk to their Pokémon partners. The dialog in the movie is also slightly lacking. While there are some jokes in the movie that deserves a laugh or two, there are moments within the film that are obvious they are lines and remind the viewer that its scripted. When Tim gets back from the Pokemon catching excursion, he gets phone service again and finds out he has five voicemails from the Ryme city police department. When Tim announces this fact to his friend, the dialog given was obvious lines and did not blend into the movie. When Lucy reveals herself to Tim at the apartmentment, her lines were very produced but delivered in a way that made it acceptable.
Pokémon Detective Pikachu is a wonderful movie. The directors and editors convey a realistic emotional impact on the viewers through the soundtrack, setting, and special effects. While the movie could have improved in certain areas such as the dialog or fixing some continuity issues, I believe the movie to be a great way to spend time.",Pokémon Detective Pikachu

840,nick-carriker,A fantastic film!,10,15 September 2020,What makes Pokémon: Detective Pikachu such an enjoyable experience is the film's effort to make Justice Smith and Ryan Reynolds' buddy chemistry feel real and electrified.,Pokémon Detective Pikachu
841,howesenberg,It wasn't a miserable experience,5,4 December 2020,"If you're in your 30's you probably forgot about that childhood dream where Pokemon were real and lived among us. If this describes you, you'll enjoy this movie for about half an hour before the thrill of seeing this dream visualised wears off, as the story isn't all that interesting and there are many parts which are expectedly predictable.
The CGI of the Pokemon is serviceable for the most part but there are some scenes where Pikachu's fur looks blurred and really he should have been the most polished model of all.
The thing I praise most is Ryan Reynaulds committment to making Pikachu a likeable character, go watch the promotional videos he released on his YouTube channel, they're very funny and I'm glad he was the major cog in the machine of movie, Lord knows it would have run like your grandpas lawnmower without him.",Pokémon Detective Pikachu
842,paulsmith-23976,Wacky and wonderful but let down by a few bad design and casting choices,7,4 February 2021,Seeing Pokémon in real life is something that would obviously be very difficult to replicate in a non cartoon form. However some Pokemon look exceptional whilst others are completely immersion breaking with how bad they look.After a while that kind of wears off though and you get used to seeing these weird plastic looking playdough monstrosities doing whatever weird and wacky stuff it is they do. It's very entertaining to watch and has moments of brilliance.There is however one scene I can't get over. Why the hell was Rita Ora casted to play a scientist in this movie. I have nothing against her apart from her breaking of covid restrictions but in a personal level I couldn't care less. However she only had like 5 lines in the movie and they were so poorly read and acted it was literally painful watching that scene in front of mew two. Like honestly some of the worst acting I've seen and I was just physically cringing watching and listening to it. Please just stick to singing lol.Apart from these things here and there I really enjoyed the movie overall. Lots of things like Pokemon scale and appearance went out the window to suit the narrative so whatever just watch it with an open mind I guess,Pokémon Detective Pikachu

846,ZidaneA,This movie is literally what my 10-year old self was dreaming of when Pkmn first came out,10,9 May 2019,"I'm not really a fan of CGI heavy action-flicks like this (Marvel etc), but I wanted to watch this movie for the pure nostalgia. As a kid I used to fantasize about a well made live action Pokémon movie and I thought it was never going to be made, so I entered the cinema trying to go back to the head-space of 10-year~ old me. and boy was I surprised! What I wanted most out of this movie was to see an overabundance of Pokémon everywhere just fighting and doing Pokémon-stuff. And this is exactly what this movie did. I think they re-used the same Pokémons and even models a bit too much but that's a very minor critique.
This movie stayed true to the Pokémon franchise very few (if any) other video game adaptations has done. I do have to note that it feels like a huge homage to everyone who grew up with Pokémon, and I'm not sure how the younger generation would think of it. But I sure hope they keep doing them.The biggest downfall of this movie was honestly the story and plot. I didn't really care for it at all and sometimes during the more plot-heavy moments I got a bit bored while waiting for the next ""Pokémon-thing"" to happen. I'm still giving it a 10/10 just for surprising the **** out of me! Woho!",Pokémon Detective Pikachu

Side note, if the voice of Pikachu was Ryan Reynold's and Ryan was suppose to be his dad, then how come he didn't recognize his dad's voice? Also, what was the point of not revealing his dad's face till the end of the movie? The mystery was figuring out what happened, not who he was. My 9 year old said it was boring.",Pokémon Detective Pikachu
849,george-gurr,Complete waste,1,12 May 2019,Pokemon swept the globe in the late 90s. This film completed ignores the franchises strengths and made a film about Ryan Reynolds in a watered down Ted movie in a b-detective-movie plot monstrosity. Awful.,Pokémon Detective Pikachu
850,fionahuang9,Best movie of it's genre*,7,11 May 2019,"Detective Pikachu gives us a peek into what we can expect from future video game based films. As we fondly look back on our deeply scarred memories of lesser video game based films, Detective Pikachu is a perfect specimen of the abilities of now and the capabilities of the future. However, by no means am I saying that it's the best film of the year, it merely is the best film of it's genre, so far.Animation-wise, it still has a lot of room for improvement. Yes they nailed Pikachu, but if you look at scenes with other Pokemons and even humans interacting with Pokemons, very quickly it removes the viewers from the illusion. However, I do have to give them credit where credit is deserved, Pikachu is adorable, and they did real good with the bulbasaurs(!). Furthermore this is a win for the producing companies as they will no doubt be cashing in big with the merchandise sales (as I walked out of the cinema, I had a deep yerning for my own fluffy, adorable, brave Pikachu).Plot-wise, the first half of the movie felt quite forced; I found it really difficult to be emotionally invested in the characters, it was too much too soon. The pacing could habe definietly be improved, the movie didn't really start until we've arrived in Ryme city. Even then there were some unnecessary scenes that could have been removed, and other scenes they alluded to but brushed off with dialogue. Nonetheless, the second half was less difficult to follow along to, and you really get to know the characters and feel what they feel.All and all, what I took away from this film was that mistakes were made, the cuteness was adored, tears were shed, but now the bar has been set; not high but a hell of a lot higher than before.Takeaway message: I'm glad I watched it, but it's not a movie I'd watch again.",Pokémon Detective Pikachu
851,kang8690,Movie was boring,3,15 May 2019,"As much as I am a pokemon fan, this movie kind of sucked.

Even without watching the movie just from the trailer you know it's main story.In the beginning you'll know about Tim background and how he teamed up with Pikachu and the other member. And then they're trying to solve the puzzle one by one. There're Charizard that f* scary, mighty Gyarados, mega-huge Pokemon, Psyduck phsycic blast, how Cubone make Tim's life in danger, and Mewtwo in action. Mewtwo here is a character not just a Pokemon, and it's awesome. There're some twist in the movie that's very interesting and the last twist in the end of the movie is surprising.The visual animation to make this Pokemon like in the real life is well appraised. It's so different than anime but it's so amazing. I really hope that they're real, it so cute and petty. The visual animation when there's Pokemon is not perfect, you'll see some blurry in far far area of the scene but it is okay.I think this movie success to fulfill our imagination ""how if Pokemon is real?""

I didn't know this is essentially a Live Action Pokémon film based in the Poké Universe. The story, the underlying connections and constant callbacks to the 90s video games were all around refreshing.

* 7/10 (would be 6 but the Pokémon were the main draw)Met/Below Expectations.A very fun movie but I'm glad I watched it for free. I feel the only thing keeping the film from a 6 is the Pokémon being so cool to look at and see in action. The movie is almost a picture perfect copy of Zootopia. Police / Detective work; a special serum or gas that makes animals go insane (in this case Pokémon). Lazy writing but wasn't expecting much given that this will ultimately be a kids film. Some pacing issues and the emotional stuff felt too forced; less focus on human characters the next time around and more on Pokémon.
Would love to see a sequel or another film with this type of quality; but actually have more video game - related beats (catching Pokémon; training them, going to Pokémon battles etc.)
They're not real animals so I don't really care about seeing them fight and get hurt; it's what the whole series and games are about.Watch in theaters again? Maybe.Best part? Seeing all the Pokémon; Reynolds performance, and was visually impressive.",Pokémon Detective Pikachu

If you are a long time Pokémon fan you will love this movie, but if you don't like Pokémon, if Pokémon doesn't really interest you or the small chance that you've never heard about it, most of the movie will not be very interesting.
There's a lot of inside jokes and the likes. I'm not saying you need large amount of Pokémon knowledge to watch this movie, but if you need to google Mewtwo or Psyduck to know what they are, then this movie is most likely not for you.Okay, enough about that. This movie is the best game adaptation I've seen to date. It's funny, the visual effects are amazing and it has heart when it wants to. There is something for all ages. Pikachu is adorable and Ryan Reynolds is really great. The human actors are unfortunately this movies weak point. Justice Smith is good and Bill Nighy is Bill Nighy, but the rest are not great and mostly not believable (they're not terrible though), fortunately they don't get that much screentime.
The plot is good, but a bit predictable (gets a little wierd in the end).Just to clear up my thoughts, Ryan Reynolds and the Pokémons really makes this movie for me.
For me it's an 8 out of 10.Hope this helps any potential moviegoer.",Pokémon Detective Pikachu
876,rckymj92,Actually Surprised!,7,28 July 2019,"This film was great, I was worried going in to how ""childish"" this would be even though yes I know it's targeted at kids but adults who grew up with this franchise can too enjoy this film. There are even some risqué jokes that could be a problem explaining to kids if watching with them.The plot too was taken heavily from the first animated film but then twisted brilliantly to fit a live action film.Hoping this won't be the last live action Pokemon project we see although the ending tied everything up so I presume WB didn't want a further risk if this flopped.7/10",Pokémon Detective Pikachu
877,danyel-nigazy,"Good. With a little more effort, could have been great.",8,13 May 2019,"The movie is well done. Characters are very well designed; they did fine where most fail: they maintain a realist look without losing the physical qualities of these beloved creatures.Action is good enough and all that mysterious veil works very well in a very well-known universe. Also it is important to notice that Pikachu (Reynolds) does not steal all the limelight nor all the comedy.Nevertheless, there are some decisions that are consequence of lacking creativity. All those holographic reconstructions of the past are a very cheap resource in storytelling. Also secondary characters like Yoshida and Mewtwo are too plain, and their lines are constantly awful. Even Lucy Stevens feels like a waste of potential. And that scene with the moving mountains was just a filler... totally unnecessary.Of course I noticed that they take the plot from ""Fluke"" movie, the car accident, the father, everything... But I think that's OK since ""Fluke"" is very much a forgotten movie and never was a good one. (If you don't want spolers, don't watch Fluke. If you already watched Fluke, you have already been spoiled).In the end I think Detective Pikachu is good enough. To me it deserves 7.4 stars.",Pokémon Detective Pikachu

879,hiltaku,Let's be honest,6,21 May 2019,"Having been a Pokémon fan for the majority part of my life, Detective Pikachu left me with a fair amount of mixed feelings - both impressed and disappointed. The movie was not short of having stunning visuals and amazing accuracies when portraying the Pokémon world. If the visuals don't keep you busy, there are plenty Easter eggs littered for long time Pokémon fans.Despite being a treat for fans, Detective Pikachu failed to capitalize on giving more focus on the Pokémon as they often appeared to be part of everyday life just strolling in the background. I think one of the major disappointments for me was the lack of focus on a full-blown Pokémon battle which is the essence of the franchise.With all that said, Pikachu himself provided for some good entertainment that held the movie together and Kathryn Newton who plays the character of Lucy Stevens makes a very convincing Miley Cyrus.",Pokémon Detective Pikachu

894,anzela-khan,Only good for kids,4,27 February 2020,"The plot was plain dull and nothing intrigued me. Pikachu's voice was to bold for his cute appearance which ruined it for me. The movie was enjoyable but only to a limit. If I'd had seen it 8 years ago , it would've been amazing but since now I've seen what a good movie looks like , this definitely wasn't it.

896,Wasabih,Good movie... for kids,4,24 September 2019,"If you haven't really seen a movie before, you might enjoy it.
The movie's major sin is its plot: you know 90% of what's going to happen in the first 10-15 minutes. The rest of the details you can guess throughout the movie with the many obvious ""Chekhov's guns"" at the beginning of each part or scene. The writer still managed to include unnecessary plot holes in this basic story.The action scenes are almost satisfying. The problem is you never get to really get into them and believe in them, because none of them make sense, and every one of them break at least 10 rules of physics. The Pokémon world really is surnatural, I guess.Speaking of the Pokémon universe: this movie doesn't do these creatures any justice. If you've never seen an episode of Pokémon, you might just think they are either only dumb pets, or monsters.Nothing for grown-ups in the humor neither, as only a few jokes that are meant for you will make you chuckle.Not ""bad"" though. CGI is pretty good. The kind of generic movie you can watch with a very light smile on your face.And to the ""gamer community"" out there praising this not-bad-for-once movie, I don't know what we deserve, but I'm pretty sure we can get better.",Pokémon Detective Pikachu
897,maxybeechie,Legendary used embarrassing nostalgia gash-grab! It's super effective!,2,17 May 2019,"Here is a list of positives and negatives for this film:CONS:
Massive, glaring plot holes.
Unrelateable and emotionless actors.
Total genre confusion.
Plot almost completely detached from the world of Pokémon.
Constant exposition.
Mostly terrifying looking Pokémon.
Total target audience confusion.
Unresolved plot points.
Lifeless dialogue.
Flat jokes across the board.
Very little detecting for a movie with 'detective' in the title.
(And much more if I were to nitpick.)PROS
Some of the Pokémon are cute.
???I sense the majority of these high reviews are symptoms of ""I see Pokémon, I vote 10"", because even when ignoring the late 2000s looking CGI for most of the Pokémon, 'Pokémon: Detective Pikachu' is a severely flawed film with a total lack of plot, interesting characters or real conflict.",Pokémon Detective Pikachu
898,rohanbodla,You will love it if you can name at least 10 Pokemon,10,11 May 2019,This movie is just amazing and full of nostalgia. The movie has amazing graphics and depicts every Pokemon featured accurately,Pokémon Detective Pikachu
899,barasurya,"Good for pokemon hardcore fans, not so for others",6,9 May 2019,"Note: I played pokemon yellow and a bit of pokemon go, and not the other series.So I should say that for super hardcore fans, this movie may get a 9. Cause they know all the pokemon names and their traits. So this movie will be entertaining and give them that nostalgic feeling (mostly on the nostalgic side).But for those that doesn't play pokemon or only pokemon go, this movie is a challenge. Why? Cause there is no intro/info of the pokemons involved. Like at the ditto fighting scene, it is a really confusing scene. I know they put a super short scene where ditto morph and push a wheelchair, but it is on the background and not enough. It will be much better if they show like a news reporter clip about a person using his/her ditto pokemon for doing some crime, or other methods to introduce ditto.I feel that this movie tries to hard on putting as many pokemon tipes as possible (which is alot), that it forgets the real points of the movie. A lot of forgetable and cuttable scene that if removed (or changed with more important ones) may even make the movie a lot better. Also too focused on the pokemons until this movie lacks the emotion for the human actors.I will give it a 7, cause it is quite entertaining, a bit boring sometimes, and does not have that memorable impact. My partner only have played Pokemon GO and got hella confused by this movie, she gave it only a 4 out of 10, a boring and confusing movie.A movie is not supposed to be watched only by hardcore fans, and this movie fails in that. Well, not as bad as grindelwald, but still can be alot better.So in conclusion, in a standard point of view I give this movie a 6.

900,dustyhurd,Incompetence Balloon Inflated with Nestalgia Gas,3,27 July 2019,"Seemed like it had potential before the lead actor Jason Smith actually tried to act. His acting is crazy bad. Could have put up with it, but then the writing level ended up being about on par with his acting, and the rest of the actors besides Ryan Renolds were just...how do they get paid for being as bad as a random amateur plucked off the street? They all must have connections in high places I guess. Within the first half hour I was able to call out everything that was going to happen in the rest of the movie. The only funny scene (the one with the mime) happened half way through the first act and the rest was just hey remember this pokemon and look how cute it is.

The visual effects are really good, the cast is really good (including Justice Smith who I though was going to be terrible due to his performance in Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom). The twist about his father is good as there are clues within the film to suggest this, but I did work it out before it was revealed, which, in my opinion, isn't a good thing. This film also does some great world-building and leaves a lot of room for sequels or maybe even a cinematic universe. Finally, however, the villain twist is awful and brings the film down a bit.

922,alexbriandonahue,Real Bad,3,19 May 2019,"I did not go into this film wanting to dislike it, but I'm not going to lie when I checked out what else this director had done, I was apprehensive.The plot was really bad. So the obvious problem with our main character not knowing that pikachu was his father is his voice, how could he never pick up on that. And why did Pikachu lose his memory? None of the other pokemon did when they switched bodies. All that a side, this detective never even considers going to the scene of the crime, he ends up their by accident, and everything he learns, we learn from out main character in the very next scene, so one of those moments were pointless. Also the Villain wants to turn people into pokemon, because it'll make them stronger (I guess) which is easy for him to say, he gets to be mewto. What about the guy who has to be klink? I'm sure that sucks.The themes of the movie are about forgiving the ones you love, which is not really Incorporated into the main plot, which isn't the end of the world, but it's kinda tacked on.On a good note, the lighting was great. I've heard people complain, but I thought it was interesting to see how different Pokemon react to different light.And the choreography on Pikachu was very well done, it almost reminded me of Roger Rabbit, where a lot of thought was put into how he would move at any given point.At best, this movie is a guilty pleasure.",Pokémon Detective Pikachu

The changes in tone from happy, cute, and even dark provide enough depth to make your ticket worth it. However, the movie does rely heavily upon Ryan Reynolds and his voicing of Pikachu. His character is what really makes this movie worth while but in doing so leaves very little development of the supporting cast.

I have read a lot of reviews. It seems like no one comments on the research that was done for it. The fact that in one episode of the original Pokemon dito is expressionless. The girl couldnt get her dito to do faces. I love they brought that here. Then the story of mew 2. They took parts from the original Pokemon mew 2 movie.

After watch the Detective Pikachu, that tiny fragment of love just exploded. The movie was a wonderful experience and watching all those forgotten Pokèmons brings back the child in you. I won't says it's a super duper hit movie, but I would recommend everybody who loves Pokèmon must watch the movie, it has an ambience of its own and definitely take your family with you.",Pokémon Detective Pikachu

Pros:
-Awesome CGI
-Good music (especially the nostalgic credit music)
-Ryan Reynolds kills it with Pikachu
-Does not follow the usual tropes of video game movies

942,jwulfer-92977,""" Critics VS User Reviews "" from a neutral perspective",10,7 June 2019,"I have never been a pokemon fan however i did watch it with one so here is both sides of the coin in an unbiased form.
Firstly, I am an art house & cult movie fan prefer dialogue over action often in genres of this kind one would be lacking especially in the universe of video game/comic adaptions.
The non Pokemon fan watched it and i enjoyed it tremendously to an extent of a fully grown adult wanting to be a child again since it did deliver on all fronts & more from CGI to acting to plot twists there was hardly anything i could fault it on maybe the choice of main actors or the understated role of Bill Nighy, but it's more of an itch than a problem in itself, overall a great family film for young and old & does justice to the franchise in more ways than one.
The Pokemon fan i was with enjoyed it just the same though their nitpicking was to 1 specific CGI pokemon about being overexagerrated portrait to the size of a mountain & not genetically speaking that a size of a house be more appropriate, I found myself defending the reason on genetic manipulation as indicated in the film yet there is where our differences ended and what a ride it was specifically in it's genre it delivers exactly what it says it does and often elicits different emotions from excitement to joy to cuteness overload.
Ryan Reynold's delivers a respectful performance as Picachu without the crassness that deadpool brought however there is a few indicators of the lipsmacking humor Ryan is famous for but in this even as himself in the end of the film made sure the fans saw a respectful side to him afterall the film is based on a mythical world followed by fans.",Pokémon Detective Pikachu

944,lohh-38137,Loved!,10,11 June 2019,"At first I thought I was going to be silly and did not understand that thick voice of Pikachu, the end was amazing!
And the pokemons were very cute and funny! /BR",Pokémon Detective Pikachu
945,emailskijiji,Much Better Than The Trailer,10,13 May 2019,"I wasn't sure I wanted to watch it when I saw the trailer, because trailers normally have the best moments of a movie, and I thought if this is the best of it--I don't think it is impressive. Was I ever wrong. So many twists, a great story throughout the movie, great production... My kid is a Pokemon fan, I am slightly familiar with it, but we both enjoyed it so much.While I would avoid having very young kids watch it because of some characters and actions, it is sure to deliver to anyone 7 and up, including adults. Highly recommended.",Pokémon Detective Pikachu
