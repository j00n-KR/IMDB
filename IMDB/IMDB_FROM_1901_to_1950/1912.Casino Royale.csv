0,MartinHafer,One of the biggest wastes of talent ever seen,2,4 June 2005,"It's amazing that such a stellar cast was assembled and such a rotten and incomprehensible mess resulted! Think about it folks, the movie features an incredible cast of expensive talent and STILL is unwatchable. Imagaine how hard it must have been to have assembled this much talent and still produced such a dud! Other than the memorable music from Herb Alpert, nothing positive can be mentioned about the movie. It is stupid and smarmy but not one bit entertaining. It has all the earmarks of a movie that has been written and re-written and re-written innumerable times until it makes no sense. Either that, or everyone associated with the movie was on LSD or had suffered blows to the head. Whatever the cause, avoid this movie like the plague.By the way, there is strong circumstantial evidence to prove the film is a turkey even before you watch it. Look at the very, very long list of directors for the film. When it has that many, it an almost sure sign that something is wrong with the production.Additionally, look at the list of directors and actors--I can't think of another film with more assembled talent than this one, but with practically nothing for any of them to do! Imagine wasting actors such as Peter Sellers (who plays, apparently, a zombie), David Niven, Charles Boyer, Orsen Welles, William Holden, Jean-Paul Belmondo, George Raft, Jacqueline Bisset, Ursula Andress, Woody Allen (back when he was funny in the 60s) and Deborah Kerr!!! Many of these people were given nothing in particular to do except to make an embarrassing walk-on. The rest were given parts that were very incomplete and stupid.PS--To this day, Ian Fleming's corpse continues to spin like a rotisserie thanks to this film that bears the same title of one of his best books (though the title and name of the main character are the ONLY things the 2 have in common).",Casino Royale
1,TheLittleSongbird,"Disjointed affair, with some good moments",5,2 March 2011,"It is better not to think of this film as an official Bond film, because even if it was meant to be, it doesn't feel like one. If anything, it feels like a disjointed spy caper and as a spoof it is one with pluses and minuses.Casino Royale does have its good points. The locations, costumes, photography and Bond girls look wonderful, even if the editing isn't as good. The music is rousing enough with a brilliant song sung by Dusty Springfield, the opening and closing sequences are memorable, the idea is great, there are some funny bits and there is a great cast, although the performances themselves are uneven. David Niven is amusing, Orson Welles is a good find, Ursula Andress is very sexy and beautiful and Woody Allen provides some of the more funnier moments though these moments are almost too brief to savour properly.The rest of the cast don't give bad performances or anything, but the material they got should have been better. Peter Sellers's talents in my opinion are not put to good use, there are times when he is funny but there are other times where he does little more than ad libs and he does overdo it occasionally, while some of the cameos are wasted and that includes John Huston as M, who coincidentally is one of the directors of Casino Royale.What hurt Casino Royale though was the length and the pace. It was much too long and there are some parts that move along at a snail's pace. The film also feels bloated, there are too many characters and the film should have had about three less directors than it did. The film does start off well, but then it becomes very silly, overblown and pointless. The script is weak, with the occasional funny moment outweighed by the too silly, unfunny moment sadly, while the plot meanders all over the place and is very hard to follow and the action while not bad is rather overblown.Overall, I can see why Casino Royale is seen as a love it/hate it movie. As for me, I had very mixed feelings on this film, and while not terrible, it is disjointed and bloated that is saved by the production values, music and some of the cast. 5/10 Bethany Cox",Casino Royale
2,bkoganbing,You Can't Spoof A Spoof,3,14 August 2008,"Maybe the third time around someone will get Casino Royale right. Until then we'll have to deal with both the 1967 and the 2007 version, each of whom is bad in its own way.The version in 2007 that introduced Daniel Craig as James Bond was a competently made action thriller, but I missed the tongue in cheek humor of those Bonds done by Sean Connery, Roger Moore, and Pierce Brosnan. But that's a matter of taste and style.But I don't know anyone who likes the 1967 all star mess of a Casino Royale. Five directors had a hand in this film and it looks like I watched five different films in the running time.According to the Citadel Film Series book, The Films Of John Huston one of the five directors, Ian Fleming had sold the rights to this particular Bond novel to someone else other than Saltzman and Broccoli who brought us the traditional Bond films we know. Charles K. Feldman who wound up with the rights after the Bond phenomenon took off tried desperately to get Sean Connery away from Cubby Broccoli, but Broccoli being no fool wasn't having that.Failing to get Connery for a traditional Bond film, Feldman decided on the satirical approach instead. But Casino Royale if nothing else proves the old adage of you can't spoof a spoof.Amazingly enough Casino Royale actually got an Oscar nomination for the song The Look of Love by Burt Bachrach and Hal David which certainly was popular back in the day. You'll hear it sung on the soundtrack by Dusty Springfield, probably most folks are familiar with Dionne Warwick.Seldom will you ever see so many name players getting such an opportunity to make fools of themselves. But I have to commend Peter O'Toole and his agent for apparently insisting on no billing for a tiny role. They were the smartest ones involved with Casino Royale.",Casino Royale
3,Leofwine_draca,Messiest film ever,3,3 September 2015,"CASINO ROYALE, a 1967 spoof of the whole James Bond spy genre, has to be one of the messiest films ever made. A troubled production leads to a very troubled picture in which new meaning is brought to the phrase ""scattershot"". This is a film filled with extremely broad comedy, touches of surreal humour, and a general lack of both cohesion and coherence so that for most of the running time you're wondering what the hell you're watching.The storyline only loosely follows that of the Fleming novel, despite the misleading title. Orson Welles has a few scenes as Le Chiffre, for example, but what happens to him is totally out of left field. Meanwhile, we get a storyline involving a past-his-prime David Niven as an elderly Bond who recruits various newcomers to the fold, including a poor Peter Sellers. An appears-in-anything Ursula Andress is the crumpet, while the supporting cast in this bloated production is packed with cameoing stars like Deborah Kerr, John Huston, William Holden, and even one Woody Allen playing 'Jimmy Bond'.CASINO ROYALE has an episodic structure that is generally hard to watch as most of the supposed funny bits are anything but. The stuff set in Scotland is completely interminable, for example, although things do pick up a little for the more traditional climax. It's still one hell of a mess though, worth watching only so you can wonder how they got it so wrong.",Casino Royale
4,SnoopyStyle,a mess with some fun bits,4,2 April 2016,"Varied international intelligence agencies plead for Sir James Bond (David Niven) to come out of retirement to battle SMERSH. He goes to Scotland where SMERSH agents try to seduce him. Later, he orders every agent to be named James Bond to confuse SMERSH. Baccarat master Evelyn Tremble (Peter Sellers) is recruited to be James Bond to battle Le Chiffre (Orson Welles) at Casino Royale.This is one big mess. The problem is that most of it is not funny. It goes all over the place. Having both Niven and Sellers (and others) be James Bond is convoluted and not worth the very limited comedic effects. Essentially Niven and Sellers are co-leads which leaves this movie disjointed. The movie throws everything on the screen. Sometimes they go all out. There are sight gags and dry humor. However, it's rare to actually laugh. Woody Allen is hilarious but he's the rare consistent comedian. Sellers does a couple of interesting bits. It would have been great if he's the only James Bond going up against Woody Allen as the Bond villain.",Casino Royale
5,claudio_carvalho,"A Long, Boring, Messy and Silly Waste of Budget and Cast",3,28 April 2007,"""Cassino Royale"" was supposed to be a psychedelic and funny spoof of James Bond movies. The dream cast is certainly among the most fantastic reunion of stars and starlets of the cinema history ever. How many times the viewer has the chance to see names like Peter Sellers, David Niven, Ursula Andrews, Orson Welles, Woody Allen, Deborah Kerr, William Holden, Charles Boyer, John Houston, Jean-Paul Bemondo, Jacqueline Bisset, Peter O'Toole, Anjelica Huston and other less famous actors and actresses acting together in the same film? Unfortunately, with the exception of the scenes with Woody Allen, this parody never works and is actually a long, boring, messy and silly waste of budget and cast. Even watching ""Cassino Royale"" as a dated 60's movie of counterculture, the result is absolutely disappointing mostly because of the chaotic screenplay. My vote is three.Title (Brazil): ""Cassino Royale""",Casino Royale
6,gavin6942,Too Confusing To Be Truly Good,5,7 November 2012,"In an early spy spoof, aging Sir James Bond comes out of retirement to take on SMERSH.I hate to say that I did not really enjoy this movie. But based on the IMDb rating, I apparently am not alone in that. While I like the idea of a spy spoof, this one just seemed to flop for me. Maybe it was because too many writers and directors were involved, but the plot was too confusing and ran for much too long. Did we need seven James Bonds? No.Granted, we have a great cast: Peter Sellers, Orson Welles, Woody Allen and others. And some of the jokes were pretty funny. But trying to keep the plot straight was just too difficult.",Casino Royale
7,lee_eisenberg,more and more royal all the time,7,26 July 2005,"You can only appreciate ""Casino Royale"" if you're willing to accept the zany humor that pervaded 1960s cinema and TV. In this case, Sir James Bond (David Niven) is called out of retirement to solve one last case. In the process of everything, there's some gags by secret agent Evelyn Trimble (Peter Sellers) and some great lines by cousin Jimmy Bond (Woody Allen). And of course there's a plethora of hot women, namely Vesper Lynd (Ursula Andress). It's one of those movies whose whole purpose is to be wacky, and they make no pretense about that. I think that my favorite scene was in the German club...or maybe it was the big battle at the end. Either way, ""Casino Royale"" is meant to be silly, and they succeed. Hilariously.",Casino Royale
8,jboothmillard,Casino Royale,4,14 August 2006,"Made during the success of the real James Bond 007 series, and released the same year as You Only Live Twice, this all star comedy film was made to satirise the series, and loosely tell the story of the first novel Ian Fleming wrote about the famous spy, from directors Val Guest, Kenneth Hughes, John Huston, Joseph McGrath and Robert Parrish. Basically ageing spy Sir James Bond 007 (David Niven) is brought out of retirement after British Secret Service boss M (John Huston) has been killed, and he is going up against the enemy that is SMERSH. He comes up with the plan to trick the organisation and the villain of the piece, Le Chiffre (Orson Welles), all the top agents around the world, that is four, will have the name James Bond so that the real one cannot be found. So the agents following the clues to find out what the bad guys are up to are Evelyn Tremble (Peter Sellers), Cooper (Terence Cooper), female Vesper Lynd (Dr. No's Ursula Andress), female Mata Bond (Joanna Pettet) and female The Detainer (Daliah Lavi). The big test is to make sure the villain does not win a fortune at Casino Royale, as it could spell bad news for the world, so Evelyn makes sure to stop him. Many silly and sexy things are put in the way for the male spies to be distracted by, but everything falls into place as the bad guys may plan to make their move and take over the world. In the end, it turns out that the real villain of the film is in fact Sir James's own nephew, Jimmy (Woody Allen), he turned mean because he felt neglected, and the film ends in a laughable way as all the main characters die during an explosion at the casino, and go to Heaven, or Hell, all together. Also starring Deborah Kerr as Agent Mimi / Lady Fiona McTarry, William Holden as Ransome, Charles Boyer as Le Grand, John Huston as General McTarry, Kurt Kasznar as Smernov, Barbara Bouchet as Moneypenny, Jacqueline Bisset as Giovanna Goodthighs, Ronnie Corbett as Polo, Bernard Cribbins as Taxi Driver, Geoffrey Bayldon as Q, Anjelica Huston as Agent Mimi's Hands, Burt Kwouk as Chinese General, John Le Mesurier as M's Driver, Peter O'Toole as Scottish Piper and David Prowse as Frankenstein's Creature. The all star cast certainly keeps you interested, especially Sellers in the scenes with Andress, the use of colour and costume is fine as well, but this was a bit too kooky and strange for me most of the time, if you want a James Bond spoof it is much better to go with Austin Powers, but this one isn't a terrible spy spoof. Dusty Springfield's (written by Burt Bacharach) Oscar nominated ""The Look of Love"" and the title theme were number 21 on James Bond's Greatest Hits. It was nominated the BAFTA for Best British Costume. Okay!",Casino Royale
9,Tweekums,A frightfully dated James Bond Spoof,5,12 February 2021,"A sinister organisation, SMERSH, has been targeting the world's spies. This leads to Britain's greatest spy, Sir James Bond, coming out of retirement. As part of his plan to confuse the enemy he orders every agent, including the women, are to be referred to as James Bond 007! The operation progresses and one of these Bonds, Evelyn Tremble, faces SMERSH operative Le Chiffre in a game of baccarat in the titular Casino Royale. Ultimately the man behind SMERSH is exposed; which if any Bond will defeat him?I've been a fan of James Bond films since I first saw 'Dr No' on television as a child but somehow never got round to watching this '60s spoof. Given the cast I thought it was going to be rather fun... unfortunately it wasn't. There are some amusing moments but to be honest I think I laughed more at the wry humour of the official Bond films than at the silliness of this comedy. It is never subtle, always choosing silliness over wit. The numerous underdressed beautiful women may be easy on the eye but seem to be there to deflect from the films weaknesses. At over two hours in length it does drag a bit, several scenes could easily have been shortened or dropped altogether. I would be tempted to sum this up as 'Carry on James Bond' except for the fact that the Carry On team did that in 'Carry on Spying' three years previously... and their version was much funnier. Overall this certainly isn't a must see unless you have to see every Bond film.",Casino Royale
10,ma-cortes,A plotless spoof of James Bond movie with a mismatched cast of thousands and bizarre amusement,4,20 October 2021,"Run-of-the-mill Euro-spy rip-off movie with usual ingredients : wonderful girls with mini-skirts , pursuits , fights , fantastic gadgets , luxurious cars and a complete mess . Silly spoof , resulting to be the product of five filmmakers : Val Guest , Joseph McGrath , Robert Parrish , Ken Hughes and John Huston who played a brief role too and with a motley cast of dozens , as well as three credited writers : John Law , Mankowitz , Michael Sayers and uncredited : Billy Wilder , Ben Hecht , Joseph Heller, Terry Southern , Val Guest , Woody Allen and Peter Sellers himself . It deals with an elderly and retired James Bond : David Niven , who's assigned a new mission . As Bond comes of retirement and he proposes that the agents all around the world to be considered as agents James Bond . That's why you'll find that there are various James Bond and 007s in the movie including Peter Sellers , David Niven , Woody Allen, among others .This virtually failed film can stand as one of the low-water marks for 1960s comedy. It has lots of flaws and gaps , as it does tend to get a bit old , but it has big fun , so it cares . Adding a catching and agreeable musical leitmotif by composer Burt Bacharach . In spite of the strange combination of talents of this star-studded cast ensemble , the movie resulted to be a total flop , being the black sheep of the James Bond family of movies , though displays some diverting sketches . And yet there are some attractive bits within , scenes of bizarre hilarity . Suggested by the novel Casino Royale by Ian Fleming and really influenced by Sean Connery's James Bond series , Euro-spy movies and maybe ¨Get Smart¨ writer watched this film before making their series . It is a colorful lark , though very dated in its shiny Sixties pop-art way . Still , the all-star-cast is fun and standing out Woody Allen as Jimmy Bond and Barbara Bouchet as a gorgeous Moneypenny . As the main enjoyment is to guess who's the beautiful girl appearing here and there , including the following ones : Ursula Andress , Joanna Pettet , Dalilah Davi , Barbara Bouchet , Gabriella Licudi , Alexandra Bastedo , Tracy Reed , Mireille Darc , Veronica Carlson , Geraldine Chaplin , Caroline Munro and the veteran Deborah Kerr . While Orson Welles and Sellers literally coudn't stand the sight of one another and their scenes together were shot separately with stand-ins . And the rights to Casino Royale weren't part of the Ian Fleming package .It packs a colorful and shimmering cinematography by Jack Hildyard. The picture was lousily directed by Ken Hughes , John Huston , Joseph McGrath and Val Guest . Not wanting to compete with the Sean Connery vehicles , this movie was intented to be a stylish spoof but it was wrong . Rating : 4.5/10 . It is only sporadically funny . For the most , it's an overlong failure and overblown bore .",Casino Royale
11,moonspinner55,"It's a mad, mad, mad, mad world when 007s collide...",3,28 October 2007,"Elaborate, over-scaled, only fitfully entertaining spy-spoof helmed by five directors (Val Guest, Kenneth Hughes, John Huston, Joseph McGrath, Robert Parrish)--and probably a few uncredited others--who throw caution to the winds but only manage to get individual moments of the film to come to life. Retired agent James Bond returns to thwart SMERSH, only to find several other Bonds involved. Joanna Pettet is wonderfully mod as Mata Bond (this forgotten chick of the swinging '60s is truly hot stuff!), Deborah Kerr shines as Agent Mimi (it is perhaps her loosest performance), Ursula Andress trades sexy, funny heavy-lidded gazes with bespectacled Peter Sellers, and Woody Allen cuts up unashamedly. The fantastic score by Burt Bacharach, including the Oscar-nominated song ""The Look of Love"", is memorable, yet the slapstick movie is saddled with too much hectic business (and dullards like David Niven chewing up time on the clock). The screenplay doesn't give Ian Fleming's book the time of day, and it is ultimately too lengthy and hit-or-miss to hold interest for long. *1/2 from ****",Casino Royale
12,blanche-2,"an all-star, unholy mess missing only the kitchen sink",3,12 June 2005,"Long before Austin Powers, Charles Feldman, against his will, did a spoof of the James Bond movies with Casino Royale. I say against his will because he purchased the rights to the book Casino Royale and then found he could only use the name James Bond and the title - the plot had been used in other Bond films. So he decided to spoof the genre.He assembled a large cast of names and then I really don't know what he did. It was a very expensive looking film with some funny moments. None of it hung together, and apparently the 8 writers worked separately and then just handed in what they had. There were enough plots to make five more films. If I had to choose a plot, I think I would have chosen the one with Woody Allen as James Bond's nephew, who couldn't speak in his uncle's presence. The baccarat plot was a real mess, partially because Sellars and Welles refused to be on the same set. George Raft has a funny bit toward the end, if you last that long. I'm frankly amazed this got made.",Casino Royale
13,Quinoa1984,"it's madcap and all over the place in the worst ways, but its good nuggets are worth a watch- once",6,31 May 2007,"The original theatrical film of Ian Fleming's first James Bond novel, Casino Royale, was one of those genuine 1960s cluster-f*** productions of the 1960s, with too much money, too many actors on loan for two or three days without a script to really sink into, and a level of insanity-by-proxy as a comedy to really actually be what it wants to accomplish. In a way, one could even look at the first Austin Powers film, which features some of the same music as here, as the perfect critique and one-up of Casino Royale. But as it stands on its own, as a sort of tarnished relic of its time, it isn't a total throw-away. In fact, if you like crazy British comedies with Peter Sellers or David Niven (and who doesn't) it's certainly worth a look once, or at least an attempt to get through it all once. In a strange way, appreciation for the film for me was a little higher in thinking about a similar reaction I had to the third POTC movie, where the story, or rather convoluted to the Nth degree plots, make it a little too unbearable as it should be more grounded in its silliness instead of trying to make sense, which it doesn't invariably. But at the same time, there's a lot of fun scenes, and pure absurd shots of bliss from the actors, that brings out real laughs from the miasma.Trying to explain the plot is tricky, as I'm not sure the many, many writers, and directors (yes, directors, good luck if you try and figure out which scenes, aside from the ones he appeared in, were directed by John Huston), couldn't rightly explain it either in the twists it takes. The bare-bones I did decipher are as follows: Sir James Bond (David Niven, kind of nervy as a Bond at first, who then sort of settles into his one-note performance) is having many attempts on his life, and so decides that the course of action to take is to have all of the secret service agents out there go by the name James Bond! One of these is Evelyn Tremble (Sellers, not much, aside from one scene in a woman's room, into the multi-characters this time and is really quite straight-laced as a quasi-protagonist), who has to get into a high-stakes game of baccarat with the fiendish magician Le Chiffre (Orson Welles), while still evading possible murder from, well, someone I guess, primarily SMERSH, an evil faction out to destroy the Bonds and a lot of other things. Meanwhile, civilization seems to be collapsing, a spaceship comes into play, and Bond's nephew Jimmy (Woody Allen) has some dastardly plans of his own.That's the best I could figure on, anyway. A lot of what ensues at first seems to be a lot of innuendo with Niven and a floggle of eleven deadly daughters. Then it finally turns over to Sellers, who is good here though not really up to chops with his usual skills as a comic foil; it doesn't even seem like the script gives him enough to do, aside from the brief bit with the change of decorum (Sellers as Hitler, who knew?). Then there's a big entrance for Mata-Bond, through big corridors and an elaborate dance number. Then there's the expressionistic sets and camera angles for the scenes in the place where one of the main women, Mata-Bond I guess, stumbles around in trouble until a fellow agent comes in to help. A lot of this, in truth, is nonsense that isn't worth the effort simply because it isn't funny. A spark might happen once or twice, like a prop used to good effect (who knew a stuffed tighter with a lapping tongue could garner a laugh, or for that matter a cameo from Jean-Paul Belmondo), but it's really only for the good chunks that are worth the while. These chunks, primarily, are for the scenes with Woody Allen- his escape from a firing line, only to end up in another one, and his 'experiment' on a woman that goes terribly awry, leading him to taking steps to his demise- which are a total riot, and Orson Welles's scenes, where his hamming it up and magic tricks are just what the picture needs to get the lifeblood going (I liked a lot seeing Chiffre's mind-games on Sellers's Bond, as he gets stuck in a weird psychotropic twister, leading to one of the funniest cameos from any actor, Peter O'Toole in this case, in any comedy).But scenes like these, to put it bluntly, make not a good movie overall. There's so much madness in the production's history, which would have been fine if the filmmakers had come out with a coherent picture (as far as a James Bond spoof at the height of popularity could be). But it isn't, and it's reflected, in the size and scope, from the over-elaborate sets, plodding special effects, many many extras, and a huge climax that seems like the main inspiration for the climax for Blazing Saddles- and despite this film perhaps going even more for broke than Brooks did, on a higher budget Feldman's production doesn't use it to the more brazen effect. It's just chaos for the sake of it, with shrapnel's of brilliance flying out at the audience like some assistant to a gunner in a battle. Casino Royale is not a movie I could ever hate, but it's surely not one I would watch again, at least not from start to finish.",Casino Royale
14,JohnHowardReid,A fun film all the way!,9,8 October 2017,"Associate producer: John Dark. Producers: Charles K. Feldman, Jerry Bresler. Executive producer: Charles K.

New York opening at the Capitol and Cinemai: 28 April 1967. 11,804 feet. 131 minutes. (Available on a 10/10 M-G-M DVD).COMMENT: Highly enjoyable romp spoofing the James Bond saga. The film cost $12,000,000, most of which was undoubtedly spent on engaging such a wonderful line-up of players and building such stupendous sets. The art directors merit some prestigious Hollywood award for their superb creations. The directors are not saying who directed what, but it is obvious that Huston directed the opening sequence in which he appears and its delightful sequel in which Deborah Kerr gives her best performance for twenty years. Richard Talmadge directed the uproarious (if over-long) free-for-all at the climax. My favorite scene is the superb send-up of Bond's gadget-outfitting department which is twice as funny as the one in Last of the Secret Agents. But who directed this is anybody's guess. I was right there on the set, so I know Val Guest shot the scene in which Woody Allen is introduced before a firing squad and also the sequence in which Daliah Lavi is strapped to a table. I also know Joe McGrath handled the special effects scenes, including the one with Ursula Andress dressed in Highland costume. But I would really like to know who directed Joanna Pettet's scenes and inspired her to give such an inventive and spirited impersonation. Despite the film's length, there is scarcely one dull moment (perhaps just a few too many close-ups of Miss Andress). It's a fun film almost all the way.",Casino Royale
15,BandSAboutMovies,Spy junk,3,26 April 2020,"Forced out of retirement, the original James Bond (David Niven) battles Dr. Noah and SMERSH. Living up to the film's tagline ""Casino Royale is too much... for one James Bond!"", this movie ha six others pretending to be 007, including baccarat player Evelyn Tremble (Peter Sellers); millionaire spy Vesper Lynd (first Bond girl Ursula Andress), Bond's secretary Miss Moneypenny (giallo queen Barbara Bouchet), Bond's daughter with Mata Hari, Mata Bond (Joanna Pettet) and British agents Coop (Terence Cooper) and The Detainer (Daliah Lavi).If this sounds like a mess, so is the film, which has direction by Ken Hughes (Night School, Sextette), John Huston (The Treasure of the Sierra Madre), Joseph McGrath (The Magic Christian), Robert Parrish (The Fire Down Below), Val Guest (Where the Spies Are) and Richard Talmadge.Woody Allen, Peter Sellers, Val Guest, Ben Hecht, Joseph Heller, Terry Southern, and Billy Wilder all wrote parts of the movie, with Southern writing Sellers dialogue so he would look better than Allen and Orson Welles.Orson Welles finally appears in a Bond film as Le Chiffre, who is SMERSH's financial agent. He's been embezzling and hopes to gamble back his way into the money he needs to repay the evil spy organization. William Holden shows up as the CIA agent Ransome, George Raft plays himself (he's also playing Scarface, which is pretty much himself), Charles Boyer is Legrande, John Huston is M, Jacqueline Bisset is Miss Goodthighs, Pete O'Toole and so many more people show up.Speaking of Bisset, she was surprised when filming her first scene with Sellers, as he fired a gun directly in her face without warning. Though the gun was only loaded with blanks, her face was covered in burning gunpowder and her face started to bleed.""First I thought I had been actually shot and then when I realized it had been a blank, I thought I'd been blinded. My face looked like a shower spout of pinpricks leaking blood,"" said Bisset. ""I was panicked whenever I had a scene with Peter Sellers. To get shot in your first scene with a big star, that is a nightmare.""This is Anjelica Huston's first film role, as she was Deborah Kerr's hands. It's also the first movie for Dave Prowse as Frankenstein's Monster, a role he would play in The Horror of Frankenstein and Frankenstein and the Monster from Hell. He would go on to play, of course, Darth Vader.Casino Royale has so many actors who either appeared in a Bond movie or would go on to be in one: Ursula Andress (Dr. No), Vladek Sheybal (From Russia with Love), Burt Kwouk (Goldfinger, You Only Live Twice), Jeanne Roland (You Only Live Twice), Angela Scoular (On Her Majesty's Secret Service), Caroline Munro (The Spy Who Loved Me), Milton Reid (Dr. No, The Spy Who Loved Me), John Hollis (For Your Eyes Only), Jack Gwillim (Thunderball), John Wells (For Your Eyes Only) and Hal Galili (Goldfinger). Plus, Nikki Van der Zyl, who dubbed so many of the Bond Girls, does so here. She's uncredited, just as she was in the official films.There was plenty of drama on set between Sellers and Welles, as the British comedian really wanted to play Bond straight and hated the comedy angle. He was also upset that Princess Margaret paid more attention to Welles than himself when she visited the set.As a result, Sellers disappeared for days or weeks at a time, refused to appear in his scenes with Welles and left the movie before all of his scenes had been shot. The end of the movie had to be rewritten without him in it.To top off all of Sellers other behavior, he also punched out his friend, director Joseph McGrath, who told him to settle down.Burt Bacharach contributed the song ""The Look of Love,"" sung by Dusty Springfield, to this movie. If you ever wondered why Austin Powers loved Bacharach so much, there's your answer.This is the only movie where Bond dies. Let's hope no other film follows suit.",Casino Royale
16,Theo Robertson,Try And Remember It's A 60s Bond Spoof,6,4 September 2004,"It doesn't need pointing out by me but this Bond Spoof of CASINO ROYALE is a bit of a mess . It lacks shape , structure , focus and you find yourself frequently asking yourself at many points if the production team are making everything up as they're going along . If you can find a plot in here can you tell me what it is ? I mean top billed Peter Seller's character Evelyn Tremble is introduced plays "" James Bond "" for much of the movie then disappears from the narrative . None of this ties in with the ending in anyway . Would I be right in saying that Tremble is a most unnecessary addition to the story ? I was going to be cheeky and say that there's segments that feel they were written and directed by umpteen different people but as we all know this movie was written and directed by umpteen different people But I also have to defend CASINO ROYALE from rather too serious critics like Bob and co . Yes this Bond spoof is a very silly , self indulgent and daft mess with bits like Tremble getting into a racing car and the ending that don't even begin to make sense but there are also some fun moments like Jimmy Bond facing the firing squad and a few smart lines : "" Mummy would take me in - yes well mummy took everyone in "" Despite all the madcap moments at least the cast manage to keep their dignity which isn't always true of madcap comedies from the 1960s ( Check out Jack Lemmon in THE GREAT RACE to see what I mean ) and CASINO ROYALE has a good soundtrack . It should also be pointed out this movie was intended to be a Bond spoof , not something you can say about those Roger Moore films",Casino Royale
17,Scarecrow-88,Casino Royale:The spoof,5,12 May 2007,"I don't know what to think of this spoof. There were times where I cringed it was so awful while other times I couldn't help but giggle. Many of the stars appear quite inspired, and this cast is quite a vast array of talent..but they are often thrown in a film latent with on-going gags that work and don't work. David Niven is ideal for the role of elder statesman Bond, even if he is often stuck in some very unfunny situations. I loved Deborah Kerr as Lady Fiona McTarry, perhaps a secret agent who has a humorous bedroom scene with Niven's Bond. Woody Allen, in an early role, plays the wimpy nephew of Bond, jealous of his uncle's honoured name, turning to threaten global security thanks in part to the looming shadow. You have other stars such as Peter Sellers as a wannabe James Bond-type, Ursula Andress as a supposedly good agent, Orson Welles as the villainous Le Chiffre, even William Holden and John Huston himself make special cameos. The flick bleeds money on screen and it often seems like a child edited it. Many times, the film results to chaotic scenarios where Niven's Bond must survive certain peril. The ending is particularly insane with all hell breaking loose in the casino where Woody is hiccuping explosive pills of his own creation. It goes on and on, though..certainly long in the tooth.",Casino Royale
18,writers_reign,Rien Va Plus,3,8 February 2013,"For a film boasting six writers and ten directors this comes across as a film written by a thousand monkeys at nine hundred typewriters and directed by Alan Lake on peyote. It's the kind of movie you sit through merely to see how worse it can get whilst whispering silently 'come back, Ed Wood, all is forgiven. When Orson Welles' magic act is the best think by a country mile you know you're in trouble. Orson probably phoned it in and it's nice to think his cheque paid for a couple of reels of Don Quixtote. What William Holden and Charles Boyer are doing in the mix is anybody's guess and David Niven hasn't been so dire since Bonnie Prince Charlie and presumably felt like a proper Charlie though arguably not more so than Deborah Kerr, who was Scottish though you would never know it from her pathetic accent.

19,utgard14,What a Stinker,3,16 January 2014,"Overblown James Bond spoof is one of the worst major theatrical release films ever made. What a colossal waste of time and talent. The backstory and behind-the-scenes drama of the film is more interesting than the film itself. There isn't one funny moment in the entire mess. There's a pun early on where David Niven asks Deborah Kerr about her late husband's toupee and she refers to it as a ""hair-loom"" that I almost turned the movie off in disgust. But I knew it was one of the great train wrecks in movie history so I soldiered on. When it was all said and done the only positive I took away from Casino Royale was that it has quite a few lovely actresses. Kerr herself, 46 at the time, looks amazing for her age. Other than the eye candy, there's nothing to see here. The performances will give you second-hand embarrassment for all of the actors involved. Orson Welles was at a point in his career where he would do anything for a paycheck so I'm not really surprised about him or the likes of Ursula Andress. But Peter Sellers and David Niven? That's just sad, man. Multiple directors and multiple writers is almost always a sure sign of a terrible film. Avoid unless you're a Bond completist. In that case, prepare yourself for the worst.",Casino Royale
20,grantss,Was this ever funny?,3,4 September 2014,"Was this film ever funny? It's not funny in 2014 and I doubt it was funny when it was released in 1967. Ostensibly a spoof of the James Bond movies, it is incredibly silly and dull. It is so bad you would think that the producers deliberately made it a dud to prank the paying public.Worst thing is, it has an incredible cast: Orson Welles, Peter Sellers, David Niven, William Holden, Woody Allen, Ursula Andress, Deborah Kerr, John Huston, Jean-Paul Belmondo, George Raft, Jacqueline Bisset, Ronnie Corbett, Peter O'Toole (very briefly). I can understand David Niven acting in something dull - it's what he does - but I would have thought the great Orson Welles would have far more sense and taste than that.Given all this talent, there is only one scene and one performance that shines: Woody Allen in the underground lair scene. You can see his genius for physical comedy shine through. It was the only bright moment in a very dreary movie.Part of the problem might be the inordinate amount of writers and directors: 10 writers, 5 directors. You get the feeling that you are watching dozens of unrelated scenes and stories all stitched together without any real continuity. That's what 10 writers and 5 directors will do... (even when the directors include John Huston and the writers include Woody Allen, Billy Wilder, Joseph Heller and Peter Sellers).Avoid. You'll save two hours of your life...",Casino Royale
21,Boba_Fett1138,So many fine comedy talents involved but yet it isn't a very funny movie.,3,18 September 2008,"This is a rather messy movie, which also is no big surprise though considering the mess that was going on and off the set during the production of this movie. It took 6 directors and 10 different writers to complete the movie. On top of that the actors Peter Sellers and Oson Welles refused to work together, since they had a strong disliking against each other. A big problem, since there characters have to be in same sequences together.The movie is named ""Casino Royale"" but basically this movie and story have very little to do with the original Ian Fleming novel. it seems pretty pointless that they bought the right to the Ian Fleming novel. Or perhaps they simply had to do so in order to get to use all of the official names from the Bond-series, since all of the usual Bond characters, such as Bond, M, Q and Moneypenny are present here.Of course over the course of years there have been numerous movies spoofing the James Bond series but because this movie actually uses all of the official names this movie has a more 'official spoof' reputation and feeling over it. It doesn't make this movie better than other James Bond spoofs though.You should mainly blame the script for it that the movie doesn't work out. It's a movie with such an incredibly messy story. Halve of the time the movie just didn't made much sense to me. If of course also doesn't help that the movie it's main character in name is played by many different actors, with different styles, in this movie.It just isn't a very funny movie for a comedy. Basically only Peter Sellers and Woody Allen mange to put some fun into the film but their roles are rather limited compared to others. Also as a spoof of the James Bond-series this movie isn't exactly good or striking enough. Other movies have handled its James Bond spoofing elements far better.This movie can go down in history as the biggest waste of talents involved. Besides Peter Sellers and Woody Allen, the movie also features Orson Welles, David Niven, William Holden and John Huston among many other great and well known actors. The movie is also filled with cameos from some well known '60's figures and also actors.A messy, unfunny movie, that is one big waste of all of the talent involved.3/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",Casino Royale
22,oscaralbert,"As Sir Clarence Daly, author of BETWEEN A SAX AND A BASSOON: . . .",7,30 November 2014,". . . MY LIFE AS A BASS CLARINET, once observed, IF Monty Python had made a James Bond flick, it may well have looked a lot like CASINO ROYALE (1967). How else to describe a cinematic climax in which a call goes out for the cavalry, and within moments a troop rides off a big screen into a gambling hall? Or a close in which a tribe of Apache exits a transport plane midair shouting ""Geronimo,"" and are soon seen firing AK-47 assault arrows in the same venue? Or a story NOT entitled HAMLET, in which everyone dies at the end? Famously remade by Michael Myers (as his AUSTIN POWERS series), this original film version of CASINO ROYALE generally sticks closer to Ian Fleming's Agent 007 debut novel from 1953 than the ball-busting 2006 Daniel Craig farce. True, both treatments retain the characters of ""Vesper"" and ""Le Chiffre,"" (a not-so-fat Orson Welles here), but Craig's remake presents itself way too seriously to take a stab at the ""Dr. Noah"" role (which Woody Allen created for the 1967 version). Instead, makers of the 2006 flick try to top Dr. Noah with a ""free runner"" in its ""Mollaka"" character. Mollaka is supposed to be some sort of Cartoonish Roadrunner, who runs up and down construction cranes. Only Agent 007 is capable of out-distancing Mollaka (as if Bond is a Wile E. Coyote capable of WINNING!). By the way, the last time Shirley MacLaine channeled Bond novelist Ian Fleming, he said that--when all was said and done--he really preferred David Niven as James Bond.",Casino Royale

Aided and abetted by How On Earth Did This Get Made? The Bond series had taken off, and you own the rights to one of the books, so what do you do? Do you make an adaptation of it, with someone else cast as James Bond? Well, yes and no...While more of Fleming's original story remained here than was often the case in the official series, the ""adaptation"" means that, despite having multiple James Bonds on hand, this is a Bond movie only in the very loosest sense. It is in fact, a complete shambles.And yet it is a good natured shambles with a sense of fun, an ability to entertain despite its incoherence, Joanna Pettett and Dahlia Lavi, a cast which is (to say the least) eclectic, and some terrific music from Burt Bacharach.I think I would count it as one of my guilty pleasures.",Casino Royale
24,HotToastyRag,David Niven gets his revenge by spoofing 007,1,16 November 2018,"My dear, dear, darling Niv. I can only hope he had a wonderful time filming and letting his hair down with his frequent costar Deborah Kerr, and that he got a very nice salary, and that audiences in 1967 enjoyed this madcap comedy. It certainly doesn't stand the test of time.David Niven, Ian Fleming's original choice to play James Bond, had to suffer the terribly insulting Hollywood insult of being called too old and replaced by a younger actor, finally got his revenge by starring as the famous spy in a spoof of the early Bond films. I'd describe the plot, but there doesn't seem to be a cohesive storyline. Just when you think you know what's going on, it feels like there's a shift and everything starts from scratch. Then, you remind yourself that the opening credits displayed four different directors, so it makes sense that the movie doesn't have one complete vision. For example, the beginning plot is a plot by James Bond's enemies to tarnish his reputation by sending beautiful female agents to seduce him. Then, when that doesn't work, Joanna Pettet is randomly introduced as his daughter and goes on her own spy mission in Berlin. Then, Peter Sellers is recruited in the agency, and he gets bombarded by Ursula Andress and Jacqueline Bisset while he tries to prepare for a card game with Orson Welles. Meanwhile, I'm left groaning in front of the tv with the fast-forward button at the ready, wondering when David Niven will come back on the screen.Hopefully 1967 audiences were rolling in the aisles at the screwball action scenes, ridiculous Burt Bacharach music, and spoofs of the ""typical bad guys"" in spy movies. Modern audiences will mostly laugh at the similarities between this film and the Austen Powers franchise, including the x-ray glasses that can see the cards at the gambling table, robotic women with machine guns, and bagpipes that release sleeping gas.The first vignette-the important one, with David Niven, Deborah Kerr, and cameos by William Holden, John Huston, Charles Boyer, and Kurt Kasznar-is enjoyable and funny, because it doesn't include any of the silly 1960s antics. Sure, there are some sex jokes that every '60s flick snuck in to celebrate the demise of the Hays Code, but they are pretty funny. Since The Niv was a renowned playboy, it's funny to see him resisting the female agents who try to seduce him: one girl undresses him and spends an inordinate amount of time undoing his boxers, another hops in the bathtub with him and scrubs his back, and Deborah Kerr even starts a striptease!The rest of the over-two-hour-long movie is terrible. It's so awful, it will make you never want to watch another 1960s movie again. If you love James Bond spoofs, just stick with Austen Powers, and if you love Peter Sellers, stick with The Pink Panther, and if you love David Niven, check out the hilarious comedy he made the following year instead: The Impossible Years.DLM Warning: If you suffer from vertigo or dizzy spells, like my mom does, this movie is not your friend. It will make you sick. There are several sequences that will make you sick with various tactics, including strobe lights, tilted camera angles, whirpool set designs, and spinning shots. In other words, ""Don't Look, Mom!""",Casino Royale

Peter Sellers plays a younger ""James Bond"" agent while Woody Allen is on hand as a diminutive ""James Bond."" Orson Welles plays the lead heavy while William Holden and John Huston have small roles.""Casino Royale"" (1967) is notorious in cinema and generally loathed by critics & cinephiles, but it's actually superior to contemporaneous spy satires like ""In Like Flint"" (1967) and ""Fathom"" (1967).It was intentionally made with four different directors in mind for four separate segments, but ended up with six directors. There were originally 4 writers (if you include Ian Fleming's book), but ended up with a total of 11. Welles and Sellers didn't get along and refused to work together. It was one of the most expensive films of its day and cost more than any of the James Bond flicks up to that time.Surprisingly, it all sort of comes together for a madly amusing 60's secret agent farce despite the problematic Sellers being fired before all of his scenes were shot. I suggest using the subtitles so you can make out all the witty verbiage and follow what's happening.The female cast is outstanding with Barbara Bouchet (Moneypenny) and Joanna Pettet (Mata Bond) leading the way, but also featuring Ursula Andress (Vesper Lynd), Jacqueline Bisset (Miss Goodthighs), Deborah Kerr (Lady Fiona) and several others, including Caroline Munro and Veronica Carlson in cameos.The movie is overlong at 2 hours, 11 minutes.

The film took millions and months to make with five directors included the original director Joseph McGrath who was fired along the shoot. Val Guest was segment director. The film is a compilation of five different directors taken aim at James Bond in a farcical humor and satire. Peter Sellers was a difficult during the filming but he comes across brilliantly on screen. Woody Allen is hysterical in a rare performance where he didn't write or direct himself. David Niven was brilliantly entertaining. Orson Welles is always fabulous. The film is a psychedelic adventure and romp in the 1960s in London, England and elsewhere.

""Casino Royale"" is set to parody the James Bond series of movies, and the secret intelligence efforts of the major world powers of the mid-20th century. So, the audience knows what the theme of its plot is about. Yet it falls far short of being able to do that. Its humor isn't dead pan as much as it is just plain dead. It has many clichés – obviously intentional – but they fail to elicit laughter. The plot is all over the place and lacks coherence. As it plays out, one gets the impression that some key scenes or connecting parts between scenes were left on the cutting room floor in the final editing. The idea surely had merit and could have been a big success. But it needed a first-rate script and direction to get the humor out of the actors. Unfortunately, it just doesn't succeed. About the only thing going for this film is its sizable cast of well known actors of the day. And it is a huge cast.

31,ShadeGrenade,"""They Used To Say A Good Spy Was A Pure Spy!""",8,14 September 2006,"'Casino Royale' holds the distinction of being the very first James Bond film ever to play on British television. It went out on Boxing Day 1973, and I can remember being thoroughly confused by the thing. The plot kept jumping about from one place to another, a female character ( 'Lady Fiona' ) who started out Scottish suddenly became French, and David Niven's Sir James Bond seemed to bear little resemblance to the dashing super-spy I read about in newspapers and magazines.Of course it later became clear that this was no bona fide 007 epic, but an all-star comedy spectacular along the lines of 'Those Magnificent Men In Their Flying Machines'. Two years later, I.T.V. screened 'Dr.No' - the first real Bond movie.'Casino Royale' begins with the heads of the world's intelligence services asking Sir James Bond to come out of retirement to help deal with SMERSH. He refuses, so they rather ungallantly blow up his house. M ( John Huston ) is killed, and Bond drives to Scotland to hand over his final remains ( a toupee in a box ) to his widow. What he does not know is that Lady Fiona has been replaced by Agent Mimi ( Deborah Kerr ). The girls posing as her daughters are SMERSH agents too. Their job is to wreck Bond's celibate ( ! ) image.The plan fails and Bond returns to London, where he orders all existing agents to pose under his name to confuse the enemy. He then recruits Vesper Lynd ( Ursula Andress ) and gives her the job of getting the compulsive gambler Evelyn Tremble ( Peter Sellers ) to beat SMERSH agent Le Chiffre ( Orson Welles ) at baccarat...When reviewing this, many fall into the trap of comparing it to the Eon Bond films. Though based on Ian Fleming's first Bond book, it has little in common. Terry Southern was one of the many uncredited writers. Five directors were involved, the first being Joe McGrath, later to direct the cult classic 'The Magic Christian' ( 1970 ), based on Southern's novel.Taken on its own terms, it is a lot of mad fun ( almost Pythonesque in fact ), and boasts stupendous art direction, photography ( by Jack Hildyard and Nicolas Roeg ) and special effects. Some scenes, like Mata Bond's excursion to Berlin, do not work, while others such as Evelyn Tremble's baccarat duel with LeChiffre, are ridiculously enjoyable. Welles would have made a great villain in a real Bond flick.David Niven is delightful as the retired master spy Sir James Bond, one wishes he had been in more scenes. Unlike Sean Connery's version, this one stammers, has an artificial kneecap, and hates women. Peter Sellers and Woody Allen are also on good form.The main problem is the fragmented plot, and the endless procession of irrelevant guest stars. Less would definitely have been more. Burt Bacharach's song 'The Look Of Love' wouldn't have disgraced an Eon Bond movie.'Casino Royale' needs to be seen as a product of its era, when Bondmania ruled the world. A film of this calibre could not be made now. Despite being overlong and self-indulgent, it still contrives to be great fun.",Casino Royale
32,Red-Barracuda,"One part senseless, one part annoying, one part seductive",7,24 July 2015,"In order to be able to enjoy Casino Royale on any level you need to be willing to overlook a lot of problems. It had five directors who were originally meant to oversee their own mini-segments which would then go on to make up an anthology movie but in the end all of their work was stitched together as a single piece. Not only this but the actor originally pencilled in to play the James Bond role, Peter Sellers, left the production before the end leaving his filmed parts incomplete and resulting in re-writes to the plot leading to David Niven being wheeled in to play a retired Bond as well as other actors playing Bond clones. Confused? You certainly should be! The factors mentioned above went some considerable way to make Casino Royale such a monumentally incoherent and unstructured film. I lost the plot, so to speak, several times during this. Characters come and go, plot threads go nowhere or abruptly end and lots of things justhappen. All of this results in a plot-line that never bothers to take itself seriously, so why the hell should we? Indeed, the very the fact it's such an obvious shambles is part of what makes it so interesting to look back on.The best way to approach this movie is to just take each scene individually and not spend too much effort piecing them together logically. The phrase the individual parts work better than the whole seems to have been coined with this film in mind. There's no question that its ludicrously overlong for what it is and it's undeniable that it's very bloated and self-indulgent. It wouldn't be unfair either to say that it really only has a few good ideas sprinkled throughout its epic run-time. Yet, for all that, it is deliciously of-it's-time and a true one-off. It was an unofficial Bond film because of an ownership issue that meant that the novel 'Casino Royale' could not be used by the official Bond franchise Eon before the end of the century. Consequently, it was made by an entirely different production company and, for some reason they decided that the best approach would be to make it a spy-spoof that parodied the Bond films.It is notable for its enormous ensemble cast, most of whom must have wondered just what in hell they were doing. David Niven plays Bond as a gentleman spy who is diametrically opposite in style and approach to any other cinematic depiction of the famous secret agent. Orson Welles appears as the master criminal and he and Sellers took an instant dislike to one and other resulting in huge tensions on set. A youthful Woody Allen appears as Bond's nephew and was responsible for all of the laugh-out-loud moments for me. The great actress Deborah Kerr also appears as M's wife in a strange extended sequence set in Scotland. But maybe best of all is the conveyor-belt of gorgeous ladies who were Euro sex symbols of the time – we have Ursula Andress as a secret agent (looking better here than ever before), Joanna Pettet plays Mata Hari's daughter in an extended unrelated segment and a young Barbara Bouchet appears as Miss Moneypenny's daughter. The lush lounge soundtrack by Burt Bacharach is rightfully famous too, including 'The Look of Love' with vocals by Dusty Springfield. And despite its utter senselessness, it is an undeniably gorgeous looking film with great art design and a brilliant cinematographer in Nic Roeg. Its colourful, psychedelic pop art aesthetic never really gets old. It's pretty easy to see where Mike Myers got most of his ideas for his 'Austin Powers' franchise. Casino Royale is certainly an acquired taste overall but if you can get beyond its incomprehensibility you could have a good enough time with its glorious 60's vibes.",Casino Royale

His role is rather brief, but it contains some of his funniest lines (""My doctor said I cannot have bullets enter my body at any time!"") and physical comedy EVER!2) The production is lavish, full of bright colors and large-scale sets.3) The women look fantastic, especially Ursula Andress (my God!), Barbara Bouchet and Joanna Pettet.4) Burt Bacharach's music and songs are very catchy.There are also some bizarre moments that are neither good nor bad...just interesting (like the appearance of the UFO).BUT...the script is disjointed, the direction has no sense of comic rhythm and, worst of all, most of the comedy is PAINFULLY unfunny.I think it all comes down to this: ""Casino Royale"" is too pleased with itself. The filmmakers seem to be thinking ""we have stars, we have cameos, we have money to burn, what could go wrong?"". Well, money can buy you a lot of things, but comic talent is not one of them. Out of all the people who worked on this film, only two could do comedy: Woody Allen and Peter Sellers.

It's mostly really rushed at the end and it isn't spread out well enough for all of these jokes. Interestingly enough, this may have set forth the idea that James Bond was a code name as it is here. A pity such a popular theory had to come from such a subpar movie. I will defend it a little on the grounds that it was the first of its kind and they didn't know what to work with.

In my young mind, they were daring, stylish and full of sexual innuendo. The early Bond films-""Dr. No"", ""From Russia with Love"", ""Goldfinger"", and ""Thunderball""-lived up my expectations and surpassed them, with Sean Connery playing for life-and-death stakes against SPECTRE, a villainous international crime syndicate dedicated, it seemed, to eradicating Bond.Then, in 1967, ""Casino Royale"" was released. It was not a part of the Broccoli/Saltzman franchise and, in fact, was a spoof designed to capitalize on its success.A British production, it is filled with slapstick, bad puns, and general tomfoolery. Because of its numerous writers, it has a disjointed comic style. Because it was filmed in the sixties, it displays elements of the mod style.The narrative is about Sir James Bond (David Niven) coming out of retirement to deal with SMERSH, a villainous international crime syndicate dedicated to hiring cheesy henchmen and led by a shadowy figure who surrounds himself with beautiful women. But in this film, everyone is surrounded by beautiful women.The story includes various characters recruited to become ""the new James Bond"" and to handle certain portions of the overall mission, which is as disjointed as the entire film. The cast is rife with cameos and bit parts by cinema legends (e.g. Orson Welles, Peter O'Toole, and William Holden). The most notable performances are by Deborah Kerr, who sports a thick Scottish accent, Ursula Andress as the prototypical exotic beauty of the day, and Woody Allen as the neurotic, nebbish nephew of Sir JamesThe best part of the film is its music, featuring Bacharach & David, Dusty Springfield, and Herb Alpert and the Tijuana Brass. The musical style is sophisticated, smooth, and sexy.The big scene is a frenetic free-for-all featuring cowboys and Indians, a chimp, and bubbles. This madcap mess contributes nothing to the story and is included merely for spectacle. It most resembles the silliness of Benny Hill.It is best to watch this film for its musical segments and the numerous appearances by film stars. This is a frippery that does not add to the canon of James Bond, but exists in its own universe as a mindless diversion.",Casino Royale

This is not a real James Bond movie. It is a movie featuring James Bond as the led character. And all the James Bond movie made before it count. All the ones made after do not match up to what happens in this movie. It's like in the later ones this one never happened. It is not a real James Bond movie it is a satire of the 007 films. It is meant to be funny and it is not it's Just stinky pooh. Woody Allen is an awful Bond villain. David N.i.v.e.n gives his best effort as James Bond but even Sean Connery and Roger Moore could do anything for this awful script. If you want to see good movie about James Bond see the one before it Thunder ball. Or the one after it You only live twice. Or Casino r.o.y.a.l.e with Daniel Craig. Which is nothing like this movie except that James Bond and a Casino are in it. All the James Bond movies are good except this one. It is pooh. This not James Bond. It is James Pooh pooh. That is what they should have called David N.i.v.e.n's character because this is not James Bond.,Casino Royale

There is so much going on (often too much)and so very much talent involved that it could possibly be 2 or 3 movies.THE NOVELTY OF having multiple Bonds, all with slightly different takes on just what it is to be the super spy of super spies. The loosely connected subplots create a sort of bogus unity of storyline, sort of. In reality, the screenplays could well be exhibited in a much more effective manner if they were done as an anthology movie; such as TRILOGY OF TERROR, TALES OF MANHATTAN and THE YELLOW ROLLS ROYCE.OTHER THAN THE lovely ladies who star in this hodge-podge of a story, perhaps the most memorable element of this Summer Super Spectacular Picture is the Soundtrack. The incidental music is typical of the melodic and high energy product of the team of Bert Bacharach and Hal David. Nothing is more powerful and continually being played than the featured love song, The Look of Love.THE PRODUCTION FOLLOWED by approximately a year the coming of the ""Camp"" craze; which of course was a result of the success of the BATMAN TV Series (Greenway Prod./20th Century-Fox/ABC TV, 1966-68).* After that success, no one wanted to take anything seriously.ADDED TO THE above mentioned elements, we add the influence of ""the British Invasion"" of the United States' Pop Music scene. The music and the addition of Carnaby Street fashion, a seemingly unlimited budget and an International Cast with some Worldwide filming all added up to what we can call CASINO ROYALE a most memorable Summer Blockbuster; albeit one with plenty of overkill in most areas.** NOTE: * We've always argued that the BATMAN Series wasn't truly ""Camp""; as real ""Camp"" is unintentionally funny, i.e., REEFER MADNESS or the original BATMAN Serial (Columbia, 1943).NOTE: ** The title of CASINO ROYALE has been use 3 times. In addition to this 1967 spoof, we had the 2006 Bond film with Daniel Craig and as a weekly installment episode of the live TV anthology, CLIMAX! on CBS Television Network, we had an adaption of CASINO ROYALE starring popular actor Barry Nelson as James Bond of the CIA!",Casino Royale

48,myriamlenys,as bloated and as ripe as a decomposing whale,2,23 July 2017,"There are many things wrong with this movie. The main one is the fact that the movie was made at all. Somewhere in the middle of the 1960's a number of directors and producers should have invited the various artists and collaborators to a meeting. Then they should have addressed their audience as follows : ""Good people, we're giving up on the project. We've tried everything and anything : a plan A, a plan B, a plan C and even a plan D. However, nothing seems to work. So we're stopping activities as of today. Please be so kind as to go home. Mrs. Murchison from Accounting will pay you your fee, together with a hefty compensation for wasting your time and jeopardizing your fine reputation"".Tragically, none of this happened and the result is the long, bloated, incoherent and pretentious mess known as ""Casino Royale"".It's deeply galling that the movie assembles so much talent and then goes on to spoil it with all the reckless abandon of a three-year old. Have you ever met one of those awful people who will elbow their way to the buffet, load their plates with the finest delicacies (salmon, truffles, crab meat, anything rare and expensive) and mix their food into a weird-looking heap ? And then they'll eat just a tiny, tiny spoonful ? Well, translate the process to the movie industry and you'll end up with this ""Casino"".Still, I've got to admit that the music is nice. And the line about Mata Hari's bed - ""the German army was very large in these days"" - can still make me laugh like a maniac.",Casino Royale
49,slokes,Why Acid And Espionage Don't Mix,3,27 January 2007,"""Casino Royale"" reminds me of an exchange in a later psychedelic movie, when Marlon Brando shows Martin Sheen around an operation he commands and asks what Sheen thinks of his methods.""I don't see any method at all,"" Sheen replies.That's ""Casino Royale"" in a nutshell to me, an attempt to parody the James Bond craze from the first half of the 1960s by grafting it onto the counterculture boom of the latter half. Directed by five different directors, its two major stars (David Niven and Peter Sellers) never sharing a scene, the film shows zero coherence in design or execution. What passes for humor are mostly ""no soap radio"" non-sequiturs and in-jokes delivered in a broad and painful manner.Niven is Sir James Bond, a retired gentleman-spy with nothing but contempt for the sex-and-gadgetry approach of late. When spies start dropping like flies, targets of a secret organization, East and West come together to coax Sir James back into the game.I enjoy watching ""Casino Royale"" for its lost-in-time ambiance, and for little things like the boxy cut of Barbara Bouchet's eyelashes and the creaking percussion of Dusty Springfield's centerpiece song, ""The Look Of Love."" But all this points up how cinema works best as communal and not individual entertainment. I would never dare inflict ""Casino Royale"" on friends, thinking they will be as entertained by the little things. People who say ""Casino Royale"" is good because of the pretty ladies and sets or for its Burt Bacharach score miss the point that no one can possibly be distracted from such quality elements by the story or acting.Though a commercial success, and today a cult classic for many, ""Casino Royale"" is widely and properly regarded as an expensive embarrassment. Much of the blame is laid on Sellers, who left the set in mid-shoot and apparently never returned. On screen, he never looked better than he does here, yet he registers zero comic presence, preening and looking lost under a variety of accents and disguises. His character, a baccarat expert named Evelyn Tremble, shows up about 45 minutes into the movie and disappears an hour later, interacting with hardly anyone else in the cast except Ursula Andress, here at her gorgeous peak. Watching her seduce him under the gaze of Admiral Nelson and assorted aquarium fishes is the film's style apex.There are other like moments, like one set in a Taj Mahal-type palace where Joanna Pettet and her court perform a dance for Niven to a piece of Bacharach music. It's a great set, and great music, but the elements never come together, so the scene drags.Occasionally there are laughs, as when Daliah Lavi introduces herself: ""I'm the new secret weapon, and I've just been perfected."" Woody Allen gets off some good lines, too, but he's hardly in the film. Niven struggles gamely with material that must have had the old boy raising an eyebrow or two, but he drowns under a storyline that requires he dub everyone ""James Bond 007"" and affect a stammer he suddenly drops for no reason at all.There is no reason for much of anything in ""Royale,"" except to capture an era when people thought they were discovering the meaning of life in various psychotropic substances. Worth seeing if you are interested in cinematic bellwethers, even those that led to dead-ends.",Casino Royale
50,I_Ailurophile,"An astounding, perplexing jumble",5,12 November 2021,"Nothing in the history of Eon Productions' James Bond serires, nor possibly any spy flick, can prepare you for the cinematic chaos that 'Casino Royale' represents. What order there is to this film is sparing, and quite literally forced. While stylized opening credits immediately inform of the less than serious tone the movie takes, and the first scene or so lays a concrete groundwork for the plot, everything beyond that becomes an astonishing representation of disarray in film-making and storytelling. This isn't to say that the picture is outright bad, but it's a curiosity of the utmost befuddlement, and I'm not 100% sure how to feel about it.Early dialogue pointedly pokes fun at the excesses of Eon's 007 films - namely the gadgets, and women, and Bond's rakish behavior - before the feature then somewhat indulges in them itself, if in a manner not quite as ham-fisted. It's also very much worth noting the extraordinary cast haphazardly cobbled together here. Of course there are the major stars: David Niven, Peter Sellers, Ursula Andress, Orson Welles, Deborah Kerr, John Huston, and so on. But the enormous supporting cast is rounded out with names and faces that have appeared in no few of the Eon flicks, or elsewhere in familiar pictures, or who in some instances make their first appearance anywhere. Anjelica Huston, Peter O'Toole, Caroline Munro, Burt Kwouk, John Hollis, Vladek Sheybal, and more all show up at one time or another. It's kind of remarkable, really.There's some true cleverness in the screenplay, whether jokes, sight gags, or story beats. The overall concept is solid, and there are a few really good ideas. Some sequences were done very well, such as the introduction of Mata Bond. We're also treated to great set design, and costume design. However, most all such value is generally overwhelmed by the messiness the movie represents, and where that value manifests, it's often quickly replaced by overblown ridiculousness.'Casino Royale' is extremely over the top. It's so over the top as to careen past comedy, into the territory of pure bizarrerie. One can't say that Michael Myers' ""Austin Powers"" films were entirely spoofs - they lifted some scenes almost directly from this. It's so indulgently over the top that words like ""parody"" and ""satire"" no longer apply, and the feature just becomes a kaleidoscopic, kludgy assemblage of all possible ideas, no matter how outlandish - accordingly including even outtakes, and references to other scenes that were ultimately cut.The narrative is confused, disjointed, bloated, and self-indulgent. The plot is developed with so little clarity as to sometimes be altogether obfuscated. A lot of the runtime is spent expanding the story outward, but not progressing forward. As it does advance, once again: There are some sound notions here. Yet 'Casino Royale' also plays very fast and loose with the bounds of its own universe. It goes so over the top as to exceed the most unsightly Eon pictures or even Austin Powers in complete ludicrousness. As the climax rolls around, we're subjected to the most terrible excesses of 1960s TV and film. The scene in its entirety is some of the most unwieldy, tacky, nonsensical tomfoolery ever committed to film, and the ending we get is downright outrageous.Here's the thing, though: 'Casino Royale' also has a fabulously complicated and preposterous production history, with multiple writers and directors attached at varying points. To read of the background of the movie at least tenders an explanation for the absolute mess that it became. Pecularities including (and certainly not limited to) the poor working relationship between Welles and Sellers, Welles' demands, and Sellers' sudden departure help the viewer to understand why some figures in the plot have particular traits, or how others (one in particular) have an unbelievably far-fetched character arc. It seems as though the minimal sense of mindful composition and sequencing that 'Casino Royale' boasts can be attributed to the efforts of John Huston to salvage the hours of footage that had already been captured. With all this said - if nothing else, the severity of the deep inelegance at literally every level offers awe-inspiring, incredulous laughter of disbelief. Still, the picture itself is - far, far more than not - simply a nightmare of breathtaking proportions, and beyond all possible expectations.Have no doubt, there are many worse movies you could watch. Why, for all the gracelessness on hand, this cinematic smorgasbord nonetheless manages to genuinely best some of Eon's storied Bond franchise. That modest pedestal comes with a caveat, though - not a footnote, but a lengthy appendix. There's some quality storytelling of its own merit, yet what fun one can extract from this odd marvel largely follows from our profound bewilderment. And regardless, the viewing experience is rather plainly a bit of a labor, straining our suspension of disbelief to the breaking point. I won't say that I specifically recommend against it, but 1967's 'Casino Royale' is a feature for only the most open-minded and adventurous of moviegoers. Feel free to watch if you like - just don't say I didn't warn you.",Casino Royale

It's supposed to be a James Bond parody but there isn't a single moment that is funny.
I hated the music . You wouldn't expect such a horrible sound to come from someone like Burt Bacharach but he managed to make the soundtrack sound like cross between a Porno and a Carry on .
The entire movie feels like a bad trip . I've never done LSD but I now know what it must feel like .Peter Sellers was notoriously difficult to work with on set . He fell out with Orson Welles and famously shot Jacqueline Bisset in the face with a gun that had blanks in and injured her .

It's the movie equivalent of someone elbowing you in the ribs for two hours. Almost no one has any sense of timing. The pacing is belabored and there's barely a setup that results in a laugh. I usually enjoy puerile British 60s comedies. I don't enjoy the Bond movies so I'm the ideal audience for a send-up. Sadly, David Niven is unfunny & uninteresting, and Deborah Kerr can't ""do comedy"", although she's given a startling classic line to deliver, ""...then the girls were raped, eldest first according to scripture!""The first portion that works (kind of) is when Ursula Andress has Peter Sellers over. Her big segment benefits from her professionalism and ability to put some polish on a piece of crap. She's beautiful and assured here. By the time some vivid, druggy Cinemascope things start happening, I had way lost interest. And that was after making it through the prolonged, stillborn setup, and with plenty of fast-forwarding through the prolonged Scotland sequence. Save yourself some pain and skip to chapter ten for ""the Look of Love"" sequence, then jump to the Berlin sequence at about one hour ten minutes. Check the assured comic delivery, expressionist sets and the deep focus at the Mata Hari school. The rest is hit or miss; a laugh here, a funny line or a cool set there. The misses are particularly grating. Mata Bond should have been strangled for the audiences relief. Even a cameo from Peter O'Toole, who's given some dead material to recite can't help. Sellers wisely fled this production. The Burt Bachrach soundtrack is inept; to complement comedy sequences he provides a ""zany"" score. This movie actually has cutaways to ""funny"" actors crossing their eyes. Worst of all the movie is over two hours long. As you near the corny climax, you wonder why they treat every single frame of this train wreck like it's indispensable. There might actually be a funny 80 minute movie inside this mess. It is impossible to guess how much many hits of acis were deployed writing this script. Many, many bits were lifted by Austin Powers.

It started funny enough - at Sir James Bond's (David Niven) home where he was approached by four international agents that forced him to come out of retirement and head up the operation against the evil organization SMERSH. His mission is to destroy Topple LeChiffre (Orson Welles} at the baccarat tables where he never loses and wins a lot of money to supply SMERSH. Then, the movie becomes silly, stupid, pointless, and (what is the worst) not funny. Only Woody Allen, (as Bond's incompetent nephew, Jimmy Bond) brilliant as usual has appeared in two scenes and made them silly and hilarious. I think that ""Casino Royale"" (the way it was made) illustrates the fact that bigger is not always better - overlong and overblown, written and directed by five or more writers and directors, it brings to mind an old saying, ""Too many cooks spoil the broth"".OT: the abbreviation SMERSH really existed during the WWII.

56,Chase_Witherspoon,Vodka martinis and LSD inspired Bond parody,6,21 May 2011,"Before Daniel Craig paraded his abs in digital widescreen, Peter Sellers was cross-dressing with Ursula Andress on a revolving bed in this mad-cap satire of the James Bond franchise. Here, Bond (impersonated by a number of actors, principally Sellers as an ordinarily introverted baccarat expert) tries to outwit master criminal Le Chiffre (Welles) in the title casino while the patron of the Bond dynasty, Sir James Bond (Niven) must stop the diabolical plans of a clumsy would-be villain (and another Bond alias), Woody Allen.The film is an at times non-sensical tapestry of apparently LSD inspired design, underscored by a brassy Herb Alpert score and racy actresses of the era (Daliah Lavi and Joanna Pettet in addition to Andress). The cast is surprisingly diverse for such a send-up with William Holden, Charles Boyer and Deborah Kerr playing rare comedic roles (Kerr particularly camp as the dotty widow of McTarry, the equivalent of ""M"", played by John Huston). Blink and you'll miss Peter O'Toole in a pointless cameo as a bag-piper.Countless funnies include my personal favourite when Sellers' Bond gets fitted out by Q-branch (Bayldon & Wells) with a smart looking Rolex wristwatch that in addition to other more spy-related purposes, can tell the shape of the moon. Obviously, if you prefer your Bond straight-up with just the usual twist of wit, then you're unlikely to find this piece of late-sixties sub-culture your cup of tea.

There's really not all that much to say about it besides the surprising cast, including Woody Allen, David Niven and Orson Welles (Citizen Kane!?). The script is filled with so-so slap-stick comedy that doesn't live up to any other British comedy film like the Monty Python films; Casino Royale exists because it was a 60s cash-grab to capitalize on the decade's spy-movie craze.

58,BrandtSponseller,An experiment that didn't quite work,5,1 June 2005,"Casino Royale has some outstanding elements. The production design is worth a 10. There are beautiful, often provocatively dressed or relatively undressed women everywhere you look. Many of its segments are funny; it's even occasionally hilarious.The problem arose in putting all of it together. And with at least five directors and at least ten writers, it's not difficult to see why. The whole is a mess. There is little in the way of overarching plot. Most threads are just completely abandoned after awhile.The story, which is very loosely based on Ian Fleming's James Bond novel Casino Royale (published in 1953--it's the first Bond novel), is a spoof of the typical adventure featuring the infamous secret agent. The real Bond (David Niven) went into retirement when his skills were at their peak. This Bond is quite different than the Bond we know--he is almost chaste, he's a homebody, he dedicates each evening's twilight to playing Debussy on the piano, and so on. Casino Royale has it that the Bond we know from other films is a decoy.A group of older men, representing the secret agencies of the US, the UK, Russia and France, are on their way to the real Bond's home to ask for his assistance. It seems that someone has been trying to wipe out as many secret agents as they can. While they're pitching the idea of coming out of retirement to Bond, they're attacked. Bond's house is blown up, and he (implicitly) agrees to the assignment. Casino Royale is the story of the real Bond trying to get to the bottom of the sinister agent-wipeout plan. Part of carrying that out involves changing the identity of nearly every spy to James Bond--if the real Bond is to work unimpeded, he can't always be worrying about being killed by the criminal mastermind.Each director worked on a different segment in relative isolation from the rest. This went so far as having their own portions of the script written. The problem was that despite Eon Productions (the production company behind most of the Bond films) not owning the rights to Casino Royale, they had used many of the ""bits"" in other Bond films. So there wasn't much of the book left to adapt. In addition, it was felt that a serious alternative Bond film couldn't compete against the Albert R. Broccoli/Harry Saltzman-produced films. So Casino Royale producers Jerry Bresler, John Dark and Charles K. Feldman had different writer/director teams create their own, parodic Bond segments that would be loosely tied together--it was almost a filmic version of the ""Exquisite Corpse"" game, in which you fold a piece of paper so that you can't see other persons' work, and you have to continue the drawing on your section with only a couple visual anchors.Each segment features a different set of stars--the primary sets centering on Niven, Woody Allen, and Peter Sellers with Ursula Andress and Orson Welles. Those are all great actors, and great comedians in at least two cases. They all do a bit of their own schtick--in some cases, they demanded this. Woody does his neurotic New York Jew character, Peter Sellers rides the gray area between bumbling buffoon and suave playboy, with a couple generic Indian and Chinese impersonations thrown in for good measure, Orson Welles does his best Paul Masson Wine-pitching ""elder statesman"" demeanor, and also throws in a few of his more famous magic tricks. All of this stuff is good, but does it work as a unified film? No. And if that's not enough evidence for you, consider that the segments were further chopped up into set-pieces. There's the ""M"", or McTarry funeral stuff, the Niven car chase stuff, the Sellers/Andress romance stuff, and so on. Each set piece ends up being largely independent--you could almost see this as a series of skits on a similar theme. These facts make Casino Royale not quite work. It's certainly no match for a legitimate Bond film, despite the similarity of location-hopping, outrageous villains, spy gadgets and so on.But, in isolation, the segments tend to be good to excellent. The stretch with Bond visiting the faux M widow is probably the funniest. It also presages the Sir Robin section of Monty Python and the Holy Grail (1975), but bests it in a way, if only because of its extension. The madcap ending of the film is a lot of fun for its embrace of absurdism as a supreme aesthetic disposition--and it may have even influenced some later films. And the segments with the trippiest visuals, both in the climax, are a fantastic treat for any fan of surrealism. They're good enough to watch the film just to see them. The production design is incredible throughout the film. Not just for the surrealism, but the lush Edwardian and Victorian interiors, complete with copies and works in similar styles to unique, influential artists such as Gustav Klimt and Otto Dix.If we felt like being overly generous, we might be able to argue that the overarching mess of a plot was part of the point. This is a spoof of Bond, after all, and Bond novels and films tend to have sprawling plots--both geographically and narratively. We do travel to many exotic locales, meet many exotic people, doing exotic things, and we receive many plot intricacies and twists in both the typical Bond story and in Casino Royale. However, Bond films aren't quite convoluted or messy enough to deserve this kind of spoofing, so excusing the messiness of the whole to parodic intent seems an over-ambitious stretch.Casino Royale is worth seeing, particularly if you're a big Bond fan or a big fan of any of the cast, or even if you just like a lot of late 1960s/early 1970s big, madcap comedies. Just don't expect anything like a tight story.",Casino Royale
59,bobsgrock,About as weird and bizarre as any film you'll see.,6,5 April 2009,"I have no idea how to think after seeing this incredibly confusing and wild spoof of Ian Fleming novels. I understand of course that since they are spoofs, there is going to be somewhat a large amount of silliness, but I found even this to be a bit much. There are multiple scenes that just begin and just end as well as some scenes that don't fit in with the storyline at all. Then again, maybe there isn't one. I will say there are two major things going for this film: the cast and the seemingly unlimited amount of beautiful women that come across the screen. The cast is superb, including Peter Sellers, Orson Welles, David Niven, a young Woody Allen, and special appearances from William Holden, Deborah Kerr, even Peter O'Toole. I suppose if you are into the 1960s and want to try and understand that type of humor, this would be the right movie. There are some funny lines and scenes, but if you want to see a movie about a story that makes sense and will affect you emotionally, this is not it.",Casino Royale
60,sarastro7,What?!,8,11 August 2006,"I just had a genuine shock. I logged on to IMDb, and found that Casino Royale (1967) has a 5.1 rating. Okay, this proves that everybody else must have seen a somehow different movie than I have. I just watched it last night, and thoroughly enjoyed it. I'm quite fastidious in my tastes, a conservative rater, and no fan of James Bond movies, yet I deemed Casino Royale worthy of an 8 out of 10 rating - almost a 9. It was full of funny details, and clearly a cutting edge production by 1967 standards. It was a hell of a beautiful film, complete with a superb cast, male as well as female. Lots of understated humor, often bordering on the hilarious. The only reason this movie doesn't get a 9 from me is the very silly ending, with the Indians in the tee-pee parachutes and whatnot. Funny, but not that funny. But I thought the rest of the movie was positively splendid, and even Woody Allen (of whom I'm not a fan, either) actually managed to be pretty funny. So why this movie has an average rating of 5.1 is a total mystery to me. It was great. A born classic.",Casino Royale

62,Beta_Gallinger,There may have been a few too many writers and directors for this spoof!,5,11 December 2008,"Watching this unofficial 1967 James Bond film shortly after watching the official 2006 film of the same name (the name of the first book featuring the character), believe me, I KNEW not to expect much resemblance. The 2006 version with Daniel Craig is a serious and sometimes dark spy thriller, whereas this 1967 film is a spoof. Since the two movies are so different, despite having the same title (they're not even in the same genre), it may not be fair to compare them, but since they have the same title, it's kind of hard not to. The 2006 film works for what it is, but one would likely watch this 1967 film for laughs, which it unfortunately doesn't have too many of.After the disappearances and deaths of a number of agents, and after M, the head of MI6, dies in an explosion, Sir James Bond, a British secret agent, is lured out of retirement! His mission is to try and stop SMERSH, an evil organization! To confuse the enemy, all agents are renamed James Bond, 007! One of them, whose name is actually Evelyn Tremble, is sent to Casino Royale to compete with Le Chiffre, and is accompanied by Vesper Lynd, the richest agent in the world, who seems to be on Tremble's side, but is she really so innocent? In addition to that, quite a few people seem to work for SMERSH, but who is the head of this terrorist organization, the main enemy of them all?! This 1967 work of satire is considered by many to be incoherent. After seeing it myself, I'm going to have to agree, it is incoherent, and with such a handful of writers and directors, no wonder! With so many writers (apparently quite a few uncredited ones), perhaps a tad too many ideas came up for one movie, and it obviously didn't help with all those different directors, all with their own vision! The movie sometimes seems more like rather poor sketch comedy than a full-length story, dragging along for the most part. It is a silly comedy, and silliness can be entertaining, but not in this case. This film is hardly ever funny at all, just boring, listless, and pretty much thrown together, and it turned out to be a bit of a mess as a result. Woody Allen as Jimmy Bond, Sir James Bond's nephew, is probably the biggest highlight, and I think all the funniest scenes involve him, but he doesn't appear too much in the film. Allen appears briefly in this role at one point for what is probably one of the funniest scenes in the film, but then doesn't appear again until towards the end, for some equally funny gags, and that certainly doesn't make up for the vast majority of the film, which doesn't involve him.This version of ""Casino Royale"" is obviously not supposed to be taken seriously. I'm willing to watch a good James Bond spoof and laugh, but with this particular spoof, they just failed to make it work, and it doesn't help that it's over two hours long. Some claim this 1967 comedy is unwatchable, and I may not fully agree with them, but I think it at least comes close! I might be rating it a 4 if it weren't for Woody Allen's scarce appearances! Other than the fact that I laughed (usually VERY lightly) or smiled a little, the only positive thing I can say is that there are quite a few very attractive women in the film. This includes Ursula Andress, who played Honey Ryder, the ""Bond girl"" in the first official Bond film, 1962's ""Dr. No"", and plays Vesper Lynd in this film. Unfortunately, even though I'm a straight male, this didn't save the film for me. For the most part, this is just a boring, unfocused comedy, and maybe it would have worked had there not been such an abnormal number of writers and directors involved!",Casino Royale
63,gftbiloxi,How Many 007s Does It Take To Change a Light Bulb?,7,18 April 2005,"Eon Production's DR. NO was a great hit in the early 1960s, and Eon quickly snapped up the rights to the rest of Ian Flemming's novels about super spy James Bond--except for the CASINO ROYALE, which had already been purchased earlier by CBS for a 1950s television adaptation. When the property wound up at Columbia Pictures, they decided to create the satire to end all satires with a host of writers, five famous directors, and an all-star cast led by Peter Sellers. Unfortunately, Sellers' ego reached critical mass during the production and he was fired mid-way into filming--and suddenly roles that were originally envisioned as cameos had to be expanded to finish the project. The result is one of the most bizarre films imaginable.The story, such as it is, finds James Bond (David Niven) called out of retirement to deal with the sudden disappearance of secret agents all over the world. In order to confuse the unknown enemy, Sir James orders ALL secret agents to use the name James Bond--and before you can blink there are Bonds aplenty running wild all over the globe. Eventually all the Bonds, including (through the magic of editing) Peter Sellers, wind up at Casino Royale, where they confront the evil agents of SMERSH and a diabolical mad man with a plot to rule the world.The plot is absolute chaos, but that doesn't prevent the film from being a lot of fun to watch. The entire cast runs wild with some marvelous over-the-top performances, and whenever the writers can jam in a gag or a weird plot turn they do precisely that: Bond (Niven) is attacked by decoy ducks; counter-agent Mimi (Deborah Kerr) swings from a drain pipe; Bond's daughter by Mata Hari (Joanna Pettet) is kidnapped by a UFO; double agent Vesper (Ursula Andress) hides bodies in the deep freeze. And that's just for starters.At one point Niven blows up the locked door of a psychedelically decorated dudgeon with lysergic acid--better know as LSD--and in a way this is indicative of the entire film, which was made at the height of the 1960s ultra-mod movement: the whole thing has the feel of a blow-out acid trip, right down to flashing multicolored lights and swinging 60s fashions. It is visually arresting, to say the least. And then there is that famous Burt Bacharach score, easily one of the best of the decade, sporting Herp Albert on the main theme and Dusty Springfield's legendary performance of ""The Look of Love."" On the whole, the film is one of the most entertaining hodgepodges of talent and weirdness I've ever encountered, and it never fails to amuse. I've found that viewers tend to have extremely different reactions to this film--they either love it or hate it, so you may want to rent this one first. But it's one of my favorite guilty pleasures, and I recommend it for fans of the unexpectedly odd.Gary F. Taylor, aka GFT, Amazon Reviewer",Casino Royale

65,The_Movie_Cat,"First Rate Talent, Fourth Rate Material",4,6 July 1999,"What an appallingly unfunny movie Casino Royale is. Where its humour is more subtle than that of Austin Powers, it is nowhere near as amusing, and is dated in a negative way. There are the disconcertingly childish sound effects, coupled with, amongst others, Peter Sellers' repertoire of Asian accents. Watching the movie in a post-PC climate, this falls somewhere between offensive and plain embarrassing. David Niven, one of the original four choices for the REAL James Bond, proves here that not hiring him was a wise move. For a film populated by such solid talent as Sellers, Niven, Orson Welles, Woody Allen, and, even on a supporting level, Geoffrey Balydon and John Wells, it is amazing how dire it is. Maybe the problem is the timing, as in 1967 Bond was rapidly spoofing itself, henceforth making it impervious to mimickry. Also, while a 90 minute duration would have been acceptable, Casino Royale drags on for the disjointed length of a typical Bond film, making it tedious in the extreme. In conclusion, I would advise anyone against wasting two hours of their life watching this - though Woody Allen's screen time and the incredibly groovy end song ARE worth seeing, and help elevate this film to a ""4"".",Casino Royale

The novel by Ian Fleming was not bad  at least when I read it fifty years ago. This screenplay, however, must have been written when the writers were high on something, very high. So high, in fact, that this spoof never comes down to earth: it is, indeed, the wackiest spoof I've ever seen.But...as it is a spoof, I decided that I should, at long last, spend the 131 minutes necessary to see it  although, I must confess, I nearly went to sleep at least three times during that time. At that was at mid-day! Perhaps the fact that there were so many directors and writers has something to do with my inclination to drop off? Whatever the case, there is not much to say about this story; best leave that aside completely, as it is absolute nonsense (of course, it's a SPOOF!). The best fun in this piece comes from listening carefully for the deadpan jokes (from nearly all of the actors), the many sets that are obvious rip-offs from prior Bond movies, and the cameos from such a large cast, including Charles Boyer, John Huston, Jean Paul Belmondo and many others...Everybody overacts, naturally, with Orson Welles taking first prize, in my opinion. No, maybe that should go to Ronnie Barker? What about Deborah Kerr's performance  that was surely way over the top, wasn't it? Whew, too hard to choose. I'll just have to leave it to you to decide, should you see it.Don't be like me, and wait forty years, though.

70,timdalton007,An Incredible And Rare Waste Of Time & Talent,1,15 August 2015,"Though audiences today are likely to hear ""Casino Royale' and think of Daniel Craig's 2006 debut in the role of James Bond, it had in fact been filmed twice before then. The first was a live television version aired on American TV network CBS in 1954. It followed more than a decade later by a feature film produced by Charles K. Feldman. After an attempt to produce a co-production with ""official"" Bond film production company Eon starring Sean Connery was rejected (likely due to a similar situation have arisen due to issues with the rights to Thunderball), Feldman eventually settled on a different approach to filming Fleming's novel. That approach was parody.The result was released in 1967 ahead of the release of EON's You Only Live Twice. It was a big budget film for its time, costing $12 million at a time and featuring an all-star cast including David Niven, John Huston, Woody Allen, Peter Sellers, Orson Welles, Bernard Cribbins, Barbara Bouchet, Jacqueline Bisset and Ursula Andress among others. It also featured the work of five directors (including Huston and the underrated Val Guest) and was beset by behind the scenes issues that included a budget that doubled over production and clashes between Sellers (who reportedly wanted to the film to be a straight adaptation) and Welles (who regarded Seller as an ""amateur"").Looking at the film, it isn't hard to understand all the issues. It begins with M (played by Huston) and the heads of several spy agencies approaching the original James Bond (played by Niven) who is living in retirement in the English countryside on a massive estate. SMERSH is ravaging the spy world by killing agents from all sides and they want Bond to do something about it. When he refuses, M gives orders for Bond's estate to be destroyed which eventually leads to M's death and Bond taking over MI6. Already entrenched in parody mode, the film becomes increasingly absurd as it goes along as Bond decides all MI6 agents will now be known as ""James Bond"" to confuse SMERSH and goes on a recruiting drive. The recruiting drive brings agents including Vesper Lynd (Andress), the oddly named baccarat master Evelyn Tremble (Sellers), Bond's daughter from Mata Hari who is also named Mata as well as Bond's nephew Jimmy (Allen) amongst others. As if that wasn't enough, it goes into an episodic mode that takes the viewer from M's estate in Scotland, the gaming clubs of London, an auction of erotic images in Berlin and the titular casino where not only do Temble and Le Chiffre (Welles) have their card game but which also where SMERSH has its base.As the description may suggest, the film is a hodgepodge and a messy one at that. Indeed, the film's description by the British Film Institute as ""an incoherent all-star comedy"" is an accurate one though to call it a comedy may be stretching the definition of the word. Many times the film, despite being a parody, isn't funny at all but rather is dull and tedious as it stumbles along from one episode to another. The five different directors and the variety of writers who wrote it mean that the film completely, totally and utterly lacks any kind of cohesion in terms of visual style or indeed tone. The film's last section, a free for all fight sequence set in the casino that ends in an explosion and the various James Bond's appearing in heaven playing harps, is a summation of not just the film but all that is wrong with it: it's a mess.Which isn't to write it off completely. Sections of the film are actually surprisingly faithful to the original novel despite the comic overtones such as the Niven Bond's choice of car (which matches that of Fleming's novels) and it's especially true of the section with Sellers, Andress and Welles set at the casino in the middle of the film The card game is largely played straight once Welles' Le Chiffre gets past doing some magic tricks and Sellers doing a comedy Indian accent. Even in the truly odd torture sequence, which becomes an assault on the mind of Tremble/Bond, there's echoes of Fleming's novel such as Bond finding himself sitting in a chair with the seat removed from it, thus making it even more uncomfortable for Bond. Of all the actors in the film, Sellers is probably the one who comes off the best though his appearances in the film see him dipping in and out before eventually just disappearing (a result apparently of behind the scenes issues) while many of the others are effectively wasted on frankly poor material.At the end of the day though, it's hard not to be utterly disappointed in the 1967 Casino Royale. It doesn't work at all either as a Bond film or as a parody of it. It's a hodgepodge of styles and tones that never works either in a way that's either episodic or as a whole. It's a rare waste of talent both in front of and behind the camera and, as a result, deserves the title of worst Bond film ever made.",Casino Royale

72,Bogmeister,Everyone is James Bond in Psychedelic Mishmash,5,6 May 2007,"This was the Bond title unable to be used by the filmmakers of the regular Bond film series, until the end of the century (they finally got to it for the restart in 2006). So, the intent here was a spoof of the then-wildly popular Bond/spy mania of the mid-sixties. Of course, this wasn't the first such effort; others already began the ""Our Man Flint"" duo film series and ""The Man From UNCLE"" on TV was in full swing, not to mention ""Get Smart."" So, how to outdo them? Get five top notch directors. Get as many sixties stars as possible. Get everything but the kitchen sink (literally, in the over-the-top climax). The original intent was to have each director do their own little mini-movie spoof - an anthology; they ended up editing everything together into one so-called film. A heady brew and, predictably, largely incomprehensible. In addition, actor Sellers, the nominal star, left before completing all his scenes, so his personal trajectory is less than smooth - as if a scene is missing, naturally. If you pay very close attention, you might be able to follow about 50% of the plot, but do you really want to put so much effort into watching a comedy? Some of this editing is quite clumsy: the first pre-credits scene, a short one, features Sellers, as if the producers are pointing out to us that he is indeed in this movie (he doesn't show up again until 40 minutes later). Welles doesn't show up until the 80-minute mark. The first sequence concentrates on Niven, the real James Bond. He's in retirement but is forced back into a weird plot by the heads of all the world's spy agencies. This first half-hour, except for the scene with the lions, is slow and mostly stupid, not funny-stupid as intended, involving Kerr and a lot of dull fun at the expense of the Irish, for some reason, and painfully obvious joking about Bond's sexual magnetism. There's also one sly poke at the real Bond film series and its gadgetry; apparently, that Bond, of ""Goldfinger"" and ""Thunderball"" fame, is actually a replacement for the pure spy played by Niven, who looks down at the concept of gadgets. Things start to pick up a bit later, with the intro of several femme fatales, played by some of the most ravishing starlets of the sixties: Andress of ""Dr.No"" fame, Bouchet as the new Moneypenny, Lavi and Pettet as Bond's daughter, Mata (why Pettet did not become a major star is baffling to me). Much of the non-plot involves Niven taking over M's operations and naming a bunch of other agents James Bond to confuse the enemy - SMERSH (lifted straight from the books). We finally do see similar plot lines to Fleming's novel, involving villain heavy Le Chiffre (Welles) and one of the Bonds (Sellers) dueling at cards (Baccarat - dramatized differently in the 1954 TV version, yet eerily similar).Curiously, it's not Sellers who provides the more amusing scenes in this confusing fest, as we would expect. No, that honor falls to Woody Allen, as Bond's nephew, and Welles in his brief scenes conducting some off-the-cuff magic show. Allen's highlight is his very first scene, involving the firing squad. Allen, previously seen in ""What's New,Pussycat?,"" now proves to be one of the most natural comedians for the silver screen. His mannerisms and body movement recall some of the great comedians of the silent era, Chaplin & Keaton, especially evident in the scenes where he can't speak (a mental block whenever Uncle Bond is around). Famous starlet of the seventies Ms.Bisset pops up briefly in a small role as yet another femme fatale. There's also some mildly amusing commentary on the division of East and West Berlin - yes, this was the height of the Cold War - including some almost-clever use of color. But, all the psychedelic stuff, crammed into the tail end of this, is very outdated and useful only if the viewer has smoked a lot of weed. This movie also has one of the worst musical scores - almost like nails on chalkboard to me. If you're in a really good mood, you may be able to sit through this long movie comfortably; if not, you'll probably get pretty antsy as the last third begins - and that's where most of Woody's scenes are.

There's many scenes that seem out of place and are solely there to evoke laughter... this is very much out of the ordinary with previous Bond films, but the more you watch the film, the more you realize that they weren't trying to create a Bond film... they were trying to create an absurdist comedy.Unfortunately the movie isn't funny... perhaps it was slightly more funny back in 1967, but I honestly didn't laugh once through the entire 2hour movie. So in the end, it's not a Bond film, and it's not a comedy. It's just... pointless. Utterly pointless.",Casino Royale
74,cariart,"Big, Overblown Train Wreck of a Bond Spoof...",2,19 April 2006,"There are those who consider 1967's CASINO ROYALE a masterpiece, one of the funniest, campiest satires of the decade...if you are one of those misguided fans, read no further...because I truly HATE this film! The story behind the film is a classic case of ""More Makes Less""...Charles K. Feldman had purchased the rights to Fleming's novel, with dreams of producing his own 'James Bond' adventure, and raking in some of the millions in revenues that Eon Productions was making. He knew that Sean Connery was the essential element in the Bond franchise, and that the actor was winding up his contract with YOU ONLY LIVE TWICE. So Feldman approached Connery about starring in his film.Connery was burned out on playing the super-spy, but he listened to Feldman's pitch, then made a salary demand that was way, WAY out of the producer's range. Sadly, Feldman dropped the idea of Connery as Bond, and considered other options.After toying with and discarding the idea of other actors in the role (Connery was a tough act to follow!), Feldman had a 'revelation'; if he made ""Casino Royale"" a spoof of Bond movies, he could cast a variety of 'big' stars as comic 007s, and no one would make comparisons to Connery's 'serious' approach of the role. Hiring an ever-increasing pool of screenwriters, and getting a variety of directors to film various sequences, based on their availability, an 'ultimate' James Bond satire began production.Some of the ideas were quite creative; to bring in past 'Bond' co-star Ursula Andress in a key role; to hire legendary actors who would have been 'believable' in a 'serious' Bond film (Orson Welles as 'Le Chiffre', John Huston as 'M', William Holden as the American intelligence boss); to cast Fleming's own first choice for Bond, David Niven, as the 'original', now retired Sir James Bond; and to include two of the most brilliant comic actors around, Peter Sellers and Woody Allen, as variations of 007.So what went wrong? What DIDN'T? Peter Sellers, trying to move beyond comedy, thought he was hired to actually play 007 'straight', and caused considerable delays when he realized he wasn't going to be allowed to; Woody Allen, despite giving the funniest performance in the film, was refused the right to rewrite the script (which was being filmed in scattered pieces, all over the lot), and publicly blasted the film; there was no cohesiveness in any of the various plot lines, making the film editors' job a nightmare; even the music score, by Burt Bacharach, teetered between light-hearted bounce and silliness and more serious motifs (represented by the song, ""The Look of Love""), uncertain which direction the film was going.By the time the production 'wrapped', I think Feldman wished he'd paid Connery's salary! Then, to top things off, the Bond craze peaked out, and audiences began to find other avenues of film entertainment. Even had CASINO ROYALE been a 'good' film (which it wasn't), it would have had difficulties making back production costs, as 'Bond Fever' subsided.After being universally blasted by critics, CASINO ROYALE quickly faded from view...until a new generation anointed the film a 'camp' classic, so 'bad' that it was 'good'...",Casino Royale

Casino Royale is an overlong mess from start to finish. How could they use Peter Sellers and not make him the least bit funny? That's just one of the huge stars that walk in and out of this bore and they all look like they just stepped out of a sideshow carnival and just happened to be on a movie set.The plot about having multiple Bonds could have been funny but is dealt with like a six-grade school play. Like other films with too many directors (I think there were three credited) the mix doesn't stand for higher quality. It was a precursor to the limitless 90's films with cameos galore (eg. Austin Powers in Goldmember) that somehow almost always had some enjoyment to them. Not this one.

What went wrong? The film start off OK, with M trying to bribe the 'original' James Bond out of retirement. I did like this little comment of the original Bond, as if its stating James Bond is a code name. It then takes a turn for the worse, when they decide to have all agents called James Bond (even the girls). After all the training, the film focuses on Peter Sellers version of Bond, who is brought in because he is an expert at poker. It then gets more weirder and confusing when 007s daughter is introduced.The character of Le Chiffre, played by Orson Welles, is actually quite a well played character, with many references to the original story. The biggest exception is the playing of magic tricks. When the true villains turns out to be Bonds nephew (Woody Allen), who has a plan to make all women beautiful and all mens smaller than him. This then turns into a complete mess. Moneypennys daughter is kidnapped by UFOs and Bond asks Frankenstein for direction. Once the battle in the casino commences, we get all sorts fighting out. The french, police (from old black & white footage), cowboys, indians, dogs and seal ions!

Actually, the only one being even remotely funny is Woody Allen, but his short performance is nowhere near enough to improve the overall impression of this colossal flop.Considering the cast involved, one would have expected a great movie, but what we got was a complete mess. I really fail to understand what the producer, the 5 (?) directors and the actors had in mind while making this movie. It is unbelievable that the likes of John Huston (one of the greatest motion picture directors of all time), David Niven, William Holden, Orson Welles (another of the greatest motion picture directors of all time), Ursula Andress, Jacqueline Bisset, Peter Sellers, etc., all went collectively berserk at the same time!

First half of the movie is actually very fun, funny and sometimes even clever, but the second half is where the whole thing breaks apart gloriously and your brain starts to hurt from what your eyes are witnessing. Which is actually a shame, because if movie continued like it started, this would be a very good parody of spy films.

There apparently isn't anything to get since the movie is one big patch of senseless scenes as it wasn't, due to the fact that Sellers quit the movie, even properly finished(or so I'm told). Me and my friends had to rewind some scenes more than 5 times as we didn't have the slightest clue what was going on. We were stoned as hell, but still, now I at least know ""Casino Royale"" is even funnier that I previously thought. To see such a cast is a true rarity, if not privilege, and they make the best of it. I don't remember ever wanting to be in a movie as much as I wanted to be in this Bond satire, because there are such and so many gorgeous women in it I can't even begin to name them all. Peter Sellers shows once again why he's the funniest man ever and David Niven delivers a solid performance as well, but both show they were having a blast making this parody. But the best of them all are Orson Welles and Woody Allen. He's hilarious. Admittedly the first half is sort of boring, but the 2nd one makes up for it, especially memorable is the final outrageous scene in the Casino.

81,SkullScreamerReturns,The worst James Bond film ever,2,5 October 2020,"This is the unofficial comedy version of James Bond. I've known about its existence since my childhood but never actually seen it. I remember the vhs tape sitting on the shelf of a kiosk where I used to buy candy, so there is that nostalgia of imaging what the movie would be like. Later I've read that it's not like usual Bond films, so I was aware to expect something different. But I still got surprised how...not good it was.Don't get me wrong: it's camp. If you love that kind of mood, then you might like it. But I just can't stand most camp, and I'm guessing this is not even particularly good effort in that category. I also don't really like Peter Sellers or Woody Allen. They've done some better stuff too, but in general, there are always some actors whom you just dislike for some reason. All in all, this movie is like a coctail of a lot of things that I don't like.The plot is all over the place, the two hour movie is way too long for a silly comedy...I was so waiting for it to end. There are some mildly funny moments that I kind of liked but they were rare and not super funny anyway. Also another good thing are the sets. At times it looks like watching an actual Bond film. I sense that there is potential for a genuinely funny Bond parody but somehow it doesn't work. The comedy is overdone, the randomness of every possible joke and slapstick must be thrown to the screen feels like trying too much to be funny, and the cheesy brass music just underlines that and feels annoying to me.It's a comedy that I personally didn't find much funny, but I guess it's not quite the worst movie I've seen. Just very boring. I know I'm being a bit harsh because I just don't like this style in general. If you think you're more a fan of 60's-70's camp humor then feel free to imagine a couple more stars to my rating. But I'm happy the movie is over...",Casino Royale
82,domino1003,That Interesting British Wit,9,20 September 2008,"I grew up watching ""Casino Royale,"" and have grown to love the lunacy that this film shows. Seems that there's a REAL James Bond (David Niven), who is a leisurely gentleman enjoying his retirement. But representatives from international spy agencies wants him out of retirement when spies are being killed around the world. At this point, things get incredibly silly. Soon there are multiple Bonds, including baccarat expert Evelyn Tremble (Peter Sellers), who plays a mean game against Le Chiffre (Magic obsessed Orson Wells).The film is a frenzied mix. It seems to be multiple stories in the film, with David Niven being the common link. The film has 5 directors and multiple writers on the script (or scripts). Plot lines seem to not exist at some points. There are the Bond Beauties, including Ursula Andress. Her scenes with Peter Sellers (Especially ""The Look of Love"" scene)are wonderful.The humor is dated, and some references may go over people's heads, but it's still a wonderful bit of insanity.",Casino Royale
83,willcundallreview,A Bond spoof that is not near being good,4,22 April 2014,"Rating-4/10Casino Royale(67) is a James Bond spin off which basically nearly misses every mark and although I believe some people will and can enjoy this piece, it just isn't a funny film. My review may reflect very very badly on it but I gave it the slightest of higher marks due to it's quirkiness and that a good budget was put into also, but nevertheless this film even with a high budget and good cast really isn't even an average film, I will give my reasons why in this review.The story is absurd and although it is based on Flemings novel it starts to be like but then just falls and you can't help but feel the film has failed as a film and as an entire production. If you want to a film to laugh at well this is not one which will make you laugh in any way, I did say some would enjoy the quirkiness and that the story is so I guess this film has some fans at least, but it must only be for how strange it is as a piece. Another thing to say is the story isn't a great drama either and the more serious moments are ruined.The script is probably just about the worst part about this film as it basically outlines everything that is wrong with this film and completely breaks down just about when Woody Allen make's his appearance near the beginning of the film. The film has about 6 directors and they don't do the worst job ever done in directing and this could be one point that is given an OK rating from me as some interesting things can be found within this rather messy film yes indeed.Now to the acting well it is done OK I guess and some fantastic actors take part in this film including an Ex Bond girl herself, a twice Oscar nominated actor and a Director who in this is acting but who won three Oscars for screen writing. You would think this film would have it all and in all the right departments but if you said that you couldn't be more wrong truthfully, just please I won't say much more about all the criticisms of this film but see it for yourself, go watch and see if it makes you laugh, I am near sure you will be disappointed.I enjoyed the visuals which were fairly good and the kind of strange torture chamber a certain character is put in(well torture to the lightest degree in this film), it looked kind of neat and some of the stunts done are pretty damn good even for a comedy which you would expect to have stupid explosions and silly crashes, not too shabby on that side. I think the ending was the best part if any part had to be named the best part as it starts to get faster and the film seems to realise it is a spoof and accelerates at a fast rate to become spoof film, but way way way too little too late for that.The thing with this is, there is a lot of story to tell and that can be seen in the 2006 Eon production of Bond with Daniel Craig which well, makes this seem a little spec in the dust compared to most Bond films. I even felt the humour was there at times and they failed to capitalise and so you are left feeling bored and disappointed at that you have to endure.Overall a just about very poor or if you want Very under average film warranting a 4/10 from me meaning it was firmly a Very Poor movie, I would actually say this is worth a watch if not just to be able to say you have seen every Bond adaption there is but realise this is not even on par with the worst of Bond films.",Casino Royale
84,majikstl,The Royale Treatment,8,19 April 2004,"CASINO ROYALE is one of the truly great bad movies of all time. It is a wonderfully weird, bold, funny and incoherent mess of a movie. What should stink of embarrassing desperation, instead proves to cheerfully insane, unpredictable and remarkably free of common sense.The film was intended to be the ultimate spy spoof, an attempt to out-Bond the James Bond movies and their innumerable imitators. To this end, the untold number of writers and directors involved have opted to take the everything-but-the-kitchen-sink approach to storytelling, mixed with a cut-and-paste style of editing. It is obvious that no one gave the slightest thought to creating a genuine spy film and instead approached the film with a devil-may-care attitude. As far as the actors are concerned, CASINO ROYALE seems to be little more than an excuse to have a multimillion dollar party at the studio's expense. As a satire of Bond films, CASINO is adequate; as a satire of the then trendy-swinging-cool-hip-with-it-now youth films of the era, it succeeds beautifully.Basically you have a whole bunch of big name stars -- past their prime, but still with box office credibility -- ridiculing the very youth market that was squeezing them off the theatre marquees. Yet, the film has no malice; it is as bright and breezy as a screwball comedy with just a touch of British absurdity. It is amazing that a film that is so overblown, over produced and over budgeted can still be so light and airy. Despite a chaotic recipe, the film has a lot of really great ingredients. The cast is slumming in style (where else can you find Orson Welles, John Huston and Woody Allen hamming it up in the same film or Peter O'Toole, George Raft, Charles Boyer and Jean-Paul Belmondo dropping in for fleeting cameos?) And you have one of the best soundtrack albums ever, including Herb Alpert's title track and Dusty Springfield's sexy, sultry rendition of the Bacharach and David classic ""The Look of Love."" Plus, you get Woody Allen as an evil genius out to take over the world and Deborah Kerr dangling from the drain pipe of a Scottish castle.And, to some extend, the film gets Bond right. As the legit James Bond series grinds on, getting ever more pompous, humorless and heavy-handed, CASINO ROYALE sees the whole genre for what it is: an absurdist lark. Indeed, if CASINO ROYALE has a soul mate, it is not GOLDFINGER, but the ""Batman"" TV series, another pop culture phenomenon designed to deflate pretense with overblown villains, outrageously silly situations, off-the-wall cameos and a tongue placed firmly in the cheek.What's not to love?",Casino Royale

There are a raft of cameos in it (inc. George Raft), with Peter Sellers who was fooled into it believing it to be a serious Bond film, as if he could really play 007!Its also got loads of gorgeous girls, obviously done to excess to parody the usual straight laced series. But amongst these beauties are Barbara Bouchet, a rather stunning German actor playing Moneypenny, Ursula Andress (Switzerland) of 'Dr. No' fame who actually looks better and more sexy in this despite being 5 years older and the underrated English beauty Joanna Pettet playing Mata Bond. Other Beauties are Daliah Lavi (Palestine), Deborah Kerr (Scotland) who was holding her own despite being several years older than the others and proving what a stunning beauty and great actor she was, Jacqueline Bisset (England - Miss Goodthighs), Mireillie Darc (France - Jag Driver), Alexandra Bastedo (England - famous from 'The Champions' TV series) Gabriella Licudi (England), Tracey Crisp (England) and Elaine Taylor (England). A good few of the regular Bond movies were in it as well, Caroline Munro (England - who later did The Spy Who Loved Me), Jeanne Roland (England - a minor role in 'You Only Live Twice') Milton Reid (Indian) who also appeared in 'The Spy Who Loved Me', and 'Dr. No' and an extra in a third, Ursula Andress of course in 'Dr. No' and Angela Scoular (England) who played Buttercup (in the Bath with Niven) and was a Bond Girl in 'On Her Majesty's Secret Service', Vladek Shaybal (Poland - From Russia With Love) and Bert Kwouk (England) who did about 3 in very minor roles.
It also had 2 great cars, a 4.5l Bentley Special and an Open top Jaguar E-Type.The best thing it had going for it was the music score written by Burt Bacharach and Hal David, with a great song 'The Look of Love' sung by Dusty Springfield, if it was a better quality film I would have given it 10, but it was great fun, so it gets an 8. The regular Bond films missed out by not casting many of the stunning girls from this film, Barbara Bouchet was more beautiful than any of the regular Bond Girls and Joanna Pettet and Dahlia Lavi would easily have graced Bond's Bed far better than most that did. And despite the beauties in this it was not focused on sex, Bond did not shag any, the only sex was between Tremble and Vesper, Cooper and Moneypenny, and that was not shown just the lead up.

86,chuck-reilly,"""Casino Royale"" is one huge blast from the past",6,26 May 2010,"File this one under ""The Worst Movie I Ever Liked."" With enough actors, directors, writers and producers to sink an entire studio, the 1967 James Bond spoof ""Casino Royale"" has to be seen to be believed. What other film would be so inane as to have Woody Allen starring as James Bond's diminutive nephew Jimmy Bond. Not that Woody doesn't do a fine and decent job as the master spy's insecure and psychologically imbalanced relative. And then there's David Niven having the time of his life as the real James Bond, fresh from retirement on his palatial estate (with roaming lions) and ready to take on the evil SMERSH organization---despite a very bad stuttering problem. To add to his speech impediment dilemma, James is still pining away for his lost love, Mata Hari, and can't think of anyone or anything else. Since Mata Hari was executed during World War I, Bond's mourning has been going on for 50 years (which would make him around 80 years old). Orson Welles (probably needing a paycheck) is on hand as bad guy Le Chiffre. Over-acting to an extreme never seen on the screen before, Welles at least provides some good belly laughs (for himself). He's the real heavy in more ways than one. For beauty worshipers, Ursulla Andress has never looked better as femme fatale Vesper Lind. It's too bad her Swedish accent makes her dialog totally incomprehensible. Peter Sellers is the actual star of this colossal mess playing card expert Evelyn Tremble. When asked if Evelyn is a girl's name, Sellers responds indignantly ""No, it's my name."" If that doesn't get a chuckle from the audience, the endless bad puns and outrageous antics of this cavalcade of everyone with a SAG card keeps on trying and never lets up. Of course, it's all to the detriment of the movie, but I doubt if anyone involved in this fiasco really cared much about that. Everyone looks like they're having a good time, and they probably were. For film history buffs, ""Casino Royale"" was also the debut for Jacqueline Bisset (billed as Jacky Bisset in the credits). Her role is small but memorable and she was able to make an impression with viewers and not get lost in the film's deluge of madness.To say they don't make them like this anymore would be the understatement of the year. Spy spoofs are now a thing of the distant past and the Swinging Sixties are long gone. But ""Casino Royale"" isn't a bad place to revisit that era despite its overblown attempts at parody, camp, and ""in-crowd"" humor. And if someone wants to know why Charles Boyer, William Holden, Jean-Paul Belmondo and John Huston are all in this film, there is no answer.

87,LCShackley,A good evening's romp,7,24 March 2007,"Having recently watched several corny Roger Moore-era bond films, I wonder why the Bond purists have such a cow about CASINO ROYALE! This is a fun romp, especially for those of us who grew up in the 1960s, because it boils down the fun (and the sounds) of the decade in a surrealistic and nonsensical adventure.This is the kind of movie that you shouldn't turn off too soon, because if you don't like the current scene, you'll find something completely different in 10 minutes that you may like just fine. The concept is zany, and there are plenty of in-jokes and barbs about the ""Broccoli Bond"" films. There are references to plenty of other film icons too, from BORN FREE to MOULIN ROUGE to WHAT'S NEW PUSSYCAT (all reflected in Burt Bacharach's score). And as many people have commented, the art direction, costumes, etc. are first rate, and there are probably more beautiful girls in this movie than in many other Bond films. A few of the science-fiction special effects have that Gerry Anderson look to them, but most are good for the era. The psychedelic film effects look brilliant on a big HDTV.Speaking of Bacharach, this is a 60s score that bears repeated listening without cringing (unlike many others from this era). Lots of different moods handled well, a great theme (one of the best Bond themes) and a memorable Oscar-nominated love song.Ronnie Corbett has a wonderful scene, as do many of the other supporting characters. And David Niven gracefully holds it together (as well as can be done with so many writers and directors).And that last scene...now I know where Mel Brooks got the finale for BLAZING SADDLES.

90,TheHonestCritic,"Here we have a Bond spoof, is it a good movie? Well.....",4,24 October 2020,"""Casino Royale"" (1967), let me just start off by saying that when I first watched this ""film"", I did like it. However, every time I watched it after, I suddenly began to realize how dumb it really is. This ""movie"" has a very incoherent and confusing mess of a story, standard to horrible acting and a jumbled soundtrack. As far as the story goes, it's supposed to be a James Bond parody. A parody film is hard to get right. There are very few of them out there that do original source material justice, but most of them just fall flat. ""Casino Royale"" falls flat on it's face and it's a shameful ripoff of an iconic film franchise. Another big issue with this ""movie"" is that it includes way too much. One of the most important cardinal rules with movies or TV shows is: less is more. The biggest goal is to keep it simple, but not too simple. Otherwise, you will get a mangled mess. This plot of this ""film"" is the epitome of a jumbled mess. As for the acting, the cast is absolutely insane. When I first saw the cast list, I thought: ""wow, talk about a star-studded lineup!"" This ""film"" stars: David Niven, Peter Sellers, Ursula Andress, Joanna Pettet, Daliah Lavi, Woody Allen, Barbara Bouchet, Terence Cooper, Deborah Kerr, Orson Welles and more. Much more! That's not even the full main cast list, there are also several cameos. Go read the list for yourself! Of course, a mammoth cast of all-star actors and actresses can be a good or bad thing for a movie. An example of a good all-star movie that gets it right is, ""It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World"" (1963). That movie takes almost every advantage it possibly can with it's star-studded cast and has fun with it. Examples of poorly done all-star films are, ""The Cannonball Run"" (1981) and also ""Cannonball Run 2"" (1984). Those two movies had quite a cast lineup, but poor writing and direction marred them from shining. Unfortunately, the same problems have occurred here in ""Casino Royale"". The only somewhat decent performances come from David Niven, Peter Sellers, Woody Allen and Orson Welles. They were the only actors who seemed to give some kind of effort. All four of them did the best they could with the bad script. Had the ""film"" been better written, it could have been a classic. Such a shame! Don't even get me started on the soundtrack. This is one of the most jumbled film scores I have ever heard. The tone is inconsistent, it doesn't know what kind of mood to give, and so on. Well, like I've said before, bad movies almost always equal bad soundtracks! Now for the positive elements in this pile of garbage. The sets/locations and the special effects are perfect. All of the sets/locations are great and help give the ""movie"" a beautiful atmosphere. Finally, the special effects are well-done and still hold up to this day. Yes, some do get a little bit cheesy, but they still work very well. ""Casino Royale"" is a disgrace to the Bond franchise. Yes, it may be a parody, but it's an absolutely terrible one. The sad thing is, out of all the live-action Bond spoofs I've seen, this one is the best of the worst. That's not saying much, because they all suck! Still, this ""movie"" is better than any of Daniel Craig's Bond films and definitely better than ""Never Say Never Again"" (1983). I rate this ""film"" 2 out of 5 stars on my scale, which equates to 4 out of 10 IMDB stars. If you ever feel the desire to watch a Bond spoof, including this one, just spare yourself the two hours and watch a movie worth watching. The sad thing is, this ""movie"" is better than the new ""Casino Royale"" (2006). How ironic, right? Take that, Daniel Craig. A spoof Bond film is better than your excuses for Bond movies!",Casino Royale
91,the amorphousmachine,All over the place zany comedy!,4,21 July 2009,"Zany is one word to describe this film in 'Casino Royale', and it really is quite all over the place. A stellar cast for its time, but that doesn't make it a great movie. Woody Allen excels but we wait far too long for him to appear as the Dr Noah/Jimmy Bond. David Niven is usual polite self, and film cuts across narratives from his Bond to Peter Seller's version of Bond. I found the movie quite irritating and confusing. Several directors indicate that this film had problems, or the humour was derivative of Ian Fleming's famous Bond novels. I am not sure.Orsen Welles is quite cute as the bad, and seems stuck in the sitting position. Apparently he and Sellers didn't get along, and that would make sense because the scenes with the two actors together felt unnatural- primarily because they were filmed on separate days so they didn't have to see each other! One of the Two Ronnies is in this film, and he is quite funny! I lost track ofthis movie, and was glad when it ended. I think Austin Powers is a better spoof on the Bond saga, as this film was all over the place. Better off seeing the actual 'Casino Royale' with Daniel Craig........much better! ** out of *****!",Casino Royale

David Niven offers us a chaste, insightful, stuttering Bond, capable of generating plans to confuse the enemy by multiplying Bonds everywhere. Everything that happens does not need a thread: what keeps you trapped is the surprise, the visual power, the unheard of charms of Orson Wells who steals the film while Peter Sellers recites sayings with a foreign accent. It is one of the best movies of all time. The important thing here is the experience of seeing it and not knowing the details that, because they are intricate, do not help what we as viewers should feel. This movie is wonderful.",Casino Royale
93,aramis-112-804880,What the 1960s was All About,7,23 July 2012,"James Bond spoof ""Casino Royale"" is what the '60s revolution was all about, at least in its early stages. Colorful, fun, with a handful good ideas; but self-indulgent, irresponsible, unstructured and having a sense that it was more important than it was.Agent turned producer Charles Feldman owned the rights to CASINO ROYALE, Ian Fleming's first James Bond novel. Unable to reach an agreement with the Broccoli/Saltzman team to make a legit James Bond movie, Feldman decided to make the greatest spoof ever in the manner of his previous hit, ""What's New Pussycat"" (the two are companion films and should be watched in tandem).Peter Sellers, famous in England but a rising star in America after ""The Pink Panther,"" seemed a good choice for a spoof Bond. Sellers' role in the film's unraveling is outlined in THE LIFE AND DEATH OF PETER SELLERS (the book). Sellers was finally fired before the whole project went down the tubes. The pieces were picked up by David Niven and others. Any usable bits of Sellers' role were picked out and sewn together with lots of other material added for some semblance of a plot.The plot as I understand it: David Niven is the real James Bond, retired. His name as been given to a flamboyant young man (a not-so-veiled wink to Connery). M lures Bond (Niven) out of hiding to deal with SMERSH, Soviet counter-intelligence.With the help of Vesper Lynd (Ursula Andress) Bond recruits Evelyn Tremble (Peter Sellers), a baccarat expert (never mind that baccarat is a card game requiring no skill), to beat Le Chiffre (Orson Welles) at baccarat at Casino Royale. Le Chiffre has been gambling SMERSH funds and if Tremble beats Le Chiffre they will destroy not only Le Chiffre but break SMERSH's bank.So far, so good. Unfortunately, thanks to Sellers' irresponsibility and early firing, that plot takes about half an hour of screen time, spread out. The rest of the movie is an episodic mish-mash.Niven's Bond, out of retirement, gets involved in a grouse shoot in Scotland at a country house that is really a cover for girl spies run by Mimi (Deborah Kerr). Directed by John Huston, better known for dramas and noirs than comedies, this segment quickly begins to pall. The Scottish section (actually shot in Ireland) is is full of lovely women, yet is mind-bogglingly tedious (if you survive this you can make the rest of the flick).Bond's illegitimate daughter by Mata Hari sneaks into East Germany to steal ""art work"" Le Chiffre is auctioning to raise quick cash to replace what he has embezzled from SMERSH. Mocking German expressionistic cinema, the East German part is the funniest continuous sequence in the movie. It stars Anna Quayle, Bernard Cribbins, and a delightfully wacky Ronny Corbett playing a SMERSH agent with a faulty pacemaker. Joanna Pettet is more than eye candy, running around in a skimpy costume; some of the best lines in the movie come from her scenes with Corbett. Yet Pettet's role makes little sense. The movie is clearly set in the 1960s and came out in 1967. Mata Hari was executed as a spy 1917. We are to believe Mata Bond is 60 years old at the very least? But who cares, this is ""Casino Royale,"" not some serious bit of film-making. After East Germany (which is beautifully contrasted with West Germany) and Sellers' abrupt departure, Mata Bond (Pettet) is abducted by a space ship (Why not?) and taken back to Casino Royale as a hostage by the mysterious baddie Doctor Noah. (""Doctor No."" Get it?) Fine. Once Pettet is in street clothes her character is no longer intriguing. Hers is not the only character who drops in and out of this movie and she has a reason to. To this point, ""Casino Royale"" has been largely incomprehensible. When Bond (Niven) goes to rescue his daughter, the movie changes tones. It becomes inexplicable. A lot of nonsense breaks loose that involves bubbles flying everywhere, statues coming to life, an attack by cowboys (and Indians! -- jumping out of planes, no less, yelling ""Geronimo!"" Holy Smoke.) And that's just a tiny sampling. What's going on? Why do we have frivolous cameos of George Raft and Jean-Paul Belmondo? It's ""Casino Royale"" that's why! To confuse SMERSH, Bond (Niven) early on orders all agents to be known as James Bond. Here is a list of main actors who are code-named ""James Bond"": Niven, Sellers, Allen, Andress, Pettet, Barbara Bouchet (who never looked lovelier), Daliah Lavi (ditto), and an actor named Terence Cooper. Cooper's character's name is Cooper. He holds a special place in this movie. Selected by Miss Moneypenny as the world's most desirable man, yet trained to resist the advances of any woman, Cooper (actor and character) vanishes without trace early on, only to reappear without explanation for the climax. Bond's ploy does more than confuse SMERSH. It confuses the audience.Sellers has some good bits here and there. Woody Allen's escape from a firing squad is priceless. The German scenes are brilliantly conceived. On the down side, Orson Welles, a brilliant casting coup as Le Chiffre, looks bored (as he probably was, with Sellers). And many of the familiar faces in the stellar cast, while excellent, are parochially British (Derek Nimmo, Ronnie Corbett, Bernard Cribbins, etc.) But then, London was the center of the universe for the 1960s.The best part of the movie, whose brightness never stales, is the music. Casino Royale's theme is at least as good as any of the better known ""legitimate Bond"" songs. Also featured is a necessary slower section where Dusty Springfield sings ""The Look of Love."" A whacked-out James Bond song after the Jackie Bisset scene nearly steals the whole movie. Even the repeated music cues are never tiring.",Casino Royale
94,jeremy3,"Not as good as ""What's Up Pussy Cat""?",5,7 August 2008,"Although, the plots of What's Up Pussy Cat? and Casino Royale are very different, they both were made about the same time, and feature both Peter Sellers and Woody Allen. However, while the former was wildly entertaining, the latter was confusing and winding. This movie is not a bad movie by today's standards, but probably a big flop when made. The problem is that the writers/producers were trying to get too much spoof of the James Bond genre in. This just confuses and bores the audience eventually.What I do like about the movie is David Niven. He is very good as an older gentleman who has matured and wearied of the world. He is extremely bashful when he enters the bathtub of a beautiful woman. Yet, it is this very bashfulness that makes him more prized. In fact, Niven's Bond is the exact opposite of the Connery and Moore Bond portrayals.I also liked Peter Sellers. Almost every other role I have seen of Peter Sellers has him being some sort of lunatic. In fact, I heard that in real life Sellers was quite introverted and rather dry. This must have been the real Peter Sellers. He is very proper and more of an Oliver Hardy than a Stan Laurel. It was fascinating seeing this more real Peter Sellers than one typically sees of him on camera.I didn't think that Woody Allen had enough of a role to shine in his role. His role seemed stilted and unbelievable, whereas in What's Up Pussy Cat, Allen had time to show off his comic talent. In this role, he was just a distraction with a few jokes. One did not know what to think of him.I think that this was the whole problem with this movie. It never really stuck on a particular aspect of the plot long enough to gain the credibility of the audience. The movie was moving from one scene to the next with no congruity. While I understand that this was perhaps an intended part of the spoof, it didn't work for the viewer. So, I would say that this movie is still better than most of the bombs made this summer, but it is hardly a masterpiece.",Casino Royale
95,ragosaal,What a Waste !,4,9 December 2006,"Its hard to find out what were the producers tried to do here. Casino Royale"" is definitely not a James Bond film, its not either a parody of Bond films as you could call the Derek Flint or Matt Helm issues and if its a comedy it is not funny at all.The script is poor, the dialogues don't make any sense, the plot is a mess and as for comedy just a couple of smiles (in more than 2 hours run) with Woody Allen or perhaps Peter Sellers).The whole thing is impossible to defend, its a really bad film and a truly waste of a story and an all star cast with real big names. The sad thing is that as you watch ""Casino Royale"" you have the feeling that money was not a problem here, and a good film could have made with such budget.What a waste of everything!!!",Casino Royale
96,ThomasColquith,A Disjointed Mess,4,29 July 2021,"As a whole ""Casino Royale"" is a bad movie, it could easily be given a 1/10 rating. There is no plot, no coherence, no linear progression, scenes and storylines are cut abruptly, with characters disappearing for lengths of time, and speaking of length, this mess of a film is far too long. It is also not funny enough to be an effective spoof, and not serious enough to be a spy thriller; it is not sure what it is. So, why did I generously give this frenetic film a 4/10 rating? Basically because it did hold my attention for the whole film -- mainly because I was curious about how this odd film would progress and end. Thus, it was mildly entertaining and had some fashion and flair, but very little substance, even for a spoof. Furthermore, the male characters are all forgettable, annoying, and pointless. However, the female characters are the real reason to watch this film; they have some depth and are beautiful, interesting, colorful, and fashionable in a way that is not seen today. Ursula Andress especially is magnetic here in a way I did not see in ""Dr. No"". In summary, if you are interested in watching this film, go in with low expectations and you just might be entertained, but if you skip this one that is fine too.",Casino Royale

Too much money, too many directors, and too little sense of comprehension for a pretend Bond flick.  It's too bad Joanna Pettet was never in a good film.

This is hard to believe because some of the biggest names in the film industry are in this one.  The theme music ""Casino Royale"" is truly a wonderful instrumental and is still good when at the end of the film  ""words"" are actually added to it.

101,thehumanduvet,Great giggly nostalgia from stellar cast,8,12 October 2000,"I can't believe how many people have posted such negative comments about this film - those who try to compare it with the serious Bond series are as witless as those who find the plot too complicated for their tiny little minds. I saw this first when I was about 12 years old, and it seemed clear enough to me then - there are some baddies, and the goodies have to stop them. With some gags and lots of style. OK maybe with maturity I can see it has dated a little, some scenes may drag a bit and a few people may be offended by the sixties outlook on life, but hey whadda you expect from a sixties film? What it boils down to is a series of comic vignettes featuring just about every famous face in the movies at the time, bringing Sellers and Niven together again after the first Pink Panther movie, which practically founded the whole crazy sixties anything-goes genre, of which this is the pinnacle and epitome. Set to some fabulous tunes and on a collection of extraordinary sets, dozens of master mirthmakers perform a loopy little dance around the plot of Fleming's novel (this film actually contains a lot more of the novel it is named after than most of the ""proper"" Bond series). Some of the faces only feature for a few moments (Peter O'Toole's part is tiny, for one), others, like Sellers, Allen, Niven and Welles, do enough to create truly memorable characters despite the frantic pace of much of the film (I still cannot think of Welles' face without those scary shades).  Sellers does his multi-talented thing as usual, Niven plays Bond to a tee as the quintessential unflappable Englishman (his screen persona provided much of the inspiration when Fleming created Bond), and Allen plays his nervy, sexmad little stereotype as well as in any of his own films. I can see that this will not appeal to some people, but anyone who can lighten up, enjoy a little silliness and appreciate that 60s sense of humour will find this a hilarious jaunt round the spy genre. If you do like it, check the other installments in this classic period for Sellers - What's New Pussycat, After the Fox, the Wrong Box and of course, the awesome Magic Christian. Beats the pants off yer Austin Powers any day of the week.",Casino Royale

It's just going to confuse things.This is also what makes it good though.It's chaos, especially the creschendo end scene. You can't compare it to other bonds because it's a spoof. It's a break from the usual serious spy stuff. Some very funny, witty and silly moments.Fantastic score and music, especially the look of love.Very beautiful scantily clad women involved which always appeals to bond fans. Barbara Bouchet as Miss Moneypennys daughter is very stunning and very unlucky that she has to kiss a good few old men in the film. Ursula Andress makes another bond appearance and still looks at beautiful as ever five years on.

Multiple viewings are generally not my thing but for me this is fun, nostalgic, clever and a breath of fresh air. It had some of the biggest named stars of the era willingly poking fun at themselves. The sixties heralded some of the most outrageous fashions and cultural shifts and this movie typifies what it was like. Very colorful, pre-digital, personality driven and carefree. Since the 70's, most of this has been lost to the boring PC culture and the promise of a new technological prison, that has little time for the absurd. Long live Casino Royale.",Casino Royale
104,bergma15@msu.edu,"Not Bond, not funny",3,17 September 2007,"I saw this film first when they played it on some James Bond marathon when I was 10. I thought it was somewhat funny (I guess I was pretty easy to amuse as a child). A week ago it was on again, and I figured I'd give it another viewing. For me, it turned into one of those ""why did I like this?"" moments.To begin with, the idea of making a James Bond spoof in the late Sixties was not a bad one. Secondly, they had a great cast (David Niven, Peter Sellers, Ursula Andress, Orson Welles, Woody Allen, etc.). However, this movie just didn't come together. Maybe it is because the director's chair was the proverbial revolving door. Maybe it was because Sellers wanted to play the straight man and wasn't his zany self. Or maybe it is because the jokes were the usual schlock that one would expect from a low budget vaudeville comedy act. I think it was all of the above.Here's the plot kiddies. Sir James Bond (Niven) is summoned out of retirement to stop the killing of agents whose identities have been sold out. This ""Bond"" is the typical English Gentleman who shuns the excesses that we all know and love Fleming's James Bond for. His plan is to recruit spies and give them all the name James Bond and number 007 (this is where things get confusing and not very funny). Sellers plays a card pro who is recruited (yes they named him James Bond) to play against Le Chiffre (Welles) and bankrupt him thus exposing his embezzlement from SMERSH. Sellers is aided by Vesper Lynd (Andress). Also, there's Woody Allen (Jimmy Bond, Niven's nephew) who provides some yuks. There are also quite a few cameos from big name stars (John Huston, George Raft, William Holden, to name a few).The big joke in this thing (everyone being James Bond) really fell short of the funny mark. As a matter of fact, all the jokes land short of humor. I think this was the main failure of this movie. All in all it had a lot of potential, but just wasn't executed well.",Casino Royale

Woody Allen is hilarious in, I believe, his second film. The Orson Welles magic trick is fun to watch. Deborah Kerr does a very funny (and rare) comic turn . Also she looks fantastic. Ursula Andress , sexy as hell. Perhaps the one actor who is truly wasted is Peter Sellers as this is one of the few movies that he isn't funny in. Add to all this you have Bacharach's fantastic score and Dusty Springfield's smoldering version of Look of Love. It's no masterpiece but Casino Royale is a lot of fun.

The first two times I absolutely hated it and only rented it on DVD the third time because I had just read the original book by Ian Fleming and wanted to see what , if anything, was retained from the actual plot. The answer is nothing. Basically this is just a spoof made to cash in on the James Bond craze during  the sixties. It has a lot of silly sequences performed by some big stars who at least all seem to be having a good time. It's also the inspiration for the Austin Powers films so if you're an Austin Powers fan ( which I'm not) you might actually ""get""  this film. From what I understand they're going to remake it and once again all they're keeping is the title. Why that is  I have no idea.

108,DeanNYC,Too Serious For A Comedy; Too Weird For A Drama,5,21 July 2007,"It's kind of a shock that this film was made at all. Granted, the ""Bond Franchise"" wasn't quite what it is now, but to spoof the series of films using the 007 name and the title of one of Ian Fleming's great books seems unbelievable, looking back on it.But more surprising is this film itself. What is it, really? It claims to be a spoof, yet they do have a serious agenda. It has Orson Welles, David Niven, Peter Sellers, and Woody Allen, the last because of the super success of the ribald comedy ""What's New Pussycat."" And Ursula Andress, of ""Dr. No"" bikini fame turns up here too. The story of what happened during the making of this film could have been a film itself, with the fighting, the posturing, the directors quitting... And that explains how and why the finished product appears to be a patchwork of different scenes, simply strung together. That's what it became because of the off camera antics of the people involved.This movie is actually pretty interesting visually, with each individual scene being watchable, but the problem is it doesn't fit together in any cohesive manner, though the soundtrack provided by Burt Bacharach definitely helps hold what little it can in place.Perhaps this might be more entertaining if you had a tab of acid right before viewing it (not my idea, there is a reference to LSD towards the climax of the film)! But if you're not into that, just try to appreciate each moment and not attempt to connect the dots and you might get some enjoyment out of it.",Casino Royale

Sure I liked Woody Allen as Jimmy Bond and I give props to Orson Wells playing a very useless villain but the film is flat and dull. I so wanted to enjoy this movie, I mean it had a fine cast. We even have Ursula Andress who played Honey Rider in the first Bond movie! But you get easily confused on who is the bad guy, who is the villain girl, who is the real Bond with three people running around with guns saying they are Agent 007. Pointless movie, sure I liked the last half hour but it was very predictable and stupid with a bar fight and the cowboys arriving with jet packs and a bomb inside Dr. Noah,oh Lord. Sure a few lines of cute dialog heck, a few good lines of funny dialog! "" Please help me this gun shoots backwards. I just killed myself help!"" But this film is too boring to understand that a few funny lines of dialog won't save it. So I give this film the big 3, a total bore fest that is too stuck up and stupid.

He explained the background, and why this film turned out the way it did. The producers couldn't use Flemings book, because parts had been used in all the other serious Bond flicks and all that was left was the Casino, Baccarat game, and Vespers' treachery - everything else was created for this film. Four directors were hired to each do a segment, but they were hired by a time limit, not project, so many segments overlapped in filming, and were left unfinished by the directors, including John Huston's segment. On top of this, Peter Sellers and Orson Welles HATED each other, and Sellers pulled a 'I'm too sick to come in and I have a doctor's note"" routine, so he was fired. In the end, there were unfinished shoots and incomplete parts, so Val Guest was hired to cobble everything together and create a thread of a plot line to unify the film and make some sense. Guest added a couple of scenes with the help of David Niven, Deborah Kerr, and Bill Holden, and did the best he could to salvage this dog's breakfast of a film. Despite the problems, parts are greater than the whole of this film and some scenes are truly funny, others are campy, and many are sharp spoofs of 60s Bond films - The German school of spying is great, as is any scene with Woody Allen, and all of the bond girls in their over- the-top outfits are entertaining.So, if you think this film looks like it was shot on acid, there is a reason!",Casino Royale

112,elisereid-29666,8 stars for the Sellers scenes and the ending-4 for the rest of the movie,6,26 January 2020,"Casino Royale, as it stands, is an indulgent mess, but there are a few great bits and pieces that show us how it might've been had it been carried through as originally intended.Of course, the biggest problem is that Peter Sellers, the star of the film, was either fired or walked at some point during the production, leading the filmmakers to re-imagine the concept to incorporate as much of his footage as possible while still having a releasable movie.Almost releasable, the final product is. To begin with, the first 45 minutes of the film (Sellers isn't properly introduced till the 45 minute mark) could have been condensed down to 10-15 minutes and still convey the necessary information, and the film would have been much stronger if they had done so.Sellers was allegedly disappointed that he wasn't playing Bond ""straight"", a la Sean Connery, and thus gives almost a completely straight performance, which is unusual for him. Still the idea of him as an ""everyman"" who gets thrust into the world of spies make his scenes entertaining, and he-believe it or not!-has marvelous chemistry with Ursula Andress. He has negative chemistry with co-star Orson Welles. Welles and Sellers didn't get along on the set, and it shows in every frame of their scenes, where Sellers displays open contempt for Welles, which is appropriate for both of their characters.After the Sellers footage runs out, the film goes back to the tedium of the opening scenes until the finale...which is incredible, indescribable. You really need to see it to believe it, and it makes sitting through the non-interesting parts of the film totally worth it.The film, as it stands, is overlong and had it been edited more judiciously, it might have been a welcome addition to the spy parody genre (the ""straight"" Bond films always struck me as parodies themselves, but I seem to be alone on this one). But it's still worth seeing for the nice moments, but expect to fall asleep or be stunned into submission for the less-nice moments.",Casino Royale

For the most part, it's a plotless, convoluted mess that lost a kazillion dollars at the box office.  If ""Laugh-In's"" Rowan & Martin were given an unlimited budget and told to throw together a bunch of weird sketches that had nothing to do with each other, add some music, and given nothing but the words ""offbeat"" and ""James Bond"", I think it would come off looking something like this.Producer Charles Feldman had the rights to Ian Fleming's spy novel ""Casino Royale"" (Albert Broccoli had obtained the rights to all the others in the series).  Movielore has it that Broccoli wouldn't lend out Sean Connery to do ""Casino Royale,"" so Feldman decided instead to rewrite the script as a silly, all-out parody.  Well, after a circus line-up of no less than five directors (including John Huston), three scripters (not including ghostwriters Woody Allen, Peter Sellers, Billy Wilder, Terry Southern and Ben Hecht(!)), an enormously eclectic cast, and swarms of unbilled star cameos, this is the elephant they hatched.David Niven (who, by the way, was Fleming's ""personal"" choice to play ""007"" in the popular film series) plays an aging Sir James Bond who reluctantly comes out of retirement to do battle with his old nemesis, the syndicate SMERSH (they should have called it CHAOS), after international spies are being knocked off left and right.  That's about all I could make of it. The rest is a blur.  The story, and I use that VERY loosely, sorta gets in the way after awhile.  The sum of its parts are definitely better than the whole.""Casino Royale"" is, most importantly, a feast for the eyes.  The treat is in its superb visuals and art design, with eye-popping, hallucinogenic effects that were state-of-the-art at the time.  The shockingly vibrant, Peter Max-inspired sets and Twiggy-cut costumes add immeasurably to the film's kitsch factor.  The enormously catchy title tune included in the opening/closing credits, and Bacharach's original music throughout are also a  plus factor.  You can't ignore the expense, resources, and mind-blowing imagination that went into this wild roller-coaster ride.
Favorite parts: Joanna Pettet's lush, exotic dance as Mata Bond (I dare you to guess who her famous parents are); Orson Welles' feats of magic at the baccarat table; Peter Sellers and the scintillating Ursula Andrews cavorting slow-motion to Dusty Springfield's smoky version of ""The Look of Love""; Woody Allen's unveiling as Dr. Noah; Sellers' drugged-induced, psychedelic nightmare sequence, and, of course, all the expected ka-booms and gadget-filled chase sequences betwixt and between.Cast-wise, ""Casino Royale"" is a humdinger.  You've got David Niven, Peter Sellers, Deborah Kerr and Orson Welles to give it ersatz class; you've got William Holden, Jean-Paul Belmondo, George Raft and Peter O'Toole in gag cameos to give it a ""hip"" happening kind of thing;  and you've got the afore-mentioned Andress and Bouchet, in addition to Daliah Lavi, Barbara Bouchet (as Moneypenny), and the ever-tasty Jackie Bisset (as Miss Goodthighs) as mini-skirted Bondian eye candy.As for the rambling, uninspired, highly explosive wrap-up: well, let's just say the insanity includes the cavalry, fighting seals, the CIA, go-go dancing Indians, a hiccuping Woody Allen, and more James Bonds running around than you can shake a stick with, and leave it at that.  It makes about as much sense as the rest of it.  It's too farcical even to be considered a farce!So, don't try to make heads or tails of it; you'll give yourself a headache. Just relax and enjoy a phantasmagorical experience if ever there was one. It really kinda grows on you after a few attempts.",Casino Royale
114,zensixties,Excellent Psychodelic '60s Magic; Was everyone in this film on Acid?!!,10,10 August 2000,"As a '60s afficionado I finally got around to seeing this great psychodelic mindblower of a film.  It starts off slow....enter Ursula Andress, rreeooww, baby.  Behave!   There are at least 100 beautiful European girls in this film and I can see Woody Allen's motivation to kill all men taller than him so he can get them all.  As the film takes off you realize that you have to be on Acid to understand the plot, as everyone remotely connected with this film must've been.  The sets range from a Scottish castle to a Berlin haunted house to Orson Wells' psychodelic torture chamber, and it gets more bizarre from there.  Great music by Burt Bacharach (The Look of Love).This film is Austin Powers ultimate wet dream as it's ACTUALLY in 1967, has every famous star in England just about, has a Spaceship full of Woody's duplicate World Leaders...it has everything, mod spiral funhouse rooms used as sets.  What can I say, if you dig the '60s you'll dig this.  Just for the record I've never personally done Acid, but I still have Psychodelic Consciousness which you need to appreciate this.",Casino Royale
115,ginger_sonny,Some films just shouldn't have been made,3,3 August 2004,"Chaotic and astonishingly unfunny Bond spoof that pre-empts Austin Powers in all but its humour bypass. David Niven, Orson Welles, Deborah Kerr, Peter Sellars and Ursula Andress are among the stars who should have had serious words with their agents. Some films just shouldn't have been made - and this 'comedy' is one of them. It has a starry cast that includes top-flight comedians and distinguished dramatic actors, yet the whole thing just turns into a sorry mess.Niven is an elderly James Bond called out of retirement to take on the evil SMERSH. Soon after the film begins, any sense of plot development is subsumed into the chaos of British agents all named James Bond 007, extravagant sets and innumerable pert starlets. The hodgepodge of wretched spoofery and unfunny skits manages to cast a pall over the reputations of Welles, Kerr, Allen, Sellers, Belmondo, O'Toole, and anyone else foolish enough to have appeared in front of the cameras.The producers brought in writer after writer (including an uncredited Terry Southern) to attempt to give the movie some form, but the five directors who are credited evidently simply couldn't find any direction to take it.One interesting factor is how Austin Powers it all looks now. One sequence involving Sellers' Evelyn Tremble dressing up for Andress' Vesper Lynn looks almost indistinguishable from the Mike Myers films.",Casino Royale
116,tsf-1962,premium Bond,9,22 December 2006,"I've always had a soft spot for this movie. Sure, it goes on for too long and most of the gags run out of steam, but for the most part it's laugh-out loud funny. It was shamelessly ripped off by ""Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery,"" which is a shorter and more coherent film. The images from ""Casino Royale"" that stick in my mind are Orson Welles doing magic tricks and Woody Allen in a kinky bondage scene with the lovely Israeli actress Dahlia Lavi. This film sports a virtual who's who of gorgeous sixties starlets: Lavi, Barbara Bouchet, Joanna Pettet, Ursula Andress, Jacqueline Bissett. The all-star cast is a fascinating blend of Hollywood veterans, newcomers, and hopefuls, many of whom peaked with this film. David Niven's James Bond is the perfect unflappable Englishman, and Peter Sellars is baccarat expert Evelyn Trimble. Of the ladies Joanna Pettet gives the finest performance as Bond and Mata Hari's love child. The ultra-cool Burt Bacharach score and Dusty Springfield singing ""The Look of Love"" alone are worth the price of admission, and it's great to hear Niven tell a pompous Soviet bureaucrat ""I knew your man Lenin. A first-rate organizer with a second-rate mind."" As a bonus feature the DVD includes the 1955 TV play ""Casino Royale,"" the first time any 007 story had been dramatized. It's pretty dreary stuff, but worth watching for the always interesting Peter Lorre as the villain Le Chiffre (a role Orson Welles was to reinvent for the film).",Casino Royale
117,dwankan,Too Dated,4,5 August 2017,"I remember loving this film years ago. Unfortunately, it has not aged well. The humor does not work. Aside from a few near misses, the jokes rely on blindingly obvious innuendo and over-padded wackiness (with Benny Hill style musical accompaniment, which gets annoying very, very fast). The women in the story are sex objects to the extreme. The script makes the sexploitation flicks of the early 70s look feministic. Most of the female ""actors"" were worse than amateur, but they were pretty, and each of their characters was in desperate search of a man to use them sexually. This hit a low when Bond's daughter implied an attraction to her father. Disgusting. Peter Sellers, once considered a genius, is more difficult to stomach every time I see him. The sound of his voice and his high-toned-grease accent are like nails on a chalkboard. I think what makes him even harder to take in this is that he was trying to play his part seriously (no kidding, folks: he wanted this to be an action flick, starring himself). The cinematography looks like it was done by a rich film student: very slick but laughably overdone. One scene cuts back and forth between Ursula Andress and Peter Sellers during a conversation, but the shots of Sellers show him speaking while sitting down, and the shots of Andress are slow motion shots of her doing awkward contortions while speaking. The effect is to make the scene look like the wrong shots of her were intercut with the right shots of Sellers. I gave it about 45 minutes before I realized I was laughing out of sympathy for the embarrassingly bad humor, and that the only reason to keep watching was the futile hope I might catch a flash of skin from one of the brainless bimbos that constantly flitted around the background in skimpy outfits or obscured partial nudity.",Casino Royale
118,brailsford,It gets better each time I watch it.,10,7 April 2010,"I'll be honest, the first time I watched it was for a truly bizarre reason (I heard a rumor the song ""The happening"" by Diana Ross and the supremes was played somewhere in the film, I watched it the first 2 times looking for this song) But then I grew an appreciation for the film, it is truly brilliant satire performed by an all star cast, in a lot of ways I like it better then the Daniel Craig Verison. Given the title is kind of deceptive as Casino Royale as the novel is only a portion of what this film covers. Both Peter Sellers and David Niven both deliver as bond (Peter Sellers as the bond based on the one in the book, albeit it a little less tough and a lot more silly). Sellers played well off of Welles and there exchange was memorable. The film was a tad hard to follow, but after you watch it about the third time it does actually make sense, yes it's weird at times, with such events as bond being chased by an exploding milk truck, a guy on horse kidnapping Bond's daughter and escaping in a flying saucer, Bond asking Frankenstien's monster for directions, LeCheife mentally raping Evelyn Tremble, a final fight scene which looked like something out of a 60's variety show, and some very impressive and tripy sets props. I won't recommend this film to people looking for a serious Bond movie, but for people who appreciate Niven, Sellers and some of the other greats in this film, this is a good film.",Casino Royale

There was a couple of times where Peter Sellers got serious and I actually thought he was Sean Connery for a moment. What nice touch to put Woody Allen in a role that fit him perfectly. All the women were ""dead on"" the type of women in the other Bond movies. The end really got bizarre with a ""cowboys and Indians"" scene and they even had the Keystone Cops in one of the scenes!

Meant to be a spy movie spoof/""sex romp"" spoof: it's full of attempts at non sequitur humor, most of it quaint sexual innuendo -- basically Bennie Hill, without the subtlety. Armies of glamorous young women signalling constant availability to older, paunchy guys. The swinging 60s music works hard to tell us where to laugh. So many late 1960s ""comedies"" appear to have been made after use of weed and LSD became de rigueur among the creative classes -- bits that cracked up writers and directors under the influence then are ponderous and inexplicable to us today. The film's main value is as an artifact of its era (see SKIDOO and MYRA BRECKENRIDGE). The first 35 minutes or so with David Niven falls flat and makes no sense -- best skip to the parts with Woody Allen and Peter Sellers. Really expensive studio production, back when they had to build real sets. Might be useful projected on a wall at a party, without sound, in the background . . .",Casino Royale

I tried watching it on Netflix a couple weeks ago, hoping that I had just been in a bad mood the first time. I bailed after 15 minutes. There is nothing good to be said about this film. It was a mess in 1967 and it hasn't improved with age. I don't watch movies for any other reason than to be entertained, and to say that there was anything entertaining about this movie would be a bold faced lie. I'll leave the sophisticated analysis to the experts. My simplistic opinion rates it at less than junk. Unless you've got 15 minutes to waste, let this one pass.

Deathray"" and ""Operation Double 007,"" best endured in their MST3K incarnations).While this movie is all over the place and hard to defend, it does at least offer: some pretty hilarious sketches (all the David Niven/Deborah Kerr stuff, Peter Seller's obvious unease around Orson Welles, Joanna Pettet in East Berlin), some gorgeous 60's babes whose screen careers never quite panned out (Pettet, Daliah Lavi, Barbara Bouchet) and a simply extraordinary Burt Bacharach score.You need to be in a somewhat indulgent mood for this one (and try to see it letterboxed on disc or DVD), but it's a movie that always makes me smile (I'm more inclined to watch it again than any of the ""real"" Bond movies) and always a pure romp.Viva ""Casino Royale""!

Some comment that the movie does not always make sense. That is the point. It is not supposed to make much sense. It is very similar to ""What's new Pussycat."" The two movies share the same producer as well as Peter Seller, Woody Allen, Peter O'Toole and lots of beautiful women. This movie was made at a time when the world was not making much sense, and this movie reflects that. This was a major studio release that used the psycadelic style of the era. This is a movie of the Mad Men era. The plot surrounds James Bond being pulled out of retirement to find out who is killing the world's spies. His first three decisions are to change every spies name and number to James Bond 007, to have a spy who all women want that does not want women, and to hire the illegitimate daughter he had with Mata Hari. Nobody is supposed to take this plot seriously. Like other 60's movies, you are supposed to sit back and enjoy the ride. It is well worth seeing. The music is great. Particularly Dusty Springfield's rendition of Burt Bacharach and Hal David's The Look of Love. There are great cameos. Peter O'Toole, George Raft, and Jacqueline Bisset appear.

A Bond film not in the Broccoli Bond franchise due to copyright ownership of Casino Royale which is as we know became a quite brilliant movie when they had the rights in 2006. In a way this was an open goal for the owners of copyright of Casino Royale to just make a movie of the book with a different Bond actor. A ka-ching moment. Get it right you are sitting on a golden egg. Get it wrong? Still interest in it and make money. What exactly happened is debated. To length. Hard to follow. The film itself is as you probably know is directed by..directors. There is an incredibly large amount of talent in this film. It still confuses me they knew they had made an increasingly large incomrehensible piece of film and just thought eff it keep going.When I watched it as a young man I found it hilarious. The Bacharach involvement is mesmerises me. There is a possible thought in my mind that without Bacharach the film would be erased from my mind.Of course as the film progresses you think there should be more use if David Niven, Woody Allen, Orson Wells and much more of Peter Sellers and certainly much more of Peter O'Toole who's scene still makes me laugh.When the shooting of a film becomes a disaster and then released a bomb. Sometimes you see a masterpiece which was understood and a better film than was given credit for. Sometimes a directors cut reveal a film that should have been great but badly received. A directors cut of this film would be impossible. Which one would you ask?What caused me to write a review about a film that was made before I was born was a friend in work. He didn't find the Austin Powers movies in anyway amusing which confused me. I think they are all very amusing. And he is a very intelligent scientist.Then one Sunday afternoon on TV he watched this 1967 Casino Royale partially because I told him he would enjoy it. He watched it and had an ephany moment. He found Austin Powers humour he missed in the first veiwing. He watched them all again and loved them. Because of Peter Sellers? David Niven?.Both?The only thing about this film is Peter Sellers WANTED to be BOND. You can see it when he is playing Baccarat. Yes I have no idea about how the card game is played. But you can see Bond in Peter Sellers eyes. It may have worked for him to be Bond...?.
We are never to know! But interesting..

127,Sentinel-15,A misunderstood masterpiece,8,27 December 2001,"Casino Royale is kind of an oddball movie  although perhaps the synonym `eccentric' might describe it better. This movie goes way beyond mere Bond `parody' (as if the bond film ever *needed* parodying). Instead, this is camp at its very best, with a firmly tongue-in-cheek sense of humour.
Complaining about a muddled plot, as seems to be common, also seems a lot like `missing the point'. The movie, plot included, can only be described as surreal  it doesn't make any sense, and I just LOVE it - with lots of wonderfully outlandish sets (& situations) to match. Don't try to make sense of it, and enjoy it for what it actually *is*.
The movie has a great international cast, with lots of big names from times gone by. Also, the musical score by Burt Bacharach is excellent.They don't make films like this anymore  and that is a bad thing. The `Austin Powers' movies were a good attempt, though (if you can forgive the toilet humour). A nice touch in these movies was the inclusion of composer Burt Bacharach himself. `The Look of Love', a great song and musical theme from `Casino Royale', was also used in the 1st Austin Powers movie.",Casino Royale
128,d_nuttle,Bizarre mix,6,23 April 2007,"This is part movie, part variety/comedy sketch show. The gags are all over the road, some funny, many falling flat on their faces. The Herb Alpert soundtrack sounds terribly dated, and the main theme becomes headache-inducing. Woody Allen is featured as a star but has the tiniest of cameo roles. But then William Holden's cameo is even smaller, and entirely pointless. The bit about John Huston flipping his wig was pretty funny.The movie has its moments but seems almost perversely determined to keep reminding you that it's a loose collection of skits and gags. The funniest part of the movie is the first part (""doodle me, James!""); a fair amount of boredom after that. Peter Sellers, so brilliant in ""Dr. Strangelove"" just a few years before, is flat and uninspired. Plenty of women to ogle, but that's hardly a cinematic achievement.A bizarre time capsule from the 1960's, something like ""The Magic Christian."" If you're not a cultural anthropologist or a fan of the absurd, it would be best to avoid. Bond buffs looking for a genuine parody will be disappointed.",Casino Royale
129,mikeburdick,An interesting experiment,7,24 November 2013,"The Sixties was all about experimentation, and often, films that broke the traditional storytelling mould became highly influential, some of them new classics, such as Lester's ""Hard Day's Night"", Schlesinger's ""Billy Liar"" and Fellini's ""8½"". Of course, sometimes those that took bold risks didn't entirely succeed. ""Casino Royale"" is certainly the biggest film in this category. Many of the reviews of ""Casino Royale"" refer to it as an unholy mess or something of the sort, and it's hard to debate this assessment, particularly when you consider its troubled production. With a dozen writers, half a dozen directors, and main cast members walking off the production, there's bound to be problems. Yet, there's a lot to love about this film:The sheer magnitude of cast assembled. From George Raft, Peter O'Toole and Orson Welles to Woody Allen, Peter Sellers and Ronnie Corbett to Jean-Paul Belmondo, Deborah Kerr, and a young Jacqueline Bisset, it's a who's who of awesome people. Sure, many of them are cameos, but that adds to the fun. The shagadelic sixties. From the Burt Bacharach soundtrack and futuristic Mod sets to the go-go skirts and spinning beds, there's no question that Mike Myers found a treasure trove of inspiration for Austin Powers in this film.The absolute lunacy. This might well be the first mashup in film history, jumping from spy parody to German Expressionism to Keystone Cops to psychedelic trip. Why not toss in Frankenstein, flying saucers and cowboys and Indians, for good measure?The shortcomings and failures are quite obvious: The script is incredibly muddled, probably due to multiple big-gun writers evolving a script that had to drastically change to accommodate the comings and goings of the various star power. Much of the humour falls flat, depending on who's directing. John Huston was a great director, but not of comedies. Compare his segment in the beginning to the hilarious climactic end sequence. Frankly, had Blake Edwards directed the entire thing, it would have turned out much funnier. Ultimately, ""Casino Royale"" is flawed and overindulgent—perhaps even an unholy mess—but that's sort of what makes it worth watching. It's a unique film of a unique period with a unique set of circumstances that made something like this possible only once.",Casino Royale

Burt Bacharach's score is unforgettable.Sadly, I did find two things not to like.  The ""fight in the casino"" ending was action-filled, but ridiculous and unfunny.  And sadly, David Niven only walks through his part providing little feeling and mostly no effort.  And since Niven is on the screen for a majority of the film, it did hurt.All in all this movie reminds me a great deal of Steven Spielberg's comedy 1941.  Lots of stars, lots of action, and so many jokes that they fly fast and furiously.  So much so that viewers miss an abundance of them.",Casino Royale
131,mbruce007,James Bond on acid...,5,2 October 2020,"As a fan of pure Bond, that is to say the ""official"" Bond film series under the direction of the Broccoli family, this is a film I usually would mention in hushed tones. Casino Royale (1967) is a rogue production, and, as a result, it fails to be taken seriously as true ""Bond"" matter. Produced by Charles K. Feldman, and directed by Val Guest, this is a film which features a top-billed cast, with names such as David Niven, Peter Sellers, William Holden, Orson Welles, and Woody Allen, to name but a few. It's therefore all the more disappointing that this film was a critical flop.The film sees our protagonist, ""Sir"" James Bond (played by David Niven) called out of retirement after the death of M, in order to stop the criminal organisation, SMERSH, and its big noise, ""Le Chiffre"" (played, bizarrely, by Orson Welles). The decision is made that, in order to stop SMERSH, every agent in the field should be called James Bond, in order to confuse, and, finally, thwart the enemy. One of the ""Bond"" recruits is Evelyn Tremble (played tactfully by Peter Sellers) who goes against Le Chiffre in a high-stakes baccarat game at Casino Royale. However, all does not go to plan, and everything reaches a messy and unforeseen conclusion.Famously, the film's production was taxing and tempers were considerably frayed, to the extent that the film was passed on to several directors throughout the course of filming. The film sells itself as a ""spy comedy"" or ""spy spoof"". It certainly is that, but, sadly, the comedy is expendable. I originally thought that, being part of a modern film-going generation, I would be forgiven for not being able to understand some of the humour of that period. But it is safe to say, after several viewings, that some of it, unintentionally, is just not funny.Not only is this film a marketed parody of 007, it also seems to be a parody of itself, giving more of an insight into the temperamental production than you would believe. With perhaps the exception of Sellers, none of the classic actors are on top form, clearly doing this film out of loyalty to money, rather than a good script. Perhaps the only element of the film that stands up (and, it certainly isn't the cinematography) is the music by Burt Bacharach. Aided by the input of Herp Albert and the Tijuana Brass, this is a brassy, jazzy soundtrack that is not Bondian at all, and would have made John Barry weep, but it is, nonetheless, memorable. Let's not forget that the Academy Award for Best Original song that year was given to Dusty Springfield's song, ""The Look of Love"" on the soundtrack.If you're a British cultural historian of the 60s, this film is interesting to watch, but if you're an average film buff, don't raise your hopes for entertainment too high.",Casino Royale

It's obvious that Austin Powers was inspired by this film. The music is cool, the women are gorgeous (Lavi, Bastedo, et al.), the sets are outstanding and the humor is bizarre (""first John I've ever gone 'round with....).

If you endure this, it's getting better - not plot-wise, but there is a nice handful of insanely funny ideas. All loosely put together; I suppose having five directors hasn't helped much - still, it can be quite amusing, especially if you are slightly intoxicated.Yes, this is a film for drunken people. Made by drunken people as well, one could think. The good actors are wasted.

It seemed to be the film everyone who was someone wanted to be seen in. Now everone who was in it wants to forget about it. I found it a test of my patience and perseverance to watch it to the end.

There is a great bit of difference between Dr. No and Skyfall. To say the least. However I decided to watch this ""not genuine"" Bond film to make sure I hadn't missed anything. Now I wish I had given this a miss. This film is an absolute disaster of a Bond film. David Niven is a wonderful gentleman and actor, but here the manuscript makes him a downright clown. Bond is not cool in any way in this film. He is a modest and easily surprised farcical character. The lines may have worked in the 60s, but in 2016, they are downright ridiculous. The special effects and stunts are non- existent - that is to say that even though they were limited in the 60s, the other Bond films from that decade show us that it can be done SO much better. The plot is a joke - at no point during this turd of a film did I feel the least bit excited or interested in what was happening next. They even (almost) manage to make the absolutely brilliant Peter Sellers appear indifferent and sad. Almost! Every other character in the film are downright unconvincing, regardless of how good an actor/actress they chose for the part. Don't waste two hours of your life on this. It is dire!",Casino Royale
136,A_Friend_of_Sarah_Connor,A jaw-dropping disaster (SPOILERS),1,2 November 2007,"Before getting to the actual review of the film, a word of warning: 1967's ""Casino Royale"" has nothing to do with the superior 2006 adaptation of Ian Fleming's first James Bond novel. In fact, it's not part of Eon Productions ""official"" series of films because it was made without any input from the producers at the time, Albert R. Broccoli and Harry Salzman. Unfortunately, that's not the only reason that it's largely been forgotten by mainstream audiences; it probably has more to do with the fact that the film (a term I use very loosely because the plot is so episodic) is almost unwatchable.When asked to name a spy spoof, most people usually think of Mike Myers' ""Austin Powers"" series or ""Die Another Day"" (sorry, turns out that's an ""official"" entry in the Bond franchise). But predating Mr. Myers' and his ""unnecessarily slow-moving dipping mechanisms"" was this movie, produced by Charles K. Feldman and directed by no less than 5 people (that right there should be an indicator of the movie's quality). Since Feldman had little to no chance against the official series if he was to make a ""straight"" adaptation of the 1953 book, he decided to produce a film that was the exact opposite: a spoof that parodied the exaggerated ridiculousness of the Bond films. I can appreciate this--I enjoy the ""Austin Powers"" movies because they're clever and sometimes hysterical. The problem with ""Casino Royale"" isn't just that it's not in the least coherent, but that it's just not funny.Surprisingly, the first ten minutes of exposition sets up a good situation. The real Sir James Bond (David Niven) is enjoying his retirement from the Secret Service when agents all over the world start dying. M (or McTarry, who knows?), played by John Huston, calls on Bond to find out what's going on. He refuses, and for some reason, his mansion is blown to smithereens and I believe M dies (since he's absent for the rest of the movie and I read somewhere that he does. I obviously couldn't have gotten this while watching the movie, but maybe I just wasn't paying attention). The remainder of the movie easily explains why marijuana is recommended while viewing, with scenes making little sense and everyone being codenamed 'James Bond' by the end.Most of the film plays out like an extended, recent episode of ""Saturday Night Live"". The scenes in the McTarry Mansion are especially dreadful and tiresome, adding nothing to the plot except 15 minutes of unfunny padding, while the Casino Royale, which is where the movie gets it's title from, is shoehorned into the script and only seems like an excuse to have Orson Welles show up and play Le Chiffre in a less than interesting gambling scene. But nothing compares to one of the most bizarre and ludicrous endings I've ever seen. And you've guessed it, it's painfully unfunny and cringe-inducing.Believe it or not, buried within this mess are three things that save the movie from getting a big fat zero. Half a star goes to the musical score by Burt Bacharach, which is a breezy soundtrack that fits the sporadic nature of what's unfolding on screen. The other half goes to the amazing cast, which includes Niven, Welles, Huston, Peter Sellers, George Raft, Jacqueline Bisset, Deborah Kerr, Woody Allen, a cameo by Peter O'Toole and (according to IMDb) an appearance by the then unknown David Prowse. On top of that, there's apparently 7 actors that could be found in an official Bond movie: Ursula Andress, Angela Scoular, Vladek Sheybal, John Hollis, Burt Kwouk, Caroline Munro, and Milton Reid. So it's too bad that everyone, especially Allen, seems to be doing what ever they want. Finally, the auction scenes are the best in the movie, not that they follow any logical narrative, but because they offered the only chuckles during the entire running time, which is 130 minutes too long. The only other times that I was laughing was at the ineptness of every other production value.With a small army of writers and directors, it's hardly a surprise that the plot (or plots) is/are uneven, characters switch sides without reason, and every joke/gag falls flat on it's face because of poor timing. The point of a comedy is to make us laugh, which is what something like the ""Scary Movie"" films succeed in. I bring them up because while they have the same scatter-brained humor of ""Casino Royale"", at least you can actually follow what's going on! The troubles that plagued the production, including Peter Sellers being fired before he finished shooting and the budget going way out of control, prove how durable the Bond series is, because ""Casino Royale"" still managed to rake in some money. Just goes to show how such a misfire like this, along with every criminal mastermind, cannot kill our favorite spy. 1/10",Casino Royale

The scenes are so incredibly ridiculous that you wonder what planet the insane mind that concieved them came from. It's great. Everything from the earlier Bond films is shredded. There is so much to look at in this, the bond girls, Peter Sellers, Orson Welles (somehow his bewildered brilliance never gets boring), the incredible sets, the colour!!! (you though Austin Powers was colourful??? forget it, the phycadelic scenes the bond girls. It all adds up to a mind trip well worth seeing.",Casino Royale
138,nhpbob,Just saw this in a theater,8,4 February 2003,"As a longtime admirer of this sloppy-yet-lovable film, I just HAD to go to a one-day only reissue, shown with ""What's New, Pussycat?"", during a Peter Sellers retrospective at New York's Film Forum theater today.    Having not seen this film in a long time, I was delighted to see the film work its magic on a packed movie house, though no doubt many of those people were probably fans of the film all along.   Actor Paul Giamatti sat right in front of me, direct from his triumph at Sundance with the upcoming ""American Splendor"", and he was giggling away like the rest of us.  (And the film-savvy Film Forum audience immediately laughed at the German Expressionist sets of the Berlin section of the film, well aware that the set designer(s) were paying homage to ""Cabinet of Dr. Caligari"".)This was an absolutely BEAUTIFUL print, with some reels of the film in breathtaking color, seemingly as fresh as it must have been in 1967. (Particularly the Mata Bond dance in India.   My god, those REDS....)  On a big screen, the Scottish castle scenes were oh-so-lush, and the slow-motion Ursula Andress moments during ""The Look Of Love"" had us all in its thrall. You gotta love a film that has so many inventive highlights, though structurally, after a good first hour, it soon loses its way.  (I want a behind-the-scenes documentary on this film NOW, not just a commentary on DVD.   You just know there's a lot of deleted scenes around somewhere...)And even though the film implodes into absolute ridiculousness in its final half hour, a lot of the film holds up well as a decent comedy.  Maybe this is in contrast to just watching ""What's New, Pussycat?"", which to me is a lamer comedy.   That film has its pluses, and it holds together decently as a story, but ""Casino Royale"" has much better laughs.   Previous writers here on IMDB have pointed out the highlights, so I won't bother here.And naturally, the music still sounds great.  Next time, I'd love to see this print reissued in a Digital Stereo print if possible, and coming out over big speakers in a larger theater.   After years on TV, this screening was revelatory.Speaking of the music: having met Burt Bacharach in LA in the early 90s, I remarked to him then how much I love the then out-of-print soundtrack of the film.   He took my address...and a week later, a home-made cassette of the soundtrack came to my then-LA home, with the sound of the needle going onto the vinyl!!!   Sadly, that tape is lost...but I'm glad to have the CD, which when it came out, I told him about, and Burt said he was stopping at the local Tower Records in Marina del Rey to pick that up himself!   How important was that to me?  Let's just say the theme song to this film is one of my favorite pieces of music...EVER!  A pick-me-up if there ever was one.Lastly, what a great assortment of women in this film.   But the best one? My god...Barbara Bouchet...........!",Casino Royale
139,mateusolivotti,Cassino Royale (1967),5,19 November 2020,"Casino Royale is the strangest and most different film from James Bond, but is that a good thing or a bad thing?The film tells the story of a criminal organization known as Smersh that is wiping out agents from all spy agencies in the world. Away from the British Secret Service, Bond returns to active duty, working out a secret conspiracy to fight the enemy.Firstly, the film is confusing, in the final stretch there are three twists and turns out of nowhere and completely meaningless, the characters change sides, feelings and character too quickly. Still in the final stretch, the identity of the villain is revealed, and as much as it is ""cute"" the revelation is very poorly constructed and meaningless, I am a fan of Woody Allen, however, he appears only in an initial scene and then just right at the end of the film, I really missed Allen in the feature. The film has too many plots, I think it has at least four, and if the film had more time (to work the plots better) or less time (to cut discard some plot) it would be much better. The film is a satire and has a ""slapstick"" humor, which works sometimes, but at other times the jokes are not funny at all and to finish the film it has a strong cast, but a large part of the talent of the wasted actors.Even with all these negative points the film is not so bad, the production design is great, really impressive, you can see that it was an expensive film and all the scenarios are very well worked and are really incredible (especially the psychedelic scenarios of the act Final). The end of the third act is very fun, funny and well choreographed, in this part the film becomes a complete and meaningless bullshit, but I liked that, and it is one of the funniest parts of the film.Casino Royale is a very average film, it undoubtedly has more mistakes than hits, but part of it is compensated with really impressive scenarios and the end of the film, which can be unusual, funny and unpredictable.
I recommend this film for anyone who is really a fan of the James Bond films, just to know and draw their own conclusions from this unknown film that eventually became cult, for those who no longer like the films of the 007 saga will hate the film.",Casino Royale
140,ouija-3,"Campy, colourful fun.",5,6 February 2001,"Casino Royale is a magnificent demonstration of what the late-and mid-sixties was all about. This insane carousel of events and characters does not seem to have a script according to which to work (which was pretty much what happened with the film's bloated budget and troubled production).
David Niven plays his character in his usual suave manner, while Peter Sellers is playing his part almost straight, which is a bit pity since the rest of the film so wildly irrational. There's also a large number of stars in often regretfully small roles, and a few unknowns, who should have become bigger stars (Barbara Bouchet, for instance). The cinematography is 1960's gorgeous and glossy and the sets are accordingly meticulous, generally speaking. Burt Bacharach's score is delightfully cheesy and suits the mood of the film perfectly. The song 'The Look of Love' is great as well.
I feel slightly ashamed of giving a positive review of this film, because it is known that the mish-mash end result was not wholly intentional, but was born out of desperation to complete the film somehow. There are stories of last-minute rewrites, changes in the whole general direction of the film, Sellers not turning up on the set and refusing to work with Welles, whom he saw as giving off ""bad vibes"", etc. Nonetheless, Casino Royale is a very enjoyable leftover from the sixties and is miles ahead recent Austin Powers films in terms of sheer imaginativeness.",Casino Royale

Even looking at the newly released DVD in light of the most recent James Bond movies this movie captures the tongue-in-cheek attitude that underlies all of the 007 films.  One of the biggest ""jokes"" in the ""real"" James Bond films is the fact that 007 just happens to have a gadget for every situation.  This movie takes the high tech gadgetry to its comic zenith.I don't care if this movie had five directors or fifty directors--if this movie wasn't around there would not be any of the Austin Powers movies. This movie was the template.  All you need to do is to see the flying saucer in Casino Royale to see where the Bob's Big Boy in Austin Powers came from.",Casino Royale

144,Drew-36,Complete Rubbish.,5,15 March 1999,"Casino Royale is a mess. Originally intended to be a ""serious"" Bond Film, it was felt it could not compete with Eon's Bonds so it was turned into a spoof. I bought the video myself recently, because it was on offer for £4.99. I regret paying that much for a film which can be described as complete rubbish. It is disjointed, dizzying, embarrassing and chaotic. There are one or two bright scenes, which I cannot particularly remember, but on the whole, you get the impression the film was flung together by someone who had lost interest in what they were doing. The film had five directors, which says something in itself. Most agonising about this pile of unadulterated tosh is the sad fact that what was probably intended to be funny turned out not to be even faintly amusing. The final scene is probably one of the most confusing climaxes ever, and is badly edited to make it seem even worse. The £13 Million this film cost to make is a sad waste of money, which could have been better spent on something else.Rent it or buy it if you must, but be warned that you will probably be wasting your money.",Casino Royale
145,bfm_1017,A delightful farce with a stellar cast in true 60's fashion,8,13 April 2006,"IF I saw this movie when it came out, I would have not have appreciated it. Like a bottle of Scotch, it is better as it ages. I just saw this movie in High Definition, fully restored and in its original wide screen format. Is shines like a pair of patent leather shoes. Clothes, cast, music, all absolutely gorgeous. Don't ask me to judge the story, I just had a blast watching all the above mentioned assets of the film and was well rewarded by not trying to follow the storyline, and just enjoying the film. Niven, Sellers, Allen, Welles, O'Toole (in his brief cameo), and all the beautiful women! What a treat. In my opinion, the REAL Bond films could learn something from this film, and not take their Bond movies so seriously. Of course it's obvious where Mike Myers got his inspiration for ""Austin Powers"". Peter Sellers was certainly one of the most talented comic actors of all time. It is a great pleasure to watch him at work on the silver screen. I will be adding this to my DVD library for sure.",Casino Royale

The wild idea of so many writers and directors time-slicing the film into a hilarious smorgasbord was more for those with an acquired taste for Out-Of-The-Box ludicrousness, than many traditional Fleming fans might care for. Hey,It's not Sydney Reilly, It's a comic knockoff of an Agent(s) of some MI6 Libertine squad. So Toke up; raises your mug, drink to the men who protect you and I.

147,possum-3,Some People Just Don't Get It....,9,5 February 1999,"When the Bond films hit big in the '60's, the only Ian Fleming novel that was not secured by the producers of that series was CASINO ROYALE, which was held by other interests.  In an attempt to exploit this, those who held the rights tried to make a legitimate Bond film, even trying to seduce Sean Connery into playing Bond--he refused, and they decided to produce the whole thing as as spoof.They blew out all the stops, making one of the wildest comedies ever made. If you're a Bond fan, you'll hate it for its irreverence.  If you're expecting an adventure story, you'll hate it as well.  But if you like simply twisted, surreal comedy, you will love CASINO ROYALE the more you see it.  Don't expect a direct story (although there's one lurking there if you watch it enough times to find it).  Just sit back, enjoy the wackiness, the tackiness, the subtlety, and the sheer, all-out over-the-top SPOOFING of so much of the spy genre and movie-making in general.It's not perfect, perhaps a little slow in the last reel, but its all in fun and then some.In particular, I love the music--jazzy, brassy, and as palpable a character as Sellers, Niven, Welles, or Allen.",Casino Royale

With 5+ directors and just as manywriters, its no wonder that the story makes no sense, lackscontinuity, and well... just plain fails.I will say one positive thing: the concept of the 007 numberand James Bond name being used by different agents is agood one.    Before I even ever saw this movie, I thoughtthat would be a good way to account for the different Bondperformers and personalities over the last 30 years.  Ofcourse, what makes this more impressive is that this filmcame out before the first casting change in the official Bondseries.But - and this is a BIG but - the film is still a pathetic,unfunny hodgepodge that is not worth the rental price.

149,kidcrowbar,I'm beginning to think you're a trifle neurotic,8,29 March 2002,"Apparently not for everyone, this is a quintessential example of a 60's farce.  As such it hasn't aged very well and some sequences, especially the slapstick finale, fall flat.Other scenes are as hilarious now as they were then: The Berlin Wall shots, the school for spies, anything with Orson Welles, Deborah Kerr, or Woody Allen, and the segment with Q and Peter Sellers. All the actors are at their best: Ursula Andress (the original Bond girl) as Vesper, David Niven as Sir James, and the countless character actors who show up in small roles.Of course you can't talk about this movie without mentioning the sensational soundtrack and Dusty Springfield's ""The Look of Love."" This movie is a feast for the ears as well as the eyes.It probably is a bit too long. By the time you get to the finale you're likely to be so burned out that you can't even begin to appreciate the slapstick. And Hera help you if you're watching this on commercial television!

150,jim_skreech,An incoherent mess.... with touches of genius,6,28 December 2014,"There was little that was duller than a Sunday in late 80s rural southwest England. And being at a boarding school from Monday to Saturday meant Sunday was my only free day - bookended by church in the morning, the Top 40 on the radio in the evening, and not much to do in-between. The video shop was far away, and the Arnie and Sly films that my schoolmates raved about were most definitely banned by my mother. Bond films were permitted though, and until the next film would get an airing on TV, I took to the films and TV shows from the 1960s that trailed on 007's success. The mapcap psychedelia displayed in the Flint and Matt Helm films was a colourful zany antidote to the greyness of the current era, and to the perplexed reaction of my 80s fixated classmates, I developed a real hunger for that specific genre. As it turned out, these films tended to be a Sunday afternoon TV staple, and became the colourful highlight to my weekend.Casino Royale has been viewed negatively by critics - incoherent, chaotic, indulgent, and worst of all, an unfunny comedy. It was certainly more enjoyable as a 12 year old than it is now. Much of the humour seems to stem from the older generation trying to lampoon Bond and the swinging mid-60s counterculture, whilst not really understanding their targets and subsequently coming out somewhat fusty and out of touch. As for the plot, there really doesn't appear to be one - with 6 directors working on the film, the story has no flow or point, and the film is best considered instead as a series of sketches.So why my 6 out of 10? The film still looks as great as is did when I first watched it, and is a real monument to the bigger-is-better creativity of mid-60s. My personal favourites are the darkly psychedelic scenes in East Berlin, the hugely stylish villain's lair at the end of the film, and especially the seductive meeting of Peter Sellers and Ursula Andress, soundtracked by Dusty Springfield's 'The Look Of Love', which stands out simply as a piece of 60s cinematic genius. It is a scene that certainly left 12 year old me frustrated that I had not been born a few decades earlier; I'd have the chance to be a dapper playboy when I'd be older, but not in such fine style. As I grew older I moved on from worshipping the 1960s, and it became clear to me that for 99% of the population, that decade was probably even more drab than the 1980s. But there is a 12 year old me still there that feels joy at catching zany old swinging films from the 60s, and whilst Casino Royale certainly did not represent the youthful, modish zeitgeist of the mid-1960s, it is a stunning display of that era's 'sky's the limit' visual flair and creativity, and for 60s aficionados, it's absolutely worth sitting through the poor jokes.",Casino Royale

How could respected actors such as David Niven and Peter Sellers lower themselves to this? The film is devoid of all humour and just bores the viewer.  This film went through a plethora of scriptwriters and directors and it shows, with the plot being a stitched-together patchwork of half-baked ideas, and jokes someone somewhere thought were funny.  A stellar cast list is completely wasted.  Niven has a line in the film: ""The enemy won't know which way to turn.""  Well, the audience certainly do - in the direction of the 'EXIT' signs.

Very remenicent of the mad-cap style Richard Lester used for the Beatles film ""Help"", only minus the Fab Four, it's funny & irreverent from start to finish.The plot? Well there is a plot, but it's hardly necessary, as the action & tom foolery carry the characters along at great pace. There's a veritable blizzard of famous faces in the background & the jokes come at the same pace (keep an eye out for Sterling Moss & Dave Prowse who later played Darth Vader). Everything is fair game & gets thrown into the joke melting pot. This brings the danger with it that the result could have easily been confused & messy, but the pitch is just right & the chemistry works to great effect.Time can be unkind to some humour, but it seems not to be the case with this film. The wise crack about the French policeman,...""You're a French policeman, in France. So why have you got a Scottish accent?""""Aye, that's a mystery to me too."" .... is as funny today as it was then, given the continued showing of early Bond films on tv, where the archetypal Englishman is still to be heard speaking with that wonderful, rolling Scots accent!As for David Niven (Sir James Bond) asking why our fastest jets couldn't catch the UFO...""Oh I see. They've stopped making them!"" .... this is just as relevant today as it was then, after so many ""Defence Reviews"" of recent years.All in all a good natured romp that takes a tilt at about every icon & preconception of the genre that was current at the time.

A little bit like the ending of Benny Hill's show where everyone just runs around after each other. It just wasn't my cup of tea at all.The beginning - the scenes with David Niven and his house and the castle in Scotland - well, that just didn't gel with what came afterward. The next scenes were too much of a jump from the opening scenes. The bit in Scotland was okay - it just didn't fit in with the rest of Scotland. I did like Deborah Kerr's character though. So different from her usual films.The idea of training a Bond to be able to resist women but being irresistible himself - nice idea. But it wasn't followed up.The rest was fine. I haven't read all the comments on IMDb but of those I have read, no-one seems to have mentioned Mike Myers and The Spy Who... films. This film, made in 1967, seems to have predicted a fair few things to come. It's predicted the Mike Myer films; it's predicted the gadgetry of Q and how preposterous some of it became; it's even predicted the slight tongue-in-cheek attitude of some of the later Bond films; and it's set the style of most of the later Bond films.I liked some of the scenes just by themselves. I loved the interaction between Ursuala Andress and Peter Sellers. She is GORGEOUS and he's amazing too - the scenes where he dresses up show off some of his other facets of mimicry. But just the chemistry between the two of them was great.And seeing Ronnie Corbett in a completely different role was a real eye-opener. A bit sleazy - rather like the compère in Cabaret.It's a real film of the sixties - the scenes, the fashion, the music and even the film sets.So .. if you can stomach the beginning and the end.. the middle bit's pretty good.",Casino Royale

156,maddox-richard,Up there with Bedazzled and Beyond The Valley of the Dolls,9,3 September 2012,"I'd avoided this movie for years assuming it was one of those bloated '60s comedies that aimed for madcap parody but ballsed it up completely (too many of those to mention). I'd seen a bit of the ending with Woody Allen larking about and that seemed to fit my assumption. I couldn't have been more wrong. This may have used a hodgepodge of writers and directors but somehow the end result is a spot-on satire attacking how far a gadget- heavy sex-crazed Bond had strayed from Fleming's ideal. It's of the messy but intelligent school of satire, akin Peter Cook and Dudley Moore's Bedazzled and Russ Meyer and Roger Ebert's Beyond the Valley of the Dolls. Someone else here rightly mentions the 1966 Batman movie. However what sets it apart from all of these is the quality of art direction, design, acting and music. Members of the cast who are in fleetingly still seem to fit right in, accents are hilarious and some performances are absolutely superb - namely Deborah Kerr as Agent Mimi, putting on her Scottish brogue to pass as M's wife Lady Fiona McTarry. The music is terrific, including a cheeky quote of Born Free and snippets of Dusty's Look of Love ( an aquarium sequence quoted by Baz Luhrmann in Romeo & Juliet). Finally, the cast is one of the most extraordinary to be gathered in one feature - it includes:Peter Sellers, Ursula Andress, David Niven, Orson Welles, Deborah Kerr, William Holden, Charles Boyer, John Huston, Woody Allen, Derek Nimmo, Ronnie Corbett, Bernard Cribbins, George Raft, Jean-Paul Belmondo, Jacqueline Bisset, Stirling Moss, John Wells, Burt Kwouk, Geraldine Chaplin, John Le Mesurier, Peter O'Toole.They are all fantastic.

158,MrGrundle,"O Sellers, Where Art Thou?",5,23 August 2006,"Even a luminous performance from the routinely sublime Peter Sellers can't lift this overstuffed foray into psychedelic cinema by master-director John Huston up from beneath the insurmountable weight of myriad red lights and filters, stylized kaleidoscope cuts and schizophrenic structure and pacing. Too bad, because as a series of vignettes this is a very entertaining film. The stars (tons of them, by the way!) are all very funny and engaging, particularly David Niven, Woody Allen, and Deborah Kerr. Burt Baccarach's score is punishing after a few hours, but it certainly seems appropriate. Huston even shows shades of the steady camera work and nuanced direction (Welles displays terrific eye gestures in his small role) that has typified his brilliant career. Seldom though, do so many nice little parts add up to such a disappointing whole. Bigger is not always better, and sometimes it is a lot worse. By the overblown conclusion to this one, I found myself lusting for silence.That being said, this film can be very enjoyable. The cast is truly remarkable, even John Huston is very good in his brief performance as 'M'. A bonus star for the cavalcade of sex kittens: bangs, beehives and scanty bikinis! Don't expect too much though, certainly not a Huston-grade effort.5/10* A headache, but worth it for Sellers!",Casino Royale

It had multiple directors, each with their own section of the film, so it's sort of a collection of vignettes. Also, Peter Sellers refused to work with Orson Welles, who he thought was in league with the devil (Sellers was eccentric, to say the least), so the casino scenes had to be shot without them both on the set at the same time. But the play (you can't call it work when people are obviously having such a great time) between long-time real-life friends Niven and Kerr make the movie for me and offset totally the dated psychedelic parts. Niven in the bath is a hoot. And Woody Allen's take on a super-villain, counting down to his end in hiccups, is classic. Plus there's that fabulous Burt Bacharach score.

If you're a dedicated ""James Bond"" Fan, you'll instinctively resent the over-the-top schmaltz in the production of this film. The storyline is so disjointed and so lacking in continuity, it's extremely difficult to follow the plot. Add to that, Cowboys riding their horses through a Gambling Casino, as well as the insertion of the Keystone Cops,...and what you end up with in my opinion, is little more than a big pile of film sewage.

164,theeoghshow-00387,"A few scattered laughs, but incompetent and near-incomprehensible",2,9 July 2021,"This is a movie that is nearly two and a half hours long, tries and for the most part fails to be funny, and has a story that fails to hook you largely due to how strangely paced it is and stupid and poorly communicated many elements of it are; on paper, that's probably one of the worst experiences that a movie can possibly be. Regarding my personal opinion, it's not quite that bad... but it's still pretty bad.The music and the editing; easily among the worst examples of each that I've ever scene. The score of the movie is repetitive and inappropriately used, and the timing of each use can be downright abrupt; nothing leads into it, it goes from dead silence to playing at full volume and seemingly random points. Meanwhile, the editing of the movie makes some parts of it near unwatchable; there are parts of the story that are extremely poorly communicated entirely due to how certain scenes are edited. Some of it possibly comes from the fact that this was a movie where they had to assemble something tangible out of a movie where they couldn't film all of the scenes they had planned, but most of it came across as straight-up incompetence.Even with all of the above, this movie could have been saved if it was funny. Unfortunately, most of it simply... isn't. Most of the jokes are terrible, and even the few that could work tended to have poor timing and delivery. The one redeeming factor the movie has is that it actually can be quite entertaining when the style of humour leads more into absurdism, but it doesn't do that nearly often enough to make the movie come anywhere close to being worth the time.",Casino Royale
165,jaster-7,I'm sticking up for this movie,9,4 August 2019,"Is it a great movie? Only for the campiness of this romp. What makes it fascinating to me then, and in retrospect now is, good or bad, you get a lot of entertainment in this movie.Star after star, plot twist after plot twist, gag after gag, talent piled on talent, and yet one could say greatness is not achieved. Not unusual for what may seem to be an over wrought production....but despite all the obvious flaws, I'm going to stick up, stand up, for this movie.Because:
1) It was a favourite with my neighbourhood gang and sibs to crack up at this movie - along the lines of The Magic Christian, and In Like Flint - we were fascinated by how adults behaved, and each of these examples was sexually titillating enough to excite and amuse us as adolescents, as well as this movie imbedded every one of these stars into our developing sophistication with actors of note.
2) The freaking soundtrack - hello?! Herb Alpert & the Tijuana Brass playing Burt Bacharach - to this very day, I want to smear those songs into my ears and go crazy with the perfection of this joining. This movie is part of my psyche. The Look of Love? Sexiest song ever. Come on! And beyond the individual hits of the movie, is the background music, like when they are doing the medicine ball strength competition at the castle. And the rompy old-time radio voiceover singer that ballads the story. Are these not iconic moments in your brain? They are in mine! The soundtrack serves as its own stand alone entity of this movie.
3) The beautiful people in this movie. Everyone is gorgeous. It's when I first thought Peter Sellers was completely hot (not so when watching Pink Panther and The Party, right? Ok, maybe a glimmer..), but here...he's one sexy, astute, cool JB. Then there's Joanna Pettet (perfection - could you find anyone more beautiful and alluring and completely unaware of it, to play Mata Hari?) and Ursula Andress...anyone remember when Mad Magazine spoofed it, and called her Ursula Undress? Forget about the cheesy sets, effects, and ridiculous farce of a story - just look at the gorgeous people in this movie, each actor seemingly in a perfectly preserved moment of their prime, or at least their iconic image. George Raft, David Niven, Deborah Kerr, Orson Welles, and Woody Allen...just the fact they are from all eras of Hollywood, all amazing talent, all in the same movie that's a totally ridiculous gallop, and they all seem to be fully giving their all to the campiness, preserving on film, at that particular moment in time, all together, and fully game to whatever this production was going to yield - well that's enough to make the movie fully worthwhile to me! You gotta love actors. This movie asks nothing from you but to have fun and enjoy.
4) No one involved with the movie seemed to take themselves or the project overly seriously - least not as seriously as the critics. This isn't to say anyone involved just phoned it in. Everyone gave over to the spirit of the farce that it is. Supported by the classy music, this movie holds a fond place in my heart for the sheer 'high interest' the movie has. Just to say, Oh look! It's ____! (Fill in the blank). Strong serious and character actors playing either totally to type, or totally out of type, for all it's worth. Really what's not to love?And that's why I'm sticking up for Casino Royale.",Casino Royale
166,Boromir007,Casino Royale (1967),7,18 November 2007,"When producer Charles K. Feldman realized that he couldn't get Sean Connery for the part he decided too turn Ian Flemings first novel into a spoof of the James Bond series. This is a good film, at least it is not bad anyway. First some positive aspects. The cast is a collection of fantastic and entertaining actors: David Niven, Peter Sellers, Orson Welles, etc. And some other amazing actors appear in guest roles: William Holden, Jean-Paul Belmondo, Vladek Sheybal and others. The soundtrack by Burt Bacharach is a masterpiece. Production designer Michael Stringer created some colorful and original sets and even referred to The Third Man at the SMERSH headquarters in Berlin. Now here is the bad news. Usually if I want to see a film the first thing I ask is: ""Who directed it?"". The answer would be:""John Huston, Val Guest, Robert Parrish, Ken Hughes, Joe McGrath."". ""Excuse me? Could you repeat that for me, please?"". It really doesn't matter how great they are individually (which they are), this film is a total mess, these five directors have totally different styles so it doesn't match and the script is incoherent to the last details. This is why the finished product is a failure. But it is still amusing. For instance when David Niven explains to the headmasters of the Secret Services from the great world-powers they look like joke shops is just plain wonderful, on the other hand there are scenes like the climactic battle in the casino: ridiculous and over the top. I mean they needed some deus ex machina solution to finish the whole thing.

This is an all-star cast of Cameos and Some of Hollywood's Greatest Directors, John Huston for one; AL Guest, et.al....If you can enjoy satire, this film is jam packed with it...and very very pretty girls, including an up and coming ""Jacky"" Bisset. (The Deep, Scenes From the Class Struggles of Beverly Hills, etc.) Some Hollywood Heavyweights too, (no pun intended...well, maybe) in the form of Orson Welles, George Raft, Jean Paul Bellemondo, William Holden, John Huston (as actor), David Niven, and some great comedic work from two masters: Peter Sellers (a member of the GOONs, [spike milligan]; Pink Panther Fame) and WoodyAllen.

The film is a series of really good, goofy NL/Phythonesque/LaughIn skits. This first one, with David Niven and Deborah Kerr hamming it up may be the best.The bit with Peter Sellers and Orsen Welles, as well as the scenes in the crazy whatever-it-is house with Mata Hari's daughter (Joanna Pettet) and the goofy Ronnie Corbett character are largely inexplicable--and even more inexplicably silly and wonderful!So get out the popcorn!

Sir James shook hands with people in mid fight, and when they all died, they all appeared in heaven. It wasn't funny, just stupid. Dr Noah's hiccoughs were cartoon?!?!? My God. The only positive thing in the whole film was Ursula Andress, who looked amazing in this film and, IMO, looked much better than when in Dr No. Otherwise, a complete waste of time.

The plot needed work,a lot of work, but have you ever seen a Bond film. Out of the twenty some odd bond movies there are three plot lines. At least there wasn't a giant solar powered lazer cannon in space or secret volcanic island, or George Lazenby. The movie is even funnier when you watch it now. If you squint when Peter Sellers comes on screen you can tell that Austin Powers is mirrored off his character Evelyn Tremble/James Bond 007. Thats not the only similarity between Austin Powers and Casino Royale, such as the fact that the women wear nothing but incredibly revealing clothing in both movies. Prehaps not the funniest movie ever, but if you're ever looking for a movie that's a little different then check it out.",Casino Royale
172,mollyshearergabel,This is a supremely silly movie,10,8 February 2006,"Enjoyment of Casino Royale may be generational limited. Also, it's British, with a British type of humor. Silliness and jokes about bodily functions and various body parts were much more appreciated then and there than by today's American audience, and the open-ended style of the plot, such as it is, was much more in vogue for comedies of the mid-to-late sixties and is less likely to be embraced now. Pity about that.That said, I think to be unable to enjoy this movie indicates some form of humor handicap. Trying to anal-retentively follow the details of the plot is not only unnecessary, but is detrimental to the experience. The obvious plot points are so boldly drawn that they hit you over the head, and they're pretty funny. The rest are just devices to provide an excuse for crazed silly behavior. Don't go into this experience looking for a worshipful Albert Broccoli type paean to the Manliness that is 007. This movie, made while there was still only one Bond, presciently made the point that Bonds were pretty interchangeable. It is the deconstruction of the Bond persona, in as many ways as five directors & a slew of writers could come up with. For those of us that love a good Bond spectacular for the stunts, the explosions, and the wink, wink style of ""I'm not really a misogynist, I just play one in the movies"" jokes, this is a great way to spend a couple of hours. Also, the nostalgia factor is high, look at those clothes! Look at that crazy hair & makeup! Look at Woody Allen back when he was just a kid! Come on, it's funny! Relax and enjoy it, don't worry about your dignity. I recommend it as a double feature with the Magic Christian, now that's an afternoon well spent.",Casino Royale

175,friend_of_harry_lime,"""Let Me Be Comforted. Doodle Me.""",7,17 August 2006,"This is a seriously underrated farce. Okay, it's too long, somewhat bizarre, and some of the comedy bits fall flat, but there are also moments of inspired hilarity (""He wants to wassle""). The thing to keep in mind is that this is a parody of spy films, and not to take it seriously as a Bond film (thought at times it seems less a parody than some of the ""official"" Bond films  have you seen A View to a Kill lately?). Also, it's quite the time capsule of '60s camp, with all its merits and its flaws. It's too hip, has really great music, and invites us to laugh at its own peculiar, self-referential approach to the spy film genre.Most of the actors are quite funny. David Niven hits just the right pitch as Sir James, and no one does befuddlement with more aplomb than Peter Sellers. And watching him do so while also trying to play a suave spy is a hoot. ""Isn't Evelyn a girl's name?"" ""No, it's mine actually.""The main drawback here is that there are simply too many cooks mucking up the stew. The narrative structure of the film overall tends to breakdown. This isn't a problem when the comedy is tight and sustains us, but when the comedy lags, as it does, for instance, when Marta Bond meets her father, the film lags.Still, it is fun, particularly if you know the Bond films well, and I suspect that its poor reputation stems from its sheer cheek (it's not for everyone's taste), and its uneven comedy.In the end, though, more hits than misses.7/10",Casino Royale

But this film simply does not work. The swinging sixties' version of the book is about as silly as it can get with absolutely no art in its silliness. Its attempts at comedic surrealism were in vain.The other Bond films up to the Casino Royale of 1967 starring the softly-spoken, Scottish James Bond everyone liked were cleverly satirical and ironic with Sean Connery delivering his lines with his tongue planted firmly in his cheek and a wry smile on his lips. And the iconic 60s' t.v. series that hilariously sent up glamour spies and espionage, Get Smart, was not only cleverly satirical but an exceedingly artful parody bordering on pure genius with Don Adams and the supporting cast saying their inspired lines written by the likes of Buck Henry with perfect timing and delivery. But Casino Royale, an 'unofficial' Bond film and the first to use the name without starring Sean Connery, is just silly for the sake of silliness with practically no redeeming features (see below).I have seen Casino Royale probably three times since 1967, including at the pictures during its Australian release back then, and with each viewing it gets worse. A couple of months of ago it was screened on commercial t.v. here on a Saturday night, I think it was, and about fifteen minutes' worth of it was all I could take. Even for one as nostalgic for the 60s as I am, Casino Royale was too much for one viewer, this one.A big-name cast doing and saying silly unfunny things with pretty, mini-skirted girls with the Mary Quant look scattered round rural and urban Britain are simply not enough to make a film effective anymore, if they ever were. Indeed, so averse am I to watching the 1967 version of Casino Royale, I am even put off going to see the current version of the film of the same title. However, I take comfort from the fact that no matter how silly and bad the remade version of Casino Royale may possibly be, it just cannot be as silly and bad as the film made in 1967.PS. I've given it two stars out of ten for Burt Bacharach's memorable theme music for Casino Royale and Herb Alpert's marvellous trumpet playing of that theme. The music was the best aspect of the entire movie. All right, then! 1967's Casino Royale may have one redeeming feature.",Casino Royale

Plus, intellectually it sweeps off the whole Bond bunch, giving not only an accurate of the sixties fetishes but the cold war taboos and clichés. Don't get me wrong, I've watched every Bond movie, loved many of them (featuring Connery, Brosnan or Moore, the others just suck), and enjoyed the cynical humour approach.

Arrest the director and writer for felonious assault on good cinema!",Casino Royale
199,Igorcio147,I'm speechless...,1,23 December 2020,"I just had to write this.Before watching this movie, I didn't believe that I'd give a movie a 1/10 rating any time soon - but here we are.I just can't believe how bad this movie was. If someone asked me to point out even a single element that I liked in this movie, I wouldn't be able to do it.The screenplay is a joke. It makes absolutely no sense, it feels like a Frankenstein's monster made out of some random scenes from random movies.Characters and acting is terrible, not a single character shows any basic emotions throughout the whole ""movie"" - well, maybe except for horniness (but I guess that's not an emotion, and definitely not a basic one).It's also terribly unfunny, I remember that only one (no, that's not an exaggeration) of all the jokes made me smile without the feeling of irony.Now for the most absurd part... the villain's plan is to... make all the women beautiful... and kill all the men that are higher than him... no, that's not a joke - that's literally in the movie.To sum that up, some would say it's so bad that it's good - trust me, it's not. It's being bad at its worst. I consider Transformers (the first movie I gave 2/10) a masterpiece when compared to this.",Casino Royale
200,dreadededdie,Great nonsense take with a stela cast,8,22 January 2021,"Loved it from start to end, great music, great comedy - very Spike Milligan in places which is odd because he had nothing to do with it (did he?).Not everyone's cup of tea - but then again what is?Fitted in brilliantly with the era. Fantastic fun - start to end.",Casino Royale
201,dediamondback,What were they smoking?,4,1 April 2002,"This movie has got to be one of the weirdest movies I've ever seen. Why would any distinguished actor have played a part in this drivel?  Deborah Kerr and Orson Welles are always great, but this movie is NOT.  I guess they were smoking a little too much during the creation of this movie to notice what it was about - if it was about anythig. I'm warning you, it has Woody Allen in it.  If I had known this before I saw it, well, I would not have seen it. Ugh what a bad actor. Anyway, I will admit that this movie did have it's moments, it could actually be a LITTLE funny, sometimes.",Casino Royale
202,naitsirk-1,Brilliant Madness,10,24 February 2009,"First of, when either watching or reviewing this movie, COMPARE IT to other insane movies - like Austin Powers - and NOT to other Bond movies. This is one big, trippy, disjointed, mad movie, and, no, it DOES NOT MAKE SENSE and no THE STORYLINE DOES NOT MAKE SENSE. But watch it anyway. Watch it with an open mind, be prepared for everything - cos everything is what you're gonna see. This has been called ""the ultimate anti-auteur work"" and it is, it is a brilliant chainsaw through all the ordinary conventions of film-making. But it is NOT a nerdy film. Anyone from any level of education will be able to watch and enjoy this movie IF they dispose of their in-born desire for a simple, logical storyline. This is like an Alice In Wonderland-version of James Bond, or even better, James Bond On LSD... watch it just to be surprised by the sheer craziness and contempt for logical progress that this movie represents. Watched in the right frame of mind, without bearing any prejudice towards it from reading all the bad reviews, and this is a GENUINELY GREAT movie. Yes, it's in shambles, BUT THAT'S THE ATTRACTION. If you want a neat, tidy storyline, go watch 'Pearl Harbor'. If you want thrill and risk, but without any pretentious, intellectual rubbish, but rather unhinged and uncontrolled insanity, this is the movie for you. it don't come better than this :) PS. watch it before buying it, since actually investing money in it before finding out whether it is suited to your style of humor might not be the best idea ;)",Casino Royale
203,dmcdknf,Parody as fine art!,10,13 December 2007,"Many Bond connoisseurs pan this movie as a travesty. This completely misses the point. This movie is a fantastic parody of all that it means to be Bond, while allowing ten of the best actors of their age to act the characters they play best. The concept is one of a sixties period piece poking fun at the suave and debonair 007, and his never ending supply of Bond girls. There is good fun to be had here for those who appreciate David Niven, Orson Welles, Woody Allen, Peter Sellers, and Deborah Kerr.Serious this movie is not, but as a huge Bond fan, I am more concerned with the un-Bond like trend of the last few films (007 drives a Ford and plays poker?? Bad foley work results in tire screeches during a boat chase?)than I ever could be with a heart felt poke of fun at an Icon. If 007 can't take it in stride, then no one can.",Casino Royale
204,larsgr,worst film ever made,1,8 January 2006,"Yes, forget about ""Plan 9 from outer space"", this is it! This film is much worse than any of the films usually rated as ""worst ever"", Ed Wood would never have lowered himself to this level of imbecility and sloppiness!But why did this film, that featured some of the greatest names in film history, people who really should have known what they were doing, turn out so bad? First of all we have the James Bond-mania in the 60's, people would go and see the film no matter what. Secondly,my theory is that the film is a case of the wrong people at the wrong place. Maybe the film turned out so extraordinarily bad,not in spite of, but because of all the ""great names""?When Casino Royale was released in 1967 it was one of most expensive films ever made, much more expensive than You only live twice, the ""real"" Bond film of the same year. How could so much money have been spent on rubbish? Maybe it's because no one dared to say ""no"" or ""stop"" to the great geniuses Orson Wells and John Houston(among many other geniuses)?As a whole the film is unwatchable, its a comedy but its never funny. It's not even bad in an interesting or amusing way, like the films of Ed wood. It's boring. It's stupid. And above all its sloppy.One scene very typical of Casino Royale is the gambling scene: Peter Sellers is Bond(at least i think so) and Orson Wells is the villain le Chiffre. Orson Wells likes doing some magic tricks, he gets to do that. Peter Sellers favorite party trick is to imitate indians and Chinese people, he gets to do that. But why does this belong in the picture? And why is it in any way funny?Of all the bad things in the film must also be mentioned the music by the very famous(of course)composer Burt Bacharach. It's extremely annoying!",Casino Royale
205,jasoninkuwait,So bad it is good?,4,8 June 2005,"I tried to like this, really I did. Regardless of the few witty parts, it was littered with campy attempts at nonsense. And it was ever so successful at the nonsense.Tons of cameos, hundreds of ubber-hotties (Joanna Pettet!!) and some of the all time greats: Orson Wells, Peter Sellers and Woody Allen. Even with the inclusion of these greats this film could not be saved from itself.The plot is a little mixed. Should I be following David Nivin or Peter Sellers? It one thing to enjoy a comedy of errors but entirely a different matter if your movie is just full of errors. Too many directors and too many directions.It is billed as the greatest spy spoof ever! I don't think they pulled it off. It was lost in silliness.",Casino Royale
206,id421,Hard to follow,8,13 June 2017,"I didn't realize this was a spoof of James Bond until I started watching it. Even then, I got a fair way in before I realized, because it doesn't hit you over the head with the fact. I thought I'd missed out on a classic Bond film, and got rather excited. While it wasn't what I expected, I still enjoyed it.As with most spoofs there are boring lulls between jokes, and some things are exaggerated until they are no longer funny, assuming they were to begin with. The story is a bit hard to follow at times too. However, there are some well done and humorous moments, and it features an impressive cast.Overall I liked it. It's not something to go out of your way to see. Nor is it a good choice for a movie night. But it's well suited for an afternoon, when you're bored, and there is nothing on TV.",Casino Royale
207,lazy-2,A great cast in a horrible movie.,3,1 October 1998,"For all the talent Casino Royale had to provide, it was amongst the worst spoofs I have ever witnessed.  Laughs are few and far between, and the majority of the jokes crash and burn.",Casino Royale
208,shoggoth,a big letdown,2,5 June 2000,"I had heard that this movie was a spoof, and I love the 007 movies.  When I had a chance to see it, I could not believe how bad it was.  It has great actors, but the script is very weak, since it's NOT funny.  The plot makes no damn sense towards the end.  I wish ""Casino Royale"", the book, would be made into a new movie, and not some bad spoof.  Too bad it would have to be made without Sean Connery.",Casino Royale

210,No Nickname,This is the WORST movie I have ever seen!,1,25 November 1999,"This movie is terrible! I have seen hundreds of movies, and this was by far the worst! It didn't even deserve the one star rating I gave it! I am glad it is not counted as a James Bond film, because it would give James Bond a bad name!! To start, it doesn't even have the traditional barrel and blood beginning, or the cool songs with silhouettes of naked ladies on the screen. It plays some classical music and just lists the peoples names and who they play. Now, lets not even talk about special effects. THERE WERE NONE!!!!! No, wait, I take that back. Two or three times in the movie they shined a red light of ""James Bond's"" face making him look like a cherry. And what about action? There biggest -- and only -- action scene is when so girl sprays a few people with a fire extinguisher to get away. That is it! No one gets killed (except for M, and they just talk about it, never show it). The movie has a stupid storyline, too. ""James Bond"" comes out of retirement to stop two underground organizations involved in gambling. He is some old guy that says the new James Bond (referring to the ones in the traditional films) gives James Bond a bad name because they are all women-crazy, and have so many secret gadgets that they are a disgrace to spy organizations. This guy is incredibly stupid, on top of all other things. When he takes over as M he changes ever secret agent's name to James Bond 007 to confuse the enemy. What is up with that?!? Also, the first 45 minutes of the movie have nothing to do with ""James Bond."" It shows him at his house, M ""dies,"" and then he is at the house of M's wife and daughters, where he just eats, talks with them, and overall says nothing about M. Then, about 45 minutes of the way through they try to kill him with a bomb (which regretfully didn't work). After that, he was on camera for maybe 30 minutes the rest of the movie, which is bad because this movie is about 135 minutes long. I mean, for 30 minutes some stupid girl tries to seduce this writer to become a secret agent, which I never got the point of. She has him try on about 50 outfits and asked him if "". . . your personality changed with each costume?"" There is no point to that part. What about the rating? It was given 3 stars and is said to be comedy. Not a single joke was told in the whole movie, but it was kind of funny to see the crappy acting, but not worth the time it took to watch the movie. I don't know what category this would fit into. Not comedy, action, drama, horror, or mystery (though that is probably the best bet). To end, the one star rating I gave this movie is a hundred times more than it deserved. I would be willing to bet that the Blair Witch Project cost more to make then this low budget, crappy acting, and terrible story-line movie.",Casino Royale
211,slada,People miss the point,8,10 January 2001,"For those of you that don't ""get"" the point of this movie, stick to Austin Powers, you deserve the pap that modern day hollywood churns out. For those of you that understand the concepts of ""farce"" and ""surrealism"", this is the movie for you. There were numerous directors participating in the making of this movie which gives it a wonderfully disjointed feeling which is quite intentional. As for the ""Batman"" style ending, I guess the word camp (other than an outdoor experience) doesn't mean much to the uninformed movie goer. This movie obviously doesn't appeal to the average movie buff, but I wish they still made movies like this instead of Austin Powers et al.",Casino Royale
212,russweiller,The best 007,10,3 May 2006,"It's not the typical James Bond formula big bucks earner, and thats why I love it. The story, though loosely based on Casino Royale, is unpredictable throughout. You might have to watch it more than once to see the bigger picture because there is just so much going on. Not only action packed but very funny in places. Without any doubt, this is a British movie, filmed entirely in England (and Scotland), and it represents the best of British movie making before it's demise. There was only one scene which was questionable, on religious grounds, depicting half clad women dancing around Lord Buddha is offensive. Apart from that, this really is worth watching. The real 60's is represented here, not a 90's Austin imitation.",Casino Royale
213,zilahararian,Psychedelic Extravaganza!,10,29 July 2006,"I highly recommend this film to anyone who is an aficionado of psychedelic or 1960's film/music/art. This was the most expensive psychedelic project of the entire era to my knowledge, in any format. The sets alone make the the feature worth seeing. Having a keen familiarity with the era and culture may not be enough to prepare one for appreciating this standout curiosity. One must also be widely versed in James Bond, novels and all, to understand much of the humor. That humor is set against an invisible backdrop of the unprecedented popularity of James Bond at the time. A degree of comfort with all things psychedelic is yet another requirement to fully digest this cinematic delight. Please note that this was a very ""in"" movie, to coin a phrase from the era, which also explains why ""Casino Royale ('67)"" receives unfavorable reviews. As this lavish production was targeted for the ""in"" crowd of that bygone era, it is only slightly more alien to the general public today. If you are ""in"", this high water mark of the era is an experience not to be missed.",Casino Royale
214,Narhloki,Terrible,1,16 October 2003,"We went into this film knowing it was a spoof and a comedy, but not only was it not funny it was completely baffling. Was over 2 hours long but even so seemed to be missing vital plot points and leaped from one ridiculous scenario to another. What were they on? You will need some of whatever it was to understand and or sit though this film.",Casino Royale
215,Hanski71,A psychedelic classic,9,1 December 2007,"A very imaginative, psychedelic film. Beautiful sets and still very good quality production values. I think this must be one of the best looking movies ever made, and surprisingly well preserved picture + great music. Just don't take it too seriously or expect a coherent, logical plot or anything like that. Rather, you newer know what to expect next and that's what's great about this film. A visual treat and 60's attitude that is very refreshing to see nowadays. And of course very, very beautiful women, even more beautiful than in ""real"" Bond movies...

216,aquadog737,This film is sacrilegious for serious Bond fans,1,9 April 2010,"If you are an Austin Powers fan this is a great study of how that concept came to light. If you are a serious Bond fan (as this reviewer) this film is sacrilegious and should be avoided at all costs. The only thing this film has in common with Ian's first Bond story is the gambling and the use of the James Bond name which is used too much and treated like toilet paper. Some good actors and directors and would have appreciated this effort much more (in terms of a Blazing saddles genre) had they not used the Bond name or Casino Royale title. A true shame Ian's first book was tied up because of the Climax TV performance (Barry Nielson's TV portrayal) which is included as bonus footage. This unfortunately was probably Ian's and Bond's big break but it opened the door later for the story to be hijacked by this group. Thank god Barbara and team finally had the chance to do it right with Craig. It would have been cool however to see Connery start out rough and then work his way into the suave character we all new. Hoping to see Barbara and team develop Craig this way. Hint, hint.",Casino Royale

220,hr_marchant,A strange psychedelic movie which disappoints,4,11 January 2004,"I have read in a movie-book from the sixties in which David Niven is identified as being James Bond, along with Lazenby, Moore and Connery, sadly this is not true. Casino Royale is a psychedelic pastiche that happened to be made in a wrong decade. Despite the many big actors, the picture is ruined by irritating filming and a rather fragmented manuscript. Although there are some highlights such as Jimmy Bond, played by Woddy Allan who in one scene(he's only in two scenes) escapes from an execution squad while saying, what might be the inspiration for one of Homer Simpson's catch phrases ""So long suckers"" Peter Sellers also acts convincingly but asides that, ""Casino Royale"" is not really worth watching.",Casino Royale
221,monkeymocha,"A great symbolic '60's film, but too long!",7,26 November 2006,"This started out as a delightfully entertaining romp in true '60's style. Amazing talent working on it and the luxury of the over-the-top '60's sets was wonderful. It was a film that made fun of all films and almost worked, but they made it too long! To catch the innuendos and references for the black jokes took a lot of concentration, and it isn't easy to concentrate when tears are rolling from your eyes because of laughing. It should have been much shorter, but it does seem that everyone involved in making this film was on drugs; and so a really great insight into the the wacky wild world of that decade. Ursula Andress never looked more beautiful; Dalia Levi wasn't in it for long enough (and I wish they'd let her sing at least one song!). It is just great to see it now, in 2006, and recognise all the people involved in it who were stars then and became much bigger stars later (Ronnie Corbett was a surprise.) It was also great how so many famous faces put in an appearance just for the laughs, (Peter O'Toole, Anjelica Huston and Jean-Paul Belmondo, for example.)I am sure everyone had fun making it, and it shows. Probably the inspiration behind the birth of other strange humour in the U.K., such as Monty Python. Negative: too long; too much overkill; too many allusions for the average film-goer. But a great film which is symbolic of its time. To really enjoy it, break it up into 2 or 3 episodes!",Casino Royale

224,misteriddles,For 60s stylists only,3,17 January 2005,"One could be forgiven for thinking Casino Royale was written under the influence of 1967's hippest drug, LSD. Just like acid, there's plenty of groovy visuals, but it's impossible not to lose the plot. Today's audiences will find little to sustain them during this two hour trip unless, like me, they're fans of 60s modernist design and fashion. On the modernist front, the most unforgettable set is Ursula Andress' apartment, which comes complete with giant fish tank, sunken lounge, revolving bed and various pink pieces of classic mod furniture. The villain's lair, with its biomorphic sculptures and shapes, follows close behind. Also notable for a set design point of view are the back rooms at the Blau Engel in Berlin, which pay homage to the Futurist-inspired, distorted angles and perspectives used in the sets for the early German cinema classic, The Cabinet of Dr Caligari. Musically, the score represents the great Bacharach at his cheesiest. It's saved only by Dusty Sprinfield's seductive version of The Look of Love, which beautifully underscores the seduction scene in which we first see Andress' amazing pad.",Casino Royale

This movie is so confused that you'd have to be insane to find a logical plot. Even so, the wonderful actors David Niven, Peter Sellers, Ursula Andress and more make this movie one of a kind.The sixties feeling is soothing with the music of Burt Bacharach. It is laugh-out-loud funny every-once in a while. Especially when Orson Welles a.k.a. known as Le Chiffre is doing his ""magic"" around the baccarat-table.Time and money has been spent on the backgrounds, they are very elaborate and cool.

226,jpcovalt,James Bonds make jokes,6,4 February 2017,"A schizophrenic Bond experience. In this take on Bond everyone is Bond, but this leads to multiple leads competing for screen time and underdeveloped villains. The plot is as hard to follow as the master spy is elusive and the jokes are easy to miss when one has to keep asking ""how did we get here?""This film is worth watching for the riotous fun found in the last third of the film and sprinkled throughout the rest. Also making it worthwhile are the incredible sets ranging from a Scottish Lord's Gaudy Manor, to the classic bond villain hideout, even an entire spy school set in a German expressionism nightmare house.The Bonds all attempt to be icy cool with varying degrees of success, and although they all brought their own gags good enough to justify their inclusion, it was the indecisive, meandering following of the handful of agents that made the movie so boring. Watch it for the Woody Allen and Orson Welles scenes, for the climax, and for the Bond Girls, but don't watch it for a coherent story. Could have been better with a half hour trimmed off.",Casino Royale

I suggest that people skip this movie.The movie had many big name stars from 1967. But the plot was weak and boring. An older James Bond, played by David Niven, is asked to return to spy duty to stop the international crime group called SMERSH. The older James Bond is very different from the younger Bond we normally see in the movies.My wife left the room after 20 minutes. My 15-year old daughter gave up after an hour or so.

It's just plain silly fun.The plot is virtually impossible to understand, but that really doesn't matter. Just let the gags wash over you - you'll get drenched if you pay attention.And my favorite line in the movie is missing from the ""memorable quotes"" section. Jimmy Bond has captured [""The Detainer""? - some pretty girl -- I told you the plot is pretty dense], and subdues her by placing her, nude, on a table with wide silver bands holding her down (and covering her ""R-rated"" bits). She asks ""Do you treat all your prisoners this way?"". Jimmy Bond (Woody Allen), rapidly responds, ""Yes, I do -- I learned it in the Boy Scouts."" (quote is approximate)",Casino Royale

To me this was the most humourless logic-less stew of a movie ever created. Before I had the bad luck to see it my number one was Soul Plane. But not any more. This one was even duller. It had no plot, no main character, no common sense whatsoever and it made me fall asleep several times. For your life's sake do NOT NOT NOT see this movie, you risk a permanent brain damage!

Also, it's slow paced and with 131 minutes of duration it would surely benefit from a 'director's cut' to put the movie in 90 minutes, (although 60 minutes would be fine also). It's totally outdated and you can't enjoy it even a little bit. I love old movies but this one really hit into my nerves, because of its lousy script and poor direction...
