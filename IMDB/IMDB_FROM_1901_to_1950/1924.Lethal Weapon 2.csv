0,MartinHafer,Just turn off your brain and enjoy...if you can.,3,14 August 2020,"Although the first ""Lethal Weapon"" film was a huge success, I only mildly enjoyed it. Although I liked the characters, this movie relied too much on huge explosions and stunts...to the detriment of the plot. But who am I to complain? The film was enjoyable AND made a ton of money. As soon as I turned on the DVD for ""Lethal Weapon 2"", I realized that it might just be MORE explosive, unrealistic and stunt-soaked....as the opening scene probably cost more to shoot than half a dozen entire movies! It had everything....exploding BMWs, a helicopter rescue, machine guns galore and more. As a result, I pretty much resigned myself to turning off my brain (once again) and accepting it for what it is....nothing more or less. Though, in hindsight, I had a MUCH harder time doing it with this film than the first.During the course of this HUGE intro scene, the baddies manage to escape BUT they also did so without the million dollars in South African Kruggerands they had illegally brought into the USA (due to the boycot of the apartheid regime at that time). The big bad boss-man (Joss Ackland) is NOT happy...and he lets his lackey know this in no uncertain terms. As for the good guys, Riggs and Murtaugh (Mel Gibson and Danny Glover), they now know that there is some South African connection on the case. But instead of following up on this, the pair are instead assigned to protect a star witness, the ultra-annoying Leo Getz (Joe Pesci). So how does this all tie together? See the film.
So, is this any good? Well, yes and no. It all depends on you. If you want more explosions and insane stunts than you ever could imagine in a film, this one's for you. If you want a funnier film than ""Lethal Weapon"", then this one's for you. If you want a film that makes sense....well....keep looking. The film just isn't logical nor does it ever try to be--especially with GIANT South African hit squads (pretty much a mini-army) operating in Los Angeles with complete immunity! For me, that made watching the movie a bit of a chore after a while--especially when a squadron of attack helicopters hit Riggs' trailer with about 200,000 machine gun rounds and no one seemed to notice! But again, as I noted above, the first film in the franchise made a fortune...and this one managed to earn even more! Brainless or not, the filmmakers must have been laughing all the way to the bank with this one.",Lethal Weapon 2
1,TheLittleSongbird,A sequel that is just as good as the original,7,10 July 2017,"Coming from somebody who really enjoyed the first 'Lethal Weapon', while not considering it quite perfect, this is quite high praise. Although there are sequels that are as good as their predecessors is nearly better ('Godfather Part II', 'Terminator 2', 'Aliens') there are many others that don't measure up and some even disgracing them.'Lethal Weapon 2', thank goodness, is not one of those films. But saying that it is almost as good as the first 'Lethal Weapon' is genuinely meant, even if it is not in the same league as the three sequels listed above that are almost as good and nearly better. 'Lethal Weapon 2' has its faults but the good things are many and very obvious to spot.It is let down a little by a script that's at times inconsistent, with the tone sometimes forced and confused and like it's trying to do too much. While the action is mostly great, the helicopter scene is somewhat implausible, more so than most of the script in the first film.Most of the performances are spot on, but two didn't really do it for me. One was Patsy Kensit, who is attractive but looks lost. The other is Joss Ackland's hammy villain who looks like he belongs in another film entirely. Not things that everybody is going to share but just personal opinion.However, like 'Lethal Weapon', the way 'Lethal Weapon 2' is shot and designed screams slick and stylish while Richard Donner once again directs with an assured hand. The score is atmospheric and groovy.Despite not finding all the script working, a lot of it does with some cracking, sometimes hilarious humour, tension and dark pathos. The story is tightly structured and plotted, with some great tension and always being fun. Loved the bathroom scene, one of the best and most unique on film.Once again, the action is slick and bursts with excitement and tension, apart from one that suffers from excessive implausibility. It is very easy to see why the chalk and cheese chemistry of the polar opposite characters of Riggs and Murtaugh became so popular, very rarely in a buddy-cop film has this kind of chemistry been so entertaining and perfectly pitched.Mel Gibson continues to excel in a performance as witty and intense has before. Danny Glover gives Murtaugh the right amount of spirit, subtlety and no-nonsense attitude. They are matched well by Joe Pesci, who is a motormouth delight, and Derrick O'Connor who gives much more of a sinister edge than Ackland (have noticed that in both films that the henchman has always been the more memorable and better played than the lead villain).In summary, very well done and just as good. 7/10 Bethany Cox",Lethal Weapon 2
2,bkoganbing,Diplomatic Immunity with impunity,5,4 April 2017,"Lethal Weapon 2 finds the LAPD's most reckless cops Mel Gibson and Danny Glover going after some drug dealers and finding they are covered by diplomatic immunity.This was really a bit much to swallow. Back then in its last days before it finally fell, South Africa's white supremacist government was desperately trying to hold on to friends. I doubt very much that it would employ a Joss Ackland as a consul who uses their diplomatic immunity with impunity to allow him to run rackets. In fact right up to the end they were involved in a propaganda publicity offensive and this drug dealing would have truly counteracted that.This film also introduces Joe Pesci to the Lethal Weapon regulars. He's a wire puller and fixer who's been skimming some loose change from his money laundering for the South Africans and has defected for his own health which gets seriously put in jeopardy. Patsy Kensit plays a secretary at the consulate who gets something going with Gibson that proves fatal.Ackland because of the attention decides to declare war on the LAPD figuring they can't respond. Let's just say he pulls the diplomatic immunity card once too often.Fans of the series should be happy.",Lethal Weapon 2
3,Leofwine_draca,The archetypal buddy action comedy,9,18 October 2012,"There's nothing not to like about LETHAL WEAPON 2, a follow up to the Mel Gibson/Danny Glover-starring smash hit that improves on the first film in every respect. It pretty much follows/sets up the template that we've seen played out over and over again, more recently in the likes of the RUSH HOUR trilogy. Gibson is the crazy one, Glover is straight-laced, and together they have to team up to bring down a gang of criminal nasties.Watching this film for the first time in many years, I was surprised by how fresh and inventive it felt. The comedy comes thick and fast with Glover's hapless ageing cop acting as the brunt of many of the jokes. As much as I like Glover here, the film really belongs to Gibson, whose crazed persona adds endless vitality to the movie. It never feels like he's acting, more like inhabiting the role. Other newcomers include an on-form Joe Pesci as the lovable Leo Getz, and the quite awful Patsy Kensit, who seems to think she's in a romantic comedy.The ham acting of the performers playing the South African villains (headlined by Joss ""Diplomatic immunity!"" Ackland) is a cheesy delight and the film follows the template of including one great over-the-top set-piece after another (the toilet bomb is a highlight, I think). Things culminate in a finale that's dramatically satisfying to the nth degree, although of course with a film series this successful it wasn't long before a third movie came along.",Lethal Weapon 2
4,SnoopyStyle,Great chemistry enhanced by funny Joe Pesci,7,1 January 2014,"Martin Riggs (Mel Gibson) and Roger Murtaugh (Danny Glover) are back. The movie opens with the cops in hot pursuit of some drugs. It ends up with a big action chase and a helicopter to fly the bad guys away. The bad guys are South African and they threaten Murtaugh and his family. So the captain gives them an easy job babysitting a witness Leo Getz (Joe Pesci) who turns out to have laundered around half a billion dollar worth of drug money. And somebody immediately tries to kill him.The chemistry is still great for the two guys. The car chase scene right off the bat only highlights their relationship. Joe Pesci adds a fun comedic element into this duo. This is energetic fun. It's funny, and it has good action. The only thing off is the South African bad guy. He is too much like a Bond villain. That's a different franchise.",Lethal Weapon 2
5,gavin6942,"Not as Classic, but Still Good",7,3 August 2016,"Riggs (Mel Gibson) and Murtaugh (Danny Glover) are on the trail of South African diplomats who are using their immunity to engage in criminal activities.This is not as ""classic"" as the original, and lacks that Christmas element, but we have some new fun. Joe Pesci is here, though not used to his fullest. The ""diplomatic immunity"" idea is great, and there still remains debate to this day (2016) if such a thing could be used to facilitate crime. Allegedly, the Chicago mob used this method in Panama.But the key scene that makes this film memorable is the ""toilet bomb"" scene. If nothing else, that one scene will make this go down in history as one of the essential buddy cop movies.",Lethal Weapon 2
6,jboothmillard,Lethal Weapon 2,5,14 August 2009,"The first film was a very good action thriller with a few good laughs, this sequel from same director Richard Donner (Superman, The Omen) is pretty much the same film, but concentrating a little more on laughs. The film starts with L.A.P.D. officer partners Martin Riggs (Mel Gibson) and Roger Murtaugh (Danny Glover) chasing a car which when it crashes they discover is filled with valuable gold coins. After Murtaugh is attacked at his home, he and Riggs are sure the car chase guys that got away are linked. But Captain Ed Murphy (Steve Kahan) assigns them to guard witness in a drug case, Leo Getz (Joe Pesci), who they find out has contacts to the men who attacked them,. They are in fact carrying out cocaine smuggling, and one of them murdered Riggs' wife! So after the death of Riggs' new lover, secretary Rika Van Den Haas (Patsy Kensit), he and Murtaugh seek both revenge and justice against the head villain, Arjen Rudd (Joss Ackland). Also starring Derrick O'Connor as Pieter Vorstedt, Darlene Love as Trish Murtaugh, Traci Wolfe as Rianne Murtaugh and Mark Rolston as Hans. Gibson and Glover are still an enjoyable bickering duo, Pesci is a little annoying, but that's what makes his character funny, and there are I suppose one or two good chase and explosive sequences, so not all that bad. It was nominated the Oscar for Best Sound Effects Editing. Mel Gibson was number 17 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars. Worth watching!",Lethal Weapon 2
7,Tweekums,A less than subtle sequel,7,22 September 2017,"After the success of the original 'Lethal Weapon' a sequel was only to be expected. This story sees partners Riggs and Murtaugh investigating drug gang they discover is operating out of the South African consulate in Los Angeles. These are particularly dangerous criminals who are hiding behind their diplomatic immunity of course that won't stop our protagonists; especially after Riggs learns that they were responsible for the death of his wife four years previously. If that weren't enough our duo have been tasked with babysitting Leo Getz, a federal witness who had previously laundered money for the South Africans.Having really enjoyed 'Lethal Weapon' I looked forward to the sequel but when I watched it I was somewhat disappointed; instead of being an action film with a degree of comedy the level of comedy is cranked up to a silly level although I did like the running gag about Murtaugh's car taking more and more damage. The politics of having racist South Africans as the villains was about as subtle as a kick in the head meaning they felt like pantomime villains rather than truly menacing some poor South African accents didn't exactly help. So much for the problems; on the plus side there are some great moments too; it opens with an impressive car chase and later includes shoot-outs, explosions and even a couple of villains getting dispatched with a nail gun. Mel Gibson and Danny Glover have a good chemistry as Riggs and Murtaugh and Joe Pesci provides plenty of laughs as Leo Getz. The romantic subplot involving Riggs and a South African secretary, played by Patsy Kensit, was a bit unnecessary and ended in a most ridiculous manner when Riggs takes her home after they are nearly killed at his place he might as well have killed her himself! Overall this is by no means a bad film but it was disappointing after the excellent opening instalment in the franchise.",Lethal Weapon 2
8,BA_Harrison,On a par with the first.,8,1 October 2013,"With the possible exception of Martin Rigg's mullet, which actually looks like it's been given a bit of a trim, everything about Lethal Weapon 2 is bigger than the first movie: the explosions are more explosive, the shoot-outs more shooty, the car crashes more crashy, the widdly guitar more widdly, and the warbling sax more warbly. As 80s action flicks go, this is definitely one of the best for spectacular vehicular chaos, ballistic mayhem, random acts of death and destruction, and tuneless music.Jeffrey Boam's script delivers on all counts, matching Shane Black's original in terms of wit, pathos, and excitement, and although it does introduce what would become one of the most irritating characters in cinematic history—fast talking money launderer Leo Getz (Joe Pesci)—at least Boam has the good sense to inflict a lot of pain and suffering on the guy in the process, Leo getting more than a few bruises as the story progresses.Seasoned Hollywood director Richard Donner handles proceedings well, balancing the light-hearted moments and the gritty action just right (a trick he seems to have forgotten come part 3), and with the benefit of a bigger budget than before, he gets to pull off some truly impressive action scenes, including the amazing destruction of an entire house on stilts.Part 2 also benefits immensely from a pair of memorable villains—South African diplomat Arjen Rudd, played by Joss Ackland, and his truly wicked henchman/assassin Pieter (Derrick O'Connor), and the welcome presence of the wooden but still very lovely Patsy Kensit, who very kindly strips off for a sex scene (the price we must pay for that pleasure is yet another Mel Gibson ass shot, but at least it's only a side view— not a full on crack shot like in the first film!).",Lethal Weapon 2
9,wes-connors,Lethal Sequel,6,15 February 2010,"The second ""Lethal Weapon"" movie develops the buddy relationship between hotshot Mel Gibson (as Martin Riggs) and graying Danny Glover (as Roger Murtaugh). In the first film, they gave each other a new lease on life (more for Mr. Gibson, of course). Here, Mr. Glover does not seem as retirement-oriented; and, the once suicidal Gibson seems practically happy-go-lucky. The duo is asked to watch over money-laundering Joe Pesci (as Leo Getz), who is planning to squeal. Unfortunately, Mr. Pesci comes with some really mean South African drug-runners. They want to kill the Los Angeles police department employing Gibson and Glover.Director Richard Donner moves it excitingly, with a lot of violence and a little sex. This time shirt-shedding Gibson gets to mate with a pretty blonde, ""Eighth Wonder"" singer Patsy Kensit (as Rika van den Haas). Gibson thinks it's ""Rika Haagen-Dazs"" and gets her shirt off, too. You have to admit, they both have cute nipples. Also, Glover's pretty daughter Traci Wolfe (as Rianne Murtaugh) does a condom commercial which, Pesci says, ""Makes me wanna buy rubbers."" Gibson cuts down on his drinking and smoking, and learns to get out of a straight-jacket like Houdini, which comes in handy, as you'll see. Glover gets a big toilet joke.Too bad filmmakers couldn't find a way to bring back the tremendously effective Mitchell Ryan and Gary Busey from the first film; but, replacement team Joss Ackland (as Arjen Rudd) and henchman Derrick O'Connor (as Pieter Vorstedt) make you miss the original villains less. The soundtrack is very nicely done, with The Beatles' George Harrison, The Beach Boys, and Eric Clapton contributing original material. ""Still Cruisin'"" was released as the accompanying single, but stiffed at #93 on the ""Hot 100"" chart. Mr. Harrison's tuneful ""Cheer Down"" (heard over the closing credits) wasn't a single, but became a #7 radio ""Track"" hit.This, the ""Director's Cut"" of the movie has, ""Over four specially added minutes,"" according to the DVD notes, which are described as: ""Riggs wows the pretties at a hotel spa before getting to Getz. Murtaugh receives bad bodywork news from an auto repairman after his beleaguered station wagon sees some Riggs-piloted street action. Plus, feisty Leo shares a newly included scene in which he recalls a suspect's address by complex spins of numbers that, well, no one can tell it like Leo. And no one would follow his lead but Riggs and Murtaugh. It's police procedure, 'Lethal' style."" It's an enjoyable, franchise-moving sequel.****** Lethal Weapon 2 (7/7/89) Richard Donner ~ Mel Gibson, Danny Glover, Joe Pesci, Derrick O'Connor",Lethal Weapon 2
10,bevo-13678,Joe Pesci simply brilliant,10,29 March 2020,"I like the bit where he says ""diplomatic immunity"" but the shoot him anyway",Lethal Weapon 2
11,Calicodreamin,Good action,7,10 April 2020,"Lethal Weapon 2 delivers on the action, starting in the very first scene and keeping the pace going throughout. Gibson and Glovers buddy cop relationship developed nicely from the first movie into this one, keeping interest in the characters. The plot itself is fairly well developed, but lacks a bit on delivery. Whats with the south african consulate taking credit for killing gibsons wife years earlier? how does that even fit in? But overall a solid action movie.",Lethal Weapon 2
12,Boba_Fett1138,At times it even surpasses the original.,8,21 February 2006,"This movie is at least as good as its predecessor, at times it even gets a better movie than the original.Just like ""Lethal Weapon"" this movie is just very basic action material. It has got a standard script with basic stereotype villains and plot. But yet ""Lethal Weapon 2"" and all of the other Lethal Weapon movies are better than just your average action-flick. It's better because of a very simple reason; it has good Riggs and Murtaugh in it, played by Mel Gibson and Danny Glover. The two of them (and director Richard Donner) have a great chemistry together. A very welcome addition to the cast is Joe Pesci as Leo Getz. His character is also one of the reasons why this movie is perhaps even better than its predecessor and original.The story is standard but it all is very well executed. There are some nicely done action sequences and some good villains, who are always important for a good action movie. Main villain of the movie is being played by Joss Ackland and he is quite unforgettable and strong in his role, even though his character is a bit underused in the movie perhaps. There are some great sequences in this movie that are close of becoming classic some day, such as the 'bomb on the toilet' sequence. But seriously, the only reason why this movie is so great to watch is due to the chemistry Mel Gibson and Danny Glover have together. The dialog and the way they handle the situations are very realistic and fun to watch at the very same time.It's a very basic but very well executed and fun movie, that gets two thumbs up from me.8/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",Lethal Weapon 2
13,view_and_review,Lethaler,7,13 February 2020,"There are a lot of reasons to rave about ""Lethal Weapon 2"": the comedy, the action, the plot, even the music. I'm sure all of these things have been highlighted before so I'd like to highlight something different.""Lethal Weapon 2"" was one of the rare American movies that had the courage to address South Africa and apartheid when it seemed like every movie focused on Russia as the bogeyman. Not that Russia wasn't a major nemesis, but South Africa was getting a total pass. To be honest, as a country we were too cozy and comfortable with South Africa considering what they were doing. I really appreciated LW2 putting South Africa on blast like they did.Politics aside, LW2 was a fabulous follow up to ""Lethal Weapon."" The addition of Joe Pesci was just terrific. His character was great comic relief and he complimented Murtaugh and Riggs so well. LW2 was a remarkable model of how to make a sequel: keep your core, add a nice complimentary character, and vary the plot. A simple equation but effective.",Lethal Weapon 2
14,anaconda-40658,Not Lethal Enough.,4,13 January 2016,"Lethal Weapon 2 (1989): Dir: Richard Donner / Cast: Mel Gibson, Danny Glover, Joe Pesci, Patsy Kensit, Joss Ackland: Inferior sequel to Lethal Weapon opens in the middle of a mindless high speed chase where cars flip and crashes abound without much thought on innocent civilians. Mel Gibson returns as Martin Riggs and he is fired up and seems to keep going despite obstacles. His partner, played by Danny Glover is attacked in his home along with his wife by masked assailants. There is a tie here to what happened Riggs and his departed wife. Glover springs some humour when his daughter's big acting break comes within a condom commercial prompting ribbing at work. Joe Pesci is also quite comically engaging as a witness they are assigned to protect. Pesci is loud and obnoxious yet seemingly likable. Patsy Kensit plays the secretary to the film's villain. She hates her job and becomes the next romantic interest to Riggs but one cannot help but dislike the handling of this character, especially given the already dreaded past of Riggs. The villains have all the life of a store window mannequin with laughable thugs with shampoo looking long hair that seems fresh out of a commercial. The action is over the top with lots of bullets flying and Riggs going full force on survival. In the end the original film packs a much higher lethal delivery. Score: 4 ½ / 10",Lethal Weapon 2
15,HotToastyRag,The toilet bomb one!,8,20 October 2021,"The girls in the audience will probably name the second Lethal Weapon as their favorite. While the first movie established Mel Gibson as a grieving widower with a great body, the second movie allows him to share that body with another woman. Patsy Kensit plays both his love interest and a crony of the bad guy. And since all the ladies know the wild rebel isn't exactly ready to settle down yet, they can watch the love scenes without feeling jealous.What's Danny Glover up to in this movie? Quite an explosion. That's right, folks: this is the toilet bomb movie. It's a great scene: funny, dangerous, tense, full of friendship, and with moments of great acting. This one scene pretty much sums up the franchise, showing all the reasons why the Lethal Weapon movies are so enjoyable to watch.An addition to the cast in this movie is the hilarious comic relief, Joe Pesci. Danny and Mel are assigned to protect him before his court date, and every scene involving that side plot is funny. Joe gets into trouble constantly, he doesn't understand police business, and he actually thinks he can be helpful! Audiences must have loved him, because he comes back in the third and fourth movies.DLM Warning: If you suffer from vertigo or dizzy spells, like my mom does, this movie might not be your friend. The first few minutes have handheld camera movements, and that will make you sick. In other words, ""Don't Look, Mom!""",Lethal Weapon 2
16,AaronCapenBanner,Sequel Is Just As Good.,7,5 September 2013,"Mel Gibson & Danny Glover return in this equally fun, action packed film as they are assigned to protect a government witness(Joe Pesci) whose life is in danger from South African gangsters who want to preserve Apartheid, something which both Riggs and (especially) Murtaugh oppose. The case becomes more complicated when the gangsters go after Murtaugh in his home, then Riggs discovers that these crooks have a far more personal connection to his life than he had realized.Film starts off with a bang, and seldom goes wrong; one of the few sequels to measure up the original, with interesting story turns and character development, and a refreshing use of continuity.A winner.",Lethal Weapon 2
17,FlashCallahan,You give a whole new meaning to the word 'dropcloth'.....,8,18 June 2014,"Soon after finding one million dollars of South African currency in a crashed BMW, Riggs and Murtaugh are assigned to keep an eye on Leo Getz, who is scheduled to testify in a case. But Arjen Rudd, the minister of diplomatic affairs for South Africa, doesn't want Leo to testify. Rudd turns out to be the man that Riggs and Murtaugh were after in the case they were working on before Leo was placed in their custody, which doesn't look very promising when Leo is kidnapped by Rudd's men. In a confrontation with Rudd's right hand man, Riggs is told the true circumstances behind the death of his wife, and this sends Riggs over the edge once more.......The essence of Lethal 2 is more of the same, but bigger, louder, and more comic book. And seeing that this took the biggest film of 1989 off the top of the U.S. box office, it's clear that Silver and co. were on to a winner.As with the first film, this relies on rich dialogue and wonderful set pieces to win over the audience, rather than narrative.It starts as it means to go on, with a brilliant and funny opener, and after a wonderful break from the action, featuring Murtaugh's daughter in a commercial, the film goes a little darker in tone, and the writers add a wonderful dimension to Riggs with the revelation concerning his wife's demise.It's a rollicking action movie, nothing more and outside of the Murtaugh extended network, the rest of the characters are just your action movie stereotypes.But it still has the best bathroom scene ever...",Lethal Weapon 2
18,Aaron1375,Great Sequel...my favorite of the series.,9,10 March 2003,"This is my favorite Lethal Weapon movie.  Murtaugh and Riggs have to protect a government witness from these South Africans running some kind of illegal business...I think it is drugs or something of the like.  They tried to go after these people, but unfortunately they are actually diplomats and have immunity from prosecution.  I don't think you can just run crazy and commit crimes like they did in the movie in real life though.  Joe Pesci who was actually working for the criminals as a money launderer plays the witness. This movie is just great.  It has it all action, comedy, and drama.  Pesci is a great addition to the cast as well as he provides for some good laughs. Though the highlight in this one has to be where Glover's character Murtaugh is caught on the toilet with a bomb on it.  Gibson's character Riggs, falls in love with a gal working with the diplomats/criminals and you know will have the feeling watching it that it won't end well.  All in all a great movie that is fun to watch.",Lethal Weapon 2
19,Wuchakk,Buddy cops Gibson and Glover are back for a sequel better than the original,7,19 November 2015,"Released in 1989, ""Lethal Weapon 2"" stars Mel Gibson and Danny Glover as L.A. cop team, Martin Riggs and Roger Murtaugh. In this sequel they team up with a witness (Joe Pesci) to take down big-league South African drug dealers who have diplomatic immunity. In the meantime Riggs romances an employee of the consulate (Patsy Kensit). Jenette Goldstein is on hand as a fellow cop.I wasn't impressed by the first 30-40 minutes, but the three main characters drew me in from there with their warm camaraderie mixed with a bit o' comedy. Like the original, this is an over-the-top, cartoony cop thriller with ludicrous James Bond-isms. You have to accept the outrageousness in order to enjoy it, just as you do with the Bond flicks and similar cop thrillers, like 1977's ""The Gauntlet,"" although the latter's superior IMHO, as are the Dirty Harry films. While some aspects are predictable, there are a couple original and impressive parts, like the toilet sequence and the money-explosion scene. The film also scores pretty well on the babe front with Kensit and Goldstein, plus a couple others. Anyway, I marginally prefer this one to the original.The film runs 118 minutes (Director's Cut) and was shot in the greater Los Angeles area.GRADE: B",Lethal Weapon 2
20,zetes,Slightly better than the first,7,11 May 2008,"A worthy sequel. In fact, I think it's a bit of an improvement, with tighter plotting and more kinetic action sequences. I also liked, to my surprise, the addition of Joe Pesci as a witness Riggs and Murtaugh are protecting. Yes, he's more than a tad annoying, but he's annoying in a mostly funny way. I also very much liked Mel Gibson's love interest, played by the cute Brit Patsy Kensit, who unfortunately never made it very big. The sequence with the bomb attached to Murtaugh's toilet is classic, and the shot with the woman cop getting blown off her diving board is (unintentionally) hilarious. Also side-splitting: the aging henchman played by Derrick O'Connor, who becomes a master of kung fu whenever the shot gets dark enough for a stunt double to take his place.",Lethal Weapon 2
21,mm-39,This one is pretty bad.,3,2 November 2002,"Spoilers!!I hate this one, but it is better than the others after this, they just keep getting worse.  I hope Gibson has the smarts to stay out of the next one.  A lot of the same with humor, ie the toilet, kids, etc.  How much farther can we watch their relationship evolve.  Drugs, bad guys why South Africa!  I found that unbelievable, maybe South American, some country in the Golden Triangle would have made the script better.  It seems the late 80' early 90's had the blond bad guys ie Die Hard, the mighty Ducks play Ice Land Gary Busey in the last Weapon, etc. Hollywood repeats itself over.  This one with a similar story has to go over the top.  The attacking the police, the beach condo scene, and the fight at the end, and way over the top Gibson's girlfriend killed by the copper attack were too much.  Like many part 2's, they get worse, and 3 or 4 in this series picks up speed downhill. 3/10",Lethal Weapon 2
22,Mr-Fusion,Back for Round 2,7,23 July 2012,"Based solely on its abilities as a sequel, ""Lethal Weapon 2"" is pretty damn cool. This thing's all about the big set pieces; that blistering chase scene in the opening moments, helicopter shootouts, and an inventive way of toppling a stilt house. The gags work pretty well, too, thanks to the chemistry between the leads. That offers room for Pesci's comedic foil (and he fits in well with the overall scheme).I have issues with the script and how it handles character motivations, big reveals, etc. But there's something about this movie that helps one to gloss over those issues (again, grand scheme of things). it's not perfect, but it is a lot fun.7/10",Lethal Weapon 2
23,namashi_1,Entertainment!,9,31 August 2011,"'Lethal Weapon 2' is Entertainment, in it's truest form. This Blockbuster Hit offers everything you would want to see in a film. It has humor, it has great action, it has an interesting story to tell, and it has, it's leading men delivering superb performances! Like it's prequel, this one too, is a winner! Gibson and Glover respectively reprise their roles as LAPD officers, Martin Riggs and Roger Murtaugh, who protect an irritating federal witness, played by Joe Pesci, while taking on a gang of South African drug dealers hiding behind diplomatic immunity. 'Lethal Weapon 2' is as entertaining as 'Lethal Weapon' was. As mentioned, it's a film that offers great entertainment. The Screenplay by Jeffrey Boam is first-rate, and is full of memorable moments. Richard Donner's Direction, like always, is note-worthy. Cinematography & Editing are nice. Action-Sequences are very good. Performance-Wise: Gibson and Glover deliver superb performances in here. The both of them, share a flawless on-screen chemistry and deliver wonderfully from start to end. Joe Pesci is stupendous. Patsy Kensit is good. Joss Ackland is excellent as the bad guy. Others lend good support. On the whole, A Winner All The Way! Grab a Popcorn and Get Ready For Some Great Vintage Entertainment! Two Thumbs Up!",Lethal Weapon 2
24,Smells_Like_Cheese,"Double the lethal, double the weapon, double the fun! :D",8,7 July 2005,"A terrific sequel to one of the first action duo films that worked well. Adding Joe Pesci to the cast, what a great choice! He was so funny, together, Mel, Danny, and Joe are the three stooges of Lethal Weapon. They work together so well. This movie has everything that you could want: action, romance, comedy, and drama.Again, like in my last Lethal Weapon comment, must we go on for ten sentences? I mean, is it just me or isn't that a little silly? I think so. It's like, you can't just put down you liked the movie or hated it? I miss the old IMDb! *sob!* 8/10 PS: Ask me questions about the movie if you have doubts about me witnessing it's glory.",Lethal Weapon 2

26,OllieSuave-007,Crazy action sequel!,8,15 September 2015,"This is an action-packed cop sequel pairing up again Mel Gibson as Martin Riggs and Danny Glover as Roger Murtaugh on a mission to stop a gang of South African diplomats using their immunity from U.S. law to commit crimes. From start to finish, it's a non-stop rush of humor and action, from the gun-totting showdown at the diplomat mansion to high speed chases.Gibson and Glover continued their at times frustrated partnership but spelled great chemistry together and delivered enough humor to keep the film engaging enough to go along with the mad rush of all the action scenes. Riggs' suicidal tendencies and Murtaugh's too-old-for-this-s?it mantra continue to become two intriguing focal points in the story. The addition of Joe Pesci as Leo Getz spell headaches for the cops and adds onto the craziness, but I thought he was very annoying in his acting and his voice is very cringe worthy.***spoiler ahead*** The ending is a little anti-climatic as I think it was a little rushed and were wasn't enough lasting drama in places were it is supposed to be serious ***spoiler ends*** Overall, it's one of the better action sequels out there.Grade B",Lethal Weapon 2
27,thesar-2,Whatever Leo wanted...we Get.,10,4 July 2010,"My parents actually took me to see Lethal Weapon 2 in what still consider the greatest summer movie season of all time: 1989. I hadn't seen the original but you absolutely don't need to; this incredibly stand-alone sequel tells you everything you need to know about the two leads, Riggs (Gibson) and Murtaugh (Glover) in the very first 15 seconds.I was absolutely blown away from the get-go and planted at the edge of my seat in the theatre the entire screening. Now, 21 years later and probably that many, or more, viewings, I'm still on the edge of my seat with excitement and awe in this fantastic film. In fact, this recent time I watched it, all the magic (SEE: Movie Poster) was back and I couldn't help but clap in the closing on how much fun I had for the 21st time watching it.A lot of films advertise the multiple number of improvements in sequels in reference to the # in the series. For example, 2x The Action, Three times the Suspense, etc. This one, if I recall, did that obligatory: 2x times the action, 2x the comedy, 2x the fun, or something like that. Though I liked the original Lethal Weapon, this did take everything to the next level. In fact, they elevated the magnitude of all that was right in the first one not by 2 but by ten.Though Pesci (Leo Getz) is a great and comedic addition to the gang (though no matter how many times I've seen this, I still can't follow his ""laundering money"" speech) with such classic lines like ""They F**K you at the drive-thru. *Repeat*,"" nothing beats the original members. Gibson is on top of his career as the rejuvenated ""lethal weapon"" from the first installment and Glover just goes along beautifully for the ride. You can sincerely see both having a blast, as if when they're laughing on screen and Director Donner yells cut, they continue rolling in laughter.The boys are back in L.A., this time researching the mysterious cougarans and the racist South African diplomatic immunity protected baddies while babysitting a state witness, Getz. The three cause city-wide chaos, uncover a mystery left open in the first Lethal Weapon and Riggs ""getz"" some. No, not with Pesci.Throw in some political statements (SAVE THE DOLPHINS!) which I literally hate when I see them either obviously or subliminally inserted in this series, and that's it. Really.I've heard that they had some ""rough outline"" of the script and the Director let the actors mostly improvise. So be it; this movie was hilarious, action-packed, deep, well paced, starts with a bang and ends on a justifiably tearful note. From beginning to climax, it's just one incredible scene after another and the writer/director knew enough when to give us a break, but not for too long – just enough to get ready for more excitement/humor.Oh, and the score's great, the soundtrack's wonderful: George Harrison's ""Cheer Down,"" The Beach Boys's ""Still Cruisin' (After All These Years)"" and Eric Clapton's ""Knockin' On Heaven's Door"" are three of my all time favorites for movie music, the acting and even the over-the-top at times action sequences are believable and the lines were classic. 21 years later, I find myself quoting this movie, and most people I speak them to, know exactly what I am referring to, or can finish it for me. Such as the ""They F**K you"" and my friends will fill in the ""at the drive-thru!"" or ""Whatever Leo wants"" ""Leo Getz. Get it?"" This is a MUST-SEE for any fans of the action-comedy and is the ultimate buddy-cop film. Two decades later, it holds up beautifully today as if it were just made.Side Note: Later in 1989, or perhaps in early 1990, I only owned three videocassettes that I watched over and over and over, well, because they were the only three I had. Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade and Lethal Weapon 2 were my very first two, followed closely by Batman. So, I did watch and rewatch the second installment of Lethal Weapon multiple times, even without seeing the first until years later. Heck, I don't think I saw part one until after the third one came out in theatres. I was a tad bit disappointed in the original, only in reference to seeing all the action and comedy of part two whereas the first was more of a serious take on the ""lethal weapon"" Riggs. Nevertheless, part one's still good, butLethal Weapon 2 is a classic.Side Note 2: The only other times that comes to mind where the first installment is really good and the follow-up sequel tops in spades: Star Wars Episode V: The Empire Strikes Back, The Godfather Part II and Aliens.",Lethal Weapon 2
28,FeastMode,stupidly enjoyable,5,23 June 2020,"I am so surprised that i'm finding myself somewhat enjoying these super old movies. it is still FILLED with stupidity, but like with the first, i like following the two lead characters. i found it to be a significant step up from the first in basically all areas. the action was pretty decent and exciting for the most part. i guess i'll keep going through the series (1 viewing, 6/22/2020)",Lethal Weapon 2
29,ElMaruecan82,"Not only it's great, but it's almost greater than the first ...",9,25 September 2012,"Just when you thought you had enough to make an anthology book, the film starts with one hell of a car chase sequence, catching you totally off-guard, and another one with an unforgettable conclusion, -although a bit gruesome, but take my word that the bad guy 'had it coming'. Just when you thought no explosion would ever surprise you, ""Lethal Weapon 2"" is remembered as the one where Murtaugh is trapped with a bomb in his toilet, although I found the explosive diving board more shocking and disturbing.When you thought you had 'good' bad guys in the first, wait until you meet the villains in ""Lethal Weapon 2"", the mastermind is Arjen Rudd, the ministry of affairs for the South African consulate, played by Joss Ackland and his hit-man, the slimy and evil Vorstedt (Derrick O'Connor). To give you a glimpse of their level of evilness, not only they belong to the government that was practicing segregation (the apartheid still existed in 1989) but they use their diplomatic immunity as a bullet-proof vest to cover some cold-blooded killings, among other malevolent actions.You have villains who not only kill but can't get killed and if I said that Hans Gruber from ""Die Hard"" was slightly superior to Mr. Joshua, it's like the writers finally understood that vileness could be scarier, more effective and more infuriating when it uses the appearance of respectability, like when you have a bunch of LAPD officers pointing their guns at them, on the verge of a successful arrest, and then are forced to leave. The comparison with Nazis through the 'Master Race' insult is a historical shortcut but not necessarily irrelevant regarding the context, but the film cleverly avoids a blind Manichaeism by inserting the character of Rika, a young South-African secretary who doesn't approve everything from her country.And through Rika, it's two birds hit by one stone, because she and Riggs fall in love, and trust the script that it's not a romantic subplot for the sake of it. Everything has a purpose in ""Lethal Weapon 2"" and serves as a build-up for a final confrontation that would be ten times more spectacular, thrilling, violent and emotionally driven than the first opus. And we all know how a formulaic or conventional climax can ruin even the greatest action films. I remember I gave a positive review for ""Commando"" but the climax of ""Lethal Weapon 2"" would almost make me reconsider my opinion. Anyway, the writers know that the more you'll hate the bad guys, the more you'll cheer at their demise.And it works indeed. Martin Riggs will be enraged as he's never been and Murtaugh himself, who plays the good cop, or the too-old-for-this attitude, can't let the bad guys get away with some crimes they committed. Well, let's just summarize the whole film, otherwise, I would end up spoiling it, the script makes the final confrontation personal, so personal than the last bullet shot and the line that accompanies it is the perfect pay-off to all the little bits that angered us. And although it's an overused line, the 'this time, it's personal' never resonates as something cheesy and forced. We're so engaged with Riggs and Murtaugh, that we share their laughs and joys as much as their sadness and fury.Besides, ""personal"" is a word I like when it comes to the ""Lethal Weapon"" series because the action, as spectacular as it always is, never distracts from the motives, from what goes through Riggs and Murtaugh's hearts and minds, and the plot's center of gravity: their relationships. In ""Lethal Weapon"", they had to know each other to get along, in ""Lethal Weapon 2"", they're inseparable and even their constant disagreement is the cement of their complicity. The toilet-bomb scene manages to distract us from the comical aspect of Murtaugh's position through some genuine interaction. At one point, Murtaugh, wants to say something to Riggs, no word is spoken but Riggs understands, and so do we, that's friendship at its best and we understand them because in a way, they also became our friends.Naturally, we find Riggs and Murtaugh in their opposite lifestyles, Murtaugh's family has grown up and one of the film's running gags concern a condom ad where Rihanne acted, Riggs still live in a trailer in the beach with his dog, Sam, he still loves the Three Stooges. The power of a sequel is to create newness with old material, but ""Lethal Weapon 2"" doesn't take it for granted, yes there is some Riggs and Murtaugh of the first opus in the opening car chase, but it would have been tiresome had it lasted the whole film. ""Lethal Weapon 2"" didn't recycle the same kind of interactions for different situations but rather featured different interactions for similar situations, and the strike of genius from the writers is the insertion of Joe Pesci's character: Leo Getz, a crooked accountant who blew the whistle about his client's money-laundering activities.Riggs and Murtaugh are assigned to protect him, and then the duo becomes trio. Pesci plays a small, loudmouthed, annoying character, punctuating his sentences with so many ""OK OK OK OK"" the only answer you want to give him is ""Shut up!"" along with some pinching and slapping. But far from being a simple comic relief, Leo consolidates the two characters' interaction by giving them a same target and happens to be indirectly linked to the bad guys, so in his own way irritating way, he's so significant that it's impossible to imagine the film, let alone the franchise, without him.It's obvious to me that ""Lethal Weapon 2"" captures the magic of the original film with such efficiency it would less qualify as a sequel than as a continuation of the level of greatness initiated by the first, and I'm not even exaggerating because whatever made ""Lethal Weapon"" memorable is twice as great in the second opus.",Lethal Weapon 2
30,Pjtaylor-96-138044,Even better than the first.,8,19 April 2020,"'Lethal Weapon 2 (1989)' is one of the rare sequels to be better than the original. From the moment it opens, it's a blast. Almost everything sees an improvement here. The action is more exciting, the characters are more likeable, the performances are more refined, the plot is more consistent, the pacing is tighter, the music is less overbearing, the villains are more compelling and the one-liners are more iconic. I mean, seriously, this contributes not one, but two of the all-time great movie one-liners. Once again, the piece's best - and most focused on - aspect is its central relationship, which builds upon the work done in the previous entry and feels like a genuine friendship. It's fun to be around these guys, who often make each other laugh as often as they make us do the same. Indeed, the film is actually really funny. It's a tightly refined action-comedy, with the right ratio between action and humour. Actually, it often does both at the same time. It's really well-written, remaining consistent across its character work and its set-pieces. Once again, a lot of its main plot is pushed into its final third. However, the narrative ebbs and flows over the course of the flick and feels highly refined. Much of this is thanks to its stand-out villains, whom are easily the most engaging in the series. They're essentially corrupt government officials but their apartheid-supporting nature gives their actions a racist undertone that makes it all the more satisfying to see them get blown away. The action sequences are as often elaborate as they are underplayed, being breezy when they're meant to be fun and brutal when they're meant to hurt. Having said that, the experience isn't supposed to be taken entirely seriously (the Looney Tunes audio cue that plays over its opening should clue you into that). Still, it's always compelling and it's even somewhat affecting on occasion, too. It's the best entry in its (as of yet) consistently great series. It's also one of the best action movies of its decade. 8/10",Lethal Weapon 2

The things that made the first movie a success made this film a success. There is still plenty of action and comedy mixed in with each other.Mel Gibson and Danny Glover are back as butt-whooping cops. This time around, they must protect Leo Getz, a talkative con businessman. Before they do much, they get into trouble with the South African people.The acting once again is splendid. Gibson and Glover have great chemistry. It's not everyday when you see old guys play successful bad guys. This certainly did me in.Overall, this is a great sequel. I liked everything about this film.

34,secondtake,"Don't forget, the ""lethal weapon"" is Mel Gibson and his gun",7,21 December 2013,"Lethal Weapon 2 (1989)The first half hour of this movie is such an empty mixture of very fast chase scenes and some dull talking between supposed bad guys you might not get to the final hour which is fun and funny and as good (in a way) as the first Lethal Weapon from two years earlier. Same cast, same crew, same assets.The problem at first is partly that we don't know who the bad guys are. We have no reason to fear or hate them. We just know that Mel and Danny have to be in on some new awful crime situation. That requires faith, so okay, we keep watching. The opening chase is highly kinetic and violent and spectacular, if you like that kind of thing. It is also a heads up for a couple scenes later that are also really spectacular —a ridiculous machine gun festival from a helicopter (if they have helicopters that have rocket grenades and boom, that's that), and a really ridiculous yanking down of a spectacular building with a GMC pickup truck (an amazing highlight of the movie).Yeah, it's a wonderful mixed bag. By the end I was loving it the way you love things like this—not as film studies, but as a lowbrow good time. There are some classic scenes, also ridiculous—like the great toilet one—and some filler, of course, but it clicks along and is a worthy sequel. If you liked the first, you'll like the second.However, it's worth saying the first one has an elegance at times that makes it not just more artful (who cares?) but more compelling. Just the way the first scene is handled (in the first movie) makes you want to know what's happening, and you worry about the next few scenes because of the first one. Here, it's more a continuation of affection—which means you might have to see the first one before this, in case you haven't!",Lethal Weapon 2
35,CuriosityKilledShawn,"They're back, they're bad. He's black, he's mad.",7,24 April 2007,"The topical plot of Lethal Weapon 2 may seem a little dated now, but Soud Av-ree-gan villains are always despicable and who doesn't love to them get blown away.In this second installment in the LW series, Riggs and Murtaugh babysit FBI witness Leo Getz (a wimpy, eager to be friends Joe Pesci), much to their displeasure. Stuck with nothing much to do, they decide to investigate the criminals Leo is testifying against-a rude lot of Soud Av-ree-gan diplomats with immunity to commit as many crimes as they want. Riggs also takes a fancy to their secretary Rika (Patsy Kensit), but obviously their romance isn't going to last. She might as well have a death-clock counting down on her forehead.Richard Donner seems more involved in making LW2 a better film than the original. This time he shoots in Panavision (why he didn't do this first time around I don't know), allows more time for character development and tries hard to make a political message out of the South African Apartheid situation. Even in his previous film Scrooged, which came out a year earlier, he had anti-apartheid messages. And, if you're really sad like me, you'll notice that Riggs and Rika bang their heads together when they first meet in the exact same way that Frank Cross and Claire Phillips do in Scrooged. And his then pro-NRA posters are still hanging around in the background. Donner later reversed his opinion on this organisation.I always felt that the original Lethal Weapon was far too plain and straight-forward. It lacked spark in every way, but LW2 introduces more characters, has more sophisticated action and a better plot. Michael Kamen however pretty much cuts and pastes his score from the first and even rips-off his own Die Hard score in a couple of cues. This got worse in LW3.The ending could have killed the series off had Riggs died, which is what Shane Black originally intended. We would have been spared the awful LW3 had this been so. But instead Riggs manages to fight off death and stay alive in Murtaughs arms despite being shot about 86 times. A nice touch having Bob Dylan's ""Knockin' On Heaven's Door"" playing over his potential last moments alive though.After this the series became too comical and diluted. They SHOULD have killed him.",Lethal Weapon 2
36,The-Sarkologist,It was good when it came out - not so much anymore,6,20 July 2013,"How is it that the forth movie in the series seems to romp all over the movies before it. Lethal Weapon III was really bad, though this movie is a little more enjoyable. The plot is clear and clichéd, though it does have a little twist. The bad guys are simple drug lords (if there is such a thing as a simply drug lord, though that does tend to be the case in Hollywood movies) making millions from drugs. The catch is that they work for the South African consulate and are hiding behind their diplomatic immunity.This movie opens with a car chase through the streets of Los Angeles, though the chase I don't think is a gripping as some that I have seen. It has lots of explosions and machine gun fights, violence, action, death, and the humour of two cops that seem to go really well together. The overall action of the movie though is not all that great and does not drag me back to it. I remember when I first saw it, I loved it but soon got sick of it.Lethal Weapon II introduces Leo Getz who plays a more major role in the next two movies, though Gibson's love interest is not Rene Ruso, but rather a consulate worker who is killed. The purpose of this is because they obviously don't want to bring her into the next movie yet create Gibson's character as one who will not dump one woman for another.All in all this is a typically average movie. I remember that when it came out it created a lot of interest but in the end it is quite dull and I think will pass easily away, if it has not done so already.",Lethal Weapon 2
37,slightlymad22,One Of The Best Sequels Ever Made,10,27 December 2014,"Continuing my plan to watch every Mel Gibson movie in order, I come to Lethal Weapon 2Plot In A Paragraph: The boys are back in town as L.A.P.D. officers, Martin Riggs (Gibson) and Roger Murtaugh (Danny Glover) who must protect an federal witness (A brilliant Joe Pesci), while taking on a gang of South African drug dealers hiding behind their diplomatic immunity.It's easy to forget how big this movie actually was in 1989. Batman was the big movie of the year, and there was loads of sequels, Indiana Jones 3, Back To The Future 2, Ghostbusters 2, Star Trek V and a Bond movie. I don't think many people expected it to do as well as it did. But by toning down the violence and upping the fun, it ended up the third highest grossing movie of 1989. I'm probably in the minority, but I think this is better the the first movie, and is the highlight of the series.I love the chemistry between Gibson and Glover, they seem to have a real affection for each other. And they both look like they enjoy playing off Joe Pesci, who is a welcome addition to the cast, at times it's like watching the three stooges (that's a compliment) Patsy Kensit looks absolutely gorgeous. The surprise to me is how menacing Joss Ackland was as Arjen Rudd the villain of the movie, he is superb.It has a few problems, continuity errors and poor stunt doubles, but it's well directed, well acted with great pacing, and the perfect balance of big action and big laughs. Although I'm not sure how I feel about the ""happier ending"" than what Shane Black wrote (with Riggs dying) but without it, there would be no Lethal Weapon 3 or 4.With a domestic gross of $147 million Lethal Weapon 2 (only Batman and Indian Jones out grossed it) was by far the highest hit of Gibson's career.",Lethal Weapon 2

39,johnnyboyz,"It accentuates some of the things we didn't take to in the 1987 original, while removes a lot of what we did.",5,5 April 2012,"Most sequels just aren't usually that good, are they? Lethal Weapon 2 is the sort of film in which characters tumble out of fifteenth storey windows; land in a communal swimming pool; thrash around in the water for a while, before getting up and out so that they may dust themselves off and move onto the next set piece. That was fine in the first film, because it was nonsense and we knew it was and the film knew it was as well - what was important was the fact it was propping up this really intimate and often touching story about a man going through a process of shelving his suicidal ideation and rediscovering the love for his job. Mel Gibson's Martin Riggs was that character in the first, someone stumbling once again upon that wash of emotion often referred to as ""job satisfaction"", a man once bent on mourning the death of his wife and generally uninterested in living for much longer - the first scene in this second instalment has him state his ""love"" for ""this job"" as he hares down the street in an unmarked police car chasing some villains. Go figure.This second Lethal Weapon film is, at least to a degree, again Riggs' film; a piece depicting his dissipating grief as he sees fit to kick off a relationship with a newfound woman, as well as allowing him to tie up some rather personal loose ends when the true extent of his wife's death becomes clearer through the adventure he undertakes here. This would have been fine had there felt as if there was some actual heart to proceedings, and the said content didn't feel like a papering over what are essentially a series of stunts involving helicopters; cars and exploding toilets. If there was a mite of honesty to what transpires, and forgive me if it strikes you as a premature reveal, then I dare say Gibson's character should have passed on there and then in faithful accomplice Roger Murtagh's (Glover) arms on that container ship during this edition's finale.The good news is that Gibson and Glover are good value. Their combination, as was with the first, plays off itself with a series of binary opponents: where Murtagh wears his suit to work, Riggs is more laid back and casual in his dress; where one of them finds cheap office humour hilarious, the other deems a good deal of maturing is in order, in fact the two actors rebound off one another really well and they genuinely look as if they're enjoying one another's presence. It is Murtagh's contemplations this time that dominate, a man nearing retirement but without a hobby to occupy his time, while his disassociation with the large family he bares begins with the fact he eats tuna when all others have stopped and realises just how old his daughter is getting when she appears in a television advertisement which, in a few words, takes him aback.The adventure involves South African politicians who use their stature as a front to disguise that of a smuggling ring. The leads are effectively in it together to fight racism, what with the fact this group are South Africans in favour of the then-ruling South African Apartheid regime and act as the film's villains. It is here the film takes a shy, if unbalanced, glide into the deep end of ""issue"" movie making, or the addressing of an ""issue"" for a piece of mainstream entertainment, when it attempts to systematically raise true to life awareness on top of telling this tale on top of dealing with this meagre character content. There is an uncomfortable sense of the South Africans being there - they are easy targets, and the film will win fans cheaply in this regard.Of all people, a Joe Pesci character named Leo Getz is implemented into proceedings; a witness who needs protecting and who is assigned to Riggs and Murtagh's care but whose presence soon sees both of their paths more intrinsically linked than first appears. Leo is good value for a while, but is misused; Pesci has played characters who have had a tendency to dominated dialogue driven scenes, but always as the intimidator – if we're going to watch a film in which mismatched men acting like kids jabber on and on uncontrollably, either have Pesci do it to a much sinister-a degree or sideline him for the central pairing, because Getz's presence quickly wears thin. The plot about the Afrikaan cartel is nonsense, but of course it is; much like the techniques used by ""the best cops around"" when they consistently leave Getz by himself and no one bothers to guard Murtagh's house in spite of the fact he's already been hit there once by the enemy. With an uneven tone made possible by scenes of terrific violence and terror lined up beside more light hearted and more throwaway moments, not to mention a cackling chief villain at the centre of it whose reoccurring line is the roaringly amusing ""......dip-lur-mat-ic immu-ni-tie!"" said in that way only a South African could, Lethal Weapon 2 is the sequel to the film that was clinging on by its fingernail for a recommendation in the first place, and of which doesn't work.",Lethal Weapon 2
40,filipemanuelneto,"Shots, explosions, running, more explosions, Mel Gibson and Krugerrands.",3,15 September 2021,"I really liked the first movie of the franchise and was very curious to see the rest. So I had some expectations about this film, as is natural and understandable. But what I found is so much weaker that I couldn't avoid feeling disillusioned. Even so, it was a huge success and represented a huge financial income for everyone involved, from the studio to the actors. Mission accomplished!The problem starts where almost all problems start in cinema: the script, written in a fanciful and absurd way. Again, we'll see Murtaugh and Riggs in a new investigation, betting on eliminating an organized crime group that's strongly associated with South Africa, an ostracized country at this time due to the ""apartheid"". In the midst of all this, without even being immediately understood by the public, the detectives are removed from this case and are going to babysit an important witness. Understood? Not? In fact, it's hard to understand.In addition to a confusing script based on an absurd premise (the police cannot act against someone protected by diplomatic immunity... they can, but this requires contact with the diplomat's country, in order for immunity to be suspended), the film totally sacrifices the script for tons of unbelievable action filled with explosions, gunfire and destruction. The opening scene is pretty clear on what we're going to find, and the film's climax includes the destruction of an entire house by a single man. The movie is fun, entertains the audience, gives them a lot of action... but it doesn't make much sense.Again, Mel Gibson and Danny Glover showed up to the characters they had and give us a happy performance. Is it better than the first movie? No, I felt the two actors were lazier here, but the truth is that you only get to feel that once in a while. Joss Ackland was a more irritating villain than a threatening one, but he gives the franchise the first villain worth noting. Joe Pesci, unfortunately, was left with the painful and arduous task of bringing the movie moron to life, and his performance resented that.Technically, it's a movie where the bet goes completely back to special, visuals and sound effects. It is completely packed with action scenes, each one louder and more spectacular than the last, with explosions, gunfire, destruction and stunts doing a truly well-done and commendable job. The cinematography is regular, it is within what we would expect from a nineties film, and the sets and costumes fulfill their role with dignity. The soundtrack does not deserve any mention.",Lethal Weapon 2
41,leplatypus,Not the adult movie of your favorite pornstar (dad),7,25 August 2012,"Those two lethal weapons are rather Mel and Glover doing a sequel to their great cop duo. The recipe doesn't evolve a lot: nervous and dynamic action sequences mixed with comedy. The criminal case is always thin, anorexic but courageously puts the spotlight on the late racist state politic of Apartheid. The big feature here is the add-on of Pesci who plays a very talkative but sympathetic crook. The family life begins well with the episode of the advertising but it's a pity that the family disappears in the middle of the movie (and notice that since the beginning, the mother Darlene Love has never left the kitchen!). Kensit is a good pick for Mel's interest but it was useless to kill her, all the more that they shot an the alternative ending with her character still alive. In the same vein, it was stupid to mix Mel's deceased wife. In conclusion, it's a good movie but with sometimes clumsy spots.",Lethal Weapon 2

43,Movie_Muse_Reviews,More explosive and dramatic than the original,8,19 December 2008,"Danny Glover and Mel Gibson as cops Murtaugh and Riggs had enough chemistry in 1987's ""Lethal Weapon"" to generate more than four times the film's estimated budget that it easily green-lit a sequel. ""Lethal Weapon 2"" gives us further development of that relationship, but what you didn't necessarily expect was that the story and the action in the sequel would improve too. Well, Richard Donner and Joel Silver bring the heat once again in this sequel. It's just as witty and clever as the original and even more stuff explodes. The action even takes a turn from cool to serious as the bad guys (members of the South African consulate who use their diplomatic immunity to cover up their crimes) seem to be everywhere and taking everyone's life. You really don't like them at all. The film also deepens the humanity of Murtaugh and Riggs (specifically Riggs in this one) at the same time, which is pretty admirable for an action script back in the 1980s.The gunfire does get excessive at times and much like the original there's some crazy new scene unfolding around every corner with little lead in, but by some point in this film you just accept that as part of the Lethal Weapon universe--the bad guys are everywhere and there's always something going on. It really allows the film to pack in as much action as possible.Donner in the director's chair also deserves more accolades this time around. He simply gets how to weave action and drama by focusing on the characters a lot while also capturing the scope of the action sequences.Glover and Gibson really are a great tandem. They are both untypical for action heroes because they have such a wide range of emotions. They both joke around, take their jobs seriously at times, can be filled with hate or revenge and they truly know what's most important to them. Too many cops in films are one or two-dimensional but Shane Black's characters are not.Perhaps the only thing wrong with the film, other than it's odd racial undertones in tackling Apartheid South Africa, is that it forced writer Shane Black to walk away based on where Silver and Donner wanted to take their blooming franchise. Hard to argue with a gross more than double that of the original though.",Lethal Weapon 2

45,Anonymous_Maxine,Lethal Weapon II rekindles the excitement and action packed success generated by the original film two years earlier. Roger Murtaugh and Martin Riggs team up again for another great action film.,8,12 November 2000,"No time is wasted in the second installment in this now classic action series. Lethal Weapon II starts out immediately with a car chase, starting off what is to be a very entertaining film. Murtaugh and Riggs have the same personalities that they had before, and as is to be expected, they worked excellently on screen. Roger is the family man again, having major crises over the fact that his coming-of-age daughter has landed a spot in a condoms commercial (which he is teased about for the remainder of the movie), and Riggs is still the hyperactive cop with a few screws loose. Riggs now reveals that he has a talent for popping his shoulder in and out of its socket, one of the elements of the film that worked well as far as helping the story along, but that is just ridiculous in reference to real life situations. If you were wondering if a person could pop a dislocated shoulder back into place, painfully or otherwise, by smacking it on a wall or on the side of a car, I can pretty much assure you that it just doesn't work that way. It was funny to watch though, wasn't it?This is the installment where we are introduced to Leo Getz (played hilariously by Joe Pesci), who is the anxious but mostly unwelcome addition to Riggs' and Murtaugh's partnership. I think that they overloaded his mistreatment just a little too much for the film, Leo seemed to take entirely too much from Riggs and Murtaugh to keep cooperating with them. Nevertheless, this was still a great action film. In a memorable scene in Roger's bathroom involving a toilet bomb, he and Riggs are even able to successfully display an emotionally charged scene, even for this type of fast paced action film (in which almost any type of emotional involvement is usually clumsily thrown in to attract a larger audience (females) in true Jerry Bruckheimer form). And they even manage to jerk a few tears near the end in regards to Riggs' stunningly beautiful new girlfriend.As has become tradition in the Lethal Weapon series, there has to be at least one scene where just as the normal' police arrive, Riggs is staggering away from the destruction of a flaming crime scene breathlessly saying that everything is under control. This is done and overdone in the entire series, and it never seems to get tiring. The gunfights are great, the chases are better, and the action overall is excellently done by Richard Donner for the second time, but there were some things that just should have been left out or changed completely. For example, the helicopter shootout scene at Riggs' `house' was a little too excessive. It was too hard to believe that he and his girlfriend could have dodged THAT many bullets. It was cool to watch, but there's no way they could have avoided getting hit at least once. Also, I refuse to believe that ANY pick-up truck could have pulled the stilts out from under a house like it was done in the film. That was just too much. Even if some super-powerful pickup was ever able to do that, there's no way it could have gotten out of the way of the falling structure fast enough to avoid getting crushed by it.However, despite such disturbing weaknesses as these, Lethal Weapon II was a great movie. The things I mentioned above were badly unrealistic, and probably couldn't even be pulled off by a professional stunt team, but they worked really well with the story. The shootout scene with the helicopters created some good tension, regardless of how unrealistic it was. Also, with the kind of people who were in that house, you WANT to see the foundation pulled out from under them, and having Riggs do it not only fits perfectly with his personality, and it also almost makes you want to get up and cheer for him. This is a very good action film. It is virtually non-stop action from the opening scene, and it has a good ending, which is in my opinion one of the most important parts of any kind of movie. A bad ending can cancel out an otherwise good movie, and Lethal Weapon II is good from beginning to end. Excellent show.",Lethal Weapon 2
46,GOWBTW,"Great sequel, lots of comedy to go along with.",10,9 March 2006,"If you thought the first ""Lethal Weapon"" movie was something, well you haven't seen anything like this one. ""Lethal Weapon 2"" has got the action like the first one, yet there's a little more comedy to give some relief to it. Here you have Riggs(Mel Gibson) and Murtaugh(Danny Glover) who are at it again, with their shenanigans. Then enter Leo(Joe Pesci), a money launderer, and key witness, who life is at stake, and will do anything to help fight crime. When the South African crime lords who happen to be diplomats in L.A., Riggs and Murtaugh do their very best to stop them. When they attacked them, they don't realize they made a fatal error! They were responsible for the death of Riggs wife, that was the reason he was ""nuts"". Riggs should dislocating tricks was a major payoff for him, after the drug dealers try to weigh him down they killed Rika. Riggs got the revenge he deserved on those killers. And Murtaugh put their leader in his place by ""revoking his diplomatic immunity status"". Lots of gratitude is put into this movie. Richard Donner for making it, Danny Glover for his part of his crusade against apartheid in South Africa, Mel Gibson for bringing his character back into gear, and Joe Pesci for the comedy relief. A well made film! Rating 5 stars.",Lethal Weapon 2
47,FiendishDramaturgy,The honest truth about one of the most beloved action/comedy series in the movie industry.,9,16 October 2003,"THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS FOR ALL FOUR MOVIES!!1 - was fresh, innovative, edgy and hard. It had everything a good action movie needs to make it successful; excellent character development, imaginative direction, professional performances by the cast and crew, a clever and witty screenplay with intelligent dialog, and action...lots of good fast-paced, well-delivered action. It had a fresh comedic element without ever turning to camp or juvenile antics to solicit a chuckle from us. The comedy was educated, intelligent and expertly-delivered. The characters were lovable, and we got the feeling that we ""knew"" them, cared about them, wanted them to succeed. Riggs's character felt less like a character and more like a person, due to the high-level of development his character received. True, the ""gun handling"" left a lot to be desired, but the vast majority of audiences would not realize that you can not get 20 shots from a 16 shot clip. Nor would they realize that you can't just leave those empty clips on the ground; they cost MONEY and no CoP would do that because law enforcement officers are typically not highly paid. That aside, this was an excellent movie with wonderful entertainment value. One of the best of its kind.2 - gave us Joe Pesci's character, Leo Getz. Because of Getz, I honestly found this film to be rather endearing. Getz is one of the best characters to have been introduced to this series. Unfortunately, the edge and freshness is toned down way too much, and the action is really rather predictable. I thoroughly enjoyed bearing witness to the further development of the relationship between Riggs and Murtaugh, and was not in the least bored with that aspect. It is still a good movie, even though its edge is shelved for a more ""marketable"" product.3 - is just as good as 2. Riggs now has a new love interest and it seems as though all will be well and all manner of things will be well. It is still a few months away from the press release concerning the Glover/Gibson signing for 4 & 5, so it seems the series has wound down, rather than up. The action is still quality, though there are fewer and fewer unpredictable moments. The comedic aspect which was enlightened and intelligent is now a bit puerile and tired. And while the performances are still professional, it seems as though Riggs and Murtaugh both are well on their way out.4 - is the perfect ending to this series. Honestly. The characters have developed as far as I can bear to witness; Murtaugh misfires his gun in the locker room of the precinct, Riggs gets his butt kicked by a rookie cop in the boxing ring, and Riggs and Murtaugh are both just too old for this action thing anymore. (Gods help us with 60-something-year-old Harrison Ford in the upcoming ""Indiana Jones 4."") Their CHARACTERS speak constantly of being too old, and I'm not talking about Murtaugh's well used line, ""I'm getting too old for this sh*t."" It is far beyond that. And now, with Riggs's marriage to Lorna, Murtaugh's daughter's marriage to Butters, the new babies and all the smarmy crap at the ending...enough is just enough.5 - should never happen. I don't think I can bear to see anymore smarm from these two. The characters we all loved are already gone. Like in ""Invasion of the Bodysnatchers,"" they've been stolen from us. The edge from Riggs's character is gone. He's a bit hapless now, and sad rather than the lunatic mayhem we want and NEED from his character.The only way to pull off a 5th installment would be to kill off Lorna's character, the baby AND Butters. Either put Riggs back where his character was in 1 & 2, or don't bring him out of the moth balls. PLEASE. I loved these movies, but for the love of Mike! NO MORE!If you liked any of these movies, I highly recommend ""Tango & Cash,"" an excellent, much-overlooked, highly under-rated ""Buddy-Cop"" movie.1. 9.2/102. 8.8/103. 7.6/104. 6.8/10 from...the Fiend :.",Lethal Weapon 2
48,Captain_Couth,Revenge of the 80's: The Sequel.,3,18 August 2005,"Lethal Weapon 2 (1989) was a lame and useless sequel. Why was this made? To make more money! The first film was a surprise success. So a sequel was in order. What I hated about this movie was they changed the back ground story line. Riggs suddenly got younger but Murtaugh grew even older than he was in the first film. Riggs background was changed to suit the inane storyline.Like I said in the last comment. The series became more homo-erotic as the series continued. Another strike against the film are the cartoon villains. The only thing missing was them sporting thick mustaches and smoking big cigars. I hated this movie. The action scenes were over done and realism only mattered when it suited the story line. Adding characters and making overt and annoying political statements date this lame movie even further. While the first film was fun, this one blows chunks. I don't like it very much.Overrated garbage.",Lethal Weapon 2
49,generationofswine,An Honest Review,10,2 April 2017,"One of my friends parents rented ""Lethal Weapon 2"" when we were having a sleep over and actually called my parents to make sure it was OK that I watched it with them.I was shocked by the phone call.My father was shocked by the phone call. Of course I could, it's a children's movie...or at least back then it was kind of looked at as a kids flick.I mean, I had already seen it on the big screen with mom and dad.Anyway...this movie is about Leo.It was about Leo when I first watched it all those years ago and it's still about Leo today. 1, 3, and 4 are about Martin and Roger, but 2 was all about Leo.He stole the show and ran with it.All the parts you remember--before watching it again--are the Leo parts. The sort of physical three stooges routine he had with Riggs and how the duo treated him like a child.Something about South Africans and Leo, and Drugs and Leo, and Diplomatic Immunity and Leo, and a bomb on a toilet and Leo.Aside from the revocation of the Diplomatic Immunity and the toilet bomb, the movie is all Leo.And it is hysterical, not as dark as the first, and that's fine, because it's funnier.",Lethal Weapon 2
50,freemantle_uk,A very fun sequel,8,30 July 2010,"The 80s was a great period for action films, with hits like The Terminator, Predator, Aliens and Indiana Jones and the Raiders of the Lost Ark. It was also a period where the buddy cop genre growth with 48 Hours and the Beverly Hills Cop Series. Sequels too were becoming more popular, such as the Back to the Future trilogy, Mad Max series, the Karate Kid series and Indiana Jones trilogy being major examples. With Lethal Weapon being a hit in 1987 a sequel was commissioned, with Richard Donner, Mel Gibson, Danny Glover and Shane Black returning.Martin Riggs (Mel Gibson) and Roger Murtaugh (Danny Glover) are now friends and partners in the LAPD. There are on the case of foreign drug dealers importing heroin into the United States. But when Murtaugh and his wife are threaten their captain assign the two officers to protect Leo Getz (Joe Pesci), a loudmouth money launderer who has become a federal witness. Getz is targeted by the drug dealers Riggs and Murtaugh are thrust into action to arrest them. But there are South African diplomats lead by Arjen Rudd (Joss Ackland). There are protected by diplomatic immunity so our heroes have to come up with other means to stop the cartel.With the characters established in the first film, Donner was able to jump into the action straight and what better way is then a car chase in the middle of Los Andreas. Lethal Weapon 2 was also able to streamline the plot, forcing mostly on the battle of minds and weapons with the South Africans. There are not as many subplots, but the ones that are in the film do work. Donner keeps Lethal Weapon 2 going at a face pace, with plenty of action and tone wise the sequel is more light hearted and overtly humorous to it's predecessor. Most of the humour works, like when Murtaugh goes to the South African consulate pretended he wanted to emigrate to the Apartheid nation. There is also a running joke about Murtaugh's wife's new car repeatedly getting damaged because of the police wok. But there are a few scenes which try to be funny but do not add anything to the film, like when the cops and Getz argue about going through a drive through. Donner continues using traditional techniques for the action sequences, using stunt work and keeping the action real. It is also so good to actually see what is going on during a shoot-out or fight. The final fight scene between Gibson and Derrick O'Connor was better in this film then it was in Lethal Weapon because Donner used a lot of wide shots and used less cuts in the fight. Donner and his writers also find some interesting ways to kill people in rather humorous ways.Acting wise Lethal Weapon 2 was alright, Gibson and Glover has good chemistry together and now much more light hearted. Most of the other actors did a decent job, but Pesci's character was very annoying and he works best with Martin Scorsese and Robert De Niro. Some of the actors playing South Africans were also not able to master the accent, sounding more Australian/New Zealander, but that's a minor problem.However, a minor plothole in the film is if South African security forces started to kill American cops then you could imagine the response of the American government would have been.I found it very ironic that Gibson made fun of the South Africans for thinking there are the master race and calling one of them Adolf, considering we all now know his views on Black and Jewish people, women and homosexuals.A fun film.",Lethal Weapon 2
51,ianlouisiana,America's pot calling South Africa's kettle ..er...black.,4,15 July 2007,"Richard Donner shows off his liberal credentials with this ludicrously overcooked simplistic attack on the politics of South Africa.It's not as if America is the cradle of racial harmony and brotherly love - and further irony is added by the fact that the movie is set in the city that was the home of Rodney King and glorifies the Police Department that did so much towards community relations with their brutal racist behaviour. So Donner's salt and pepper pairing who clearly have a late = developing teenage crush on one another do their own thing with fine disregard for the rule of law or the rules of evidence and no one worries because the bad guys are white South Africans - surely a worrying example of police racism in itself? Inside Rudd's (Joss Ackland - eminently hissable) office the decor is designed and lit to resemble as far as possible the Fuhrerbunker and just in case some rather dumb moviegoers miss the point,he and his men are referred to as ""nazis"" at regular intervals. For me the only bright spot in the movie was when Mel Gibson turned up at an anti - apartheid demonstration carrying a banner bearing the inscription ""End Aparthied Now"". The intensely irritating Joe Pesci is introduced into the franchise to take some of the weight off the boys' shoulders by following them around yapping incessantly like a badly-trained puppy.This would be bearable if there was the remotest possibility of him ending up in a concrete overcoat,but sadly he survives to irritate another day. Miss Patsy Kensit seems in a world of her own,perhaps not believing her luck at being cast opposite Mel Gibson who has little trouble sweeping her into bed in his mobile home which appears to have been washed up on a beach somewhere.Shortly after consummating their affair they come under fire from a number of helicopters that fire enough rounds into Mel's caravan to keep the U.S. Army in Iraq going for six months. Fortunately he has a pet dog who is not afraid to cause coitus interruptus just as they are going for seconds and his barking warns them of the imminent attack.I hope he got a special bone as a reward. The film climaxes(without interruption from Mel's dog) on a cargo ship bound for Nazi Germany (sorry,South Africa),when Mel and Danny murder so many members of the master race that I lost count.Despite jiggling around like Bonnie and Clyde under the impact of a hail of bullets,Mel survives,curled up in his partner's arms like a small child with a wise and benevolent father.Take that,Apartheid!",Lethal Weapon 2
52,dee.reid,"Best of the series after 4, of course",10,14 November 2000,"I like Lethal Weapon 2 for three reasons: the action, the laughs, and the last and most important reason is it delivers a powerful message.  The first reason I like Lethal Weapon 2 is because it's full of action.  From the opening chase scene to the destruction of the stilt house to the final shootout, nonstop action.  Reason #2: The laughs.  Joe Pesci adds what I think is some much needed comic humor.  As some reviews have said, Joe Pesci is sort of a third stooge in this film.  Reason #3 and the most important: Lethal Weapon delivers a very powerful message. Now I'm 15 and I'm black.  I was 12 when I saw this film for the first time.  I admit I didn't understand all that stuff about racism and apartheid and the problems facing South Africa but now I do.

53,jimbo-53-186511,Not as lethal as the first film,5,29 October 2013,"I'll be honest and say that I wasn't overly impressed with the first film. I found it to be watchable and fairly enjoyable, but it wasn't what I would call 'fantastic'. In this second film, there were a number of problems which (for me) made this film merely 'average'. The opening 10-15 minutes were great and I really thought I was in for an exciting sequel, but after this opening sequence the film just seems to plod along and fails to keep up the momentum.For me, I just didn't find the plot of this film to be particularly engaging; South African diplomats using their immunity to engage in criminal activities. The leader of the South African diplomats is Arjen Rudd (Joss Ackland)- whilst Ackland's acting was fairly good, I found him to be a fairly forgettable villain. There was also a distinct lack of character development in this second film. In this second film, we are introduced to Leo Getz (Joe Pesci) who is a witness which Riggs and Murtagh are assigned to 'protect' before he testifies at a trial. However, complications ensue when it turns out that Getz has been dealing with the South African diplomats and confesses to stealing a large amount of cash from them.In addition to the rather weak plot, I also found a few implausible scenarios (Riggs managed to pull a building down with his truck, Riggs managing to shoot a villain in a helicopter from long range in the pitch black). The first film was a bit silly, but this film felt ridiculous at times rather than silly.The good thing about this second film is that the chemistry was still good between Riggs and Murtagh. I also felt that Leo Getz was a great addition to the film (although he was clearly introduced more for comic relief than anything else). Pesci is a great actor, but I felt that the writers let him down here as his character's dialogue was repetitive and at times it did get a bit tedious.This is a tough one for me as all the ingredients from the first film are there; humour, good chemistry between the leads. However, it's let down by a weak plot and at times I felt somewhat bored (which is not something that I can say about the first film). To sum up, Lethal Weapon isn't a complete disaster, but it's definitely not as good as the first film.",Lethal Weapon 2

Unfortunately there's so many big action scenes here that it loses a bit of its charm, heading into over-the-top territory. Joe Pesci's character didn't help either, and I found his interaction, as the third wheel with Riggs and Murtaugh extremely annoying. Thankfully the plot moves along at a supercharged rate and he gets overshadowed.Still this is better than a lot of sequels, as LA detective Riggs (Mel Gibson) and Murtaugh (Danny Glover) reprise their roles and chemistry this time battling a vicious South African drug cartel.I also enjoyed the quieter side here and seeing how Martin's relationship (and mental status) had progressed, in particular in his scenes with Rogers wife and family.

And even though ""Lethal Weapon 2"" lacks a little humour, it is more than made up for by its frenetic pace (if that is any compensation). Fun to watch!Saturday, August 22, 1992 - Video",Lethal Weapon 2
61,rbverhoef,Comes very close to the original,7,21 February 2004,"The sequel to 'Lethal Weapon' is as entertaining as the first and the only things it lacks is the originality we saw in the original 'Lethal Weapon'. Now we already know how Martin Riggs (Mel Gibson) and Roger Murtaugh (Danny Glover) are but when two characters are this much fun together that doesn't really matter.This time they have to face South African diplomats, in a year where Nelson Mandela had not leave his island yet. I could tell you more about the story, but story is not really the issue here. Not that it is bad, it is actually pretty good, but it is mainly there for great action sequences and perfect moments of comedy. The scene where the black Murtaugh is trying to move to South Africa is hilarious.The movie gives us to things that makes the movie different from the first. The first is a love interest named Rika (Patsy Kensit) who works, in the innocent way, for the South African diplomats. The second is Leo Getz (Joe Pesci). He is a key witness and Riggs and Murtaugh must make sure nothing happens to him. Instead of doing that they take him on their missions. Pesci is great in his role.Besides that things are familiar, but done so good that it feels fresh. This is a sequel that really lives up to the original movie and that alone is something to appreciate.",Lethal Weapon 2
62,valleyjohn,More of the same from Gibson and Glover,8,27 June 2020,"I was wondering if the Lethal Weapon sequel would hold up quite as well as it's predecessor and it does . In fact it's probably slightly better .South African smugglers find themselves being hounded and harassed by Riggs and Murtaugh. However, the South Africans are protected by diplomatic immunity, and so the two are assigned to witness-protection duty in an attempt by their captain to keep his job.In this we get the madness , the violence and the humour ramped up a notch and overall it's a lot of fun .Joe Pesci stars in it although it feels that his character is shoe horned into the story just to put a big name in the film .This has the famous sex scene with Gibson and Patsy Kensit who later said she felt very uncomfortable as they were both married . It looked ok to me !Some of the accents were awful . God knows what the South Africans thought of them , because to me they were terrible . Especially Kensit's.You have to laughs at some of the stuff Riggs says to the South Africans about them being racist . That would come back to haunt him !There was criticism that Riggs should have died in the end but this made over $250 Million so you can see why the producers wanted to keep him alive for what would eventually be two more films .",Lethal Weapon 2
63,masonsaul,Just as good as the original,10,25 July 2019,"Lethal Weapon 2 has the amazing action, car chases, fast pace, humour and chemistry that made the original so good, therefore making it a sequel just as good as the original. Danny Glover and Mel Gibson once again give incredible performances as well as Joe Pesci, who is great. The music by Michael Kamen, David Sandborn and Eric Clapton is fantastic. Richard Donner's direction is also great. The film also has a good balance between the action, humour and emotion.",Lethal Weapon 2

There are very few that can keep the magic of the original going.The difference here is Mel Gibson (Martin Riggs) and Danny Glover (Sergeant Roger Murtaugh). They are perfect partners and can keep it going forever; or one would hope so.Joe Pesci is added as Leo Getz (Whatever you need, Leo Getz. Get it?) He is a perfect set up man to the antics of Riggs and Murtaugh.And, this movie feature people you really want to hate as the bad guys. I mean who can possibly be more sinister and sleazy than Africaners? Arjen Rudd (Joss Ackland) is outstanding in the role of the man you most want to see get a bullet in his head. And, Vorstedt (Derrick O'Conner)? He has his own nasty secret which makes him Public Enemy #1. His dance with Riggs at the end is movie magic.We would be remiss if we did not mention the incredibly luscious Patsy Kensit as Rika, Rudd's secretary, who only wants to stay in America. Da da da da da da da da, Detective Riggs to the rescue! Who could blame him? Humor, action, romance, tragedy, evil villains, and good friends. this is what movies are made of.",Lethal Weapon 2
65,PredragReviews,"They're back, they're bad. He's black, he's mad.",9,6 April 2017,"As much as Lethal Weapon may have stepped outside its genre trappings to strike an unexpected chord, its sequel was the film that gave the series the legs it needed to continue onward and upward. While it still plumbs some dark, painful subject matter for its lead characters, Lethal Weapon 2 skews lighter by treating the Murtaugh-Riggs dynamic as the stuff of fruitful comedy, an approach intensified by the slightly annoying, but still faithfully endearing, Leo Getz character, whom Joe Pesci makes all his own.But it's the supreme comfort of Mel Gibson and Danny Glover, with both each other and the script that rockets this to the top of buddy movies to such an extent that it became ripe for parody. The director again proves his command of this material with a handful of memorable scenes, and especially his use of Gibson in his trademark ""lethal weapon"" scenes, which coined the franchise title. Even though Gibson is a lot less depressed in this film you still completely believe him as a guy that has nothing to lose.It's fair to say that this is Gibson's movie, because it's written that way. Some of Riggs' back story is filled in and he even gets a love interest in the slender form of Patsy Kensit. Riggs cracks the jokes and does the outrageous mental stuff, while Glover's (still doing fine work in Gibson's shadow) Murtaugh continues to be the counter opposite. Tho some of the astute written sequences involving Murtaugh and the South African core of the story are excellently handled by Glover. But regardless of character development and nifty political observations, it's the action that dominates proceedings. Director Richard Donner has a wail of a time putting the cast thru their paces. There's explosions, fights, shoot-outs, more high speed pursuits, and on it goes till we get to the finale, a potential cliffhanger one too.Overall rating: 9 out of 10.",Lethal Weapon 2
66,eric262003,"Good, But Original Was Better",7,7 September 2009,"In keeping up the tradition of the original ""Lethal Weapon"", the sequel still continues the time-honoured tradition to providing the the action, the humour, and the thrills that made ""Lethal Weapon I"" one of the best buddy-cop movies in the history of cinema. The chemistry between Riggs (Mel Gibson) and Murtaugh (Danny Glover)is still remarkable. The only thing now is that Riggs is less self-destructive as he was in the first movie, but I guess it's so that in the first he tries to get over the loss of his wife and he somehow has moved on. Not as exciting as the first, but still very believable. Some historical-political elements that provides some surprising educational facts are delivered here in the movie that's obscurely mentioned in classrooms. Here it takes aim the the South African apartheid fiasco that ran from 1948, up until 1994 by Nelson Mandela who over-turned the government and became President of South Africa putting a stop to apartheid. During it's dying stages, the government provided segregated communities to it diverse ethnics and tried to promote theocracy. The South Africans depicted may have been over the top, but the political upheaval was executed immaculately. In spite of that cultural reference, there's a setback to it as well. I don't understand why did the South Africans killed Riggs' wife and now have targeted his girlfriend. What's up with that? The whole logic was completely null and void and has no logic to it at all. Some editing should have been taken to consideration. It's still an enjoyable film, but the first one stands above them all.",Lethal Weapon 2
67,vengeance20,Bigger & Badder!,9,21 August 2021,"So with the first classic film follows Lethal Weapon 2! This one I found to be a slash better than it's predecessor!This time around Riggs & Murtaugh, now warmed to each other, are to take down a group of South African diplomats who are using their immunity to engage in criminal activities.I found the film to be somewhat better than the first! More comedy, more of an elaborated story concerning the death of Riggs' wife & not to mention more action with bigger, badder stunts than before! The story seems to be a bit better too, with a more interesting villain this time around, again with a more elaborated story & connection to Riggs' character! Leo Getz is a great addition & really adds a good amount of comedy in between the already great banter between Riggs & Murtaugh! The eye-candy addition to this film is great with Rika! Babe!Overall, this is a solid & slightly better sequel to the 1987 original!9/10.",Lethal Weapon 2
68,philip_vanderveken,Still one of the better action comedies,7,31 January 2005,"Normally I don't like sequels because most of the time it seems like the writers have lost all inspiration and are simply looking for an easy way to make more money. This time however I have to admit that I had a good time watching this movie. I know, it isn't even trying to be original, but it sure has plenty of the same kind humor and action to offer as we saw in the first movie.This time Martin Riggs (Mel Gibson) and Roger Murtaugh (Danny Glover) are chasing a gang of South African diplomats, who also work as smugglers. Because their superior wants to protect them, he assigns them to a witness protection project. They have to protect Leo Getz, a money laundering loud mouth who has decided to help the justice department. But in stead of sticking to their assignment, they still try to catch the South Africans.What you get is the same kind of humor and action that you probably saw during the first movie. The acting is good and I really had to laugh with it several times. However, if you weren't a fan of the first movie, than I'm sure that you won't like this one either. Personally I find it one of the better action movies / action comedies that I've seen lately. That's why I give it something between a 7/10 and a 7.5/10.",Lethal Weapon 2

The duo have to fight for their right to fight back, as the criminals declare war on the cops, and arouse the lethal weapon in Riggs.The introdction of Joe Pesci's character is a little annoying at first but it soon grows on you and he adds a focus for the comedy element.Richard Donner again directs the cop duo and again we have a movie well worth watching.Plenty of action, a few more laughs and a lethal weapon that is still just as sharp, all combine to deliver another great outing for Riggs and Murtaugh.8/10",Lethal Weapon 2
70,Howlin Wolf,The magic is back!,6,29 July 2007,"... and there's just enough moments of wonderment in this one to keep me amused.It's certainly not a retread of the first, which is good in a way I suppose, but there are odd moments where it just doesn't feel like a Lethal Weapon movie and seems to be modelling itself on more traditional and straightforward action movies, instead. Only in the last 20 minutes does Riggs recapture the edge to his character that I thrive on when I watch the original. I like Joss Ackland as an actor and he's a steely villain but he's not particularly threatening - the film treats his death almost like an afterthought; plus the addition of a 'lovable comedy sidekick' further dilutes the tension in a way that I don't think was necessary. Mel Gibson is funny enough as Riggs on his own, someone else to make us laugh wasn't needed, I felt.On the plus side, Derrick O'connor almost singlehandedly restores the menace as henchman Vorstedt, who for me is easily the best baddie of the entire series. He has a great climactic fight with Riggs which is appropriately brutal. Watching it makes me nostalgic for the days when our hero knew how to handle himself in a scrap even with a knife in the leg, and didn't get his behind handed to him by Jet Li... *sigh*There are some great individual scenes that definitely still make this worth watching, but as a sequel I prefer the third entry, where the elements of the story seem to fit better and everything doesn't feel quite so fragmented.",Lethal Weapon 2
71,rivertam26,Solid sequel,8,5 January 2020,"I'm a big fan of the Leathal Weapon franchise and for some odd reason I just couldn't remember the second film and I thought that maybe had to do with the quality of it. Well I'm happy to say I was wrong because this is an awesome movie. The partnership between a wild and very hunky Mel Gibson and a charming if slightly stereotypical Danny Glover is fantastic, their chemistry is really why the film works so well. This time around the duo find themselves against some south African money launderers and just all around bad guys. It ties perfectly into the first like a great sequel does and extends the storyline. Although not as intense as the original I really like the Riggs love interest and was quite moved by the emotionally resonant aspect overall. The action sequences are of course top notch and edge of your seat as are the barrage of comical but clever one liners. All in all the movie works surprisingly well and with the addition of Joe Pesci in a wonderfully fun comic form makes it all even more entertaining.",Lethal Weapon 2
72,Analog_Devotee,CLASSIC SEQUEL!,8,5 July 2021,"Another one of those 80s sequels that insists upon a double-feature. What do you mean you don't have time?

73,oneguyrambling,So what if it's the same as the first. I would have thought that a good thing...,7,23 July 2011,"I think the director of the Lethal Weapon series Richard Donner coined the phrase 'if it ain't broke, don't fix it'. Even if that is not the case it is definitely his personal motto.Lethal Weapon 2 is a very efficient replica of the original, so much so that I am willing to grant it ""Great"" status even though precious little has changed. Lethal Weapon 2 might be the same as the first, but when they are both equally entertaining you can forgive that, and this film might have the same ratio of action to comedy but here the jokes are funnier and more of them hit the mark.After Lethal Weapon 2 opens with a kick-ass car chase that serves to both get the adrenalin pumping, and reminds us that Riggs (Mel Gibson) is the crazy one and Murtaugh (Danny Glover) the more staid one who is 'too old for this sh*t"" and about to retire... still.We learn quickly that the new foe are a nasty South African crime group with management in high places, and half the things said or seen in the early stages serve as omens for the final 40 minutes or so.The boys are also given another task in this film and have to babysit a diminutive, motor-mouthed money launderer named Leo Getz (Joe Pesci) who has luck would have it has ties with the very same South African gang that Riggs and Murtaugh are after. Leo's ""OK, OK, OK"" jabber is amusing and annoying in equal proportion, so thankfully Leo gets more a bit part than a supporting role.All Lethal Weapons have great setpieces and action sequences, but this film is remembered for three things:The exploding toilet scene - ""DIPLOMATIC IMMUNITY!"" - Mel and hottie South African secretary Rika getting' it onnnnnn.The fact that South Africa was right in the middle of apartheid when this film was released added a new wrinkle for the pair, obviously Roger, and made shooting white people cool again.Of course both Riggs and Murtaugh get their own personal nemesis to deal with and everyone nearly dies multiple times, but only those with less than 4 lines of dialogue actually bite the dust.Lethal Weapon 2 shouldn't work but thanks to the chemistry between the two leads, the efficiency of the action and the ""just right"" blend of action and comedy, you'll go a long way before you see a sequel as good as Lethal Weapon 2.Final Rating - 8.5 / 10. I didn't want to label this as Great but it's just so damn fast paced, funny and entertaining that I had no alternative.",Lethal Weapon 2
74,mentalcritic,A worthy sequel,7,18 March 2005,"Sequels have a mostly bad reputation in the Hollywood system, with many a screenwriter believing that simply repeating previous work will be sufficient. There's also a small group of sequels that build on and so improve upon the original. Lethal Weapon 2 falls into a third category. It is neither better nor worse than the original. As Tommy Chong would say, it is basically the same thing, only different. Given that the original was a stunning example of how much better action films were when the MPAA had not yet decided that films had to be suitable only for children, this is certainly good enough for the discerning viewer.Lethal Weapon 2's principal difference from the original is that the lead character, Riggs, is played with a more light-hearted, even gentle tone for the most part. It is not until the final act, when the links with the original are properly resolved, that the angry, violent Riggs we saw in the original Lethal Weapon comes back to say hello. Unlike what happened in the latter two sequels, Lethal Weapon 2 does not take the lighter side of Riggs too far. Instead, Riggs is a very human character with more than two dimensions, a fact that was especially missed in Lethal Weapon 4. Even the introduction of a romantic interest, played with aplomb by Patsy Kensit, works wonderfully because of these all-important depths to Riggs' character.The biggest problem with Lethal Weapon 2 comes in the form of Joe Pesci. This is not so much Pesci's fault, as he is a very capable actor. The problem is that his character is as one-dimensional as most of those that populate the next two Lethal Weapons. By the time we are finished with his introduction, we are just about ready to feed him to a paper shredder. Fortunately, the acting skills of Danny Glover and Mel Gibson give Pesci something to bounce his rather flat material from. But the real surprise here is the quality of the antagonists.It is a well-known law in action films, or indeed many a genre, that your protagonist can only be as strong as your antagonist. Derrick O'Connor and Joss Ackland are two of the best antagonists that have been depicted on film. So much so that they manage to overcome the anti-apartheid message we are often beaten over the head with during much of the film. Director Richard Donner's tendency to push a political ideal in his films often works to the detriment of his films, so it is a testament to the strength of these two actors' performances that the film works so well. The viewer loves to hate them, and they truly seem to enjoy earning it.In all, I gave Lethal Weapon 2 a seven out of ten. It isn't the most brilliant film you will ever see, but it sustains multiple viewings quite well. And let's be honest here. Where else can you see men riding on the front of speeding cars or being killed with surfboards?",Lethal Weapon 2
75,Karl Self,Even more lethaler!,6,27 December 2008,"The sequel offers more comedy (great buddy action between Riggs and Murtaugh, with Joe Pesci coming in as brilliant comedic sidekick Leo Getz, okayokayokay ...) and more over-the-top action, and even less of a coherent plot. While Riggs was an ambivalent and unhinged guy in the first part, he's more like the Australian answer to Bruce Lee and James Bond rolled into one here (hordes of villains keep attacking him with nuclear weapons -- Riggs wards them all off with his trusty Beretta and the occasional roundhouse kick) -- which unfortunately also makes him a lot less intriguing.I would really have preferred a less ludicrous and more ""together"" plot. I thought it was a nice touch to throw in a bit of current politics and to give the South Africans (then still a racist régime) a hard time, but the movie goes way over the top here in painting them Blofeld-evil and likening them to the Nazis. It's just silly and schematic. Riggs repeatedly busts this one fat South African guy murdering babies and stuffing them with drugs, to which the insidious Kaffir-hater will always retort by claiming diplomatic immunity.Overall, this franchise lingers under the he usual weakness of the plot and narration department, but is still often enjoyable. It's one of those movies which is fun to watch, then afterwards there is this uncomfortable phase where you unsuccessfully try to make sense of the plot, and then you forget the whole movie quite quickly.",Lethal Weapon 2
76,Beta_Gallinger,A thrilling and often humorous sequel,7,30 July 2009,"""Lethal Weapon"", a successful action blockbuster from 1987 starring Mel Gibson and Danny Glover, spawned a total of three sequels. This one, ""Lethal Weapon 2"", released in 1989, was obviously the first of those three. I saw the original ""Lethal Weapon"" for the first time just three months ago. I was less than a year old when that one was released, and just under three years old when this first sequel came into theatres. Since they're R-rated movies, I obviously wouldn't be seeing them anytime soon. I was unaware of the existence of the entire series until sometime within the past couple years. However, as I expected, I was impressed with the first one when I saw it this year. I wasn't expecting this one to be as good, but still had reasonable expectations, and wasn't disappointed.As Sergeant Martin Riggs and Sergeant Roger Murtaugh of the L.A.P.D. chase after a criminal in a red BMW, it crashes. They go to arrest the driver, but find out he has escaped. Riggs and Murtaugh search the car, and discover that the trunk is filled with Krugerrands, South African gold coins! After Murtaugh is threatened in his bedroom by a group of South African thugs, who warn him to stop the investigation, the two L.A.P.D. officers are assigned to protect Leo Getz, a witness in a drug case who will soon testify! They learn that this man has been doing business with South African drug smugglers, a group lead by Arjen Rudd! Rudd is the one Riggs and Murtaugh are after, but unfortunately, he is the minister of diplomatic affairs for the South African Consulate! He and his organization are diplomatically immune, meaning it will be hard to arrest them! Like the original, ""Lethal Weapon 2"" features a good amount of action, suspense, and humour. The film starts off humorously with the car chase, showing the two main characters with a very different attitude towards it. After that, a lot more humour follows, with Riggs and Murtaugh's awkward relationship. Joe Pesci plays the goofy Leo Getz, a comical character who also amused me. I laughed quite a bit during the film, and also found myself in suspense many times, with the two heroes in pursuit of the dangerous criminals! The part with Murtaugh stuck on a booby-trapped toilet is good for both suspense AND laughs. The two stars, Gibson and Glover, made a good pair in the original 1987 blockbuster, and do it once again here. This sequel may not be quite as consistent as its predecessor, but at least it comes close. The biggest problem I have with this second installment is that it seemed a tad overlong to me, but apart from that, there's not much I can complain about.",Lethal Weapon 2
77,fmarkland32,Revoking the visa...,10,8 January 2007,"This time our favorite mismatched cops (Mel Gibson and Danny Glover) take on South African diplomats (who I think are German) who are taking advantage of the system by using their status to deal drugs, after numerous warnings from the dealers, as well as near death experiences, our favorite two cops go out with all pistols blazing in a thrilling climax which ends in explosive fashion. I think the main reason why in 1989, I couldn't enjoy the ultra-lame Tango And Cash which came out that year (though at the end of the year) was because I had seen this earlier and this to me was the real thing. Lethal Weapon 2 is one of those movies that still manages to entertain years after its release. I saw this as a teenager and thought it was the greatest thing ever and even now this is one of my most prized DVDs in my collection. Lethal Weapon 2 is a very exciting movie and when I look at other enjoyable movies that fall in the mismatched buddy/cop genre (Lethal Weapon 1, I Come In Peace, Beverly Hills Cop 1+2, Last Boyscout and Rush Hour) Lethal Weapon 2 always stands head and shoulders above the rest, indeed it is tied with 48 HRS as my favorite Cop/Buddy movie off all time. I think the thing that gives this movie that extra enjoyment is that we actually care about characters, the acting is very well done and overall it's directed with a brutal punch which back up the action. Also Joe Pesci's comic relief wasn't annoying (like it would be in the later sequels) in fact his comic timing actually works. This is a great example of genre film-making and is a must see for fans of the genre.* * * * out of 4-(Excellent, a must see!)",Lethal Weapon 2
78,jhclues,Gibson And Glover Are Back!,9,26 November 2000,"The tone is a bit lighter, but the `lethal' action continues unabated and non-stop as two of L.A.P.D.'s finest go after a South African consulate, dirty up to his neck in drugs and hiding behind diplomatic immunity in `Lethal Weapon 2,' directed by Richard Donner and once again starring Mel Gibson and Danny Glover.  Still crazy, but no longer suicidal, Riggs (Gibson) continues to hunt down the bad guys with partner Roger Murtaugh (Glover), and this time around they find their lives in danger when they get too close to the underhanded dealings of South African Arjen `Aryan' Rudd (Joss Ackland) and his band of thugs.  Along the way, they're assigned to baby-sit an informant in a money laundering racket, Leo Getz (Joe Pesci); and Riggs at last finds someone, Rika Van Den Haas (Patsy Kensit), who helps ease the pain of his wife's death, while also discovering who was responsible for the automobile accident that took her life. 	As he did with the first `Lethal Weapon,' Donner keeps it all moving along at a brisk pace, though he allows the intensity level to drop somewhat this time while infusing more humor.  There's some `Stooges' on hand, and a bit that finds Murtaugh the target of some office gags after the debut of a television commercial, starring his daughter, Rianne (Traci Wolfe), for a product that takes him by surprise, but the real laughs come courtesy of Pesci, who's upbeat, manic characterization of Getz becomes a real scene stealer.  Though serious at the core, this movie is more of a joy ride than the first, though there are moments of true menace and apprehension, as well as a sobering resolution involving one of the featured characters. 	Performance wise, Gibson is as charismatic as ever, by now settling comfortably into Riggs' skin while further exploring the more intricate details of the character's personality.  Glover, too, manages to take Murtaugh to the next level, leaving no doubt as to who this guy is and what he's about, from his dedication to the job, to his even more stringent dedication to his family.  And, most importantly, these two really click as a team, and Donner knows just how to bring out the best in them.  What really raises the bar in this second installment, however, is the addition of Pesci, who makes Leo Getz a truly memorable character.  Inserting him into the mix was a real stroke of genius, and Donner wisely uses him just enough to effectively lighten the mood and counteract the drama. 	The supporting cast includes Darlene Love (Trish), Derrick O'Connor (Adolph), Steve Kahan (Capt. Murphy), Mark Rolston (Hans) and Jenette Goldstein (Officer Meagan Shapiro).  With snappy dialogue, plenty of action and some good guys to root for, `Lethal Weapon 2' is a thoroughly entertaining sequel that more than does justice to the original.  Donner knows his territory, and his stars know their stuff and how to deliver it, and that's a `lethal' combination any way you look at it.  And what's even more gratifying, is knowing that they didn't stop here; after all the action of the first two, you know there's another one waiting for you.  At this point, do not pass go, do not collect two hundred dollars; `Lethal Weapon 3' is available, and it's yours for the asking.  I rate this one 9/10.",Lethal Weapon 2

In addition, if you're not able to take the second sequel of a buddy cop action movie in the ""Lethal Weapon"" series, ignore this review, as well. We'll both be better off.Lethal Weapon 2 (1989) is one of the greatest action films of all time! Mel Gibson's performance as sergeant Martin Riggs is fantastic as well. This is a great must see movie! Martin Riggs becomes a bad ass in this movie, when his woman is killed. And also the movie gives more back story on how Riggs wife died from the first movie. I love this sequel but I have always enjoyed Lethal Weapon 3 much more than I did have enjoyed this one, but still a good awesome flick. I an a lot of opinions it is better than 3 & 4. It is my third favorite sequel in Lethal Weapon trilogy and I have enjoy Lethal Weapon 3 much more than I did 2. I love this sequel the same that I love 1 and 3, but 2 is one grade lover for me than 1 & 3.In the year of the Batman, Lethal Weapon 2 brought back Riggs and Murtaugh for the summer of '89. Man what a jammed packed summer that was. Lethal Weapon 2 lost it's darker tone but amped up the action elements and tossed in Joe Pesci (who was lost in cinema oblivion) until his turn in this movie, plus my cousin Vinny and eventually Home Alone and Goodfellas. His performance as Leo Getz introduces the comic relief that would go on through the next two movies. Lethal Weapon 2 offers up a fun ride with old friends an deeps the trust we have with Mel and Danny. They truly make a great cinematic team. Lethal Weapon 2 is the second installment in the Lethal Weapon film franchise. Mel Gibson and Danny Glover returns as Detectives Martin Riggs and Roger Murtaugh, who find themselves assigned to protect an accountant (Joe Pesci) whose testimony involves a large money laundering conspiracy that involves South African diplomats during the time of apartheid.Mel Gibson, Danny Glover, Patsy Kensit, Joss Ackland, Jenette Goldstein, Derrick O'Connor and Dean Norris did a terrific outstanding job portraying their characters. In the first movie there were drug smugglers, former Vietnam vets of a Shadow Company, this time they are South African diplomats who are smuggling drugs, weapons and gold coins from South Africa. I love the opening scenes that are in the middle of a car chase through the 4th Street tunnel in downtown Los Angeles. Martin Riggs (Mel Gibson) and Roger Murtaugh (Danny Glover), partners in the LAPD's homicide division, are in pursuit of a red BMW, while their colleagues are converging on the car from the opposite direction. It's a suspected drug bust. Riggs kicks it open and hundreds of South African krugerrands (gold coins which were illegal in the U. S. at the time due to the South African apartheid government), come spilling out. Murtaugh and Riggs head for the docks in search of the cargo ship, the Alba Varden. Murtaugh tells Riggs that it's scheduled to sail for South Africa. They find the ship and see three men standing near a container waiting to be loaded onto the ship. They ambush the men and take their weapons, then break into the container to investigate. Inside, they find Rudd's Mercedes sedan and numerous pallets piled high in shrink wrapped United States currency, in multiple denominations.The last showdown in the docks on the ship was pure action scenes and action sequences. The gun play was delivered with a lot of weapons. There was a lot of action scenes. (At one point Riggs fires his Beretta 92FS at an attacking helicopter and kills one of the henchman's.) Riggs (Mel Gibson) fires back at Rudd's henchmen atop his mobile home with a Heckler & Koch MP5A3. I have enjoyed the second movie a lot and the action sequences I still love this movie, I always love watching it and I just love all Lethal Weapons movies. I am giving this movie a 9 tough I gave Lethal Weapon 1 & 3 a 10, this movie deserves a 9, because I didn't like the scene ""It's just been revoked!"" Closeup of Murtaugh's Smith & Wesson Model 19 the moment before Murtaugh fires on Arjen Rudd (Joss Ackland)in the head, when his gun was empty and the guy shows his South African diplomatic I. D. I don't like that scene and I think what Murtaugh did was just wrong in my opinion I am sorry. I am wondering what happened too Patsy Kensit? I have never seen her any other film role or on any other movie anymore.Lethal Weapon 2 is a 1989 American buddy cop action film directed by Richard Donner, and starring Mel Gibson, Danny Glover, Joe Pesci , Patsy Kensit, Derrick O'Connor and Joss Ackland.

81,fernandoschiavi,"This second part shows an increase in the scale of production, more construction for action set pieces and even more humor",8,29 August 2020,"With the resounding success of the first film, the sequel to the story of police officers Murtaugh and Riggs comes just two years after the original film. Again directed by Richard Donner, scripted by Jeffrey Boam, based on the story of Shane Black and Warren Murphy, this second part shows an increase in the scale of production in relation to the first film, this initial scene also makes clear the proposal of the sequence: that of come out as a comedy. The more serious side of the original, especially with regard to Riggs' personal conflicts - the trauma of his wife's death and his suicidal tendencies - is softened, appearing only as motivation for the character at key moments. The bet is really on the comic potential of the dynamic between Gibson and Glover, which works perfectly.Martin Riggs (Mel Gibson) and Roger Murtaugh (Danny Glover) are two policemen who work together to fight a drug dealer. The duo is charged with protecting Leo Getz (Joe Pesci), a witness who admits to doing business with South Africans. They discover that a member of the South African diplomatic corps is using his immunity to be able to commit his crimes.In the form, we see changes too. The first was about the two getting to know each other and learning to dance together. In the second the relationship of the two is already established and the film can no longer be about it. So it turns on the story itself. And there is an additional one, Joe Pesci, that brings humor and relaxation. Another significant change is the structure of the story itself, which at first started out slow and developed little by little. The second film already begins with a frantic chase by the good guys behind the thug, who works for another major thug, which is related to a snitch that they have to protect while the FBI does not take over the investigation.Murtaugh remains the most conscious side of the pair, dreaming of his retirement, while Riggs continues with his explosive and unpredictable temper. But the time of living together makes them understand each other better, overcoming their old difficulties to work with a partner. In the second Lethal weapon we are presented with a very different dynamic from the one we saw in the first film. Especially between the two main characters, Riggs and Murtaugh, who already have chemistry from old friends and are already fighting and playing like an old couple. Riggs is already so used to his partner that he is practically a household member, having his clothes washed and his medicines organized by his colleague's wife. He became a family member, is an uncle and brother-in-law. The interaction with Murtaugh's family core plays an important role in the story and is also used for comic purposes, such as generating the jokes that Riggs and the entire police team make with the character of Glover, another brand of the franchise. In the case of Lethal weapon 2, the games come about as a result of a condom commercial starring Rianne (Traci Wolfe), the eldest daughter of the detective. The provocations between Riggs and the police psychologist (Mary Ellen Trainor) are another element that gains more space in this continuation.Here we still see other moments that have become emblematic within the series, such as when Riggs dislocates his shoulder to get rid of a straitjacket - a skill explored on later occasions - the attack on the trailer on the beach or the scene where a bomb is placed on toilet in Murtaugh's house. In addition, the film features a character who would return in chapters 3 and 4: Leo Getz (Joe Pesci), a small criminal who becomes a witness, under the protection of the protagonists, and is pursued precisely by the South African gang. Shortly before taking his supporting actor Oscar for The Good Companions (1990), Pesci was already building a talkative type - albeit a personality completely opposed to the gangster in the Scorsese film - always straddling the boundary between the funny and the irritating, both for both the public and Riggs and Murtaugh.
Right at the beginning of ""Lethal weapon 2"", the viewer can already see that the main characteristics of the first film were maintained in this sequence, through the mind-boggling car chase through the city. Again, Riggs is agitated and unafraid of death and Roger is more concerned about his family than anything else. The exciting chase also serves to confirm the good technical work of the team led by Richard Donner, starting with the excellent editing by Stuart Baird - who keeps the scene in a frenetic pace - and the beautiful sound and sound effects work, which he captures with precision the noise of vehicles at high speed, the dialogues and especially the shots and explosions. Also noteworthy is the good work of Donner himself, who leads the scene safely and involves the viewer completely in the narrative with less than ten minutes of projection. The opening sequence also reveals the main feature of the series, mixing action and good humor when Riggs laughs during the chase and tells Roger that he was right, as he ""didn't have room"" for the car to pass. Jeffrey Boam's script also spreads several dialogues about banal things throughout the narrative, such as the method used by the drive-thru to deceive customers, which reinforces the relaxed atmosphere.Donner's competent management is also responsible for conducting the optimal action sequences. In one of the great scenes in the film, the sound of helicopters over water serves as a warning for Riggs and Rika to try to escape before the massacre provided by the villains in their trailer. The action also appears in full force in the third act, first with Riggs' fury, which results in the destruction of Arjen's house (notice how he explodes with satisfaction when the house comes down) and then, with the tense final sequence inside the ship, where as in the first film, Riggs solves his problems in a fight with his rival. Donner still creates a little suspense when Riggs falls shot, but the good humor returns with full force in the last and funny dialogue of the duo, with Riggs lying in the lap of the friend.One of the marks of the series, good humor appears in full force in this second film, for example, when Roger watches together with the whole family Rianne's commercial about condoms (even Roger laughs when the policemen set up a tree in honor of the commercial daughter) or when the sound of the nailing machine causes Riggs and Roger to lie on the floor with guns in hand. Note that not even the villains escape the jokes in the script, as when one of Arjen's henchmen says that ""he was only seeing if he was on top of plastic"", in a funny reference to the death of another partner. In another hilarious moment, Roger is stuck in the toilet due to a bomb and Riggs, despite promising not to cause much fanfare, summons the entire police department and the press. Quickly, the moment of relaxation is replaced by tension before the bomb explodes, which also serves for the pair to once again prove their affinity and friendship through the dialogue that precedes the explosion. Another moment that escapes the light tone of the narrative happens when Trish Murtaugh (Darlene Love) finds a golden pen, which serves as a hook for the script to explain how the death of Riggs' wife Vicki was, and show how this subject is clearly still disturbs you. Finally, Jeffrey Boam subtly criticizes the script, such as the bet paid by a policeman with the South African currency that demonstrates police corruption or political protest against the killing of fish by shouting for Roger not to eat tuna.Keeping one of the characteristics of the first film, the fragility of the villains is evident in several moments of the film. Note, for example, the ease with which Riggs enters the South African consulate building after the riot set up by Roger. Again the villains fail to give the feeling that they pose any threat to the police duo, perhaps due to the light tone of the narrative or simply due to the bandits' only reasonable performances. Not even Donner's attempt, by magnifying Arjen on the screen by filming him from the bottom up or by showing the big boss eliminating one of his cronies after he lost his money in a car escape, cannot turn the villain into someone fearful. It is only in the third act that the bandits finally come to pose a serious threat, when they begin to eliminate all policemen from their path. At this moment, in fact, the plot considerably increases the dramatic load, through the murder of Rika (Patsy Kensit), in an impressive underwater plan, the torture of Leo and the revelation of the murderer of Vicki. Even Gibson's performance improves considerably at this point, expressing the character's anger very well (""I'm not a cop this night. It's personal!"") And going into revenge in a crazy way. ""Don't try to stop me Roger,"" says Riggs, clearly upset and thirsty for revenge.Lethal Weapon 2 a commercial success even greater than its predecessor, even if the script does not stand up to a closer analysis, serving only as an excuse for the construction of action set pieces and for the inclusion of jokes and catch phrases. The theme of racial conflicts in South Africa, which still lived under the Apartheid regime, is treated superficially and the development of the secondary characters is very limited. The beautiful Patsy Kensit has a strong presence on the screen as Riggs' love interest, but little appears, while the great Joss Ackland manages to build a menacing villainous figure, albeit one-dimensional. Fortunately, for the film's audience and producers, Donner's skillful and safe direction, the precise editing work of Stuart Baird, the atmospheric soundtrack of Michael Kamen, David Sanborn and Eric Clapton, and the charisma of Gibson and Glover ensure that the level of quality and entertainment of the first copy is maintained here.",Lethal Weapon 2
82,BroadswordCallinDannyBoy,Good sequel,8,2 March 2004,"As far as follow-ups to blockbuster films go, this is one of the best. The chemistry between Riggs and Martaugh is back, but now Leo Getz is also in the mix. That results in many hilarious moments. Leo: ""How do I know you are the police?"" Riggs: ""When I shoot you through the door you can examine the bullet."" LOL. Also you'll be treated to Martaugh's daughter's first acting job, in a commercial for a product we all love but don't really talk about too much. The action is also top notch and there are some great stunts: falling six stories into a swimming pool and a funny surf board death among others. Plus the story of this film ties itself into the story of the first. Most sequels don't really do that. Die Hard 2, for example, only resembles the first in having the same protagonist. Watch this one. 8/10",Lethal Weapon 2

You could read all the background information and note that this was actually an ending of the franchise. You could argue it might have been a good idea, but the sequels still have this humour added in this film. I tend to rare this film higher than the first, but that's a disservice to the first film. Great actors and action packed sequel that works. Well worth a look if you haven't already. Many attempted clones followed this franchise, with varying degrees of success.",Lethal Weapon 2

Life is the parade of bodies before your eyes, and death is merely the place where all those bodies go. Death is a bank, no withdraws, deposit only. What is the value of the totality of all our struggles? What is the value of our individual struggles? The best of all the Lethal Weapon movies, but all that that means is a formula worked well once and has since then been less and less effective. This movie has action sequences, and comedy! This movie was made in the 1980's, 1989, but still, its an Eighties movie! Nostalgia is poison gas that is gingerbread scented, breathe deep! Yes, Lethal Weapon 2 has nudity, yes the bad guys die at the end.",Lethal Weapon 2
87,DarthVoorhees,An action gem,10,25 September 2015,'Lethal Weapon 2' is the absolute perfect example of why the eighties were the renaissance of the action film. I've seen so many bad action films that it becomes hard to decipher what makes an excellent one but I feel that 'Lethal Weapon 2' should be studied as an example. It has all the ingredients I think are essential to making a good action film. The movie most importantly has incredible loud action sequences that have weight because they aren't mired in computer effects or post production trickery and have stunt performers. It also isn't fearful in indulging in violence without being gratuitous. It isn't realistic and there's theatricality but it's not at the two extremes of cartoony blood or PG-13 action fast cuts when someone gets shot. It has grit and blood but it's also so alive with great characters.Most importantly are the characters and the acting. This film solves the problem of the first film in having memorable villains. The whole South Africa apartheid villainy is played for all the hate you can project on these goofy characters. Joss Ackland is so delightful. His performance masterfully skates at being just campy enough to get all the smiles you can without going into the ridiculous. But of course the bulk of the praise must go to the leads. Glover and Gibson are so charismatic and likable that the scenes where they drive to the shoot outs are still highly entertaining. I had a ball revisiting this one.,Lethal Weapon 2
88,rossrobinson,fantastic,10,22 December 2003,"Leathal Weapon 2 i think is a fantastic movie. There is so far 4 Leathal Weapon movies. I hope there will be more of these in the future.

89,Peach-2,Same old stuff.,7,2 November 1998,"I have to wonder if they made this movie for any other reason other than a nice paycheck. The main reason I wonder this is because it seems like everybody is just runnng thru the paces here. The screenplay by Jeffrey Boam is well done but why the need for so much wasteless comedy. Mel Gibson and Danny Glover are good as best friends with a little banter back and forth. But they decided to bring Joe Pesci in for more comedy relief that isn't even needed. Pesci plays one of the most irritating characters I've ever seen in the movies and this character almost brings the whole movie to the level of slapstick. Richard Donner does a good job keeping the action rolling but ultimately must have had a blast with Gibson, Glover and Pesci. There are a lot of scenes that just didn't need to be here. I was entertained but confused.",Lethal Weapon 2
90,Jithindurden,Weapon is dark and lethal,8,13 December 2017,"As good as the first one, which starts off with a chase and keeps the tight pace throughout. There's more comedy than the first and Gibson and Glover are at the top of their game yet it manages to be much darker. Shane Black's first draft was supposed to be a much darker film which could've been a great film from what I've read about it nevertheless what we got isn't so bad after all.",Lethal Weapon 2
91,departed07,A sequel that is much better than expected!,10,19 March 2008,"Lethal Weapon 2 is a rare sequel in which compared to many movie sequels, this one could be ranked as one of the many great sequels along with being one of the better action movies of 1989.In 1987, movie fans were introduced to partners, the wacky but volatile Martin Riggs (Mel Gibson) and cool but cautious Roger Murtaugh (Danny Glover) to a little known movie called Lethal Weapon. Two years later the cops are back for more ass-kicking and blowing up the bad guys than before where there is more than meets the eye.Riggs and Murtaugh just finish chasing down a couple of bad guys where they noticed that there's a load of stolen money before realizing its from drug traffic. The subplot involves a ruthless villain played by Joss Ackland who's pretending to be a diplomat for South Africa where they could do their crime in Los Angeles; there's also a witness that both Riggs and Murtaugh look after by the name of Leo Getz (Joe Pesci) who can't seem to shut the hell up at any cost. Leo's a witness to bringing down the fake diplomat whereas Riggs discovers that one of the criminals wanting to kill him, Murtaugh and Leo has ties to his wife's death.Lethal Weapon 2 still proves to be a wham, bam, thank you ma'am movie where it feels like between the action, the relationship of the characters and the talking, this sequel proves to outshine most sequels.",Lethal Weapon 2

96,lagudafuad,The best of the four,7,7 March 2013,"Lethal Weapon 1 started the love for the duo, but Lethal Weapon 2 defined it and made it certain that everyone will queue up to see Lethal Weapon 3. The dynamic duo this time is up against South Africans and we get to see the tie in between how Riggs wife died and the films subplot. The score as usual was just efficient, reason why efficient is the word is that it is just perfect, the jazz vibe just adds to the fun and makes the film grand.This action comedy was released two years after the first and the leads Danny Glover and Mel Gibson reprised their roles as Murtaugh and Riggs respectively. The movie's plot is very insightful and the lines were timely. The introduction of Joe Pesci (Academy Award winner for Best Supporting actor in Goodfellas 1990) was all that this movie needed to make it the best out of all the four in the film series, he introduced some laughs and he had a more prominent role in this film than he did in the other two.The movie plot is about this two Roger Murtaugh (Danny Glover) and Martin Riggs (Mel Gibson) against a South African diplomat who was using his immunity to carry out criminal activities. While they were on the case they met Leo Getz (Joe Pesci) who also crossed the South African.The movie is very intense, we get to see both parties in tight corners and this time Riggs was the one that had to experience a personal attack on his home. This flick was the most brutal of the four from my own view and some of the police officers cast in the first film were killed off.The movie was a critical success and it has the highest approval rating of all the four films, and the movie was also a commercial success. Mel Gibson, Danny Glover, and Richard Donner have all stated that this is their favorite film of the Lethal Weapon series and we get to see Riggs dislocate his shoulders twice which later became a regular in the film series.After this film Richard Donner who also directed the first went ahead to do two more and Leo Getz was also a part of the remaining two films.Word is out that a Lethal Weapon 5 will be done soon and two new leads will be employed to come take up the role of Roger and Martin, I just hope they can live up to the standard that this two has set.www.lagsreviews.com",Lethal Weapon 2
97,Cinemaniac1984,The unbeatable chemistry continues on from the original Lethal Weapon. Still just as good as the original.,9,25 August 2015,"Lethal Weapon 2 doesn't recycle ideas and plot points from the first movie, but instead expands on the first movie by developing Martin Riggs and Roger Murtaugh's personal lives, the introduction of new villains, and the addition of a third sidekick which adds plenty of moments of humour. The action is still just as good, and there is still plenty to enjoy about Lethal Weapon 2.Lethal Weapon 2 wastes no time getting started as we see LAPD Detectives Martin Riggs (Mel Gibson) and Roger Murtaugh (Danny Glover) in the middle of a police pursuit through the streets of Los Angeles with an unidentified suspect driving a red BMW which turns out to be transporting a trunk full of gold Krugerrands. There is an illegal smuggling operation which is being spearheaded by South African consul-general Arjen Rudd (Joss Ackland) and his chief enforcer Pieter Vorstedt (Derrick O' Connor) however they are blatantly doing so while hiding behind the fact they have ""Diplomatic Immunity"". Captain Harris (Steve Kahan) assigns Riggs and Murtaugh to babysit the irritating, obnoxious and overeager Leo Getz (Joe Pesci), a federal witness who is going to testify against the South African smuggling operation. Riggs also finds himself a love interest, Rika Van Den Haas (Patsy Kensit) who is also Rudd's secretary at the South African Consulate. Rudd and Vorstedt continue to deceitfully continue their smuggling operation while hiding their diplomatic credentials and Riggs and Murtaugh vow to take them down.Lethal Weapon 2 adds a lighter comedic element with the introduction of Joe Pesci as Leo Getz. It's hard to believe upon seeing Leo Getz that Joe Pesci would later net himself an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor as the volatile Tommy De Vito in Goodfellas (1990). Here in Lethal Weapon 2, Pesci's Leo Getz is nothing more than an irritating annoyance but enhances the comic relief to counterbalance the violent action scenes.It was great to see Mel Gibson and Danny Glover continue their dynamic partnership as Martin Riggs and Roger Murtaugh. Lethal Weapon 2 is a perfect example of a sequel that continues the story and introduces more elements rather than rehashing the story from the first movie. Joss Ackland and Derrick O'Connor were excellent as the chief villains of the movie. Patsy Kensit adds sex appeal as the beautiful Rika Van Den Haas who finds herself caught up in the war between the LAPD and the South African criminals.Keep an eye out for Dean Norris (TV's Breaking Bad), Jeanette Goldstein (Terminator 2: Judgment Day) and Mark Rolston (The Departed) in small roles.Director Richard Donner has continued to weave his magic as a director and has struck box office gold with the success of Lethal Weapon 2 as one of the biggest movies of 1989.What can you say about Lethal Weapon 2?

They seem to have the upper hand in taking down Rudd's gang until they realize one very menacing thing about Rudd and his gang...they have diplomatic immunity and cannot be arrested.Like the first Lethal Weapon, the enemy is an evil gang with its super-evil leader, and its clear cut who the enemy is. What's different is the methods they use and the action/fighting scenes. Also here, there is a new member of the gang, the hunted, klutzy Leo Getz (Joe Pesci).I feel this movie's action scenes were great, but the character development wasn't as good as the first.

103,jcbutthead86,One Of The Best Action Films and Sequels Of All Time. An Absolute Classic.,10,1 June 2013,"Lethal Weapon 2 is one of the best Action films ever made and not only that it is one of the best sequels of all time. Filled with great direction,amazing cast,excellent action and a great score Lethal Weapon 2 is a true classic of the Action genre and is one of my favorite films.Set two years after the events of the first film,Lethal Weapon 2 brings back Riggs(Mel Gibson)and Murtaugh(Danny Glover)who now have to deal with South African diplomats who use their diplomatic immunity to do criminal activities. At the same time Riggs and Murtaugh have to watch and protect fast talking accountant Leo Getz(Joe Pesci) who used to work for the South Africans and is now testifying against them. Now Riggs and Murtaugh have to protect Leo and stop the South African diplomats once and for all.Lethal Weapon 2 a film that I have loved since I first saw it when I was a kid and was the film that introduced me to the Lethal Weapon films. Mel Gibson,Danny Glover and Richard Donner have always said that Lethal Weapon 2 has always been their favorite film of the the franchise and it has been my favorite film of the franchise because Lethal Weapon 2 takes the Action and brilliance of the first film and raises it higher giving viewers an intense,powerful and Action packed experience. One of the reasons I think that Lethal Weapon 2 is one of the best sequels of all time and one of the best Action films of all time is because LW2 while a sequel to the first film is different from the first in terms of story and execution where the Action is bigger and louder and much more violent than in the first film. LW2 is a also a great sequel because it works on it's own where it is not necessary to watch the first film because when you watch LW2 you are pulled in by the main characters and you know them as the film goes along. The screenplay by Jeffrey Boam is well-written and filled with great dialog that matches Shane Black's great script in the first film. The Comedy and Humor in LW2 is funny and gives the film a much lighter tone than the first film because of the situations and dialog between the characters Riggs,Murtaugh and Leo a relationship that would go on in the other films and the Comedy and Humor is a great balance to the serious tone of this film. Most Action films during the 80s were known for having a political and social commentary and LW2 is no different with LW2 commenting on South Africa,Apartheid and racism and while the film isn't overly political there is enough social commentary that gives this film an edge. LW2 moves at a great and relentless pace and moves so fast that you barely have time to catch a breath or take a break because LW2 grabs you by the throat and doesn't let go until the end and that is one of the things I love about the film. Riggs,Murtaugh and Leo Getz are a great trio in this film and the rest of the series because the dialog and situations between the three is hilarious because the personalities are all different. Riggs is crazy and mad,Murtaugh is straight laced and logical while Leo Getz is fast talking and a loud mouth. Leo Getz is a great character because while he talks a lot and annoys Riggs and Murtaugh,Leo is smart and knows how to get things done and sometimes gets things done in a hilarious way. The South African villains in this film are classic villains in the LW series because of their vicious and cold hearted way of doing things and using their diplomatic immunity to do their illegal activities whether it is killing people or smuggling things into the United States. The South Africans are great foes for Riggs and Murtaugh. The Action and fight scenes in the film are brilliant and well-executed and are handled in a much bigger scale than in the first film and every Action scene is suspenseful and exciting and the Action scenes in this film are something you will never forget. The final 20-30 minutes are thrilling and Action packed and is a excellent conclusion that will have your eyes glued to the screen. A great ending to this amazing film.The cast does great jobs in their roles. Mel Gibson and Danny Glover are brilliant once again as Riggs and Murtaugh and once again have great chemistry. Joe Pesci is great and hilarious as Leo Getz,with Pesci having amazing chemistry with Gibson and Glover. Joss Ackland(Arjen Rudd) and Derrick O'Connor(Pieter Vorstedt)are menacing and fantastic as the South African villains. Patsy Kensit is great and beautiful as Rika,Riggs love interest who also works for Arjen. Steve Kahan(Capt. Murphy),Mary Ellen Trainor(Police Psychologist),Darlene Love(Trish Murtaugh),Traci Wolfe(Rianne Murtaugh),Damon Hines(Nick Murtaugh)and Ebonie Smith(Carrie Murtaugh)give good performances as well.The direction by Richard Donner is excellent,with Donner always moving the camera and giving the film a great energy and pace while also doing well with the Action scenes. Wonderful direction by Donner.The score by Eric Clapton and Michael Kamen is excellent and intense and fits the tone of this film. A great score by Clapton and Kamen. There is also a great song from George Harrison(Cheer Down)and a memorable use of the Bob Dylan classic Knockin' On Heaven's Door(covered by Eric Clapton,Randy Crawford and David Sandborn).In final word,if you love Action films or the Lethal Weapon series,I highly suggest you see Lethal Weapon 2,a classic Action film and sequel that you can watch again and again. Highly Recommended. 10/10.",Lethal Weapon 2
104,x_manicure_x,Best in the series,7,14 August 2021,"""Lethal Weapon 2"" drops the half-assed dramatic pretentiousness of the first installment and goes for a more lighthearted tone and tighter pacing. I feel bad for Shane Black's scrapped script, but the leads have better chemistry, the humor stinks 80's but delivers, and the action sequences improved significantly. Joe Pesci's character is annoying as hell but triggers a lot of memorable moments. We are talking about pure entertainment, but I could feel the magic and the heart being in the right place. By far my favorite ""Lethal Weapon"", and probably the only more-than-decent entry in the franchise.",Lethal Weapon 2
105,troyputland,The characters make up for the lack of action.,8,11 November 2015,"Lethal Weapon was just the beginning. It sets up the relationship between Riggs (Mel Gibson) and Murtaugh (Danny Well) well, with a strong story to boot. The second has the cops in a tight knit, their banter brushing off each other with satisfying effects. Murtaugh is still angry, and Riggs is still crazy, just less suicidal. They're the cop duo others try to replicate. LW2 carries over LW's best bits, while adding extra bonuses for all to revel in. Newcomer Joe Pesci ('I'm Leo Getz, and whatever you want, Leo gets.') is great but does grate, repeating 'ok' so many times I didn't know whether to laugh or cry. The only drawback to LW2 is too much time and effort's spent on character development, as the South African criminals they face have no personalities. This is made up for by a shocking twist involving a key character's past.",Lethal Weapon 2
106,Pookyiscute,Excellent! My favorite of the four installments...,10,9 May 2006,"This is without a doubt, my favorite Lethal Weapon film. It has all the things I love in an action movie, and I don't even like action.Mel Gibson and Danny Glover, take the lead again in this almost seemingly never ending story of two police sgts. sent out to do the dirty work, by cleaning up the town of bad guys. The opening scene gives us no breather, by any means. It's already a chase scene with our future enemies throughout the entire film.There's a great deal of comedy in this one too. Joe Pecsi joins the cast, and is in several scenes of the film, always leaving us laughing waiting to see what he will have the two cops saying next.Patsy Kinst is also a favorite in the film. She's the naive yet sexy love interest of Riggs (Gibson), and plays her part very well.There's every single element in this movie which makes up great action, and film. Sex, fighting, guns, comedy, explosions, beautiful women and rough and tough all-American policemen.I love the film, and can't wait to see it again. An A+ in my estimation.",Lethal Weapon 2
107,SMLA11,Great sequel,10,2 June 2002,"This movie is an excellent sequel to an amazing movie.  This movie has the great duo of Mel Gibson and Danny Glover are back this time, thwarting South African diplomats.  they are joined by Joe Pesci, who might I add is very good.  The plot is simple, as I told the plot before.  The direction is very good, as was the last one.  Sadly, I have to say, this one set off the not so great part 3.Overall the movie is good on many angles and very enjoyable to watch. Rating 10 out of 10.",Lethal Weapon 2
108,stills-6,A great follow-up to a great action movie,8,13 September 1999,"This one has more production values - better sets, bigger stunts - but what makes it all work is the chemistry between Glover and Gibson. I have to admit, Gibson could have chemistry with a can of Spam, but Glover stays right with him.There is more of a focus on the plot in this one and Gibson's acting is less intense because of it. David Warner was a nice surprise as one of the bad guys, and he has one of the best lines in the movie. But there is still one of those silly kickboxing sequences.",Lethal Weapon 2
109,Indy-52,the best LW film!,8,4 March 2000,"i am not such a big fan of this series, Lethal Weapon was a bore, LW 3 sucks majorly, and LW 4 was even worse. I didn't have such high hopes for this one when i saw it on tv, but finally i liked it very much! This film is definitely the best in the LW series: it has the best story and best action and best villains and best humor. I just loved Joe Pesci, he's got a tendency to whine, but he's very funny (anything you need, Leo Getz, get it? It's very good, i use it to break the ice with my clients). The scene with the bomb in the toilet was great, very funny, although i think Roger's character was a bit wasted throughout the film. Anyway, the chemistry between Riggs and Murtaugh is better than ever and the scenes with Riggs and the nazi's or whatever they were, were very funny. I recommend this film to action and comedy fans.",Lethal Weapon 2
110,monkeysgalore,Diplomatic Immunity,10,15 November 2018,"This is a truly awesome movie, let alone a sequel. I loved this film as much, if not more, than the spectacular first installment, and whatever the first film was lacking, this film more than made up for. Sequels aren't usually this good, which makes this movie even better. This film delivered, and it is arguably better than the first one, though I haven't yet decided that for myself.Riggs and Murtaugh are back, and this time they're on the trail of a group of British-Columbian diplomats who double as drug traffickers and cop killers. After they threaten Murtaugh's family and murder several fellow cops, Riggs and Murtaugh leap into action, dishing out brutal vengeance. This time, they're joined by Leo Getz, a weaselly mob accountant trying to go straight.""Lethal Weapon 2"" essentially takes everything you loved about the first film; the action, the friendship, the interesting story, the breakneck pacing, the character development, the humor, and it pretty much just builds on these qualities. The story is new, and it's as good as the first one in my opinion, just with a less menacing villain, but that's a small price to pay. It's pretty much the first one, but with some more comedy, and if you saw the first one, than I think you will enjoy this one. It continues to develop the characters of Riggs and Murtaugh, as well as their friendship, to the point where they're now best friends and would take a bullet for each other, and the relationship that the two have is really fun to see, as they're pretty much all but brothers (no homo though).As is expected, ""Lethal Weapon 2"" fully delivers with its action. Brutal, hard-hitting, and wildly entertaining, the action sequences just explode on screen, and are so much fun to watch. The film opens with an intense car chase, which is, in my opinion, one of the best car chase scenes in movie history, and doesn't let up from there. There's a truck chase, a standoff inside of the British Columbian embassy, the house fight, and a final, sensational, explosive, brutal final fight/shootout. This film packs all the action from the first one into the sequel here, and turns it up a little.As I said, there's definitely more comedy, as Riggs is now a class clown as well as a killing machine, which adds an extra, really likable element to his character, further adding to the already complex personality that Shane Black has presented us with. Murtaugh is still there as well, with his family, and the scenes with Riggs and the family are really great, I can't describe it.Everyone's performances were good and memorable, as Mel Gibson and Danny Glover once again command the screen, drawing us in arguably more than the last film. I don't care what anyone says, I liked the addition of Joe Pesci, and he was really entertaining. Joss Ackland was a great villain, and he had the honor of uttering what is probably the most famous line from the movie: ""DIPLOMATIC IMMUNITY!""All in all, I can't recommend this and the first film enough. There's no reason not to watch this, so go do it. 10/10, wish I could give it more.",Lethal Weapon 2
111,blacklist-1,The best of the four!,10,30 July 2010,"I don't know what it is about Lethal Weapon 2 but I have always found it the best out of the four. Gibson and Glover return as cop-comedy duo Riggs and Murtagh on the tail of a South African syndicate that deal in money and drugs that all have diplomatic immunity from the law. But that dosen't stop Riggs. There is plenty of terrific laughs between Gibson and Glover with Joe Pesci joining them as Leo Getz. The comic chemistry is fantastic as ever (thanks to a great script) mixing with the action. The action sequences, which are very entertaining are choreographed excellently with great acting from all involved including Patsy Kensit who plays Rigg's love interest and makes a lasting impression.The story itself has a surprising twist that connects to Rigg's deceased wife that makes him lose it. He certainly gets lethal in this one. This is a roller-coaster ride of action and laughs from start to finish. A fantastic and very enjoyable sequel. Great fun!",Lethal Weapon 2
112,claudonio,"The Best ""Lethal Weapon""",8,22 March 2000,"""Lethal Weapon 2"" is the best film out of the 4 ""Lethal Weapon"" films. The main reason that this is the best one is because it has more comedy than the other films in the trilogy and the reason this film is so funny is because Joe Pecsi who plays Leo Getz. There is more action in this film also, I highly reccomend this film.",Lethal Weapon 2
113,smooth_op_85,Wonderful action packed film with a message,10,8 December 2009,"Riggs and Murtaugh are back and better than ever in this sequel that stacks up as worthy to the original! Mel Gibson and Danny Glover along with a squad are in pursuit of diplomats that are using their ties to engage in illegal activity through the streets of LA with shots being fired and explosions happening with the squad members in pursuit. First, they chase a red BMW that contains Kugerands (the criminal escapes via helicopter) and then Murtaugh receives a warning to lay off the lead he discovered. After the warning to lay off they must protect Leo Getz (played wonderfully by Joe Pesci) and it is now revealed that he was in league with the same South Africans they were chasing--money laundering was the name of the game. When one of the South Africans disguised as a waiter attempts to kill Leo, they are once again in pursuit and find a stilt house. A car chase ensues and the squad shows up to the house of Arjen Rudd, who hides behind his diplomatic status to evade capture. Riggs and Murtaugh are now in hot water as the State Department is breathing down the captain's neck and they have to issue a formal apology. After Arjen sees Riggs just about everywhere and Murtaugh raises a ruckus stating: Free South Africa; Riggs comes in, beats up some of the thugs but not before grabbing a vital clue: Alba Varden Thursday. The diplomats turn the heat up when they start killing cops on the case and even Murtaugh is targeted again with a bomb on the toilet. Riggs after all the commotion is gradually taken up with a young lady named Rika Van Den Haas (all the murders happen on the same day) and they have a night together--only to end with Riggs' trailer shot up and Riggs being the gentleman and taking her home--only to be killed by her colleagues and Boss and Riggs being kidnapped and thrown in a river with a straight jacket on. After dislocating his shoulder, he gets up and kills the two South Africans that dumped him in the river. However, before he was thrown in the river, he was told by Pieter, the muscle of the operation that he was the one that killed Riggs' wife Victoria. Now, it's personal and they take out all the South Africans one by one--until only Rudd is standing who shoots Riggs up and shouts: Diplomatic Immunity. Murtaugh does his trademark neck crack and shoots Rudd dead after stating: Just been revoked ================ I am not sure how accurate the accents are, or how apartheid was and neither am interested in ""understanding"" apartheid. It was a racist system that made the majority subject to a minority race. As a work of fiction, I am soo glad that this was written to show the ugliness of apartheid as well as balancing humor in its action. Top notch film!",Lethal Weapon 2

The teamwork of Riggs and Murtaugh really starts to stride in this movie, in the first there was that tension that really made their relationship interesting, but in this sequel, you see their relationship really start to mold and take shape.The toilet scene is CLASSIC and who could ever forget ""Diplomatic Immunity!""?

116,CherryBlossomBoy,Sequels are the places where the originals come to die,5,21 July 2017,"If ""Lethal Weapon"" was a farewell to the action film era before the advent of ""Die Hard"" type techno-thrillers, the best and the most polished laid-back buddy-buddy flick done in the style of 70s and 80s, ""Lethal Weapon 2"" is its zombie reincarnation, a deconstruction of everything that was good about the first film.One could probably look at this film in its own right, and as such its a decent late 80s flick, more suited to the TV than to the big screen. But since it owes everything to the iconic predecessor, and it is a direct sequel, it has to be viewed as a cynical cash-in. As cynical as they come.Just like the ""2"" in the uninspired title suggests: everything is just being rehashed. Everything, minus the grit and the poignancy of the ""1"". All the known tropes are there and not a single catchphrase from the first film is dropped and some new have been added. Jeffrey Boam, who was hired in ""Lethal Weapon"" to sprinkle Shane Black's script with a bit of welcome humor is called in here to fully take the reins and write the whole thing himself without the wit and insight of Black.To maintain the merry character dynamics, the character of Riggs is still crazy, the character of Murtaugh is still fed up with everything, even though their plight was resolved in the previous film. They have also developed an uncomfortable comedic self-awareness about it (""We're bad! You're black, I'm mad""). The character of police psychologist has been reduced to a one-note joke. The villains are yet another para-militaristic bunch, this time so unconvincing in their manner of operating and existence one wonders how are they not taken down already before this film takes place. Also a lot of jokes stem from the fact that their origin is placed in the South African Republic. Apartheid and Hitler jokes, you know. Har. Har. The whole ""police under siege"" climax is unbelievable. No police force would just sit there like stool pigeons, waiting for the bad guys to off them one by one. Riggs and Murtaugh take the gang on by themselves just because they've done so in the first film. Hardly as exciting as it wanted to be.The worst and the most notable thing, of course, is the inclusion of the psycho midget Joe Pesci in the cast. His insufferable turn as Leo Getz is probably the producers' idea of how to make the film more accessible to a broader audience. It's a mystery to me, though. Watching it now, I cannot believe how anybody ever found Pesci funny. He's effective in the roles of psychopaths because that's what he is in real life, but comedy? ""Home Alone""? Really?The rest of the cast is not much better either. Gibson is having too much fun with his character and Glover just acts like he has stomach problems. Joss Ackland and Derrick O'Connor are hamming it up to the max as the main villains, but one can hardly blame them. They know what they've got themselves into. Patsy Kensit has nailed the blonde bimbo stereotype even though that may not have been her intention. Richard Donner, the director, looks pretty out of shape even though you can't see him in any shots. His direction is pretty loose, concentrated more on the action set pieces than on the overall pace. The action scenes, as well as the toilet scene, are still good to watch but they cannot compensate for all the mistakes, including some amateur ones. There are some really awkward reaction shots of Gibson and there is a cringe-worthy on-the-nose revenge scene where Gibson shoots one of the henchmen accompanied by off-narration of the names of all the cops killed during the film.""Loaded Weapon"" came out four years later, and even though it's an excellent send up to this franchise, they need not have bothered. Much like ""Die Hard 2"" to ""Die Hard"", ""Lethal Weapon 2"" is a perfect parody of itself.",Lethal Weapon 2
117,writenamehere,Deliberately provoking racial tension.,2,30 October 2019,"After the reasonable level of content in the first Lethal Weapon, this one fails on all points. The violence ramps up to Macho Hero Level Nine, the dialogue descends to Mumble-bumpf Level Two, and the worst accents known to man come out to play. It's adolescent, chauvinist, nasty, impossible, and the characters actually get dumber as events progress. Riggs puts on a cap to show he's angry. Murtaugh leaves his badge at the office so he can get away with murder. Also included is the sex scene you least ever wanted to see, but didn't know until you saw it. Some stuff is unintentionally funny, but will later hurt your brain. Only watch if you want to complete the series.",Lethal Weapon 2
118,Snake-666,Worthy and exciting sequel!,7,20 August 2003,"Riggs and Murtaugh are back in the first sequel to the classic Lethal Weapon'! The duo are hot on the trail of a South African drugs cartel but efforts to arrest them prove fruitless as the criminals have diplomatic immunity from arrest in the US.Lethal Weapon 2' is in my opinion a worthy sequel to its predecessor and in some ways better. Enhancing the story from the original rather than trying to change it we are now confronted with a `lighter' Martin Riggs (Mel Gibson). The strong friendship that has grown between the two is beautifully portrayed in a scene where Riggs puts his life on the line to save his buddy's Roger Murtaugh (Danny Glover). Although the scene in question is in some ways amusing the well constructed dialogue and the acting abilities of Glover and Gibson make it easily one of the most touching and suspenseful scenes in recent film history. Murtaugh's character remains the same as he tries to cope with the madness that Riggs always brings but you can tell that he is rapidly becoming accustomed to it and, to some extent, has even started to enjoy it. Lethal Weapon 2' succeeds primarily in the touching and emotional portrayal of the friendship of Riggs and Murtaugh so much so that the heart-wrenching final moments and final shot from Murtaugh's gun have so much more impact than one would expect.Lethal Weapon 2' also brings in a comedy element that the original did not have (and understandably so) in the form of Joe Pesci as Leo Getz, a witness for the state who laundered drug money that Murtaugh and Riggs were forced to protect. From the first moment these three people meet each other there are constant giggles but thankfully the jokes are a lot more restricted than they became later in the series. By Lethal Weapon 4' there were far too many jokes which distracted attention away from the action and storyline. Luckily, in Lethal Weapon 2'  the jokes were used to enhance the film and the main storyline as well as some explosive and thrilling action sequences were still the central focal point of the movie.From the exhilarating car chase that opens Lethal Weapon 2' to the battle that ends it there are plenty of well choreographed, directed and entertaining action sequences. The script for Lethal Weapon 2' is very strong, as it was for the original, which makes the whole movie have a feeling of leading up to something which is an excellent quality for a movie to have. I have already commented on the acting abilities of Gibson and Glover who were on top form for this picture but I feel I must also compliment Patsy Kensit for her somewhat short role as Rigg's love interest Rika and also Joss Ackland and Derrick O' Connor for their excellent performance as the leaders of the criminal gang.I certainly recommend this movie to action fans and any fans of the original. Lethal Weapon 2' delivers exhilarating action and adept performances complimented marvellously by great direction and a tight script. My rating for Lethal Weapon 2'  7.5/10",Lethal Weapon 2
119,tmpj,Somewhat better than the first time around....,6,6 May 2010,"Lethat Weapon 2 is, surprisingly, a bit better than the first time around. The script is better, and the action is a bit more focused, though the plot is incredulous. This time the knuckleheads stumble across bad guys who, in this opus just prior to the ""fall"" of Apartheid in South Africa, are moving tons of Krugerrands out of the country (U.S.) under cover of diplomatic immunity. What does not square is the ending, and it is left up to the viewer to draw his/her conclusions. Lots of blood, guts, and killing going on for you viewers thirsty for action. At one point during the film, the bad guys appear to have declared war on the police department. The diplomatic aspect of the film is quite interesting, though it is never played up to full effect. The racial aspect has an edge on it as well...in those days there were dis-investments in S Africa by businesses and institutions of conscience, and the racists in S Africa were definitely feeling the heat, which led to its eventual downfall. Not all whites in S Africa are of a racist bent, nor do they fit the profile...but government policies had the same effect as rain...rain falls on everyone there, the fair-minded S Africans a well as the racists. But the movie itself is not a political statement. It is just action packed entertainment. I do not recommend it highly, but I found it to be something of an interesting watch....much to my amazement.",Lethal Weapon 2

I was expecting a sequel that would've been on the same level as its predecessor and it did... for others. While the sequel did get more attention over its original part, I myself was dissatisfied.While the sequel went towards a more comedic approach, it just didn't work for me and found it missed opporturnity. It nearly didn't felt as fun as the first film nor actiony. The new characters just sucked (expect Leo) and they would've gotten more development into their characters, but no. However, I did like that atleast tries to be a true successor by having Joe Pesci, more chaos and more characters.Incase, you like sequels that try to improve over original by more comedic, check this out. But for me, It's a film that just doesn't work for me. Also, I did watch these about 3 years ago. If I do a rerun on 'em again, my opinion might change.",Lethal Weapon 2
122,MadBadMovieman,A good Action drama but too heavy on the politics.,6,4 January 2000,"This was almost a great movie but they went too deep in the politics of Apartheid and a lot of dialogue about race.  It didn't help us enjoy the movie more.  Once again great Chemistry with Gibson & Glover.  Overall great plot, intense, more background and a lot of emotion for how much these 2 cops enjoy, respect and care for each other as partners and friends.  More gags and jokes which helped.  Pesci was also great too.Worth seeing but not quite the edge of the first one.",Lethal Weapon 2
123,charlessmith702210,This sequel is even better than the original Lethal Weapon,9,16 October 2006,"The good news is that the movie avoids the opening credit sequence found on most movies---you go right immediately into the exciting action where Murtaugh and Riggs, along with several other officers, try to chase down a few members of a narcotraffic gang. At the end of the chase, they kick one of the suspect's cars and out comes South African money called the Kreugerrand. After I saw those foreign coins, this was the part that was going to make Lethal Weapon 2 much different than the original.Later, I realized that this drug gang, masked really as members of the Consulate of South Africa, are using their immunity from prosecution and arrest (since they are actually diplomatic agents) to commit drug-trafficking and its related crimes. I also saw some new details on Riggs' characterization. Realizing that he was involved with counterinsurgency tactics and martial arts in the original ""Lethal Weapon"", I realize that he is also a die-hard Houdini fan, during a scene at the police headquarters where Riggs, already bound with a straitjacket, tries to free himself. He does free himself but he slams his shoulder right into the hard wall, on purpose!...With this absurd act, I realized something new in Riggs... in some cases, he loves being hurt (that is, he loves pain) in situations where other people don't want to be involved with being hurt.One of the most serious parts of the movie almost put an end to Murtaugh's life. The movie doesn't reveal it verbally, but the reason why Murtaugh was on a toilet rigged with a C4 explosive bobby-trap behind the toilet (which was ready to blow up if he got up) was that the drug dealers ignored his warning earlier in the movie to stay away from them because they are from the consulate. After bobby-trapping Murtaugh, the gang locked up the house so that Riggs could not get in. (This almost directly shows the type of sectarian violence under apartheid in South Africa around the 1980s.) But Riggs did get in by kicking down the front door. Riggs was the first one to find out that Martaugh was bobby-trapped, especially when he saw the phrase on the bathroom tissue, ""Boom! You're Dead!"" When Riggs called the bomb squad, I knew the Riggs and Murtaugh had their friendship on the line--big time! Their only saving grace, says the bomb squad, was to put LN2 (liquid nitrogen) on the device and for Riggs to pull Murtaugh into the tub since the tub would absorb most of the explosive impact.The narcotraffic gang's last straw was when Riggs' strongly befriended Rika Van Den Haas (played by Patsy Kensit)....and Arjen Rudd (the main bad guy in the movie) orders the gang on a bombing and assassination wave against all of the L.A. officers involved (for example, officer Collins blown away by a booby-trap explosive as she was going to dive into her swimming pool, or officer Wyler being shot in the head by a 9mm) in taking the drug dealers down. Murtaugh came close to his death himself against two of the gang members before he both knocked them out with a nail gun, but not until other assassins kidnap Leo Getz (played by Joe Pesci) and take away Murtaugh's car. At the same time, Riggs and Van den Haas both came close to their deaths by assassins using automatic weapons fire on the house trailer Riggs lived in the first Lethal Weapon movie. Fortunately, there is the same characterization in the previous Lethal Weapon movie--his strong black-bag skills in Vietnam stopped the police-killing assassins in their tracks...saving both him and Van den Haas. This part almost screams ""James Bond"" for Riggs but not exactly. This also reminds me of ""True Lies"", where the protagonist and his love interest (of course, I am talking about Jamie Lee Curtis and Arnold Schwarzenegger) are involved in shootouts with renegade terrorists also with automatic weapons.Patsy Kensit's acting role as Rika is almost like a Dutch version of Madonna....moreover, her character is considered very gentle, especially in her voice. She sounds like as if she should be a presidential candidate to appease the violence in South Africa. The only problem with her that she sometimes speaks too fast.",Lethal Weapon 2

126,mrspasm,We Don't Need A Nuther Hero!,10,25 May 2010,"Burtdog and Hicks return with some guns blazing in this film called Lethal Weapon 2. Buddy movies and sequels were all the rage in the 80s, and this is amongst the best or the worst depending on which way your wind blows. Crazy Gary Busey and Patsy Klinesit also co-star with Crazy Joe Pesci in this crazy romp. Crazy cop Melanie Gibson goes off the rails when his wife is killed by drowning. He teams up once again with Danny Glove to get into action and kill all the water in the world. The problem is, Fanny Lover is also scared of water and keeps getting stuck on toilets so isn't much help. It turns out that Tyrannical (Saurus Rex!)Busey is a surfer who can send tidal waves at sunbathers. He has been steadily growing this power so that he can unleash a huge wave at San Fransico and kill everyone (when he was younger he was rejected by the flighty San Fran crowd for not being flamboyant enough). Rather than going for the logical solution and calling the coast guard or Superman's cousin Water (man) Mel Griffith and Danny Glick decide to take on the wet Bush meister themselves.This film ups you auntie from the first film, and is bigger, better, and not as good. There are plenty of quips and spark between all the cast members (in actual life they are all related to each other and grew up in the same house), and we have car chases, boat chases, surfy chasings, and lots of guns and bombs. This should all add up and equal a good film, but for some reason it doesn't. Maybe they forgot to carry the one. They seem to have done something like 3 + 5 + 5 + 4 = 10. Don't not do not get me wrong, right? Because it is still good, just not as good as it should have been. They would reach new highs with the third film, which is easily the worst of the Octology.Best Scene: When Riggs and Barry are chasing Bushell in the water and he suddenly leaps out at them, yelling paranoid conspiracy theory rhetoric at them before sinking back into the gloomy depths. Gibson turns to his lover and delivers one of the great movie one-liners: 'We might need a bigger boat!'",Lethal Weapon 2
127,nathanjamesemerson,The perfect action duo return,9,28 September 2018,"Mel Gibson and Danny Glover return in the sequel to one of the greatest action movies ever made.Some people say this is the weakest in the series, but I rate it over Lethal Weapon 3.
 
The action scenes are spectacular and when Mel Gibson goes out for revenge against the bad guys at the end, it's full of tension and you root for him and Danny Glover to take them all down. And the chemistry between both actors is still great as well as the supporting characters who return from the previous filmThe movie has several memorable scenes, most famously the toilet bomb scene.And Joe Pesci enters the series as the annoying but likeable Leo Getz. But anything Joe Pesci does is always fantastic. So if you are a fan of the first movie then you owe it to yourself to watch this film and the following sequels",Lethal Weapon 2
128,LeThAlWeApOn389,Not as good as the first but still fantastic (Possible Spoiler),10,11 July 2003,"This was a great movie. It was so funny. And to top it all off, they put Joe Pesci in the middle of the movie which makes it 10x better in comedy wise. I thought the acting was great by Mel Gibson, Danny Glover and Joe Pesci. I thought this was an important movie to make because in this movie, they told what happened to Martin Riggs' wife. It was powerful to see the emotion Martin Riggs had in this movie about his wife because it showed how important she was to him and it showed how much he missed her. The most dangerous thing to do is getting under Martin Riggs' skin but never talk about his wife in a bad way because if you do, there is no doubt that you will be badly injured. I think that's the message being brought into this film and that is very important. This movie was a great movie because it did have a lot of action, comedy and suspense and I recommend this movie to all viewers who like the Lethal Weapon film and who are Mel Gibson fans. I give it ***!!!!!",Lethal Weapon 2

I like all of the Lethal Weapon movies, and this one is after part 2 the best one. I usually like action movies, so I was almost supposed to like this one, too. And I did.The story : Two policemen ( Martin Riggs ( played by Mel Gibson ) and Roger Murtaugh ( played by Danny Glover )) ought to protect a principal witness ( Leo Getz played by Joe Pesci ) get in contact with drugs smullers from South Africa. The film has good action sequences and is funny, too. ( my favorite part has to be when Mel Gibson calls the guy from Austria just Adolf"", because he cannot spell his actual name ). That is very funny. I think part 2 is better than part 1 and 4 and worse than part 2. I think they are all between 8/10 and 9/10, and this one I rate 8.6/10. I recommend it to fans of action films, especially of the Lethal Weapon films, of course.CU; Rinho",Lethal Weapon 2
130,TERMINATOR180,Worthy Sequel,10,16 February 2002,"What can you say about this movie, other than it's the same two guys (Gibson and Glover), new wisecracks, new story, and a new character (Joe Pesci). The addition of Joe Pesci at first had me worried, but it really worked out. The three embark on an adventure filled with action and humor.****/***** Stars",Lethal Weapon 2
131,MinorityReporter,"God, I love this job!",8,29 May 2005,"First of all this movie is almost as good as the original. It retains all of the elements that made the first film so darn entertaining and adds some new elements.As all actors from the first movie appear in the second one as well its pretty clear what you can expect acting wise and surprise, surprise: The acting is still stellar, close to perfection. Mel Gibson is always good and in the second installment of the series he gets to be a little more wild and add even more nuances to the character. For example we get to see Riggs hit on women which adds an entire new side to him as the side we saw in the first film was of him mourning. Also we find out how his wife dies in a beautifully underacted scene (if you want to know how she dies you'll have to see the movie). Danny Glover returns as well and he plays the character pretty much as he did in the first film which is good because the character he plays is the one who is not supposed to change. He is meant to be square and combined with the character of Riggs this becomes highly entertaining. However, a new element is put into the mix to make it even more entertaining, Leo Getz, played beautifully by Joe Pesci and is to this day still one of his most memorable characters. He is funny and fast talking but most importantly: he is a crook and when you put him together with Riggs and Murtaugh the mix becomes explosive. The main villains are played by Joss Ackland and Derrick O'Connor and they are also good and a bit more developed than the villains of the first movie obviously because they had to focus more on the relationship between Riggs and Murtaugh in the first movie. Riggs' love interest is played Patsy Kensit and she is good if a bit underdeveloped. The story is excellent and is almost better than the story in the first one. It is entertaining and funny and best of all the incredible chemistry between Mel Gibson and Danny Glover is maintained and is almost as good as it was in the first movie. Furthermore the addition of Joe Pesci was a very nice touch because he immediately makes the scenes with him, Gibson and Glover even more interesting and entertaining. The plot with the villains is kept relatively simple like in the first film, which is good because the goal for the film is entertainment not to be thought provoking.The action of the film is kept in the same style as in the first movie and it is still both exhilarating and entertaining. The effects are still relatively realistic and this of course gives the movie a level of credibility that is sorely needed in many modern action movies.All in all a worthy sequel and an excellent film on its own. 8/10",Lethal Weapon 2
132,badfeelinganger,"Riggs was originally to die on the boat, but the producer decided to make more movies, hence his survival, after being shot three times.",9,29 September 2014,"Richard Donner directs again, and Mel Gibson and Danny Glover return as LAPD partners, their relationship smoother now that Gibson's character has recovered from his maddening grief over his wife's death. But the reckless Mel and cautious Danny equation, good for a million laughs, settles into place in this story involving a South African smuggler and a new girlfriend (Patsy Kensit) for Gibson. The movie is hardly comfy, though. The last act gets nasty, and a climactic fight between Gibson (who gets the worst of it) and some high-kicking villain is ugly. The chemistry between its leads, make this a playful, entertaining sequel.Sequel Includes a smashed car full of Krugerrands, a hillside house blown off its stilts and a bomb set under a toilet, the point of Lethal Weapon 2 is that Mel Gibson and Danny Glover get to race around in all that chaos, acting crazy.If you liked Lethal Weapon, you'll like Lethal Weapon 2; it's almost as simple as that.""Worse than the first, but better than the rest. it's nice to have a big-audience action movie attacking apartheid and the slaughter of sea mammals, instead of acting as an enlistment poster for the Army Air Corps, local vigilante groups or the reopening of the Vietnam War, the sentiments don't really transcend the car crashes.Pesci's terrific comic performance really gooses the proceedings, but the film also works because of its exciting action content, the presence of Patsy Kensit as Riggs' love interest, and the series-best interplay between the two lead characters. Despite the film's anti-South African stance, it was passed uncut by the South African censors and became a major financial success in that country. .The films' writer, Shane Black, walked away from this sequel after he decided to kill off the character of Martin Riggs. Warner Brothers disagreed with that decision, and he left the project.The body count is 33, the highest of the 'Lethal Weapon' series. During production, Richard Donner was shocked when Mel Gibson confided that he was drinking five pints of beer for breakfast. Despite his alcohol problems, Gibson was known for his professionalism and punctuality. In the original script, the South Africans were even more vicious. At one point, they even torture Riggs in much the same manner as Mr. Joshua in the original. Its a Strong and funny sequel but if went with original ending would be even more classic.Still its one of the finest examples of the genre its a Kick ass sequel by concentrating on the often frustrating, funny relationship between the three men, the film gains in humour but loses some of the momentum and panache which distinguished the original.Mel Gibson, Danny Glover, and Richard Donner have all stated that this is their favourite film of the Lethal Weapon series.",Lethal Weapon 2
133,Falcon-51,Lethally Funny,7,25 December 1999,"Gibson and Glover are back at it again. This time with the comic relief of Joe Pesci this film may rival the 1st in popularity. It has action, adventure, thrills and spills and it's down right silly. Watch for one of the funniest moments in film history when Pesci and Glover go to the South African embassy. Maybe the film is not intended to be a comedy but it sure makes it a watchable feature. The film is just great so go and see it ok, ok, ok.",Lethal Weapon 2

135,ga-bsi,What a thin plot,3,24 May 2009,"Riggs and Murtough are back but the magic of the first film has disintegrated. The story line is just awful! I mean really, South African diplomats smuggling the mythical Krugerrands into the U.S. It's just painful! And the accents are absolutely abysmal! Can no one get an Afrikaans South African accent right? Or will we forever hear the British or Americans making them sound like drunken Hollanders? The only guy who got the Afrikaans accent right was Tim Robbins in Catch A Fire. Another thing about this movie that i disliked was when Danny Glover so artlessly describes an Afrikaans accent as being shitty! I mean what a slap in the face to the Afrikaans. There's also enough hypocrisy in this film to make me vomit. I mean Mel Gibson's character is like so against the diplomats but then sleeps with their P.A. type! Don't waste your time watching this rubbish non-researched film. If you want to see a film that doesn't completely insult a cultural group then rent Die Hard 2.",Lethal Weapon 2

137,mark-whait,Return of Gibson and Glover bogged down in the Afrikaans,7,24 December 2010,"Even though Lethal Weapon 2 is a must see film, it doesn't come close to the breathtaking originality and raw entertainment of the original. This is almost certainly because Mel Gibson and Danny Glover nailed their roles so well in the first movie, that the impact during another outing is diluted somewhat. We now know that Glover is the warm, respected family man whilst Gibson is the loose cannon who will shoot first and ask questions later. It is perhaps a mark of the success of the original that the sequel doesn't quite paper over the cracks of the set pieces that stretch credibility - we've seen it all before, basically. That said, this is still an entertaining movie. Patsy Kensit is a puzzling piece of casting that plays our Mel's love interest, whilst the choice of villain this time, equally strangely, are the South Africans. Given the imminent demise of the Cold War at the time, it was a strange choice, but this in turn gives the movie an easy target of apartheid - especially with the scenes when Glover's character is abused. This sequel also went much more for comedy - and again strangely Joe Pesci is bought in to ramp up the comedic value. Not an automatic first choice for a comedy part, but Pesci does deliver admirably well, even though his character becomes more than a little irritating by the end. Good movie, well worth watching, but not a patch on the original of course.",Lethal Weapon 2
138,Habibi-Universe,A Worthy Sequel,6,24 September 2020,"Richard Donner's 'Lethal Weapon 2' (1989) is the sequel to 'Lethal Weapon' (1986) and it is about Riggs (Mel Gibson) and Murtaugh (Danny Glover) on the trail of South African diplomats who are using their immunity to engage in criminal activities.This film is awesome! The chemistry between Glover and Gibson is incredible and it genuinely feels like they did so many movies together leading up to this franchise even though that is not the case. It is absolutely extraordinary to see these two go back and forth with each other effortlessly (by the looks of it)!
As if that wasn't enough already, they brought in Joe Pesci (who I completely adore as well as his entire body of work)!
This film has some of the most hilarious scenes I have ever seen. The dialogue in the movie is even better than in the first one and thankfully it is not a bland rehash of the first film!As this is still just a buddy cop action comedy, there are reoccuring plot points that everybody is familiar with when it comes to this genre. In other words, at times there was a lack of innovation in the story department. I also recognized a few similarities to the film's predecessor.
Unfortunately the film does share quite a few of the same (or at least similar) story beats with the first film! In all fairness though, it was still handled very well and I am definitely aware that sequels do have the tough task of creating something new while still fitting into the same universe. The film mainly took the dramatic elements of the first film and implemented them into this sequel!I am still amazed that Joe Pesci is in this film and in classic Pesci style, he is awesome, as always!I thought the film was a bit better paced than the first film.
Generally speaking, it is extremely difficult to compare 'Lethal Weapon 2' with 'Lethal Weapon' since both films have their undeniable strengths and admittedly some of the same weaknesses too! I think 'Lethal Weapon 2' is more hilarious while the first film was better in the technical department, e.g. the cinematography and the presentation as a whole was more striking to me!Overall, 'Lethal Weapon 2' is a more than worthy sequel that is (at least) on par with the first film due to hilarious moments and fun written all over it! 6/10",Lethal Weapon 2

143,crawfrordboon,"""The film that blew James Bond out of the box office in 1989 will blow your mind!""",8,28 January 2005,"Carrying on from where they left off in the original, Mel Gibson and Danny Glover are back with more incredible stunts, machine gun dialogue, and red hot action than ever before. Reprising their 'good cop, mad cop' routine, except with a greater emphasis on the lighter side of Riggs's character, the comedy is enhanced further by the significant adaptation to the series of pint-sized motor-mouth Leo, played by Joe Pesci (Raging Bull). Along with the full set of characters introduced in the original, such as the police chief, the psychiatrist, and Murtagh's family, we are treated to an even greater range of gun fights, car chases, explosive fist fights, and dramatic confrontations as the duo become involved in an investigation into heroin smuggling.The bad guys, who are depicted as stereotypical Afrikaner racists (boo, hiss), are nevertheless played by deliciously by Joss Ackland and Derrick O'Connor, who spit out their dialogue in as guttural and vicious way as possible, accentuating the unusual use of the South African accent (in Hollywood, anyway) to create characters immediately identifiable as villains, but whom it can be great to imitate anyway! The actual 'plot' of the drug runners hiding behind diplomatic immunity takes third place to the other two plot strands, as the police come under attack for their intrusion and Leo enters the new treble act with Riggs and Murtagh.Visually, LETHAL WEAPON 2 will always go down as the most memorable of the series, mostly due to the famous 'bathroom scene', which should be textbook material for any writer in how to take a unique dramatic situation, and turn it on its head to create comedy. In effect, that is the entire LETHAL series in a nutshell. We do get another long hard look at the dark side of Martin Riggs, and once again Gibson is completely believable as a man driven to the edge of rationality by his enemies, as he makes a terrible discovery about the death of his wife. Also notable for the appearance of the stunningly beautiful Patsy Kensit who does a great job keeping up with Gibson (why she married Liam Gallagher I can't imagine), the first sequel to LETHAL WEAPON is a worthy successor and in some regards actually succeeds in surpassing its illustrious predecessor.",Lethal Weapon 2

Murtaugh and Riggs - try to pursue drug dealers masking as consulate officers from South Africa. The bust is a failure but they do find some South African Kreugerrand money in one of the suspect's crashed cars, and later on in another bust where cartel member Hans is killed off by a flying surfboard in the accident following another police pursuit.After meeting up with federal drug informant, Leo Getz, Leo tells to those sergeants a bit more about this cartel group who seems to have immunity from prosecution because they are diplomat employees. Both Murtaugh and Riggs find out the hard way that you cannot arrest such drug dealers who have this so-called ""diplomatic immunity"". But Riggs is obsessed with taking the whole cartel down, and the cartel retaliates by rigging Murtaugh in his own house with a C4 bomb bobby trap under his toilet. Riggs and the LAPD bomb squad arrive and find a way to get Murtaugh out of the toilet and dive into a cast-iron tub before the bomb blasts, and both cops live to fight another day.Then, Riggs makes a ruse at the actual consulate site with security so he can make a romance with Rika Van Den Haas, the consulate secretary., with the help of Leo and Murtaugh protesting South African apartheid openly at the consulate before they are kicked out to an awaiting crowd and continue the protest outside. Then Riggs sneaks in and takes away confidential information about Rika's whereabouts, meet up again in a store, and then, eventually move to a private trailer where Riggs is, on the beach.The consulate-cartel is tipped off about the breach and wages revenge on the LAPD, assassinating some of the officers involved in stopping the cartel with planned hits (either through silencer gunfire or terrorist bombs). Murtaugh himself faced two hitmen but he kills both of them with a nail gun before they could kill him, but at the same time, Leo is kidnapped by other cartel members in Murtaugh's station wagon and forces him into their house of stilts far away. Other cartel members do still another planned hit on Riggs' beach trailer in the height of him in passionate love with Rika with automatic machine gun fire, but Riggs's past military training was able to fend off the assassins, and Rika and Riggs - and his dog - all survive unscathed.Riggs then brings Rika back to her private home in his own car, says good bye to her after a bit more romance, but then is pistol whipped by a few cartel members, and shackled near a body of water at a pier. Riggs is eventually thrown into the water and was able to free himself from the chains with a shoulder pop but saw that Rika's neck was broken - the hitmen who threw Riggs in the water did it. Riggs, now in full anger, resurfaces and finds a chain link and was able to use it to kill off one hitman, and then slam another hitman into the car, killing him also. But sadly he had to take the dead Rika all the way back to where his beach trailer was. She is dead - he cannot love him anymore.Riggs now has a death wish on the surviving cartel people in the house of stilts, because Murtaugh knows Leo is captured by them, but not before Riggs found out about how many LAPD the cartel assassinated. Now they realized that immunity they have is now no excuse for that. They go up to the house and was able to rescue Leo and then destroy the house, but not until the cartel enforcer flees. Leo is finally let off by the cops to turn himself in to the Feds to try to take those drug dealers down, even though he displays his torture wounds from the dealers.Finally, the cops go into the shipping yard to one docking area, and spot the cargo ship, Alba Varden, where the cartel was going to use as a escape boat to head to South Africa. The cops try another last bust, finds a trailer near a boat that had drug money but the cartel locks them in the trailer. There is a car inside, and Riggs starts the car after lacing the money in the car's back with gasoline and blasts the car out of the trailer and bursts into flames and dives into the water, making the money useless. The cartel is tipped off and make a final deadly assault on the two cops, and even though Riggs gets badly hurt in the final conflict, they think they killed off the rest of the cartel but Arjen Rudd, armed, comes from behind and shoots Riggs multiple times, wounding him, but Murtaugh answers with a gunshot right into Arjen's head - and it is all over. The danger for them, that is.Murtaugh then goes over and tends to the badly-wounded Riggs as the LAPD backup comes toward the docking area, with sirens flashing. Riggs tries to light a cigarette but Murtaugh tries to keep him from doing that, fearing this could cause a higher change of a wounding death, and then they joke about their victory against those drug dealers masquerading as consulate agents. Scary enough for them.",Lethal Weapon 2
152,hadganraend,A good buddy cop adventure with an amusingly annoying third wheel.,6,14 August 2015,"Detectives Riggs (Mel Gibson) and Murtaugh Danny Glover) are back in this action packed sequel, beginning the movie with a car chase through the streets of Las Angeles. They discover illegal gold coins being transported and stumble into a money laundering scheme by a South African diplomat. Along the way they meet Leo Goetz (Joe Pesci), a former mob moneyman who helps them crack the case.This movie is funny, mainly for the addition of Pesci who delivers some very quotable lines (""They f*** you in the drive-thru!""). Riggs and Murtaugh have changed as well, having adjusted to each other and gained a close friendship and changing the mood from the first movie to a more comedic one, in spite of some horrible events.The action is good and the script was halfway decently written. However, the movement from comedy to action to tragedy all seems jumbled together, like the writers couldn't decide what mood to go for. Mainly, I blame this lack of consistency on the inclusion of Goetz. His character is just made to be laughed at, in spite of murders and bombings happening every which way.In all, it's above average for its time and genre, but not great. The real treat here is the acting. Everyone seems natural in their roles. The good pacing and flow help make the movie watchable and suspend disbelief in spite of the writing.",Lethal Weapon 2
153,94157,A winning formula - better than the original,10,8 December 1999,"When I saw the first Lethal Weapon movie (admittedly I was underaged at the time) I thought a better flick could never be dreamed of.  I was wrong, its all here the chemistry between Glover & Gibson is better than ever, the action is faster and to my lasting surprise the comedy has been much improved.The inclusion of Joe Peschi as the whinny Leo Getz was a master stroke and finally completed the picture.SEE IT!",Lethal Weapon 2
154,Mlinville817,A great sequel to a classic buddy-cop movie,9,21 January 2011,"Mel Gibson and Danny Glover return in a rare sequel that's just about as good as the first. Everything's new; it's not just a rehash. In the movie, to find the bad guy they have to get help of a man named Leo Getz. He's played by by Joe Pesci who is the new addition the movie. He's an accountant who has figured out a foolproof way to launder vast quantities of illegal drug money. He's very funny and is great to watch in every scene he is in.What Riggs and Murtaugh stumble over is a complex plot, never quite explained, by which South African diplomats are dealing illegally in gold and other contraband. It is unclear exactly what their plan is, but they are ruthless in its execution. The action has Murtaugh in the bathroom about to sit up when he finds out if he does a bomb will go off. That scene has Gibson and Glover with their most chemistry. It's pretty funny and dramatic. Also Gibson's trailer being shot up by a helicopter as he escapes is cool. And some pretty good chase sequences.Richard Donner returns as director as he will do in further installments. The only thing I miss is the Mel Gibson being suicidal. I know he really can't be but it was a pretty interesting thing in the first. And for a period of time in the middle Danny Glover is no where to be found and it focuses on Gibson's character. But in all this is darker than the first and with the introduction of Leo Getz this is a really good movie.3 1/2 stars (out of 4)",Lethal Weapon 2
155,djdamato,A good comedy action mix,7,13 February 2002,I thought that this movie like most of the other Lethal Weapon movies was very enjoyable for an action movie.  They are sort of the beginning of the action movies that tie in a little bit of comedy.  I think that Mel Gibson gives a little more of a serious role than in part one.  All of the stunt scenes are realistic which makes for a really good action movie.  And the ending almost completely surprises you.,Lethal Weapon 2
156,oonagimakii,Pure Magic,10,11 February 2003,"The first one was hard core.  It was all about drugs, intrigue and Vietnam. It was also about Riggs' suicidal tendencies.  It was serious.  Too serious. That was awesome.  This one is about a lighter, gentler Riggs.  The same Murtaugh I'm afraid but a lighter gentler Riggs-for a while that is. Reasons why this film is better than the original:  1.  Leo Getz,  2.  Same chemistry but with a tighter bond,  3.  Comic relief,  4.  Truly despicable villains, 5.  Revenge story that pops out of nowhere really (this is quite surprising for a Gibson flick mind you).  This one's the best of the series. Part three was a joke.  Part four...I dunno what the hell that one was. Part one was pure setup baby.  This is the one.  >",Lethal Weapon 2
157,davidjjey,"Some good, but not as much as original (becomes a standard action flick)",6,15 June 2014,"In a nutshell, this has the fun action craziness of the original, further develops the relationship b/w Riggs and Murtaugh, and profitably adds Pesci to the still excellent comedy, but lazy and very unrealistic plot contrivances let it down. It's good that Riggs has grown out of his semi-suicidal state which largely drove him in the first film (since at the very least, he's now got a friend and a defacto family with Murtaugh). But what we're given to replace that feels really cheap and manipulative.What I really didn't like was creating motivation for Riggs by conveniently having him drop his new girlfriend back at her flat for the bad guys to kidnap, and the oh-so-convenient revelation that the same bad guys sadistically killed his former wife (previously thought to be a car accident). Plus killing off the new girlfriend - OK, that's a bit novel since the girl doesn't get saved this time around, but then again it's just used as a way to motivate Riggs (and probably clear the way for a new female in the next movie).Regarding the villains, with the warming relations between Russian and the US, plus the fact the Ruski's had been done to death as movie antagonists, sooner or later racist South Africans were going to be a logical choice as bad guys for this kind of flick (and for what it's worth, I don't believe this film portrays all white South Africans are racist - Patsy Kensit's character is obviously intended to provide some balance on that point). But actually, why stop with using the villains' nasty character as an *excuse* to blow them away? My suggestion.....involve a victim of these guys who is *in South Africa*, and use that as the motivation for Riggs, rather than continuously putting his family/partners/families at risk. Ambitious maybe, but then again, so was the first film, making the hero a guy who quite possibly wasn't mentally stable at all. This sequel defaulted to standard 'good guy must be damaged by bad guys personally in order to kill and blow stuff up' clichés.",Lethal Weapon 2

159,duvel71,"A powerful message? No, rather simplistic",5,11 June 2005,"It's a fun movie, but having lived in South Africa for some time, there's not much that rings true. One user comment said it contained a powerful message for him, since he's black and never quite understood apartheid.Well, if this is what you're going to base your knowledge on, you're very far from the truth. Don't get me wrong, South Africa was racist, and many Afrikaners were rather backward redneck types, but the characters in this movie aren't even caricatures. The actors ham it up with no character research at all.You want to understand South African racism? See Cry the Beloved Country, or something. Lethal Weapon is a cheap action movie. Don't mistake it for something that tries to deliver some deep and meaningful message. It doesn't.Though it is unintentionally ludicrous if you're South African, it's watchable.",Lethal Weapon 2

161,lgarretti049,Enjoyable follow up to the original,6,3 February 2010,"The first Lethal Weapon is not only one of the best cop-buddy movies but it is also by far one of Mel Gibson's best movies. And this second instalment is still a fun ride!The acting is nothing short of excellent. Especially Mel Gibson portrays the deeply disturbed Martin Riggs with great finesse and his ability to create nuanced characters shines through in this movie. You genuinely feel with him and feel the incredible weight of his wife's death on him. Danny Glover is also great in his role as the aging family father. The on-screen chemistry between the two actors is excellent and the relationship between Riggs and Murtaugh has been weighed more heavily than in the following movies that were to come.The action in the movie is excellent for an 80s movie. All in all, a movie where basically everything works and is perhaps underrated by the voters of IMDb.",Lethal Weapon 2
162,streetertracy19,Good action,8,17 March 2012,"What a hard action movie/sequel this is. I had heard nothing very positive about this movie until right before I saw it. I sat down, watched it directly after I watched ""Lethal Weapon,"" and realized just how great of a sequel it really is. It's not repetitive -- it continues the character progression and friendship seen at the end of ""Lethal Weapon,"" while at the same time adding a bit more humor than the first film.One of the things I praise about the first ""Lethal Weapon"" movie is that the characters didn't just suddenly agree to like each other at the end of the movie like so many films. They gradually learned to trust each other throughout the film, adding a sense of true friendship and realism to the film. In ""Lethal Weapon 2,"" the friendship between Martin Riggs and Roger Murtaugh is definitely expanded more to the point where they're best buddies. Most of the time when there is a sequel to a cop-buddy film, the directors and writers are afraid to continue the friendship. They seem to forget the end of the original film, and in the second film the characters hate each other again and the progress of friendship starts all over again. (As seen in such films as ""Another 48 Hrs."") But ""Lethal Weapon 2"" is brave -- it isn't afraid to continue the story. I think that might be part of what makes it such a great, well-rounded series. It never really repeats itself, it always seems eager to move forward and ignore the past. The first film was a humorous, hard cop-buddy film about two opposites learning to trust each other. The second movie is a continuation of their friendship. The third film is almost a full-out comedy. And the fourth film is a tribute to the first three. Darn good film-making here.""Lethal Weapon 2"" is quite possibly one of the best sequels of all time. It avoids repetitions, it avoids cop-buddy clichés, and when it all comes down to it, Mel Gibson and Danny Glover and Joe Pesci are such an amazing trio, that even if this film did follow the routine procedures I'd still love it. And you can't say that about many movies.",Lethal Weapon 2

165,peterpiper1969,South African input,7,27 December 2006,"I liked the movie and did not want it to be tarnished by incorrect understanding of the foreign words used.The Afrikaans phrase ""jou moer"" comes from ""moeder"" which means ""mother"" (it is also an old word for ""baarmoeder"" which means ""womb""). It vaguely refers to the concept of ""your mother"" but is seldom used as the c-word. It is used in a slightly crude but funny and fairly well accepted sense in South Africa.For example: ""moer"" big means ""a mother of a size"". And if you ""moer"" someone, you give them a mother of a beating. ""Jou moer"" is not directly translatable but means something similar to ""screw you"" or ""your ass!"". (""Jou"" means ""your"", not ""you"" in this case). It's only perhaps if you say: Your mother's ""moer""! (if you really corner the word), that you indirectly probably referring to a meaning that it is not usually used for.The truth is no-one knows what it really means anymore, but it's nice to say and a versatile adjective, adverb or verb. It is used by young and old alike, in colloquial conversation, but it would be improper to use it in formal situations.Just a point of interest: the South African actors are unlikely to be real South Africans - judging by their accent. We roll our R's to begin with ,and even English South Africans know how to say ""moer"" properly - it is a short, abrasive word, not like in the movie. But they must have had some South African input none the less.The movie was quite popular in South Africa as Afrikaans seldom features in Hollywood films, let alone slang Afrikaans. So it was fun to watch. Mel Gibson and Danny Glover were a good choice of actors and delivered well. The racial tension issues did not detract from the main storyline - to get the bad guys.",Lethal Weapon 2

167,graemealexanderphillips,The traditional output from the Hollywood Left,1,28 April 2009,"This film has little in the way of artistic merits, but even if it had something in the way of artistic merit, it would be difficult to like this film. It is a traditional film produced by the very smug and self-assured Hollywood Left and the liberal élite portraying white South Africans in favour of the retention of apartheid in a one-sided negative light. This film is sadly just another testament to how Hollywood is full of itself and views itself as being ahead of the curve. When it was conceived, it was not yet known that apartheid was going to fall, although Pieter Botha's government had made some extremely limited reforms. However, given Mr. de Klerk's election in 1989 (the year of the film's release), it suddenly lost its raison d'être. It has some historical accuracy in that sanctions-busting activity took place during the apartheid regime, but drug-smuggling was not among the activities widely practised and the portrayal of South Africa as a gangster state is inaccurate.",Lethal Weapon 2
168,memorysponge,Decent sequel hampered by unnecessary comedy and over-the-top political messaging.,6,18 January 2020,"In 1987, Lethal Weapon was released and was an instant action classic. With Richard Donner's direction, the first movie was an 80's version of The French Connection. Its tight, gritty script was wonderfully annotated by Mel Gibson and Danny Glover's incredible chemistry and realistic ad-libbing. Lethal Weapon 2 had some big shoes to fill.
While LW2 works hard to carry on what the made the original great, it's brought down by what made the original so great: comedy. The first LW had genuinely funny moments. In this sequel, that comedy is forced and not organic. The bad guys, led by Joss Acklund and Derrek O'Connor, are cartoonish and offer no heat other than the apartheid South African government they represent. The story and writing is forced. The political statements throughout are heavy-handed and cringe-worthy at times. (Tuna and Dolphins)
But ultimately, you can't resist angry Mel shooting up thugs with a methodical Danny Glover covering him. The action and violence are there from the first and even ramped up a bit.",Lethal Weapon 2
