0,Leofwine_draca,Does what it says on the tin,3,16 June 2016,"FILTH is the perfect title for this filthy, bottom-of-the-barrel Scottish comedy that comes to us courtesy of the novel by TRAINSPOTTING writer Irvine Welsh. I should make it clear that I consider TRAINSPOTTING to be one of the most overrated films of the 1990s so I had little hopes of enjoying this similarly depraved film either.And I was right: FILTH is everything I hate about modern so-called 'comedies'. It's a film that goes out of its way to offend everyone, with below the belt gags taking in all manner of outrageous situations and depravities. I honestly don't find the material here to be funny in the slightest, but it doesn't surprise me that others crack up at this sort of stuff; I have a very old-fashioned sense of humour.The film is also flawed in presenting us with a protagonist who is so irredeemably corrupt that there's no way he can come back from it, so attempts to make him sympathetic to the viewer just don't work. James McAvoy's character wants stringing up, not praising. The only positive thing I can find about the whole experience is that McAvoy's incredibly dedicated performance is out of this world, and I can only wish he had been employed in a better movie. He's be a perfect fit for Macbeth, for example.",Filth
1,SnoopyStyle,great reprehensible character,7,28 June 2016,"In Edinburgh, Scotland, Detective Sergeant Bruce Robertson (James McAvoy) is obsessed with getting a promotion. His wife Carole has left with their daughter. There is a high profile case of the murder of a Japanese student. Bruce aims to undermine his competition taking advantage of their shortcomings. DS Ray Lennox (Jamie Bell) is the junkie rookie with a small penis. DS Amanda Drummond (Imogen Poots) is a woman. DS Peter Inglis is a metro-sexual. DCI Toal is the boss. DS Peter Inglis is very Scottish. DS Gus Bain is an idiot. Bruce takes advantage of his meek friend Clifford Blades and he's under treatment with Dr. Rossi (Jim Broadbent) for an earlier trauma. He fails to save Mary's husband with CPR and she's grateful for the effort.Bruce Robertson is a great character for McAvoy. He has loads of fun doing some reprehensible things. Jamie Bell is terrific. The murder case bothered me because I kept trying to follow it. The case needs to be a Mcguffin. Showing the murder in the beginning is distracting. The movie is also disjointed with a lot of surreal turns in Bruce's disturbed mind. It's hard to piece some of it together especially with the imaginary Carole. Overall, it's a great character who does some wickedly funny schemes.",Filth
2,Horst_In_Translation,Same rules apply,6,26 October 2013,"Five years after Cass, Jon S. Baird comes up with his second feature film for the big screen, an adaptation of Irvine Welsh's novel ""Filth"". This was truly one shocking movie. It's about a rogue cop on his way to promotion and how his mental illness actually result in demotion, which turns out as the final nail in his coffin. Sometimes, its most extreme moments worked actually pretty well to develop the main character and the story, but sometimes it also added nothing and felt really only included for nothing but shock value. The one scene that comes to mind particularly is when the main character catches an underage girl in sexual activity with a grown man and threatens that he'll tell her (very influential) father unless she gives him a blowjob. So yeah, you get the full program here: vomiting, sex, drugs, violence, murder... However, the suffering of McAvoy's character is occasionally also depicted in a more subtle manner (e.g. when we find out why he became what he is, his previous and possibly next family are referenced or during his video message to his friend near the end) and that's where the film is usually is at its best. Above that, you could certainly make a point that his homophobic, racist and misogynist comments are not really what he is like, but truly more a symptom of being hit metaphorically in the face one time too many.All in all, it's 90 fairly entertaining minutes, but definitely not for the easily offended and I'd like to put special emphasis on Jim Broadbent's hilariously ludicrous portrayal of an insane psychiatrist, which may have been the highlight of the whole thing. The animal effects are completely insane as well and almost shocked me as if in a horror movie when they appeared totally up out of nowhere. The film is nowhere near my favorite works of 2013, but if you liked Keitel's or Cage's ""Bad Lieutenant"" or the more recent ""Sightseers"", this may be exactly your cup of tea and it's probably even one step up in crassness.",Filth
3,Prismark10,One bad cop,6,1 October 2019,"Filth has an energetic performance from James McAvoy but a scatterbrained plot and indicates that as a novelist, Irvine Welsh is a one trick pony.Detective Sergeant Bruce Robertson (James McAvoy) is a corrupt drug addled cop in Edinburgh. A detective on the edge of a nervous breakdown. We sense he has family issues and he in no fit state to be going for a promotion for Inspector.Bruce is investigating the death of a Japanese student and undermining the promotion chances of his colleagues by fair means and foul.Set in the same grimy underbelly of Edinburgh as Trainspotting. Filth tries too hard to be a bizarre surreal dark comedy. With that title it has its share of bad language, sex and violence, it also has David Soul popping up singing Silver Lady! What Filth does not have is a coherent plot and likeable characters. It also been done before in other films such as Bad Lieutenant.",Filth
4,nogodnomasters,starsIT'S GREAT TO BE SCOTTISH,8,16 October 2018,"Bruce Robinson (James McAvoy) is working for a promotion. The film starts with some first person narration as we see Bruce as the idea man for the job. However we soon discover that Bruce is out of control and works to destroy his fellow detectives in order to ensure he gets the promotion. As Bruce spirals down in his psychotic world, the film becomes darker. This dark comedy had scenes which gave me flashbacks to ""Clockwork Orange"" although the films really have nothing in common. And oh yes, they are looking for the killers of a Japanese male student.This quirky film features ample helping of sex and nudity.",Filth
5,kosmasp,Not passing the Law,8,2 June 2014,"Both ""Laws"" that is. The actual one and the actor one. But this is still incredible and without having watched Dom Hemingway you might find this even better than the 8 points I gave it. I'm not going to compare those movies, just let me say that both main characters are despicable. The one played by McAvoy here might seem like the one with lesser evils at first though.And you have to stay through to get the whole story, but it's too much fun not to root for him. It's the evil ones that get our attention and maybe that is saying something about the human race too. But the acting is really great here and there is ""real"" tragedy to be found. Not surprising tragedy I'd say, but tragic nonetheless. And while you might be able to predict a couple of things, this still is a ride that you will both cherish and hate ...",Filth
6,lee_eisenberg,this is as close as you can get to a Quentin Tarantino movie without it being a Tarantino movie,10,19 October 2014,"""Filth"" is from ""Trainspotting"" author Irvine Welsh. If you remember what the latter was like, then you'll have an inkling of what this movie is like. And believe you me, ""Filth"" features every type of debauchery known to humanity. James McAvoy's corrupt, vicious, manipulative cop makes you feel as if you're walking on eggshells, but you still gotta love him. Throughout much of the movie I couldn't understand what the characters were saying. These are some THICK Scottish accents.Basically, there's everything to like about this movie. It's a tour of Edinburgh consisting of sex, drugs, and more! There are times when I started wondering if it was even appropriate for me to enjoy the movie, but trust me, even the most WTF scenes are there for a perfectly good reason. Really good.Also starring Jamie Bell (Tintin in ""The Adventures of Tintin""), Jim Broadbent (Horace Slughorn in the Harry Potter movies) and Shirley Henderson (Moaning Myrtle in the Harry Potter movies).",Filth
7,jboothmillard,Filth,6,29 October 2013,"The only film I had seen previously based on a novel by prolific author Irvine Welsh was the great Trainspotting (also the first to be adapted), so I was intrigued to hear about this one, and the trailer certainly made it look like my kind of film. Basically in Edinburgh Detective Sergeant Bruce Robertson (James McAvoy) is scheming, bigoted, manipulative and corrupt policeman, and he will stop at nothing to secure his chances for the promotion to to Detective Inspector, but he may be indulging too much in hard drinking, abusive sex and hallucinogenic drugs. Robertson has this chance when he is assigned to investigate the murder of a Japanese student, and while he follows the clues for this he continues to ""plays games"", hatching foul plots of hateful abuse against his colleagues, and taking advantage of and bullying his ""friend"", mild mannered Clifford 'Bladesey' Blades (The World's End's Eddie Marsan), including prank calling his wife Bunty (Shirley Henderson). Working the case along with drinking and taking drugs he is losing grip on reality, suffering severe hallucinations, his mental health may be in fact turning into insanity, it is revealed in fact, through dream sequences with his psychiatrist Dr. Rossi (Jim Broadbent) that he suffers bipolar disorder, and is taking medication for this. Robertson is also tormented with the guilt of accidentally murdering his brother in childhood, and his wife has clearly left him for another man, as well as denying him access to his daughter, this is part of his motivation to get the promotion, and the twist also comes when it is revealed he dresses in drag, becoming his wife, wanting to ""keep her close to him"". He is caught one night wandering the street dressed this way by gang who committed the murder, he was the witness seen when it happened, but he did not report to avoid the discovery of his transvestism and mental problems, he is beaten badly by them, but he manages to kill the leader, who is found by his colleagues. Robertson is demoted to Constable, reassigned to uniform, Clifford is seen watching his apology video, and in the end Robertson plans to commit suicide, hanging him standing and dropping from a chair, but he sees a woman and child knocking at the door, but the chair slips under him. Also starring Jamie Bell as Ray Lennox, Imogen Poots as Amanda Drummond, Joanne Froggatt as Mary, Emun Elliott as Peter Inglis, Martin Compston as Gorman, Gary Lewis as Gus Bain, Shauna Macdonald as Carole Robertson, The Iron Lady's John Sessions as Bob Toal, Brian McCardie as Dougie Gillman, Iain De Caestecker as Ocky, Kate Dickie as Chrissie, David Soul as Punter, Pollyanna McIntosh as Size Queen, Ron Donachie as Hector and Tracy Ann Oberman as Diana. In the leading role McAvoy is great being sinister and cruel but at the same time vulnerable, the rest of the cast are well chosen for their roles, with Henderson and Broadbent getting their humorous scenes, this is politically incorrect and full of shocking and unpleasant material, but then that is the intention, and there are many moments that made me laugh, it might not be for everyone, but for me it was a terrific comedy drama. Good!",Filth
8,Theo Robertson,Irvine Welsh On The Road To Redemption,6,14 April 2015,"An on the edge , corrupt cop is heading towards meltdown . His wife has left him , he faces fierce rivalry for promotion but when a murder takes place it offers him the opportunity to achieve his ambitions and better himself as a human being Reading the above synopsis you'll instantly be reminded of Abel Ferrara's 1992 film BAD LIEUTENANT . It's an obvious redemption plot and being based on a novel by Irvine Welsh and so takes place in the Welsh style . I've never been a fan of Welsh finding him both one note and parochial featuring stories that revolve around Edinburgh lowlife . Lumpen proletarian fantasy marketed for the non Edinburgh bourgeois masses . That said if you're watching a film in Edinburgh and the setting of the film is Edinburgh then at least you can entertain yourself by playing spot the location and in its favour this film has an anti-hero who shares the same surname as me FILTH plays out very much as you'd expect it to . James McAvoy plays DS Bruce Robertson who is after promotion , drugs and casual sex and is a truly dreadful human being . That said McAvoy brings an empathy to the character and as the redemption part of narrative comes to the fore I did warm to him . If there's a problem with it then it's because it is a story by Irvine Welsh and Jon S Baird fails to disguise this enough . The first half is a bit too loose and we get the usual stylistic stuff you saw in TRAINSPOTTING as in voice over followed by jump cuts to drug taking and hardcore intensive naughty sex . Obviously this is used merely to shock the audience but in an era where terrorists murder aid workers and prisoners of war by cutting off heads with kitchen knives or burning them alive is an audience shocked by people sticking powder up their nose or having casual sex ? It's not like they're hurting other people is it ? It also comes across as crass and juvenile on the part of Welsh and oh so predictable . This is a pity because FILH has its moments even though it's rather uneven and the second half is much better than the first",Filth
9,grantss,"Great, riveting movie",8,22 January 2015,"Great, riveting movie.The fact that Irvine Welsh, who wrote Trainspotting, wrote the book for this movie should let you know what you're in for. Like Trainspotting, Filth is a surreal experience that picks up pace and gets more bizarre as it goes on.Starts off rather sedately, intriguingly and comically, as it seems to be about the politics of getting a promotion in the police force. Some of the machinations are hilariously funny.However, as it goes on it turns out to be much more than that. It gets a lot darker, and more abstract.It does lose coherence at times, which is a downside to it being so bizarre, and there are a few plot holes and implausibilities. Plus the big twist isn't that original (Fight Club and American Psycho sprang to mind). However, it is very entertaining.Superb performance by James McAvoy in the lead role. I never really had much regard for him before as he seemed to act in such dull or conventional sorts of roles. Here he is brilliant, with a performance that requires him to be debonair, scheming, wise- cracking and funny, and over-the-top insane. He pulls it off with ease and goes a long way to making the movie as good as it is.",Filth
10,neil-476,Never was a film better named,8,11 October 2013,"Bruce Robertson is an Edinburgh policeman. Once a good man and a good copper, he is now spiralling into addiction and corruption as he plots against his fellow officers with a view to securing a forthcoming promotion.James McAvoy is Robertson in this adaptation of Irvine Welsh's novel. While it sounds like a drama, and there is undoubtedly a dramatic thrust to the plot, this is primarily a very, very, black comedy. The supporting cast is eclectic and excellent, and the direction of this sometimes surrealistic piece is imaginative and striking.It is quite explicit in terms of language, drugs and sex but, given the subject matter, that is inevitable. Besides, where else do you get a chance to listen to Harry Potter's Moaning Myrtle (Shirley Henderson) talking dirty to an obscene telephone call in that breathy, helium-fuelled voice?",Filth

When their good, their very good (Trainspotting), and when they are bad, Ironically their Ecstasy.What we have here is one mans life spiralling out of control in front of our very eyes, and while it's a wonderful movie with a never better Mcavoy, it can sometimes be depressing and make you fell like you are coming down from a substance of some kind.Released around the same time as 'Sunshine on Leith', 'Filth' displays Scotland as an unfriendly, unkind place to be, and this adds depth to the array of characters.And what characters they are. Like Trainspotting, they all appear normal on the surface, but after the hilarious introduction, we start to see their traits as the cracks start to show.It's easy to get lost in the characters rather than the narrative, so every now and again, the makers have decided to put a subliminal sign in the film to remind the viewers what the main plot points are.All in all, it's refreshing, lively, with a brilliant twist come the end.But it will leave you feeling 'Filthy'.And Frank Sidebottom will never be the same....",Filth
12,gradyharp,'Sometimes it takes a wrongdoer to show you when you are doing wrong.',6,31 May 2014,"There are several reasons for considering watching this film about a possible hero's descent into madness and despair – a book and screenplay by Irving Welsh ('Trainspotting'), and Jon S. Baird who seems to be rising as a writing an directing and producing talent to watch, and the brilliant actor James McAvoy who continues to impress with a wide range of roles. What doesn't work so well is the 97 minutes of unmitigated coarse material and activity and the ruthlessness of the abuse of the individual that is performed by a primarily Scottish cast with brogues so thick that without subtitles about 90% of the film is inaccessible (not that that is a bad thing in the end)The promo for the film describes the 'story' best: 'Scheming Bruce Robertson (James McAvoy), a bigoted and corrupt policeman, is in line for a promotion and will stop at nothing to get what he wants. Enlisted to solve a brutal murder and threatened by the aspirations of his colleagues, including Ray Lennox (Jamie Bell), Drummond (Imogen Poots), Bladesey (Eddie Marsan), Inglis (Emun Elliott) etc, Bruce sets about ensuring their ruin, right under the nose of unwitting Chief Inspector Toal (John Sessions). As he turns his colleagues against one another by stealing their wives (Shirley Henderson unrecognizable gussied up in wigs, Kate Dickie, Joanne Froggart) and exposing their secrets, Bruce starts to lose himself in a web of deceit that he can no longer control. His past is slowly catching up with him, and a missing wife Carole (Shauna Macdonald), a crippling drug habit and suspicious colleagues start to take their toll on his sanity. The question is: can he keep his grip on reality long enough to disentangle himself from the filth?Despite a brilliant acting turn from James McAvoy, a film that celebrates murder, phone sex, police corruption, casual frequent fellatio, crude (when understood) language, etc will have a very limited and likely not a long lasting appeal.",Filth
13,siderite,"Amazing acting by McAvoy, but not so easy a film",8,30 January 2014,"Remember when Ewan McGregor played in a little movie called Trainspotting? The film was made after a book by Scottish writer Irvine Welsh and it was an intense and often funny window into the complete wasting of human life due to heroin. It made McGregor famous.Now, James McAvoy has no need to be made famous, he already is, and he showed he is a great actor in several movies; he is on a roll. But in this film, also made from an Irvine Welsh book, he really outdid himself, playing a deranged police inspector torn apart by addiction, grief and madness.The film itself is difficult to explain and, perhaps, it would be more clear to me if I would have read the book first. Some of the characters I have no idea who they were and why he was interacting with them in the first place. Also the ending is pretty much the antithesis of the one in Trainspotting. Here, there is no hope.The direction was good, I guess, as well as the general production values. A bunch of known, but usually secondary actors fill the cast, with often interesting results, but let's face it, the film is mostly a one man show and McAvoy was up for the job. I just wish the story would have been less confusing.Conclusion: it would be a shame not to watch this film, even if you end up not liking it for some reason. You need to be familiar with Scottish accents or use a subtitle to get what people are saying. Other than that, great work, James!",Filth
14,KineticSeoul,"You might need a bit of ""empathy"" to get the full effect out of this",8,29 May 2014,"This is a movie that I just thought was passable, but after taking the time to think about it some more...I personally think this is a great movie. Yeah, some parts just seem a bit too over the top when it comes to the protagonist with the exaggerated acting which in a way somehow adds value to this movie. James McAvoy really does put everything he has for this flick, and he is getting better with the accents he tries to pull off. As a cop that is spiraling downward and relies on sex, drugs and alcohol to turn away from reality. While setting up one goal in mind which he feels would lead to his happiness, which is to get promoted to detective inspector. Because he feels that would set his life straight. It's difficult to feel sympathy for a character like him because of his hypocritical, manipulative and abusive attitude towards his colleagues. I just had more sympathy for Woody Harrelson's character in ""Rampart"" (which makes this movie seems like a Scottish version of that film, except with a LOT of hallucinations). The humor in this movie worked sometimes and other times it doesn't, since I felt that it relies heavily on exaggerated emotions to convey something. However by the end of this movie I did feel for the guy and overall it was actually a engraving experience that could actually feel for overall. This is a twisted, fast-paced flick with mayhem that some people will like and other regular mainstream audiences might be turned off by. This movie does have balls when it comes to it's directions (I mean that literally as well).8.3/10",Filth
15,Hellmant,I think I'm a little crazy too.,8,25 June 2014,"'FILTH': Four Stars (Out of Five)A Scottish crime drama/comedy flick based on the 1998 book (of the same name) by Irvine Welsh (who also wrote the immensely popular 1993 novel 'Trainspotting'). The film was directed and written by Jon S. Baird and stars James McAvoy. It costars Jamie Bell, Eddie Marsan, Imogen Poots and Jim Broadbent. It's funny and manic but also very disgusting and truly leaves the viewer feeling dirty at times. Definitely an interesting and wild ride though. McAvoy plays Bruce Robertson; a drug addicted and alcoholic corrupt cop, in Edinburgh, who's obsessed with his ex-wife Carole (Shauna Macdonald). Carole left Bruce, with their daughter, and now he thinks the only way to win them back is to get a promotion, to Detective Inspector, at work. To do so he thinks he must humiliate, and ruin the reputation, of all of his coworkers. There really is no low he'll go to in order to reach this objective. We watch how truly disturbed Robertson is but at the same time we see glimmers of hope and compassion in him (especially when he thinks back on a young brother he lost). The film is yet another story centering on mental illness; in this film the character is said to be bipolar (but it seems like a pretty severe case of it). This is definitely a popular subject matter in movies and music (in just about any form of art really) I think because most really talented artists are mentally ill; to varying degrees but usually the more talented an artist is the more crazy they are. I think I'm a little crazy too so I never get tired of seeing films (or hearing songs) about it. I think this is a pretty good one; McAvoy is outstanding in the lead and it's superbly directed. Maybe it's a little exaggerated but if it's made by crazy people I think that's to be expected.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6LTWP49XBs",Filth
16,wellthatswhatithinkanyway,Visually striking and anarchically perfect,10,30 July 2015,"STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning Seargent Bruce Robertson (James McAvoy) is angling for promotion to Detective Chief Inspector, and is prepared to cross any line to get it. Inhibiting the morally depraved world he does, Robertson sinks to any low and crosses ever more blurry lines to get what he wants, or just to save his own skin. But a case has just come up where he'll have to prove his worth, involving a murdered Chinese student, while the drama around him and the mental demons tearing at his soul threaten to explode in to action.A few decades after Trainspotting made the massive cultural impact it did, another of Irvine Welsh's sordid works has been given the big screen treatment. Transferring the flashy, shotgun style of that film to the narrative of a detective story, what we have here is primarily a character study of a man who's pretty much beyond flawed, to the point of being utterly despicable. Just when we think we've seen the worst of his excesses, he astounds us by sinking even lower and finding himself in a pathological trap he can't get out of. But we come to learn he's a man so tormented by his demons, he simply won't allow or doesn't feel comfortable allowing the decency and humanity to the surface when he's so convinced he's as evil as sin.Despite a lot of heavy themes, it balances the tense drama by deriving every ounce of black humour it can from the proceedings, with McAvoy's voice overs revealing Robertson's most outrageous and depraved inner-most thoughts, and bringing them visually to life in the most striking and disgusting way. It's at it's darkest and most borderline dramatic during Robertson's hallucinatory sessions with a fuzzy haired Jim Broadbent, stalking him and tormenting him through his subconscious, trying to probe him about his dead little brother. This is the crux for a lot of sharp moments when Bruce sees characters in the shape of their personalities, by way of phantom like gargoyles, which, as the film's only fault, get on your nerves sometimes, appearing out of nowhere with their sudden, shrieking cries.This is a collision course of different styles, from dark character study, to detective thriller, to black comedy, with a sharp, catchy soundtrack listing that keeps things going, and an impressive supporting cast, including Jamie Bell, Eddie Marsan and Imogen Poots amongst others. But it somehow all comes together and works, a flashy, vibrant, fun, outrageous concoction, that proves Trainspotting wasn't some pithy one off. *****",Filth
17,bowmanblue,28 clockwork trainspotters,8,12 August 2014,"As the title 'Filth,' suggests, this film is about the police in Britain (or Scotland to be precise). However, perhaps the main thing you should know about it before you choose to watch it, is that it's written by Trainspotting's Irvine Welsh. So, if you enjoyed Trainspotting then you'll probably appreciate this.James McAvoy plays a (hopefully not average) police officer who lies, cheats, steals, takes drugs and is generally an unpleasant person (think 'Renton' from Trainspotting, but with a badge). And we join him as he tries to scheme his way to a promotion by framing all those colleagues he perceives as a threat. And he does a great job of basically carrying the film single-handedly. Some people have even said his performance is worthy of an Oscar. I'm not sure it was that great, but it's still pretty good anyway.It's quite a mess of a film, but seemingly all the better for it. Because of the 'drug-taking' aspect and the hallucinations caused by such pursuits, there are many weird, wonderful and not particularly linier scenes thrown into the mix, all of which contribute to the madness our central anti-hero is suffering.And, of course, 'Filth' is – as the name indicates – pretty damn filthy, specialising in a particularly adult form of black comedy and drama. Expect much sex and debauchery at every turn. If you combined Renton from Trainspotting and Alex from a Clockwork Orange, then put them in a film which was a combination of the two and set it to the background score from 28 Days Later, then you'll get 'Filth.' If you like the sound of that sort of thing then give Filth a go.http://thewrongtreemoviereviews.blogspot.co.uk/",Filth

21,Bored_Dragon,Where's Oscar for McAvoy?,8,16 December 2018,"If you like ""Trainspotting"", you'll love this one. ""Filth"" is also an adaptation of Irvine Welsh's novel and, although the stories do not have much in common, the movies share a specific atmosphere that will pin you to the screen. Its name fits perfectly, because the film is uncompromisingly dirty. James McAvoy plays a corrupt police detective who would stop at nothing to get his promotion. But behind the mask of a self-confident macho chauvinist, there are hidden secrets that the movie gradually unfolds, up to the totally wicked twist at the end. Although McAvoy's character is almost utterly bad guy, his rude and ruthless charm will mesmerize you and make you be on his side all the time, even when his behavior is inexcusably brutal. In addition to his undoubted acting talent, Mcavoy dedicated himself to the credibility of his performance, so he drank lots of whiskey in order to make his role of heavy alcoholic and drug addict more convincing. His transformations throughout the film, and the powerful expressions of psychological states and emotions of his character definitely deserve an Oscar. Although the film is full of insane moments, surreal scenes and filthy humor, ""Filth"" is primarily a powerful and shocking drama about a man who is falling apart inside, but whose life thought him that he must not show it. The film brings this phenomenon to surreal extremes, but essentially it is something with which many of us can identify, and I think that's precisely what makes McAvoy's character rather antihero than a villain, and what makes us sympathize with him.8/10I would just like to mention the remarkable performance of Jim Broadbent, whose surrealistic scenes make this film even more bizarre, and if you pay attention, you may notice tributes to Stanley Kubrick's cult films ""A Clockwork Orange"" and ""Odyssey"".",Filth
22,sol-,We all have our flaws,7,1 April 2017,"Intent on landing a much coveted promotion, a corrupt cop sets out to tarnish the reputation of his fellow officers he is competing against in this briskly paced and energetic if vulgar comedy set in modern day Scotland. James McAvoy is excellent in the lead role, playing the part with enough charm and charisma that he remains likable to the end, even when he does some pretty horrible things. Flawed as his character may be, he is a relatable human being throughout, always more interested in reconciling matters with his wife through the promotion as opposed to the pay raise. As the film progresses, we also see increasing snippets that reveal a fragile, fragmented psychology with Jim Broadbent highly memorable (if over-the-top) as a 'Clockwork Orange' style psychiatrist treating him in a series of dream sequences. The film nevertheless loses it way a little towards the end. There is a thought-provoking twist late in the piece, but it is spelled out through an overload of flashbacks. The movie additionally concludes on a sentimental note that goes completely against the grain of the tale until then. Generally speaking though, this is an awesome ride, only ever as outrageous as its protagonist's wild schemes to undermine his associates are. Irvine Welsh's dialogue often sparkles with wit and McAvoy is supported by a great cast including Eddie Marsan at his most milquetoast.",Filth
23,tomgillespie2002,A very good adaptation of a difficult novel,7,22 February 2014,"I wanted to get through this entire review without mentioning Trainspotting (1996). But Danny Boyle's British classic was so brimming with dark energy and so tapped in to the Zeitgeist of the 1990's that comparisons are unavoidable when faced with a movie adaptation of an Irvine Welsh novel. The problem with the adaptations that followed Trainspotting - The Acid House (1998) and Ecstasy (2011) - were that they were so caught up in recapturing the spirit and iconic imagery of Trainspotting, that they failed to find a tone of their own, and as a result, were very bad films indeed. Thankfully, with the adaptation of Welsh's most difficult novel, Filth, director Jon S. Baird has found of a verve of his own, and has entrusted much of the film's success to lead star James McAvoy, who is uniformly excellent.Repulsive bipolar Edinburgh Detective Sergeant Bruce Robinson (McAvoy) spends his time drinking, snorting, shagging and bullying his way through life. When he's not being the despicable racist, homophobic and misogynistic bully that he is, he indulges in what he calls 'the games' - a collection of sociopathic manipulations he projects onto his colleagues and rivals for the upcoming promotion to Detective Inspector. His best friend is soft-spoken doormat Bladesey (Eddie Marsan), a wealthy fellow Freemason who is married to Bunty (Shirley Henderson), a bored housewife who Bruce regularly makes prank phone calls to in the voice of Frank Sidebottom.There isn't much defining plot to the film, and instead simply follows Bruce on his various self-destructive exploits, such as having rough sex with the wife of a work colleague, forcing an under-age girl to perform oral sex on him or stealing a suspect's inhaler only to repeatedly blow cigarette smoke in his face as a form of effective interrogation. The movie begins with the murder of a Japanese student by a gang of punks led by Gorman (Martin Compston), and Bruce is assigned to the case by his boss Toal (John Sessions). It gives the film a story to build around, but it features very little, and instead we are forced to witness the complete mental deterioration of a truly disturbed, utterly depraved, yet - thanks to McAvoy - highly charismatic man.If you're easily offended, then this isn't the film for you. Shockingly, the film tones down Bruce's character from Welsh's book, knowing that without a narrator, Bruce could have been so off-putting that he could be beyond audience redemption. So, with McAvoy giving absolutely everything to the role, his bullying and manipulations, regardless of how evil and cruel they are, are hilarious. Knowing his work partner Ray Lennox (Jamie Bell) has a tiny penis, he suggests everyone in the office photocopy their penis and have the girls match the genitalia to the face. The camera pans from penis to self-satisfied face, only to pass Lennox, his face in his hands.But Filth certainly has its share of dark moments too. As more about Bruce is revealed throughout the film, the clearer his mental illness becomes. Only rookie Amanda Drummond (Imogen Poots) can really see through his outlandish antics, and with her being a woman and all, that drives Bruce even crazier. In the novel, Bruce has a tapeworm growing inside of him that narrates a lot of the book, revealing to the reader more about Bruce's history, but for the film this has been changed to some hallucinatory episodes with his doctor Rossi (Jim Broadbent). These moments didn't work for me, as they seemed forced and trying to recapture some of the 'cold turkey' stylings of Trainspotting, as well are interrupting the manic pace.While the ending (which is also different from the book) may be a little too much for some people to take, it is certainly consistent with the fast-paced, twisted energy of the movie's first half. It is tragic, amusing and pathetic, much like Bruce himself. Filth is daring cinema, especially for a dark British movie that doesn't revolve around football hooliganism or Danny Dyer. It doesn't try to be forcefully iconic or deliberately provocative, instead relying on and trusting Welsh's twisted and socially aware text. It also has a fine cast to boot, lining up one of the finest displays of British (mainly Scottish) talent in recent memory. It's far too dark a film to grab the attention of the Academy, but McAvoy, an actor I had never really taken to, deserves every award under the sun for his unflinching performance, and Filth deserves to be talked about without a single reference to Trainspotting.www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com",Filth
24,eddie_baggins,"An absoulte blast of fresh air, one of McAvoy's best performances",7,6 April 2014,"Look, if you think you've seen bad law enforcement officers before think again! For they have nothing on Scotsman Bruce Robertson. Bruce is a man that makes Harvey Keital's titular lieutenant look like Mother Theresa or Woody Harrelsen's David Brown like some type of petty crook, make no doubt about it people for better or worse Bruce Robertson runs Filth and makes Jon S. Baird's seriously dark tale a must watch no matter how deep down the rabbit hole it goes.A role unlike anything else in James McAvoy's CV allows the actor to produce what could well be his most committed and intense performance of his career. There is barely a scene in the film that doesn't feature McAvoy and the range of emotions and scenarios he finds himself in takes a special performance to pull off, but he nails it. Bruce is tormented both internally (in the form of a particularly nasty tape worm amongst other things) and outwardly by his obsession with getting a promotion and generally backstabbing anyone he can to make sure this comes to fruition. That Bruce becomes likable somehow is beyond all better judgement but McAvoy pulls it off and even though his character does some truly despicable things (an early scene involving a young teen springs to mind) it never seems like there is not a glimmer of humanity left within. Other actors in the piece all do fine jobs with the ever reliable Jamie Bell good as fellow lawman Ray Lennox and the always fantastic Eddie Marsan as nebbish accountant Bladesey a continual highlight of the picture.Director Jon S. Baird obviously relishes adapting Trainspotting author Irvine Welsh's darkly comic material and his direction of Filth showcases a great energy and feel for the original source. The editing, the loud and varied music choices that complete the tone and the script all seem perfectly handled which is a minor miracle considering just how morally bankrupt a lot of the picture is. It's also a brave decision by Baird to not sugar-coat any of the themes within the movie and never manipulating the audience to feel sympathy for Bruce but merely just grabbing them by the throat and asking them to stare straight into the soul of a troubled man.Not everything in Filth works and in many ways it could be seen as a slight tale but when it gets it right it's thoroughly entertaining in all the wrong ways and features a wildly inspired performance from James McAvoy who of late has been wafting through some pretty mundane roles.

25,leonblackwood,Funny in a weird sort of way. 4/10,4,16 February 2014,"Review: This movie was very hard to follow. Half of the time, I didn't have a clue what the hell was going on or what they were saying. When the whole plot unfolds, I was still bloody confused, even though there was a hidden story underneath all of the madness. The performances wasn't bad but I just thought that the movie was over complicated. James McAvoy really does pull out all of the stops with his character, who has some serious personal issues, but the whole movie is forgettable after you've watched it. Average!Round-Up: I honestly think that James McAvoy is trying to show a different side to his acting skills with this movie because, in some ways, he is actually the bad guy for once. Some of the scenes were quite shocking and weird which makes you think that the character is off the wall. To be honest, it wasn't what I expected. I hadn't heard anything about the movie, but after seeing the advert, I was expecting a comedy about dirty cops, which it is in some ways, but it does have some depth. Budget: $5million Worldwide Gross: N/AI recommend this movie to people who are into there Scottish cop movies with wit and depth. 4/10",Filth
26,TheMovieDiorama,Filth substitutes witty dialogue for vulgarity.,7,6 March 2018,"The first few minutes were shown and I slowly sinked into my seat thinking ""...this is going to be one of those films isn't it?"". Yet despite the obscene use of sex, drugs and alcohol there is actually a sympathetic undertone. A detective sergeant increasingly experiences hallucinations whilst investigating the murder of a Japanese student, in doing so he is aiming for a promotion to detective inspector. An adaptation of a novel written by Irvine Welsh can only mean two things: It involves drugs and is set in Scotland. Whilst this does not have the same controversial aftershock that 'Trainspotting' made back in 96', it's still unpleasantly warped and enthusiastic in the demented characters it creates. Yes, our ""protagonist"" is a bully and can only be summed up as the worst detective in all of Scotland, but there is a saddening reason for his inhumane behaviour. A reason that surprisingly compelled me and made the entire third act extremely interesting and enthralling. The tonal shift from what seemed to be pointless ribaldry to then become a character study felt seamless to which I have to give credit to director Baird. James McAvoy possibly gives the best performance of his career and Eddie Marsan is always captivating. Him dancing to Darude's Sandstorm whilst being completely off his face was a beauty to behold. Would've liked to have seen more from Jamie Bell and Imogen Poots who only got to shine rarely during the runtime, but this is purely focussed on McAvoy to which he dominates the screen. The screenplay needed some finesse, just to add the needed additional characterisation and memorability that the film ultimately required. It could've been both crude and intelligently written. The narrative is rather messy during the first two acts, jumping from scene to scene like an Olympic athlete on Speed. It is jarring and will take time to adjust, however this is a brilliantly acted crime comedy that lavishes in its own vulgarity. Not many films live up to their title, but Filth does!",Filth
27,l_rawjalaurence,Vivid Depiction of the Corrupt Underbelly of Contemporary Urban Life,7,3 November 2014,"FILTH is one of those films that will divide viewers in terms of response. Set in contemporary Edinburgh, it concerns the efforts of cop Bruce Robertson (James McAvoy) to secure promotion by fair means or foul. This plot-line merely provides the springboard for a penetrating examination into his corrupt state of mind. The word ""filth"" as used in this film is ambiguous; it not only refers to the police force as a whole (""filth"" being a British colloquialism) but also describes the state of Robertson's mind. As portrayed by director John S. Baird, Robertson cannot separate the corruption of his mind from the corruption in the outside world. He is caught within his own web of deceit; a world where infidelity is standard practice, where taking drugs is rife, where so-called ""criminals"" get routinely beaten up, and where he is routinely suspicious of his fellow-competitors for the promotion. There are some memorable sequences to suggest his inner turmoil: one involving a tapeworm suggests that, like Hamlet, corruption is gradually seeping into his soul. On several occasions we see pig-images; again, director Baird plays on the ambiguity of the term, with ""pig"" being another euphemism for the police as well as an animal that digs around with its snout in the swill of life.FILTH contains a suggestive intertext - on at least three occasions it references FRANK, the television show starring ""Frank Sidebottom"" that spawned a movie of its own FRANK (2014). The allusion is significant, as it reminds us of the thin dividing-line between madness and sanity that pervades Robertson's mind: what he perceives as ""sane"" behavior in his terms might be considered ""mad"" elsewhere. In fact, this same distinction could be applied to the world he inhabits, where ""good"" characters seem to be routinely abused and ""bad"" characters reign supreme. Bladesey (Eddie Marsan) leads a blameless life, but he is routinely cuckolded by his wife (Shirley Henderson) and treated with disdain by Robertson. In the end, however, Robertson fails to secure promotion and ends up a forlorn figure, rejected by his wife (Shauna Macdonald) and daughter (Megan Finn). There is one significant sequence taking place in a supermarket, where he tries to talk to a woman and her son whom he has recently encountered; however they are seen to move quickly out of the right of the frame, almost as if they do not want to be seen in his company. FILTH neither offers an optimistic nor a pessimistic end; but rather suggests that this is the norm in contemporary urban life - people live isolated, alienated lives, unable (or perhaps unwilling) to disentangle the ""good"" from the ""bad.""The direction is brisk and suggestive, with a particularly clever use of musical excerpts. With its consistent bad language and violence, FILTH might not be to everyone's taste, but it is a memorable film.",Filth
28,videorama-759-859391,"One man's self destruction, enfoced by Mr Mcevoy",7,20 December 2013,"Like Choke, here's another tale of a man on a path of self destruction. Although both films are poles apart, here's a story of a man whose got real problems and may'be it's too late. Of course, refusing to acknowledge, he's got problems, bi polar junkie cop (McEvoy) basically lives a life of debauchery, whether drinking, taking drugs, phone stalking, forcing a minor to give oral, and other illicit acts. And too he's in line for a promotion, so he must play it cool, but also rob his competition, including his younger, less experienced and savvy partner, Bell. Mcevoy is an acting force to be reckoned with, carrying the film beautifully with his range of emotions, and very realistic portrayal of a man crumbling. As not really foillowing much of this actor, here he reigns supreme. Again, of course we feel we must sympathize, and as being around this track many times before, I really didn't want to, this time, but as the movie progressed, he finally had me. What came as quite a shock, is we learn that he had an ex wife and kid. He's a mess, but to add to it, he's put in charge of a case, involving a young Asian kid, pounced to death, by a gang of ruffian youths, the leader, who justly got what he deserved near the end, I was howling with cheer inside, that's after their little kissing session. I didn't expect the film to be this serious, and there are some funny moments, some scenes totally off the radar, quite frankly they were trash, but of course, essential to Mcevoy's problems. The photocopying penis scene by all our law folk, Mcevoy cheating of course, was another originally daring moment to the film. What I particularly liked too, was the friendship Mcevoy struck up, with a geeky unconfident governor, who Mcevoy's character, describes as ""his one and only friend"", which is true. This is the husband of the semi hot wife, Mcevoy's stalking, and she loves it. He's a very lonely man with serious problems, and w'ere left during the movie, in avid curiosity to wonder how his fate will turn out, as like in Choke or particularly Shame, if you can remember. Filth is a long way from Trainspotting, but I very much recommend to the arty film connoisseur, or maybe people who are drug dependant, as the way Mcevoy's life has turned out, is not all that rosy. Stay watching the film, for the end credit animation sequence.",Filth
29,Vartiainen,Delivers exactly what the title would suggest,8,2 August 2014,"A character study, a film about a single man, carried by a single actor. Which is in no way a bad thing. Filth belongs to James McAvoy and his transforming performance as Bruce, a mentally deteriorated ruin of a cop, who spends most of his time drinking, screwing taken women, hatching plots to secure a promotion at the expense of his coworkers and in general misusing his position to feed his own sickness, depression, mania and foulness.Sound unpleasant to watch? It can be. Bruce is certainly more of an antihero, or even a villain protagonist, than he is anything else, but he is not unsympathetic. McAvoy's sheer charisma helps a lot. His very presence screams a man you'd trust and want to follow, no matter how repulsively he acts, and we do get hints of the decent man laying beneath all the... well, filth.It's also a very professional movie all around. The director Jon S. Baird has a good eye for pacing, atmosphere, use of colour and camera angles. The focus is tightly kept exactly where it's supposed to be, even as Bruce's condition deteriorates further and the hallucinations become more relevant. One review compared this film to A Clockwork Orange, and it's not a bad analogy. It's not as stylish or futuristic, but the tone and the protagonists are surprisingly similar.An experience movie above all else, Filth is a fascinating glimpse into a mind corrupted, twisted and shattered by dark happenings and the cruelty of life. It's one of McAvoy's best performances to date and it's a crime he wasn't at least nominated for an Academy Award for this. Give it a watch if you can stomach it's bile.",Filth
30,billcr12,McAvoy is Great,7,25 January 2014,"James McAvoy give an Oscar worthy performance as a coke and hooker addicted detective seeking a promotion by sabotaging his fellow cops while acting completely insane along the way. Filth begins as a black comedy, but as it unfolds, the film takes a serious turn as we realize that McAvoy is a tragically troubled and flawed individual. As an American, the Scottish accent can be difficult to understand at times, but I was able to figure out most of the dialogue. The supporting cast is excellent, but McAvoy owns this movie. He masturbates, takes massive amounts of drugs and alcohol, and has several sexual encounters on his road to hell. The last ten minutes will rip your heart out as the conclusion reflects upon the choices that we make in our lives, and how they are affected by the people we meet.",Filth
31,BeneCumb,Stylish sophistication with strong cast,8,24 February 2014,"In Great Britain, dozens of films have been made where people do or fail to do something due to use/abuse of drugs, but they are usually idle teens or adult crooks aiming to become rich and/or famous. Here, in Filth, the main characters are policemen, supplementing the story with different approaches and food for thought. The basis is solid (Filth by Irvine Welsh), enabling to create an atmosphere where real events and imaginations intertwine and the line between a law enforcer and a criminal is thin or even non-existent... Despite recurrent gloominess, there are multiple scenes where one can giggle. The ""usual"" ending and ""actual"" ending are in contradiction... So British! Practically all characters are colourful and distinct, and performed by fine actors, particularly James McAvoy as Bruce Robertson, Eddie Marsan as Clifford Blades, Jim Broadbent as Dr Rossi (female performances were less inviting).All in all, well done, but definitely not for everyone.

32,runamokprods,"Uneven, but compulsively watchable.",7,26 November 2014,"While it can't compete with ""Trainspotting"" for the best adaptation of an Irvine Welch novel (and loses some points for feeling stylistically imitative of Boyle amazing film at times), it's still an enjoyable super-high energy romp through the muck of one cop's sick and twisted mind. That messed up cop is played with verve and abandon by James McAvoy. McAvoy is joining actors of his generation like Christian Bale and Ryan Gosling who have the uncanny ability to disappear into wildly different characters seamlessly, and without a lot of 'look at this character I created' theatrics. The supporting cast is this blacker than black comedy of no manners is also terrific, with Eddie Marsan as McAvoy's hapless and meek one real friend standing out in a cast full of stand outs. Jon Baird directs with so much manic energy the film keeps threatening to derail (and not every scene works, some hitting the metaphors and symbols way too on the nose). But Baird just manages to keep it together enough so that the wretched excess in this story of a detective who will stomp on everyone around himself in hopes of getting a promotion works as a sort of Brecht on acid character study, and not a student film gone wrong (though it gets close at moments). Not the sort of film to see if you're feeling cranky and critical, but if you want to watch a young(ish) director and some excellent actors push the limits as they look inside the heart of darkness until you don't know whether to laugh or turn away, you could do a lot worse than ""Filth"".",Filth
33,jimbo-53-186511,"Stumbles and falters at the beginning, but it actually ends up being a fairly good character study",5,2 October 2014,"Bruce Robertson (James McAvoy)is a corrupt police officer that isn't bothered how he gets results - whether they are obtained ethically or not. When a Japanese student is murdered in the local area, Robertson sees this case as an opportunity to gain that much needed promotion. His confidence is given a bit of a boost when his commanding officer Superintendent Toal (John Sessions) asks him to oversee the case and informs Robertson that if he gets the necessary results that it will put him in good stead with the promotion board. Naturally, Robertson relishes this opportunity and does his best to put himself in a good light - albeit in an unethical and underhand way.What I didn't like about this film is that in its first half it seemed to do everything to excess and without much purpose; Robertson is a thoroughly unlikeable individual and his sheer vileness may be enough to force some viewers to stop watching this film. What saves the film somewhat is that we do learn more about Robertson as the film goes on, but it's a long and sleazy journey - I've got nothing against excessive violence and sleaziness up to a point, but for me it was just repetitive and overdone and quite frankly boring. However, the setup is clever whereby Robertson deliberately stirs up trouble and tries to expose their weaknesses. He's successful to an extent, but we soon learn that Robertson is more flawed than all of his colleagues put together.Then we come to the good bit, the character studying. Thank god that's the road that the writers went down. This is easily where the film is at its strongest. Robertson is a troubled man who is clearly massively insecure which explains why he bullies his best friend Bladesley (Eddie Marsan). Bullies are insecure people who bully those that are weaker than themselves in order to make them feel better about themselves. Robertson basically admits this towards the end and admits that he thinks a lot of Bladesey but can't help but bully him. The further insecurities are evident in scenes such as The Penis Enlargement Scene with the photocopier or the numerous times that Robertson will sit there masturbating which I felt highlighted his lonely existence. There are other examples of insecurities in that Robertson clearly doesn't like anyone getting along with anyone else - the scene where Lennox is getting close to the secretary and Robertson announces an impromptu penis measuring contest - this is clearly intended to embarrass Lennox as he knows that Lennox isn't 'well endowed'. Of course, by the end of this scene Robertson feels a little bit embarrassed, but only after he's 'got what he wanted'.Robertson is a thoroughly horrible individual, but there is one person he meets that manages to bring out the 'real' him and that person is Mary (Joanne Froggatt). When Robertson tries to save her husband and fails, he feels a sort of connection with Mary. I feel that the deeper sub text surrounding himself and Mary is that he feels that both her and her son fill the hole in his empty existence and that perhaps explains why he's awkward around her.When watching this film you also get a feeling that sometimes you're watching the film from Robertson's perspective and sometimes you're seeing things as a real world perspective. The big plot twist where it's revealed that Robertson witnessed the murder himself whilst dressed in his late wife's clothes was quite surprising and again highlighted Robertson's inability to be able to let go of the past. It gave me a lot to think about and it's just a shame that the first half of the film was so poor.Acting wise, McAvoy did a fairly good job and was actually fairly convincing. However, Eddie Marsan and Jim Broadbent probably gave the best performances and did help to increase the credibility of this film.FINAL SUMMARY; Pretty good when it becomes a character study, but the first half of the film is tiresome, excessive and over the top. Personally, I would have preferred it if it focused more on character studying rather than the point scoring aspect that we see at the start of the film.",Filth
34,NateWatchesCoolMovies,"Incendiary, chilling, hilarious, daring, staggering.",10,21 November 2015,"Filth is a film that relentlessly pummels you emotionally, psychologically and visually for almost two hours straight, both whilst bludgeoning your funny bone until your sides split, and sneaking up on you with a really tragic aspect that you never saw coming. It's based on a novel claimed to be unfilmable (heard that one before lol) by Irvine Welsh, who also wrote the book that became Trainspotting. It concerns Scottish detective Bruce Robertson (James Macavoy in a towering portrait of disturbing mental decay) who has seriously, irreparably lost his way. He's the smartest piggy in his department, striving for an unattainable promotion that in his mind will gain him back his estranged wife, who shows up in strange sequences that make more sense as the narrative vomits forth. He's a total raging mess though, a philandering alcoholic double crossing lunatic who shags anything with a pulse and consumes enough cocaine to make the Wolf Of Wall Street look like Sesame Street. He's seriously in distress, for reasons that ever so slowly become clear, hazed over by a feverish, stylistic excess that showcases some truly compelling filmmaking that calls to mind the works of people like Wayne Kramer or Tony Scott. Piled upon his rampant substance and sex abuse, or perhaps lurking just beneath it, is a festering mental illness, spurred on by avoidance of taking his meds, supplied by precinct shrink Jim Broadbent, extremely unsettling in surreal, hallucinatory scenes apparently taking place in Bruce's own over cooked psyche. He's involved with the spouses of several of his co workers, including shrill voiced nympho Bunty (Shirley Henderson, Moaning Myrtle from Harry Potter), wife of an oh so naive colleague of his, played by incomparable Eddie Marsan. Members of his squad range from dimwitted (Gary Lewis), to revolted and sympathetic (Imogen Poots, excellent) to just plain befuddled (John Sessions). Macavoy pulls the whole film together like a coked up mother hen leading along a demented circus of inimitable style and cinematic excess. Buried beneath his ego tripping rampage of injustice and nihilism is a bone deep sorrow that's only subtly hinted at, making it all the more poignant, for both his character and the movie.

I'm not a big fan of these sorts of examinations--I don't feel like I really much satisfaction out of them for some reason. I did enjoy the dialog, as I do with every Irvine Welsh book. And James MacAvoy was off the charts with his performance. So, plenty to enjoy about it, but somehow still left me uninterested in watching it back a second time.Edit: after watching this movie back again a week later, I've already changed my mind. Although I didn't enjoy the bleak ending or the twist involving robertson's split personalities, most of the movie is highly enjoyable. The surreal and silly scenes in the doctors office were the one thing I really wish weren't left in the film. But McAvoy is so watchable, I think I could turn this movie on at nearly any point and be hooked into watching the rest.

Describing the movie Filth is akin to explaining why drug induced mental illness is, often, absurdly funny.If any of the above makes you uncomfortable then stay away from this movie as it will only offend. For those who remain, James McAvoy's depiction of a guilt-ridden, addiction-addled, morally reprehensible police detective seeking a promotion at any cost is quite humorous. Weaving deadpan, and surreal segments which lead back to the beginning of the film, the viewer is taken on a journey of Detective Bruce Robertson's self-destruction. All of Robertson's bad behavior is amplified 10X and in that lies the humor.Filth isn't for everyone sure enough. It is however a creative parody of the downward spiral of a man losing his humanity.

39,brando647,"FILTH is Insane Fun, James McAvoy is Awesome!",8,23 January 2015,"There were two movies I saw in close succession of each other in which amiable actors got to get their hands dirty in some less polished roles. The first, DOM HEMINGWAY featuring Jude Law as a narcissistic safe cracker, was a major point of frustration for me with an uneven tone that kept bucking my interest. The second, FILTH with James McAvoy as a corrupt Scottish policeman, is significantly more fun. This should come as no surprise, as it's based on a novel from the man who wrote TRAINSPOTTING. Where that novel/film examined drug culture and the tortured lives of a few heroin junkies, FILTH is more about mental illness and one man's struggle with his own evil nature. Detective Bruce Robertson (McAvoy) is a fan of cocaine, booze, and beautiful women. He has the most fun when sabotaging the lives of his fellow police officers for his own personal relish. When he comes under consideration for a promotion, Robertson will stop at nothing to ensure he is chosen over his colleagues. The murder of a local Japanese student gives him the prime opportunity to flaunt his skills while manipulating those around him into failure. But, as the case goes on, Robertson begins to lose his grip on reality. We learn that there's more behind his sociopathic behavior than the desire for some not-so-harmless fun as he's wracked with hallucinations and the true nature of his problems surface. FILTH is James McAvoy as you've never seen him in a role that couldn't be any more a polar opposite from the X- Men series' Charles Xavier.I love a great flawed character and few have had the problems of Detective Bruce Robertson. I wouldn't necessarily qualify him as an antihero, as his intentions throughout the film are anything but heroic in any sense. Robertson is more chaos incarnate, pursuing his own selfish needs at the expense at others. We see glimmers of a humanity inside him at points in the film when he attempts to save a man's life on the street and begins forming a connection with the man's surviving wife, or when Bruce sinks into a miserable depression at the thought of his own estranged wife and child. The moments never last long before Bruce's illness takes over and he redirects his energies into his next lewd scheme. As the story progresses and Bruce fails to take his medication, his problem worsens until we get what's probably the most fun element of his illness: the visual hallucinations. It begins with a few jump scare moments where his colleagues will suddenly transform into hideous animal visages and soon he's having full-blown meltdowns where he's imagining himself with a warped vision of his psychiatrist, Dr. Rossi (Jim Broadbent, hilarious in the role). It's not surprise this craziness comes from the mind of Irvine Welsh: imagine the weirdness of the filthy toilet or detox scenes in TRAINSPOTTING expanded to infect an entire 100 minute filmthat's FILTH in a nutshell.This is James McAvoy's movie all the way. He's a blast to watch because I've never seen him do anything really unconventional before. I'm familiar with McAvoy as a wuss-turned-assassin (WANTED) or the younger iteration of Professor Charles Xavier in the new era of X-MEN films. So to see McAvoy let loose and go full sociopath is pretty awesome, especially since he pulls it off so well. He's got the range to go full nuts while breaking through with the occasional tender moment where we get a glimpse at the normal man Bruce might've once been. On the strength of McAvoy's performance alone, this movie is worth watching. Broadbent is, as I mentioned, another highlight as Rossi. He's not a major character but he's the personification of Bruce's unstable mind. Those sequences have a CLOCKWORK ORANGE feel to them with Rossi ending every sentence with ""Yeeeeeees?"" as he mocks Bruce and preaches on about tapeworms (I don't quite understand the importance of the tapeworms but apparently it's got some significance in the actual novel). The rest of the cast gets a boost from Imogen Poots (as the one seemingly level-headed person on the police force) and Eddie Marsan (as Bruce's closest approximation to a friend and the constant victim of his abuse), and many others. The writing is sharp and the humor never fails to land, and it all builds to a final act where the laughs peter out as Bruce reaches the end of his tether and it all falls apart. It's just a really well-done movie with a talented cast and crew that, being a low-budget film from the other side of the Atlantic, sadly won't get as much attention as it should here in the States.",Filth
40,Sergeant_Tibbs,"Take notes for the Trainspotting sequel, Danny Boyle.",7,8 February 2014,"It's been nearly 20 years since Danny Boyle's adaptation of Irvine Welsh's Trainspotting and no British film has been quite so instantly iconic with its vibrant and shattering representation of a sub-culture in Great Britain. However, the next major attempt at another adaptation of Welsh's gritty work, Filth, comes close. It matches the neon glaze in the grimy cinematography that's been a dynamic element missing from British cinema since, and paired with the tight edit it's an utter delight to watch. If a guilty delight that is, as almost all our characters are corrupt souls, some more than others. The first half hour is by far its strongest aspect with its hyperbolic yet not over-the-top (yet) delivery on camera, behind camera and in the post-production suite. It's a film that really accomplishes the atmosphere it's shooting for especially when combined with its disturbingly jovial Christmas soundtrack.However, when the content gets messy, the film does too. Frankly, it's too bloated with characters. I'm sure every one gets their time in the book and they all play a part in the story, but there's far too many. It results in a film that struggles with pacing and flow, constantly being interrupted with a tangent or a strange execution of exposition. It wants to raise question marks but instead it loses me. Even though I love its final moments, I'm not a fan of its twist which I don't think fit the rest of the film. It feels like a transparent attempt to shock me, or at the very most, provide some material for film theory textbooks. Despite this, it all hinges on James McAvoy's devoted and depraved performance, who nails the emotion as hard as the comedy. Filth is the film that McAvoy and Boyle's Trance wanted to be and hopefully he's watching so when he reunites the Trainspotting gang to do Porno, they do it right.7/10",Filth
41,intelearts,564th Review: Fear and Lothian On Animal Farm,8,18 May 2014,"Filth is Trainspotting for the new Millennium - a deranged, wild ride filled with a sense of the surreal, of comedy, and an incredible sense of verve. I wouldn't call it shocking per se - but it goes to its darkness with a superb comic seriousness in a way that American movies never seem to.McAvoy gives a performance that shines as a the Detective Sargeant plotting promotion and justifying his beyond outrageous bipolar behaviour in every way possible. What lifts the film is not only superb use of camera and a great script, it's its moral ambivalence - this is not simply a film of shock and awe - in it there are real questions about morality and sanity that are superb.All in all if this is a film that deserves a wider audience than most - it is full-on but really it is not simply a voyeuristic excuse to shock - it has a lot to say about the meaning of work, and even life and it does so in an exceptionally original way.",Filth
42,brchthethird,James McAvoy dominates the screen in this incredible depiction of madness and excess,8,14 November 2014,"Despite some inconsistent tone, FILTH is a darkly comic film about a despicable cop's descent into madness. The story follows Bruce Robertson, a Scottish cop who is up for a promotion, and in charge of a murder investigation. However, those two details are merely springboards for what the movie is really about, that is, his impossibly filthy lifestyle and how he pushes himself to his breaking point. As played by James McAvoy, he is largely unsympathetic although he does have a twisted sense of humor. Other than possibly feeling sorry for him (which is a stretch), the only thing audiences will have to connect with is the promise of being reunited with family, which is what he hopes to achieve with the promotion. However, in the end, even that proves illusory. There is a seriously dark undercurrent to this whole movie, but there is a lot of dark humor to soften what otherwise would be an oppressively dark portrait of a man on the edge. Even still, these are the kind of movies that I love. It's not perfect, due to some jarring attempts at sentimentality, but this is largely a bravura effort with an incredible performance by James McAvoy, and based on a book by the author of TRAINSPOTTING (which tackles similar thematic material). Despite not being for everybody, this is a well-made film that is captivating and deserves to be seen by anybody willing to give it a chance.",Filth
43,educallejero,Scarface wanna be... and I don't even like Scarface!,2,3 September 2019,"I'm not prude (I love the Jigsaw saga, I really liked Spit over your grave and a lot of tasteless movies), so it's not the ""lack of morality"" of the movie. Not even close.
Like always with me its ""the point"". I often, there might be exceptions, dislike ""pointless"" movies, which is pretty much the definition of this ""story"".
We have really just one character (the always really good at least James McAvoy), a really not likeable one. And that's it. We get to see him operate without moral boundaries of any kind. Fine. The excess in Wolf of Walt Street was fun. Here, less so. And even if there are slight nuances in his ""arc"", the truth is that the majority of the movie is offensive stuff onscreen, between a handful of really poignant ones. Not enough to deserve a whole movie. Just not enough.James McAvoy is really good but there is not enough serious material for him to work with (in the end, this is a comedy, even if a dark one), and all the serious themes you could possibly force into this movie (insecurities in a somekind powerful man really hurt by a tragedy), are thrown away but the inmense amount of not good jokes and ""funny situations"" that aren't funny.

44,aciessi,Feeling Dirty?,8,12 June 2015,"Irvine Welsh is the Elmore Leonard of Scotland, and his brilliant works have once again shined brightly on the silver screen. Filth isn't as genus, poignant and well made as Trainspotting.. not by a long shot. But this is a great movie. So, bloody, entertaining. It's a go-for-broke assault on good taste. James McAvoy is hilarious and incredibly captivating as Bruce. He can play a horny slime-ball with a wicked wit, and then turn into the most sniveling, pathetic little piggy you've ever seen. I say ""piggy"", not that I have anything against cops, but that this film literally turns him into a pig. That and several other barnyard animals, we see. If you thought the dream sequence in Trainspotting was disturbing, try an hour and a half of it. I was amazed at how it balanced broad comedy with fascinating psycho-drama. It pulls the rug out from underneath you, and places it back again.. lets say on top of you by the end of the film. Filth is uncompromising trash cinema, but it's a must see.",Filth
45,adamscastlevania2,Bad lieutenant Scotland style,7,28 August 2014,"(68%) A tale of a man who propels himself down a sewer, and along a proportion of the way down he actually enjoys the ride. It's easy to compare this to ""Bad lieutenant"", but really this is a lot more surreal, and if anything even more sleazy and corrupt. McAvoy is fantastic playing the massive dirt-ball at the heart of the production, and the film is a well put together shot in the arm with something nasty type of affair with plenty of screwing, drugs, and near constant swearing. And even though on paper there are more than a few very suspect things going on, the movie itself is not really that offensive because the more surreal and comedic elements do add a degree of lightness to the pitch-black darkness which connects all the different elements of the film together. The fact that the main character does exactly what he wants, when he wants, does give a sense that anything can and will happen, but it also makes the plot more than a little haphazard at times as it stumbles about like old Bruce himself. Although overall this comes recommended for those who like black-comedy from the seedy side of town, as this is, despite a few flaws, some real entertaining filth, with a great central performance that's worthy of a look for that reason alone.",Filth
46,carbuff,You can't stop yourself from looking at a horrific car crash.,9,10 May 2015,"A very good black comedy, with the emphasis on black. This film is twisted and disturbing and only gets more and more so as it goes along. The lead character starts off as totally despicable, but nearer the end becomes more sympathetic--that's as far as I want to go so that I don't spoil anything. Watching this movie is like looking at a horrific auto accident, you might keep looking at it, but it makes you more and more uncomfortable the longer you do. This movie depicts some really ugly behavior and some twisted visions, but it is compelling to watch. If you choose to view this, I would advise you not to do so right before going to bed, since it just doesn't lend itself to a restful mind afterward. It's so close to a possible reality that I think that it is much more horrifying than most horror movies. I can't think of many people I know who would want to watch this movie, even though personally I found it interesting. Forewarned is forearmed.",Filth
47,bjarias,..you lookin for any 'happy'.. this ain't it !,7,6 May 2014,".. but this film keeps your attention from start to finish... and it's all James McAvoy. Undoubtedly one of his finest works. Not being the kind of film that attracts award attention, but he really deserves a nod for what is one of the finest acting performances of the year. Those watching for the lovely Imogen Poots will have to wait for another project. She's on screen overall for such a brief period, and really does not enter much into the storyline to have any great impact... same for most all other cast members. So if you like McAvoy, this is your show. Just don't expect to see him be smilin very much (if at all).

48,joebloggscity,Irvine Welsh's dark Edinburgh fantasy,5,17 September 2016,"I already read the book of this film when it first came out many years back, but only got round to the film adaption lately.For any unacquainted with author Irvine Welsh's work then he is a man with a dark imagination that seems to merge dark humour, biting satire and grim reality all together without signposting it all. He can twist as well as the best of the thriller writers and outgun any comedian.In this story, we centre round the misdeeds of a immoral policeman whose life has entered a downward spiral, and there's more to meet the eye. Practically everyone in the film is a miscreant, with the few exceptions, and we are on a journey through the lewd side of Edinburgh which isn't advertised on the biscuit tins.Anyhow, the jokes are nasty, the humour unforgiving and the characters unsympathetic.You'll either love it or be bored. Some have found this really funny, I just didn't take to it. James McAvoy in the lead is excellent as always, but it doesn't work for me.It's a fine film, but I couldn't enjoy it and I'm no prude.

I suppose the film qualifies as willfully politically incorrect, but in such exaggerated ways I *think* it's easy enough to look past the broad and bent humor.Harder to look past Broadbent himself though, yeeeessssss?That said, I rented this shortly after seeing Joaquin Phoenix's ""Joker"" and ""Filth"" is five times the film. Both have reprehensible characters embracing their spiral into villainy, James McAvoy as Detective Roberson embraces his decline with passion rather than with bumbling reluctance.Additionally, ""Filth"" eschews interchangeable powerless psych/med/social workers for a crazier-than-thou scene-stealing Jim Broadbent. He worms his way into your mind in small but potent doses.In both films, the plot per se is not much to behold, but McAvoy's performance dances circles around the slow-motion jazzercise of The Joker in my opinion.For a film brimming with and indeed titled as ""Filth"" there is a bit of tidiness with how the story is delivered. Maybe more of a 7 but in vivid contrast to the praise for the blase ""Joker"" it gets a crazy eight.",Filth

55,TheSquiss,Joyful depravity. Enough said!,10,25 September 2013,"Mister Tumnus, I've a feeling we're not in Narnia any more Think you know James McAvoy? Think again. His performance in Jon S. Baird's adaptation of Irving Welsh's Filth is astounding and there is nothing sweet or fluffy about it or any other aspect of the film. Filth is very funny, very wrong, very sordid and very likely to incite hatred from Daily Mail readers across the land. Sex, drugs, more sex, more drugs, violence, corruption, depravity, even more sex and drugs Filth is absolutely, well, filthy, and is a memorable experience to say the least.My companion for the screening, Bag, made two comments that stood out post-screening. The first I agree with entirely: ""With the thousands of films I've seen over the years, this is the first one I've come out of wishing that I'd made it."" The second, that it was a film to appreciate rather than enjoy, I'm going dispute. Call me debauched, immoral and twisted, but I enjoyed every last nanosecond of Filth.But that's not to say it is always easy viewing. Far from it. Sometime after the midway point the laughs die down, the stomach churns a little more uneasily, the grimaces are more evident and the intakes of breath are more audible. We are less willing to forgive but, like the car crash up ahead that has caused all the drivers in front to rubber-neck, well, just one long look as we pass can't hurt, can it? Bruce Robertson (McAvoy) is a bigot. He's bi-polar, a junkie, sex-obsessed, self-obsessed, manipulative and frequently thoroughly unpleasant. He's also a cop. With a promotion in the balance, Bruce is up against several colleagues and sets about turning one against the other, unsettling them with salacious gossip and blatant lies to ensure he beats them to the post. Throw in his manipulation of fellow freemason Bladesey (Eddie Marsan), his sultry wife, Carole (Shauna MacDonald) and his hallucinatory sessions with Doctor Rossi (Jim Broadbent) and you have one monumentally screwed up anti-hero. And what's not to love about that? The Cohen brothers may have the monopoly on fantastic character names, but nobody writes actual characters like Welsh and the cast that Baird has poured into Filth is staggeringly good in their interpretation of this mess of freaks and misfits. There isn't a poor performance in the entire film from the uncertain laddishness of Ray (Jamie Bell) to the fantastic absurdity of Doctor Rossi. While none are bona fide Hollywood stars, the cast that glitters in a maniacal, dirty way is a treat beyond expectation: Imogen Poots, Shirley Henderson, Gary Lewis (yes, Billy Elliott and his dad are reunited at last!), John Sessions, Joanne Froggatt Filth is a perfectly paced film; it roars ahead stirring emotions and judgment, exciting and thrilling as it trashes everything in its wake but it is never so fast that we feel left behind or that we've missed out on a juicy morsel of degeneracy. Sufficient time is allowed for us to filter through, as best we can, the quagmire that is Bruce's life, but Baird never pauses or permits us time to glance at our watch or neighbour.The soundtrack, too, is bang on the money stamping though a musical landscape that is at times acceptably cheesy and more often a reminder of what to check is on the iPod. Where else can you effortlessly segue from David Soul into Shaking' Stevens? While the latter is consigned to audio wallpaper, the bizarrely fantastic cameo from David Soul is a delight. Had Dennis Potter snorted cocaine Pennies From Heaven might have resembled this.Yes, there are elements of Welsh's novel that are missing (no police dogs here) from Filth but there always have to be excisions for film adaptations and there's no reason, in this instance at least, to mark down a film for that. No, Filth is superb and as near to perfect as I've seen for many months (since Broken and Trance).If the trailer excited you, take the plunge. If you're a nun, a granny, my mother, or lack a strong stomach and nurture your prudishness, take a very long, very fast walk in the direction of something much safer. Dixon of Dock Green this ain't! If you look in the mirror and see something slightly off-kilter grinning back, however For more reviews from The Squiss, subscribe to my blog and like the Facebook page.",Filth
56,osj2507,Heavily medicated or maybe more drug addicted,7,15 March 2015,"In this film James McAvoy takes the lead as a heavily medicated or more drug addicted police detective, the book is written by Welsh and that should have set me off to what kind of film it could be, since Trainspotting I don't think there have been a well directed adaption of any of his material. Jon S. Baird does a good job, it is as straight forward, direct, weird, unrelenting and strange as I vividly remember Trainspotting to be, but I think maybe this 90th kind of acid tripping film is not working out to well for me.The film is weird but entertaining, it is well played, but the roles gritty and dirty, it all plays very well together actually, so it is hard not to like even the weirdest parts.

58,rooee,Grubby in a good way,7,11 October 2013,"This is another film adaptation of an Irvine Welsh novel that was referred to as ""unfilmable"", although when reading the book when it first came out I for one was struck by the tightness of the narrative and the cinema-friendly focus on a single protagonist.The antihero in question is Bruce Robertson (James McAvoy), a dodgy copper trying to make the most of a promotion opportunity by ruining his rivals through a series of cruel intricate schemes. Meanwhile, his mind is deteriorating, and he's haunted by flashbacks, waking dreams, and humanoid livestock. The film is fairly faithful to the source, and the changes (including some understandably blunted edges) are down to the different artform.Irvine Welsh has said that McAvoy's performance is better than De Niro's in Taxi Driver. I don't think this is a suitable comparison. Scorsese's seminal feature was about a post-traumatic depression, whereas Jon S. Baird's film is more manic. For me, the film Filth most resembles is A Clockwork Orange. Like Kubrick's masterpiece, the entire aesthetic is informed by the subjectivity of the central character. And there are subtler nods: the use of classical music, the bleached windows, Jim Broadbent's reinvention of the Deltoid character (a probation officer then, a psychiatrist now), and the visual reference to 2001: A Space Odyssey.Before the film's release, I wasn't convinced by the casting of McAvoy, but after watching it I can safely say he's transformative – to capture such bipolar savagery and the fear in a single facial expression is the sign of a special performance. The supporting cast provides a colourful blend of caricatures. Jamie Bell, Eddie Marsan and Imogen Poots all make an impact in the few moments when McAvoy isn't dominating the screen.For me, the dud notes concern the tone of the film. Sometimes Baird's shifts between the schizoid black comedy of Robertson's outbursts and his introspective guilt about his past are so sudden and sentimental that their capacity to convince is lost in the (lack of) transition. Part of this is down to Clint Mansell's disappointingly soft score, whose tinkly piano and lifeless strings often feel incongruous, more awkward than deliberate.But these minor issues don't detract from a powerful, funny, and finally moving depiction of mental disintegration. To say that it's the best Welsh adaptation since Trainspotting may not be saying much – so I'll say instead that it's a very good film in its own right.",Filth

60,in1984,The Wolf of Scotland Yard,6,14 February 2014,"6.25 of 10. A complicated, adult film, but not because of the sex, drugs, and electronica. It's a film that requires viewing as a whole and a well developed brain to put it all in context. If either of those are missing, you should opt for a simpler film.Unlike The Wolf of Wall Street, there's both nothing financial going on and it needs to be longer. A complicated psycho tale shouldn't be forced into an action film schedule. This is, however, another story of competitiveness out of control. Same rules apply, but from the angle of a detective cop who is neither an American Psycho nor other type of sociopath. To say what exactly would spoil the crime mystery aspect of the story.It's possible that for this film to really work well (at least for us in the USA), it needs to be translated from Scot-English to US-English. There are a few obscure words and accent/pronunciation issues. As pure performance art, it deserves a higher rating. As is, the rules of story telling and considering your audience still apply.",Filth
61,shawneofthedead,"A merry mix of murder, mayhem and madness. McAvoy is marvellous.",9,5 March 2014,"In almost every respect, Filth is a film that shouldn't work at all. An adaptation of Irvine Welsh's complicated, difficult novel laced with shades of psychosis and depravity? In the hands of a director who has only one other film under his belt? Featuring a central character who's more monster than man, not so much demanding sympathy as being almost completely undeserving of it? Starring James McAvoy, a charming, nice- guy bloke of an actor who made his big-screen debut as a faun? No, it really shouldn't work – and yet, it does, remarkably well.Bruce Robertson (McAvoy) is a wretched beast of a man who lies, cheats, manipulates and fornicates his way through life. To snag a promotion to Detective Inspector in the Edinburgh police department, Bruce ruthlessly plays his colleagues off one another. But it soon becomes clear that his latest case – the gang murder of a Japanese student – is not the only thing unravelling around him. Bruce's wife and child have left him, and it seems likely that his wits will soon follow suit.By rights, there's nothing particularly funny about Bruce's predicament. Filth could easily have been presented as a bleak, cautionary drama about mental illness and sociopathy, asking questions about when a personality defect tips over into madness. It would be far more difficult to give full play to the blackest of black humour that suffuses Welsh's novel.And yet, writer-director Jon S. Baird's decision to do just that is precisely why Filth works as well as it does. It's not an easy or comfortable watch, and could prove utterly repulsive to some. But there's something magnetically enchanting about the film as it zips by. In effect, it's a live-action cartoon on steroids, chasing after Bruce as he bounces from reality into his drug-addled imagination and back again. Miraculously, Baird ensures that Filth never veers into the realm of camp. Instead, the entire experience is a perverse mix of charm and horror: you'll find yourself almost ashamed to take delight in a film and character so unapologetically depraved.The sheer electric power of McAvoy's performance cannot be over-stated. Everything in the film sets Bruce up as that rare villain who becomes a leading man: he preys mercilessly on those more innocent than himself (including Jamie Bell's awkward young detective and Eddie Marsan as Bruce's hapless, self-termed best friend), and disdains those more competent or trying to help him (his main rival as played by Imogen Poots). McAvoy commits utterly fearlessly to Bruce's villainy. It's a revelation to see an actor known for his genial, everyman demeanour descend into such dark and sordid places.But the true magic of McAvoy's performance comes in the quieter moments, the handful of shuddering silences that pepper Bruce's outbursts of action and manipulation. Therein, McAvoy unearths a fast-fading glimmer of humanity – not in any way enough to redeem Bruce, but essential to forming a more complete, tragic picture of the man who has lost himself beneath layers of monster and menace.As a film, Filth asks a lot of its audience: trust in the crazy twists in its story, forbearance for its more morally repugnant characters and moments, faith in its ability to tie all the loose ends up in a way that doesn't cheapen itself. Not everyone will think Baird has succeeded. Those who haven't walked out by the end might be upset by the cheeky audacity of its final scene. But those who give themselves over to the streak of insanity – both literal and metaphorical – laced throughout Filth will be rewarded with one of the smartest, darkest and most intellectually beguiling films of the year.",Filth

63,gavinp9,"OK Scottish crime 'dramedy' - if you like 'Trainspotting', you'll like 'Filth', but Guy Ritchie's British crime films are much more enjoyable in my opinion.",6,2 January 2018,"'Filth' is Irvine Welsh's second novel turned into a film, after 'Trainspotting'. I actually wasn't aware of this when I watched the film, but it was very obvious throughout and is quite similar in many regards - not least because it's set in Scotland and the main character is a junkie who keeps making bad decisions.It's billed as a ""comedy"" - and it has moments that are funny - but it's definitely not comedic. McAvoy plays Inspector Bruce Robertson, who is climbing the ladder of cocaine addiction (as depicted by the film's poster) to try and get a promotion. It's just that it turns out a lot of his ""games"" and ambitions are delusions and hallucinations. This makes some of the film a little like trying to solve a puzzle, although it's clear that his family are not actually there from the start. While there's still a few ""what the?!"" moments, you do have a bit of empathy for McAvoy, even though he treats his one friend, Bladesey (Marsan), terribly. The soundtrack throughout is excellent, even the cover of Radiohead's 'Creep', which is hard to pull off. The ""mystery"" is solved near the end and the final scene is fitting - hopeful and heartbreaking, all at once.",Filth
64,Alanjackd,Love Really Hurts,7,15 June 2015,What a little cracker . Marvellous. A brilliant social study movie full of metaphors .James M is really biting at this part and the rest of the cast are immense. Seems to be a sprint of a movie...321..go...and keeps up the speed and tempo till the very last second. I was left feeling both disgust and sympathy for the lead and tried to put myself in his position...we have all been there! Makes you think what really happens in police stations...we are all only human.Made me feel like we are all craving for a bit of sanity in a world gone mad.This could only have been made in Scotland and gave us a glimpse of how our own demons can follow us and dictate our every waking moment. Having said all that it is hilarious and made me watch it again straight after. Pure unadulterated joy.,Filth
65,mcjensen-05924,Steaming Heap Of Dung,1,10 August 2021,"I didn't like film because of all the sex and drug use and violence. That sort of thing has it's place in movies and when it's well done, and not overdone, it adds to the success of a film. That's not the case here at all. The sex scenes were just out of place, overdone, and didn't add a thing to the plot. They were trying to be edgy or perverse or something but it was just plain dumb. You will get sick to death of the lead actor doing drugs. We get it! You're a junkie who screws your friends over. A selfish loser who then has the audacity to preach to his friend about how to be successful. Gimme a break! We start with a murder, and the whole police force spends the entire movie not investigating it. Not until the end when we need a tidy conclusion do they seem to remember to tie up that loose end. Incredibly dense....... Joanne Froffatt and Imogen Poots are the only cast members who shine, but Joanne's character is particularly not credible. She's interested in James's character because he tried to save her husband's life, but the way he was giving CPR on the street so violently was probably what killed him. Geez man how about some attention at least to the big details. Imogen was lovely, believable and genuine, and that cannot be said of any other cast member in this farce. McAvoy's character is just someone you instantly despised and wanted horrible things to happen to. No funny moments or clever lines such as you'd find in Trainspotting, which a lot of other reviewers seem compelled to compare this to. For me it just rang phony and stupid all the way through. It's not easy to make Shirley Henerson look inept, but they managed to do it here. No, this movie isn't worth a watch and the fact I've spent this much time giving a review nobody will read is bugging me. But it was just so horrendously silly and awful and pointless with no payoff at the ending that I was mad enough to give my views here. Want clever and original? Try Snatch, Lock Stock And Two Smoking Barrels & Trainspotting. Hell, ever T2 was miles better than this. Transparent film making tricks and lazy tools to advance the plot were a cop out and proof that nobody was really giving their top effort here. Eddie Marsan also stood out as a shining talent amongst a bunch of rank foolish imbecilic amateurs.",Filth
66,Jerghal,Not even close to the trailer,7,26 January 2014,"The trailer looked like this was going to be an incredible fun ride much like snatch, trainspotting or smoking aces was...but Filth fails to deliver. McAvoy play a junkie cop who plays sick games with his colleagues in an attempt to secure a promotion and win his wife back. The dialogue is fast, full of slang and sometimes difficult to understand. Most scenes are chaotic and fast paced with all sorts of crooked camera angles. The film comes of as being a bit messy and aimless. That being said I have to say that I like films in this genre quite a lot but they are very though to get right. I appreciate Jon S. Baird's effort here but the film could have used some more polishing and a better plot. But I will sure keep an eye out for his future productions.",Filth
67,martinrobertson300482,Like nothing you've ever seen before ...,7,25 October 2013,"Warning – Minor spoilers ahead! Destined to be a ""cult"" film, and currently the ""adult"" movie everyone is talking about. ""Filth"" is a big deal in that its apparently the only decent adaption of an Irvin Welsh book apart from ""Train spotting."" Making it huge in Scotland! (Where I am) I Got what I wanted, or at least expected from it. Its in your face, and I loved some of its twisted weirdness, James MacAvoys loud performance, and its dirty, dry jokes. It is actually a great movie, in how its really like nothing you've ever seen before, and is truly memorable in a way that a lot of other same old, same old stuff out there is not.You may find it goes a bit over board however. Some of its shocking moments are maybe a bit too shocking, and (I'll attempt to be spoiler free here) I wasn't a fan of the ""twist"" ending. Now that I've said there is a twist you'll probably see it coming. I'm sure a lot of people had their minds blown by it, but its the style of ending I always find a bit dumb in any movie. Not just this one.",Filth
68,mistoppi,Horrible but freaking hilarious,9,4 March 2017,"It's been over a year since I saw this film, probably even longer than I think. It is one of my favourite movies and I chose to do a 21 page analysis on it for school while we could've settled for 5-10 pages. But once you watch a movie as often as I used to watch Filth, you want to take a break. And it's good to take that break, because after a while you can appreciate the little things in the film. Like this time watching this movie I was astonished by the cinematography, especially the lighting and the colours, as if I hadn't paid attention during the first time. I had, but for some reason it all felt very new to me. It's probably the amount of movies I've watched between this and the last time I watched Filth.There are many differences between the novel and the movie. Some of them are good, because you couldn't fit all that in the movie, and Irvine Welsh always takes his time before the actual twists come into the story. It's obvious Jon S. Baird had to tighten up Welsh's novel quite a bit considering Welsh's style and how many details he fits into a story. But if there's one thing that really bothers me, it's that the murdered Japanese man in the beginning was a black man in the book. It seems like a minor change but it isn't, and it will always, always bug me.Of course there's obvious difference between any book and the movie - a movie gives a face to a character. And in the novel Bruce Robertson is awful, and it's hard to feel bad for him in any way, but when he's given James McAvoy's face and talent, it's harder to not feel bad for him. You know he's horrible. There's nothing about Bruce Robertson you could actually like, but it's James McAvoy's fault some viewers might feel bad for him. That's the only reason James McAvoy shouldn't play this part. McAvoy is amazing, he's truly phenomenal as Bruce Robertson, but he's also too sympathetic.But while this film is completely awful, it's also hilarious. Just like with most of Welsh's stuff.",Filth

Filth is such a film. Yet the superb acting of James McAvoy and Co. is the sole reason I gave this film a 6.McAvoy, almost like Jack Nicholson in the Shining,wonderfully portrays a deeply disturbed cop gradually sinking deeper and deeper into manic-depression and schizophrenia. The sad part is deep down he's a decent guy who wants a normal love life...but can't have one. At first you think this is going to be a Thin Blue Line type dark comedy...yet it quickly becomes a gross out fest of Sadism, sex and vomit.In the end, however, all hope is gone with a total downer ending.

McAvoy really had to bring the nasty to turn into his Bruce Robertson, and he pulled it off nicely.Being a boring Midwesterner from ""flyoverland USA"", it necessitated I watch this with English subtitles (and boy, did I need them), as my dialect ear is more keen to understanding Green Bay Packers fans from Upper-Wisco. talk than people from inner-city Edinburgh. And I also didn't have a clue as who to just WTF this Frank Sidebottom character was they were watching on TV, so that went way over my head until I researched it later.

74,PassPopcorn,Pass the Popcorn review,8,24 January 2014,"It's been a while since I read Irvine Welsh's Filth, and I don't remember much, but what I do remember is that it was a disgusting, shocking, brilliant novel. And naturally, when I heard a movie was being made, I couldn't help but feel impatient and excited. For some strange reason, it never crossed my mind the movie might be awful, and I never saw any trailer for it. Luckily, I wasn't disappointed: the movie is very good, even though it deviates from the book sometimes – which is normal, and especially necessary in a novel like Filth. I would suggest you read the book, obviously, but for those who don't have time or just don't want to, this movie will be a good replacement.filth1Filth follows Bruce Robertson (James McAvoy) – a corrupt, sick, unhappy policeman, whose wife (Shauna Macdonald) and daughter left him, and who's working on a murder case that might get him the promotion he longs for. But instead of concentrating on the case, he decides to try and estrange and discredit all of his potential rivals, because Bruce likes to do drugs, get drunk and have sex with as many women as possible much more than he likes his job. While he seems just rude (and successful) to people, Bruce is actually going through serious addiction, depression and is suffering from hallucinations – all of the while, trying to get his family back.filth2One can't watch Filth and not think of another very good movie that came out recently – The Wolf of Wall Street. The latter, amazingly, isn't as depraved as Filth (and I bet now everyone who has seen The Wolf wants to see Filth). The Wolf is also a movie about a bad person and a lot of bad stuff happens, but Filth makes you feel disgusted where The Wolf made you laugh. It's very difficult to feel for the main character in this movie – except in those brief minutes when he shows his true feelings, and even that goes away in an instant as Bruce's nasty personality emerges once again. All of this thanks to the amazing James McAvoy, whom I've seen before in Atonement (2007, a great movie) and Trance (2013, which I didn't particularly like), and who manages to display the multitude of the main character's personalities and feelings with ease, making this a one-man show.filth3There's a lot of supporting characters in the feature, and none is bad – although some may seem unnecessary, because there simply isn't enough time to develop over fifteen characters so that each one of them turns out to be truly interesting. Surely, Eddie Marsan's role as Bladesey, Bruce's ""best friend"", sticks out: he's extremely naive and afraid of the world, and Bruce likes to exploit that – not without a bit of guilt, though, and that shows us his more human side. It should be added that the movie makes you laugh often but, as it approaches the end, the laughs thin out. Ultimately, and as you may have guessed, this movie isn't for the sensitive and easily offended ones. To the rest of you, it's a recommendation!

75,TheGreatMarkukini,An outrageous ode to a beautiful life,8,3 April 2019,"First peek at the trailer gave an impression of a concoction of the wildest acts in the name of selfishness and self-destruction performed by an outstanding James McAvoy and frankly what I've got was much fascinating and stunning.Based on the book but having only several real references to the original, the movie creates a desire to check the sources - that's how good it is! The sequence is anything but slow - ""game of thrones"" style cobwebs placed by the main character all lead to his victory. Some might think that the author wanted to prevent bad behavior of people, but I think that he was just showing the rotten kind of a human that has no limits and moves on the heads of others to satisfy the appetite.The moves on this chess board sometimes are crude and obvious but the results are cracking the solid face and you enjoy that filthy outcome. Though all the obscenity, detective Bruce Robertson shows us a little of the background that led him to this life and this story properly explains such a turn of a personality and, to be honest, gives a heart-braking shade to the character.Nevertheless, the show has tons of tricks that are waiting behind the curtain to shock you. It reminds me of a therapy with an electric current, however, here you never turn it off - you just spike the power. Incredible pick of the score plays a significant role in rising the sensation and editing with a small 4th wall break interventions engage the viewer like an actual bad-boy routine course.As soon as the curtains fall the screaming sound is still around you: the imagery and all the nasty deeds are crying out loud the reverse of what is 'acceptable' in modern world, however, you don't have that immediate urge to jump into the shower. On the contrary, the picture gives a giant chunk of granite for you to chew and understand the value of what you are having and that the past is past - but the future is still there even if present stinks as a pigsty.",Filth
76,kikkapi20,Another gem from Danny Boyle.,9,21 August 2014,"McAvoy is outstanding here. I honestly try to keep an open mind when it comes to actors but when I saw the trailers for this one I just couldn't see him as a rough cop, but when you see the film he is just perfect, in big part due to the fact that the film is not about a rough cop but about a walking mess. Loved this movie. Even the soundtrack manages to make over-used and instantly recognizable tunes feel appropriate and fresh. McAvoy has been great in everything I've seen him in (he was my absolute favorite part), and I want him to do more leading roles like this.l Also, the end credits cartoon sequence was a bit of inspired fun.",Filth
77,writenamehere,and the point was?,2,2 March 2021,"The title of this film should suggest graphic content, which it supplies almost to the exclusion of almost everything else. There are some moments you could imagine to be the basis of amusing memes, but you'd have to take them out of context, such as the exclamation by the police commissioner, ""...this isn't some corner of the country, this is Scotland for christssake!"". There are a few moments of substantial acting, by the lead, and supporting cast: one such moment between the detective and a collegue played by Imogen Poots. It would've been nice of the director and screen writer to make use of that ability, but instead we got frenetic sex and drugs. The biggest problem is that the plot can't possibly be as related in the book, because the end doesn't ring true. You couldn't write a book like this and expect it to sell. This film is just a collection of images based on the book. Not the worst available out there, but even with graphic images, it's still quite forgetable. See it out of curiosity.",Filth
78,The_moan_of_all_moans,Bonkers,8,3 October 2013,"I left the cinema speechless; i normally try to critique and discuss the film straight after, but i was speechless. It was the craziest film i have seen in a long time. It takes boundaries and tells them to f*** off. There are no restrictions with this film. There is brutality, sexism, racism, oppression, homophobia. It is polluted with prejudice. But i thought it was a great film. Am i part of those worldly problems? No. But let's face it, this is unfortunately the way the world is and all this film is doing is showing you just how filthy this world can be. James McAvoy is a revelation as Detective Bruce Robertson; i really didn't see all the fuss with him. Yes he was good in ""The Last King of Scotland"", but the rest of the films i just couldn't match the hype to the actor, then i went to see ""Trance"" and i was blown away by his performance. And if it weren't for seeing that i probably wouldn't have been half as eager to see this. Because he showed the ability to portray more than one character in a film; someone who is both fragile and unstable. With ""Filth"" he excels beyond that and gives his best showing of his young career. He conveys every emotion, from bitterness, to regret, to sadness, to rage, to insanity and he conveys them extremely convincingly. It is a masterclass of acting. Some may be easily offended, and if you are usually like that, i would avoid seeing the film. But if you want to face the World and its obvious problems head on (in the form of a film) then it is an outstanding film to do so.",Filth
79,toll-8,McAvoy steals it as a character you love to watch. A good adaptation but won't be a classic.,6,24 October 2013,"Hands up those of you who like swearing, drug abuse and obscene sexual encounters? Put your hands down if you prefer to be indulging in these pastimes instead of watching them. For those of you with your hand still raised stiffly in the air you need to watch Filth!Starring James McAvoy as Police Officer Bruce Robertson, Filth delves into the psyche of immoral behaviour in order to achieve an overall goal. Christmas is approaching and Bruce and his colleagues (Jamie Bell, Imogen Poots, Emun Elliot, Gary Lewis) are all up for the promotion to Detective Inspector. Bruce believes he is the odds on favourite to win this position but his deeper insecurities may suggest otherwise. To be able to win this Bruce attempts to manipulate his way through the team, be it sleeping with a colleague's wife and blaming it on someone else or enticing homophobic officers to show their true colours. But is this behaviour due to his passion for the big time job or is Bruce really struggling with other aspects of his life? Other aspects that fill him with guilt, self-loathing and most importantly isolation.Filth is billed as a comedy but only approach if you realise this comedy comes from crudity and vulgarity. The laughs stem from scenes where Bruce prank calls his friend's wife weekly for no other reason than for the sexual kick. He later meets her to promise he will catch the prankster only to suggest she plays along with the sexual fantasy in an attempt to scare them off. Of course we all know this is only for his own benefit but it is watching the different reaction from Bruce, his friend and the wife that raises the chuckle. The friend is played by Eddie Marsan and he alone brings the less obscene comedic moments. His dance routine whilst on a trip to Hamburg is to be admired as is his chat with Bruce about police oppression.Marsan is fantastic in his role especially in the later scenes where he becomes the character you fully sympathise with. McAvoy's Bruce is expertly played but the character is one you will not like but one you will enjoy to watch. McAvoy plays completely against type but still brings many of his usual acting qualities. One thing that was familiar was his subtle look into the camera when he knows he has been unbelievably unlawful. This little technique could also be seen in Trance although with very different subtext. What works for McAvoy is his inability to let go of the reigns and really go for it and here he has done that so well. He even manages to bring an emotional side to Bruce as the truth slowly starts to be revealed and it will make an audience question whether you should be feeling sad for this character. This is completely down to McAvoy's acting ability as we can assure you Bruce is not a likable character.The film draws comparisons to Trainspotting and that is because the script has been adapted from a novel written by the same author, Irvine Walsh. With Trainspotting Walsh's material was expertly handled by Danny Boyle and a fantastic film was born. New director Jon S. Baird can be praised as highly as Boyle for his adaptation here. He has taken on the writing mantle as well as the directing and what he has achieved is a solid film which is worth a watch. The film is nowhere near as good as Trainspotting but where Baird achieves such excellence is in bringing a book to the screen that involved imaginary tape worms and plenty of internal narrative. The book is not of a filmic mould but Baird has done incredibly well in making it so. Bruce's emotional journey is felt through his actions, dialogue and McAvoy's acting, whilst the obscure tapeworm hallucinations have been replaced with a doctor played by Jim Broadbent who seems to have an issue with saying 'yeeess' at the end of every sentence. When you leave the cinema from this film you will struggle to decide if you actually liked it. Bruce isn't likable and some of the antics may offend so we would be surprised if many people will enjoy watching. Where this triumphs then is that it is a film to be admired. It brings an unlikeable protagonist and makes him magnetising to watch whilst making you chuckle in cringe worthy moments. This is one of those films best enjoyed with a beer or two.Rating: 3 / 5Directing: Baird has made conscious decisions that have translated the book to the film very well. Acting: McAvoy's brilliant playing against type and Marsan brings a likable character to the film.Script: From tough source material, Jon S. Baird produces a screenplay which fully does it justice.Cinematography: The imagery resembles the title and brings out a shady side to Edinburgh.Score: Goes slightly unnoticed due to the nature of the content but works all the same.Editing: Moves the story along at pace. Overall: McAvoy steals it as a character you love to watch. A good adaptation but won't be a classic.",Filth
80,s_campanale,The Filth and the Fury - Inside the mind of Scotland's most troubled Detective for a trip to the dark side.,8,8 October 2013,"Irvine Welsh is the Scottish writer whose works are noted for their willingness to examine the darkest, dirtiest corners of his native Scotland, of society, and the human soul itself. His best known work is still the Heroin addiction chronicle ""Trainspotting"", which became a cult item back in 1996 and launched many film careers. Another of his most famed works was 1998's ""Filth"", which became one of those ""must film but how the Hell can you?"" projects, and now finally arrives helmed by newcomer Jon S. Baird and starring the cream of Scottish and UK talent.Playing like some Xtreme Dickens, Maupassant or Gogol story, it takes place largely inside the head of troubled Edinburgh plain clothes detective Bruce Robertson (James Macavoy), a ball of rage, anger and self-loathing who is on medication, seeing a psychiatrist (Jim Broadbent) and haunted by the accidental death of his brighter, better, cleverer and more popular younger brother when they were children, an accident he feels (perhaps correctly) he caused out of jealousy. This ingrained sense of inferiority and natural disadvantage fuels him still, making him see life itself as a constant Darwinian battle against everyone else to be ""king of the mountain."" At work he fights a planned, merciless guerrilla war against his colleagues for an all-important promotion to executive command, studying their weaknesses and playing off them, and indeed playing them off against each other while all the while presenting himself as their friends, a sort of Iago-Machiavelli combo. He even has an on-off affair with one of their wives (Kate Dickie, the Scots doctor from ""Prometheus"") while trying to win over the only female on the team, the educated ""modern copper"" Amanda Drummond (Imogen Poots) The youngest member, Ray (Jaime Bell) a drug addict in lust with the squad secretary, falls under his wing, but is more than he seems. At his Masonic lodge he torments the newbie, shy, sheepish businessman Bladsey (Eddie Marsan) simply to hone his manipulation skills, making obscene phone calls to his slutty wife Bunty (Shirley Hendrson) then blaming HIM for them and taking him on a ""lad's weekend"" to Germany where he makes him go with prostitutes and laces his drink with Ecstasy tablets. His only other goal in life apart from pushing everyone else down is to regain his estranged wife Carole (Shauna Macdonald) and his 7 yr old daughter. Her memory haunts him still, and she appears in a series of bizarre, 80's perfume ad style vignettes talking about how she too would like to get him back but only on her terms. There is also the brutal and possibly racially aggravated murder of a Japanese student that fuels the whole thing, the denouement of which takes the story on a bizarre 180 degree twist of the ""Memento""- ""Fight Club"" style, which you will never see because it comes out of nowhere. When he tries single handily to save a young accident victim, his sensitive young widow Mary (Joanne Froggat) and her adorable 7 yr old son, who idolises him as a hero and a ""good man"" triggers off in him a devastating moral crisis that sees his demons come out and his sanity unravel. Is there any hope of redemption for this fallen soul?The film, like the book, is not afraid of looking into the squalor. For most of the first half, it revels in the debauchery and vice of not only its lead character but of the less than admirable specimens of humanity that surround him, none of whom is totally clean or likable. There is dirty ugly sex, drug abuse, racist and homophobic banter aplenty, violence, beating and intimidation of suspects, and of course Robertson's one man war against humanity. It is refreshingly free of judgement, rather like 70's films like ""The French Connection"", ""Freebie and the Bean"" and ""The Choirboys"". Alas the film is not content with this and slowly but surely starts injecting an increasingly suffocating tone of moralism, including the positively Dickensian ""saintly young widow and adorable child"" motif to bring out ""the light"" in him. It is not a stretch to say it seems a pair with ""Flight"", which similarly revelled in sin only to then make it a parable of Christian redemption. Rather than be shown as an honest portrait of humanity warts and all, it tells us his aggressive ways are the result of trauma and self-loathing, that he is mentally sick (psychiatrist, pills, etc) and needs curing. Maybe I am too cynical, but being a human being is not something that needs curing medically or psychologically or redeeming!The film is well made, well-acted, and features some great tracks from the 1990s (when the book was written, even though it is visibly set in the present day) Macavoy, normally quite a grating presence given to biting his lip, squinting, shouting and going ""Ape sheet"" in lieu of real acting, here delivers a commanding performance that may herald a new maturity. There are also many surreal touches, including fantasy sequences and Robertson increasingly seeing the characters around him by their ""animal spirits"" (he himself is a pig!) which also informs the horribly ironic Loony Tunes cartoon end credits sequence.The film is going to be tough going for many ""sensitive"" viewers, and so won't be for all tastes. Also it has a very ambiguous ending which may need a dusting off of the original novel to fully understand.Probably not destined to be as iconic as ""Trainspotting"" it is nonetheless a powerful and even enjoyable addition to the British film legacy.",Filth
81,eonbluedan-1,Surprising - the best in bad taste,9,12 October 2013,"We have had a few fairly unremarkable adaptations of Scottish novelist Irvine Welsh's books, supporting the notion that with the one exception of Danny Boyle's phenomenal 'Trainspotting', his material remains pretty much impossible to put on the screen. Indeed, 'Trainspotting' itself was not a direct adaption as such, but rather an extrapolation of bits and pieces of it to make a cohesive narrative. In the Welsh lore, 'Filth' is put up there as one of the most difficult, and so it is with great surprise that Jon Baird's take on the book is not only a good piece of work, but also perhaps one of the most accomplished films of 2013! Our protagonist, as is so often the case with Welsh, is not a person we would choose to meet. Detective Sargent Bruce Robertson is mean-spirited, racist, sexist, aggressive, vindictive, with a psychiatric disorder and a bitter past that won't let him rest, which he seems most happy to appease with a regular cocktail of drink, cocaine and sexual debauchery behind his colleagues' and family's back. Manipulative and out for himself, Bruce has a plan to appear to be solving the case of a murdered local resident, whilst playing all his colleagues off one another with a view to clearing an easy path for his own promotion to Chief Detective.There are plenty of treats strewn through 'Filth', little cameos, smart, snappy dialogue, great jokes and wonderful performances from the likes of the ever versatile Jim Broadbent and Eddie Marsan. A subtle, schizophrenic soundtrack underscores so well the dark, cesspit nature of the journey the character is on, it raises the question, again, as to whether Clint Mansell will ever do wrong? The whole thing is shot with a seemingly intentional recklessness; an abandonment of sharp editing and an embrace of a sloppy, rough-around-the edges, almost unfocused approach make a film that feels as disgusting as the vomit spewing from character's mouths, both figuratively and, at times, literally! The star here, however, is James MacEvoy. There has been much said about his performance being an Oscar courting one; whilst there is no guarantee of that, I am confident in saying this is a career-best from him, and this cannot be overstated. Welsh has said he thinks MacEvoy is ""better than De Niro in Taxi Driver"", and whilst I do not know if I agree with that, we can certainly understand the comparison. MacEvoy is not a man one might immediately cast in this role, and so it makes it all the more impressive when we watch a performance that simultaneously keeps us at a distance and pulls us close; the actor manages to be completely vile, and yet convince us with an equal conviction that he is a man with a buried and forgotten heart that used to pump warmth; I have not seen this level of complexity so well delivered since Peter Mullan in 'Tyrannosaur'. Scabrous, nasty, cold and angry, yet obviously vulnerable and lost, this is a perfectly balanced, well-rounded performance, and MacEvoy is perhaps most impressive when he is being everything at once! In one such scene, he says, ""I used to be good at this job,"" which could well sum up Robertson's rather sad arc. Whatever your final take on him, we get a complete human being, and not one we ever feel the desire to condemn, despite all his awfulness.In the face of common opinion that it simply wouldn't work, and after years of development, 'Filth' turns out to be a near masterpiece, whose recognition as such is only made less likely by the inevitable comparison with 'Trainspotting'. It is a ballsy adaption of a hugely admired novel, as unpredictable as its central character and charged with the vitriolic energy of the author's writing. A well balanced juggling act of tones; in lesser hands this would have been a mess! It is not always a pleasant watch, but like the central character, it finds its way to a strange, engaging and even rather emotional resolution. Whilst there is likely to be a good forty percent of casual viewers who are left completely cold, the remaining will see a successful, proudly Scottish film that is by turns dark, shocking, comical and moving, which also goes out on an incredibly catchy and surprisingly fitting 70's hit! 'Filth' is the film we would hail as the Irvive Welsh-penned grenade of British cinema, if only Danny Boyle had not got there first.",Filth
82,sohansurag,And I am a Complete James McAvoy Fan now!,8,19 April 2014,"James McAvoy's 2013 British film productions started with Welcome to The Punch, then setting firm footing with Danny Boyle's splendid Trance and comes full circle with FILTH. Of the lot, this was the one movie that I so desperately wanted to see. Based on a novel by Irvin Welsh, who previously gave us the magnificent Trainspotting. While Welcome to The Punch came off as mediocre and Trance amazing, I still rooted for the FILTH. Despite its imminent comparisons with Bad Lieutenant, there was something enticing and beckoning about FILTH.Packed with relentless abuses, sex and copious amount drugs, Filth has every right to be named so. It wastes no time in introducing us to Bruce Robertson a bigoted, philandering, junkie cop who would stop at nothing to secure a promotion in an attempt to win his wife and daughter back. This is one helluva messed up guy we're talking about here, driven by the obsession for the promotion he constantly manipulates and maltreats his colleagues to the point it becomes impossible to root for this guy, yet you invest a lot in this character. There were scenes where he often broke The Fourth Wall addressing the audience, and it made me feel more involved with Bruce; it might be a reason why although we watch him manipulate, we still feel empathy for him. Flawlessly portrayed by James McAvoy, its his charms that makes us do so in the character, McAvoy steals it, every possible way he can and its no wonder he's won British Independent Film Award for Best Actor.Along with McAvoy, is a stellar cast which includes his colleagues, Imogen Poots, Jamie Bell, his best friend Eddie Marsan whom he bullies yet is true to Bruce and his psychologist played by Jim Broadbent. Jamie Bell and Eddie Marsan had a good share of screen time and does makes the most of it, but the gorgeous Imogen Poots did leave her presence felt with her albeit her comparably less time.The music is one of the finest points of Filth, having wonderful licensed tracks that goes perfectly in sync with the visuals. I was instantly in love with Scissor Sisters FILTHY which was featured in the previews. Clint Mansell once again creates magic with his compositions from start to end. Tracks, DS Bruce Robertson, Reeperbahn Madness stands out in particular.FILTH, most definitely ain't for everybody and it is depraved, sick and offensive. Underneath its cosmetic layers of depravity and filth lies a more subtle story and message that few people can comprehend, and of course the ending's a bit anticlimactic, but whatever be, I loved it to the core. Nonetheless it stands to be among the brilliant black comedies in recent times and could arguably end up in the best films of 2013 list. Be a lil filthy and just go with the flow. Until then ""Same Rules Apply!""",Filth
83,pcrprimer,James McAvoy delivers a strong performance but has a disjointed plot,6,9 June 2014,"We're instantly drawn to seeing what McAvoy will do just because he is so volatile and out there. He definitely puts everything into the movie, and it is necessary since he is in over 90% of the movie probably. There was a lot of very dark humour interspersed throughout the movie that gets a few laughs. The creepy hallucinations are really disturbing, while being scary and give us a window into the mind of a sick man. I understand that much of the plot was meant to be disjointed as the viewer pieced it together, but felt that there wasn't a big enough of a payoff. Also, it was difficult to understand the significance of the hallucinations.",Filth

These are arty classics in my mind which I love for different reasons.Filth, will join my list of trippy films, but it's by no means art. It will become a cult classic for sure. However, it's one of those films that you can't say you like, or you can't say you hate. You just have to go with it. You're basically on the same trip as Bruce Robinson. Yes, he's horrible, you feel nothing positive for his character, but you're not meant to. I mean, come on, It's an Irvine Welsh novel, so what do you expect?As one reviewer has also mentioned, this film is totally bonkers, it's off its head with some of the most vial scenes of drug taking, booze, sexism, misogyny & homophobia. Don't let this put you off. It's a roller coaster ride of paranoia, debauchery and twists and double crossing back stabbing.It's real life, people do exist like this. I actually know someone who does, although he's obviously not a friend anymore.The references to Kurbick however I found slightly irritating. Jim Broadbents character was a blatant rip off from A Clockwork Orange, just not as good yeaaaaaass",Filth
85,DubhDoo,Very twisted and very good,6,22 October 2013,"""I was disgusted and wanted to take a shower with a steel brush."" That was how Matthew McConaughey said he felt after reading the script for 'Killer Joe' for the first time. 'Filth', the latest Irvine Welsh adaptation, may provoke a similar response in many viewers, because it is very dark and twisted, with a main character that is homophobic, racist, sexist, misanthropic and misogynistic, rivalling and possibly surpassing Harvey Keitel in Abel Ferrara's 'Bad Lieutenant' as the most despicable on screen cop.The cop in question is Inspector Bruce Robertson, played magnificently by James McAvoy. After having appeared in 'Welcome to the Punch' and 'Trance' earlier this year, playing two good guys, McAvoy does the opposite, taking on the role of someone steeped in depravity and corruption. Subsequently, he delivers not only his best performance of the year with 'Filth', but also the best performance of his career. Thanks to McAvoy, I ended up sympathising and empathising with Bruce, even though I shouldn't. He is strongly supported by the always- watchable likes of Jamie Bell, Eddie Marsan and Shirley Henderson, while Jim Broadbent is delightfully delirious as the psychiatrist that Bruce regularly encounters in his visions.The plot is loosely concerned with Bruce attempting to get a promotion, but in reality, this is more of a character piece than a straightforward, plot-driven work; in that respect it's superficially similar to Nicholas Winding Refn's 'Bronson'. What we get are series of vignettes (Bruce goes to Hamburg, Bruce goes to a Christmas party, etc.), a structure that can difficult to get right, but Baird does, as every vignette is good, while aspects of Bruce's complex character are explored. Additionally, 'Filth' contains something that you won't find in any other film this year – the sight of David Soul as a taxi driver, bursting into song, singing his hit 'Silver Lady'. 'Filth's boldness makes it not for everyone – its comedy is jet black and scathing, while it doesn't shy away from explicitness or the dark depths of McAvoy's character, as he engages in sex, drugs and well, filth, doing everything from upsetting children to playing incredibly mean pranks on his 'friends'. It's also one of the best films of recent months.",Filth
86,TimMeade,James McAvoy Nails It,8,21 November 2013,"Any film adaptation of an Irvine Welsh book will always fall under the shadow of Trainspotting – the seminal and masterly interpretation of his 1993 novel. Trainspotting is a rare peak in the history of British cinema and it's inevitable that similarly themed films will invite comparison.Filth is the latest Welsh book to receive a screen outing. The story centres on police sergeant, Bruce Robertson (James McAvoy), whose sexually depraved and drug and alcohol-fuelled lifestyle is twinned with a Machiavellian desire to secure promotion over his colleagues. For Robertson, Gore Vidal's maxim that 'It is not enough to succeed – others must fail' seems to be his life philosophy. He plots and connives the downfall of those around him whilst ingratiating himself with seniors and those who can help his cause. He is a wonderful, nasty piece of work who will use any avenue – Freemasonry, sex, blackmail, perjury – to advance his cause – he makes Gene Hunt from Life on Mars look like Shirley Temple.The film is at its strongest in the first half of its 97 minutes. It charts, with graphic detail, Roberts' destruction of his rivals. The comedy is frequent and of the blackest shade – the cost of a laugh is a pained grimace. The humour fades away in the second half of the film as we follow Robertson's myriad demons spiral out of control. James McAvoy as the deeply damaged Robertson is quite simply outstanding at the heart of the film; giving one of his strongest performances, he will surely receive BAFTA if not Oscar recognition. The support acting is also of the highest order though McAvoy always dominates without ever being overbearing. Perhaps, and surprisingly, only Jim Broadbent fails to convince as the psychiatrist in the surreal, dream-like sequences which are a little over the top and break the film's flow. Occasional director Jon S. Baird pitches the pace of the film very well – fast without ever being confusing. Steady handed cinematography from Martin Jensen is also a plus with a fresh and sharp contemporary feel, which never tries to be too flash. It contrasts deftly Edinburgh's regal architecture with its seedy underbelly. An eclectic soundtrack adds to the ambiance: Shaking' Stevens Merry Christmas Everyone and David Soul, appearing in cameo, with Silver Lady were distinct highlights. Filth will never be considered a classic and it never quite rises to the heights of its illustrious predecessor, Trainspotting, which, on its release, seemed to capture a raw slice of British/Scottish life previously under-represented on celluloid. But it has enough virtue to stand on its own merit and will be enjoyed by those who consider themselves outside the 'Disgusted of Tunbridge Wells' demographic.",Filth
87,swellframe17,"""You see, there's something wrong with me.""",7,3 July 2014,"3 out of 4 stars.Jon S. Baird's 2014 film ""Filth"" lives up to its title. There's a lot of language, violence, sex, and drugs for one corrupt cop. You may want to take a shower after. ""Filth"" tells the tale of Bruce (played brilliantly by James McAvoy) as he tries to get a promotion by any means necessary. The story is based on the book by Irvine Welsh, who also wrote ""Trainspotting."" ""Filth"" and ""Trainspotting"" tackle similar issues in different ways, but I'll focus on ""Filth"" here. This is a very dark film that has moments of great humor and great drama. McAvoy takes us on a roller coaster of corruption and hallucinations. We do not have a stable narrator so pay close attention to what is happening. The film has its twists and turns that'll keep you on your feet. It's not a film for the easily offended. It can be like playing ""Cards Against Humanity"" at times. McAvoy gives a great performance that'll keep you laughing and emotionally engaged with the twisted Bruce. At times, the film can trail off into these drug induced sequences that slow the film down. It can be difficult to interrupt things at times and you may question why Baird chose to do some things. However, ""Filth"" is a dark comedy and psychological film that has strong performances and an engaging script.",Filth

I was recently amazed by James McAvoy's performance in 'Split' and already adored him as a young Professor X.Seriously, if you haven't seen 'Split', you really should.'Filth' is not for the faint hearted, and is prime fodder for 'Outraged of Halifax' in the Daily Mail comments section.It's a fun ride, like a manic episode can be (I have bipolar and some things felt far too familiar) but then things become tragic, as the depressive phase tends to be. I'm still a little bit miffed about the slightly OTT portrayal of bipolar disorder - it's not a totally accurate account of the illness (hence 9 stars, not 10) - but it's nice to see someone at least try to explore it.The denouement had me sobbing like a 'little bitch with a skinned knee', to quote Jay from 'Dogma' (also a wonderful film you should watch immediately) and the very end was when I really started blubbing.As a Scot and a bipolar type 1, this felt a little too close to home and that's why I adore it.

I knew I should hate him yet he was so much fun to watch. The way he goes about his life is so very cheeky and naughty you want to like him, especially his ease with women. Yet behind it all is a deeply troubled man.I really want to talk more about this film but it's difficult to remain spoiler free. Just go see it!

91,ferni-tierni,Too filthy and REAL.,10,6 May 2020,"Brilliant RAW depiction of how people that are bombarded by guilt, shame, and severe mood swings can degenerate into immorality and mental problems. Have you ever felt an emotion so strong that you cannot contain it and it takes over your entire day? Have you felt unable to connect lovingly with people because your state of mind is so damaged by your past? If you did, then you will be able to connect with the protagonist in, maybe, unsettling ways.Bruce (James McAvoy) is a relentless, audacious, vulgar, racist, homophobe, sadist that is on a mission: He is playing ""the game"". This game will outmaneuver and outsmart all his coworkers for a chance of a promotion. He is willing to do absolutely what is necessary to get to his goal, even if this means reaching the lowest of levels of depravity: lying, stealing, drug abuse, reckless sex, physical abuse. The movie does not hold any punch. It delivers an extraordinarily powerful expression of decadence that sometimes you can't help but feel pain and squirm as Bruce repeatedly manages to impress us.Bruce is one of the easiest characters to hate that I have seen in years. He is sarcastic, condescending, abusive, duplicitous, sociopathic, persistent, and abrasive: His personality is amusing though. His actions are the ones that bring disgust or pain in some instances. He is playing games with everyone, lying to the coworkers directly to their face; it is all a game to him, a game that took a serious turn when his subconscious started to invade his perception with hallucinations and paranoia. His mind could not take the repercussions and guilt, so it started to gradually dominate him until he had no option but to confront everything simultaneously: his self-concept, identity, circumstances, self-esteem, and loneliness.This movie is so evocative, arousing. Few movies have made me feel as strong as Filth. It confronts you with your reaction to grotesque, unforgiving immorality and then shows you a why that demonstrates the psychology of Bruce: You get to feel compassion and care at the end, despite all his flaws and antics. The movie is a masterpiece. The dialogue is witty, comedic, interesting, and vulgar. The twists reveal so much about the mental journey of the protagonist. The only drawback and it is a big one: the movie is way too vulgar and FILTHY for the common viewer.",Filth

He was disgusting, real, and above all absolutely gripping.

As he falls further into his web of lies and deceit he is drawn deeper into drug addiction which causes his life to spiral out of control.I actually saw this film a few weeks ago and couldn't really make up my mind about it until I'd really sat and thought about it. It's so brutal and twisted and leaves you feeling like you've been slapped round the face when it ends. Yet, once you started thinking about it and strip all the punch out of it, it's just very honest in dealing with some incredibly difficult topics that most films usually gloss up a little. It's not afraid to hit you where it hurts and I was so impressed with the way it manages to be disturbing without being hugely offensive at the same time. As the story unfolds so does Bruce's mind and there are some huge plot twists that really take you by surprise. James McAvoy is outstanding as the corrupt policeman – I haven't seen much of his work and the few films that I have seen haven't overly impressed me but his performance in this blew me away. The entire supporting cast is pretty strong too with some big names like Jamie Bell, Eddie Marsan and Jim Broadbent, as well as some smaller names, but McAvoy really does steal the limelight from start to finish.Filth is disturbingly dark and honest, almost a little too much, which is why I didn't rate it higher.

They really did it in a great way. 
This movie is about a human version of betrayal. Corruption, deceiving, backstabbing, manipulation, lie, malicious madness act that one person owns. 
What you think of a trusted perfect friend, doesn't always appear that way.
Some of the scenes might not be comfortable for some people, yet it is necessary to show how corrupted a human can be. It is vulgar, yes, the rating is there for a reason. 
But it is an honest exploration of a damage person when he catches the mental illness, a defense mechanism for the denial of a reality he can not bear, and it leads him to be the evil person. The story itself, i'm gonna say it's a dark comedy. It is so very dark and so very wrong, and it becomes a comedy. It is funny in some way, but in the same time it is also disturbing in another way. James McAvoy delivers the deep message very well with such a strong performance, that will build a love-hate relationship for the lead role. You will hate him for all the thing he did, yet you can understand why he did it. All the madness is so realistic portrayed by the actor. And in the end, we can only feel pitiful to the lead role.

95,benjamin-ryan,Filth a review,8,23 March 2014,"""I've got news for this herd of donkeys. There will be only a winner, and it's Bruce 'The Stallion' Robertson.""Set at Christmastime in the 90's, at Edinburgh Scotland, Filth (based on the novel of the same name by Irvine Welsh of Trainspotting fame) is a dark comedy drama that is both disturbing and disgusting. With a title and synopsis like this it lives up to it's namesake which gives the viewer an idea of what to expect. From the get go, James McAvoy, who plays the titular character Bruce Robertson, is quickly established as an unlikeable anti hero and as the movie progresses the acts he participants in just makes him even more despicable but on the other hand due to the strength of McAvoy's acting and the script I couldn't help but like Robertson he was smart, intelligent, cunning and very manipulative. Thanks to McAvoy's excellent acting I was questioning throughout the movie whether there was a little good in Robertson, or whether he would redeem himself by the end of the movie. The strong supporting cast also made sound contribution but I felt as the movie focuses on Robertson the cast weren't in it as much as expected. This was a shame as the pedigree of the actors was high calibre. The games Robertson plays with his fellow colleagues, who are all vying for promotion, and the way he turns them against each other is truly hilarious and one of the highlights of the movie.The brisk pace of the movie ensured that I wasn't bored, yet there were times where I found the movie hard to follow as numerous questions were raised which kept the viewer interested and guessing to the end. While I didn't have an issue with the thick Scottish accent, it may be a problem for some viewers. The imagery used throughout the movie luckily answers most questions that were raised but I did walk away with more questions which the novel covers in more depth.It's established quarter way through the movie that Bruce Robertson is suffering from some form of mental illness, where he suffers hallucination sequences, he see things and in the last act his mental health takes a downward spiral but so does the quality of the movie which I thought started to falter towards the end.Halfway through the movie Robertson and his friend Bladesey, played by Eddie Marsan, go on holiday to Hamburg. This is accompanied by a film grain/screen filter technique which is specifically used for this scene. I found it very effective making this scene unique, in fact a stand out.Filth is an excellent movie however due to limited release in some countries and still not released in the USA, has certainly flown under the radar. McAvoy is outstanding and this is one of his best performances yet, the all star supporting cast do an excellent job as well. This movie will keep you guessing until the end with a surprising twist.8/10 Benjamin Ryan 23/03/14",Filth
96,gloriahur,"Just an Ordinary ""Creep""",8,13 March 2017,"In the beginning of the movie, this movie just seems like a movie about a corrupt cop trying to outwit his way to promotion. Although he seems like a skilled detective in solving criminal cases, his bottomed out power to control his personal life is shown in various ways throughout the movie. There is suspense about the murder case as well in the movie that reveals its truth along with the hidden background story of the cop's personal life that has ultimately caused the tragedy of his mental status. I would describe this movie as an emotional or psychological thriller. Although the murder case itself may put this movie in the genre of crime/action/thriller, the focus of the movie is more on the development of the emotional status of the character himself. This movie solely concentrates of the story of a single man. And as the main character of the movie, James McAvoy has done an amazing job delivering the message. I think it is one of his best pieces. The contrast between the expression on his face that seems tough and his slightly shaking and watering eyes precisely shows the sentiments of Bruce, the cop. In the end of the movie, although it ends tragically, it leaves a strong impression to the viewer, and I personally thought that the song ""Creep"" by Radiohead fit in very well with its context. Anyone might have the experience of being abandoned or hurt, and while being devastated, in trying to fix the problems that cannot be turned back, turn into a ""creep"" in others' eyes.",Filth

99,RolltheClip,A dirty cop story from the twisted mind of Irvine Welsh,7,20 March 2014,"When the first five minutes of a film involve Santa pissing up a wall and what appears to be the cast of 'The Lost Boys' beating up a man in an alleyway, you have the basic grasp of Jon Baird's adaption of Irvine Welsh's novel. Twisted and brash, this movie really lets you into the mind of Detective Sergeant Bruce Robertson, played by the multi faceted James McAvoy. Narcissistic, misogynistic, sexist and nihilistic.These are all words that fit the troubled protagonist in the feature as he lies and manipulates his way through his colleagues in an attempt to attain a promotion come the new year, turning them all on each other whilst he sleeps with their wives and teases them into a state of vulnerability.For the main character to be so despicable, yet so likable is a testament to McAvoy's skills as an actor as he hones in on his ability to play the arrogant arse-hole, often breaking the fourth wall as he literally winks at the viewer which goes well with the humour within, all as black as sin.Throughout, the picture is littered with drug-use, sex and profanity reminiscent of similarly themed films such as the great 'In Bruges' which married both elements well.Initially portraying itself as a comedy it soon spirals downwards into the Detective Sergeants psyche. Hand in hand with his god complex and paranoia, he slowly unravels as he realises how despicable he has become. When he is alone, he becomes a completely different character altogether, lonely and self-loathing. Perhaps he is awful to his co- workers in an attempt to make other people miserable so he doesn't feel quite so abandoned and all his treachery is really a cry for help? I believe it has a vague resemblance to 'A Christmas Carol' as it has that moment of revelation, although it certainly isn't a film that will become family Christmas tradition.It's definitely a film which cannot be spoken about too much. It's an experience everyone has to judge for themselves, however, not all will enjoy it due to it's often gratuitous themes. It most certainly needs multiple viewings to let everything sink in, giving you the ability to re-evaluate angles after the reveal as I may spot many more idiosyncrasies that escaped me upon my first viewing. A bizarre adaption of Irvine Welsh's 1998 book, it transitions to the big screen well, being unforgiving in it's delivery as it pushes through it's visual onslaught. As Ray Lennox says, 'Don't start something you cannae f*cking finish'.",Filth
100,g-white723,Unfilmable story,6,1 November 2013,"Filth, the novel, was exciting and experimental, but because there are so many extremes in it, it is very difficult to sanitise it for a movie going audience. How do you make a talking tapeworm work on film? It is a character in the book. Very difficult. Compromises had to be made and some of the racism, sexism, homophobia etc etc had to be toned down if not cut out completely. I watched the film at a local (noisy) theatre. The performances were decent and the film was passable as pale reflection of the book, but I felt there were many edited cuts in the film which were bizarre. At one point David Soul (starring as a taxi driver) started singing his big pop hit from the 70's ""Silver Lady"". Jim Broadbent as Dr Rossi popped in and out of the film without much explanation of why he and Bruce ""Robbo"" Robertson were having these one to one sessions. Inspector Bob Toal is trying to write a book but it doesn't tie up with the rest of the film. Luckily I have read the book before and know the story well, but if I hadn't, I think I would be a bit confused. Stealing the show for me, is John Sessions as Chief Inspector Toal. He captures the character of the book as a traditional white police officer out of date in a modern world.",Filth

I have never followed a character as much as I have with Bruce. So many elements highlighted the anxiety and pain that Bruce has. The soundtracks shown all of the madness in a very sensual and rhythmic way. His hallucinations really did mimic with the way he was feeling and in fact spun my head around a few times. The acting by James McAvoy is by far one of the best I've seen. The moods swings where just ridiculously good to watch and the clash of them where really highlighted by James McAvoy. All the feelings that he engaged really felt similar to me in a surreal way.This film really goes above a beyond when telling the audience to just do one. We are doing what we want here. No Limitations. This film certainly provides an absolute perfect character recognition and you can instantly follow Bruce as the title sequence hits. There are a lot of brutality moments as well as hard sexual references that can be extremely offending to viewers but I usually look beyond this and find this hidden messages. If anyone hasn't watched this there would not be a film that I would recommend other than this.

104,NoFleshShallBeSpared,Potential not realized but not entirely necessary,8,20 April 2016,"How this film didn't do better is somewhat puzzling, but then again, it's also nice to see a film to held in high regard get slagged for not living up to it's potential. But I still loved this flick despite the structural weaknesses in plot that arise from trying to re-write source material to be more palatable a la' Kick-Ass 2. Still, as someone who has first-hand experience of the sort of world this movie inhabits (mental-instability in military-institutions such as a police force) I gotta say this film nails it. James MacAvoy is great, but he also has a great cast to support him. Everyone in real-space gives Bruce Robertson the kind of reactions that are a subtle hint that they know something's going on upstairs, but understand how pointless it is to engage the beast within. The pacing works well with Bruce Robertson's descent into desolation and sells the portrayal very well. Still, the source material (of which I am not immediately familiar) seems to be somewhat lacking here, it would definitely have helped to make the ending what it needed to be (plus who doesn't want to see a hanging cop evacuate a tapeworm?) I found that the whole tone at the end to be uneven in proportion to real-space (how is he in trouble?!! He essentially solved the murder, as opposed to being the murderer like he was in the book!!!) Bruce occupies. I would've accepted him committing suicide even if he got the promotion, such is the beast that is bipolar personality disorder. It's these details that I believe ate up the pure star power here. I can't hate this film, I actually found myself in love with the heart put into this film, albeit a capricious heart the likes of Bruce Robertson. Sometimes a movie doesn't need much more, and this movie is such an example.",Filth
105,worshipthylouie,"""Grimy, disgusting, raunchy, mucky, unclean, gross, mucky, dirty and all the other synonyms of filth perfectly describe this film"".",8,20 January 2014,"Based on a 1998 novel of the same name, written by Irvine Welsh, Filth will bury your television screen in dirt. It will require you to wipe dust off of your Ipad. Movie theaters showing this film will not be clean anymore, and be reminiscent of walking into a porta-potty.Viewers will also be affected, and likely have a irresistible urge to take a shower. Nasty thoughts will linger into your mind a few days, or even weeks after watching it. Filth personifies filth just as the title suggests. It depicts a Scotland, where the majority are dirty, and far from clean cut.Lead man position is given to rising Scottish star James McAvoy, who has experienced American fame with his roles in Wanted or X-Man: First Class. In the latter, he played Charles Xavier, or Professor X, for those unaware. The character he portrayed in that film is far from what you'll see here, as McAvoy takes a turn for the worst.People are accustomed to seeing him play the good guy, but his role as Detective Bruce Robertson calls for the total opposite. And I am going to come right out saying that his acting was top notch quality. At age 34, McAvoy is still in his prime, and capable of making a huge impact in the cinema.Detective Sergeant Bruce Robertson has only one current goal in life. Edinburgh needs a detective investigator, and Bruce feels he is the only one deserving of the role. He appears to be the top contender for the title, after being assigned to oversee an investigation in regards to the death of a Japanese student.Problems lie in the mental health of Bruce, which causes severe hallucinations. As Jesus is to God, Bruce is to the devil. Terrible, mean, manipulative, and does not care about a single soul. A master of mind games, a druggie and someone who is willing to resort to sexual abuse, assault, or murder to get what he wants.His chase for the criminals responsible becomes hindered by his fascination to destroy the lives of everyone around him. Throughout the tale, puzzles pieces of how he came to be will be thrown relentlessly at you.I was intrigued the whole ride through this crazy world, and by the end, everything is explained leaving no lingering plot holes. If you believed Wolf on Wall Street's Jordon Belfort was an awful person, Bruce Robertson will shock you even further.While I can draw comparisons between the two all the day, I brought it up more-so to point out the difference. Belfort did what he did for the money and fast life excitement. Robertson turned into a monster due to the events in his life. You'll gain an understanding to some point, and shockingly, may have some sympathy towards this despicable human being.Flashbacks, hallucinations and crazy nights out intoxicated help connect the dots plot points. And provide some of the humour. Filth lives up to being a dark comedy with its laugh out loud material. I found myself giggling and shaking my head multiple times at the craziness unfolding on screen.So far, I have only pointed out that McAvoy did a good job acting. Eddie Marsan was perfect in his role as Clifford Blades. A man Bruce loved to manipulate and the only person he considered a friend. Marsan's portrayal of the gullible loser managed to be extremely special and memorable.Everyone else did a near perfect job as well, so I'd be listing a whole ton of names, and having to leave some deserving out, so I will just leave it at that instead. Cinematography by Matthew Jenson could not have been better, and helped push this unique viewing experience to greatness.It must be acknowledged that not everyone will walk away from this film with a smile. As I have pointed out, the film resembles filth when it comes to actions, personality traits, offensiveness and the like. The hallucinations that I found creative, and a fun dive into insanity may come off as stupid, silly and poorly made to others.It is one of those films so messed up that it can go either way. For me, Filth worked wonders, and joins the top rank of movies I loved coming out of 2013. This crazy fun, dive into the dark-side, is well worth the journey.Superpower Film Scale: 4/51: Villainous Waste2: Careless Bystander3: Hero unaware of powers4. On the verge of greatness 5.

The film did make me feel extreme heights of emotion (the ending, especially, gave me this little jolt of anxiety in my stomach), and I suppose that's what a film is supposed to do - however, none of these emotions were of a positive nature. A lot of the scenes in this movie really disturbed me and I was left thinking about them for days afterward, wondering if I could ever wipe them out. In the end, I think they tried to make another 'Trainspotting' and it just didn't go to plan, as there was nothing even remotely laughable about any of this film, and at least Trainspotting had some moments of comedy to detract from the negative subject matter.This film, though it started out quite funny, quickly descended into depressing and scary places that I was just not prepared to go.

109,deanpjackson_1973,Eagerly awaited.,9,26 January 2014,"Being an Irvine Welsh fan I eagerly awaited this films release. Thankfully, it didn't disappoint. It is pretty much as the book. I preferred the book, certainly worth reading if you haven't already. However, I would consider it a very good attempt at putting it on the big screen. It certainly did no harm to the book and was well and creatively put together. Capturing Welsh's dark and surreal tales would always be a difficult challenge and to even get near it would require considerable thought, creativeness and talent. Doing this whilst trying to appeal to a wider audience would no doubt be a tightrope. McAvoy proved himself, again, to be an very good actor. Eddie Marson played his part very well too, although he never seems to get the credit he deserves. All in all, very well acted. I would personally like the same people and cast to attempt more Irvine Welsh, perhaps Marabou Stork Nightmares, although it appeal may be limited. Definitely worth seeing and certainly a very good film, especially if you want to see something with a little more thought than mass produced Hollywood type nonsense.I have given it a 9 to try and get the score up to 8-9 as it's got to worth 8 plus.",Filth

There was weird sex, masturbating, murder, drugs. Pretty much everything offensive that you could think of is in this film. It made me laugh, cringe and frown at some of the ridiculous stuff that happened in it.Deep in the storyline though, was an utterly captivating, yet tragic story of a man loosing his mind to drugs, mental illness and grief. In many ways it was this that made the film all the more shocking, but brilliant at the same time. I came out of the theatre speechless, I had no idea what to make of it or think. Now I have thought about it, I can see how good it really was. James McAvoy gave a perfect performance in the lead role. Everything about the character that he portrayed was realistic, and I could feel the emotion coming out of him throughout his descent into madness.This film is not for the faint of heart or easily disturbed, but if you can deal with the weird and wacky, then you are going to love it.",Filth

112,thefoxzzwlgames,Definitely not unambiguous,7,20 June 2021,"A very interesting tape that struck and made you think about many things .This mix of genres is just incredibly cool.1. Humor is one of the many things that make this movie worth watching. Of course, this picture can not be recommended to everyone, but fans of Irvine Welsh's work should definitely take a look. The humor is cool and always on the topic.2. And the best thing is that this is not only an entertaining movie, but also teaching someone who does not need to be. And the main character is a perfect confirmation of this. Bruce Robertson is very ambiguous immoral, cruel, cynical but with all this it is a pity for him because he is an ordinary person who tried to be what he was not, he wanted to be cool and did not dare to admit his weakness and his environment only encouraged him to be an inveterate creature. I feel sorry for him only because he is a simple person who is very unlucky if he delves into the problem of why he is the way he is.3. Acting and casting is one of the main advantages, after watching it, there is a feeling that if you substitute other actors, it will be different and not at all such a powerful impression from the tape.4. The music is also on top like everything in the film especially the song ""Creep"" at the end if it wasn't there I think the atmosphere of the scene changed and it wouldn't be so sad.Conclusion: The feeling of complete emptiness and sadness is what every viewer will feel after watching. A very instructive movie because of which you rethink your actions and that you should be kinder. As Bruce Robertson said, "" The rules are the same.""
Evaluation:7.8.",Filth
113,Botsu,"Could've easily been better, pretty mediocre nonetheless",5,13 April 2014,"I went into watching this movie having read it was ""from the creator(s) of Trainspotting"", thinking it was another collaborative effort by all- star Scottish writer Irvine Welsh and Danny Boyle, a Scottish director that had already proved his talent with 1996's aforementioned coming-of- age masterpiece, and I have to admit, in the first quarter to 20 minutes of the film, I didn't even realize it, showing complete mystery Jon S. Baird was doing a great job. Same great (!) introduction, same saucy accents, same razor sharp jokes throughout, same amount of things just plain wrong with the things shown on-screen, only improving the experience as a whole: a sense of repulsion bundled to the spectacular mindf*ck that is a typical Danny Boyle movie. But after that great start, the movie shoots itself right in both its kneecaps as it throws away all its consistencies and provides a flaw so big, it practically makes the movie near-unwatchable and just hilariously inappropriate at moments to me, in all the worst ways. For real, if some completely theme-shifting plot elements were implemented differently or outright removed from the film (horribly far-fetched twist, I'm looking at you), I'm convinced it could've easily been a whole lot better, because as it is, it really just tries to exceed in everything and ends up doing none of the things it's going for right. Does it want to be a pitch-black comedy? A trippy voyage through the mind of what you could basically call some kind of sick psycho, with accompanying twists? Or is it going for a drama kind of feel, delivering sad and gripping moments on the right occasions? I didn't know after I watched ""Filth"", you probably won't know, and the director obviously didn't know either. High hopes crushed by inconsistencies despite its potential sums up my thoughts for Jon S. Baird's ""Filth"". With a remarkable performance by James McAvoy, I might add, for whom it interests.",Filth

I am no fan of James McAvoy, but the thought of him playing a bi-polar, drug-taking cop on the verge of promotion seemed good for a laugh.The film seemed quite entertaining for the first 30 or so minutes, then it degenerated into a heaving mass of shock tactics, sex scenes, seedy clubs, more drug-taking, hallucinations and swearing.It's a horrible mish-mash of nothingness; I genuinely wanted to give McAvoy the chance to shine. Instead, this film just tries to be ""the new Trainspotting"", but in truth it is NOTHING like that. At several points I thought to myself ""Oh, they're going to end it here"". Instead it went on. And on. And on.I am no prude and like a good amount of bad language, black comedy but this fails to hit the target in a huge way.

McCavoy is great, and the rest of the cast does do a good job, but this is just existentialist drivel.

The film details the struggles of a man that has many demons of the past haunting him which causes him to act as a menace to his friends and co-workers. The man is clearly broken in so many ways and as the film go's along it becomes more clear what the demons haunting him are. This performance is truly magnificent and is one of the best performances of that year. The charcuterie has such an interesting and unpredictable arc that makes you hate him but also root for him. The balance of flashbacks and visualizations is not only and interesting layer of cinematography but also adds another layer of exposition to describe the psychosis being endured.

118,swivelhips,The same old same old from Welsh,3,9 December 2013,"This latest Welsh adaptation is yet another feeble attempt to shock your granny. The most shocking thing about it, however, is that talented actors like James McAvoy, Jim Broadbent, Jamie Bell and Eddie Marsan all agreed to take part in it. Don't get me wrong - I'm all for movies that take risks and push the boundaries but this is just a tired and vastly inferior stab at recreating the success of 'Trainspotting'. The difference between the two films is the quality of the writing. The characters in 'Trainspotting' were every bit as flawed and morally reprehensible as any character in 'Filth' but in the hands of a skilled writer like John Hodge, the humanity of characters (Begbie aside) still managed to shine through. Welsh and his co-writer (and director) Jon Baird have at least attempted to do the same with a back story for McAvoy's character but the problem is he's just so unpleasant that it's hard to feel any sympathy for him.Welsh's feature length screen writing credits have all been co-written and therein lies the problem, I feel. As the most famous one in the partnership it must be difficult for his writing partner to rein him in. And since subtlety has never been the strong suit of Welsh what we always seem to end up with is a check list of scenes and moments that are designed purely to shock. The trouble is, we've all seen them so often now they don't have the same impact they once had - in fact, they just seem a bit tired. If the subject matter is what is tempting you to go and see this film do yourself a favour and rent a copy of Abel Fererra's 'Bad Leuitenant' instead.",Filth

I assume that this kind of ""clawing"" at his junk may have been deemed too un-sexy for, what I thought, was an excellent performance by James McAvoy.The ending is a little weak with a very different moral of the story shock outcome than from the original, but still holds up.SPOILER ALERT!!!!

The brilliance couples with the main role's performance played by James McAvoy. I think he truly masters the shifts of characteristics and he proved it with ""Trance"" and ""Split"".

It was unlike anything you'd ever seen in your entire life. This will mess your head up and that's great. It's just that you have seen stuff like this before, and that's just a little disappointing.The film takes place in Scotland, focusing on the Scottish police force and one particular officer Bruce Robertson. An aspiring officer hoping to get promoted and you've read the blurb so I'll just get on with it.To start, it's very funny. It's got Irvine Welsh's sense of humour all over it. It's offencive to everyone. It involves homophobia, drinking, drugs, sex, masturbation and pretty much anything you can think of that can be deemed offencive this film has and makes it funny. Yet, in the midst of all this, there's this deeply psychological (and extremely worrying) sub-story that keeps reoccurring throughout. This I was not expecting. It's very dark and emotional. The visual are terrifying, and the denouement is particularly touching and haunting, as well as being weird as hell and surreal-ly strange.There are a few plot points that at first can seem a little unneeded, but later make sense thinking about it. However, even after rethinking it, they still seem a little unnecessary. One thing I can say however, is that it is never boring, as the story does move at a great pace, and is always, at the very least, quite interesting.The acting is incredible. James McAvoy is brilliant, his portrayal of this emotionally and psychologically disturbed man is spot on, as well as humorous at times. Jamie Bell is great, acting as a building block for McAvoy's powerful performance, however in doing so does get pushed to the background quite easily, and doesn't make much impact on the film or story as a whole. Jim Broadbent however is perfect as McAvoy's subconscious doctor, and portrays what could very well be, the living embodiment of everything Irvine Welsh has ever written. From start to finish, in this role, totally mental. This is a perfect addition to the film.Final Grade: B It's a wild ride, with some unexpected moments. However it's not entirely original, with much of it being seen before. However with the new comedy twists and that dark sense of humour so often found in Welsh's novels, being perfectly replicated on the big screen. It's definitely one for Trainspotting fans, just don't be expecting quite as much from this one.For more please visit... http://wp.me/4w7bk",Filth

Many people here compared Filth to Trainspotting and the decay of humanity in both, but I think Filth has different connotations also through the episodes of hallucination that actually show the true faces of people: animals. Of course we also have hallucinations in Trainspotting, but with James McAvoy, as he stated - Filth took him to the ""dark places"" of existence, living the dream of being advanced in position, mostly for his wasted family, but finally embodying his wife in a sinister transvestite night play that eventually kicks the chair under his feet. Definitely you should watch this movie if you enjoyed Trainspotting, I personally think James McAvoy had one of his best roles ever, and with Filth, he had the courage to open the door of taboos, as did Michael Fassbender in ""Shame"". This is reality today: mental illness, porn, pig-headed people forming society.I gave it 7.5/10, the script could have been more intriguing and secondary characters more involved in the plot, but James McAvoy comes with another shocking display of personality coming shortly after ""Trance"" PS: the tunnel scene reminded my of another good movie I would recommend to watch (in the series of human&social decadence) : Irréversible with Vincent Cassel.",Filth

127,biggob100,Baird you are fantastic,10,7 December 2013,"Jon S. Baird has recreated the Irvine Welsh novel #Filth with stunning ferocity. Having not read the book I went to see this film with no preconceptions. James McAvoy is the protagonist Bruce Robertson, who we quickly realise is scum, but no the kind that you scrape off your boot, but the kind that clings to your boot and no matter what you use you can't remove it and you can smell it wherever you go kind of scum. McAvoy is phenomenal in this role and really brings the character to life. Alongside McAvoy is Imogen Poots, Iain De Caestecker, Joanne Froggatt, Jamie Bell, Eddie Marsan, Jim Broadbent, Shirley Henderson and Emun Elliott. Respectively they play the characters Amanda Drummond, Ocky, Mary, Ray Lennox, Bladesey, Dr. Rossi and Bunty. There really isn't a fault in the step of the performance from any of the players. I won't lie I was immensely confused through the second act, but I'm feeling it's supposed to be like that because as the third act comes around things start opening up. How it was all fitted into the 97 minutes running time is beyond me. The story is amazing and rolls at a very bumpy pace, there are places where you think is this really necessary, but in truth it really is. There are a few special effects but it is all of the natural kind, blood, cuts that sort of thing. the script for this film is outstanding and it is delivered effortlessly by all the actors. I'm assuming most of it was lifted straight from the novel, but it really helped to convince us of the characters. Superb. The soundtrack to the film is solid, you know like how Pulp Fiction had an amazing soundtrack. This is another one like that. The music really shows the film in all the glory it is.

Bruce was not bipolar, he was surely and unfortunately for him schizophrenic. That should be corrected in the description as it is not an accurate portrayal of the bipolar community. I say this because even though they are both serious mental conditions, they are different from each other and should not be confused with one another. I work very closely with both conditions and the word bipolar seems to be hurled about in ignorance and yes, I realize that the same can be said about schizophrenia. That being said, this film is definitely worth watching. It is imaginative, unapologetic, and the acting is superb. If you like something different this is for you.

133,benbarnes0606,I guess the title says it all with this movie.,4,28 February 2017,"First let me state that I only watched this piece of garbage movie because of the enormous amount of respect I have for author Irvine Welsh, having said that you can probably guess that I am a massive fan of Danny Boyle's masterclass of a film 'Trainspotting'. This movie is not like trainspotting: Meaning this is a piece of steaming garbage and trainspotting is a masterpiece. I didn't go in expecting it to be as good as trainspotting, I only expected a wild Scottish ride of drugs, sex and violence that author Irvine Welsh so clearly loves to write about. And to a certain extent i guess it delivered but it wasn't tasteful, it wasn't funny and it wasn't wild. It was a boring waste of time with a terrible main character that is one of the biggest scumbags ever portrayed in film history and is in no way charismatic or likable. But to go back to trainspotting, Mark Renton is a scumbag to a certain extent as well but he has charisma and a drive to get out of his lifestyle, and the most important thing, he stays true to his character. Unlike Bruce Robertson who I absolutely despise, and i could've excepted that if he stayed true to his character and had anything remotely redeeming about him.But does this movie deliver on the outrageousness that it claims it has. No not really its just pure filth, none of it has any purpose whatsoever, this movie feels like a teenage Disney star who try's to shed their image by being edgy and behaving poorly for no reason whatsoever. The only reason this movie doesn't get a worse overall rating is because it did have some film making merit in terms of the way it is shot and directed. James McAvoy does delivers a stellar performance in this film, its just a shame its not for a better movie.Bottom line is that this movie sucks, its terrible. Don't WATCH EVER!",Filth
134,katiekeane87,Very Disappointing,3,29 October 2013,"I'm actually shocked to be writing such a bad review for this title as I was so looking forward to Filth. If this review was based on performances alone, and not the whole package, I wholeheartedly think the whole cast deserve 10 stars. However the film itself was pathetic. Every part of the plot tries to shock. NEWSFLASH we've seen it all before. Im 26 years old n hardly prude but 90% of the film is sex and drugs for the sake of it. The characters are one dimensional which comes off as pantomime in most cases. The plot is unbelievable to the extreme. The whole film tries to be something it just cant live up to. I was waiting the whole way through for something thought provoking or even one original joke. Quite a lot of the film comes across as a pornographic version of The Hangover. Whoever watches this and thinks they're getting a peek into the real world, or getting to peer at the grimier side of life is like the writer, producer and director of this film ...seriousy out of touch. This will probably appeal to the bored middle classes and school children. Quick tip...save your money and watch Jeremy Kyle",Filth
135,Mr_Recchia,"A relentless, rampaging march towards incoherency.",5,20 February 2015,"There are adult films, there are really adult films, and than there is a unique class onto its own, singularly occupied by Filth, in which its overt and obtrusive adultness swings full circle into childishness. This works, in its own perverse way. The most effective scenes are ones that make your inner teenager squeal in delight, and as frequent and obsessive as they are in showcasing this film's ironic strengths in full glory, against all critical instincts, you end up wishing style and depravity was all this film shot for.The sooner you give up on the story, the better. The first half is mostly clusters of heavy exposition force fed through thick, kinda-sorta-not-really comprehensible Scottish accents, and complex, fuzzy details, that, at the end of the day, you know boils down to the main character screwing his co-workers over to win the promotion. Half hour in I stopped caring, and decided that the main character, played with brilliance and conviction by the underrated James Macavoy, is entertaining enough to focus most of my attention on. Luckily, this was well before the second half, where things gets bizarrely bad.Scenes, sub-plots, and moments of ""huh"" are haphazardly strung together, with a sort of incoherence that becomes more pronounced as the film trudges on. The tonal shifts are fast and frequent. We go from a sex comedy, to intense drama, back to comedy, to a Guy Ritchie knock off, to surrealism, and sudden horror style jump scare hallucinations right smack during said Guy Ritchie knock off, and straight back to comedy. The final half hour, knee deep in darkness, nihilism, despair, and hopelessness, is topped off by a character suddenly winking at the camera in a tongue in cheek manner, initiating a humorously quick closing title and animated short for credits. The jump scares themselves become tedious, and not even in a way in which you become desensitized. Jump scares have no place in any movie, especially a non horror. This jagged jerky roller coaster ride eventually drops up in one of the worst twists I've seen in years. There's no foreshadowing, it's based on a character that's shoe-horned into the film with awkward editing, and its just silly to behold when it happens. As stated, the strength of the film is the main character, which is odd considering the screenplay's almost grim determination to make him as unlikable as possible. He's a conceited, horn totting braggart, a racist, a homophobe and all sorts of many things. Every instinct tells you to hate this man, but you do feel sorry for him in the right places. Perhaps it's Macavoy's performance, or the effective (if somewhat cheaply tacked on) sympathetic back-story, or the fact that, all things considered, he is ridiculously entertaining to watch.Macavoy is nothing short of stellar here. He's insanely likable when he needs to be, insanely charismatic when he needs to be, extremely passionate when he needs to be, and puts Edward Norton and Robert De Niro to shame when it comes to fighting his inner machismo and executing a proper crying scene. You do sort of ""get"" his unlikable character in time, and you understand that he's messed up and too hopelessly dug into his situation to ever change. When this realization comes to light, and all the stakes are on Macavoy to make us care, he knocks it out of the park.Cinematography almost feels reminiscent of Superman: The Movie, using light to give the aesthetic an almost subtle fuzzy feel. The soundtrack involves cliché choices of song you've seen in every film trying to be cool and hip. Otherwise, the humor, narration and overall style is well directed and formed without feeling forced in spite of some choppy editing. I would have to give accolades to the director when it comes to how natural the dialogue sounds, morso than the writing itself. I can't imagine the screenwriter caring enough to make the characters talk so effortlessly, only to call it quits upon remembering he still has to make a story.Wheras Wolf of Wall street employed subtle and carefully constructed tonal shifts, Filth's attempt to emulate the same drug addled experience is too forced to be believable. The results is like watching someone else undergo the effect himself. Aggravated, annoyed and almost perversely speculative of the possibility it's better to be him than you right now.52%",Filth
136,foreverundawnted,"Movie Review: Filth is a Tragic-Comedy about Office Politics, Mental Illness, and the Downward Spiral",9,18 October 2021,"Filth is the story of a Scottish police officer who slips from normality into madness. Detective Sergeant Bruce Robertson is out of control when he is sober, but when drugs and alcohol are introduced to an already fragile mind, he loses his grip on reality: totally, completely, fully.Mental illness is the elephant in the room in Western society. This film shows the descent from barely hanging on to outright unhinged. The movie is a statement piece, and perhaps we should heed its warning.The humor (is it Scottish humor? Because I am checking my Scottish heritage card here) is repulsive at best: sex, drugs... and dance music. The writer is Scottish, we'll give him a break. If you like Blazing Saddles, then a film like Filth will not phase you.*****FilthScheming Bruce Robertson (James McAvoy), a bigoted and corrupt policeman, is in line for a promotion and will stop at nothing to get what he wants. Enlisted to solve a brutal murder and threatened by the aspirations of his colleagues, including Ray Lennox (Jamie Bell), Bruce sets about ensuring their ruin, right under the nose of unwitting Chief Inspector Toal. As he turns his colleagues against one another by stealing their wives and exposing their secrets, Bruce starts to lose himself in a web of deceit that he can no longer control. His past is slowly catching up with him, and a missing wife, a crippling drug habit and suspicious colleagues start to take their toll on his sanity. The question is: can he keep his grip on reality long enough to disentangle himself from the filth?IMDB*****Spoiler Time*****The BreakdownBruce Robertson is a cruel, unapologetic Scottish police officer who treats people as he views the need to treat himself: with disdain, disrespect, and disloyalty. Since childhood, Bruce Robertson has suffered tragedy and guilt. He has bipolar disorder, for which he takes pharmaceutical medication as well as self-medicates with drugs, sex, and alcohol. The audience comes to understand that Bruce is an unfortunate and miserable soul, as he is remorseful over the death of his brother (an accidental death he caused) from childhood, his wife with their daughter has left him for another man, and he dresses up as his wife to feel a connection to his family. He is a man without hope, looking for redemption in a promotion to Detective Inspector.When he is demoted from Detective Sargent to Constable for having his emotional, mental breakdown in full view of his colleagues, he plans his suicide. A knock on the door happens right as he is about to commit suicide. Does Bruce Robertson die at the end by his own hand, or is he saved by the woman he wishes he was good enough for? I think we all know the answer to that question.R. I. P. Bruce.This film has been rated: 7.1/10 Stars on IMDB.*****The ReviewBruce Robertson: The games are always, repeat always, being played. But nobody plays the games like me. Detective Sergeant Bruce Robertson, soon to be Detective Inspector Bruce Robertson. You just have to be the best, and I usually am. Same rules apply.Although the film is disheveled in places where the pacing of the film is discordant with the plot, the plot itself meanders, its ribald comedic nature and dramatic death spiral, as the audience, we must understand we are seeing the world from Bruce Robertson's point of view. And, Bruce's point of view is unraveling before our eyes. We are descending with him into insanity.Without an anchor of his wife and daughter, Bruce has no reason to remain stable or good or kind. Bruce has no reason to be stable, good, or kind to himself. He is crying out for help, and yet no one can see the desperate state he is in. A police department trained to see the signs of instability in the public is unprofessional and uncaring when the same characteristics present themselves in one of their own officers.The games people play... with other people's mental health.Thank you, James McAvoy, cast and crew, and Irving Welsh for bringing to light the horrible necessity for so many people to shove mental illness under the rug. Yet, hiding mental illness means that the problem goes unresolved. Filth is a tragic-comedy (black comedy) that isn't about depravity, profanity, or obscenity of a rogue police officer. This film is about the indecency of our society that ignores all the warning signs of mental illness and uses its own incompetence to ignore the cries of so many who require mental/emotional help.The tragedy of this film is one of society's failures.*****The TallyMy review will be posted on Prime as well as IMDB.Prime... 4 out of 5 starsIMDB... 9 out of 10 stars.Thank you, have a great and wonderful day...",Filth

Perfect casting, sharp and witty script, smoothly shot, distressingly funny, wonderfully weird with subtle hints of a homage to Trainspotting. Most importantly, FIlth kept me on the edge of my seat! James McAvoy is amazing throughout, and Jamie Bell is great in his supporting role.

I must say that this is a difficult film to watch. I ended up having to watch it in four approximately equal chunks, four days in a row, because I could only take so much of it before I went into sensory overload. I'm in total admiration of the leading actor, James McAvoy, who completely becomes the character and drives the film onward with brutal intensity. The use of almost subliminal flashes to this extent illustrates to some effect the descent into a state where we, the audience, follow him into a stage when it becomes hard to tell fantasy from reality. The sound track is both delicious and cleverly chosen to engage our emotions as our brain attempts to reconcile the familiar and no. 1 tune with the opposing or enhancing visual emotions caused by what's going on, on screen. It's the sort of film that is a bit too much to handle the first time and I feel that it will reward repeat viewing. Definitely not one for in front of the children.",Filth

If you can stomach the apparent gratuitously open prejudice then you will be in a better position to appreciate the depth of the character and the range of the issues being represented. Filth is a tour de force in the realm of depictions of uncomfortable truth.

147,khabyuliya,Do you believe yourself?,8,8 April 2016,"Meet Bruce. He's got an excellent wife, a dream job with good prospects of promotion. He is the king of a hole he calls home. It is he who introduces all secondary characters to us, and it is through his perception we see the world where he lives, learn its rules, understand who we shall respect and at whom be disgusted. Meet Bruce's colleagues, all losers and perverts and potential hazards on his way to promotion, so he bullies them whenever it pleases him. Undoubtedly, Bruce is an douche, but to be a king you are bound to be a douche, otherwise you are in the team of losers. Moreover, being one you have lots of privileges, such as banging your boss's wife, bullying your colleagues, mocking on stupid though hot chicks. Sounds like the world you'd like to live. Providing you are ready to live in the filth as the world is the filth itself filled with abominable people who are miserable and pathetic and can make you feel nothing but pity. And Bruce is definitely the most miserable and pathetic one. Everything is so dirty that you start asking yourself: is there anybody worth sympathizing in this disgusting world? But everything changes closer to the middle of the movie and soon we see that the line which borders losers from kings is very thin, and that the notions are very often interchangeable. And rather soon we understand that all this mud is just decorations, the first layer under which one can see cleanness and purity. So, meet Bruce, a loser, a pervert, whose only dream is to humiliate his colleagues and get promotion. And meet his colleagues, who treat Bruce much kinder than he deserves. Be prepared to make your own judgment of what is going on, not relying on Bruce or whoever else.Everybody has their reasons, everybody is afraid of the world, everybody suffers. But does it give you the right to be a douche? How long must you behave as a douche to actually believe you are one? Is there any way out once you are in? Do any of events from your past justify your behavior in present? And is suicide the only way out? Try to answer these questions and not to lose in the game we call life.

And the movie is every bit as entertaining as that premise would lead you to believe.First and foremost James McAvoy turns in what has to be one of the best screen performances of the century, if not all time. He plays this character with tremendous energy, charisma, and enthusiasm. He is completely believable and compelling every second weather he is acting like a complete scoundrel, or actually being a surprisingly sympathetic character. Completely criminal that he got overlooked by the awards shows. Then again its quite a controversial character (to put it lightly)Pacing is also terrific. Things move so fast that it feels as though the film is on just as much cocaine as the main character is. The story is always interesting and fun to watch, and only rarely loses focus.The only main complaint is slight tonal inconsistency. As opposed to a film like In Bruges which keeps its drama and dark comedy intertwined more or less through out, Filth sometimes feels like it will arbitrarily switch between one and the other.Its a small complaint in an otherwise fantastic film.

There is a glimpse of humanity in him that shines and gives you a hope for redemption and happy ending.... Well...It is a downward spiral of a character who goes out with a sh+t show bang, not just a depressing low key slide. He let the medicine (figuratively too) slip away, and he saw his real self in the surreal.It shows what could happen if we let the insecure voice in our head take control in the most heart wrenching and hilarious hate-my-self-for-laughing-at-this way.You want to punch, hug, report, go to the doctor, fall in love and get drunk with Bruce all at the same time which is a testament to Mr. Mcavoys' craftsmanship.

For me it has done Irvine Welsh's novel proud showing the many depths of emotions through all character profiles and presented with interesting and artistic filmography.It has some very disturbing moments which are repeated throughout the film and although they have the tendency to make you jump, it is mainly out of empathy for the main character, which is a bizarre feeling as this is a character who should be disliked and seen as the bad guy. I think that this is one of the reasons this film has been so well executed. The way the one character has so many different sides but as the film goes on, it become much clearer how they all piece together to form this one emotionally ripped apart man.If you liked Trainspotting (yes this has probably been said so many times but it really is true) you really will love this too.

James McAvoy's performance is incredible and the author himself has said he thinks its better than De Niro in Taxi Driver. That might sound like a bold statement, but I don't think he's too far off.

He is guy on the verge on losing his sanity yet he refuses to get any help and do something about that. His main purpose in the entire movie throughout revolves around a promotion form Detective Sergeant to Inspector that gives him a reason to reunite with his wife and daughter. To fill the gap of intimacy he is prone to extreme casual sexual activities. That's totally understandable I enjoyed seeing that to some extent. Another reason of his suffering that he is alcoholic.

Although it's not at times pleasant to watch, referring the gritty content including drugs, sex, booze, violence and anything else you'd expect from a film called filth, its a comical (hilarious at times), heart-breaking and perfectly written story.I have to say this is probably the best I've ever seen James McAvoy perform, and I can imagine Bruce Robertson, the films troubled protagonist, being a very difficult character to play considering he's a self obsessed, depressive junkie suffering from hallucinations and serious mental problems. McAvoy exposes both the powerful and weak sides to this character effortlessly, and somehow still comes out at the end of it being a lovable character (well, at least for me). There are also fantastic performances from Jamie Bell, Shirley Henderson, Jim Broadbent and Eddie Marsan.Another thing to mention is the awesome soundtrack featuring Billy Ocean, an incredible cover of the song ""creep"" and lots of golden oldies, you'll be singing them for days after.All in all, a fantastically well executed film that will stay with you for days after. I strongly recommend this to anyone that doesn't mind a slightly grittier watch (maybe not appropriate for a date). And don't let the title or the content put you off, yes, it is rough at times but its also laugh out loud funny, well acted and perhaps in its own way a little piece of art.

Another piece of awesome acting is delivered by Jim Broadbent who plays his psychologist. The dialogues between him and James McAvoy are just amazing! The rest of the cast is also decent and the characters are all very special in a refreshing way. The only bad thing i can mention about this movie is, that it has some (but small) longueurs.

I think the casting is brilliant and I have a new found respect for James McAvoy, who in previous films I have found to be almost nondescript. He shines here, brighter than most Oscar winning performers I've seen. Ray Donovan's Eddie Marson is also fantastic in his role, so well cast - he's funny and warm in such a subtle way. This is not one of those situations when someone can rightly say 'the book is better' - I think the job has been done so well of adapting it into film format that the book is not better at all, just a different experience.

It's gritty and sharp right from the word go and embraces it's cast like some kind of toxic fog. Politically incorrect at every opportunity this movie will have you rolling about the floor of the cinema one minute, watching through clenched fingers and flinching at the sheer vulgarity the next.I absolutely loved it and I'm confident everyone in the cinema did. When the movie finished there was almost a unified cerebral silence as people tried to make sense of what they had just witnessed. I for one was unusually silent to such an extent that my wife thought I had suffered a mini stroke or something.Brilliant throughout with an excellent cast and some exceptional atmosphere. Make sure you can go for a beer or two after-wards, you will definitely need a drink...",Filth
159,jrymer-870-980723,How Does This Film Have So Many Fans?,5,3 February 2014,"It is just seriously so bad.It banked on overly cliché corrupt cop banter, and forwent any sort of reasonable plot.I didn't even pay to see it and I was disappointed. Total waste of bandwidth.Terrible.Boo.I'd rather watch Ender's Game again than suffer through even 5 more minutes of Filth, and I thought Ender's Game was certain to make my least favorite film of 2013.",Filth
160,johny_r,"Watchable, fun movie, but not for everyone",6,22 January 2014,"I thought it a well-portrayed roller coaster combination of mental sickness, sex, drugs, betrayal, and more brought to the screen in a vivid and entertaining, often surreal show.Of course if you can't relate to any of this type of subject matter, and would rather not delve in to the mind of a sicko, shedding light on the twisted journey some find themselves on, then you might be just wasting your time.Maybe yours is a gloriously perfect life. For others there will probably be a glimpse of something to poke at your self and laugh at, especially with all the fine characters in this flick.",Filth
161,one_among_many,Best acting from James McAvoy I have seen.,8,26 January 2014,"I was interested in seeing something that would remind me of Trainspotting. This may not be as comparable as I might have thought before watching it but this is one satisfied viewer. Best movie I have seen James McAvoy in. This movie was a roller coaster of depravity, debauchery, sadness, pity, anger and insanity. James McAvoy showcases his range in a twisted reluctant decent into human misery fuelled by drugs, alcohol, sex, anger and violence (just the right amount). I enjoyed the plot as it is non linear and multi-layered. Combine that with acting that can navigate through these layers and you got yourself a very decent movie. This movie exposes the unseemly underbelly of the individual in society. Despite all the weird and wacky things happening the director manages to find and maintain an impressive balance. The viewer will likely experience a range of emotions when watching this film. This movie will not be for everyone. It is in your face and unapologetic.",Filth
162,aadams9692,Pure Irvine Welsh,10,27 January 2014,"Like watching a Peter Howson painting brought to life, Irvine Welsh takes me on a voyage of laughs and tears as only he could. Addressing Scottishness, misogyny, bigamy, sectarianism, drugs and depression this film is a worthy follower to Trainspotting and should strike a chord with Scottish attitudes if not just to the police in ScotlandMost moving and entertaining with a cast of recognizable figures from Scottish media such as Braveheart, Bob Servant and others making an appearance this film should gain more recognition for quality and depth of observation.As a worthy follower to Irvine Welsh's Trainspotting viewers should expect the same honesty and realism.",Filth
163,user-972-672237,They said it couldn't be done...,7,13 April 2014,"They said the book couldn't be made into a film, and in a sense they were right. Despite it's 'sugar coated' climax (and I use that term with tongue firmly placed in cheek), Filth is living proof that the low-budget film industry is very much alive and kicking, and that some studios are still prepared to take the odd risk here and there - and thankfully they did with this.It's got its flaws, granted - but if this isn't a cult classic waiting in the wings, then it's at very least an abject lesson in how to make the impossible, possible. If you want something to watch after a weekend of debauchery, this is it.",Filth
164,pkingduckley,Crap!,1,31 August 2014,"This is an hour and a half of your life you will never get back--don't do it! McAvoy is a terrific actor; why he wasted his talent on this piece of shite is beyond me. How anyone can call it comedy is beyond me. How anyone can call it entertainment is beyond me. Sick, sad, and pathetic are the descriptors that come to mind. I have a good ear for languages and accents, and I lived in the U.K. for years, so a Scottish brogue is not unfamiliar to me. But the spoken words in this movie are sometimes unintelligible. Not that you miss any great dialogue, mind you! Based on the cast I decided to slog through it, ever hopeful it would have some redeeming aspect. Nope. Forget it. You'll be as sorry as this movie is.",Filth
165,donelado,Modern Cinema Masterpiece!,10,17 December 2014,"I never believed that filth would be anything more than a stupid controversial dark comedy.My friends were begging me to see this and i gave it a chance and let me tell you , I WAS DEAD WRONG.This movie really surprised me , the acting was master class especially from James McAvoy , the directing was revolutionary and some times it was similar to movies like snatch , trainspotting and two smoking barrels.But the storyline was the greatest surprise of all.You follow Bruce Robertson in his emotional and physical journey to the inspector promotion to win his wife and daughter back.And for a known plot , this movie outdoes it self.Let me tell you that you wont be able even to try to guess what will happen in this movie and i wont say anything cause i don't wont to spoil anything.Also the soundtrack was freaking Brilliant.The supporting cast was also well developed with great performances from Eddie marsan(so underrated actor) Jamie bell and Jim broadbent.This must be the most underrated movie of the recent 15 years.This movie is a MUST SEE for every cinema fan.Not only underrated BUT COMPLETELY MISUNDERSTOOD.",Filth
166,kikimonkey,Touching.,7,2 October 2016,"A man's descent into a drink and drug induced madness and paranoia. Not comfortable viewing and surreal at times. Ironically, the outtakes are some of the scenes that really ought to have been left in, because they are the most touching. A decent adaptation of a truly great book, but as with any adaptation of one of Welsh's novels, it has it's limitations. Each character is played convincingly, a little too convincingly sometimes, but it all comes to bear. The question remains: can a police officer, who is so ravaged by the constant hangovers and come-downs of booze and pills, really find it within himself to apprehend the murderer of a foreign student when the world around him - both physically and mentally - is falling apart?",Filth

168,bezushchak,Definitely worth seeing!,9,17 April 2017,"McAvoy one of the best for me! His roles as being psychopath are quietly brilliant! Just observe his mimics, his emotions, his intonation and stuff. It is the most difficult to be a ""bad-boy"", or ""a mad one"", as far as I am concerned. I've seen it many times, and every time there appears to be smth that I missed. That's the stuff I like the most about movies. And, obviously, that's why I prefer some philosophical ones to see, because every time you see, you have different interpretation in your head, and you notice more details, get more jokes and stuff. If you have enough time, I DO advice you such types of movies. they are aaawesome!",Filth
169,dank_raziel,"A corrupt, manipulative, junkie and mentally disturbed police detective goes as far as possible to get a promotion.",10,2 April 2017,"I absolutely loved this film, it was unexpected, gross, violent yet it had an incredible charm, specially to people who like very intense, deep emotions and that like to emotionally merge with a character. What I didn't like is that the summary (and also other websites) wrote about Bruce having BPD (borderline personality disorder) which I think is completely wrong because there's no part in the movie that says so and because he clearly displays bipolar, sociopath and even schizophrenia traits. As a BPD clinical diagnosed person I strongly believe the Borderline mention is wrong.",Filth
170,samo-registracije,what did just happen??,3,10 January 2015,"McAvoy was brilliant, you have to give him that. He played that twisted man brilliantly. As for the rest of the movie? What the hell is it about? The endless fall of a twisted mind? Endless fall of the twisted society?Saw no point in the movie or in the plot. If the point was to point out to a humanity in crisis... well, thank you, but we all knew that one already. Only thing funny, maybe, is to see how the coppers in Scotland are doing it, only, of course, bloated and exaggerated to the point of a pure comedy as seen in the beginning of the movie.All in all, I could have wasted my time a bit better.",Filth
171,lau_1983,Crazy,9,26 November 2017,I have just watched this film and literally couldn't take my eyes off of this film. Just had me hooked.James McAvoy is splendid (as always) and I'm surprised the film doesn't have a higher rating to be honest. The first half an hour was quite full on but stick with it. The film is full of strange scenes and unexpected twists and turns. Enjoy,Filth
