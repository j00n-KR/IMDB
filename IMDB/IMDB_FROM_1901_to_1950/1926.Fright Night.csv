0,TheLittleSongbird,Not as fangtastic as I would've liked...,6,17 September 2011,"That is not to say this Fright Night is terrible. It is not, in fact it is watchable, it's just that it didn't ignite my fire as much as the original Fright Night(an 80s classic) did. As far as remakes go, Fright Night is somewhere in the middle, not amazing like The Thing or The Thief of Baghdad but not abominations like Psycho or The Wicker Man. Starting with what was good, it is very well made, I'd say it is somewhat slicker than the original in terms of effects and how it was edited. The music is also great and very memorable as well as successfully enhancing each scene. The direction shows moments of imagination too particularly in the impressive gory moments, and the acting from David Tennant, Imogen Poots and especially Colin Farrell was excellent. However, there are two weaknesses, Anton Yelchin who was likable enough but bland and Christopher Mintz-Plasse who was really quite awful. The story is not as well paced, and seemed drawn out to me with some awkward scenes such as towards the end with the mother, while the script has the odd witty moment but lacks bite, fun and could've done with being more creepy too. The characters aren't as well written or as incorporated either, some of the relationships also felt rushed and forced. All in all though, definitely not bad or pointless, just didn't entirely satisfy me. 6/10 Bethany Cox",Fright Night
1,Leofwine_draca,Great way to destroy everything good about the original,2,23 March 2015,"The original FRIGHT NIGHT is a fun '80s popcorn flick, ably mixing comedy and horror like the best of '80s genre fare. This 2011 remake is so lame, so predictable, so forgettable in every respect that I wish I hadn't bothered watching it. The plot sticks EXTREMELY closely to the original film, so it's asking for comparisons. But the script for this one is dumb in the extreme: we're saddled with a scriptwriter who seems to think that swearing is funny and that dumb humour is the order of the day. Hell, we're stuck with Christopher Mintz-Plasse in it, for God's sake! Needless to say this is a failure in every respect, with every action scene, every scenario, every fight, well telegraphed in advance. I turned around at the outset and said ""wait for the CGI explosions and people being thrown around"" and sure enough all of these things happened as I predicted. About the best thing in it is the Chris Sarandon cameo, that lasts about 30 seconds.This has one of the worst casts I can think of. Colin Farrell's heart simply isn't in it, and he makes no effort to be imposing. Anton Yelchin is a charisma-free hero and the less I see of Toni Collette, playing his mother, the better. Imogen Poots is as lovely as ever but has little to do here other than look pretty, and the less said about David Tennant's cringe-worthy, Russell Brand wannabe the better. The FRIGHT NIGHT remake is only worth watching if you enjoy rubbishy CGI vampires over the remarkable prosthetics effects of the original.",Fright Night
2,SnoopyStyle,Pretty good vampire movie,7,15 September 2013,"Charley Brewster (Anton Yelchin) lives with his mom (Toni Collette) in a isolated suburb in the desert. He's a teen on the rise. When Ed (Christopher Mintz-Plasse) a dorky friend from his past comes to Charley to find another friend who's gone missing, he is unimpressed. When Ed himself disappears, he starts to suspect his new neighbor Jerry Dandrige (David Farrell) is a vampire. Peter Vincent (David Tennant) is a self proclaimed vampire killer and Las Vegas magician. Amy (Imogen Poots) is Charley's girlfriend.This is a remake of the 1985 original. There are a couple of differences from the original. Some improved the movie, others not so much. Colin Farrell is revealed too soon as the vampire. Supporters would say that it was always a given. But I would say that they got to go thru the motion. Anton Yelchin's character is a little unlikeable. The whole conflict with his former friends really distracted from the main issue, and drag the story down. The first half started slow. But Colin Farrell is a pretty good vampire. What's also missing is the Rear Window aspect of the original. The 2nd half pace started to pick up. The 360 car chase is quite interesting. At least it's not the same old car chase. It's not necessarily better than the original. It's just different.",Fright Night
3,claudio_carvalho,Awful Remake of the 1985 New-Classic,1,14 January 2012,"The Tom Holland's 1985 ""Fright Night"" is one of the most charming films of the cinema history. The story is funny and the humor is witty, with the handsome Chris Sarandon performing one of his best roles and William Ragsdale, Amanda Bearse and specially Roddy McDowall hilarious. In summary, the 1985 original film may be considered a new classic, worshiped by a legion of fans.This teen remake is simply awful, with explosions, car chase and a cynical and charmless Colin Farrell in the role of Jerry Danridge. People who have positively voted in this garbage have certainly not watched the original film. My vote is one (awful).Title (Brazil): ""A Hora do Espanto"" (""The Fright Hour"")",Fright Night
4,kosmasp,Don't be afraid of the Remake,8,24 January 2012,"Many of the moviegoers have grown tired of Remakes, just recycling old movies instead of coming up with something new, that actually is good too. But this movie shows us, that Remakes don't have to be awful. It also shows us, that a remake does not have to copy the original movie 1:1! While I still would recommend you to watch the original Fright Night first (I haven't seen the sequel it spawned), I can also tell you that a few things have been changed around here, so that watching this can be fun too.And while Chris Sarandon seemed to own his role in the Original, Colin Farell does a great job with the character in this too. He is obviously enjoying this and why shouldn't he? This is how a fun, light Hollywood Remake can look like ...",Fright Night
5,gavin6942,Could Have Been a Contender,6,23 April 2013,"A teenager (Anton Yelchin) suspects that his new neighbor (Colin Farrell) is a vampire.I had fond memories of the original ""Fright Night"", and then I watched it again in preparation of seeing the remake. While it is hard to beat Chris Sarandon and Roddy McDowall, I have to admit the original is not a perfect film. The running time is a bit long, the clothes are a bit dated... and none of the characters (besides Peter Vincent) is particularly likable.This remake had the opportunity to improve on those deficiencies, and in some ways it did. The action is stepped up, the body count is greater. Although this film was very much a product of 2011, I do not suspect it will age as poorly. And I have to give them credit for putting a new twist on Vincent and other aspects while more or less keeping the plot the same (and a nice homage to the original here and there).But there are new shortcomings -- the atrocious special effects here cannot compete with the practical effects of the original. Computer-generated effects are often inferior, but this film takes ""inferior"" to new depths. The people at the SyFy channel have produced work on this level. There is also less of a plot -- they managed to keep the length of the film the same, but removed the development that would have been nice.In short, while I think this film is alright and certainly not among the worst remakes out there (having McLovin in the cast really helped), it fell short of the potential it had. From a strong opening to a downward sloping story... it just never delivers.",Fright Night
6,jboothmillard,Fright Night,5,22 February 2012,"The original 1985 version of this film is fantastic for being a new spin on the vampire scary movie, and adding some funny moments into it as well, I was surprised to see that it would be getting a remake, but I tried it. Basically it follows pretty much the same storyline as the original, Charley Brewster (Star Trek's Anton Yelchin) suspects his new neighbour Jerry Danridge (Colin Farrell) is a vampire, especially with a string of mysterious murders that have happened in the area. With the help of his 'Evil' Ed Thompson (Superbad's Christopher Mintz-Plasse) he does indeed confirm this, and with his friend under the villain's influence Charley is doing everything he can to protect himself from danger, using garlic, crucifixes and holy water. Jerry's threat is becoming more obvious, so Charley goes to get help from the man on TV he has seen supposedly defeating dark creatures of the night, Vegas magician and supposed vampire expert Peter Vincent (David Tennant), of course he does not believe his story. Charley's mother Jane (Toni Collette) and girlfriend Amy Peterson (Imogen Poots) do not believe him either, but there is a night when Jerry really lets out his terror, attempting to kill them and trapping them in the car, and they barely escape. Eventually Peter is convinced that the dark creatures indeed exist, after helping kill the vampire turned Evil Ed, and he agrees to help the situation he can, especially as Amy has been kidnapped. Charley and Peter go into the house of the vampire, and are surrounded by the many turned female vampires, but they use the sunlight outside to their advantage, and in the end, a stake through the heart defeats Jerry and turns all turned victims, including Amy, back to normal. Also starring Dave Franco as Mark and original star Chris Sarandon as Jay Dee. Yelchin is a bit dull most of the time, Farrell does an alright job being the sinister vampire living next door, but isn't as darkly charismatic as Sarandon was, and Tennant is likable as the potty-mouthed vampire hunter, but he can't compare to the lovable Roddy McDowall. There are some noticeable changes to this version, for example the building up to a battle isn't there, the vampire turns brutal much earlier, and it is trying to be more scary and gory than accompany the scary elements with laughs, the original is much more enjoyable, but I guess this in an alright horror comedy remake. Worth watching, at least once, in my opinion!",Fright Night
7,BA_Harrison,Surprisingly enjoyable.,8,10 December 2011,"It's hard to take when Hollywood begins to remake all of the films that you first enjoyed as a teenager: not only does it make you feel very old (""They can't do that!!! It's only been **pause to count** 25 years since it came out""), but more often than not, they make a real mess of it.When I initially clapped eyes on stills of David Tennant looking like a total douche as Peter Vincent in this update of Fright Night, I prepared myself for the worst—'Here we go again', I thought to myself, 'another botch job in the works.' To my surprise, however, this one succeeds where most have failed; a few minor niggles regarding certain plot details aside (is picking a lock really that easy?), they've managed to take a well-loved 80s classic, bring it slam-bang up-to-date, make some neat tweaks to the story-line, while still maintaining everything that made the original such a blast.Fright Night (2011) is funny, scary, sexy, and cool, packed with dazzling special effects, and Tennant is actually very good, his character deliberately intended as an arrogant prick. The rest of the actors are also excellent, comparing favourably with the original's top notch cast: Anton Yelchin is suitably affable as Charley Brewster; Christopher Mintz-Plasse oozes nerd (although his Ed isn't quite as pathetic as Stephen Geoffrey's); Imogen Poots is incredibly sexy as Amy; and Colin Farrell makes for a very convincing Jerry, perfectly nailing both charming and chilling. Chris Sarandon, the original Fright Night's vamp, even turns up for a cameo.In a perfect world, I'd like this film to have had an updated version of the 80s soundtrack, performed by new bands—for me, the rock/pop music was an integral part of what made Fright Night so special; I'd also like to have seen the vampire as a bat, as in the original film, and for the effects to be a little less reliant on CGI. But when so many remakes aren't even worth investing the time, let alone hard earned cash, I'll just have to be satisfied that this one is as good as it is.",Fright Night
8,paul_haakonsen,"A remake that was worth watching, for a change...",6,26 November 2011,"Initially I had some restrictions against watching this movie, as I was rather fond of the original, plus Hollywood remakes of older movies tend not be worthwhile watching.However, this 2011 remake of ""Fright Night"" was actually surprisingly nice. It held true to the original movie, but still went one step beyond, instead of just being an updated frame-by-frame remodeling. This version was everything the old movie was and then some.The cast in the movie was actually quite good. One of the initial reservations I had against the movie was Colin Farrell (playing Jerry the vampire), but hand on heart, then he was actually amazing in this role. It was like he was tailor-made for this particular role and he did a great job. Now, I am not saying that Anton Yelchin (playing Charlie) was bad, far from it, but I enjoyed William Ragsdale (playing Charlie in the 1985 version) better. In this 2011 version they totally set up a whole new Peter Vincent (played by David Tennant), though I preferred Roddy McDowall who played Vincent in the 1985 version. There was just something more fun and charming over him. However, the way that the 2011 Peter Vincent was portrayed was good, especially with his background story.There was one really, really cool scene in the movie. And without saying too much, then I will say that fans of the 1985 version will get a kick out of seeing Chris Sarandon making a return to the movie.The effects in the movie were great, and the vampires did look nice too.""Fright Night"" (2011) is a movie that can be thoroughly enjoyed by movie watchers both familiar with the old ""Fright Night"" movies and new-comers to the series as well. Lots of action, good effects and a great story. And it is also nice if you are tired of watching vampires with sparkling skin and sickening large hair styles.I was thoroughly entertained and I think for a remake, then they actually took the 1985 version and gave it a very nice boost in the right direction. So thumbs up for this remake. Finally a Hollywood remake that was worth watching.",Fright Night
9,Quinoa1984,"like the original, not without flaws but with a stupendous cast and sense of fun",7,6 July 2016,"At the time it came out, a remake of Fright Night seemed like one of those unnecessary movies - what was so wrong with the Tom Holland original, which gave us a subtle/over-the-top performance from Chris Sarandon and some cheeky humor from Roddy McDowell as a vampire named Jerry and the would-be 'celebrity' vampire hunter? Did it need an update? But upon the sudden and to put it mildly tragic death of Anton Yelchin, I thought it was certainly time to watch it. And among a cast that features really major talents like Colin Farrell, David Tennant and Toni Collette, Yelchin holds his own. More than that, he is necessary for the movie to work: he has to be believable as a young guy who starts off somewhat unsympathetic (trying to be 'cool' by ditching his nerdy friend for an attractive girl), and over the course of the story has to man up and not do what his dad did, which was ditch the family behind.Yelchin plays the 'straight man' to a point where we can find him believable as being both completely scared and yet ballsy enough to go for what he has to go through to save and protect the ones he cares about - his mother and then, when she's taken by this 'Jerry' fella, Amy - and it's interesting to see this *after* Green Room, where he played a somewhat similar character though in a different setting (actually substitute Nazis for vampires and you got a somewhat similar premise, with Yelchin as the vulnerable but strong-willed and tough protagonist). If you've ever liked this actors work, this is a must-see of his.Looking at 2011 Fright Night on its own terms, outside of viewing it as some kind of after the fact thing for Yelchin, it's... good. Better than expected, really, as far as these kind of remakes can go (in other hands it could be easily disposable trash like Sorority Row or something). With Yelchin there as the main core for the audience to put their 'what would I do if' perspective on, Farrell and, in the second half of the film, Tennant get to have the time of their lives in these roles. Farrell is so evil he even eats an apple to show off how much of a nasty fella he is! Though it may not possibly require, shall one say, 'range', it takes real screen presence and a sense of menace, and I think Farrell makes this a memorable vampire as far as a) sex appeal (I mean, women and some men wouldn't kick him out of bed), and b) when he gets nasty and violent, the threat feels real. For Tennant, it's not a complicated character either - a fraud of a ""vampire hunter"" who is mostly for Las Vegas show - but he also gets to have fun in the role and can deliver exposition that is not in the least boring or distracting. And Toni Collette is... Toni Collette, good in all of her scenes. Even McLovin' and Dave Franco give some good supporting turns, turning cliché parts into something with personality.At any rate these characters are put into a setting that is rather novel: having it in/around Las Vegas makes it so that it's believable that people would be out and about largely at night, being the primary time vampires get their food. I liked seeing that and that it was used to good effect. Where the movie loses me most is in certain parts of the execution of the action. I don't know if it's because I'm tired of wasteful or lackluster CGI, but any time Farrell or any of the other vampires ""Fully turn"" (which doesn't seem to have a lot of logic, it only seems to occur when they're extra mad) it looks really bad and fake, and a particular over the top car chase, which is attempted in part in one ""long"" take ala Spielberg's War of the Worlds (no coincidence I think it's a Dreamworks production, the setting and lack of/absentee father seem like Spielberg notes). Practical effects could have taken more time or been more intensive, but the results would last longer and not take one out of the movie like here.If one can look at the substance of Fright Night it does work - the screenplay comes from Buffy the Vampire Slayer creative Marti Noxon, and the sense of whip-smart timing in the dialog and come-backs about how people look at vampires is especially funny, even from Peter Vincent most of all - and is a fitting tribute to the original. That film had a little more deadpan wit due to McDowell as Peter Vincent, though it too had some dated things as well (maybe in a cool way) like 80's synth music. Will this hold up so well? I don't know. But for what it is, it's entertaining and successful for being bloody (it looks as if the blood is not all CGI which is good) and knowing of the genre (it's self-conscious of vampire lore and movies, but it doesn't wear you out on it like the other 2011 post-modern horror, Scre4m)",Fright Night
10,BandSAboutMovies,Like some kind of horrible mistake,3,28 October 2018,"Colin Farrell plays Jerry here as ""the shark from Jaws."" Christopher Mintz-Plasse plays Evil Ed as a geeky kid who was once best friends with Charley, who is now one of the popular high schools (remind me to tell you about the child vampire that used to chase me through my grandparent's backyard someday). And former Dr. Who David Tennant is more Criss Angel than Zacherley.This is a film that I really tried to get past and enjoy, but I just couldn't be entertained by it. I'm not the only one. Tom Holland said, ""Kudos to them on every level for their professionalism, but they forgot the humor and the heart. They should have called it something other than Fright Night, because it had no more than a passing resemblance to the original. What they did to Jerry Dandrige and Peter Vincent was criminal. Outside of that, it was wonderful.""That said, there is a nice moment where Chris Sarandon makes a cameo as a victim of the new Jerry. Otherwise, this one is mean-spirited where it should have heart. No part of it feels fun. I was shocked to learn that it was directed by the same person who made I, Tonya and Lars and the Real Girl, Craig Gillespie.",Fright Night
11,Coventry,Viva Vampire Vegas,5,23 November 2014,"I patiently waited for ""Fright Night"" to come on TV so I could watch it for free, because I didn't have any expectations or prejudices whatsoever towards this film. I very much enjoyed Tom Holland's 1985 original and reckon its modest cult-horror reputation, but not so much to proclaim that a remake is totally redundant and/or blasphemous. The remake is definitely also enjoyable, though only while it lasts and I sincerely doubt it'll ever be considered as a genre gem, and finds a good balance between light-headed comedy and nowadays 3D-horror with grotesque blood splattering and over-the-top CGI effects. The plot and story structure largely remained the same as in the original but there are a couple of ingenious small changes, like the clever Las Vegas suburb setting. The protagonist is still Charley Brewster, a teenager undergoing a transformation from nerd into cool kid, who slowly learns that his playboy-like new neighbor is a vampire. The neighborhood where Charley lives with his mother is ideal turf for vampires, since it's close to Las Vegas and thus a lot of residents work night shifts and sleep during the day. When Charley's former best friend Ed disappears as well, like several other residents, it's up to him to convince his skeptic mother and girlfriend that the hunky and muscled Jerry from next door is – in fact – a monstrous bloodsucker. He seeks help from the famous vampire hunter on TV, Peter Vincent, but he initially turns out to be a phony and cowardly showman. The first half of ""Fright Night"" is rather tame but then abruptly turns into an uncompromising splatter fest. As an old-fashioned horror fanatic, I still hate digital & CGI effects, but I think I've grown immune to them and they don't bother me that much anymore. Still, the lousy computer effects are mainly the reason why ""Fright Night"" isn't the least bit suspenseful or atmospheric. The acting performances are good, with Colin Farrell clearly enjoying his role as modern vampire and the Scottish actor David Tennant stealing the show as Peter Vincent. The younger cast members are good too (particularly Christopher Mintz- Plasse and Imogen Poots) and there's a lovely guest appearance from Chris Sarandon; the bloodsucker in the original ""Fright Night"".",Fright Night
12,hitchcockthelegend,Well security is a little lax since everybody got their throat torn out.,7,1 July 2012,"Fright Night is directed by Craig Gillespie and written by Tom Holland. It stars Anton Yelchin, Colin Farrell, David Tennant, Christopher Mintz-Plasse, Imogen Poots and Toni Collette. Music is by Ramin Djawadi and cinematography by Javier Aguirresarobe. Film is a remake of the 1985 film of the same name, also written by Tom Holland, it sees Yelchin as Charley Brewster, a teenager living in a suburb of Las Vegas who finds the new handsome neighbour, Jerry Dandridge (Farrell) is actually a blood sucking vampire. With nobody believing him and the vampire homing in on his mother and girlfriend, Charley turns to enigmatic playboy magician Peter Vincent (Tennant) for help.Ah remakes, a word that often spells trouble in film fan circles, especially when populated by the horror faithful. So no surprise, then, that Fright Night has been met with much division whilst hardly making waves at the box office (it made a small profit when various costs were taken off the gross). Yet it did receive some favourable reviews in critic's offices, where like myself they feel that this more than lives up to the original, which was fun and scary but hardly what you call a horror comedy masterpiece. I often have my rose tinted spectacles on for the likes of the 85 Fright Night, but whether we choose to accept it or not, they were real fun films back then, but that was because they were viewed through younger eyes. Now when viewing in the haze of nostalgia, it's not hard to see why some modern film makers feel a remake is possible and can work; Fright Night is one such case.This is no masterpiece either, it drags for the first third and the CG malarkey really doesn't offer anything particularly worthy to the film's substance. In fact the transformation sequences are quite frankly weak. You don't have to be a nostalgist to lament the absence of a Bottin or Baker. But for all its little missteps, it still rounds out as great fun and scores high in the last third with the well blended mix of comedy, suspense and terror. The dialogue, too, is very enjoyable, with many lines bringing the chuckles. The casting is very good, particularly with the core three characters of Charley, Jerry and Peter. It's great to see Farrell having such fun, free of emotional character restraints, he just lets rip with a sexy and vengeful performance. Yelchin is just so likable, a rising blockbuster star after turns in Star Trek and Terminator Salvation (he would sadly be killed in a freak accident in 2016), here he crafts top work as Charley shifts from geeky teen into babe magnet bravado. While Tennant slots in and steals the movie with a glorious excess of profanity, sexuality and witticisms that befit the nature of the piece.Next up Farrell went serious and threatened to run the wrath of sci-fi fans with his star turn in the Total Recall remake. Here he comes out of this horror remake, like the film in general, with good credit. So those 80s teens like me should shake off the dust and strap themselves in to a seat for this particular ride. It may not surpass the original, but it is every bit its modern equal, and that is something that newcomers to the Fright Night world should hopefully rejoice in. 7/10",Fright Night
13,Doylenf,"Poor remake lacks the ""bite"" of the original...CGI is at its worst...",5,28 December 2011,"FRIGHT NIGHT has two saving graces: Anton Yelchin, who plays Charlie Brewster with the right mix of humor and a good grip on his character, and David Tennant who plays the TV vampire destroyer with a good deal of cultivated arrogance and outlandish attitudes.Beyond these performances, the rest of the film is only mildly successful in the casting. Colin Farrell is a disappointment in the role that Chris Sarandon played to perfection as the original ""vampire next door"" type with a lot more sexual heat than Colin exhibits in an underplayed style. And even back in 1985, the special effects were a lot more horrifying than those employed here which represent CGI at its worst.But most of all, the entire script has made drastic changes in the story that ""for better or worse"" are strictly for the worse. Fans of the original film will hardly recognize what has been done to the story, much less the characters.However, Toni Collette as Brewster's mother and Imogen Poots as his pretty girl friend are excellent, given what material they have to work with, and Christopher Mintz-Plasse gets some comic relief from the Evil Ed character that he becomes after ""the bite."" In this case, his Evil Ed is much less effective than the one in the original film.So many of the key scenes are played in virtual darkness, making it impossible to see what is actually going on at important moments in the action sequences. This is way below standard for a horror film that is supposed to be scaring the audience realistically.Summing up: A waste of time and money. See the original and you'll understand why I lack enthusiasm for this remake which attempts to be stylish and cool and full of rough language.",Fright Night
14,preppy-3,Finally! Evil vampires are back!,8,21 August 2011,"Remake of the 1985 movie. Teenager Charley Brewster (Anton Yelchin) is suspicious of his new next door neighbor named Jerry (Colin Farrell). He finds out he's a vampire and is slowly killing all the teenagers in his small town near Las Vegas. He tries to enlist the help of magician Peter Vincent (David Tennant) who supposedly knows all about vampires.I usually hate remakes and was horrified (and not in a good way) when I heard this was being done. The 1985 film was a great mix of humor and horror and had two wonderful performances by Roddy McDowell (as Vincent) and Chris Sarandon (as Jerry). It was made to introduce the vampire to the MTV generation and it was a huge hit. I saw it twice up the theatres, owned the VHS AND now have the DVD! Obviously I wasn't going to see this. I thought it was a joke when I heard Farrell was going to play the vampire. He's a great actor but I just couldn't see him playing the role. It came out a few days ago and reviewers praised it to the high heavens. THAT made me curious (reviewers usually hate horror films). I went to see it and almost left when I found out that they only have it in 3-D and were charging the outrageous price of $15.50! But--I figured I was there so what the hell. I went in preparing to hate the film...and ended up LOVING it!It follows the plot of the original but makes a few changes. Jerry no longer has a human helper living with him; this takes place near Las Vegas not in a small town; the house in the original was large and delightfully creepy (not this one) and Charley's girlfriend is NOT a reincarnation of the vampire's ex-girlfriend from long ago (a plot point that I'm glad they got rid of). This one retains most of the set pieces from the original but changes them in various ways. I also love how they recreate a scene from the original novel ""Dracula"" here. However they do add plenty of scenes that were not in the original. There's a car chase down a highway here that's downright terrifying. It's not all scares though. Like the first there is some intentional and funny humor (they take a swipe at the revolting ""Twilight"" series early on). The special effects are superb all the way through. LOVED the scene where u see Farrell turn swiftly from a vampire to a human. The film is somewhat bloody and gory but never overdoes it. The acting is pretty good. Yelchin is likable as Charley and Imogen Poots (as his girlfriend Amy) is OK. I never liked David Tennant but I do admit he was OK as Vincent--but he won't make you forget McDowell. Christopher Mintz-Plasse was just terrible as Ed (who was MUCH better in the original). Best of all is Farrell. I never thought he could do it but he plays the vampire beautifully. You see his bloodlust and anger just below the surface even when he's being friendly. Great music score too.Finally we have a movie about evil vampires instead of that nurtured ""Twilight"" crap which turns them into romantic anti-heroes. This is as good as the original but in different ways. I give it an 8. I hate to admit this but the 3-D was GREAT! It was never over or underused and really worked. Still $15.50 is way too much to pay.",Fright Night
15,zardoz-13,Something To Sink Your Fangs Into . . .,9,30 August 2011,"This splendid remake of the 1985 comedy chiller about a high school senior who suspects that his next door neighbor may be a vampire is funny, fast-paced, and suspenseful. ""Fright Night"" never wears out its welcome during its interesting 106 minutes, and the leads are sympathetic and charismatic, while the vampire villain is devious and crafty. Unlike the original, which was set in Iowa, the remake takes place in Las Vegas. Charlie Brewster (Anton Yelchin of ""The Beaver"") lives with his single mom, Jane Brewster (Toni Collette), who sells real estate, in a Vegas suburb. Anyhow, Charlie has suffered the slings and arrows of being a nerd for far too long in high school. Finally, he gets the chance to rub shoulders with the in-crowd. Charlie surprises his closest friends, Mark (Dave Franco of ""Superbad"") and Ben (Reid Ewing of ""The Truth Below""), when he attracted the attention of one of the most popular girls, Amy (Imogen Poots of ""V for Vendetta""), and they become an item.Meanwhile, several classmates are vanishing without a trace, and one of Charlie's old friends, Ed (Christopher Mintz-Piasse of ""Kick Ass""), struggles to persuade him that a vampire is on the prowl. Charlie and Ed were once geek buddies galore, but Charlie has shed that image and no longer wants to be associated with Ed. Ed threatens to publish several pictures of Charlie when they were into playing super heroic character in spandex outfits and uses this to force our protagonist to help him. Everything that Ed knows about vampires, he has obtained from famed vampire hunter and stage magician Peter Vincent (David Tennant of ""Dr. Who"" channeling Russell Brand) who has a Las Vegas lounge act. The next door neighbor, Jerry Dandridge (Colin Farrell of ""Horrible Bosses""), turns out to be the fangster. No, this is no surprise and the filmmakers do not hide it from audiences. Jerry has hidden rooms built into his house where he holds his prey hostage. Charlie inventories the contents of the house after Jerry steps out. Predictably, before Charlie can find everything, Jerry returns. Eventually, Charlie changes his mind about the existence of vampires and ends up visiting Peter Vincent. He masquerades as a Las Vegas Sun reporter to convince Vincent to share his knowledge with him about vampires.""Mr. Woodcock"" director Craig Gillespie maintains a fine balance between spoof and sobriety. Scenarist Marti Noxon deserves kudos for observing some vintage vampire rules. For example, a vampire cannot enter any house without an invitation. The scene when Charlie begins to doubt his skepticism about vampires occurs when Jerry tries to walk into his kitchen. Colin Farrell fares very well as a home repair kind of vampire who doesn't let anything get in his way when he wants something. The action resembles the action-thriller ""Disturbia"" and ""Disturbia"" drew some of its inspiration from the Alfred Hitchcock classic ""Rear Window."" The 3-D effects were above-average and things actually fly out from the screen. David Tennant is particularly good as the vampire hunter who regains confidence in himself. The finale when our hero dresses in a fireproof suit to destroy the vampire is clever.",Fright Night
16,ferguson-6,We miss you Roddy,6,22 August 2011,"Greetings again from the darkness. We can't really discuss this movie without referencing the 1985 original. Writer Tom Holland was involved with both (including directing the original) and gets credit for updating the story while maintaining the look and feel. It seems as if vampires are everywhere these days, but the Fright Night recipe expertly mixes suspense, danger and campy humor.Charley (Anton Yelchin) and his single Mom (Toni Collette) live in a quiet Las Vegas suburb. Charley's nerdy friend Ed (Christopher Mintz-Plasse) notices the place is getting quieter everyday ... people are disappearing! These disappearances correspond with the arrival of Charley's new neighbor Jerry (Colin Farrell). Yep ... Jerry the Vampire.Charley at first ignores Ed's investigative skills and concentrates on Amy (Imogen Poots), the out-of-his-league girlfriend whom he desperately wants to get to know better. And then ... Ed disappears. Charley tries to push Amy aside and solve this mystery. It doesn't take long since he breaks into Jerry's house and discovers where he stores the bodies of his victims. As you might expect, Jerry doesn't take well to the invasion.Charley goes to Vegas showman Peter Vincent (David Tenant) to seek help in destroying Jerry. See, Peter Vincent's crazy Vegas show is all about fighting the evil dead among us. Of course, Vincent isn't quite as tough off stage.There are plenty of moments of campy fun as Charley pursues Jerry. Not the least of which is a fender bender which includes Chris Sarandon, who played Jerry in the original. While it's a nice homage, it just made me miss Roddy McDowell, who originated the role of Peter Vincent. Still, watching McLovin as a tough-talking vampire is quite a bit of fun as are the few moments of doubt from Collette and Poots.Craig Gillespie directs the film, and his success a few years ago with the indie hit Lars and the Real Girl brings an added touch of class to the film. He really does a nice job of balancing the terror of the story with the humor necessary to make this one enjoyable and different.A tip of the cap to the casting of the movie. Yelchin (Star Trek, The Beaver) is a real up and comer. Ms. Poots was very effective in Jane Eyre and it will be interesting to follow the direction of her career. Collette is a real pro. Colin Farrell seems to really enjoy his turn as a vampire and adds some subtleties and quirks that make it fun. David Tenant (Dr. Who) really captures the Vegas Peter Vincent. Mintz-Plasse is one of the few who can effectively bounce from high school nerd to powerful vampire. Must also mention some hidden gems: singer Lisa Loeb makes a quick appearance as Ed's mother, Charley's friend Mark is played by Dave Franco - brother of James (you will spot the resemblance), and Peter Vincent's girlfriend Ginger is played by Sandra Vergara, sister of Sofia from Modern Family (again, you can't miss the resemblance).In this day and age, it isn't easy to assemble such a strong cast, script and director for a movie that isn't centered around alien action, terminal disease or toilet humor. If you enjoy campy horror films done with an acknowledged tongue planted in cheek, then I recommend this one. It delivers exactly what you hope and expect.",Fright Night
17,anaconda-40658,Not Bad but Fangs Aren't As Sharp As the Original.,7,3 September 2015,"Fright Night (2011): Dir: Craig Gillespie / Cast: Anton Yelchin, Colin Farrell, David Tennant, Imogen Poots, Christopher Mintz-Plasse: Remake of the awesome 1985 original that effectively exploited the vampire clichés. This version isn't as effective yet it gives it a worthy attempt. Anton Yelchin plays Charlie Brewster, a high school student who discovers that classmates are going missing. When his friend Evil Ed suddenly disappears after suspecting that Brewster's new neighbor is a vampire, he decides to investigate himself and discovers gruesome results. Unlike the original film, the characters of Charlie and Ed seem at different positions here in terms of being convinced of foul play. Yelchin will obviously have to face off with his vampire neighbor Jerry Dandridge but his investigation provides a few suspenseful moments. Colin Farrell plays Dandridge who lures young women into his house where the screams can be heard through Charlie's window. His tactic to lure Charlie out of his house is a nice new touch that results in a road chase. David Tennant plays a younger version of Peter Vincent but he brings comic touches to the theatre horror performer in a British Eric Idle kind of way. He is a louse and a celebrity of selfish means until Charlie seeks his help. Imogen Poots plays Charlie's girlfriend Amy who is struggling to gain commitment from him until she is targeted by Jerry. Christopher Mintz-Plasse plays Evil Ed quite opposite to Stephen Geoffrey's version. The ending is over the top but this is a well made remake to a film that made this particular night frightening to begin with. Score: 7 / 10",Fright Night
18,kannibalcorpsegrinder,Solid and enjoyable remake,9,18 April 2017,"After a mysterious stranger moves into his neighborhood, a teen and his friends accidentally stumble upon his terrifying secret about being a vampire and recruits a famous vampire hunter to try to stop the trail of carnage left behind and his friends become the next target.This was a surprisingly decent enough affair that wasn't really all that bad with some good points to it. Among the better parts here is the absolutely fun storyline throughout here that does compare favorably against the original since the ruse is discovered early on. This has a lot of rather fun antics that really push this along, from their initial meeting that clues him, the strange way he continually creeps around the neighborhood to pop up at exactly the wrong time or the few behavioral ticks that give him away which all go wrapped together alongside the previously-discovered videotapes that all help to give this one the work needed to fully reveal the ruse. Beyond this, the scenes stalking around the house where he has to free the captive inside and her eventual fate not only gives this one yet another charge for the ruse yet also features quite a really suspenseful sequence to help build that section more beyond the friendly scenes. There's a lot to come off of that in its action in here, from the house destruction and eventual high-speed chase along the highway that has a lot to like about it during their various chases and encounters with him to the battle in the office that includes some nice stalking scenes through the endless rows of artifacts stored away or battling the creatures in the panic room. As well, this here has the final assault on the underground hideout with all the turned victims providing enough of a battle to allow for some big action moments before the one-on-one confrontation, which is rather entertaining in its own right as there's some rather fun fighting here with their contraptions and some decent enough gore scenes to make it interesting. Along with the vampire makeup and gore, this is a pretty good effort with a lot to like although there are a few problematic elements here. The film's biggest flaw is the fact that the ruse is found out far too early and far too easily, since there's little investigation required to find out his true identity and it's all out in the open with such little push- back or need to look further into who he is which makes for some questionable storyline points. Along with this effort, the film also manages to stumble somewhat in it's CGI which is rather cheesy and clumsy throughout here as there are some exceptionally weak shots in here. The fact that so many of them are due to the wounds inflicted upon him which is quite obvious due to his spastic movements and disorienting behavior during the attacks, and along with the transformation scenes and use of blood and gore all just make for a rather flawed experience. These do knock it down somewhat but not enough to lower it overall.Rated R: Graphic Language and Graphic Violence.",Fright Night
19,FlashCallahan,you read too much Twilight......,8,4 September 2011,"Having only recently seen the original for the first time in twenty years, didn't ruin anything for me in this respectable remake.The fun thing about his film is that it gets to the point of the film almost immediately.Charlie is a high school kid who is convinced by his friend Ed that his next door neighbour Jerry, is a vampire. his friends go missing, and Jerry starts to sniff loudly a lot, then just smoulders for the rest of the film.In the meantime, he seeks help from Doctor Who, who is currently doing a Russell Brand sketch show in Vegas, as he is a renound Vampire hunter....The film isn't going to be for everyone, it carries the burden of being an Eighties horror remake, which always gets peoples backs up. But thank heavens for the setting, a strange little suburb in the middle of nowhere, where every house looks like the next one, makes it all the more eerie.Farrell does a great job as the vampire, but unfortunately, he isn't a patch on Sarandon, but he gets to kill him later in the film. Yelchin is surprisingly god as Charlie, and keeps on the right side of sissy, without being too wet.There are scenes which are lifted straight from the original, which are subtle, but good, and the lines taken from the original, just don't seem to have the same impact though.There is one very clever scene which involves Jerry not being invited into the house, and causing him to blow it up instead, probably the most original thing here.Platz is wasted as 'Evil' Ed though, and should have been given more screen time, but here, his character really needs fleshing out more.Tennant is hilarious as Vincent, and really adds a touch of something to the film, but a revelation between him and Jerry toward the end is never elaborated upon, and feels really rushed.3D is good in some places, but the dusk and night settings sometimes make it difficult to fathom out what is going on.So all in all, it's a great remake, don't be put off by the bad box office, this is worth seeing, and it doesn't disappoint as a standalone horror-comedy either.",Fright Night
20,Wuchakk,Different enough from the original...,7,28 October 2013,"...to make it worthwhile.The original ""Fright Night"" from 1985 was a fun horror film with a half-serious, half-campy vibe. Its strengths were a great story, an excellent (and hideous) vampire, Roddy McDowall as Peter Vincent and an entertaining air. There was a quasi-remake in 2008 called ""Never Cry Werewolf"", which (obviously) traded the vampire for a werewolf: it was a quality remake with the variation of a female protagonist (Nina Dobrev) and Kevin Sorbo in the McDowall role.This 2011 official remake features Colin Farrell as the vampire. It has the same plot, but there's enough variation in the details to make it a quality remake. Instead of the Los Angeles area (or an Eastern city in ""Never Cry Werewolf""), this one takes place in a small desert community outside Las Vegas (and was shot in Vegas and New Mexico). I can't say that Farrell is a better vampire than Chris Sarandon (or the werewolf in ""Never Cry Werewolf"", Peter Stebbings), but he's just as good in his own unique way, although the F/X aren't as good when the vampire morphs into its most hideous self.Anton Yelchin shines as the teen who is astonished to discover that a vampire is living next door. Seriously, Yelchin is a surprisingly excellent protagonist. Toni Collette as his mother and Imogen Poots as his girlfriend offer strong support. These three take the material seriously and are contrasted by Christopher Mintz-Plasse, who takes a campy approach, and Colin, who opts for lower camp like Sarandon in the original.The weak point of the original was Amanda Bearse (""Marcie"" from Married With Children). Don't get me wrong, she was her typical fun, likable self, but she didn't cut it as a hot female protagonist (then again, maybe the filmmakers weren't shooting for that). Poots, Collette and Sandra Vergara as Ginger -- Peter Vincent's babe -- deliver the goods here. However, David Tennant isn't anywhere near as strong in the McDowell (or Sorbo) role. Why? Because Peter Vincent in the remake is just a sad alcoholic who's hiding out as a Vegas entertainer, trying to drown out his grief. Tennant's fine in this role, but the character, as-written, isn't as strong.In any case, 2011's ""Fright Night"" is an entertaining horror flick. It's not actually scary due to the semi-goofiness, but it's very amusing and thrilling.The film runs 106 minutes.GRADE: B+",Fright Night
21,gradyharp,Silly,1,3 January 2012,"Confession: this viewer has not seen the original 1985 version of FRIGHT NIGHT and is not a fan of the interminable line of vampire movies that flood the screens year after year. So why watch FRIGHT NIGHT 2011? Seeing the names of fine actors such as Colin Farrell, Toni Colette, +/- Anton Yelchin suggested this might not be a bad movie if those actors committed to it. And perhaps it is partly due to the fact that lack of exposure to this genre creates the problem of deciding why some people find these films funny while other find them frightening. So, preface over. Given the virginal approach to this vampire film, this viewer finds it silly, poorly written, self indulgent - and an unexplainable waste to talent. Tom Holland is recycled by Marti Nixon and the updated Las Vegas suburb community form is handed to director Craig Gillespie. The 'plot' centers on the presence of one Jerry (Colin Farrell, subtle acting at first and then falls apart) as the resident vampire next door to Century 1 Realtor Jane Brewster (Toni Collette) and her nerdy son Charley (Anton Yelchin). Charley's equally nerdy friend Ed (Christopher Mintz-Plasse) is convinced that Jerry is a vampire and carries crosses and stakes etc in preparation for meeting him (an early taste treat for Jerry, Ed becomes a ridiculously distorted mad man). The two lads are mocked by fellow classmates Mark (Dave Franco, brother of James Franco) and Ben (Reid Ewing) and teased by the very beautiful Amy (Imogen Poots). Kids go missing and soon Charley becomes a believer and form there on out it is a detective game to rout out Jerry. Charley, once convinced that Jerry is indeed a vampire, seeks guidance from the alcoholic scare-showman Peter Vincent (David Tennant) who has secrets of his own. Of course it is evident that it will turn out just fine, but getting there (to the end) is a tedious bore. The musical score is by Ramin Djawadi and the cinematography (thankfully mostly in the after hours dark vampires so need) is by Javier Aguirresarobe.Perhaps this is funny to some and perhaps it is frightening to others: after all there is a faithful cult of addicts who run to the theaters whenever one of these vampire flicks is released.

22,zetes,Shockingly good!,8,18 December 2011,"A remake of the 1985 cult classic. Personally, I think the original film is just okay. This is a rare remake that really improves on its source material (in fact, I'd say a somewhat mediocre film like Fright Night '85 is about the perfect choice for a remake). Sure, it's not a perfect film, but it's well done. Anton Yelchin (who did fine in both Star Trek and Terminator Salvation playing Chekov and John Connor respectively) stars as a teenager who discovers his new neighbor (Colin Farrell, perfectly smooth) is a vampire. There's very little set-up in this version. It gets into the story right away, with Farrell, now exposed, immediately going after Yelchin. The film handles both the suspense and humor quite well. The cast is uniformly excellent. Imogen Poots (28 Weeks Later) is quite a beauty as Yelchin's girlfriend. Toni Collette plays Yelchin's mother. David Tennant has a scene-stealing role as a stage magician who's also an expert on vampires. Christopher Mintz-Plasse plays the nerdy buddy who gets turned by Farrell early on. My biggest complaint with the film is that Mintz-Plasse (McLovin from Superbad) is kind of wasted. He was a great choice for the role, and is a big improvement over the annoying Stephen Geoffreys from the original film. His relationship with Yelchin is set up quite well (they were best friends up until a year or so ago, when Yelchin started dating Poots and became popular), but there's no pay-off. Instead, Mintz-Plasse is kept off-screen for most of the movie and only re-enters for some goofy comic relief, which is entirely unnecessary since we have Tennant. I would also complain about some of the special effects. The CGI is fairly poor. But it's not a big part of the film.",Fright Night
23,trashgang,"good remake, even it's full of CGI",7,12 December 2011,"Tricky this is to see Colin Farrell as Jerry the vampire. On the other hand it is also a bit dangerous to remake another horror classic. Jokes back then did work but are out of order nowadays. I must say that the writers did ask Tom Holland (writer and director of Fright Night 1985)to be involved. And that was good thinking, remember how the Nightmare On Elm Street remake failed due their arrogance of not including old actors (Robert Englund)and director/writer (Wes Craven), you know what I mean. Still, Fright Night wasn't frightening at all, it was all a funny horror flick due the situations. Nice to see they did that again. You just can't take Fright Night serious even as it isn't a comedy. The story here is for most parts equal to the original one, they only updated the situations. By now people know that I have some fear towards the use of CGI. There's a bit here but I didn't had anything against it. The changing of the faces is exactly like the original one but its' done CGI this time. It's never really scary although it will have scene's that could be frightening for newcomers in the horror genre.The acting was something different. Colin was okay to see but still I had some doubts as him being in a horror flick. He has the face but sometimes his macho-thing stood in the way. Of course they made a reference to Twilight and I must say that this flick is a bit made for teenagers. I know that in the original one it's all about youngsters but here the overall look is really towards them. I would classify this flick on the shelve next to Red Riding Hood or Jennifer's Body. You know, it has it's blood and scary parts but it never got ugly or gory. But at the end of the day, I liked it because it had funny moments and delivered some enjoyable moments.

The actors played well and the effects were decent. The only issue with it: the script. Could have been better in the character development.

25,Smells_Like_Cheese,Fright Night's back!,7,24 August 2011,"Once again, Hollywood is running out ideas and it's Fright's Night's turn for the remake. Fright Night is a huge cult classic that I'm sure was expected to flop, instead turned into a pleasant surprise. It's a fun film that came out of the 80's and is a classic treasure; it's like Rear Window with vampires. I didn't see the film until a few years ago, not sure how I missed it, I guess The Lost Boys was my vampire film of the 80's. But I loved the film and its clever mix of horror and humor. Plus it has a great cast, fun effects and a cool story. To remake it, again, everyone gets upset at first but from the trailer the film actually looked pretty good. I saw this opening day looking forward to seeing a reboot and while it's certainly flawed, this is actually a pretty decent remake. Charley Brewster is a teenager who discovers he has a new neighbor moving in next door to him. Charley's geeky ex-friend, Ed, tells him that many fellow students have gone missing. Charley disregards this, but talks him into coming to an old friend's house to check if he's alright.When Charley goes home after school, his mother introduces him to Jerry, who is the new neighbor. Charley meets up with Ed who informs him that his new neighbor is a vampire, Charley doesn't believe Ed and leaves. On his way home Ed is confronted by Jerry who convinces him to become a vampire and bites him. The next day Charley realizes that Ed is missing and decides to go to his house to investigate. As Jerry begins to attack more people throughout the neighborhood, Charley goes into Jerry's house and finds out that he is keeping all of his victims in secret rooms. Charley decides to go to Las Vegas magician Peter Vincent, a supposed expert on vampires and hope to destroy Jerry before he gets to his mother and beautiful girlfriend. Colin Ferrel, what can I say? Who could have been a more perfect choice? After his stint in rehab, I'm sure he more than enjoyed getting back into playing the bad boy. His Jerry may not have the exact same charm as Chris Sarandon, but you can tell he had a lot of fun and brought a lot to the character. However I wasn't as excited on the choice for Charlie, Anton Yelchin, who was actually kind of boring in my opinion. You can tell he tries but I don't think he had the best lines to work with. Now David Tennant who replaces Roddy McDowall was actually a decent replacement almost like a Cris Angel character, but honestly, even if I get hate for this comment, I think I would have loved to see Russell Brand in this role if they were going for that direction.There are a few disappointments with the film like not having the same chemistry that the original Charlie and Peter had, it seems like their relationship is more rushed in the remake and not like they really belong together. Also, since the film does take itself seriously as if we are supposed to buy that this is happening in our real world, how is it that there is absolutely no police investigation when people are missing? I mean, they say that people pass through Vegas and are never heard from again, but an entire family is missing and nothing is questioned? Also I was upset with the lack of Ed, I loved the plot change with him, but we didn't have enough Ed which Christopher Mintz-Plasse plays pretty well. The script may need work however; I still had fun watching the action and special effects. Though I don't think that the 3D was exactly needed for the film, they stuck to the original look to the vampires which I'm glad they did. But please, no more Twilight references, let's just try to forget those books or movies ever existed. Before I end the comment since I'm running out of room here, doesn't the poster remind you of No Country for Old Men? Maybe it's just me no, it's not me, they copied the poster. But I enjoyed the film, I'm pretty sure those who loved the original will get a good kick out of the remake. Its fun, stylish, sexy and exactly the good time horror movie we needed this year.7/10",Fright Night
26,Hellmant,The 3D probably wasn't necessary and neither was remaking the 80's cult classic but it's still a good time at the movies!,8,23 August 2011,"'FRIGHT NIGHT': Four Stars (Out of Five)Another popular 80's horror film remake, this one cashing in on the popular vampire craze. I was a fan of the 1985 original (and own it on DVD) and not having any problems with remakes I welcome new variations on movies I enjoy. I was pretty pleased with this one. It is more of an action film than the original but it's still a lot of fun and just as entertaining in it's own right. It was directed by Craig Gillespie, who also directed one of my all time favorite films 'LARS AND THE REAL GIRL' (but he also did the disappointing stinker 'MR. WOODCOCK'). It was written by Marti Noxon, an experienced television writer and producer who also worked on similar themed shows like 'BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER' and 'ANGEL'. The film stars Anton Yelchin and Colin Farrell in the vampire role originated by Chris Sarandon (who has a cameo in the film). It is a different styled film than the original but I think that can be a good thing too and it definitely works here. Nerd Charley Brewster (Yelchin) is living his dream life; he's dating his dream girl, Amy (Imogen Poots), and is finally accepted by his other classmates at school. His old best friend, fellow nerd Ed (Christopher Mintz-Plasse), feels neglected and when he tries to warn Charley that he thinks his new neighbor Jerry (Farrell) is a vampire Charley ignores him. Then Ed turns up missing and Charley begins to freak out as it becomes more and more apparent that Jerry is in fact a real bloodsucking vampire. He soon realizes that he, Amy and his single mom Jane (Toni Collette; who's already worked with Gillespie on her show 'UNITED STATES OF TARA', which he's guest directed multiple times) are in grave danger. He tries to enlist the help of noted vampire expert and famous magician/TV personality Peter Vincent (David Tennant taking over the role that Roddy McDowall made famous; marking McDowall's second film franchise to be revived in as many weeks, following 'PLANET OF THE APES' two weeks ago). Vincent appears to be just a hack though, then things get really crazy.The film is action packed and full of witty dark humor. Gillespie's directing is right on target and the screenplay is smart. The performances are all more than efficient with Farrell making a truly threatening vampire villain (it almost has a little bit of a 'T2' feel to it at times with Farrell appearing like an invincible T-1000 machine). Yelchin once again proves he's a talented up and coming actor, Collette is once again good in the mom role, Poots is hot, Tennant is hilarious and Mintz-Plasse is Mintz-Plasse. The look of the film is fittingly dark and gloomy. It's a little puzzling that the studio backing the film, Disney, decided to shoot it in 3D and then not market it that way (feeling it might hurt the box office and marking the first time a studio has downplayed 3D). It has been a little disappointing financially so far but due to it's low budget will undoubtedly make it's money back (and then some). The 3D probably wasn't necessary and neither was remaking the 80's cult classic but it's still a good time at the movies.

27,thesar-2,Sin City's Night & Frightless,2,12 December 2011,"Look, listen. I defend a lot of remakes, redo's and reimaging films. Most are actually bad, some are priceless. The best thing I could say about 2011's Fright Night is: At least it's better than the pointless and horrid 1989 sequel. Butnot by much.PLEASE don't watch this movie if you're a fan of the 1985 original. Or, softer: for those Fright Night virgins, watch the first movie even if this might still work on a miniscule level. The only thing this movie had in common with the first movie was: A> the title. B> The Character's Names and C> There's a vampire living next door.Those three qualities take about 1/1000th of the script. Fill in the blank with new, too serious material. I mean, the original was CAMP, pure and simple. A lot of comedy, some horror and fun. This one takes it too deadly serious, plus they added too much of the annoying ""CW"" atmosphere. That kiddie, 90210, trend is really starting to get on my nerves. It's not working for people my age, and according to the box office receipts, it's not working for the teen crowd either. So, Hollywood, please dump this idea of bringing back classic horror to the ""CW"" absent movie-goers.I haven't even got to the worse part of this movie: The reimagining of the great character, Peter Vincent, now played by a third-rate Russell Brand-Rip-off, David Tennant. He was absolutely awful. It would be in the same category as hiring Pauley Shore as James Bond. Of course, this is coming from some who loved the original Roddy McDowall version. But, besides that, for those who haven't even heard of the original, he was still incredibly lame.This also goes for the quickly-turned ""Evil Ed"" character. I do like Christopher Mintz-Plasse, but he's certainly no Stephen Geoffreys from the 1985 film.This movie's a mess. It had a great scene of the family being evicted by the neighbor vampire and their journey to the Las Vegas strip, but other than that, it's a complete waste of film. It took the original movie's idea (new neighbor is a vampire and kid-Charley Brewster must defend his girl and kill the monster with aid of vampire killer, Peter Vincent) to a new depth of boredom.

I actually saw it three times in theatre and I rarely ever see anything more than once in theatre...I loved it every single time. First of all if you have the opportunity to see this in 3D...this might be the only film I have ever seen where the 3D actually impressed me. It was fun and in your face and really brilliantly shot. I am not giving this a perfect score lightly...you would know from my other reviews I don't hand this out easily...Fright Night for me was simply perfectly entertaining. That doesn't make it a perfect film but I loved every single second of this and it will be a permanent favourite of mine. The story is fun, the one liners are hilarious, the characters are wild and crazy, and from beginning to end I loved it.Years ago I called Anton Yelchin one to watch and now his career is becoming something to really take notice of. He headlines this film with ease and humour and kick butt action and he is fantastic! I love this kid! He is a pro and he has some great roles ahead of him. I know a lot of people don't like Colin Farrell, mostly because of his personal life, but I think he can be a very versatile actor and while he doesn't blow away this film, he does a great job in his role. He's dark and twisted and a little campy and perfect. Him and Yelchin have great chemistry. Toni Collette adds a certain level of class to the cast in a role that isn't her usual indie subject matter. But she does a good job as the 'cool' mom to Yelchin's character. Imogen Poots is sort of the typical hot young teenie girlfriend to the main character but what I liked about her is that she actually had some substance and held her own on the cast. And finally but certainly not least Dr. Who fans will squeal for David Tennant in his role as the consummate Vampire expert Peter Vincent. I liked him a lot in the role but I couldn't help but thinking it would have just been a little entertaining if they had gotten someone bigger for the role...a surprise fun cameo...but I know Tennant definitely has his fans and he does a good job. Also worth checking out is Christopher Mintz-Plasse (McLovin') who is hilarious (although almost overused) as Ed/Evil Ed.Amazing special effects and terrific scenes make this a must see. Director Craig Gillespie comes from Television but I think he must be a horror fan or even an expert at thriller because the everything about Fright Night just works. The pace, the setting, the characters, just made one of the entertaining and fun films of the year. That's the important thing...FUN. I know people will read this and scoff and say how much they hated Fright Night but those are the same people that expected more than what you should from a movie like this. This movie is one of the best popcorn flicks I have seen in months. Please see this and have a great time!! 10/10",Fright Night
29,bowmanblue,Solid enough vampire yarn,7,22 February 2015,"I can't actually remember the original nineteen eighties Fright Night. I did watch it somewhere around 1989 and promptly forgot it. I don't know what that means - either I didn't think much of it or my memory's shot to bits.The original is still heralded as a classic by many horror fans, but, as I couldn't remember it, I went into this remake with little to no expectations. And, from what I saw, it copied the original pretty well. It didn't do a shot-by-shot remake, but kept the overall feel of the first movie (based on what I've read about its predecessor), i.e. a blend of comedy, horror and gore.Maybe this remake would have sunk without a trace, but it's lent a hand by a pretty decent cast. A good start is A-lister Colin Farrell as the enjoyably evil vampire, then you have ex Dr Who David Tennant, Toni Collette, Imogen Poots, Anton Yelchin and the always amusing Christopher Mintz-Plasse.Charming Colin Farrell moves in next door to Anton Yelchin and it's not long before he's 'outed' as a vampire. Soon people start getting their throats torn out and a decent amount of bloodshed is to follow.Fright Night is nothing too revolutionary, but vampires have been so in fashion of late that it's hard to find a completely original movie in the genre. It's a popcorn flick. It you fancy something frothy and lightweight then you might enjoy this (alternatively, the ladies may just fancy Colin Farrell - I'm sure they'll be happy with what they get).Fright Night (2011) gets a respectable 7/10. If you're tired of seeing vampires that sparkle in sunlight, try this one. It's old school throat-tearing.",Fright Night

31,g-bodyl,Actually Quite Scary!,9,14 March 2013,"Fright Night, the 2011 remake of the 1985 film, is actually a really good film that features lots of thrills and chills. These days, I fear any vampire movie that is released will end up being just like a Twilight film. I'm glad to report that this film features vampire violence, gore, and very little romance which is the total opposite of the Twilight films. Granted, I have not seen the original film but I this is a good stand-alone film and one that most horror fans should enjoy.This film is about a mysterious stranger who moves next door to the Brewster family. It turns out that this neighbor, Jerry, happens to be a member of the supernatural family. When he becomes a threat to everyone they know, Charley Brewster hires a vampire professional to end the threat.I feel really bad for Colin Farrell. When he puts up a great performance, no one goes out to see him. Unfortunately, Mr. Farrell is a box office disaster as this film was. But, he was really good as Jerry. He blends together a mixture of comedy and horror to make a very memorable character. David Tennant is really good as the vampire professional because he is pretty funny.Overall, this is a great film that may be better than the original. This is not a one hundred percent horror film which is great because I'm not a big horror fan. This film has plenty of comedy and with a dark premise, that addition is welcome. This is one of the better vampire films made within the past decade. I rate this film 9/10.",Fright Night

Evil thingies with piranha teeth has been a hot prop the past few years but is also getting a bit old. Creative part: There were enough twists to the story in terms of who our lead vamp was; who was bitten; the search for the teen vamp hunter's helper and the tools acquired to accomplish the fait accompli.

36,tabuno,Starts Out Strong But Descends Into Ordinary,6,18 January 2019,"21 August 2011. Twenty-Six years later, Colin Farrell (Jerry) reprises Chris Sarandon's vampire (Jerry Dandrige) in a grown up, less campy version that extends a qualitative, substantive component that continues for half the movie. What is notable, is that for a good amount of the movie, the characters are more believable and the traditional, two-dimensional and even the goofy ones still have some depth to them. There is a nice balance and contemporary feel in the first half that lends to a quality sequel. Unfortunately, the love interest in the sequel is so strong a character as to raises doubts a'bout why she would even be interested in an ""ordinary"" but in the sequels instance a more even-handed, grown up nerd (though a later, belated scene seems to quickly explain her attraction). Roddy McDowell's character (Peter Vincent) now played by David Tennant of Dr. Who fame, has the most difficult job and recharacterization of the movie, and does a good job of transforming himself from his earlier incarnation of a dorky Time Lord into something more hard-lined with flashes of comedy. Additionally, Toni Collette as the mom doesn't get to have the same flourishing mother-son dynamics as the originally, when instead there is literally an explosive scene from which the movie unfortunately descends half into the movie into the more action, horror, physical scary movie that loses the magic that has made the 1985 original into a semi-cult charming vampire genre. The seduction of the vampire is almost completely left out of the screenplay by both Jerry and the love interest (Amy). Colin Farrell does a commendable job and his acting is sharp, yet the screen play seems to appear to let him down from what could have been a consistently much more intensely balanced good and evil character of which a more complex sympathy could have been obtained (that is only suggested by Farrell's character relatively early in the movie in one or two scenes with Alton Yelchin (Charly).",Fright Night

The idea of a late night horror host being recruited to help a young fan battle the vampire who's moved in next door, was a good one; the execution, however, left more than a little to be desired. This remake doesn't even have the virtue of being original- and in execution makes the original look like a masterpiece. When the fullest extent of a filmmaker's storytelling ability has to do solely with the technical execution of an fx shot or a slick, television-commercial-like moment or two (while the ""story"" being told comes across as disjointed, at best), you end up with something like this. Anyone who thinks that this is a film worth the time it takes to wade through it has far too much time on their hands.",Fright Night
39,TheMovieDiorama,"Fright Night does not make me frightened of night, rather instead makes me tolerate it.",5,25 June 2018,"Within the dark depths of Hollywood, some mortal thought it would be a genius idea to remake the 1985 cult classic. Whilst it retains some enjoyment, it is messier than a vampire's drunken night out (hint: pretty messy). At the time of this review, I have not seen the original so shall not be making comparisons. A suburban teenager realises that his friends are rapidly becoming missing, he investigates the disappearance of his old best friend only to find that he may be living next door to a vampire. Marketed as a horror thriller, but actually rather a cacophony of gothically presented genres that feel mundane and outdated. Very reminiscent of 80s classics like 'The Lost Boys' and I'm sure the original 'Fright Night', but this symmetrical representation is costly. The campy aesthetics negates any horrifying thrills, particularly in 2011, and the comedic elements frequently miss. That's not to say the two don't complement each other, as brutal fights with the undead should always be finished off with a one liner. ""Welcome to the fright night"". Enjoyably cringeworthy, fortunately the film acknowledges that and takes full advantage. Fantastic performances from Farrell and Tennant, who play a chiselled pouting vampire and self-proclaimed vampire hunter respectively. Mintz-Plasse was an unusual casting choice who adds no humour to the narrative. The visual effects and monster makeup were poor. I'm not beating around the blood soaked bush, it was bad. Blood spluttering from freshly bitten necks looked terrible. Human faces transforming into elongated vampiric jaws was hideously mediocre. The constant need to produce 3D gimmicky effects hindered certain scenes and made the whole film look cheap, as if it was more appropriate being a TV film. However, Gillespie's directing talent prevents this. Just a shame that the old school approach ironically adds a hundred years onto the film. Enjoyably outdated, but outdated nonetheless. More importantly, how the heck did Farrell not get any blood on his shirt?",Fright Night

43,dfranzen70,Bests the original by dialing back the cheese,7,19 August 2011,"I saw the original Fright Night, and I think this one's much better. Scarier, right amount of cheese and camp, terrific, dead-on acting. Excellent thriller, especially (as much as I hate to admit it) in 3D.Anton Yelchin (Star Trek) is Charlie Brewster, a high schooler who lives in a town outside of Las Vegas with his single mom, played by Toni Collette. Charlie has a gorgeous girlfriend (Imogen Poots) and cool-kid friends. One of his older friends, Ed (Christopher Mintz-Plasse of Superbad and Kick-Ass) comes to him and asks for Charlie's help; it seems that a third friend has gone missing, and Ed believes vampires are to blame. Specifically, he feels that Charlie's new next-door neighbor Jerry (Colin Farrell) is the chief vampire and is literally sucking the town dry.I was fortunate enough to watch this as a sneak preview, because I don't think I would have splurged for the 3D version. But it's totally worth it. The film will be subtly 3D for most of the time, and then all of a sudden something will unexpectedly - but plausibly - come flying at you. Love it. Well done, well executed, very detailed use of the technology, for a change.Charlie necessarily turns to a TV vampire (think of a Criss Angel knockoff) who's rehearsing for his Vegas show. In the original, the role was that of a late-night horror-movie TV host, played by Roddy McDowell, but here he's played with almost demented glee by David Tennant (Dr. Who). What good is a fake vampire hunter against a real vampire? A little good, as it turns out.The movie's exciting. It's funny without straining for laughs; it's scary without forcing fear. It doesn't get mired in overexposition: Farrell's vampire is just there, no explanation needed; tropes of vampire lore are mentioned, but no background material is needed. Its simplicity is its greatest asset.The cast as a whole is strong, particularly Farrell, who plays creepy and diabolical better than I thought possible. He's always been able to be violent, but this role brought a different level of acting out of him. Well played.Suffice to say that if you don't like vampire movies, there's no reason in the world for you to watch this. So don't. You'll just get mad, and there's no need for that. If you do have a yen for the macabre, though, you would do well to give this a look.",Fright Night

45,estebangonzalez10,Jerry the Vampire,6,10 December 2011,"¨Hey, guy. You've been watching me. I've been watching you.¨  Fright Night is a remake of the 1985 cult classic film of the same name  which was written and directed by Tom Holland (known for several 80's  and 90's horror flicks including Child's Play and the TV series Tales  from the Crypt). Some people don't like the fact that these classic  movies are being remade, but if done well it can work because a new  generation that would've probably never seen the original can now be  familiar with it. Director Craig Gillespie does a great job at adapting  the story and bringing it to the big screen once again. He makes a few  touches here and there, but the main idea is still there and there is  even a cameo from Chris Sarandon (the actor that played the vampire in  the first movie). Some of the most memorable lines from the original  movie are also included here. Gillespie takes an entirely different  approach than he did with his first film, Lars and the Real Girl, but  he makes a decent horror/comedy film which stays true to the original  so I think fans of that movie won't be disappointed with this. Fright  Night is much better than most horror films we've seen lately, although  there isn't as much scares as there are funny moments. The film is  lifted by some strong performances from Colin Farrell, Toni Collette,  David Tennant, Anton Yelchin, and Imogen Poots. The other positive  thing about Fright Night is that Buffy the Vampire Slayer writer, Marti  Noxon, was involved in the adaptation of the screenplay which is pretty  slick and funny.  Charley Brewster (Anton Yelchin) is probably having the best year of  his life. He seems to have been accepted with the cool group of his  High School and is dating one of the hottest girls in school, Amy  (Imogen Poots). Charley is having a great time with his new friends and  tries to ignore his old geek buddy Ed (Christopher Mintz-Plasse) as  much as he can, but Ed is worried about some mysterious disappearances  in the Las Vegas neighborhood and tells Charley that his new neighbor,  Jerry (Colin Farrell) is a vampire. Ed has been spying on Jerry and has  discovered his secret, but Charley doesn't believe him at first until  he sees things on his own. Charley warns his mother, Jane (Toni  Collette), not to trust Jerry and under any circumstance invite him  into the house, but Jane thinks he is just being a jealous son and  ignores him at first. Jerry realizes that Charley is on to him and  threatens him and his girlfriend. Charley decides it's time to face  Jerry and end his 400 year life. In order to do so he enlists the help  of Peter Vincent (David Tennant), a Vegas performer who claims to be a  Vampire slayer, but of course this is all just a gimmick. Vincent  believes Charley is crazy at first, but he soon will find out the truth  about Jerry, and discover some things about his own past.   Beside the fact that Colin Farrell delivers a perfect performance as  Jerry the vampire, the other thing that Fright Night has going for it  is that it has a clever and funny script. There are few scares; the  movie knows it works best as a comedy in the same way that Zombieland  had success making fun of its zombies. This time the jokes are about  vampires and of course all the legends about the crucifixes, the stakes  to the heart, and the need to ask for permission to enter a house  aren't ignored here. This last element taken from the very successful  vampire Swedish film Let the Right One In (which in my humble opinion  is the best vampire film ever). It also manages to make fun of Twilight  whenever given the chance claiming that vampires aren't sentimental and  even makes references to that movie. Colin Farrell is the star of the  film, but the rest of the actors also did a great job. Anton Yelchin is  a good actor and he nails his role with his charming innocence. Toni  Collette looks great playing her mother, and Imogen Poots is much more  than the typical dumb blonde. Christopher Mintz-Plasse and David  Tennant are responsible for most of the laughs of the film and the  funny moments. The movie is well made, it's clever, entertaining, I  just wish it would've been scarier. The effects are pretty well done  and there's also plenty of blood for gore fans. Despite everything the  movie has going for it, I don't think I would've enjoyed it as much if  it weren't for Colin Farrell. He lifts this movie and makes it worth  seeing.

We also have the hot girl-next-door and assorted teen angst. I wouldn't say this was a great movie but it was entertaining, even creepy at times and gave me a few laughs. I also really enjoyed the entire cast; Anton Yelchin as 'Charlie' does a great job, Toni Collette as the mother, David Tennant was excellent (and hilarious) as Peter Vincent and Colin Farrell, while a strange choice as a vampire was definitely charismatic and super sexy.

The actors do their characters justice, especially Colin Farrell, he was by far the film's best performance! No one could have done Jerry better justice or fit the role better than Farrell. Anton was awesome too! He was the perfect choice for that role! He totally embodied the starring role of Charlie, and brought some real depth to him. Toni Collete is here too, and I was very pleased with her portrayal of Charlie's mother here, she doesn't have a whole whole lot of screen time, but she definitely makes good use of the time she is given. The plot is intriguing and the execution of the plot is what makes this remake of the 80s film so good. The chemistry that the characters have on screen is spot on and it brings a lot to the movie, chemistry is very crucial factor when it comes to all films. The screenplay is entertaining, fun, and engaging. The fight/action scenes aren't too overly graphic, and they are thrilling and fun to watch. Now, as far as the effects go, I wasn't all too impressed with them, they seemed just a bit lackluster if you ask me, but that's one of very few flaws in the movie.

This remake does exactly what I want from a remake. It keeps the core components, but makes enough changes to make it a different movie. The little changes make all the difference, and although I preferred everything in the original, this is a different film that I will check out again. Yelchin plays the lead role of a young man that eventually finds out his neighbour is a vampire. Farrell is the charming, sexy, and sinister vampire named Jerry. The tension heightens, but never as much as the original. I loved Farrell's portrayal, where he was truly threatening without ever really trying. However, he was also inexplicably aggressive. I'd imagine vampires would try and keep their heads down, but here Farrell doesn't exactly try and hide his vampiristic tendencies. He'll kill people in the street, or blow up a house. Tennant is a scene stealer as Peter Vincent, a clever update from his predecessor, but with some needless backstory. Tennant is the archetypal fake hero, that claims to be a slayer of the occult. But when his chance to prove his heroism comes to fruition, will he rise to the challenge? The humour and horror are well mixed together, with some scenes being particularly shocking, which is a great compliment for such a worn genre. It is also a very exciting action films at time. The car chase scene, shot in one continuous take is exhilarating and has a nice cameo too. Sometimes it has too much CGI, and more plot holes than I feel comfortable with.

54,breakdownthatfilm-blogspot-com,A worthy remake,8,14 August 2013,"Tom Holland's Fright Night (1985) is one of the few vampire film's the non-Twilight fans enjoy. Not only did have good make-up effects for its time, but it also had likable characters and a contemporary plot that audiences had never thought about before. And because of its success, three years later spawned Fright Night Part 2 (1988), which like many sequels had a diminishing return but still had a strong following. Jump to 25 years later and we have the remake that I can't say everyone wanted to see, but for the people who were tired of the Twilight series, definitely had something different to watch here. Especially for those who never saw the original to begin with.The plot is the same as the original, a teenage boy, Charlie Brewster, figures out that his next door neighbor is a vampire and soon finds out the vampire is out to get him, his friends and family. Remember though, for any of you readers who saw the original, this is a remake so not every scene will be done the same. For example, instead of Charlie discovering the vampire on his own, a classmate friend of his tells him. This is just one of several differences between this film and the original. But that's the only difference - the scenes, and Marti Noxon did a fine job at writing the screenplay. After all it's not her first time writing a story about vampires. Noxon also wrote the story for Buffy the Vampire Slayer (1996). Besides, everything else is kept relatively the same from characters, to effects and gore.Playing Charlie Brewster is Anton Yelchin, an actor who has been filling the shoes of several famous characters now like Kyle Reese from the Terminator series, Chekov from the Star Trek series and now this. Yelchin is convincing as a teenager because he has the baby face to prove it, plus his voice isn't that deep. Playing the charismatic Peter Vincent (the famous vampire slayer) is David Tennant, who also gives a performance that is much enjoyable for his sarcastic attitude. Surprisingly, even Chris Sarandon, the original vampire from Tom Holland's classic, has a brief cameo. Watch out for him, his screen time isn't long.But if there's one character that tops them all, it's Colin Farrell's performance as Jerry, the vampire next door. The best parts are when Farrell makes his character act like a human being. The movements, mannerisms and smooth voice make him one slippery little devil. In fact, one could say that Farrell had a lot of fun with this role because of how much he smiled in every frame. Some of the scenes that he plays in are actually quite comical, even though the movie's basis is the horror genre. But there will be times where you can't help but laugh because of how awkwardly hilarious the situation may seem.However, if there was one thing that didn't help Farrell look more like a vampire was the CGI special effects. When the vampire face of Jerry takes over it doesn't look as real as it should be. I don't know, perhaps I wasn't expecting a whole facial reconstruction when he decided to transform. He honestly didn't even look like a vampire to me, which just made him look fake. The gore and blood was there but that was also mixed too. There were some scenes where it mixed well with real objects and then there were other scenes where it look like it was added in last minute. That should have been skimmed over a little more I think. The music was great though. Ramin Djawadi's score had a main theme and contained a lot of strings and organ sounds which are key in creating horror music. Well done.The remake to the 1985 vampire flick is a fair match to its original. The music is appropriate, and actors perform well, especially Colin Farrell. The special effects may look unfinished though.",Fright Night
55,p-stepien,Its own movie,7,13 January 2013,"Teenager Charley Brewster (Anton Yelchin), living in Las Vegas suburbs, has managed to advance from his lowly position as a dweeb thanks to entering a relationship with Amy (Imogen Poots). The social progression however brings about a push to change his friends, thus excluding his best pal and ultra-nerd Ed (Christopher Mintz-Plasse) from his contacts. Ed attempts to warn Charley that his next door neighbour Jerry (Colin Farrell) is a blood-thirsty vampire and soon after disappears. Thus Charley's suspicions start to build and he soon finds himself seeking assistance of illusionist and self-proclaimed vampire-hunter Peter Vincent (David Tennant). Who turns out to be a egocentric prick...A rare case of a remake, which draws inspiration and references from the original, but aims to deliver a fresh new story and outlook. Although all the characters are the same knowing the original won't help you piece together the entire plot, at best leaving you to admire the subtle and not-so-subtle changes to the story. Colin Farrell with his magnetic presence makes for a great neighbourhood vampire - powerful, ruthless, sexually enamouring, but simultaneously controlled and seemingly 'ordinary'. Whereas Farrell is an improvement on the original, David Tennant comes with a 'different' take on Peter Vincent, neither inferior or superior, just alternate and equally enjoyable. Summarily (apart from some miscued acting by Mintz-Plasse) the cast fleshes out a new perspective, which makes ""Fright Night"" a self-sustaining horror, irrespective of the original with a markedly different story fronted by a great cast.The is no Hitchcock type attempt to introduce doubt as to the identity of the neighbour. We know he's a vampire and the only question is how quickly others will recognise this obvious reality. Unfortunately Jerry's happy-go-lucky attitude towards getting it his way, introduces an aching necessity to suspend belief in plot feasibility (well... naturally... if vampires really existed). The plot holes are pretty much the biggest flaw, while the lack of uncertainty lowers the suspense bar, thus having the story sold through its intriguing narrative and some well drafted characters. As such the well struck mixture of comedy, action and some horror flair pretty much helps to cover up the problematic issues from the basic premise (which is in fact much better worked than in the original as various idiosyncrasies are reimagined with smarts, such as placing the story in the evanescent Las Vegas quarters).",Fright Night
56,moviewizguy,You can't run from evil when it lives next door.,7,19 August 2011,"Senior Charlie Brewster finally has it all: He's running with the popular crowd and dating the hottest girl in high school. In fact, he's so cool he's even dissing his best friend Ed. But trouble arrives when an intriguing stranger Jerry moves in next door. He seems like a great guy at first, but there's something not quite right, and everyone, including Charlie's mom, doesn't notice. After witnessing some very unusual activity, Charlie comes to an unmistakable conclusion: Jerry is a vampire preying on his neighborhood. Unable to convince anyone that he's telling the truth, Charlie has to find a way to get rid of the monster himself. -- (C) DreamWorksAlthough the original FRIGHT NIGHT was downright cheesy (from the effects to the performances), its balance of humor and scares made it entertaining. This remake takes the basic storyline and modernizes it, like how DISTURBIA modernized REAR WINDOW. Apart from the fact that the story is still the same, the plot changes quite a bit. In fact, the first half of the film has more in common with DISTURBIA than the original film itself, and the second half veers off in a completely different direction from the original, although there are some recognizable similarities. There are also some clever updates that improves upon the original film, like how the setting is now in Vegas, where people work and party all night and sleep all day, which is a perfect location for a vampire to hunt if you ask me.With all the changes, the remake does retain the original's wackiness without taking itself too seriously. There's a sense of self-awareness that is common upon many horror films these days that try to be cool and hip, but it works here. As much as it works as a comedy, there are some scary scenes as well due to director Craig Gillespie building up the suspense. There's one jaw dropping sequence in particular that is very well orchestrated. Without spoiling anything, I will say that it's all in one impressive long take. Unfortunately, the film does favor the use of CGI over the original's practical effects, which should be expected in a modern horror film. Some of it looked rather cartooney and cheesy.Most of the characters are changed as well, even from their screen time. Amy's character, played wonderfully by Imogen Poots, has a more substantial role here. Where in the original Amy was pretty useless and girly, this updated Amy is more in the line of modern heroines, which is another way to say that she kicked ass. Toni Collette has some time to shine as well playing Charley's mother, Jane. Where she pretty much disappears halfway in the original, Jane is actually brought into some of the exciting action here. Evil Ed, played by Christopher Mintz- Plasse, is also changed dramatically (and for the better) and gone is his cheesy line, ""You're so cool, Brewster!"" However, I will say that he is the weakest link in the film, mainly because I couldn't take him seriously (which is due to the fact that I still remember him as McLovin).The film's main character is played well by Anton Yelchin, but the more colorful supporting actors really outshine him here, especially David Tennant, who plays Peter Vincent. Going by the pattern, his character from the original is also changed to a British drunk who works as a Vegas star in which Tennant plays really well. And lastly, the film's villain, Jerry, is played wonderfully by Colin Farrell, who really never loses his cool. Although much younger, he definitely brings the same charisma into the role as Chris Sarandon did in the original.Overall, FRIGHT NIGHT (2011) is very enjoyable, funny, scary, and is definitely one of the better remakes that have come around. Its use of old-school vampire lore is surprisingly refreshing considering that the TWILIGHT SAGA is the standard of what vampires are these days, and the cast is terrific. As for the 3D, I'd say skip it and watch it in 2D if you can because the majority of the film does take place at night, so it was hard for me to see what was going on.",Fright Night
57,Screen_Blitz,"Fright Night exhibits no significant improvement over the original, but it makes for some sweet campy fun",7,6 August 2017,"For the past few decades, Hollywood has engaged in a long-running trend of remaking classic horror films from the 70s and 80s. More than not, these update have lead to lumbering disappointments in capturing the spirits of their original source materials. Fortunately, this remake of the 1985 horror flick 'Fright Night' is one of the few exceptions that does its duty. Directed by Craig Gillespie, this stylish vampire horror film carries roughly the same story and characters, executing these elements with proficiency while paying respect to its original source material. What are filmgoers in for? Not a film that will necessarily provoke nightmares in your sleep, but will provide a campy, gory fun with a solid dose of humor in the mix. And to add a little spicing, it is done in 3-D which will allow viewers to experience the action flying at them before their very eyes. Although Gillespie never boasts any improvements over the original film, his greatest success lies within his appealing execution of the man-versus-bloodsucker tale. Set in the suburbs of Las Vegas, this film follows 17-year old Charley Brewster (played by Anton Yelchin), a popular high school student dating a hot blondie named Amy (played by Imogen Poots) and hanging with his pals Mark (played by Dave Franco) and Ben (played by Reid Ewing). With his social standings rising, his popularity has put his former best friend Ed (played by Christopher Mintz-Plasse) in the shadows. When a handsome young man Jerry Dandridge (played by Colin Ferrell) movies in next door, Charley soon finds his and his mother's life in danger upon discovering that he is not the man next door, but a blood-sucking vampire out for human blood. And the only one who can help him is no one other than a vampire television show host Peter Vincent (played by David Tennant) who has the expertise on the world of vampires.Not once does this film try to be anything groundbreaking or particularly anything masterful. It is a teen-oriented vampire flick that knows what it is and embraces the soul that made the 1985 original at hit. And the good news is it knows how to have fun while not only splashing the screen with R-rated blood and gore, exhibiting intellect in the rules of surviving against a vampire. With the obvious rules being sunlight leads vampires into a fiery grave and the other way to kill them is by driving a stake through their heart, the story expands upon another notable rule involving the vicious monsters requiring an invitation to enter the house. If the house you enter is abandoned, the vampire exempt from the necessity of an invitation. This accounts to a scary, yet clever scene when Jerry enters the house that has been abandoned on foreclosure. As for the story, the director does a pleasant job on building up the tension that leads to an pulse- pounding climax. In the process, the film stays mostly engaging by not blanketing the atmosphere with endless dread but poking fun at the genre with character sprouting humor with witty dialogue. This aspect is greatly accomplished by the cast including Colin Ferrell, substituting Chris Sarandon who offers an unexpected cameo in one scene, as Jerry Dandridge who boasts a tasty performance as the infamous blood-sucker. Demonstrating a sense of wit and dark comedic appeal, Ferrell proves himself suitably fit in the antagonistic role. Then there is Anton Yelchin who shares some sweet chemistry with his co-stars including Imogen Poots as his girlfriend and most notably Toni Collette as his naive mother who makes for some humorous interaction with him, particularly in the scenes when he is imploring her about the sinister persona Jerry hides behind the mask. If there is anyone in the cast, however, that stands along Ferrell on stealing the show, it is David Tennant who boasts an energetic Russell Brand-like comedic presence with his wise-cracking humor and profane, yet explosively hilarious one-liners. Just wait for him to get a hold of some booze. Fright Night is a stylish, witty, and fun vampire flick that invites viewers, particularly horror fans, in for some sweet campy fun. By almost no means does this film shed improvement over the original film from the 1980s. Nonetheless, Craig Gillespie's rendition of the vampire tale strikes with one hell of a bit.",Fright Night
58,oneguyrambling,A modern day update of the classic 85 flick. Doesn't embarrass itself.,7,3 February 2012,"There was nothing much wrong with the original Fright Night from 1985. I reviewed it earlier this year and gave it what I think is a solid recommendation.But a generation has passed since that was released, and movie audiences experience precious little rush at discovering a film a quarter century old that their parents like. So here we are. A fun little remake of Fright Night with an update to more present day conventions – meaning more swearing, more frank discussions of sex, more skin and more relevant music. None of these are bad things by the way.Right this guy is Charlie Brewster. Charlie is the son of a single mum (Toni Collette) living in a small housing estate on the outskirts of Las Vegas, a settlement with an itinerant population boasting many shift workers and night owls.Charlie was until very recently one of the class geeks, though somehow he has ascended up the popularity ladder and is now one of the cool kids. This apparently entitles him to a hot girlfriend named Amy (Imogen Poots) and unsolicited comments from neighbouring hot chicks in tight pants along the lines of ""Gee Charlie you're getting big"" while said hottie takes out the garbage.I now invite, suggest, demand that you look again at the picture of Charlie taken from his performance in this very film. If that all sounds logical and above board the next bit shouldn't test your powers of imagination one iota.Charlie's childhood friend – and unfortunately still a nerd – Ed (Christopher Mintz-Plasse, 4 years on from McLovin and STILL resigned to nerdy sidekick roles) is not distracted by the writing on the derrieres of hotties nor the stirrings in his own fashionable slacks, therefore he sees what others do not. Ed points out the fact that several kids in class have simply and inexplicably stopped showing up, then backs up this anomaly with a theory: it must be the work of a vampire.Ed not only theorises the proximity of an undead bloodsucker but he also identifies his accused, Charlie's brand new next door neighbour named Jerry, who conveniently pops by shortly afterward to introduce himself and to make drooling puddles of both Charlie's Mum and girlfriend. Jerry is buff, hot, mysterious and nice initially.For those who saw the entertaining low key original not much has changed, Charlie and co quickly learn the truth – it's fair to say that Jerry isn't too fixated on maintaining anonymity – and the remainder of the film has them dealing with the new development.This time though instead of a creaky old has been horror show host Charlie seeks out the advice of the only man who could possibly provide a plan of attack, a renowned Vegas magician and supposed guru regarding all things vampire named Peter Vincent, who is initially reticent to become involved but is gradually drawn into proceedings. The character of Vincent starts out a little one note but he becomes increasingly amusing and reminiscent of Russell Brand at times.The Fright Night remake wisely doesn't take things too seriously like remakes of Nightmare on Elm Street and Halloween have done in recent years. It neatly tiptoes the line between shlocky horror and silly comedy, ably assisted by the performance from Colin Farrell that leaves the film no option but to stay at least a little silly. (It is a 'vampire next door' comedy set in Vegas after all.) Things only get a little out of hand in the closing scenes where it all gets a little S.W.A.T. Paintball Commando for a few moments, with the predictable results that would ensue given such a description, but the CGI assisted gore thankfully never oversteps the mark and Peter Vincent and Jerry keep the film on the right side of the fun ledger.Final Rating – 7 / 10. Fright Night 2011 is a fun way to spend an evening, and like 2010's remake of 'Let the Right One in' called 'Let me in', it benefits from more or less remaining faithful to the source material and by not being too clever for its own good.(I still think the least plausible thing in the film is the nerdy kid with the hot girlfriend receiving random compliments from similarly hot strangers.)",Fright Night
59,gedikreverdi,There's a vampire named Jerry in Las Vegas,7,10 March 2021,Having a vampire next door in the middle of a desert in Las Vegas sounds like an awesome adventure and it is indeed. Toni Colette was great and Collin Farrell is an amazing vampire. The former doctor who guy who's a vampire specialist helped them kill the vampire with a special stake which turns the victims of that vampire back to normal. They discovered the secret space down the basement where he buried the ones he turned and buried in the dirt. They all came out and they started to fight. Charlie could kill the vampire named jerry with that stake and everyone turned back to normal. I haven't seen the original so I can't compare them but this was by itself a very enjoyable vampire flick with good actors although the scare factor wasn't that high and it was by no means boring.,Fright Night

Yelchin, Poots, Colette, Tenent, and several other familiar faces round out the cast in a great way.You're a teenage boy with a pretty, single Mom and a gorgeous girlfriend to think about.

61,thekarmicnomad,Tails of a bit too early,6,12 December 2011,"Like a lot of people I saw the original and loved it (but then there was less competition back then)In a lot of ways this is much better. Colin Farrell does an excellent job as moody hottie on the block and watching him and Anton dance around each other trying to avoid saying the 'V' word is a joy. Not a big fan of Tennant and his character is ludicrous but somehow he pulls it off and I found him genuinely funny.The problem with all these types of movie is they have to turn up the heat and get the action going. Nine out of ten times (like here) the director stamps on the accelerator and wheel-spins off into next doors garden.Suddenly the plot is torn to shreds as locations, characters and scenes are man-handled into the story to accommodate the acceptable quoter of stakings and be-headings. The previous hour of the movie, which was a joy to watch, suddenly feels like a waste of time as vampires dash all over the show blowing things up.Saying that the movie is light-hearted, fun and half the people I watched this with really loved it. If you only expect a silly horror-com (like the original) then you are going to have a pleasant evening.",Fright Night
62,MrGKB,Offers no genuine threat of replacing the original...,6,8 October 2011,"...not that anyone genuinely thought it would, but Craig ""The United States of Tara"" Gillespie's take on the 80s cult favorite, ""Fright Night,"" is not entirely a failure; it's just not as good as it could have been, most likely the fault of Marti ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"" Noxon's 3D-fixated and otherwise emasculated script.Gone is the ambiguous sex appeal of Jerry the vampire, assayed this time around as a buff beer-drinking proletarian by Colin ""Phone Booth"" Farrell, an actor of considerable talent, but little of the urbane charm of Chris ""watch for my cameo!"" Sarandon. The original's camp element is reduced by the transformation of our hero, Charley Brewster, from bookish Everyman to aspiring BMOC, the unabashed nerdification of ""Evil"" Ed, the switching of Brewster's mother from mousy hausfrau to full-bore MILF, and--the largest mistake of all--the revamping (sorry) of Peter Vincent from quirky late-night creature-feature host to jaded Las Vegas impresario. In truth, the only major character that benefits from being rethought is Amanda, the love interest, whose only real flaw is that she's so beautiful it's hard to accept she has that much interest in Charley, despite her avowal that the script carefully provides.The result of all these ""re-imaginings"" is a film that is quite impressively competent on a technical level (and I didn't even see it in 3D), but mostly unsatisfying on an emotional level. The characters simply aren't as engaging as those in the Tom Holland original, and there are just a few too many ""Hey, wait a minute!""s for lasting comfort for the discerning viewer. The acting is fine, the photography by Javier ""The Road"" Aguirrerobe is reasonably kinetic, and Ramin ""Game of Thrones"" Djawadi's score suits the tone of the film well, and Gillespie's direction is serviceable, if unextraordinary storytelling. Movies have to move, yes, but they need to go somewhere the audience wants to go, and in a way that doesn't upset its willing suspension of disbelief. This version of ""Fright Night"" is fangless in that regard.4.27.12 edit: I recently rewatched this one on video, and stand by my comments above. I noted again that Jerry's rapacity begs the question of why the authorities and the neighborhood take so little notice of his depredations. A murder/disappearance wave like the one he unleashes would draw instant attention; these aren't hapless transients he's bumping off. Meanwhile, I remain bemused at just how fast this critter hollowed out and outfitted his rather extensive subterranean lair and disposed of all the evidence without attracting undue interest.",Fright Night
63,ASouthernHorrorFan,"My Review Of ""Fright Night""",5,24 July 2013,"Admittedly I was one of the many fans super-excited about the remake of ""Fright Night"". It is one of my all time favorite films to sit back on a chilly day when I am feeling blah and just enjoy based on pure nostalgia. I also remember setting in the theatre at 13 and being scared sh*tless of Jerry Dandrige. I think I held my breath through most of the picture terrified of what would happen next. So yeah I am still just a little disappointed when I watch the remake with Colin Farrell in the role of the seductive older man new in the neighborhood who just wants to be left alone to feed. I do like the fact that the story was so different that there was very little to compare to the original. Other than the names and a few key moments that were more like nods to the 1985 film than mirror images there was little to go on with this film. The story was simple but smart, the characters were just a little too one dimensional and left the story feeling flat. It seemed that at pivotal moments when the characters should have been more animated they came off seeming unsure of who they were in relation to the story. Maybe the actors listened to all the hype or bad press buzzing around the net while filming ""Fright Night"" or maybe they just saw it as a paycheck. Either way the only character that seemed to care at all about her role in the film was Toni Collette as Ms. Brewster. She had a very limited role so that is saying something there. The characters I wanted to see really play out on screen was that of Peter Vincent and Jerry Dandrige. Those should have been the roles that pushed this film beyond re-animation and placed it into a reboot category. Instead they came off almost dead inside and pointless to the story-Like an after thought.Now it pains me to say bad things about any film that is part of a genre I love but I really am slightly sad about this film being so under whelming. The effects seemed a little SyFy channel to me and at key moments when the scares could have really sold me on this film they seemed contrived. As if there was some check list off stage and the director just went through each kill and gore moment repetitiously then said ""okay, cut!"" The original had so much more wow and shock factor than this remake. Which I know you can't really compare the two stories because there was enough of a variation to keep this newer version individual except by today's standards and abilities in film making there is so much more that a film can utilize in order to scare the sh*t out of us and this film just didn't do that.I am still on the fence about adding this film to my collection. On one hand it has Collin Farrell in it and I have a nice collection of his stuff on my shelves. I have to say though there are so many things that disappointed me in this film that I just don't know if his hotness is enough for me to embrace this movie. I may just hold out for ""Total Recall"" to come out and prey they don't f*ck that film up as well.",Fright Night
64,ivo-cobra8,A worthy remake to the classic original horror flick!,8,30 October 2015,"R.I.P. Anton Yelchin (1989 - 2016). It is a tragedy he past away yesterday so young and he is no longer with us anymore. So my review is dedicated in memory of Anton. Fright Night (2011) I s a really good decent remake of the original horror flick Fright Night (1985). Usually I hate remakes and reboots, but there are some good remakes that I like. Fright Night is one of them! I love Vampire movies and this one is pretty good and well done. I know that Original is the best vampire slasher horror film, but that doesn't mean that remake is awful, which is not! This movie is good and has a good story and does not copy the original. The idea of this film is pure originality. The writers and the director did not copy the original film, but he used his imaginative, that's what makes this film so good. This film is very hated and bashed from critics and fans who just don't understand this film, I do and I love it. It is my favorite slasher comedy horror vampire flick! Sorry but I love it! This remake is actually good, it Is not bad it is good! - I enjoyed it - The scene when Colin is in the doorway and he is telling Charlie that it's up to him to look out for his girl & his mom - Colin plays that scene just about perfect - a warning & menacing at the same time:)!!!! This movie is fun I loved it. It didn't drag, it was just right, It had a comedy and it had a horror to it, it was a good remake! An example of a good horror remake. Colin Farrell is extremely, extremely underrated in everything he does, it is sad because he is awesome as Jerry the vampire, I like him as vampire. This awesome actor made me lough before he even told a joke. And I just lough because this guy is awesome. This was just a good fun time at the movie theater, I didn't see it in movie theater but you know what I mean, it is a good fun time. It has fun with it, doesn't take it self too serious, like the original one did, which kind a brought the movie down for me. This one knows it is a satire comedy, horror comedy and it treats it as such. Too bad this movie failed! Of all the remakes this one failed! Well the sucky remakes make the money! This is by far the second good horror remake I believe, the first one will always gonna be My Blood Valentine 3D (2009) and the third will be Sorority Row (2009) not that good horror flick but still a good horror film! I am sorry that was awesome, I did enjoyed this movie. This was an excellent film that distinguished itself from the amazing original but still through out a few shout outs here and there. The cast was awesome with amazing performances by Colin Farrell & Anton Yelchin in the staring roles. The good thing: Amy's (Imogen Poots) part from the original as a girl not sure of herself has been changed to more of a girl who isn't shy about herself or how she feels about Charlie. Also, instead of Ed (Christopher Mintz-Plasse) being the skeptic, it's now Charlie (Anton Yelchin) who doesn't believe his next-door neighbor is a vampire. The bad: I have one problem with it and that is David Tennant as great vampire slayer Peter Vincent, don't get me wrong but for me will always be Roddy McDowall as Peter Vincent, cause this actor can kick the out of David Tennant''s ass and any vampire out there. I wish they would putt Roddy McDowall back in the role instead of David Tennat. I don't like this version of Peter Vincent AT ALL - they should have kept him true to the original. But Roddy McDowall died in 1998 before they could cast him back. May the actor rest in peace. It is sad he is no longer with us anymore. The basic plot is about Jerry Dandridge (Colin Farrell). He's dangerously charming – and utterly lethal. That's because he just happens to be a vampire, and out for bloodbuckets of it. After high school senior Charley Brewster (Anton Yelchin) makes the connection between Jerry's suspicious activity and a steadily rising body count, he vows to end the reign of terror next door. But he can't do it alone. His only hope is Las Vegas magician/vampire-slayer Peter Vincent (David Tennant). Together, this unlikely duo set out to end Jerry's evil rampage. But Jerry is a ruthless, relentless killer, and he's not going down without a fight. Get set to sink your teeth into this thrilling re-vamp of the terrifying horror classic. Fright Night will captivate you from the very first bite! The rating to this movie I am giving an 8/10, because this film deserve it and it was really enjoyable horror flick!

65,fernandoschiavi,"This Fright Night remake doesn't even reach the soles of the original's shoe; but, on your terms, it's decent fun",6,3 October 2021,"In the far-off 80's - not so far away for fans of the genre - horror was rehearsing its adolescence, with fun productions aimed at a younger audience, in an inverse process with what happened with science fiction: in the 50's to the 70's, spaceships and gigantic monsters led the youth to drive-ins, while the horror took charge of presenting mature arguments in plots that featured nudity, beautiful women and an adult cast, in charge of producers such as Hammer, Amicus and Universal. As the slashers established themselves with the birth of such legendary figures as Jason Voorhees, Freddy Krueger and, the eldest, Michael Myers.At a time when vampires were becoming younger - Vamp (1986), The Lost Boys (1985) and Near Dark (1987) -, Tom Holland's A Hora do Amazon blended the protagonists' youth with experience from Roddy McDowall and Chris Sarandon to exactly refer to the old style films, rescuing the figure of Van Helsing, the gothic mansion and the hunters. Among so many useless remakes that have appeared in recent years, Fright Night seemed like a good bet. The 1985 original is a lot of fun, but it doesn't survive the time as well - it's hard for the new generation to accept it - so an updated version would be an interesting bet. In part, Craig Gillespie's film works well with the changes made to the original story, but on the other hand, it fails to build a new structure.The idea of making a remake officially started in mid-2007, when names like Heath Ledger, who died in January 2008, were tipped to act in the production. Colin Farrell was reluctant to play Jerry, but belatedly accepted because he needed the job and had enjoyed director Craig Gillespie's performance in The Dream Girl (2007). As for the script, written by Marti Noxon (I Am Number Four and 23 episodes of the series Buffy, The Vampire Slayer), the proposal from the beginning was to make it with as little influence as possible from the original film. To sum up, it's possible to say that the remake really isn't bad. There are good ideas there, but they get lost in comparisons to the original, a much better movie, more fun, well done and interesting. The new A Hora do Amazanto will be easily forgotten in the coming years, mainly due to the weak special effects and some bad solutions of the script, since the masterpiece from 1985 will always be consulted and appreciated.In the plot, Charley is a 17-year-old who discovers that his neighbor Jerry is a wild vampire. Faced with the threat and constant disappearances, he tries to protect his family and get rid of the guy, with the help of the illusionist Peter Vincent. From the synopsis, we see that the basic premise of the original remains almost untouched, but we have good changes. For example, the setting was switched to Las Vegas, an inspired choice given the city's bustling nightlife and the amount of bizarreness at casinos and shows. The characters also appear slightly different; Charley (well incorporated by the charismatic Anton Yeltchin) appears a little more arrogant than William Ragsdale in the original, presenting a tense relationship between his character and Christopher Mintz-Plasse (Ed, far more vulnerable than Stephen Geoffreys's), focusing a shaken friendship that appears well worked by the script.But don't worry vampire lovers (the real ones, not the glittery version of Twilight), because screenwriter Marti Noxon respects the ""rules"" of creature mythology well: no reflections in mirrors, fear of crucifixes, fangs... The package complete. Without the Twilight inventions, which, by the way, is satirized with a great joke. In times when the definitive predators of mythology turned into romantic emos, Fright Night rescues bloodsucking values that deserve to be remembered. ""He's the shark in Shark,"" explains the Mintz-Plasse character (who looks straight out of Lost Boys, another classic from a different era). If Fright Night presents any relevant modification to the vampire myth, it's Jerry's appreciation for a good beer... And who assumes all the powers and responsibilities is the great Colin Farrell, who is very comfortable as Jerry, showing off an amusing funny throughout the projection (which many even say works better than Chris Sarandon's version - which has a small part here).Another key part of the original is Peter Vincent. If he was once portrayed by the great Roddy McDowall as a lovable and elegant guy, here the vampire and dark arts expert is a slovenly slob who looks like Chriss Angel but works thanks to an inspired performance by David Tennant. However, it is difficult to accept the reasons that make him help Charley, which are little justified and lazily explored. As in the original feature, Peter, a wealthy collector of rare items, doesn't believe Charley at first. However, he ends up being convinced by a photo taken at Jerry's home and thanks to a fact that happened in the past, something involving his parents. However, it takes a little longer for the artist to decide to do something against the enemy, as there would still be time for a chase along the roads and the appearance of a vampire Ed in scenes that brought blood and dismemberment, and digital effects that diminished the quality of the production.There are good moments in the new version of The Hour of Amazement. In one of them, started after a strategic act by Jerry, Scooby's gang - the writer's reference to the series Buffy - flees the residence after an explosion and, in a single shot, confronts the villain along the roads, escaping the toss of a motorcycle and a vehicle crash. This scene - inspired by Children of Hope - became even more special thanks to the illustrious tip of Chris Sarandon, when he decides to stop to check the accident. The actor could have been offered the role of Peter Vincent... In addition to the exaggerated CGI, the film also loses point for presenting a simple story of vampire and murder. In the original, the spectator was terrified by a zombie, a werewolf, the bat and an Amy with a frightening maw - in one of the most striking images of the production and which was also used in the movie poster and served as the muse of Boca do Inferno in his early years. The new Amy appears like that too, but without the slightest impact, as well as the other vampires that appear to disrupt the saga of heroes.Another serious problem is rhythm. It's great that Noxon changed a lot of things from the original by Tom Holland, but this one had a much more relevant order of facts than this new version, as it worked well with creating suspense and preparing a climax. Gillespie's film is very stylish (the director works exceptionally with sequels, especially in the car scene that ""honorifies"" Children of Hope), but unrestrained and poorly worked in several moments - like, for example, the vampire transformation of one of the characters - besides sounding artificial in its conclusion.The empty script, in which situations with the potential for interesting development in metaphors for adolescence and responsibility, is lost in the action scenes of the slow third act. More elaborate solutions, however, in this case seem curiously unnecessary, such is the fun that this horror, which revisits simpler times, offers. If it doesn't present anything intelligent, at least the production doesn't offend or seeks to be something more than it could effectively be. Less sexual than the original (it's a Disney movie, after all), the feature has an interesting, comedic horror tone that was so common 20 years ago and seems forgotten today. It's just fun to watch and these two aspects, the scares and the jokes, are well balanced.As for the technical part, I point out as successes the photography of Javier Aguirresarobe, who efficiently works the dark tones and nightscapes of Las Vegas, and the exciting soundtrack by Ramin Djawadi, which combines sinister chords (like a nostalgic keyboard that goes straight back to the horrors of the 80s) with some more contemporary ones. From errors, we have terrible visual effects, which appear badly done and exaggerated, while 3D is only useful for throwing blood off the screen, darkening the projection too much. Aside from a scene where sparks dance across the screen with a very nice effect and a few seconds of climax against the vampire, the dark and desaturated tones of the film simply ruin the three-dimensionality. At many times it is even difficult to discern what is happening.Replacing Richard Edlund's efficient make-up and effects, with a computer graphics less impactful because it is more fictional, and giving contemporary air to the characters, Fright Night doesn't even reach the soles of the original's shoe; but, on your terms, it's decent fun. Even though it has flaws in its structure, Fright Night is great fun and, like the original, it balances humorous moments with genuine horror. The entire cast deserves applause for their charismatic work, and director Craig Gillespie shows great talent in the visual composition of the narrative.",Fright Night
66,witster18,refreshing remake...,7,18 December 2011,"It's refreshing in the sense that it did not completely copy or degrade the original work. Sure, many elements are the same, but the remake of Fright Night is not only a good remake; it's better than the original.Now, I realize that this is 6.6 here, and the original is 6.9, but I still think this is a clear cut above the original. The fact that it IS a remake is probably the only thing keeping it from exceeding its' predecessor in terms of score.The two things that really set this remake apart for me were the art direction, and the casting. Both were exceptional. I knew from the moment the film spelled out Fright Night that somebody cared about this one.Anton Yelchin is perfect for the lead role. He has the perfect balance of charm and nerdiness. He caught my eye with his strong performance in ""Charlie Bartlett"", and I don't think the casting director could have picked anyone better for this role. The same goes for Toni Collete as the single mother, and Colin Farrell as the vampire.David Tennant is also perfect for his role of Peter Vincent. They put a little spin on the role that added a little light-hearted-ness(something also present in the first film). And Imogen Poots is the perfect hotty to play the girlfriend(a HUGE improvement over Amanda Bearse in EVERY way). Amanda Bearse has never been the best actress, and she always seemed to really annoy me on screen. There's a reason she always plays the 'unlikable/annoying neighbor or girlfriend.. Poots isn't just a hotty - she comes off as genuine and likable here. This time around the audience actually cares about the girlfriend. It's an added bonus that we can have scenes here that involve the girlfriend, the mom, and the lead in harrowing situations together. That's something we didn't get in the original. There are other significant, welcome changes. One is the 'number' of vampires, and the other is the fate of Peter Vincent.There is one scene in particular where Farrell is trying to get invited into Charlie's house, and the interaction between the character's is fantastic. It's realistic. It's an improvement over the original. It's well-written.There isn't much to gripe about here other than maybe the climax of the film isn't quite as thrilling and effective as the films first 75 minutes. The only thing the original has on this is 'camp', and I really don't see how that makes it better. It just makes the original a product of the mid-80's, and a bit cheesy. There's nothing cheesy about this remake. This one is worth adding to the collection. Stands with ""Let Me In"" as one of the best of these 'remakes', and this is by far the best of the 70's/80's horror remakes.73/100You'll like this if you liked:Disturbia, Fright Night(orig), Near Dark, and The Lost Boys.I think the nitpicker reviews are hilarious. One said, ""all the kids are absent/missing from school and the police don't notice""... laughable... the point was that the kids were disappearing at a fast clip... not to mention they're kids.. missing class... omg. The nitpick reviews on this title in particular are funnier than the movie.This film has style - especially considering it's shoe-string budget(at least by today's standards). I figure after they paid Collette and Farrell - they probably had about the same amount invested as the original.Recommended for all those except nitpickers and 10/10 cult-followers of the original. It wasn't very scary or funny, but it was pretty darn entertaining.",Fright Night
67,deatman9,Cant beat the original,5,10 November 2012,This movie was not all bad but after the original you cant even really compare the two. This one was just not where near as good the story line was not as good or the actors and it was just not even the least bit creepy it was just boring.This movie is about a young boy who suspects his neighbour might be a vampire. So he enlists the help of peter vincent a magician (yes i said that right a magician) to help him kill the vampire.This one is just bad compared to the original the writing is bad the story is bad and its poorly directed.

68,Christian_Dimartino,A lot of fun!,9,29 December 2011,"What a year Colin Farrell has had! I hadn't seen him in a while, and in one year he comes back with Horrible Bosses, where he stole maybe not the whole show but he stole the moments he was in. Then after that he was in Fright night, which he only did, apparently, because he was bored.The film is a remake of an 80's B-movie with the same title. The film revolves around Charley(Anton Yelchin), a suburban teen who finds out that his neighbor Jerry(Farrell) is a vampire, and enlists the help of Peter Vincent(non other than the brilliant Dr. Who actor David Tennant), a Chris Angel based character, to help him.I have never really liked Yelchin. I liked him as Charlie Bartlett, but besides that I can't find a whole lot in him. But this is not his movie. The film belongs to Farrell and Tennant, who really steal the show here. Every moment with them is a lot of fun.Actually, almost every moment was a lot of fun. It feels like the film really stays on it's feet most of the way through. It just keeps throwing things at you left and right, like Scream 4(the year's best horror movie). Well, it's been a good year for horror(Scream 4, Insidious among the best, and Fright Night), and Romantic comedy(Midnight in Paris, Crazy Stupid love), two genres that usually fail. Well, I'll see you in 2012.A-",Fright Night
69,LazySod,Good popcorn fun,7,17 October 2011,Remakes of classics usually end up being pants. Every once in a while though some comes through holding up to their original counter part - or at least enough to be worthy of cinema time.Fright Night is one of these. It's a typical vampire story where one person detects the unbelievable truth and then needs to repair the damage before it gets really out of hand. It has a very nice pace and doesn't wait long with making sure everyone knows who is who and where things are going - it's as predictable as the average soap opera but it plays out fun.Adding to that the fact that it doesn't take itself serious and you can add good bits of laughter to the otherwise gruesome effect of having people close to you being hassled by a vampire and you not being able to do much about it. It rolls on and never looses track and all in all its highly enjoyable.7 out of 10 bite marks on the neck,Fright Night
70,doctorsmoothlove,Fright Night 2011,4,11 September 2011,"Fast-forwarding to 2011, both slasher cycles have ended and vampires have risen from their graves into pop culture saturation. Tom Holland probably never envisioned a world where his nostalgia would be so relevant. Eighties worship, as unwarranted as it is, is huge right now, so making a new Fright Night as inevitable as it is unwarranted. The original movie was fueled by Holland's personal interest in updating his beloved genre and forced to be creative by its tight budget. Today, it's an enjoyable if underwhelming effort that's just good enough to not need to be remade.So, is there any reason to watch the new Fright Night? For the majority of viewers, the answer is a terse ""no."" The seasoned movie-goer may find it another example of how to downgrade a superior film by placing it through the meat grinder of pedestrian production. The new film regurgitates the original's plot, adding unnecessary secondary characters while keeping the perfunctory subplots of the original. The flavorful parts of the original like Charlie's silent preliminary observations of Jerry have been streamlined into arriving at the action sooner. The movie feels cobbled together, the result of its poor editing, into a visual summary of its inspiration.What results from this process is the kind of stale movie the original would have been had Holland not spiced up the screenplay. Writer Marti Noxon attempts to add some humor by including putrid pop cultural jabs at Twilight that have no place in the narrative. Seeing as this is a Dreamworks release, I guess should have expected them. And if that weren't lame enough, Noxon actually manages to completely destroy the original's subtext. Charlie begins the story as a geek-turned-average guy who must be emasculated by his too-hot-for-me girlfriend Amy. The rest of the film is his heteronormative redemption by putting Amy into her distressed place and kicking butt. Even Jerry has been updated as brusque Blade-like baddie. At least casting Colin Farrell gives the role, ironically like the first film, some unintentional charm. Farrell can poke fun at his playboy lifestyle nicely, if he only had a better screenplay The original Fright Night's plot may have been followed though its humor wasn't. Unless you are homophobic, you aren't going to laugh very much. So, we have a redundant copy of an original that wasn't even that pleasant itself. Farrell gets a chuckle now and then, but only those people who refuse to watch older films will enjoy this one.Not Recommended.",Fright Night
71,richieandsam,A very average movie.,5,22 February 2014,"FRIGHT NIGHTYet another remake. The movie is a typical vampire film and unfortunately it has nothing special about it.I did like it, it was a lot of fun to watch but give it a couple of months and I will have forgotten all about it. There was nothing that really stuck out in this film, but then I felt the same way about the original. I liked the original movies, but thinking back at them now I don't remember anything about them apart from the front cover of the VHS that I had.The effects were average. At times you could clearly tell that it was computer generated. The vampires did look really good though.The action was alright too... but again, nothing I have not seen a million times before.The acting was not too bad. The movie stars Anton Yelchin, Colin Farrell, Toni Collette, Imogen Poots and David Tennant. The best character in the movie was Peter Vincent who was played by David Tennant﻿. David did a great job and was by far the best actor in the movie, he also had the best character to play which probably helped.Don't let this review put you off the film. It is a good film, just don't expect a future classic. It is a good film to watch with friends... you can talk while the film is on and you don't have to worry too much about missing an essential part of the film.I will give this film 5 out of 10.""

72,hellholehorror,Lifeless,4,1 October 2021,"Mostly I don't like exposition but sometimes you need something to explain character motivations, the film just jumps in assuming you know that the neighbour is a vampire, I honestly thought I had accidentally skipped 5 minutes of the film and had to check. It makes no sense as some parts of the film had me rolling my eyes with how boring or stupid the character and director decisions were. There are a handful of exciting moments and cool ideas but this is always juxtaposed with boredom. Not as memorable as the original film, a weaker remake on all fronts except technical, even that they don't always get right, some of the CGI looks fake (especially the awfully directed pretentious 'long take' whilst they are driving the car). The vampire hunter and nerd are the only interesting characters. A few good scenes cannot save a lifeless film.",Fright Night
73,skybrick736,Fright Night,6,24 January 2015,"Fright Night is a remake from an underrated 1985 horror gym that doesn't get near the praise it should. However, I watched the remake open minded and was pleased with a lot of new elements to the movie. There are a few nice plot twists and I really liked the main leads especially Colin Farrell and Imogen Poots. I liked that it was a bit more modern and that the setting took place in Las Vegas. It set up nicely the fact that Peter Vincent's magic show was one of the famous Vegas highlights. The movie has a few flaws though one being a poor job on character development for the three friends, which I thought they could have extended a few scenes on in the beginning. Also, it was a huge bummer seeing the fake computer generated vampire effects. That was a huge turnoff that made me say ""UGH!"" out loud a few times. The Fright Night remake (6/10) is not total rubbish but it's really nothing to seek out.",Fright Night
74,p-jonsson,Okay but not fantastic,6,3 January 2014,"I have to admit that I have not seen the original but from this version of Fright Night I must say that I do not understand all the fuss and why it has become somewhat of a cult classic. I give 6 stars out of 10 and that is quite frankly just barely. If someone had told me that this was a high-budget TV-movie I would not have been very surprised. Maybe it felt more fresh in 1985 when the original came out.The first part of the movie is actually a bit boring. However, after the vampire finally reveals himself so that Charlie's girlfriend and mother starts to believe him things starts to pick up pace a bit. Unfortunately a lot of the movie is still somewhat mediocre. There are the usual frustrating moments, which Hollywood seems to believe must be in every movie, where Charlie just stupidly stands and stares wasting time, drops his weapon etc. etc.The special effects are okayish but never great. The ""vampire hunter"" Peter Vincent is just a jerk most of the time until the very end when he shapes up a bit.It is a decent enough evening diversion but as I wrote, as far as I am concerned, it gets an ""okay"" but just barely.",Fright Night

79,theinaniloquent,"""You can't run from evil if it lives next door""",8,18 February 2012,"A teenager suspects that his new neighbor is a vampire.I've never seen the original, so if your suspecting a review comparing the two (which I never do) stick along. Fright Night seemed to be an average movie. I never seen anything about it but the trailer, which made it seem like a teenage-popcorn flick, which I really hate. So with this, I sat down with NO expectations and had no idea what I was getting myself into. The beginning started off like a cheap slasher but soon evolved into something much better, and it was awesome. If your not into fun flicks, that don't serve purpose (most don't) then your probably going to be questioning your viewing. Otherwise, I suggest you take a spin. The acting in this movie was good. It wasn't OUTSTANDING or anything like that, but it felt real, if that makes sense. He made it believable and THIS is how vampires are supposed to be. I'm thankful that the vampires didn't sparkle and fall in love with humans, they wanted blood; their main desire. Thank you, Craig Gilliespie. The most notable was Colin Ferrell, who did his part playing the vampire. I enjoyed the directing. For the director's third movie, he did well. The movie was actually, surprisingly, hilarious. I didn't expect this, because I came in expecting a vampire slasher, but I was taken by surprise. The scenes know when and where to place a joke and a suspenseful scene, and the editing they placed was great. Last, but not least, we have the occasional flaws. They weren't intentional, but were annoying, in my opinion. They were added for extra comedic effect, but they're easily passable. If your not to hard on movies, and don't look for deeper meaning, and love to be entertained; RECOMMENDED! This was some of the most fun I've had with a movie, and I'm sure it will be for you to. I have 99 problems, but this movie ain't one. 8/10.",Fright Night
80,brefane,Vampires and this movie both suck,1,24 August 2011,"Dull, pointless, and charmless remake of a good-natured, mildly amusing film from the '80s. The 2011 Fright Night aims low and misses. The 3-D, featuring spattered blood, shattered glass and sparks, is more distracting than necessary. Jerry, the vampire-next-door, is not an original or distinctive adversary despite Farrell's appeal. Jerry does little to hide his unnatural existence, doesn't put his supernatural powers to any real use, and there is only a sketchy explanation of how this creature lives and dies. Plot points never amount to anything, the editing is often confusing, and the actions and reactions of the characters aren't convincing. Why doesn't the nerd attack his former tormentors with his vampiric powers? Why doesn't the family call the police when the vampire begins tearing up their yard? Virtually every character was shown using a wireless device in the first 15 minutes of the film. And why drive pointlessly into the desert to escape, and then call 911 at a place where you can't get service!? You may also wonder why a vampire would move into a neighborhood with houses one right next to the other. Long, noisy, fiery battles with creatures coming out of the earth are apparently ignored by neighbors who live within a stone's throw; the police and firefighters never show. The leads are dreary and flat, and since nearly everyone is clueless there's nothing at stake.",Fright Night

Colin Farrell plays a good Jerry Dandrige but he doesn't compare to Chris Sarandon in the original. Worth watching but its nothing to write home about.

First off I have to say that when I saw the trailer at first for this film, I quickly attacked the film and went on like a broken record: ""How could they remake a classic and blah blah blah"". After watching the trailer many more times for my benefit, I decided to go tonight to watch the film with my cousin. And what a Frightening treat we got out of this.This remake surprisingly blends in some psychological themes, many supernatural elements, intense action, gruesome blood, excellent comedy and some scary horror tactics. People this is another remake to me which is never bad nor just a decent one, it's another remake that's in ""One of the better Remakes section"". It's up there with TCM 03, Dawn of the Dead 04 and Hills Have Eyes 06, naming a few.This remake works: It has some talented actors who don't flop much, many intense moments, comedic dialog and some excellent scenes of action. The story is kept mostly the same with a boy wondering if his next door neighbor is vampire. I'm gonna do a few comparisons to the original though, it only being fair.I loved the original film and I was peed-off when I saw and heard about it. But seeing this was a big change and a surprisingly good one which was able to follow the story but working on it's terms.WARNING: THIS PART CONTAINS SOME SPOILERS!!!! The Charlie character was a big believer of vampires in the original while as here he is just a normal teen living his own life, and minding is own business. His buddy Ed was an annoying twit while as here, he was tempted to get rid of Jerri. Peter Vincent was more stern and stale in the original and he was very sensitive. Here he is just plain funny with the drunk-git attitude and funny sense of mind. Amy is more a less the same in both versions, maybe just a bit more hyped and all than the original's. Charlie's mum is more hot-headed and out of control while as the original mummy had no idea what was going on. And as for Jerri, the original's was more charming and cheese. He was motivated to turn into the horrible soul at any time. The new Jerri is far more dangerous, sadistic and more brutal.Most of scenes were similar though changed and kept at different paces to make the rest of the film flow.This film also has more sexual references, nudity and over the top language which was a big difference.Anyway it's definitely worth the scene to check out. One of the better remakes in my opinion. If they could do a top notch job on Fright Night, Hopefully remaking Holland's other classic ""Child's Play"" won't be a prob.

86,By-TorX-1,"Watchable, but the Fangs are Blunt Compared to the Sharper Original",6,3 May 2017,"Fright Night 2011 is not a bad film, but it is not a great film, and it is a pale imitation of the original 1985 cult classic. When producing a remake, an obvious pressure is to make changes and appeal to a current crowd, and there lies the problem with Fright Night 2011 - there is no mystery. The charm of the original is Charley's gradual suspicion of what should not be - that his next-door neighbour is a vampire - and the obvious disbelief his fears elicit in all he tells. In the remake there is no real build up, we see a vampire attack from the outset and it is Ed who reveals the vampire, in one clumsy lets-get-on-with-it info-dump, and so Charley merely becomes a slayer. Colin Farrell is an actor who is not devoid of charisma, but he doesn't nail Chris Sarandon's urbane and hypnotic charm (and even more so when he becomes a CGI vamp), while David Tennant's Peter Vincent is less Roddy McDowell (but who could match the peerless Mr. McDowell?) and more of a fusion of Russell Brand and Captain Jack Sparrow. Furthermore, the 2011 version of Vincent fails due to a weird quirk revealed later in the film. This is so because when Charley first comes to the great magician he is greeted with mockery and rejection, so far, so as with the original, but then we later learn that Vincent's mother was the victim of a vampire, so why would he be so quick to disbelieve and dismiss Charley? He knows, all too tragically, that vampires exist, so why not at least question the lad before giving him the elbow? This is, of course, for dramatic purposes, but it sets off an unravelling of the plot when Peter's story is revealed and then pondered upon as Vincent's scepticism makes no sense, and so only further draws an unfavourable comparison with the charm of the original.",Fright Night
87,JimmyCollins,Not perfect but a fun take on the vampire genre.,6,21 September 2011,"I vaguely remember seeing the original fright night from the 80's and being somewhat unimpressed, so i was surprised when i heard of a remake in the works, however i was happy to see that the remake is, like a lot of remakes, really just a similar story with a known name slapped on it to try and sell more tickets.This movie is far from perfect but it is a lot of fun, thanks a great deal to the absolutely hilarious David Tennant who in my opinion totally stole the show, and also the newly hilarious Colin Farrell, who is a great comic both in this and in Horrible Bosses.The rest of the cast is good also, Anton Yelchin is fast becoming my favourite male actor, he's got great charisma about him which is nice to see in the tribe of young Hollywood heartthrobs, his nerdiness really makes you care about the characters he is playing, i look forward to seeing lots more of him in the future, Toni Collette seems somewhat out of place but her role is minor so its not such a big deal but what she does do is great as usual. The only thing i had a problem with regarding the cast was Imogen Poots, at the beginning of the film her American accent was kinda bad, i picked up a lot of English in there but as the film progressed it became unnoticeable.The story line is basically Disturbia with a vampire as the neighbour, so its quite easy to watch, one thing i found a little annoying is a lot of the scenes are far too long, it seemed as though some scenes just went forever, but again towards the end it fastened up so i cant get too annoyed about that. The modern take on the 80's vampire genre is quite a good one.Like i said, it has its flaws, but it is quite enjoyable. :)",Fright Night
88,Minus_The_Beer,"A Remake That Doesn't Completely, For Lack of a Better Word, Suck.",6,13 January 2013,"For those who remember it, Tom Holland's 1985 vampire cult classic ""Fright Night"" is truly something special. Like most beloved cinematic nuggets, a remake was only a matter of time. Enter Craig Gillespie's ""Fright Night,"" a modern update of a story that encapsulated an era of horror movies, recalling a time when movie monsters were as much fun as they were frightening. Boasting a solid cast with the likes of Anton Yelchin, David Tennant, Toni Collette, Christopher ""McLovin"" Mintz-Plasse and Colin Farrell, this remake starts off with the best of intentions, even if its execution leaves a little something to be desired.Built on the basic framework of Holland's original story, the details of this ""Fright Night"" are pretty familiar. Likable yet slightly nerdy Charley Brewster (Yelchin) lives in the vanilla landscape of the suburbs (this time in the Las Vegas desert) with his single mother (Collette). Trouble comes to town when his neighbor, the charming Jerry Dandridge (Farrell), turns out to be a blood-thirsty vampire. In an effort to keep his mother -- as well as his hot-to-trot girlfriend (Imogen Poots) and his jaded former best bud ""Evil"" Ed (McLovin) -- out of danger, he teams up with washed-up vampire hunter/entertainer Peter Vincent (Tennant) and sets his sights on breaking into Jerry's bachelor pad and crashing his late-night party.Similar to 2011's ""The Thing"" prequel/remake, this incarnation of ""Fright Night"" seems to have most of the ingredients for a good time in place, but unfortunately suffers from an overwhelming familiarity (admittedly a problem with most remakes). Even though this particular remake distances itself a bit from the original in certain aspects, it still hits the same basic beats as the original, which sucks a lot of the would-be intensity out of the room. Also, like the aforementioned ""Thing,"" this re-do boasts an awful lot of bad CGI blood and guts that may very well have looked fine in 3D, but which doesn't serve the film very well. On the upside, all the players on hand are game and the film moves at a relatively easy pace that builds its characters as it gives way to the obligatory chase scenes. There's also a cameo midway through the film that fans of the original film will relish. All the right components are in place for this film to be one of the least offensive (and, in turn, better) remakes in recent memory (and really, it is) but it doesn't quite fire on all cylinders, making for a film that works on the surface, but ultimately isn't a patch on its source material.In the end, ""Fright Night"" is a wholly unnecessary yet admittedly entertaining remake. When one thinks of modern remakes, there are worse efforts that come to mind. Forgiven its flaws, this re-telling of a true cult classic gets the job done with minimal damage. Those who consider the original to be sacred would be best advised to steer clear, but those seeking a fun vampire romp minus the glitter could do much worse. If nothing else, it will inspire anyone who watches it to dust off a copy of the 1985 original and give it a spin (some for the hundredth time, many for the first), and there's absolutely nothing wrong with that.",Fright Night
89,Michael-Hallows-Eve,A very well done 'Remake'.,8,17 July 2012,"This film (obviously a remake) for me was well executed and visually well done. I know a lot of people hate remakes (and yes some of them should have never been made), but I actually liked this one. It had very good effects and the cast was great I thought, with a cool cameo from the original 'Jerry' Chris Sarandon. I thought Colin Farrell actually played the part of 'Jerry' well too. The blood and kill scenes were well done (yes some of them were CGI but it worked) and the story kind of kept to the original too (apart from the 'Peter Vincent' back story, which was obviously updated to fit the 'Vegas setting). So overall I give this an 8 out of 10.",Fright Night
90,piratecannon,Bite Me,7,27 December 2012,"The original Fright Night—which was released in 1985—is a cornerstone in the B-grade vampire movie catalog. It's hysterical, gruesome, and completely self aware. With the newly released reboot, the concern seemed to be centered on whether or not this was going to be a ""serious""' go at an already familiar storyline. Thankfully, director Craig Gillespie is able to put together a nicely crafted horror flick that lets its audience in on thefor lack of a better word ""yucks.""Fright Night is kind of like The 'Burbs. In my opinion, it's not nearly as funny, but its suburban setting makes it in an admittedly eerie way familiar. Like Disturbia, it effectively plays on the unspoken suspicion that just about all us have—there's something really weird going on next door. In this case, Charlie Brewster (Yelchin) is made aware of the fact that his new neighbor, Jerry (Farrell), is a vampire. As you'd expect, he initially laughs off this assertion as nonsense. After witnessing the blood-sucking man-demon feed on the lady-down-the- street, however, he realizes just how uncool the new stud muffin next door really is. A series of events leads to an inevitable confrontation between Jerry, Charlie, and a drunken ""vampire expert"" named Peter Vincent (who has his very own goth-heavy extravaganza—centered, of course, on vampires—on the Vegas strip). A particularly nice addition to the cast is Christopher Mintz-Plasse (Superbad, Kick-Ass), who plays the dork-who-knows-exactly-what's-going-on to a T. There's an especially humorous moment later in the movie where well heck, I don't want to ruin it, but if you've seen the 1985 version you'll know what's coming.I was able to catch this in 3D/Real D ( which is it?) and, I have to say, though the effects are sometimes gimmicky, there is an immersive feeling to the production. For the most part, it's pure popcorn cheese, but you'll find yourself having much more fun than you likely anticipated.In the end, Fright Night doesn't really add anything all that fresh to vampire lore, but it doesn't need to. It's meant to be fast, stupid thrills. And it is.With buckets of blood thrown in for good measure.",Fright Night
91,jburtonprod-802-759029,Really Shouldn't Have Been Called 'Fright Night',7,9 October 2016,"Edit: While I still believe all the things I said below this movie has grown on me due to the late Anton Yelchin, Imogen Poots and Toni Collette's performances. My outrage has died at this being another movie who's memory has been defiled by the 'let's do a remake and make worse than the original' crowd. The relationships have enough charm to have made this something a 'comfort food movie' for me. Here's to the memory of Anton. Wish he had lived longer. It seems like this movie was written by somebody whose top priority was to defy expectations. The result is a forced and unnatural movie that features the same title and character names of the original 'Fright Night' with none of it's wit, scares, charm or taut plot structure. The first 'Fright Night' was akin to a chess match. This one is more like roller derby. They really should have just called it some other title and invested more into the new plot and character development. That being said, on it's own, it's still a slightly above average Horror/Vampire flick.The late Anton Yelchin (sad face) is good as Charley and there is a talented cast of Colin Farrel, Toni Collette and Imogen Poots (new crush). I guess anybody who has played Dr. Who is supposed to be a genius but I thought this David Tennant dude, was a dud. Roddy McDowell lent so much more class and zeal to the role. I thought Farrel would have been great but where Chris Sarandon provided an air of mystery, depth and seeming enjoyment in being a vampire, Farrell just comes across as some guy who needs to suck blood to stay alive.The attempt to make the story more contemporary, like making the two love interests more sexually savvy, seemed to be jaded and uncomfortable. Also the 'Evil' character isn't given any of the great stuff the kid did in the original and just comes across sad. They even set up the possibility of a redemptive moment for two former friends who have grown apart and then don't deliver. The role of the Vampire's 'familiar', which added more humor and another foe to deal with is cut. They also totally sh!tcanned the Vampire and Amy 'love' plot line that drove the entire 3rd act. The dance club seduction scene that worked so well is reduced to what appears to be lewd make out session in the middle of crowded club. No romance, no mystery and nothing to drive the plot.The vampire 'does and don't' just seemed jumbled and unintelligible unlike the original where there were rules and the breaking or revealing of new rules.All the great special effects makeup of Steve Johnson in the original is now computer aided graphics and pretty lifeless at that. The penultimate shot of Farrel at the end is embarrassing.It's not all bad, hence the 5.5 of 10 rating but I can't think of a single scene or sequence in this movie that is superior or even equal to the original.Hollywood needs to stop with the remake crap and buy some new scripts.",Fright Night
92,Vincent_B,Build Up for a Let Down,5,30 December 2014,"I am not going to compare this movie to the original release, simply because the original film was there first before the remake. Everyone likes originality. This movie fails all on its own. The vampire kills his local neighbors. Where was this vampire on day one of ""vampire 101"" class? Every decent vampire out there knows you hunt victims away from home and bring them to your lair. You don't incite the neighbors with dumpsters. Above all else you don't stare at people like you are some serial killer pedophile stalker. That is all he does in the film is stare at them.About 90% of the movie is just suspense moments and I would file it under suspense, not comedy and not horror. Nothing very funny happens, nothing real scary occurs, and the action (if you call it that) is in the last 20 to 30 minutes of the film. Touchstone is Disney so it is vampire with lite-horror moments. Honestly if they toned it down they could of got the PG-13 rating they were shooting for in the first place.The only redeeming character was the spoof on Chris Angel. He didn't have a highly original role or background just the only one I cared about. Maybe the actor was just that good he could pull it off, but the rest of the cast I wouldn't give a job working on a TV commercial or maybe their role was too thin. Christopher Mintz-Plasse and Dave Franco was in the movie all too brief, so I really can't tell you anything from a cameo performances.I didn't care for Colin Farrell's acting at all. It seemed like any moment, he was just going to pull a tub out in the middle of the neighborhood and bath in blood. He may not have been so bold as to state he was a vampire but he gave off creeper vibes every time he talked to people. The only interesting scene was him blowing up the house in a very unique way.The movie by itself is just your below average vampire picture.",Fright Night
93,80sHorror,At last a decent remake! (And yes i love the classic of 80's),10,25 March 2012,"So the truth is I loved the original back in the 80's and thought oh no not another remake! However sitting down watching it after only about 5-10 minutes started to thoroughly enjoy it.FrightNight is a remake, with a difference. (It comes in 3D as well if u wish). Based on the original Fright Night, but with a few differences, for once the vampire is not in love with his lunch....now there is a turn up for the books! Las Vegas neighbour hood people start to disappear as Colin Farrell (Jerry) moves in next door. Hes broody in his character because hes a Vampire! (Some reviewers really need to see bigger picture and step away from Twilight and the original FrightNight, as there are some differences). Brewster has to step in and save the day, armed with stakes and crossbow he enlists the help of Vincent,(David Tennent)who is a Las Vegas magician. The film gets 5 stars as its a little different from the original, however still maintains its story line without the kissy kissy bits! Both Farrell and Tennent steal the show, putting in a good performance, even the original vampire from FrightNight (Chris Sarradon) has a small role to play in the film, no hints for spotting him. (spoiler alert..hes the guy who rear ends their car!)There are lots of similarities between the original, for example, in one the vampire trashes Brewsters car, in this one, he trashes the motorbike...well, lobs it anyhow! The banter between Vincent (Tennent) and Brewster is funny, there are enough teeth shots, gore shots to keep any vampire fan happy. I would recommend this film in a heart beat, it contains everything a horror fan would enjoy.",Fright Night
94,ksj870,Poor Remake Of An 80s Classic,3,28 June 2012,"Some of you may recall a dark little gem of a movie from 1985 called Fright Night. Nearly as funny as it was scary, Fright Night took the basic scenario from Rear Window and turned it into a vampire tale. What if, the story proposed, you discovered that your new neighbor was one of the undead? Would anybody believe you? And what would you do when the vampire came after you? The result was one of the finest horror films of the 80s, and one of the best vampire films ever. Fast forward to 2011 and the inevitable remake. Let's be clear, I don't inherently dislike remakes. I believe it is possible to take a good story and re-interpret it in a new and creative way. Occasionally, the remake is even better than the original.This is not one of those occasions.Directed by Craig Gillespie (who helmed the outstanding sleeper hit of 2007, Lars and the Real Girl), the 2011 Fright Night retains the basic plot from the original but changes things in all the wrong places. We still have a teenage boy who learns that his next door neighbor is a vampire, but everything else is a radical departure from the 1985 film. The original movie created a creepy, American Gothic sort of atmosphere and populated it with main characters that were easy to identify with. The filmmakers were obviously familiar with the old Hammer vampire classics and played off of the audience's undoubted familiarity with them as well. The humor was omnipresent but subtle and developed naturally from the dialogue and character interaction. And when it was time to be scary, it was scary indeed.The new film doesn't bother trying to be very Gothic, American or otherwise. Set in Las Vegas, of all places, the movie has a grungy feel to it which is probably intentional, even though it undercuts the film's mood more than once. Informed not by Hammer horror but by Buffy the Vampire Slayer and Twilight, the remake tries to appeal to fans of those stories while still trying to duplicate what succeeded so well in the original. It doesn't work, anymore than baking a cherry pie with coconuts would. Blech.More's the pity because the cast is absolutely outstanding: Anton Yelchin, David Tennant, Colin Farrell, Imogen Poots. Every one of them plays their part well, and for the most part they even seem to be enjoying themselves (especially Tennant, a renowned Shakespearean actor who here plays a very un-Shakespearean character). The thespian talent on hand should guarantee a good film, even with a bad script and questionable direction. But the cast's best efforts just aren't enough to overcome the weaknesses of the story itself.The final product isn't particularly scary, and the humor, though incessant, is generally too vulgar and unimaginative to ever really be funny. Even the special effects, heavily reliant on CGI, are inferior to those of the original. There's no reason why Fright Night 2011 had to be a bad movie, especially not with the incredible cast. Ironically, in their desire to resurrect a genre classic, the filmmakers took Fright Night and drained it of everything that gave it life.",Fright Night
95,rebecca-ry,Not The Best Film In The World,7,20 February 2012,"I haven't seen the original 'Fright Night' so I cannot compare it to anything. What I can say is that it's adequate, that's all.The acting is pretty good to be fair, Colin Farrell's villain role is played very well. Anton Yelchin and Imogen Poots' roles were also good. Christopher Mintz-Plasse was good but I was annoyed that he was playing - yet again - McLovin from 'Superbad', he just can't seem to escape that role and it would be nice to see what else he is capable of. However, I feel David Tennant stole the show with his performance and it would have been better if he had been in the film more often as he provided 90% of the comedy here. The comedic aspect of this film is what makes it good, I'm not saying it needed more laughs but there are moments where you are neither frightened or laughing. These dull bits are what weakens the film as a whole. It can be genuinely frightening in parts, making you jump quite a lot with great effects most of the time but in others it can be quite cartoon-like. Overall, I would not recommend this film as a film you HAVE to watch but I would also not advise anyone to specifically avoid it. It's average and it's ashame it is that because the performances and the storyline work, there was just something missing.",Fright Night
96,CountVladDracula,I loathe this movie,1,18 August 2011,"I loathe this movie. I can't even put into words how much I hated this movie so instead I will list ways I feel this film could have been improved. Pay attention because my view of this movie is revealed in the list.Ten things that would have improved this remake:1. Tom Holland as the writer or another writer familiar with Dracula style vampires. Even the writer of Dracula of 2000 or Van Helsing would have been better than Marti Noxon. 2. Respect for the intelligence of the audience. i.e. keeping Peter Vincent as a has-been horror actor who perhaps now has a web series as to modernize his position.3. Kept the shapeshifting abilities to become wolf, mist, bat, fly and enthrall minds because it's freaky and makes the vampires all the more powerful. There was no reason to strip them of most of their powers and add extra limitations to them.4. Leave the hint of humanity in that Jerry was looking for the look-a-like of a lost love. This gives a twinge of sympathy and also makes it all the more twisted and frightening when he does something evil because you're taken off guard. 5. Find a director who actually was a fan of the original and remembers it fondly and knows how to do Gothic atmosphere, who can make suburbs creepy, like Tim Burton or Del Toro. 6. Leave it set in the suburbs. Every country and state has suburbs. Most places don't have their own Vegas. 7. Make sure the hero is relatable and a decent human being. A self-absorbed tool who abandons friends for popularity just doesn't cut it.8. A better budget. Fifteen million is pocket change today by Hollywood standards.9. Knowledge of what is popular in the genre. The director and writer of this remake THINK things like Saw and Final destination are in and Gothic is old. Actually it's the opposite.The last Saw movie did poorly. Let me in did fairly well for what it was. And the Wolfman remake got an Oscar while Final destination five is struggling. Two Frankenstein films are in development, Dark Shadows is in production as is Harker, and Dracula 3D. Priest did well and Woman in Black is about to hit theaters. Slasher films are out. Gothic horror is back with a vengeance and the ones who made this remake are really out of touch to not know that.10. An effort to NOT appeal to any particular demographic. Notice how Tim Burton's films are always successful even when people complain about how formulaic they've become. He never tires to appeal to a demographic. He makes films that appeal to his own tastes and to Hell with what the studio thinks kids want today. Sleepy Hollow was going to be a generic, low budget slasher film with no romance or atmospehre but then Tim Burton got a hold of it and added the supernatural, added the love story, and added the Hammer Horror-esque atmosphere and he made it work where it would have failed. If Hollywood would just stop trying to condescend to what it thinks is a simple minded audience we might start getting quality horror films again. Some people are already trying and it's working. This film is not.",Fright Night
97,kols,Generation Gap,1,7 May 2013,"The only things shared between Fright Night 2011 and Fright Night 1985 are a few plot elements and the names; otherwise, they're two completely different movies, coming from two completely different traditions.First, the title: in Fright Night 1985 it referred to the horror movies local TV stations would air at 11 or 12 on Friday or Saturday nights and some TV stations still do. In Fright Night 2011, it refers to nothing except Fright Night 1985.Then there's Charley - in the original, he's introduced as a blank that fills out as the plot unfolds. In 2011, he's immediately portrayed as a smart-assed High School Kid, defining the tradition this movie comes from, Teenagers as Idiot Jerks movies, i.e., Hostel.And then there's Amy. In the 1985 version, she begins as a kind of girl friend/sidekick. In the Nightclub scene she blossoms into a sexy seductee. In 2011, she's just kind of there, no particular energy.Amanda Bearse's Amy, particularly as she is taken by Chris Sarandon's Dandrige, highlights the difference between the two movies. 2011 has nothing of the smoldering sensuality of her seduction or her simpering misery once it was accomplished.Another big difference, Roddy Mcdowall's Peter Vincent is absent, partially replaced by a Las Vegas magician who appears half-way through and bears no resemblance to his namesake.Likewise, Chris Sarandon's Dandrige is a tour de force performance; Collin Farrell's character may have the same name but bears no similarity. More than anything else, however is the focus and pace of both movies. The original has a tight focus, the camera rarely strays more ten feet away from the characters. 2011 rarely gets within five feet of them. The original orchestrates its pacing to full dramatic effect while 2011 just kind of rolls the camera without trying to establish any particular pace. This is, again, an example of the two traditions.There's a great deal more that could be said and many of the reviews document chapter and verse but, for me, the big point is that 1985 and 2011 are just plain different movies reflecting different sensibilities and cannot be judged in reference to each other.Since I hate 2011's tradition, Idiot Teenagers, I can't honestly rate it. My choice, Fright Night 1985. That's where the generation gap comes in, I spent the 70's and 80's developing a fondness for these little, well-crafted movies whether studio or independently produced and there were a lot of them. Then sensibilities changed and another generation gap appeared.",Fright Night
98,drew_atreides,Once the action kicks in it's actually pretty good!,8,28 August 2011,"I'm a big fan of the original Fright Night. Growing up in the 80's it was one of my favourite horror flicks. Roddy McDowall and Chris Sarandon give 2 of the classic horror movie performances.However, there are elements of it that have not aged well. They are decidedly 80's, and so when i heard it was up for a remake i have to admit i was kind of excited. This was one of those instances where i felt bringing the story into a modern setting could actually work.Movie starts off slow, and decidedly dark (in that sense of ""i can't see what the heck is going on up there on screen!"" dark!) There is something incredibly mute and somber about the whole affair.However, once the action kicks in (with a considerable bang!) it really does capture the flavour and fun of the original FRIGHT NIGHT. David Tennant has got some real shoes to fill in Peter Vincent, and i think he's charismatic enough to pull it off. His well-timed delivery elicited quite a few surprising laughs.Farrell's alpha-male intimidations of Charlie and Peter get more and more sinister as the film progresses. A very entertaining performance.Normally i hate the 3D cash grabs, and i payed to see this one in 2D, but to be quite honest there were quite a few shots that had me thinking ""That looks like it could've been cool in 3D"".. I think this is one instance where the 3D might not be a total rip-off.Overall a solid effort, and one i will be happy to add to my shelf next to FRIGHT NIGHT and FRIGHT NIGHT 2.",Fright Night
99,malmborgimplano-92-599820,Intriguing use of a post-Doctor Who David Tennant...,4,29 January 2015,"Directly after checking out of the role of the Doctor, Matt Smith went into a stage musical version of ""American Psycho."" I'm guessing that David Tennant took this role as a similar sort of post-Doctoral career palate cleanser, or rather palate-dirtier, to remind people he could play adult roles too. (Daniel Radcliffe took a similar tack post-Harry Potter with ""Equus."") Anyway, a boy has to do something in between acclaimed Shakespeare productions and hit BBC TV shows, and if you're a fan of Tennant through his work in truly wonderful shows, it's probably worthwhile to at least do what I did and fast-forward to his bits in this film to do a little David watching.I couldn't be called a huge fan of the first ""Fright Night"" in that I can't remember much about it except thinking it was pretty good, so I can't say this pales in comparison. The reason I watched most of this on fast-forward was just impatience. ""Did they forget they were making a horror film?"" was my thought twenty minutes in when a lengthy segment of teen sex comedy business seemed to have brought all previous attempts at creating suspense to a complete halt. The film did pick up when the protagonist entered Peter Vincent's theater/apartment, but I soon started fast-forwarding when Peter scooted into his panic room and the teens took over the story again.I won't say that it would have been a better film if there had been more Peter Vincent in it, but I do think Tennant's genuinely genre-friendly work here highlights how scattershot and unfocused the rest of the show is. He's sexy, funny and slightly scary all at the same time (a trick he repeated a couple years later in his Richard II) and the film seems to have spent its limited inspiration quotient on the scenes of Peter prowling his goth lair. The real vampire (who played him again?) in comparison was about as thrilling as a bag of Cheetos.I question the decision to carry over the name Peter Vincent from the original film. Roddy McDowall's character name was clearly an homage to mid-20th century Gothic horror stars Peter Cushing and Vincent Price, while I gather from other reviewers this Peter is supposed to be a sendup of Criss Angel, so why not call him something like Dann Lucifer (though I would have preferred Raymond Penn.)",Fright Night

Usually you don't watch a remake until you see the original but with Fright Night it was different for me. This remake of Fright Night is one of the few films that I liked that is aimed towards my (teenage) age group.With the same idea as the original, a teenager finds that his neighbor is a vampire. With many ideas involving teen themes, this turns into survival story in the Las Vegas area.Unlike most remakes which usually have bad casts, this film is just the opposite. Known actor Anton Yelchin is the lead with rising stars Christopher Mintz-Plasse and David Franco in supporting roles. Established star Colin Farrell plays the villain who is a vampire let loose into a cast full of teens. The vampires in this movie are of an old style and not like the modern vampires of recent movies and I appreciated and liked this.The Las Vegas setting provides cool hip scenes as well as some desert scenes which is kind of different for the horror genre. The movie also has an ending that puts everything into perspective and closes the film very nicely. All of this makes this film really stand out.Fright Night is solid and a hit. I think it is one of the top remakes ever.",Fright Night
104,blackmambamark,Damn good vampire fun.....,7,21 August 2011,"Can a horror remake actually be a good for a change? I mean, how many classic horror flicks does Hollywood have to crap on until they finally give up? ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre"", ""Amityville Horror"", ""Nightmare on Elm St."", ""Friday the 13th"", ""House of Wax"".......all of these films are examples of why i sometimes HATE Hollywood.Finally......a horror remake that's WORTH seeing. I must admit, i had some pretty low expectations walking into this, and it did way more than prove me wrong. Initially i thought they were going to make this a straight 'B' movie by incorporating tons of humor with their gore, which would have been fine with me, seeing that i love the genre'. But this movie was more fun than funny. Don't get me wrong, there are some sequences that are funny, but it had more of that 'drive-in' appeal to it's horror. And i loved every bit of it.It's story is pretty basic, and somewhat cliché'. I mean come on, a vampire living next door. But the weird thing is, it didn't come off as cliché'. And i think the biggest contribution to that was the pace of the film. Once you get past the first 10 to 15 minutes of the film, which are kind of dull, the movie quickly begins to morph into a fast paced gore fest. And now looking back on it......if it were not rated R, then this movie would have been stupid, and it would've fit in with every other crummy horror remake.But the aspect that i appreciated the most was the writing. For once, they didn't alter any rules to make their film different. They stuck with what already works, and left it up to the actors to make these vampire rules entertaining. And Collin Farrell did just that.Bottom Line.....Of all the horror movies that come out this year, this will probably be the one you will have the most fun at. It's funny, it's somewhat scary, but most of all, it's pretty damn entertaining. It's one of those movies i would've loved to of seen at the drive-in. If your tired of all this 'Twilight' crap, which they happen to mention in the movie itself, then this is really a breathe of fresh air to all the TRUE vampire fans.",Fright Night
105,Krackoon,Another Hollywood Rip Off.,5,25 July 2015,"Did 'Fright Night' really need to be remade? Absolutely not. The original still holds up very well. However, this average remake does try to hold it's own by not completely ripping off the original, so I'll give credit where it's due. Chris Sarandon's 'Jerry Dandrige' came across as a reasonable guy doing what he had to do to survive - but if you stand in his way, well, you know what happens. Colin Farell's version is more like a serial killer killing anyone and everyone in his territory. This is a nice change, since Colin doesn't have what it takes to portray Sarandon's version. Colin is the bigger name, and probably the all around better actor, but some parts are simply made for certain actors - and there's only one 'Jerry Dandrige.' As for the rest of the cast - again, probably the all around better cast of actors, but they just don't have the chemistry the original cast had. David Tennant receives a lot of the credit from fans, but it's really Colin Farrell who keeps 'Fright Night' afloat. Random Rambling's of a Madman: While Colin Farrell will never be 'Jerry Dandrige,' he did come across as a guy having a good time, and never taking himself or the role too seriously. If he had taken the serious route, things could have gotten ugly. Why the guy hasn't taken the next step, is beyond me. He's a capable actor - looks the part, but I'm sure there's something personal holding the guy back.",Fright Night
106,jcallows,surprisingly good!,8,17 February 2012,"I didn't expect much going into this film but it turned out to be very good. It managed to recapture the scariness and humor of the original but with a snappier, updated look. The cast and script were great and the pacing was just right.Although the setting was expanded and the script was updated for this film, it kept the same basic story and main characters as the original. And, just as important, it kept the proper blend of humor and horror that the original had. I enjoyed the original and I enjoyed this remake just as much. It has give me the belief again that good remakes are still possible.This is obviously a well crafted film so it puzzles me why it has such a low rating. It barely beat out that Karate Kid remake. This is appalling. This is a much better film than that.",Fright Night
107,tripperM,One of the few horror remakes that is actually on par with its original...,10,3 September 2016,"If you liked 1985s Fright Night, you're in for a treat. This remake takes notes from the original, loosens the tongue from cheek a bit, and gets the ball rolling quick. Good nods (apples), great acting (Farrell surprised me), and cool FX without overdoing the gore factor. Peter Vincent is still a coward pulled into a realm he doesn't want to believe in, Mom is still clueless, The loner friend is still a prat, and the damsel is still pretty; but all else is new and exciting. For laughs and suspense, this holds up. Somehow there needs to be 10 lines of text, so... I liked seeing Yelchin is something other than Star Trek. I'll be sure to watch Huff now as well. Toni Collette was just about unrecognizable since I saw her in Sixth Sense and Muriel's Wedding, but her acting is still great. Enjoy!",Fright Night
108,nexus-37,Good for a remake and nice nostalgy,8,25 January 2013,"I don't actually remember the original one so clearly, it's been a long time..But anyway, this somehow recalled me nostalgy way, some scenes look pretty familiar, very many laughs and everything in order.This movie was originally like one of a kind, so is this remake. Nice to see this kind of surprises. Still i don't like remakes much but this was truly and exception.One thing I really don't understand is why this is horror/comedy.. The comedy part I truly understand but there really wasn't any horror ANYWHERE. Maybe it is simply so that if there are vampires it must be horror.Worth to watch if you like classic horror-humor, not being too intellectual but having great laughs, at least I did :) 8/10",Fright Night
109,eytand94,Welcome To Fright Night....For Real!!!,8,21 August 2011,"Tom Holland's 1985 vampire romp ""Fright Night"" was a fun, campy little horror flick that had some good laughs, good scares, and some pretty awesome effects. Soon enough, the movie developed its cult fan base. In the end, I find the original ""Fright Night"" to be one of the most underrated horror films of the 80's.Frankly, I was actually quite excited for this remake, knowing that it had a great cast and Marti Noxon(who commonly wrote for ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"") was at the helm of the script. I personally don't mind remakes. Some people take them way too seriously. Of course, there are some that fail, but a lot of them work really well. The 2011 edition of ""Fright Night"" works! Set in a beautiful suburban area of Las Vegas, the movie introduces us to Charley Brewster, a nerdy but charismatic teenager who we find out has given up his relationship with his friend ""Evil"" Ed to be with the cooler kids, including his hot new girlfriend Amy. Then he meets Jerry Dandrige, a buff, sweet new neighbor that Charley's mom and Amy take a liking to. When Ed tries to warn Charley of Jerry's hidden, and gruesome, intentions, things take a turn for the worse. More people wind up missing, and it becomes evident to Charley that Jerry is a vampire. Nobody believes him before it's too late, and it's up to him and Hard Rock celebrity Peter Vincent to kill this sucker(pun intended) once and for all.While it pays so much respect to the original movie, ""Fright Night"" also adds a few new elements that elevate it above other remakes. There are some scenes that are lifted right from the original, even two of the original's most classic lines, but the movie breaks several horror movie rules and invents new ones, like whether or not a vampire can come into another person's house.The CGI effects in this remake are surprisingly quite good. I didn't see the film in 3D(which I heard doesn't do much for the movie), but in its 2D format, the geysers of blood shoot out magnificently without going over the top, and the makeup is true to the original vampire look in the 1985 film.""Fright Night"" boasts a fantastic cast of well-known actors. Anton Yelchin, as always, does a great job and fits the role of Charley perfectly. Toni Collette stands out as Charley's mother, and Imogen Poots is terrific as Amy. Unlike other horror blonds, the script allows Amy to be smart, and at times brave enough to try to take down Jerry herself. Also, Ms. Poots is an awesome screamer. Christopher Mintz- Plasse is great for the role of ""Evil"" Ed, and he was born to play that role in this remake. He gets some pretty funny lines and an enjoyable amount of screen time. David Tennant, known for starring in the recent TV revival of ""Doctor Who,"" takes over from Roddy McDowall as Peter Vincent, and makes for a funny vision of the character.And then there's Colin Farrell as Jerry. Don't get me wrong. The cast is wonderful. But Farrell eats his role up and nearly steals the show. Sometimes, he doesn't have to do anything, and he still creeps you out. One particular scene in which he has a conversation with Charley sets the character up to be quite fearful. This is not a ""Twilight"" vampire that Farrell creates. This is a ""rip your throat out with no regrets"" monster that is impossible not to be freaked out by. Basically, Colin Farrell bathes in his role like the character bathes in human blood.Marti Noxon's script is clever, funny, and smart, and by the looks of other recent horror outings, it's a script that's better than it should be.I'll just say that ""Fright Night"" is not particularly scary. But it's all about the entertainment here. The movie doesn't need to be scary. It's a horror-comedy that allows some good shocks with some great laughs. The original was always on the border of becoming too funny, but it stayed on its feet and kept the horror going. The remake does just that. It's carefully made and done with love for its source material. But otherwise, you can tell that director Craig Gillespie(""Lars and the Real Girl""), his cast, and his screenwriter had a ball making this movie. The nostalgia factor is high here, bringing us a combination of both 80's and 90's horror. If you loved ""The Lost Boys"" and the original 1985 flick, you will surprisingly love 2011's ""Fright Night."" I welcome it with open arms, and I'm glad I got to see it. Welcome to Fright Night...FOR REAL! P.S. For those of you who saw the original, you get an unbelievable cameo.",Fright Night
110,james1844,A Remake That Fails To Deliver,3,19 August 2011,"I was anxious to see this remake and while it had a decent look over all, I came away with several complaints and many problems with the overall story board. There were moments when the action was exciting and even thrilling to watch. I just wish the producers had used the storyboard from the original Fight Night and redeveloped it with today's possibilities of tools. One major complaint that really bothered me and seems to be a pattern in today's films geared to the youth and young adults today is the heavy handed use of vulgar language. This film literally beat a dead horse with the constant puke of four letter words. This, in no way, made the film a classic as was the original. This patter of insulting foul words showed me that today they (Hollywood) take cheap shots with the script. A very sad state of script writing that tells me we're in trouble in Tinsel Town.Last note to share is that so few films are getting over the C rating or maybe it's just me wanting more quality from the movie industry.",Fright Night
111,Reel_starz,"In Fright Night, finally a vampire with real bite",8,30 August 2011,"Vampires have acquired a rather unenviable reputation in recent years as the laughing-stock of the monster world. Once viewed as mysterious, exotic and fearsome, they have now been reduced to lovelorn, brooding sex objects in the fantasies of tween girls, thanks to such pop culture entries as the Twilight franchise, The Vampire Diaries and True Blood. In short, they have become wimps. There's nothing wrong with allowing the creatures a little humanity or portraying vampires that feel and are motivated by more than an insatiable bloodlust, but when they start becoming vegan and not only walking in sunlight, thus violating one of the most basic fundamentals of vampire lore, but sparkling, one can be forgiven for bemoaning the current state of a genre that has existed and thrived for thousands of years.Before you accuse me of using this review as an excuse to rant and rave, it has a point. I never imagined that I'd ever voice this sentiment, but thank God for Hollywood remakes. By all rights, Fright Night should've been a disaster on the scale of The Wicker Man waiting to happen, and the decision to bring a new version of the 1985 cult classic to the big screen seems questionable at best. Did I mention that it's also in 3D? And yet, by some (un)holy miracle, it worked. Propelled by an inexplicably appealing cast, Fright Night manages to be both enjoyably campy and legitimately good, never taking itself too seriously while also deftly avoiding the trap of self-parody. After all, if the film-makers see no genuine merit in their own creation, why should anyone else? Perhaps it's not surprising that it took a reach into the past to remind us that vampires can – and, many would argue, should – be creepy, even terrifying. In Fright Night, our main vamp, Jerry, played in the original by Chris Sarandon and in the remake, by a perfectly cast Colin Farrell, skimps on the soul-searching melodrama and instead serves up a dish of primal, unapologetic nastiness; despite the vanilla name, he's pure evil. With his gently seductive voice and, let's face it, deliciously good looks, Farrell exudes a calm, quiet charisma, his mere presence rendering both the audience and the other characters helpless and mesmerized, but he never lets us forget the sinister instincts that motivate Jerry's every action. Jerry is cocky, assured of his own invincibility, and it's that confidence, the way his voice never rises above a steady purr (?), the sly, knowing smile that always seems to be on his face or flitting just below the surface, that makes him such a riveting, menacing villain.As Charlie Brewster, the insecure and semi-neurotic but undeniably likable teen hero of the story, Anton Yelchin makes a good foil to Colin Farrell's swaggering vampire, and David Tennant steals scenes as the heavily eye-lined, leather pants-wearing Vincent Price, often adding some much-appreciated, dry humor to the darker, more insane moments. Christopher Mintz-Plasse, Imogen Poots and Toni Collette round out the supporting cast, not to mention a cameo that will surely please fans of the original Fright Night. Collette is the only weak link, though that's, at least partly, due to a thankless, minimally developed role. What makes the cast effective as a whole is their collective decision to play everything straight, where others might've been tempted to go over-the-top or cornball thanks to the material, which is really the stuff of B-grade horror films.To be clear, I don't necessarily mean that as an insult. Fright Night is corny and knows it, as evidenced by the cheesy special effects, the blatantly made-for-3D camera shots and dialogue exchanges like, ""I thought you needed an invitation"" ""Don't need an invitation if there's no house"". In fact, at its core, Fright Night is basically an old-fashioned monster movie, and on that level, it's a pure, fun blast. Less successful is the film-maker's attempts to make the affair more meaningful by adding on vague metaphors about being different and suburban ennui. Still, the half-hearted allegory subtracts little from the film's overall entertainment value, and while it may not be an artistic masterpiece, it doesn't aspire to that level either. Thanks to a delightful cast and a general willingness to embrace its fun and freaky nature, Fright Night is way better than it has any right to be, a breath of fresh air after years of stories filled with nothing but bland, mopey vampires.I do have one small confession to make: as of the writing of this review, I have yet to see the original movie upon which this one is based. Fear not, though. If the quality of a remake is measured by its ability to kindle within a viewer the crazed desire to get hold of the source material ASAP, then consider this film a bloody, brilliant success.",Fright Night
112,brentn,Some remakes are better than the original.,8,18 February 2021,"I know that without the original we wouldn't have this but it is undeniably the superior film...by far. All the actors involved were far more talented than the original's cast. Colin Ferrell was a way better villain, realistically charming and yet so evil. Toni Collette was not the annoying mother from the original and had more of a role and she also has an undeniable charm. Imogen Poots was not only prettier as the love interest but a much sweeter girl with a more seductive quality. Not to mention Anton who not only was a way more balanced protagonist but still gave us that nervous and fearful quality. Plus he looked younger which made for a more well round casting choice. The best contribution, Christopher Mintz-Plasse. Not only was he perfect for the role of Ed, but I hated Ed (Stephen Geoffreys) from the original film. Geoffrey's acting was so stunted, forced and just plain bad that my love for THIS film went through the roof. Plasse at least got to take on a more critical role being that he wasn't the skeptic from the original but the main source of ""inspiration"" that provokes the protagonist, making for a very real approach to the story. Last but not least, David Tenant. Tenant brought such quality to the film that just oozes talent and originality. His sarcastic wit and drunken antics as a B-List celebrity magician were flawless. The suspense was throughout and unrelenting and there is the right amount of action to appease any horror fan. The only drawback was some of the CGI was a little lackluster and there was really no need for a 3D aspect to this film. Aside from those minor flaws this is an absolutely awesome Horror-Comedy. Highly recommend for a date night or any night.",Fright Night
113,SeamusMacDuff,Unnecessary,2,5 October 2021,"A wan and wavering remake of a fun cult classic. They kept all the characters and the basic plot (a teenager's new next door neighbor is a vampire) and left all the charm, humor and frights. The Vegas setting adds nothing (see The Night Stalker for Vegas vamps) and Farrell as Dandridge is more serial killer/psycho than vampire. The worst is that Peter Vincent is now some schlock - but very wealthy - Vegas magician. There was no chemistry between him and Charlie. Watch the original and enjoy.What really got me was, despite Dandridge having a house of horrors to hold his victims, destroying Charlie's house next door, then chasing them down on the road to nearly kill them and instead killing Chris Sarandon in a cameo - there is absolutely no police involvement. How do you explain driving off in a murder victim's wrecked car? After all this, Jerry still just keeps on living at home next to the burned out shell of Charlie's house. Huh??",Fright Night
114,alanrayford,Welcome to Fright Night...for real.,8,27 December 2011,"Fright Night (2011) is a rare horror remake that, much like the Hills Have Eyes (2006) and Piranha (2010), does way more than merely not suck. There are parts of this remake which truly surpass the original. However, these are complemented by parts that definitely do not.The original, for the most part, felt like a PG-13 flick. This is a more visceral and streamlined tale cutting right to the hard truth--a boy fights for his life against a bloodthirsty monster. As such, gruesome and dark things occur. The opening scene, a rather muted and harrowing affair, truly sets the stage for what follows. This dark parable is further lifted by some fresh characterizations which help it break free from many of the ruts which pervade this genre.Jerry Dandridge (Collin Farrell) isn't a tortured soul. He isn't a sympathetic being who only wishes to be left alone as he reluctantly does what he must to survive. No, unlike what is commonly seen in contemporary fiction, he is entirely bereft of humanity. He moves into a neighborhood, feeds on its population and then leaves to start anew somewhere else. There is no regret or sorrow over what he does. He is a gleeful monster, through and through. Farrell is effortlessly able to carry off this hodgepodge of insincere charm and supernatural menace.Charlie Brewster (Anton Yelchin) is basically a normal kid who starts off as the worst kind of real world douchebag—the kind who alienates his friends for popularity. Thankfully, this doesn't last long before Brewster finds himself faced with his neighbor. When he is, and Dandridge literally comes knocking, Yelchin sells Brewster through his reactions. His performance delivers a young man who doesn't endlessly quote pop culture references. He doesn't get snarky. He's not a stoner monkey or horndog. We instead get a teen who narrowly manages to hold onto his sanity in the face of overwhelming darkness. Towards the end, while watching the sun come up over the mountains, he doesn't even blink when the light hit's his eyes. That's because he's been hollowed out and is nearly catatonic. Given the situation, that's really the best anyone could ever hope for, and Yelchin nailed it.There's also Charlie's mom, Jane (Toni Collette) and his girlfriend, Amy (Imogen Poots). Jane isn't the typical horror movie mom who goes to work at the beginning and gets home just in time to wonder what's happened to her home. She's actually present in the narrative and in her son's life. She also happens to have a pretty good handle on the lay of the land. So when Charlie warns her about Dandridge, she actually humors him—even though she doesn't understand what's going on. So instead of opposing her child, as most horror movie parents unwittingly do, she had his back 100%. As for Amy, she wasn't some doe eyed submissive. She was quite confident and assertive in what she wanted from her boyfriend—and her demands were in no way unreasonable. Like Jane, she backed Charles all the way. And, had it not been for Amy, when things started to get grisly, Charlie probably would've lost the ability to function rationally.The overall flow and direction of the screenplay by Marti Nixon is a strength. The acting by Farrell, Yelchin, Collette and Poots brought the characters to life. Everything else, sadly, drags the production down.Evil Ed (Christopher Mintz-Plasse) was unnecessary. He served no real function other than to pay homage to the original and paint Charlie Brewster as a dick. He was annoying, and his devotion to pop culture felt forced. Matter of fact, Fright Night (2011) wouldn't have lost anything from his omission. Since Charlie lived next door to Jerry, it's hard to believe he wouldn't have known something was wrong almost immediately—if for no other reason than seeing Jerry chat up his neighbor and her disappearing right afterwards. Here, Ed was simply too typical of the genre and didn't bring enough to the table to warrant his inclusion—not through his characterization or portrayal.Peter Vincent (David Tennant) was another letdown, but not due to Tennant's entertaining performance. This was due the script. Vincent's supposed to be an integral part of Fright Night. However, the character is treated more like a tacked on sidekick to Brewster and not a partner/mentor. In a perfect world, there would've been a few more minutes to accommodate a more detailed exploration of how Vincent's story mirrors Charlie's and how they're linked by this. Alas, this, a perfect world, is not.The biggest issue I take with Fright Night is the horrid CGI. Late in the movie, a character pulls back her face to reveal fangs. Besides that, she looked normal and was highly off-putting. Then she transforms into what can best be described as Mr. Potato Head on LSD. The same goes for Dandridge. An imposing and monstrously powerful predator, he's defanged upon vamping out and looks like a pale Sloth. When it comes to effectively rendering vampires, less has always been more since Lugosi's heyday.Fright Night (2011) boasts a script and direction which has a genuine edge and packs a bite. Dandridge, the Brewster's and Amy feel far more like genuine characters than cookie cutter caricatures. Ramin Djawadi's score, particularly the track ""How to Kill a Vampire"" is catchy and conveys the proper tone. This is counterbalanced by an unnecessary character, a lack of insight on Peter Vincent and some seriously hideous CGI. This had the potential to be better than the 1985 original. On the other hand, it could've been a lot worse. But, at the end of the day, it only breaks even. If you like the original, this is an alternate and well executed take that warrants watching. I'm rather saddened Fright Night didn't do well enough to warrant a sequel. I'd love to see what happens to Charlie now that the night has taken notice of him.",Fright Night
115,phoenixyk1,Fright Night? NICE SIGHT!,8,9 April 2012,"I have never been a fan of remakes, even worse when you find they are done by Dreamworks and Distributed by Disney - That horrific tale is even worse when the remake in question is a classic 80's Horror movie Franchise!!!Yet DREAMWORKS/Disney have worked wonders with this new take on an old favourite...It does not match the humour of the 80's original... But the acting is amazing! Colin Farrel comes across as just the perfect side of both charming and thrilling. Despite only a short appearance really given the length of the film,David Tennant as ""Peter Vincent"" is amazingly funny and perfectly believable as the films Anti-Hero (Well, You cannot call an alcoholic nut job a hero can you!)... He also has some of the films best lines... Really enjoyed it! and unlike the 80s classic - I did indeed jump out of my seat despite the fact that the scares were so obvious I should not have done!!! But who cares! Sometimes that little bit of familiarity is what saves a film...A definite one to watch... Glad I have it as i will watch this one again!",Fright Night

The movie gets down to it almost right away and it keeps the pace up throughout.Colin Farrell is top tier as the vampire king and the rest of the cast aced it. The perfect movie night fright flick!,Fright Night
117,TourettesPersonal,Return Of The Vampires,8,10 September 2011,"The original Fright Night was already a cult classic which makes this remake unnecessary. But since all vampires these days are less scary and like what Evil Ed said ""Love Sick"", it can be necessary for some reason. Bringing back the true vampire camp. Although it's not as scary as the original but Colin Farrel's performance improves the vampire villain. This Fright Night is endlessly watchable and fun. This may sound strange but I think this version is better than the original.The original have the disturbing schlocky masks but this version actually has the vampire danger and thrills. The credit goes to Colin Farrel. He gives a lot of vigor and terror to the evil vampire. David Tennant has his own Peter Vincent. His charisma and delight shines through all of his scenes. Just like Roddy McDowall, David Tennant nearly steals the show. But Farrel really owns this show.It's a welcome back, actually. It's not a cash in remake. It's the returning of the vampire horror to our cinemas. Our vampire movies these days are just tired and relies to nothing but the senseless violence. And some of them are in love with a bland girl and sparkle in sunlight. But the biggest thing that is missing in most modern vampire movies is how scary these monsters are. They are not only bloodsuckers. They can be terrifying for somehow.The filmmaking is obviously good but some of the CGI tones the scares down a little bit but it works though. The score sounds nothing like the score of the original but it's true to its vampire genre. The movie is shot in 3D but most of the film is dark and 3D usually dims the aspect of a film but if you are in for some blood and sparks coming out of the screen then try it. Not quite recommending though.Overall, Fright Night is enjoyable. Maybe the biggest mistake they made is the jump scares since Fright Night isn't really fond to that trend. Well, this is definitely better than all the unnecessary horror remakes we usually get every year. Colin Farrel made a lot of things better. Vampires are evil again. It has plenty of joys and thrills. Fright Night is recommendable by bringing back the true elements of the genre.",Fright Night
118,ARTaylor,Among the Great Remakes,9,28 August 2011,"Fright Night is based off the 1985 film of the same name. Personally, I didn't particularly care about the original. It was okay but I didn't think it was anything special. The mix of horror and comedy has given it a dedicated following over the years. I've never seen the sequel, but everything I've heard says it's pretty bad. Now, remakes and reboots are all the rage, especially if they are a movie from the 80s. Many of these remakes have been merely okay at best, and most are pointless. So how does this remake stand up? Incredibly well, in fact.In the great pantheon of film remakes, Fright Night stands alongside greats like The Thing, The Blob '88, Invasion of the Body Snatchers '78 for one simple reason: the story remains true to the original while making enough differences to be their own movie. The story is basically the same, so there's no real surprises for fans of the original. But it isn't just a shot-for-shot remake like Psycho or what seems like a rehash like The Karate Kid. It may have the same run time but the pacing is different, events are rearranged, and people do the same thing for different reasons.It's these subtle differences that really make the movie stand out. For one, the movie is been updated with contemporary themes. Instead of large Gothic mansions set in some anonymous suburb, this is set in regular homes near Las Vegas. There's a lot played with the last decade's housing boom and subsequent crash. Real life problems such as foreclosures and abandoned houses put a modern twist on classic vampire lore. This makes this version much more relatable to modern audiences. And, much like Invasion '78, a simple change of location provides much thematic differences from the original. The (in)famous Vegas nightlife and spectacle shows play a big role in the film and compliment vampire lore in a modern way perfectly.The cast is good all around. No one falls short. Anton Yelchin handles being the center of the movie well. But the two standouts are David Tennan as Peter Vincent and Colin Farrell as Jerry Dandrige. Tennan follows Roddy McDowall in an equally impressive role. He's clearly bringing some of Russell Brand into his version and makes a fun and interesting role that is his own. Though it's Ferrell who steals the movie as the villain. He's incredibly creepy but almost charming. There's an intelligence that comes through his performance in a Bela Lugosi's Dracula kind of way. This is an intelligent villain who isn't intimidated by the heroes.The tone of the film maintains what made the original so memorable. It's true to the spirit of the original by maintaining the clever mix of fun comedy and suspenseful scares. As stated, Jerry is like the shark from Jaws and when he's on the hunt you never really know how it's going to end. And when he finally does get going the action doesn't stop. Then the movie will pull out some joke that lightens the mood. Like at one point, Jerry attacks someone then immediately talks to onlookers like he's going out for beers with them later. It's little things like this that make the movie entertaining throughout.There's only one black spot on the movie, and that deals with ""Evil"" Ed. First, Christopher Mintz-Plasse plays the same exact character he's played in Superbad and Kick-Ass. That same goofy, bumbling character who's trying to be more than he really is. I'm beginning to wonder if he can play any other kind of character. Luckily, he only has a few scenes in the movie. Second, Ed is pretty much wasted in the movie. There's a backstory between Ed and Charley that ends up not having much to do with the story, and their relationship isn't finished well. Ed seemed more like an afterthought, as though they didn't know how to adapt the character properly and he seems forced into this story.On another note, I saw the movie in 3D and it's wasted. The opening titles look good and there's an interesting long shot set in the car, but that's about it. And unfortunately, there's a lot of gimmicky stuff that pop out at the screen. Things like hands, balls, spikes, etc popping out at the audience was silly back in the 50s and remains that way to this day. Stuff like that draws attention to itself and takes the audience out of the movie-watching experience.Fright Night is one of those remakes that easily equals, and quite possibly surpasses, the original. It wisely uses the original as merely a frame to craft its own story. Fans of the original should appreciate the modern twist, and it should be entertaining enough to draw in new fans. This is the kind of remake that movie fans wait for. Let's just hope that the sequel, if and when, is better than the original sequel.",Fright Night
119,pseawrig,Sorta joyless,5,8 August 2020,"Thought this remake was visually striking and action packed, but also sorta flat and lacking a sense of fun. Instead of charismatic horror host Peter Vincent, we get miserable magician Peter Vincent. Instead of enthralling and dangerous Jerry Dandridge, we get muscle bound, murderous Jerry. Instead of the excitingly strange Evil Ed, we get Ed the jilted sad sack. Even Amy seems drained of personality- in the original she was quirky and conflicted; here she's a stock character, ""the cool girlfriend."" Anton Yelchin and Toni Collette both turn in excellent performances, but imo their vibrancy doesn't compensate for an arguably lackluster script.",Fright Night
120,knowyourmovie,"The 2011 remake of ""Fright Night"" is not a bad movie, but it is weaker than the original",6,30 December 2011,"On the outside, making a movie looks a lot like cooking in the sense that it transforms the ""raw ingredients"": script, actors, music, cinematography, art, decorations, and costumes into a complete, ready for consumption product.Just as with cooking, it all starts with the ingredients. How often have we seen a movie with the bleeding with high fructose corn syrup script, expired actors, rotten directing, tasteless music, or saturated with fat cinematography?Moreover, just as with cooking, decent ingredients alone are not sufficient for making a quality movie: what you do with these ingredients matters a lot and the 2011 remake of ""Fright Night"" is a good proof of that.Despite having the overall solid components: cohesive plot, convincing acting, suspenseful music, nice visual effects, ""Fright Night"" was unsuccessful in blending all its fine quality ingredients into an original, exciting, savory product. As a result, the movie turned out somewhat bland, lifeless, and easily forgettable.In particular, the 2011 remake failed to properly mix and stir comedy and horror into a delicate combination that would be both scary and funny at the same time - something that the original ""Fright Night"" made in 1985 had generally excelled in.It does not help that laughter and fear are known to be the opposites. Humor drives off fear, and fear paralyzes and blocks humor. That is why it is usually a big challenge to combine a comedy and a horror in such a way, that they would highlight and enhance each other (as it worked in the original ""Fright Night""), rather than dilute and cancel each other (as it happened in the 2011 remake). Another weakness of the remake lies in how it treats the sexual undertones inevitable in most of the vampire movies. While the original 1985 movie generally focuses on a comical side of things and makes (mostly innocent) fun of a teenage hyper-sexuality, the remake is much more into a hardcore, uncontrolled lust that becomes a main, all- absorbing motivation for the adolescent movie characters. Overall, ""Fright Night"" is not a bad movie, but a typical example of a remake that lacks vision and is weaker than the original in almost every area. While the remake has some funny scenes, some decent scares, and some suspense, the original movie is funnier, scarier, and more suspenseful. While the remake has some decent acting, still Chris Sarandon is a more comically ironical and charismatic ""vampire Jerry Dandrige"" than Colin Farrell, Roddy McDowall is a more colorful and versatile ""Peter Vincent"" than David Tennant, and Stephen Geoffreys is a quirkier and funnier ""Evil Ed"" than Christopher Mintz-Plasse. One would think that at least the modern, computer generated special effects of the remake should surpass the 25 year old ""ancient"" effects of the original. However, as it turns out, while slightly outdated and slightly less realistic, the special effects in the 1985 ""Fright Night"" are still more creative, more diverse and more effective than the freshly baked, but somewhat scarce and fast food-ish effects of the 2011 remake.knowyourmovie.blogspot.com",Fright Night
121,cultjones,Right Night for Fright Night,7,11 February 2013,"I knew very little about the original or the remake and expected a clichéd flick where a kid spends the entire movie trying to convince his family that the neighbor is a vampire. Surprisingly, it was anything but predictable! It was as if Director, Craig Gillespie and writers, Marti Noxon and Tom Holland, threw convention out the window and made a movie to truly entertain! With a string of lack luster movies, this seemed perfect film for Colin Farrell to illustrate his range, make his mark and climb back up to the 'A' list. Fortunately, he didn't disappoint and managed to compliment the quick and witty script exceptionally well. Anton Yelchin, Toni Collette and David Tennant round out the recognizable cast and each plays their role quite well.Fright Night is truly a pleasant surprise and Gillespie does a fantastic job of captivating and surprising the viewer. Even the end credits, which run against Hugo's rendition of '99 Problems,' are entertaining! How often can you say that?",Fright Night

I had glorious memories of being in my 20's and seeing this movie with my fiancé. Now my wife of 26 years, I was grasping for touches of the old thriller which made her cling to me until the end of the original Fright Night. Instead, I got a not fully developed hurry up version. It lacked any of the newness the original had. Ferrel seemed as if he was phoning in his performance and the development of the characters was abandoned as if the director left it up to the original version to be our platform. I'm not too sure why they decided the success of the 80's version could be out done by a synopsized poorly developed watered down version. I believe if they stuck with the ""Boy Who Cried Wolf"" theme, they would have had as much box office success as the original did.This a definitely a missed opportunity.

I saw it because a friend really wanted to go to the movies, and not much else was playing.This was just mildly amusing shallow entertainment. Not particularly frightening, nor original, but ""OK"".It is hard not the compare this ""Fright Night"" to the original, as the story is essentially identical. I do not have a deep enough understanding of the subtleties of film to understand why this is so, but the more recent ""Fright Night"" definitely lacked the charm of the original. One thing for sure, Chris Sarandon was certainly a far better vampire than Colin Farrell. I never really ""felt"" Farrell in that role...there was just something too pedestrian about him to be convincing.I will say this...if you have not seen the 1985 original, skip the 2011 version entirely and do so.

126,BornKnight,A Remake that isn't as good as the original,7,24 March 2012,"Fright Night is a remake and reinterpretation of the classic 1985 film, Fright Night, about a teenager, addicted to TV horror series (particularly a show called ""Fright Night"", which has a vampire hunter named Peter Vincent), who discovers that his new neighbor is a vampire, and after the neighbor noted that he knows these secret, he tries to prove this to everyone, together with his friend and girlfriend. The big difference between this version and the previous one, is that this is move fells more for a horror one, and can not recreate the atmosphere of the first film. The roles are reinvented and adapted to modern times, and to a different city (Las Vegas): Jerry Dandrige works well, but I think as Jerry Dandrige (the vampire) is not at the same level as Chris Sarandon in the classic movie, that was a better villain. The actors now, are usually better (the vampire slayer Peter Vincent, played by David Tennant is very good and funny in the role), but the film has another air, pulled into the action and horror genre (but ends up being a bit tedious) and have a end that gives the impression that the movie ended too soon. Still, it's a good entrainment as a movie, although lower than the original - My Score: 6.7 / 10.0",Fright Night
127,MarkSaltzer,"Excellent Remake, Top Shelf",8,28 November 2011,"This movie stands on its own two feet as a suspenseful, action packed, comical and blood soaked Vampire movie of the highest regard. Being a huge fan of the original, at the tender age of 15 at the time, I was worried that they may destroy the legacy that Fright Night '85 gave us... although when you really think about it, Fright Night 2 did that already.Fright Night '11 has excellent moments, sublime casting and truly magical performances from all of its talented cast members. The casting team should give themselves a great big pat on the back for their work, because this movie could have easily gone pear shaped if they had have been effected with the CBF virus, as seen in other casting companies of late.One of the things I love about Fright Night '11 is the fact that it loosely bases itself on the premise of the '85 version, ie. Living Next Door To A Vampire, but makes the story, scenes and character depictions it's very own. I love the new version of Peter Vincent, he made me want a Midori and Lemonade so bad while I was watching his scenes. Colin Friel also gave a tremendous performance and was an awesome and flawless vampire, I really tried to score him down (Don't know why, maybe I just loved Sarandon's performance), but every second of every scene that he was in, he shone like the true star that he is.One thing that I did miss from this modern version, something that shone like a diamond in the sunlight in the original, was the soundtrack. The Tom Holland version had an awesome soundtrack including Brad Fiedel's haunting ""Come To Me"" which kind of became Jerry Dandridge's anthem. I even bought the original motion picture soundtrack on cassette back in 1986 and loved it, can't say I will buying the soundtrack for this version on iTunes anytime soon, but I guess the kids today aren't all that interested in quality music anymore, thanks Ke$ha and GaGa.Wrapping up, I would thoroughly recommend Fright Night '11 to any lover of good horror, action, adventure, sitcom movies, it's ""Double Snaps"" from me.",Fright Night
128,arginnon,An average burger,6,12 May 2012,"The movie is nothing special it all. I had a hard time figuring out whether it was a comedy or a horror film, because if it was the first, it wasn't funny enough. It had some laughs, but that's about it. If it was the latter, it didn't take itself seriously enough. It wasn't scary at all. If they were trying to do a mix of both genre's, they failed at that too. Sure they've taken the basic elements of comedies and horror movies, but the mix wasn't right. The two genres simply went against each other, and in the collision both suffered greatly. But Fright Night still didn't fail to entertain.There were some pretty good stuff in the movie too. The first thing is David Tennant. I hated him in Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire (he played Barty Crouch Jr.), but in this film he was entertaining as hell! Colin Farrell did a good job too, the others were either too flat or (in the case of Christopher Mintz-Plasse) they went over the top.What also worked was the music. Ramin Djawadi is the man! His awesome soundtracks never fail to impress me, I can't wait for his next movie. Sadly that's pretty much the end of the positive aspects of the film. It was kinda stupid, the story was dumb, the directing average. Although they tried to put some deeper meaning into the movie, it didn't work.If I was to compare Fright Night to a food, it would be an average burger. Fun enough, but won't silence your growling stomach for long.Score: ★★★",Fright Night
129,gnix1979,As good as the original in its own way,9,21 November 2014,"If you have not seen this movie yet, please do so as soon as possible, I believe Netflix has it and maybe Amazon's on demand service has it too but don't know, but you have to see this film.Considering the original Fright Night is a masterpiece of creative thinking, I tried to look at this movie as I did with the Italian Job, and look at the movie as more of a reinvention or even a montage to the original because if one looks at a movie as a remake, then you will automatically set a bar that is way to high. That's why I liked the newer Italian Job.As for Fright Night, in comparison to the original it is definitely modern, the soundtrack, the sets and atmosphere are refreshed and the initial back story to Peter Vincent was interesting considering the location of the movie and was a good substitute for how he is introduced in the original.However watching this movie it did lack on a few things which prevents be giving this 10/10, and in short it was the things I liked in the original that I thought were missing. First of all the character of Ed (Evil Ed), in the original he was a sidekick for Charlie, and he was used just enough to make him a likable character and saddened by his demise at the end, in the newer version, the character is under used and his I was less impressed when we see him as vampire. The second thing that I thought was lacking was the relationship that Charlie has with Jerry. In the original the main focus of the film is that Charlie knows Jerry is a vampire because he catches Jerry with a woman, that moment was amazing, but because of technology, Jerry is found out through candid camera (in other words cast no reflection). Thus leads to the inevitable battle of wits between Charlie and Jerry. In the original this battle was longer and it involved more people and was far more believable, this was sadly lacking in the newer version.Neither of these negative points make the movie bad, but just things I hoped to have seen but never did. If I was to point out another negative it would be the soundtrack, most fans will agree that the soundtrack to the original helped make the movie, in particular the song that I call Jerry's theme (original title: Come To Me) is used to great effect, as well as the music used in the nightclub scenes.But I give this 9/10 because this movie holds its own in its own way. Colin Farrell's Jerry in my opinion is far more sadistic then then Chris Sarandon's Jerry, and he is able to use his likable charm to great effect in this role, that being said Sarandon's Jerry was more the likable in some ways, he is suave and also has charm, and his mannerisms are excellent. The character of Charlie is interesting when you compare Anton Yelchin and William Ragsdale. Both play the role well, were as Ragsdale's version is more the teenager who knows it all but nobody believes, Yelchin's version shows a more human element to the character especially when you see him after the hospital scene.Any way, see it and make up your own mind, but its all good.",Fright Night
130,ablebravo,Wasn't that bad,5,11 May 2013,"I'll be honest: usually I have an automatic hate for remakes - especially films which were good to begin with. Why bother, you know? That is just a big ego trip on the part of the filmmaker who thinks he can do better. Is this one better than the original? No. Is it worse? No, not really. The best way I can describe this if I had to choose only one word would be ""unnecessary"". Sure there was some stronger scenes than the original, but somehow the comedic spark which made the original so appealing was lacking here. They tried, but not hard enough. This wasn't as bad as some of the haters are making this one out to be, but it really didn't do anything better or worse than the original one. All things considered, I enjoyed it for what it was. I was able to blank out the original in my memory and just watch this one and let it happen. Would I watch it again? Oh, maybe. Not tomorrow, but yeah. I guess I'd watch it again.",Fright Night
131,dustinkdye,A silly and entertaining vampire movie,6,24 March 2013,"""Fright Night"" is the latest in a long line of vampire movies to come out in the wake of the Twilight craze. It is similar to the 1985 cult film of the same name (which I haven't seen). The film gently pokes fun at ""Twilight"" while cashing in on the vampire mania the series renewed.""Fright Night"" is set in a Las Vegas suburb where residents water their lawns, wash their cars, and let their kids play in the sprinklers, despite living in the middle of a desert. This is an interesting setting, which serves as more than a backdrop. The suburb is the perfect habitat for a vampire since one can live in a house with blacked-out windows without arising suspicion. (We're informed many people in this commuter town have blacked-out windows because they work on the Strip at night and sleep all day.)The film stars Anton Yelchin (""Terminator Salvation"") as Charley Brewster, a nerdy guy whose girlfriend, Amy (Imogen Poots), is admittedly out of his league. His perfect life takes a turn for the worse when Jerry the vampire (Colin Farrell) moves in next door, and Charley's classmates and neighbors go missing one by one.Except for the suspicious Dumpster in his front yard, Jerry the vampire is a seemingly normal guy--he kicks back with a beer to watch TV and he has dead strippers in his closet. In addition to feeding on the living, he also eats apples, since that is apparently what vampires like to eat judging by the cover of ""Twilight."" Charley doesn't begin to suspect Jerry until his classmate and childhood friend who isn't cool enough for him anymore, Ed (Christopher Mintz-Plasse, McLovin from Superbad, playing pretty much the same role here), spots the warning signs of vampire activity.Charley goes to Las Vegas to enlist the help of drunken vampire expert- extraordinaire Peter Vincent, whose name I assume to be a combination of Peter Cushing and Vincent Price. Peter reluctantly helps Charley stop Jerry the vampire.""Fright Night"" was an entertaining movie with a few laughs and a few thrills. (I wonder if Century 21 paid for the product placement.) However, it never quite found the right tone. It's not creepy enough to be a horror film, and it is not funny enough to be a satire. There are good special effects throughout. I especially liked the way the vampires exploded when they stepped out into the sunlight. (I was worried they would sparkle.) But the film was too dim in some scenes, making it hard to figure out what was happening on the screen. I don't think this was a problem with the projector or lenses, since I saw ""Rise of the Planet of the Apes"" on the same screen just prior to this, and that film looked fine. I watched ""Fright Night"" in 2D, so I imagine these scenes would just be a confusing black blur in 3D.Despite not finding the right tone, ""Fright Night"" was enjoyable and should appeal to its target audience.",Fright Night
132,slasherstudios,"New ""Fright Night"" Lacks Bite",4,29 August 2011,"Going into the remake of ""Fright Night"", I was a bit apprehensive. The original is my favorite vampire film of all time and I just felt that deep down they were going to find some way to mess up the remake. Then the trailers came in (everything looked solid, if a bit underwhelming), then the reviews came in (75% is just about perfect for a horror film), and then the reaction from fans came in—They didn't mess it up! I couldn't wait to watch the remake. I sat down in my seat eager for the movie to start as I put on my 3D glasses and was ready for the wild vampire ride to begin.The film starts quite promising. We are given a skyline shot of houses in the suburb. The kind of suburb where everyone owns the same car, the same house, and the same two kids. And then BAM, three killings before the opening credits can even hit the screen. I was ready! This is going to be the remake to end all remakes! Sadly, it was not to be. The plot is generally the same as the original with a few small changes. Teenager Charley Brewster guesses that his new neighbor Jerry Dandrige is a vampire responsible for a string of recent deaths. When no one he knows believes him, he enlists Peter Vincent, a self proclaimed vampire killer and Las Vegas magician, to help him take down Jerry.What doesn't work about this movie? Well, aside from a few stylish touchespretty much everything. Gone is the old, charming horror host Peter Vincent and in is a Midori chugging whorish magician. Ugh. Gone is the beautiful shot and exciting club scene in which Jerry seduces Charley's girlfriend Amy (it's here, but the less said about the ""new"" version of this scene the better). Gone is Jerry's homo-erotic relationship with his best ""friend""/roommate. Hell, that character isn't even IN this film. What's added? Awful CGI (Amy's vampire scene with Charley is incredibly lame and doesn't look half as good as it did in the TWENTY FIVE year old original) and a final battle scene that belongs more to ""Underworld"" than it does to the ""Fright Night"" legacy. That being said, It's worth a rental at least. The movie wasn't so much bad as it was incredibly disappointing. I felt there was so much more they could have done with the premise. What a waste.",Fright Night
133,Nefi,excellent remake; so sad that it went down in such a spectacular fashion,8,28 September 2011,"I finally got to see the remake of Fright Night. As a fan of the original who has seen it countless times since the 80s, I can wholeheartedly state that this new version is one of the best remakes I have ever seen.The original story was brought wonderfully up to date. It was so clear that everything was deeply thought out. The original had a slight balance toward comedy. Here that balance is shifted a bit more towards the horror side so the film has a perfect mix of both elements in my opinion. It made me seriously tense and left me creeped out and this coming from someone who knows the flow of the main story by heart! Colin Farrell was in one word spectacular. Here is a vampire that really scares you underneath those extreme good looks, capable of turning out to be a ruthless monster in the blink of an eye. The violence by the way was pretty strong. I was positively surprised by the amount of gore for such a big budget studio production. And the 3D. I loved the 3D of the film. So subtle but at the same time as in your face as it gets when the scene necessitates it.Which brings me to the unbelievable box office failure of this wonderful film Stateside. How did this happen? I will tell you. An unfortunate release at the tail end of the summer when in fact the film practically screams for a fall Halloween release date, coupled with two other 3D pictures (Conan the Barbarian and Spy Kids 4) at the same week not to mention another regular 2D release (One Day). They all died a quick death, with American audiences rejecting all four of them and flocking to a Southern anti-racist drama and an ape movie in huge numbers. I did not see the other 3 films as of today but I have to say that the flopping of Fright Night 2011 is one of the most unjust failures in the whole history of movies. The current 3D fatigue of Anmerican public was the main benefactor in this case. How else can you explain that all three of these 3D releases flopped in such a spectacular fashion during the same week? They clearly did not bother to make any distinction among the good and bad films that week and went with a to- hell-with-them-all attitude. Sorry but this I can not understand. Another thing I cannot understand is why this film was also practically ripped to pieces by professional critics and internet commentators unanimously. What's wrong with you guys? Is none of you able to spot a decently made gem of a film among all the family entertainment trash anymore? This film certainly did not deserve the fate it endured. I am soo sad about it all..And one side note: Cinemablend.com meticulously analyzes and rates each 3D release regularly which greatly helps me when picking up what to watch in 3D. But in the case of Fright Night 2011, even that trusted site seems to have erred. At the time of the film's release in the US, the relevant article headed ""Fright Night: To 3D or Not to 3D"" specifically stated that the film was a terrible choice to be filmed in 3D since the many night scenes did not fare well in 3D mode because of the dimming of the projection light by the 3D glasses and that as a result it was impossible to see what was going on during most of the film's night scenes. Wroooooong! In the showing I attended at my local cinema, the film was very clear and there was absolutely nothing wrong with the dimness settings of the picture. The action was very clear to follow and at no point did I experience any difficulties regarding the 3D aspect of the film. So I am itching to ask: Could there possibly be something wrong with the projection settings of the films shown in the US theaters in general? American moviegoers seem to be really upset about these 3D projection issues for quite some time now and the whole thing now started to result in such box office anomalies as what was experienced by this unfortunate movie. Someone better do something Stateside about this whole issue or the future of 3D really is in trouble as regards the American market in my opinion since the notion of ""3D"" itself seems to have turned into box office poison as of late. Ooops!",Fright Night
134,elvisrivet-1,A solid remake that's as good as the 1985 film,7,21 August 2011,"I wasn't looking forward to the remake for Fright Night when I first saw the trailer, because to be honest it didn't look like it was going to be that great of a movie. I decided to give it a watch though because I'm a huge fan of the 1985 movie of the same name. The plot for the remake is quite sample, Jerry the vampire moves in next door to Charley Brewster, at first Charlie dosen't believe this, he think's his friend is making the whole thing up. But when Ed goes missing, Charley has no other choice but to believe that Jerry is indeed a vampire, and this is where the fun begins. The film's opening was pretty intense, and it was a great opening to the movie, yeah it was a little expected so it wasn't really that much of a surprise when I saw the movie, I kinda guess at what was going to happen, but still it was a solid opening. From there the movie slows down a little bit to develop the story, although to be honest it dosen't take very long to get the story going. This is the weak point of the movie, I didn't like the first thirty minutes that much because it just felt a little to slow and some things just didn't make that sense to begin with, but these are only minor problems that are soon taken care of. Withen the first thirty minutes into the movie, we already see what Jerry can do and what his motives are, he want's Charley dead, and he dosen't care how he's going to do it. What make's Fright Night so fun is that it dosen't take it's self to serious, yes it does have it's moments but its more funny then anything else, yes it's a little cheesy and campy, but that's what it makes it fun.I loved the cheesiness of the movie I embraced it, it's like the 1985 film it was cheesy but it was still a fun little film, that you could watch with your friends and just enjoy it for what it is. Now this isn't to say the remake isn't without its probelms because it does have some, like I mentioned before I wish they would've developed the story a little more and not just brush things aside, it would've been nice if they would've explained why Jerry was going after Charley in the first place, yes I know he's going after Charley because he know's he's a vampire but still the movie dosen't quite explain this enough and it kinda bugged me, but this is only a small problem that I quickly got over. The main problem of the film is its CGI, yes the CGI did look pretty good at times but most of the time it just felt tacky and looked terrible to be honest, I don't know if that was done on purpose because of the cheesiness of the film, but still they're could've fixed some of it up a bit to make it look a little better. I feel that the CGI was rushed most of the time and could've been a lot better then what it was, it was a little distracting at times, and for me this is the worst thing about the movie, but it still didn't stop me from enjoying it as much as I did.Now all of the actors did a pretty decent job in the film, but I have to say Colin Farrell stole the show, he was perfect as Jerry. He did a terrfic job a lot better then what I was expecting him to do, I'd say he was as good as Chris Sarandon in the 1985 film. David Tennant also did a wonderful job, I have to say he was the second best of the bunch next to Colin Farrell, Tennant was just so funny in the film no matter what scene he was in, it was hard to take him serious at times but that was the whole point I think. The rest of the cast all did a good job with what they had, they just didn't stick out to me like Tennant and Farrell did. Overall the movie is a solid a remake that's even as enjoyable as the 1985 film, I recommend you go see it as soon as possible.",Fright Night
135,Some-asshole,A horrible remake that has almost no redeeming qualities in my opinion,2,20 August 2019,"I don't understand how people see this as a great film. Have they seen the original? I'm not trying to disrespect other people's opinions but people are over praising this in my opinion. Here are my reasons why I hate this terrible remake:
1. The characters are horrible, especially when compared to their counterparts. The new Charlie is a mean and unlikable jerk, Amy is now just eye candy on Charlie's arm with no other personalities, and Ed is underdeveloped and is bitten early in the movie. Also, Dave Franco's character is a horrible abomination as a stereotypical bully and the new Peter Vincent is unlikable and miserable. It's not fun watching a film with every character being unlikable. And Jerry is weak compared to his original counterpart.
2. The story is just the original, without any fun. The remake tells the story the same way, only it gets rid of the mystery and suspense of Jerry, and the development of some characters, like Amy looking like Jerry's dead lover.
3. The effects are awful. The effects are like 98% CGI and it looks really really bad.
4. The setting is in Las Vegas instead of a suburban town in Iowa. This change was probably made since the filmmakers can't spot Iowa on a map.
5. The action isn't interesting. The action is almost always CGI, and the characters fighting aren't likable, losing the ability to cheer for them.
6. The opening scene is dumb. Instead of opening to the teenagers having fun, which already gets the audience's attention, the remake opens up to disposable characters being killed by Jerry.Awful remake",Fright Night

If you're a fan of the original (I know I am), please do yourself a favor and FORGET that this is a remake. I think that it was a huge distraction for me to be aware of the original one because it changes A LOT of key situations and the story arc, and I kept thinking ""this won't make sense with what comes next"", although it did make sense because at the end, THIS Fright Night is a totally different monster than the 80's one.Just go to the theaters thinking that this is loosely based on the original and enjoy the ride... it is actually quiet fun this time too.Cheers!",Fright Night
138,white_fire4,"Not your average remake, shining example of how to do it right",8,26 November 2011,"The original Fright Night is a classic monster movie, many many people grew up loving it and watching it again and again, it's a cult classic. And like so many classic horror movies, it was inevitable this would be remade as well.Unfortunately, this decision comes after the massive sweep of disappointing horror remakes, especially of the big 3 (Nightmare, Friday, and Halloween) and so it was met with a lot of negativity and skepticism, myself included.I was, thankfully, very wrong.The only reason I write this so long after the release, is I did not see it in theaters, as there were no shows in non-3D, a fact which also likely hurt the movie very much. 3D had no place in this film, what parts were even 3D in nature were obviously changed at the last minute to be part of that cheap gimmick.The movie starts off with showing us a random family being killed by Jerry, and then goes into a homage of the opening of the original, with Charlie watching a promo for Fright Night with Peter Vincent, except of course, it's on an HDTV this time around.The movie is filled with small homages like this, from Evil sarcastically saying ""Oh, you're so cool Brewster"" to Charlie calling him Evil, the club scene where Jerry takes and turns Amy, Amys face contorting into that overly sinister and freaky grin like in the original (unfortunately only for one brief shot) and many other things.The story is paced much faster this time around, there isn't nearly as much wondering and worrying, spying on the neighbor and everything. And Jerry does not bide his time and play along with Charlie, quite the opposite in fact, once Charlie is onto him and becomes a nuisance, Jerry actually goes after him full force, which was a quite pleasant change from the original.Much of the same stuff happens in this film, just in different ways and at different points, modernized, but yet still with that charm of the original. An actual remake, taking what the original did and had, and making it into its own movie, but not forgetting what it's supposed to be.This one also ups the gore level considerably, though it's nothing modern day movie goers aren't used to, and by todays standards, would probably be considered a bit tame for a horror movie. Ironically, it's actually Evil Ed that gets most of the gore parts in the film, he loses a limb, is hacked in the neck by an axe, and has part of his heart stabbed out of his chest as well.There are a few small things this film does not bring over, or changed for the worse however. None of the vampires change into any type of animal or anything, so there are no scary wolf creatures, no Ed in that horrific half man/half wolf state, no demonic bat, no melting zombie type thing. While the ending does take place in Jerrys home and mainly in the basement, Jerrys home is nowhere near as grand or interesting as in the original, it's just a normal, boring suburban house which hides a rather extended basement under it, which in itself is rather underwhelming.And then of course, at the end, after Jerry having been much more creative and forceful and gung ho about killing Charlie throughout the movie, he gains the stupid villain curse and basically toys around with him.As far as remakes go however, this is a shining example of how to do it right. It's not perfect, so many movies nowadays aren't, but it's certainly above the rest of the remakes that have come out in recent years, and should not be missed just because we've had to wade through so much trash before.You won't be disappointed.",Fright Night
139,LadyBeth10,"Great, great movie!!!!",10,17 September 2011,"Let's face it, if you're a horror aficionado, there's been a severe drought. The remakes over the years have been total crap. And I was not very hopeful about this one. But I was very wrong. I read some great reviews, but still wasn't convinced, so I decided to see for myself. Wow. Smart, intelligent script by Marti Noxon. And I was so glad to see that Tom Holland had a hand in it. Some people say it's a little slow in the beginning, but I can actually watch European movies so I don't mind a slow set up. Craig Gillespie shows here that he has a lot in common with Hitchcock. The car chase especially. The camera work here is amazing and very innovative. The score is also reminiscent of Bernhard Herman, believe it or not. I'm definitely going to be watching to see what Gillespie does next. And the acting is really top notch: Anton Yelchin, Imogen Poots, Toni Collette, and David Tennant all hit just the right notes every step of the way. But now for my favorite: Colin Farrell! Holy Moly! This guy is freaking incredible! He's a leading actor in a character actor's body! I've never seen such a chameleon! I've been checking out his other films, and I am absolutely blow away! You know I'm a lifelong film lover. Even going to acting/film school and I've just never seen anything like this guy. Going to see Horrible Bosses tomorrow. I hear he has a combover and a gut!! Oh well, if he can pull off a spot on Texas accent, sing country and play the guitar in Crazy Heart, well I'm sure I will have to pick my jaw off the floor...again. Really looking forward to the Total Recall remake now. Anyway if you haven't seen this film, you truly don't know what you're missing. I can't wait to see it again.",Fright Night
140,DJRumpy,"Oh my, what big teeth you have...",8,22 August 2011,"Being a fan of the original movie I wasn't sure what to expect here. I'm not the sort of person that gets upset about remakes. I just judge a movie on it's merits and leave those arguments to other so take this with a grain of personal preference in that regard.Fright Night revisited is a modern day retelling of the original story. Updated slightly but no overly so. The plot takes place in a suburb outside of Vegas. The story gets started very quickly, blending the meet and greet for the actors into the storyline very well so don't expect a lot of character development for the sake of development alone. A nice touch there and well executed. I can't flaw any of the actors here as they all did very well in the roles they were given with higher marks for Anton and David Tennant (Dr. Who fame).Anton Yelchin (Star Trek's Checkov) did a refreshing reprisal of the role of Charlie, except in this go round, he's not a total 'geek' as portrayed in the original, but rather has moved on to a young teen's life with a 'hot' girlfriend, and A-List friends. In that process he's apparently left behind his childhood friend Ed (Evil or as many of you will remember him, McLovin from Superbad). As the story starts, a new neighbor has already moved in and there is already a missing student or two at school. Ed (Christopher Mintz) blackmails Charlie into helping him investigate by threatening to expose Charlies young days of acting out role playing games with Ed to the detriment of his new popularity among his school mates. Things quickly ramp up from there.Ed (Evil) has a much shorter role in this remake and very little actual air time. Not a great performance but then again not a lot of screen time to get attached to his character either. An odd choice but not a drawback given the short screen time.Colin Farrell actually does a great job at being bad here. I was a bit surprised at the initial choice for Colin in this role but he pulls it out nicely with a great menace to his method so to speak. There's also a funny cameo by the original 'Jerry' (Chris Sarandon) which had the older crowd of Fright Night fans giggling. This version has some teeth (literally...lots of teeth). It has some great suspense moments and a great re-imaging of the original Peter Vincent that I thought went great with the modern feel of the movie.Not as much tongue in cheek as the original and definitely a darker tone than the original. This version is definitely not child safe. It has an deserved R rating.A good summer fare movie. Worth the price of admission ;)",Fright Night

142,matthewchermside,Cleverly Re-written - A new Spin on an Old Tale,7,29 December 2011,"I was pleasantly surprised by this film.As a young boy I was terrified by the original back in 1985, which I still love. This film takes the original story, makes some very subtle changes, throws in a little shock and gore for the modern audience, and still manages to add in a few chuckles too. Shame that the 'Evil' Ed character is criminally under-used though.I'm glad that this movie did not try to recreate pivotal scenes like the nightclub seduction scene between Jerry and Amy - that would have been impossible, not least because of the original's creepy Brad Friedel score and the ominous presence of Chris Sarandon - Farrell doesn't really come close to the original Jerry to be honest, but he is menacing in his own way.Farrell's Jerry is more muscle and menace than suave intelligent malevolence. I liked the cameo for Chris Sarandon, that made me smile a lot.This film was a good ride, but for a real fix of terror, check out the original film. Even though it has aged a bit, the lighting, smoke effects, brilliant musical score, the real sense of suburban terror in your own backyard, and even the performances are far more affecting than the remake. There is something lost from the original too by taking away the original Charley Brewster's horror film obsession - William Ragsdale was excellent as the paranoid obsessive teenager.In summary, this is a surprisingly good remake of a really under-rated classic horror film that was truly ahead of its time.",Fright Night
143,Curt-Rowlett,An Excellent Remake,9,17 August 2018,"Yes, I am a fan of the original 1985 version of Fright Night, so much so that I consider it as one of the best in the genre of vampire movies. I am not a fan of the majority of reboots/remakes of films, particularly when I feel that the original was great. So I had little hope that this version would be any good.I'm happy to report that I was mistaken. This new version of the story is done quite well, and adds in some new elements to the plot that I found refreshing. Actor Colin Farrell is sufficiently creepy in the role of Jerry, the vampire. And I liked the fact that the Peter Vincent character was morphed into a cheesy Las Vegas act and that he gets forced into becoming an actual - though largely reluctant - vampire hunter. Nice work, Nine stars!",Fright Night
144,jimmy2,Stick with the original,5,28 June 2012,"Chris Sarandon doesn't have to worry about this contender. His status as vampire supreme has not been usurped.This film is proof that having fancy computer graphics in a horror film are no substitute for the visceral 'just like being there' feel of inventive special effects that were utilized back in the Eighties. The movies that come to mind from that era are 'Nightmare on Elm Street', 'The Thing', and, of course, the original 'Fright Night'. The special effects work was amazing in those films with no computer trickery.David Tennant does his best, but Roddy McDowall made a much better Peter Vincent. Actually, Tennant isn't in much of the film compared to McDowall, so it's hard to maintain any sort of empathy for his character.If there's anything good that this movie has done, is that it invokes the good memories of the original, causing one to shut off the remake and start watching the real thing.",Fright Night
145,PsychoAndy75,"A good remake, but some magic is lost",6,15 July 2013,"Good remake of the '85 classic, but something was lost. Maybe you need a great actor like Chris Sarandon to make it work or may be you need the funny ""comedy"" situation, but it doesn't deliver the great amusement as the original! Farrel is not bad as the movie's vampire, but he's not able to be as charming and darkly ambiguous as Sarandon. It's not an easy job, Chris created one of the most realistic vampire of all times, but Craig Gillespie could take him to be a little less ""bad"" and a little more ""Gothic"". I mean: it's not ""30 days of night"", this vampire is not a ""wild animal"", we are talking of a centenarian man that can even love, in its way, a Gothic creature that can be charming.Same thing for ""the great vampire slayer"" Peter Vincent: here he is a boozer and quite a psychopath, not an actor out of business.Anyway the movie works, it's a good horror movie, I just wonder why making a remake if you change the story and character so drastically! It makes no sense to me!If it did not pretended to be a remake, with a slightly different story, it could have been considered an 8/10 movie!",Fright Night
146,DeaditeGaz92,"If you're expecting a great modern vampire flick then watch it, if you're expecting it to be like the original then stay far away...",8,8 September 2011,"*THIS REVIEW WILL CONTAIN SPOILERS*I've just came back from seeing this film in 3D and I have really mixed feelings about it, first of all I will start off by saying the things that I disliked about it.It was basically nothing like the original, and my main proof of this is the characters, at what point in the original did Peter Vincent act like Russell Brand? At what point in the original was Charlie Brewster a complete dick? At what point in the original was Ed the guy who started realizing that Jerry is a vampire? It just never happened so why did it happen in this?! The only character that really stayed the same was Jerry! Another thing is the time setting, I really would've preferred if this was set in the 80's so it would've been more like the original I mean seriously what was with the damn Twilight references? If you're gonna reference a vampire film then reference a proper vampire film like one of the old hammer horror vampire films or even the Lost Boys. Another thing I hated was the ending, I mean seriously what was with the ending?! They basically showed it in all the trailers and there was no point to it, nothing happened! I'm pretty sure with most horror films something interesting has to happen in the ending not just a couple making out in a vampire hunter/magician's hotel room.Now with the good stuff. The characters (although nothing like the old characters) work great as new characters, especially Peter Vincent he was a great addition to the film. One of the best actors in the film was definitely Colin Farrell because he was just like the original character that he's supposed to be and better, he was really creepy. The 3D in this film is awesome, especially the scenes that include ashes, they actually look like they're right in front of you. Another great thing was the suspense of the film it really does keep you on edge in most parts.Overall it really works as a standalone film and if they just called it Fright Night 3 and changed the names of the characters then I would've gave it a solid 9/10, but due to it being classed as a remake I'm gonna give it 7/10.",Fright Night

She is too good an actor to be in a cheesy vampire flick. To be honest I am befuddled by the rating and the good reviews that the movie is getting. It was neither scary nor funny. Colin Farrell does look convincing as a vampire, but the standout performance is surely by David Tennant who made it possible for me to smile a few times. All in all the movie fails to deliver. I expected something a little better I guess. Anton Yelchin is a good actor and a budding star who tries hard to salvage a little out of the night.

Hell, even the presence of Amanda Bearse wasn't too offensive !!On the other hand, I've just watched the remake and find it hard to believe that, even with some of the absolutely awful movies that are being released now, that this unutterable piece of crap could have EVER made it to a screen.There is NOT ONE likable character in this version, and to add insult to injury, they're all so badly played that you won't know whether to laugh or cry.All in all, unless you are a teenage girl with an IQ that pretty much matches your bra size, and thinks that the completely ridiculous ""Twilight"" things are ""Like, soooo coool, avoid this horror story of a horror story LIKE THE PLAGUE...which, come to think of it, probably would have been more fun to watch.",Fright Night

151,NightOwl0,This rip-off remake should never have been made in the first place.,1,10 August 2011,"I had the grave misfortune of attending an early preview screening for this piece of garbage. The audience I saw it with was less than enthused as well. I credit them with having some actual taste. I must disclose that I am a fan of the original film. In fact in the pantheon of great vampire movies I feel that ""Fright Night,"" stands tall as one of the best ever. It's a very clever idea for a vampire film and the original characters are a lot of fun. The original film is in many ways a love letter to horror films and horror fans. The main character in the original is a horror fan, his friends are horror fans and he idolizes Peter Vincent who is the host of a late night horror movie show. The film was post modern and gave the audience credit for having some kind of prior knowledge. Now we are confronted with this brain dead remake. It is hard to know where to begin in explaining how awful this new film is.We can start with the sad fact that the very essence of the original characters, their arcs and their dynamics have been changed almost completely. The main character, Charlie, is now a self-absorbed and selfish jerk. Charlie treats his much more intelligent friend Ed like human waste. Charlie has a hot girlfriend and is hanging out with a much more popular crowd. Ed's intellect and peculiarities set him apart so of course Charlie has to drop him as a friend. When a movie starts off and your protagonist is a fake and hateful cretin it is a serious problem. Then there is the character of Evil Ed himself who is unfortunately played by Christopher Mintz-Plasse. Mintz-Plasse has now given the exact same tiresome performance in God knows how many movies. In the original film Ed was a tragic character. In this one he is at best an annoyance. The main problem with the new characterizations lies in the re-imagining of Peter Vincent. He is now a Las Vegas magician who prances around like Russell Brand and almost seems like a complete afterthought in the film. Vincent's arc in the original movie was touching and central to the narrative's success. In this new incarnation he hardly drives the film at all. Like every other poor decision made by the filmmakers, the casting of David Tennant is merely a stunt to draw the geek crowd in. He might as well not even be in the picture. Colin Farrell is not a disaster as Jerry Dandridge, but he is hardly a success either. Chris Sarandon's portrayal was sly and full of little touches that really sold the implicit threat of Dandridge. Farrell is a very obvious actor and he gives a very obvious performance in this movie. His character is really more of a serial killer/sexual predator than a true master vampire. As the movie progresses he goes steadily over the top and seems less and less threatening for doing so. By the time he is chasing Charlie, Charlie's mom and Charlie's girlfriend on a motorcycle he might as well be The Terminator. His supernatural abilities rarely if ever come into play.The film has zero atmosphere and barely comes to anything approaching excitement. Product placement is rampant and so frequent that it becomes hilarious. The fun, new-wave Gothic feel of the original film has been replaced by a slick treatment more befitting a luxury car commercial. There is no edge to this movie. The computer effects are terrible and poorly rendered. The editing is desperate and the gotcha moments are lame in the extreme. I was so bored watching it I resorted to checking my watch every few minutes to see when the ordeal would be over. If you are thinking about viewing this abomination I would suggest streaming the original on Netflix or watching it for free on Hulu. Your time would be better spent and you will not have wasted thirty dollars or more on crappy, post-production 3D.",Fright Night

Within ten minutes, the film proved me wrong. Actually, it was so entertaining until I forgot it was a remake. New characters were added and the originals were more fleshed-out and appealing. Honestly, William Ragsdale's Charley wasn't very intriguing and always seemed worried and on-edge. Anton Yelchin's version is a laid back, kick ass kid who makes you want to see more of him in a sequel. Colin Ferrell made a more memorable Jerry Dandridge. He appears as a rugged construction worker instead of a charming pretty boy like Chris Sarandon. It was Evil Ed who stole the show as a vampire in the original. This time Evil plays second fiddle while Jerry is the greater menace like a master vampire should be. Don't worry about cheap scares with big booms. There's nothing but pure suspense all through out. The special effects were awesome and the gore was used in moderation. Fright Night shows that a remake doesn't always mean a disaster.",Fright Night
154,paul-heys-im,Fright Night Is Good,7,7 December 2015,"As a huge fan of the originals, I have to say, I was pleasantly surprised by this remake. Most remakes are terrible, in fact, I don't know why Hollywood insists on making remakes because they are money losers. All these remakes barely break even, if they do at all, and the film industry is over-saturated by pointless and ineffective remakes. Nevertheless, this is one remake that is actually worth watching. It takes the simplistic premise of the original, and gives it a modern day spin. The actors are all solid, especially David's Peter Vincent, who I actually like more than the original P.V, and he was great (Roddy rocks) and the script is competent. The fx are OK, although I'd have preferred less CGI and more prosthetics like the original, but the cgi is serviceable. Good soundtrack, too. All the ingredients that make a good popcorn flick, are there. It's an hour and a half of mindless vampire fun. And in the age of the vampire=romance, it's good to see a vampire on screen who is a straight up monster. The guy who plays Chris the mofo from Kick Ass is also in this film, and does a great job of playing a nerdy outcast who tips off his friend, Charlie, that Jerry is a ruthless killing machine with fangs. Even if you don't like the original, I suggest you see this film, it's a great, fun ride for what it is. No pretentious nonsense, no vampire romance, no pretty boy vampires, just some good, horror movie fun. It doesn't surpass the original, but is a close second. Colin Farrel is great as Jerry. It's time Hwood did more worthwhile remakes of cult classics which were failures upon their release back in the 1980's. There is a multitude of cult hits that could be improved upon and brought to a new audience but it seems Hwood are only concerned with remaking the films that did well, and destroying their superior originals in the process. But not to get sidetracked, I was expecting another crappy remake, but this film gets it right, for once.",Fright Night
155,stormcatcher-2,I think that vampire may be wearing dentures,5,8 January 2012,"I hate most remakes and revamps (or in this case, a re-vamp...sorry, Jerry), but in this case, I can actually understand why Hollywood decided to cash in, given how wildly popular all things vampire are right now (and ye GODS, will I ever be glad when this trend ends). And given that the chief writer on this was Marti Noxon, one of Joss Whedon's staff writers on ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"" - it treads the genre well enough. That being said, I'll chime in with the majority of the older folk here who preferred the original. And while Marti and her staff manage to throw in one or two surprises into the film, this didn't seem as fun as it did the first time around. ***POTENTIAL SPOILERS POSSIBLE, READ FURTHER AT YOUR OWN RISK***Probably my biggest issue with the film is that most of the main characters aren't quite as sympathetic as they were in the original. Rather than being a bit of a geek, the Charlie Brewster in this film is slowly ingratiating himself to the ""in"" crowd at his school (mostly thanks to his hot girlfriend), and in the process, he's fairly dismissive to his former friends - so when his pal ""Evil"" Ed expresses concern about a mutual friend of theirs disappearing, and several missing persons from their class in general, Charlie accuses him of being overly dramatic and paranoid - and when Ed claims that a vampire is the reason, Charlie thinks he's downright crazy. It takes Jerry testing the boundaries of Charlie's knowledge about vampires and putting Charlie's mother and girlfriend at risk before Charlie starts to believe the truth, and by then, you pretty much want to smack him up for being so stubborn in the first place.As Peter Vincent, David Tennant is a good deal more shallow and boorish than Roddy McDowall was in the role - and the sarcastic banter between him and his live-in...girlfriend? Wife?...is downright annoying. There doesn't seem to be any real reason for him to assist Charlie in his vampire hunt at first, and when the film DOES explain his change of heart later, it's almost a bit too coincidental. Still...it's fun to listen to the banter between him and Charlie, and the movie most certainly would have been far more dull without him.Colin Ferrell has sex appeal as Jerry, in a sleazy sort of way...and although he's definitely menacing, he also came across to me as desperate. Plus, I found it a little hard to believe that someone could blow up someone else's house, and you never saw a single fire engine or cop car show up, even after twenty minutes or so. Geez, it's the desert, but it's not the North Pole. And I miss the cheesy-yet-creepy atmosphere of the original Jerry Dandridge's house. That place LOOKED haunted, and while it definitely stood out in the neighborhood of more atypical homes, it fit its owner well. In this movie, Colin's place could have been sponsored by IKEA. It kind of defeats the purpose of having a home that blends in with the others around it if you're going to send your neighbor a statement of disapproval by blowing up HIS house, don't you think?There are a few unexpected surprises that the writers throw our way, but they're far too few and far-between. The scene where Charlie must try to rescue a female neighbor that Jerry is holding prisoner to feed off of is impressively tense, as is the final showdown between Jerry, Peter, and Charlie under Jerry's house. It really makes me wonder what Marti and her team might have accomplished if they had taken even more liberties with the original script.This is also a remake that suffers from overdone CGI. Especially when it comes to horror films, pretty pixels don't make for convincing scares. I think anyone who has seen the more recent remake of John Carpenter's take on ""The Thing"" can attest to that. And speaking of...John's movie itself was a remake, and a perfect example of taking the plot of the original in an entirely new and unexpected direction. (Take a note, Hollywood. That's how a remake SHOULD be done.)If you liked the original movie and got a kick out of ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"", this one is definitely worth a rental, but I don't see this one becoming a cult classic anytime soon.",Fright Night

As a country man of Colin Farrell I like to see him do well, but the man has the acting range of chicken that suffered a stroke. The Roddy McDowell role is taken up by a self absorbed David Tennant who is more annoying than what I assume was meant to be lighthearted (oh Dr.Who you have fallen so far).

I liked the scene where he turned Ed into a vampire. I liked when the hero's girlfriend threw holy water in his face. I liked the scene also where he killed some bullies and he had long claws. He was cool and handsome in his human form but super scary when we saw his monster face. Jerry the vampire is one of the best vampires. Right up there with Dracula, Blade, Edward Cullen, Lestat, Angel, Stefan and Damon Salvatore, Bill Compton, and Eric Northman. Colin Farrel gave a great performance. This is one of his best films alongside Daredevil, Horrible Bosses, Crazy Heart, and Hart's War. I'm glad he stopped drinking and doing drugs. I liked Anton Yelchin as the hero Charlie. I thought he was a jerk at first but he was nicer later in the film. I did not like how he treated his best friend Ed. They were the best of friends and then Charlie rejects him just because he's dating the hottest girl in school. I liked the mom played by Collette and it was bad when Jerry tried to kill her but I liked it when he burned their house down. He said he didn't need an invitation in if there was no house. I liked when he was stabbed with the realtor's sign and I liked the battle at the end with him Charlie and Peter Vincent. I only had one problem with the film. I thought David Tennant was funny bu his character Peter Vincent was better in the old one. He was an old man brilliantly played by Roddy Mcdowall. In this one he was an idiotic horn-dog who acted like Criss Angel. He was better in the end when he helped Charlie battle Jerry. I also liked Christopher Mintz Plasse. He was funny and it was cool when he became a vampire. I thought Fright Night was one of the best horror flicks in 2011. Everyone should see it.",Fright Night
158,totipota,I've seen 99 flops and Fright Night wasn't one,7,22 November 2011,"The other day I decided to go and watch ""Fright Night"" late after work. Unfortunately for me it was a 2for1 night and it was sold out and I end up watching the Three Musketeers in 3D. It was not as bad as I expected but two days later I went back to the cinema and got to watch the movie I initially wanted.Half way through I was resting my face on my fist and my eyes were rolling up and backwards trying not to fall asleep because the movie looked like something between Scream and Ikwydls and kind of sucked but then (SPOILER FOLLOWS) Mclovin becomes a vampire and David Tennant gets involved in the act. Most of the second half of the movie was quite good with some impressive moments and good action.What made my day and had me smiling and humming when getting out of the theater was the song during the credits. I know it's not what you are going to watch a movie for but I can say that listening to Hugo's version of 99 Problems and watching some of the movie's moments edited in a way that fitted the song, was a good boost for me to go ahead and give it a 7,5/10. 1 whole point added to my vote only thanks to that song. Not bad Hugo. By the way, I can't say I like Jay-Z's 99 problems but I like Jay-Z in general because he looks like Michael Batiste.So back to the movie to sum it up a bit. I got quickly bored because I misjudged it but then Craig Gillespie delivered. Second half was a great show and Mclovin (I don't even wanna know his real name) deserves an Oscar for having managed to make himself famous against all odds. I mean, he's very hideous but you can only love him for his roles at Superbad, Kick Ass and now Fright Night.Go and watch Fright Night. You'll probably not get scared but you'll get a good time and maybe a good laugh too. Download the song I keep talking about too.

159,texanvkg,Much Better Than Expected,7,24 March 2012,"The original has always been a favorite, and after getting burned on multiple re-imaginings over the last few years, I went into this film with some trepidation, not expecting much, and hoping that it was at least respectful to the source material.What a pleasant surprise! Excellent performances by Yeltin and Farrel and the wonderful, zany Tennant anchor and well-made vampire flick that captures the heart and humor of the original. I thoroughly enjoyed the movie, have no complaints, and was very happy to see Chris Sarandon appear in a cameo as the victim out on the highway.For those that love the original, this film does the first on justice and I recommend you set aside your fears and enjoy this film. For those that have not seen the original - watch this and have fun!",Fright Night

However, it's a waste of the talents of the 2 actors.Fright Night tells the classic story of vampires as it is, without much plot nor new ideas, making it boring and predictable. The main character is a good boy gone bad, but not so bad that the story becomes interesting. The only things to look forward to in this movie are probably Sandra Vergara (the younger sister of Sofia Vergara), the acting by the British actors, and the detailed CGI --which are actually not that much either.",Fright Night

Go into this without much expectation and you may just be surprised how much you can enjoy it.",Fright Night
163,mothygamer,One good performance can't make this a good movie,5,19 August 2011,"It took me a while to see the original Fright Night (1985). I had one of those mothers who tried to impose her own uneasiness with the horror genre on her children. Actually, she held crazy beliefs like that KISS stood for Knights in Satan's Service and Rush (the Canadian prog-rock band) meant Ruling Under Satan's House and is still afraid to watch the movie Jaws (1975). I'm pretty sure the first time I saw Fright Night '85 it was on cable television. I soon went out and and rented it – and its inferior sequel – and found a movie I really liked. It had the right amount of camp and humor, but it was the slow build to the horror element that made it, to me, a classic.Don't expect that from the new version. Fright Night '11 takes the same basic premise, but has none of the fun with it. Marti Noxon – the Queen of Mean – transplants the Angelus character from the Buffy/Angel Whedonverse and hands the role to a more talented actor in Colin Farrell. Let me make this perfectly clear: if you are going to see this movie, Colin Farrell is the reason to go. He does truly embody the inhuman menace of the shark from Jaws, but is somewhat hampered by the direction and editing that occasionally sets him up as a vampiric Pepé Le Pew. Though largely robbed of any kind of a backstory or motivation beyond being a vampire – and what little we do get to learn about his kind mostly goes to waste – Farrell does his best to make this movie work.The problem is that he isn't enough.Anton Yelchin, an actor who has yet to impress me in any role I've seen him in, is the lackluster lead. We learn that he is the kind of man who would betray his friends and hang out with assholes in order to score a tasty girlfriend, but still nerdy enough to not be able to close the deal. Seemingly, a mere ten minutes – it may have been a little more or less – Yelchin's Charley Brewster is already aware (in a way) that vampires are real. That sucks all of the tension out of the ensuing scenes and helps get the leaden feeling of the movie going. Yelchin does have a couple of good scenes, but he – or director Craig Gillespie – doesn't know what to do with them.Instead of giving an actor as good a role as they did with Roddy McDowell in the original, David Tennant (as Peter Vincent) is required to start off with what looks like a Ben Stiller impersonation of Johnny Depp in any of the Pirates movies. There is too much unpleasant self-loathing in this new Vincent to make him accessible. He is a pompous coward – which could have worked – that never really is given a chance for redemption; it is up Charley to do that, too.Imogen Poots (as Amy) and Emily Montague (as Ginger) make for attractive and mildly compelling potential victims of the vampire. Both seem to have unreasonable faith in the Charley character, though this is a problem with the screenplay and not the acting. Much less effective are the other potential victims that wander about the film. Most are disagreeable and unlikeable, and in the case of Dave Franco seem to be too old to fit into the film's high school age group characters. Toni Collette (as Charley's mother, Jane) is largely wasted. She looks good and should be a calm, capable, strong woman that has given Charley his moral compass and conviction. Instead, she is quickly turned into just another potential victim and is removed from the third act in an unsatisfying way (though, to be fair, it does work in the overall story). Chris Sarandon makes an appearance – my one lone laugh of the night – as does Lisa Loeb (???).The film looks bland and uninspired, and that isn't due to the special effects. The FX work, almost without exception. It is the sets and landscape that robs the movie of any sense of life. Watching a cookie-cutter, Las Vegas McMansion in an oddly isolated subdivision burn provokes no reaction from me, except that many built unwisely during the housing boom. There is no vibrancy to the movie, and that is a problem. I cannot comment about the 3D. There was a problem with the projection during the previews, and while it was resolved to the point of where it wasn't just blurry, most of the effects that were in 3D never really popped. Some are obviously meant to, and if they do it will add more to the experience. Other than those flashy (and repetitive) sequences, there are only three or four shots that effectively make use of the technology (no, I am not counting the crossbow bolt shot seen in the previews). Gillespie does a great job with one particular shot in a swimming pool early on, then seems to degenerate into some level of amateurism with his shot selection. This is his first feature, and in retrospect, it looked as though he wasn't ready.My suggestion is to watch the original Fright Night (1985) instead of the cynical, cold-hearted '11 Fright Night. The new one isn't horrible, but like a vampire, it has no life of its own. Colin Farrell is great in what he is allowed to do (I never thought I'd ever write a sentence like that), but the rest of the cast is subdued and improperly handled. This is a solid C effort, but I would have like to have seen a more accomplished director – and definitely no Noxon influence – for this movie.",Fright Night
164,bakor24-1,fast paced kill,7,15 July 2012,"The movie does not waste time to get to the heart of the action. There is a quick and well balanced introduction to the heart of the subject matter, and the audience is not left waiting to experience suspense. Collin Farrell does a great job at playing a charismatic, but dangerous, neighbor that pulls the family and audience straight in to the action. The cast is well chosen, there's no doubt about it – a collection of teenagers that refuse to accept a nerd's truth about vampires, a magician in Vegas, and a few more. It has been a while since I last saw any horror film, and I smiled when I felt fear come over me. The fear doesn't come alone though, there is a hefty dose of comedy and an impressive amount of action. The film is definitely fast paced and dynamic as the settings change continuously in a fluid manner, and there's a generous dose of vengeance fueled gory action that would leave any audience with a feeling of satisfaction. Collin's a sexy guy, but when he's a monstruous mean character, you want to see him suffer. No spoiler intended, but in the confrontations, he takes it as much as he dishes it, and the result is fun. Enjoy!",Fright Night
165,Harleyflhrc,Best Horror Remake I've seen in a LONG time,8,24 August 2011,"Like most of the reviewers posting on here, I was a big fan of the original that came out my freshman year in college, and when I heard that yet another 80's movie was being remade, I immediately thought of the new Friday the 13th and Nightmare on Elm Street, both of which fell FAR short of the originals. This one is MUCH better. It stays true to the original, and the movie is paced fairly quickly. A great scene is a cool cameo appearance by the original Jerry Dandridge, Chris Sarandon, although this time he is on the other side of the fangs. The setting in the decimated real estate market of Las Vegas was an excellent thought, and makes the movie quite believable and more entertaining. The only disappointment, and it is a small one, is the new Amy is not nearly as scary as a Vampire as the original one was. This film has excellent modern touches to bring it up to date. Well done!",Fright Night

No one can replace the Great Roddy Mcdowell but for me that particular role (Peter Vincent) was the big negative in this remake.
This one he's sad sack magician the kids try to convince. In The Original at least he was a TV vampire chaser.
Every time he was on the screen the movie went several notches down for me.

The acting is top notch, the efx were pretty neat, I likes how at the end they had Amy look the same as her ""vamp look"" the same as in the original(the big goofy smile with the sharp teeth).The appearance of Chris Surrandon(the original Jerry) was awesome, i was kind of sad that he got killed, but still.One person I want to give tremendous amounts of credit to is Collin Farrel(Jerry). He adapted the part so well, he was just one badass dude, he didn't try to play a nice guy or anything, he just went straight for the neck.

169,fca182,This is how remakes should be done,9,21 August 2011,"With so many bad horror movies, and especially so many bad vampire movies, I can't deny I was a bit skeptical about this one. But, I had seen the original as a kid (I haven't seen it a again in at least a decade) so I was curious, and since it had such a great cast I saw it.To my surprise it was great! Let me start out by saying I don't think I ever enjoyed Colin Farrell so much in any other movie as I did here! He's the perfect choice for a vampire, its really almost as is he was born for this role, he steals every scene in this movie. Everybody else is great as well, Anton Yelchin is as great as he is any role, David Tennant (who I've never seen before) was fantastic too, he's got a bit of a 'Russell Brand' character going on (without ever copying him) and it works really well. Anton's mom and girlfriend are also phenomenal and completely believable. I would say the weakest performance is from Christopher Mintz-Plasse, not because he's bad, he gets the job done, its just that I can't see him different enough from McLovin.The story stays true the original, but it gives us enough 'modern re-telling' and character development to still feel like its own movie. The vampire designs are awesome, still true to the originals, just way better. Enough stuff in there for the horror fans, but it also has the comic relief that made the first one a classic.The 3D is better than in quite some films, but I wouldn't recommend seeing it 3D. Why? The movie itself is mostly dark in colors (most of the film is in nighttime) and the 3D glasses make it even darker.I really enjoyed this film and would gladly watch it again and recommend to anyone. 8.5/10",Fright Night
170,melseele,This is a must see!,9,18 January 2013,"If you are a fan of Colin Farrell, then you have to see this movie. I can't imagine any one else playing the vampire but Colin. Colin did a great job in being the bad guy. The way that he walked and talked was awesome! He played a very believable vampire (would love to get bit by Colin!) and his acting was truly incredible. I had never seen a movie with David Tennant before but am a fan now. I loved how he went from a super sexy vampire killer to an ordinary Joe. How brilliant to have his character remove his persona on film by taking off his tattoos, etc. To be honest, this movie wasn't what I thought it would be, but it didn't disappoint. I thought it would be a really scary movie and was very pleased to find that it had a comedic side. I would truly recommend this movie be watched. Don't understand why people can't watch a movie for entertainment without being a critic about everything. Just watch a movie and be entertained, that is how a movie should be viewed.",Fright Night
171,cls0680,"Fun movie, good re-imagination",7,4 November 2015,"A lot of people have slammed this for not being true to the first one, but I think that's the good part of it. Its like a good song cover, it takes the original and doesn't just copy cat it, it changes a few things, gives it a personal twist, without totally destroying the integrity of the original. There are a lot of connections that were made obvious, but not ridiculously obvious. The biggest difference between them is this one is more vampire, and less love. If you're expecting a love story, or seduction, watch the original. That is the biggest difference - Jerry uses Amy, Jerry doesn't love Amy.This was a fun, updated version, which - I thought - made more sense than the first. It had more back story, anyway, so you understood why Jerry chose that neighborhood, and not just ""oh a vampire moved in randomly."" Sarandon's Jerry was like a 1980's GQ mag highlighting sweater fashion. Sideways glances in half lighting and talk of love and pain constantly. I was always more afraid of his little friend, who seemed more devious. Collin Farrel is definitely more menacing and believable as a shrewd killer vampire. Sometimes he is uneasy and jittery, followed by a relaxed ""cool"" and it keeps it uncomfortable in a good way. And his ""animal"" responses are unexpected, natural, and appreciated. The rest of the cast was also excellent, I thought. The real star is easily David Tennant who is hilarious, and you have to love him. Christopher Mintz-Plasse twist on ""Evil"" was good and believable, I felt much more for him than I did in the first movies. I really never ""got"" Evil in the first movie, but this one makes him much more real and not just an obnoxious hyperactive sidekick. Imogen Poots' ""Amy"" was such an improvement on the first movie's Amy who was SO whiny and annoying.If you watch movies specifically for special effects, you can pass on this one. The effects are not good. Bad CGI. And some things, in retrospect don't make much sense - and I think those things are mainly the character's responses. I kept thinking ""why is he not more upset about this?"" or ""why didn't someone notice this?"" or ""Really - no one is questioning this??"" BUT, the movie itself is pretty good and if you overlook the bad effects and the unrealistic lack of concern sometimes, you'll probably like it and have fun watching it. You had to have some kind of ability to overlook stupidity to watch the first one anyway, right?",Fright Night

I think everybody can remember certain scenes from the 1985 version that today would still be nasty enough to make us do the ""I'm eating lemon face"" and look away from the screen.With all that background I had hope that the 2011 version would be, maybe not as shocking as the original, but at least a good remake with one or two ""lemon faces"". Certainly I was wrong. This version is limited in all the possible ways, Colin Farrel got this part just because the vampire character had to be sexy and provocative, I can't think of another reason for choosing him for this role.The reason that made Toni Collette accept this role is beyond my imagination (needing money, Toni?)Anyway, if you saw the 1985 version, do yourself a favor and avoid this one.",Fright Night

174,mitesh-sahu,More Gory and Less Scary than the Original!,5,21 December 2011,"The 2011 movie has got more gore and cheap thrills than the 1985 movie. All that the former had was a couple of scenes that actually scared me, that too due to the sound effects involved. It was more of shock than fear. Let us be very frank about one thing, a horror movie is meant to scare you deep inside. The 2011 movie is a remake and a very poor one at that. It did not contain any of the spine-chilling elements that were in the original. I will just compare one scene and let the audience decide if the comparison holds good. In the 1985 movie, there is a scene when Charlie, as a voyeur is looking at a couple making love. Suddenly, he sees fangs appear in the guy's mouth and he starts sucking blood out of the girls neck. The next thing he knows is the girl is oscillating in equilibrium of pain and pleasure that is when Charlie sees a claw pulling down the blinds which leaves Charlie flabbergasted and filled with nothing but horror. The scene is equally horrifying to the audience watching it. There are many more such instances throughout the 1985 movie that leaves the viewer with no choice but to be scared. As each minute passes one gets more and more fearful of what is going to happen to the protagonist in due course of the movie. This creepy feeling was missing in the new version. There is a major difference in the way one feels when Chris Sarandon says ""Welcome to Fright Night, For Real!!"" and the way Colin Farrell says it at the climax. Now about the performances, Collin Farrell is a very good actor and he does a good job with the scope he has got, but there is no character development at all, fair enough! The director may not have felt the need to develop Jerry's character because it is a remake. Anton Yelchin was again decent enough in portraying the scared teenager, Charlie Brewster. David Tennant, Imogen Poots and Toni Collet too manage to pull off decent performances as Peter Vincent, Amy and Jane Brewster. Christopher Mintz-Plasse as Ed became redundant after the swimming pool scene; it seems that the director only needed him to make Charlie feel guilty about not helping a friend. There is however very little doubt,that the 1985 version of the movie was scarier. The performances of Chris Sarandon and William Ragsdale had set a benchmark which makes it difficult for the audience to forget and forgive the makers of this modern and less decent effort at making a classic teenage horror movie ""Fright Night"".",Fright Night
175,TonyH1939,Great remake of two vampire classics,9,19 May 2015,"This 2011 version of the latter-day classic _Fright Night_ is as good a time you will have watching a vampire movie these days. The cast is great, the direction fast paced and the script witty and reverent at the same time. And, while it is a remake of my favorite vampire movie of the 1980s, it is also pays homage to the best American vampire movie ever, _The Night Stalker_.While Charlie Brewster is getting the week-willed Peter Vincent to help him save Amy from Jerry Dandridge (""Jerry the vampire!?!""), the movie is also quoting pretty liberally from that classic 1972 Darren McGavin/Richard Matheson masterpiece. The new Fright Night shares a setting (Las Vegas) with the McGavin movie. But more importantly, the first half of the long sequence when Charlie searches Jerry's house and becomes a believer is an almost shot-for-shot quote of McGavin's suspenseful search of the vampire's house at the climax of _The Night Stalker_. Of course, the new movie has its own payoff to that scene, one that elicits a shudder and a laugh. The laugh comes from the fact that we should certainly have seen that payoff coming, but the suspense of the action just prior has thrown us off guard. This scene, like most of the effects shots, works even better in the original 3D.There are many other pleasures to this movie, including solid performances by Anton Yelchin, Imogen Poots and Toni Colette as the frightened but sophisticated protagonists. Colin Farrell is able to pull off a modern version of the Dandridge character, sexy in a rougher, sweatier way. He may not have the gravitas of Chris Sarandon, but Charlie is right to be wary of this guy, vampire or not.David Tennant and Christopher Mintz-Plasse steal the show. Tennant updates Peter Vincent by turning McDowell's kindly but cowardly gentleman into a drunken primadonna, Simon Cowell as vampire slayer. And Mintz-Plasse's Evil Ed is hilarious in nerd mode and vampire/nerd mode. His longing for a lost friend is very real and makes his fate all the more touching.If you have not seen this, check it out. For some reason it did not do well at the box office, but it is the perfect antidote to the sparkling vampires and cuddly werewolves of recent years.",Fright Night

I had never seen the original Fright Night.It wasn't all attempts to add stupid humor in with horror. It made me jump, and there were some funny moments, but it was more horror; which I enjoyed and did not expect.The acting was pretty good (another surprise for me, then again I had been expecting some cheesy vampire movie) and the make-up fx were beautifully done.My only real complaint would be the CG effects. Sure, some of it was pretty good, but the overall was disappointing. Not nearly as bad a sparkly vampires, but that's a different story.Overall, I do suggest this movie.

At first, when I heard the premise, it didn't seem original under any circumstances. And finally I saw the trailer and instantly couldn't wait to see it. Fright Night is a sleek, modern, edge-of-your-seat thriller with a few comical points. The storyline starts quickly and doesn't let up until the intense finale. The movie relays more on the characters and what they're going through than on blood and gore. The casting is also very well chosen. Anton Yelchin plays his part well but in my opinion the spotlight is on Colin Farrel who I think is possibly the coolest vampire in any movie so far. He plays the part extremely well. I wouldn't have minded a little bit more of Christopher Mintz-Plasse. Overall, the movie is a sleek, somewhat original, teen vampire flick that lives up to its potential.",Fright Night

Hollywood has an awful record with successful remakes. It was only after I walked out of the theatre that I realized how mislead I was.Now, usually I have a lack of respect for directors who do remakes because I always believed it showed how low creativity is these days. But for Fright Night, it was different. The film truly showed how it is possible to take a good idea, and, in ways, make it better. Because while the movie does follow all the main characters and basic concepts of the first movie, it also takes up a story of its own and is told very differently from the original. Although I will not spoil any of the movie for those of you reading this, I will beg you to go pick up a copy of Fright Night and experience what I did: a smart, simple, down to earth horror movie with that little bit of comedy that adds the perfect tone-something we haven't seen in the film industry for quite awhile.Overall great remake, looking forward to many more viewings to come.",Fright Night

181,nevthur,lifeless disposable remake of a beloved cult classic,2,19 August 2011,"Somewhat mildly entertaining, but compared to other recent horror films like Incidious, this movie is about as scary as an episode of Wizards Of Waverly Place.Most remakes suck, that's just reality, and this fails to disprove it.The original, which was by no means a Lost Boys, was, for the time, a seamless blend of horror, comedy, superb (but now outdated) special effects, and a new wave soundtrack to fit the time and place the film was made. It was as creepy and campy as the 60's and 70's Hammer Horror films which it pays homage as well as making fun of.But, beyond that, the original had a solid story line, with multiple characters with multiple motives. Gone is the creepy ""Evil"" Ed who, despite being a horror fan, refuses to believe Charlie that his next door neighbor is a vampire. In his place is another one-note performance by a character who serves more as wallpaper and who is a sad joke when he turns vampireGone is the charming and subtle Jerry Dangridge and instead we have a single-note boring one dimensional Collin Ferral who spends the entire film walking with heavy footsteps and hissing like a cat. Gone is Danridge's zombie day-time protector who added an even greater dimension of story layers replaced by, well, nothing.Gone is the charming Peter Vincent a cowardly tired old B-movie star who faces his fears to become a hero, replaced by yet another one-dimensional ex-Dr. Who.And perhaps most important of the omissions of this boring life-less remake is that of the big creepy decrepit American-Gothic old mansion in the heart of suburbia (like a tiny virus, and a metaphor for the vampire, which goes on to be so many other metaphors I can't list them all here).The original is dated, no freaking duh! Because it captured the essence of the time (date) and place it was created. The remake fails to even be dated because the sets and atmosphere are so lifeless this film could have been made anywhere between 1990 and now.The original is a ""cult film"" and so, by definition, it only has a small cult of fanatics, so, if you don't get why the original is so beloved then you're in majority of people who just don't get it.20 years from now this sad remake will be sitting in the Walmart $5.00 bin, cast aside by all those but Collin Farrel fans.P.S. the computer animated blood splashes are horrible, they look like mid 90's effects. Also, where's the remake of Brad Fiedel's ""Come To Me"" which was in the original as well as it's sequel? They must have been crazy not to put an update of that in the film. It's up there with Bela Lugosi's Dead and Cry Little Sister. Oh, and one finally little update: Imagine Poots IS actually very hot and a wonderful actress as was Amanda Bearse at the time.",Fright Night

184,emailjnm,A Memorably Exceptional Horror Remake (the First of its Kind),9,7 August 2011,"Remaining in the same vein as many recent horror outings, ""Fright Night"" is more of an eerie action comedy than a straight-out scare fest. Good. That's my favorite type, especially considering scares in and of themselves hardly garner a pull anymore. Also, with a title like ""Fright Night,"" we have an understanding with the filmmakers that we're getting one of those throwback horror flicks. You know, the ones that gave the horror genre that fun movie-going reputation it had in the 80′s before tasteless gore and tiresome predictability defiled the genre? This film succeeds on that promise, quickly turning itself into the quintessential ""fun"" horror flick perfect for Friday night.Styled after Alfred Hitchcock's ""Rear Window"" (which inspired its own modern retelling, ""Disturbia"") with a suave vampire living next-door instead of a mysterious stranger, this plot is very similar to its original. Charley Brewster (Anton Yelchin; ""Star Trek"") is a ex-nerd who has joined 'the cool crowd,' dropping his oldest friend ""Evil"" Ed (Christopher Mintz-Plasse; ""Kick-Ass"") for a hot cheerleader girlfriend (Imogen Poots; ""28 Weeks Later""). Things are looking oh-so-grand for the little flake (I mean, come on, any guy who hurtfully tells his friend ""the day my life got better was the day I stopped hanging with you"" is well a douche), he gets a new next-door neighbor that his mom (Toni Collette; ""The Sixth Sense"") takes a liking to: Jerry Dandrige (Colin Farrell; ""Horrible Bosses""). Now Jerry seems like a cool guy, but as we all know, you don't cast Colin Farrell to be your average next-door neighbor. Ed's attempts to convince Charley that Jerry is actually a vampire fail, but when Ed himself goes missing and Jerry shows proof of what he is, Charley goes to the only person who might have the answer: Peter Vincent (David Tennant; ""Doctor Who""), the Las Vegas magician who boasts of supernatural knowledge on how to kill vampires.The choice to modernize the original 1985 ""Fright Night"" doesn't like that bright an idea considering the current rule that all horror remakes suck, but somehow this became a unique effort due to diligent actors, a reliable director, and successful laugh and scare gags. It is, without exaggeration, the first great entry in the long line of atrocious horror remakes. It takes what we liked about the original and comes up some clever changes that update the story 26 years to the present.From an ingenious kill method at the end to wickedly suspenseful chase scenes, ""Fright Night"" boasts some surprisingly memorable scenes – some of which are incredibly suspenseful considering we think we should know what to expect from a vampire thriller. The opening is a startling 3D shot through dark thunderclouds that ends in an impeccably-executed family massacre. With Craig Gillespie's (the outstanding director of ""Lars and the Real Girl"") imaginative direction and Ramin Djawadi's (scorer of ""Iron Man"" and ""Mr. Brooks"") jarringly effective and wholly memorable musical score, the film hits all the beats it strives for with manic zeal.The all-star cast deliver a gratifying romp of suspense and chuckles, but the movie belongs to its villain and its anti-hero, Colin Farrell and David Tennant. The rest give solid performances (especially Mintz-Plasse), but they pale compared to the main act.Colin Farrell, when given the opportunity, revels in the grittiness of villainy whenever he can. For Jerry Dandrige, Farrell is at an all-time evil high and unchains his dark side. Part Hannibal Lector in his charming menace and part Buffalo Bill in his vicious brutality, Farrell carves himself a sweetly unpredictable part filled with great moments (from his menacing way of asking for a six-pack of beer to his ultimate way of overstepping house invitation rules to a great moment where his decision to do absolutely nothing produces far worse results).The fascinating part about Jerry is he isn't like regular vampires. He seems more inspired by the worst of modern serial killers than mythical killing machines, with his secret torture rooms and closet full of dozens of uniforms signifying authority (from firemen to the post office to the police). He's modern without being ""Twilight."" He's a ominous hulking mass. Those characteristics mixed together with his bizarre personality create a rather unique Hollywood vampire. Due to this, I wish the ""transformation"" to full-on vampire face was never included, as it is poor CGI and takes away from Farrell's menace.David Tennant, who I will admit I adore as the 10th Doctor Who, is a cinematic gem. His acting style has always been that of a Shakespearean extremist, and I can't think of a better role that has such obvious wicked glee in allowing him to let loose. There is something strangely mesmerizing in Tennant's scenes as the vulgar magician-turned-vampire-killer, especially in his first big scene where his vehemence and wide-eyed enthusiasm is outstandingly exaggerated. Also, seeing him acting with a giant shotgun is way more fun than I expected it to be. He's about as entertaining – if not more so – than the performance given by Roddy McDowall.In the end, what really matters about this movie? Is the movie suspenseful and thrilling? Yes, especially when Jerry really is allowed to let loose his menacing charm and kill with the same love of general violence of a ""Reservoir Dogs"" character. Is the movie funny when it tries to be? Absolutely. The pop culture references – especially in a crack on ""Twilight"" and comparing Jerry to the shark from ""Jaws"" – work particularly well. This is a huge amount of fun. So if you walk into this expecting the right kind of movie, ""Fright Night"" is that perfect Friday night scare.",Fright Night
185,Sharicespieces,"If you thought the previews looked cool, like I did...",5,20 August 2011,"then be prepared to think it's not cool anymore. Everything happens within the first 10 minutes; McLovin' gets killed and we're shown that Colin Farrell is in fact a vampire. After this, my friend and I literally turned to each other and said, ""What?"". Obviously I knew he was a vampire from the previews, but why did they give it up so fast? The story isn't centered on him, it's centered on the kid, Charley, trying to beat him. So shouldn't we have some sort of suspense or surprise in that area? Like finding out he's a vampire when Charley does? Also, the dialogue is so awkward. I heard pity laughs in the theater. The way Charley's ""cool"" friends talked was so forced and out-of-date. It's over-the-top cliché teen speak that's never actually been used by teens. And his conversations with McLovin' were dull and awkward and didn't have any sort of real-ness or even movie-ness in them. It was stale banter.In terms of story, it would have been 50% better had they stuck to the conventions. It was just so incoherent and un-relatable (we ARE supposed to be able to relate to it even though it's about vampires) They (the writers) should have kept McLovin' alive, and had him convince Charley that Jerry (Colin Farrell) is a vampire. And Jerry should have at least tried to hide it, instead of gallivanting around killing people the second he moved into the neighborhood. It would have been more fun to see their attempts to uncover Jerry and beat him at his own game. Rather than having no room for the audiences' imagination and guesswork. It wasn't an adventure at all. McLovin's character was one of the most entertaining in the movie. It would have been more fun to see him and Charley's dynamic (although a cliché one; enthusiastic believer vs in-denial non-believer) grow. Because that was the only chance the story had for there to be an interesting dynamic. Charley vs Jerry was very clear-cut and out in the open, except for the maybe 10 minutes of screen time where he has to hide it from his mother and girlfriend. Overall, it wasn't as cool as it seemed in the previews. The tone nor mood really matched up. Plus there's a ridiculous ""vampire slayer"" (not in the 'so corny that it's funny' way, more in the 'so dumb that it's dumb way') who decides at last minute to help Charley. I think that part was written for Russell Brand or something. It was awful.The movie had potential though. Being set in a desert suburb of Las Vegas made it kind of cozy and undertoned the isolation of the neighborhood. However, the story just fell apart and there were awkwardly placed scenes with his mother at the end of the movie that didn't ""wrap things up"" the way it was meant to, and instead made us think something was about to happen to his mother. It didn't play on expectations like it could have. In fact, its lack thereof lead it to falsely create expectations that were never met.Oh well.",Fright Night
186,chatterbox3,Really fun and entertaining,8,24 September 2011,"I haven't had this much fun at the cinema in a long time. I understand that people who loved the remake might feel this was a disappointment (whether it's because they went in ready to hate it or went in expecting to love it, I don't know) But I just thought it was a lot of fun. Probably more fun than funny (though some of the jokes did have me and the rest of the cinema laughing out loud). It was a good mix of light hearted humour, thrilling suspense and bloody action.Don't go in expecting too much and you'll have a good time.

187,upstreamtuna,A fresh breath for vampire movies,8,5 September 2011,"I haven't seen the original. But, I haven't seen a good vampire movie since ""Let the Right One In"" in 2008. With all the ""Twilight"" crap steaming up the Hollywood industry, it felt SO good to breathe a breath of fresh air while watching a vampire movie.The plot sticks to basic: A vampire moves in next door to a teenage boy, and when certain suspicions arise, said teenager learns that his next door neighbor is a vampire.The characters are SO great. You have Charley, the nerd turned jock played by Anton Yelchin. Jerry, the harmlessly named vamp, played by Collin Ferrell. Evil Ed, the geeky friend of Charlie that has been tracking Jerry for weeks, played by Christopher Mintz-Plasse. Jane, Charlie's mother, played by Toni Collette. Amy, Charlie's popular girlfriend, played by Imogen Poots. And last but certainly not least, Peter Vincent, the wannabe vampire hunter who's parent's were killed by vampires, played by David Tennant (who easily steals the show with every scene he's in).This movie is horrific and creepy at times, and super funny at others. The main cast is great and the story is good. I just wish they would have given a little more time for the suspense to build up around Jerry. It felt like it jumped fast from the start to where the story really starts to pick up speed, and then this movie is over just as fast as it began. That is my only gripe.Other than that, it is good. Better than Shark Night 3D, and Conan. If you go to the theater anytime soon, see this one. 4/5",Fright Night
188,pretzelcup,A gleefully gory and highly entertaining remake,7,16 September 2011,"In this remake of the 1985 cult classic, Anton Yelchin stars as Charley, a likable yet misguided young man who after witnessing his friend's murder becomes convinced that his new neighbour Jerry (Collin Farrell) is a vampire. His incessant pleas with his mother (Toni Collete) and his girlfriend (Imogen Poots) to believe him fail continuously until Jerry turns his sights on them and they are forced to confront him with the help of a foul mouthed vampire slayer (David Tennant). It's wonderful to finally see again a good old fashioned vampire movie, where the vampires are portrayed as blood hungry killing machines, rather than broody, gentle souls with skin that shimmers in the light. Craig Gillespie (Lars and the Real Girl) really pulls it off in this gleefully gory and slick horror/comedy. David Tennant and Collin Farrell are both spectacular as the drunken supernaturalist and the terrifying vampire respectively. But unfortunately the film did have a few little problems, for one I found Anton Yelchin's performance really quite lacking, and also there was quite a few elements of a predictable cheesy teen comedy in there. But all and all Fright Night proved to be quite an entertaining film and a lot of fun to watch with friends.7/10",Fright Night

Anton did not do a very good job at bringing out his character, he looked very out of place and did not fit. Remakes are very hard to do, the ending was PLAIN AWFUL! It was a selfish ending! That did not flow with the movie I love in the original how a cliff hanger was there so that a part two could happen.

190,sambio08,A Well Done Remake.,8,7 April 2012,"WARNING MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS!!!. The Fright Night original back in 1985 is a classic vampire movie that took old traditions and cliché's from older vampire movies and then mixed it into one big film. I thought the original was pretty good and enjoyed the goofiness, spooks and suspenseful thrill ride horror theme that it offered. When i heard there was a remake i wasn't to pleased but i still wanted to see it though but i was still under age when it was in cinemas at that time and i had to wait till it came out on DVD. I just watched it and i thought it was also pretty damn good. It followed the same storyline and characters but there both different. The story is simple a teenager named Charley who lives in a suburban neighbour hood gets a new neighbour named Jerry, right next door, who he later discovers that his neighbour is a blood sucking vampire, Jerry also finds out that Charley is aware of what he is and from then Jerry is on the hunt after his mother, girlfriend and HIM! (in the original he's only after Charley, his friend Evil Ed and his girlfriend Amy, also Peter Vincent near the end). Charley from the original and the remake are both different, In the original he loves horror movies and knows a lot about them and he's not that popular in school (correct me if I'm wrong) but in the remake he's just a cool kid who doesn't believe or know much about vampires but his friend Evil Ed in the remake does, whether in the original he was just his goofy friend. I liked Charley and Ed in both the original and the remake because there different but we all know when we see Ed in the remake he will always be MClovin. Jerry in both the remake and original were also good, both were just as intimidating, frightening and well there both the main antagonist. I thought the relationship between Charley and Amy was much stronger in the remake, true the original was also a spoof to the vampire genre but c'mon in the original i found her a little annoying and never cared about her (in my opinion). So yeah i though Amy was better in the remake. Peter Vincent i loved in both versions, the original classed him as a classic vampire hunter just like Van Helsing, in this he's just a jerk and hilarious but likable and at the end of course he becomes a hero and helps Charley. The mother i never cared for so skip that. The vampires i thought were better in the original and by that i mean the design, they looks more monstrous and creepy, there were also a werewolf and a giant bat in it and thats just plain awesome. In the remake they tried to recapture the ugly monstrous face but it's nothing special, I'm just glad that they didn't just have fangs and black eyes through out the entire movie and some of the effects were abit goofy but thats the fun of it. The setting was OK but i prefer the original setting much more. Now I'm going to talk about the final showdown between Charley and Peter against Jerry because i laughed at this a little but in the original they killed him by breaking windows and broken pieces of the house to set the sunlight beams on Jerry causing him to melt and explode. In the remake Charley has a suit on which has a wear resistance to fire, there stuck in a big beam of sunlight underground with vampires surrounding them and Jerry waiting for them. Peter then sets fire to Charley's suit with basically turns him into the human torch, he lunges at Jerry burning him alive and flying around the basement, Charley then eventually stakes Jerry in the heart turning him into ash. I laughed at this because it was just crazy, i never expected it and it made me enjoy this movie more. So finally, i thought the original and the remake were both equally good, they were different and it they both fit in with there timelines, the original 1985 fits in with the 80's and 90's and the remake is good for the modern age. So yeah give Fright Night the remake a watch it's a fun movie just like the original and a well made vampire movie.",Fright Night

All the way through the movie there are crude sexual comments made. There was no purpose to using the word ""pussy"", or talking about the graphics of sex. It's as if the movie writers wanted to put some smut in the movie just to make the teens go, ""tee hee"". There are some very talented actors in the movie. Unfortunately you don't get to see them do anything that would be considered a good representation of their true talent. I haven't seen the first fright night made in the 80's, but I bet that it was better.

Spoiler; When this movie get to 3rd act it basically prefer CGI action over substance or real horror. which is a shame because it had potential at least to be a much better film but Colin firth no matter what was bringing it down plus a weak script.

193,lakini71,Welcome to Fright Night 2011,8,20 August 2011,"It has occurred to me that when people refer to a new ""reimagining"" of a beloved film, they use the term ""unnecessary remake."" I've been guilty of that myself. I really tend to think, however, that technically any remake is unnecessary. No one ""needs"" to be told what is basically the same story (in most cases) twice. I've also heard the argument that bad films are the ones that should be remade, not good ones. I can understand that to an extent, but do people really want to sit through a new version of something they hated the first time? No remake is going to make everyone happy; it's just not possible. Unless of course, you haven't SEEN the original.So, just how should a remake be judged? As a stand-alone film, or how it compares to a previous one we love so much? And I do love writer-director Tom Holland's 1985 vampire flick FRIGHT NIGHT. It is just the right mix of comedy, terror, suspense, terrific performances, and an affection for old-fashioned scares. Many others have fond memories of it as well, so I relate to the ""why""s and the ""oh don't screw it up""s, and the ""leave it alone""s. After all, beloved films are dumped on all the time by would-be filmmakers out to make a quick buck for the safe Hollywood studios.Most of the central story is intact: Anton Yelchin leads the cast as Charley Brewster, a used-to-be high-school misfit who comes to the realization, thanks to childhood buddy Ed (Christopher Mintz-Plasse) that his new neighbor Jerry (Colin Farrell) is a vampire. It isn't long before he's convinced his single mother (Toni Collette) and his girlfriend (Imogen Poots) of this discovery...at which point all sorts of bloody hell breaks loose.Screenwriter Marti Noxon has infused a basic story (whose plot points and situations weren't always very believable) with some new smarts, including adding more depth to the central characters. And the setting has changed to a cookie-cutter suburb of Las Vegas, where people sleep during the day, work at night, and are much more transient. Another interesting change is the character of Peter Vincent. In the original, Roddy McDowall played a hammy horror host and actor: Peter Vincent, the Great Vampire Killer. Here, David Tennant assumes the role, but Vincent has become an elaborate Vegas magician who performs vampire-killing antics on the stage. In both versions, they are recruited by our hero to help slay the bloodsucker. It's an ultra- modern twist, but within the location context, works beautifully.During the first hour or so of 2011's new incarnation, I was shocked to think that I may end up liking this remake even more than the original. But after some hair-raising moments in the first half, culminating in a dark, desert car chase, the film threatens to go off the rails in a sequence that's a bit hokey, over the top, and unfortunately timed. And there are a few iffy CGI instances as well. Luckily, things get back on track with a climax that's executed with a uniquely creepy wit, and a few good shocks and surprises. Director Craig Gillespie (LARS AND THE REAL GIRL, ""United States of Tara"") earns respect for pulling off (for him) an unfamiliar genre; he also pays homage to a few memorable scenes in the original without trying to copy or disrespect them.Most of the performances are engaging and authentic (aside from Mintz-Plasse in his later moments), with Tennant's wry turn a real treat, and the ever-wonderful Collette's naturally grounding presence adding a needed weight of normalcy. It is Farrell, however, who is the real deal; he absolutely nails this role (no, he won't make you forget the original's suave Chris Sarandon, but in fairness, Jerry is written much differently in this update). Farrell combines sexiness and utter menace to the fullest: this vamp means business! Some of the best work of his admittedly spotty career is on display, including the film's most brilliant moment, where Jerry's fidgety impatience with being invited into the Brewster home is both hilarious and nerve-wracking.FRIGHT NIGHT is a solid film in its own right; if there's not enough love from the original's fans to spread out to its remake, that's unfortunate.",Fright Night
194,vantim-2,Better than expected remake,8,24 July 2011,"I was able to see this movie tonight at a preview screening at Disney Studios and I was pleasantly surprised. The actors all did a great job in their respective parts, I think Colin Farrell was a perfect choice to play the bad guy, and he is bad, He hardly even tries to hide it in the movie. I really enjoyed Imogen Poots, in the first movie I've noticed her, she played a wonderful range of emotions and gave our hero something worthwhile to fight for. However, for my money, David Tennant stole the show in a role that I wish was larger, but didn't need to be to serve the purpose of the film. He did a wonderful job not playing The Doctor so many of us have come to know and love him for, and yet he was just as enjoyable as a magician with a drinking problem. I would say the only weak spot in the cast was Christopher Mintz-Plasse, and it's not eve his fault. He just did such a unique job playing ""Mclovin'"" that even when his head is half off and he's trying to bite his friend, all I see is Mclovin'. I don't see this as an issue that Christopher can solve, but I am glad studios are giving him a chance to do so.They use of 3-D was also well done. This film has nothing on Transformers 3 in that area, but it still managed to use it, without over-using it.The script at times could have used as little toning, or maybe just some improv on the set to make it more realistic.All in all, I thoroughly enjoyed this movie and would recommend it to anyone that enjoyed Hot Fuzz, Shaun of The Dead, or Zombieland...Excellent balance of humor and horror which added up to a great popcorn film.8.5/10",Fright Night
195,codebreaker2001,"Okay, but it could have been better.",6,24 June 2012,"Now, I will admit, I grew up on the original ""Fright Night"" (1985) and it's sequel, ""Fright Night, Part 2"" (1988). So, I was a little hesitant to watch the remake in theater (be it the full price or even at the second run theater near where I live). So, I caught this on one of the movie channels and I will admit: It's okay, but not great.Judging as a film by itself, it was somewhat decent as a vampire movie, up until they resorted to using a fully CGed Jerry at the end of the film. However, the characters could have been better developed and the story made even more solid if the script had been fleshed out a bit more.But as a remake, across the board, it was somewhat of a let down. The characters are heavily modified and their development throughout the film fell flat. A good example is Peter Vincent. In the original film, he was just an actor who accidentally got dragged into the situation through Charlie and his friends, who eventually grew a spine and actually became the thing he portrayed within the movies-within-the-movie through his own will: a fearless vampire killer. In the remake, though we get a bit of back story behind Peter Vincent (who I thought was portrayed very well by David Tennant, given with what he had to work with) in the remake, he didn't grow a backbone like his 1985 counterpart and was mainly in an alcoholic fueled pursuit of revenge. Another thing that fell flat in comparison to the original was the friendship between Ed and Charley. You never get a real sense that they were ever really friends, even with the video footage of how ""things used to be.""There are a couple of perks in the remake that the original didn't have. For example, the threat to Charley's mom (which was only an idle threat through a phone call to Charley in the original) was brought up to the forefront, giving him even more reason to fight to protect the people he loves. The fact they brought Charley's mom into the fold of things (where as in the first film, she was not directly involved short of unknowingly inviting a vampire into her house and was ""away at work"" during the events of the original) helped back up Charley's reason to fight even more than in the original.Long story short, it's okay, but it could have been better if they had worked more on the script.",Fright Night
196,Weird_and_Proud1,A Fun and Retro teen flick.,7,2 January 2012,"The inevitability of comparisons with Hollands 1985 original juxtaposed with the current pandemic convulsion towards remakes put Fright Night at an immediate disadvantage. However a polished script coupled with a killer soundtrack and eccentric cast makes this a remake worth watching.Charley Brewster (Anton Yelchin) is a dweeb riding his luck having scored the high school babe after ditching his geeky childhood friend ""Evil"" Ed (Christopher Mintz-Plasse) – of course his face clearing up helped. His stereotypical teenage Idaho is threatened, however, when Ed insists his roughish (supposed lotharios) new neighbour (Colin Farrell) is in fact a night-working, blood-sucking vampire. This teen paradise is set asunder only after Ed goes missing and Charley goes snooping. Discovering sinister footage of a wheel-burrow pushing itself along, in the twilight, on his friends computer Charley surrenders to the absurd truth. His neighbour is a vampire.Here the action kicks off with a majestic start as Charley, hopelessly, seeks the help of famed Vegas illusionist and 'vampire slaying expert' Peter Vincent (David Tennant).This of course is before Jerry blows up his house, via a natural gas leak (he doesn't need an invitation if there's no house).Fright Night soars and this is largely owed to Director Craig Gillespie and Script-writer Marti Noxon's loyalty to the franchises 80's origins. Noxonsscript in particular expertly balances the dark humour, bloody plot, and teen angst trademark of such 80's classics as Heathers, and The Lost Boys. David Tennant and Colin Farrell give much needed gravitation to an otherwise weak young cast. Tennants elaborate costumes and appropriately camp performance further retains the nostalgic atmosphere around which the film is built. It is Farrells subtle performance as Charming, vicious vampire Jerry, however, that shines through the duration of the film. A stand-out moment being Jerry lingering on Charleys doorstop, nose twitching in anticipation as he cranes his neck inside, enticing Charley to invite him intothe kitchen.Fright Night is a cleverly crafted teen-movie and ironically a breath of fresh air after the exerting outpour of formulaic and underwhelming additions to the genre so far this year.",Fright Night

It was a typical high school freshman scary movie. I stopped watching it when the "" vampire "" ripped the gas line out of the ground to blow up the house. Whoever enjoyed this movie...and thought it was a scary one...needs to google "" top ten scary movies of all time. "" i wasted 2 hours of my life. My favorite part of this movie is when I threw it like a Frisbee and it sailed off to the unknown. It was just a horrible attempt to lure in kids who are obsessed with this vampire trend. I give it a three out of ten only because the mother was a milf. Enough said.",Fright Night

200,brunothepitt,"refreshing remake, good cast, eerie vibe... nice",8,1 August 2013,"vampire movies, zombie movies and horror movies are kinda popular in recent years. don't get me wrong when u need your fix its not hard to find something to tickle your fancy cause there are some decent ones out there. however at the same time many movies of this genre appear similar and predictable almost to the point where it seems the writer and producer has simply just wrote an average script with average ideas, added some monsters, looked for a scary set and added a creepy soundtrack. the original fright night was a horror movie from the 80's( i think) and was totally different to the other horrors we used to watch. our grandad used to make us watch the old black and white ones but this was modern and in colour..lol. the film was memorable because of the story, cast and it was eerie and spooky. very watchable so when i heard about the remake was curious and hoping they wouldn't mess this one up even though that would of been tough as the story so good. kudos they didn't.",Fright Night

It's so overused in culture today that I throw up a little every time I hear it and this movie had an abundance. Also, any remake that has Jerry f'n Dandridge uttering the line ""Do me a solid"" should come with a free round of shock treatment so I can forget what the hell I just heard. Hey, thanks also for turning Peter Vincent, made famous by Roddy McDowall, into a carbon copy of Russel Brand. Jesus Christ people are getting dumber by the minute in Hollywood.

203,maraven12,Absolutely Pathetic Remake,6,20 August 2011,"IT was a pathetic attempt to include scenes and pieces from the original fright night, but at the same time, incorporate a more unique storyline and character development. A 12 year old could have directed something with more flow. It jumps from the beginning with opening chars, then in 15 minutes, rushes to the actual idea that he is a vampire. Colin Farrell must have hated making this movie b/c he did not do nearly a good job as a vamp. Peter Vincent character is a retarded comic relief that makes no sense to the film at all. Its a half-breed retard who tries to be funny and then some. I never seen a more pathetic film that tried to throw everything into one movie. It is a retarded , piece-mewled film that was not worth a movie ticket and wont be worth the time to watch FREE on TV.",Fright Night
204,tormaen,Just realize...it's a remake. Not a replica.,7,19 August 2011,"OK, I am a HUGE fan of the original cult-classic. The parody of horror, while still taking it seriously was a breath-of-fresh-air. However, the remake is just that: a remake. I did the best i could to go into it with an open mind. It is modernized to relate to a new generation of watchers, yet unfortunately it retains practically none of the original. Vincent is not a TV star, he is a magician. I don't know why, but that was one of my biggest problems with it. it seems the two biggest similarities were the neighbor vampire and a chase scene through a club, similar to the original. Hell, evil eddie never even became a werewolf! Yet this movie is not dead. It has many hilarious points and has a few fresh new twists to present you with. It is not un-enjoyable, and in a new age of shitty, lovey-dovey vampires, this definitely is nice to see blood being drained in the most torturous of scenes.",Fright Night
205,forfrakssake,Where is the seduction???,3,8 February 2012,"In many ways it looks like a great re-make: they've managed to bring the story up to 2011 really well, and the actors are perfect for the roles. The renewal of the characters is also well done in most cases, I especially enjoyed the new ""Peter Vincent"" - they have found a very humorous way to renew this character. For the part of Jerry, Colin Farrel is a wise choice. But IMO they failed miserably in renewing this essential character. Unfortunately, and this is what ruins the whole movie for me; they have taken all the seduction out of Jerry!! :( What I LOVE about the old movie is especially the way Jerry seduces everyone around him (except Charlie). He even seduces Charlie's friend, Evil. And the scenes with Jerry and Amy are SO hot. That has all been taken out of the character Jerry in this movie, and that disappointed me so badly. If given the chance, I am certain that Colin Farrel would have rocked at playing Jerry in a more seductive way - he certainly has the look.So, because of this ""destruction"" of the character Jerry, I can only give the movie 3 stars.",Fright Night
206,ScoundrelSyndicate,Awesome movie. Completely satisfying remake!,10,23 August 2011,"Ignore the haters. This movie deserves all the positive reviews that it's earned. Solid writing, direction, and acting. Thoroughly satisfying and entertaining.As a die-hard fan of the original, my initial reaction upon hearing of the impending remake was disgust. Then, I found out Marti Noxon was writing the screenplay, and I started to hope. I hoped that it would be a respectful adaptation of the original, and join the ranks of Zack Snyder's Dawn of the Dead (2004) and 2003's Texas Chainsaw Massacre as one of the very few Remakes That Don't Suck...and it did. Not only did it not disappoint, it lived up to all my expectations.What made the original awesome is that it had charm. A vampire moves next door to you, and when he finds out that you found out what he is, he offers you a choice; you be cool & he'll be cool. I would've been cool, but the original Charlie wouldn't stand for a bloodsucker wasting beautiful women within view of his bedroom window, and a great movie ensued. Roddy MacDowall's Peter Vincent alone made it worthy of repeat viewings, and Chris Sarandon's underplaying made Jerry Dandridge THE most relatable fanged villain to date. The remake differs in many aspects, yet complements the 1985 classic. Whereas the original's vampire next door seeks to blend in suburbia, Colin Farrell's ""vampire Jerry"" couldn't care less who finds out what he is, because he plans on having everyone for dinner anyway. No brooding. No 'Twlilight' b.s. He's more of an apathetic predator than his predecessor, and it works for this adaptation. Since late-night local horror flick hosts are a long-lost remnant of the 80's, it wouldn't have made sense to try to fashion the updated Peter Vincent the same way. Like Roddy MacDowall's performance, David Tennant's Vegas illusionist Peter Vincent alone is worth the price of the tickets (AND the extra charge for 3D, which wasn't the least bit annoying, for once). As a bonus, it was especially amusing for me to watch Doctor Who drop f-bombs.Anyway, this film's as clever, charming, and all-around awesome as the original, and should be doing better at the box office than it did opening weekend. Check it out while there's still time & send a message to Hollywood that good writing, direction, and acting MATTER.",Fright Night
207,windtail,Great for what it is.,10,15 August 2011,"I had the privilege of seeing this film at the UK premiere last night, and i think the other 500 people that saw it with me will agree it was money well spent. The idea of a film that mixes comedy with horror has been done so many times before (the scary movie franchise, scream) but not quite like this. It wasn't stupid humour that got the laughs in the cinema (although there was some of it), it was clever one liners and funny characters. I think it was a good selection of actors that were chosen to be in this film - Colin Farrel was sufficiently creepy, Anton Yelchin took on the starring role brilliantly. And there was, of course, comedic characters - but somehow these still had depth. for instance, 'Evil' Ed, played by Chris Mintz-Plasse, although responsible for most of the hysterics and applause in the theatre, also had a dark, meaningful side that the audience can connect with. And then there's David Tennant, who portrays the drunk, messed-up Vegas performer perfectly. All in all, the message I got from the people around me, and what I certainly felt, is that the movie was very well received and I personally definitely enjoyed it. I'm deducting two points purely for the film itself - the acting, script and special effects were great, but no teenage vampire comedy is ever set out to make it into the wall of fame, is it?",Fright Night

209,maearth3,Why does Hollywood remake Horror Films?,8,15 December 2011,"Growing up in the 80's I experienced some of the greatest horror films ever made. When I heard that the 1985 version of ""Fright Night"" was being remade for a 2011 version, I was very skeptical about how true it would be to a classic horror film. The original ""Fright Night"" was a film that I didn't think could be recast or even retold. I was very surprised when I watched the 2011 version. I am a big fan of David Tennant and recently, after watching the new version, a big fan of Anton Yelchin. It's a remake that completely follows a different path. I really liked the new version and was surprised and delighted when Chris Sarandon was involved in the remake. Watching the new version was a horrific delight to see that Hollywood had taken a new direction to an old story and ""beefed it up"" (Colin Farrell)to make it hot and more CGI to the old horror films that I have watched and remembered. The one thing that I noticed about this remake that didn't seem to follow the path of a true horror film was that it didn't leave me hanging. With any good horror film the bad guy always wins and makes you ask ""What the hell?""",Fright Night
210,clockworktri,Disappointingly Sexist,4,13 July 2014,"I really, really wanted to like this film. I like horror films, I like comedy horror films, I like both Yelchin and Tennant. I was really looking forward to seeing this. I did think some of it was funny, and I enjoyed David Tennant quite a bit. But it's pretty hard to like something that is kind of insulting you. There is some pretty weird, unnecessary disrespect for women going on here. Two quick examples to give you an idea of how the movie views women: They felt the need to have the Mom explain (out of nowhere) that she was worth talking to because, direct quote, ""I'm your mom, not some ridiculous woman--"". ...yeah. Then, even when the girlfriend gets to kick butt for two seconds, she is immediately referred to as a bimbo, for no discernible reason (other than she is attractive? I think?).Since the sexism is not super overt, I think guys could probably enjoy this movie fine without really noticing it. So, congrats, because I really wanted to enjoy it too. But if you are a person with lady-bits who cares about being viewed as equal to people with man-bits, don't bother watching it. The fun/funny scenes are just not good enough to make up for the sexism. Sorry.",Fright Night
211,marilyncolgan,Good Vampire film,9,18 September 2012,"This was a very enjoyable film, but unfortunately for us we watched it on the t.v. and because it was filmed in 3D it didn't help us to watch it because a lot of it was in the dark. We loved both British actors in their parts. Colin Farrel who is Irish and David Tennent who was Doctor Who for a while. Would totally recommend the film to anybody who likes these kind of films. We knew it was a remake but we hadn't seen the original so we had nothing to compare it to. We have seen lots of other vampire films such as Salem Lot, The Lost Boys which I have just bought on DVD,all of the Twilight films and have the books too. This film compares favorably with all the other vampire films we have seen.",Fright Night

213,dvorkinax,This movie sucks,1,9 May 2014,"I cannot believe this movie got any positive reviews. I am a fan of the original and it's sequel , and other movies like ""My Best Friend is a Vampire."" I couldn't watch this trash scene for scene but the parts I caught were plain ridiculous, from the part where Jerry pulls the gas line in the yard and then blows their fireplace up to the idiotic car chase scene. Too many special effects that appear to be CGI(of course.) Don't even get me started on the stupid ending(once again crappy CGI.)There is zero sensuality and seduction in this remake. The dance scene in the original, at the club, with that sexy song playing in the background, as Dandrige pulls Amy near to him and Charlie is helpless as he watches. That wonderful scene of Dandrige and Amy on the floor when he releases the strap around her neck, as it falls down, he bites her, with ""Come to Me"" playing, the blood trickling down her neck. Come on now, I know many of you people out there have fantasized about those scenes. They were titillating. None of that in the remake. Are you kidding me? Did any of you leave this movie feeling thrilled?All the actors sucked. Wrongly casted movie. Could they have picked more boring and lifeless actors? Some movies do not need updating.Btw, I know people think the original Fright Night II wasn't as good but I liked it quite a bit. Those scary vampire roller skates and that scene where Dandrige's sister makes Charlie choose to bite his girl friend's neck and his eyes turn color. That was hot.",Fright Night
214,RealTyche,Absolutely horrible,1,12 September 2012,"This review contains spoilers. Do not read on if you wish to avoid them.As a long time, cheering fan of the original Fright Night, which I saw in 1985 with a girlfriend, I was hoping that this remake would capture at least the essence of the original and bring back memories of a better time. It failed on both counts.I found this movie pretentious, and obnoxious in an apparent attempt to disregard everything that the original feature had going for it except the character names. It struck me as a movie that looked at the source material and decided they could 'do it better', tossing out *everything* that made the original so memorable. Jerry Dandridge is supposed to be suave and debonair, always carrying a hint of malice. The new one is the sort of vampire that stands on the street corner and hisses, his motivations in this film make no sense whatsoever. Charley, whom in the original was a bit of a bumbling nerd with a heart of gold, is in the remake a clueless twit that isn't even the one to realize Dandridge is a vampire. And why on earth does Mom suddenly become an action heroine? The one concession to this movie I do make is David Tennant, whom has perfect comedic timing.Please don't bother with this one if you've seen and loved the original. it's not worth the time to watch it.",Fright Night
