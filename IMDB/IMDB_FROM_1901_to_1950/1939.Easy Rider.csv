0,MartinHafer,Worth seeing a second time...,10,13 July 2012,"I saw ""Easy Rider"" several decades ago and hated it. I had no idea what people saw in it. However, in the meantime, I have watched 457293811 films (give or take) and have changed a lot--as we all do over time. When I watched it again yesterday, I found so much to this film that I simply couldn't see the first time. Now I am NOT going to say that Dennis Hopper and Peter Fonda (who made and starred in the film) were geniuses here but they managed, with some amazing luck, to hit on something with this movie. In other words, their use of drugs managed to help them create the right movie for the right time. However, Hopper's next chance at directing (""The Last Movie"") was a complete mess--and listed as one of the films in the excellent book ""The 50 Worst Movies of All Time"" by Harry Medved)--because the drugs simply made his work incomprehensible.The film begins with two friends (Hopper and Fonda) making a big score--selling some cocaine to a crazy rich guy (very appropriately played by Phil Spector). Now with a fortune, they plan on taking their motorcycles across the American Southwest to New Orleans to party it up at the Mardi Gras.The film has little in the way of a strong plot--more just snapshots of their adventures along the way. Some of the vignettes seem to extol the virtues to the selfless and idealistic hippie movement (such as the group headed by Robert Walker, Jr.), some the importance of letting go and enjoying life (their bizarre meeting with Jack Nicholson) and many show the anger and hatred the 'squares' had towards these free spirits. However, what made this movie for me is that although it SEEMED to have a shallow plot and was often rather unprofessional looking, there was an amazing depth to the film that would make it excellent for repeated viewing. While the film would SEEM to make it look like it was idealizing drug dealing, it did not--as Fonda's character eventually realizes that all this money didn't give them the peace and happiness that some others had. It also was a great indictment of the state of America at the time--especially in the old South. All in all, well worth seeing.By the way, I grew up in a very conservative home during this time period. My father would often drive us into Georgetown (in DC) so we could watch the hippies and laugh at them....seriously. We would never yell at them or anything--just snicker at their clothes, hair and lifestyle. One time, however, our car broke down and these 'filthy hippies' all came and helped fix our car! It was, incidentally, the LAST time we ever went out to laugh at the hippies! Perhaps this, too, is why I found ""Easy Rider"" to be so interesting.",Easy Rider
1,TheLittleSongbird,"Slow start, when it picks up it's brilliant",9,23 January 2011,"Easy Rider is not quite a classic, but what it is is a great movie. It does start off slowly, but when it picks up the film has very few problems if any. The production values are excellent, the soundtrack is inspired, the script is very effective and Dennis Hopper's direction shows perfectly that he was as good a director as he was an actor. The story is also very compelling with a purposefully depressing ending(certainly a refreshing change from the somewhat clichéd riding into the sunset ending) and although the start is slow the pace is solid on the whole. The acting is faultless, the three leads Peter Fonda, Dennis Hopper and Jack Nicholson are superb and work wonderfully together.All in all, Easy Rider is a fine movie, while just missing out on masterpiece status. What's for sure though, it is one of the best road movies there is. 9/10 Bethany Cox",Easy Rider
2,Leofwine_draca,Dated,2,19 January 2013,"EASY RIDER is supposed to be one of those classic counter culture movies, but having just watched it I've only got one word for it: boring. The stars ad-libbed their lines and made it up as they went along, by all accounts, and boy does it show: the entire lack of a storyline makes this dated and difficult to sit through.Of course, if your idea of a good time is watching a couple of guys boozing and smoking weed for the entire running time, then be my guest. Honestly, I found both Fonda and Hopper to be irritating in the extreme, and I laughed at loud at the ridiculous climax of their story. I can't really see what the fuss is about Nicholson's appearance, either.Sure, there are things to enjoy, not least the soundtrack and the scenery, but those don't excuse the fact that EASY RIDER is a dated product of its time. Mumbling on about the American dream does not a good movie make; instead of profound, I found this pretentious.",Easy Rider
3,SnoopyStyle,great music and a counter-culture icon,8,7 February 2016,"Wyatt (Peter Fonda) and Billy (Dennis Hopper) smuggle drugs across the border from Mexico. After selling their haul in LA, the set off on their bikes for New Orleans and Mardi Gras. They aren't allowed to stay at a roadside motel. On the other hand, they are received warmly by a friendly farmer. They pick up an old hippie hitchhiker who invites them to stay at the commune. They join in a small town parade and are arrested. They befriend George Hanson (Jack Nicholson) spending time in the drunk tank who turns out to be an ACLU lawyer.Dennis Hopper directs a counter-culture icon to shake up Hollywood. It's mostly a meandering road trip. The flash edits are experimental and kind of annoying. Then there are moments of great dramatic tension like the guys walking into a small town diner. Those kinds of scenes elevate the movie and there is the great music. There is also an energy of immediate realism like when they walk around during Mardi Gras. This is a compelling watch and an important one.",Easy Rider
4,Hitchcoc,A Country Full of Anger,7,13 May 2015,"My friends and I went to see ""Easy Rider"" when we were in college. We sat around and commiserated about the fact that there was that Sword of Damocles, the Vietnam War, hanging over each of our heads. The anti-hero became the hero. Peter Fonda and Dennis Hopper travelling across the country, scoring drugs, taking risks, trying to find America (the cliché of the time). They have some dalliances and some confrontations. They hook up with some pathetic women. Hopper is a hothead. Fonda full of wanderlust. Jack Nicholson as George come along for the ride because he has never seen anything like this before. The problem was a sickness that permeated everything at the time. As I've grown older, it has been easier to see weaknesses of these men. We were so angry about the conclusion and our parents say these guys got just what they deserved. That's what America was at that time. This movie made us think of the fragility of our lives in the hands of politicians and base individuals. See this again after all these years.",Easy Rider
5,Horst_In_Translation,"Easy life, easy film",6,20 August 2019,"""Easy Rider"" is an American mostly English-language movie from 1969, so this one has its 50th anniversary now this year. It is a bit ironic that this film was shown here on the occasion of a Woodstock-themed film series on the big screen again just few days after the death of lead actor Peter Fonda. For him as well as his co-writer and co-actor Dennis Hopper (rip), this is certainly among the defining films of their careers. After all, both scored an Oscar nomination for the screenplay. And despite this being Hopper's first directorial effort, he was probably not too far away from an Oscar nomination there too with his DGA nod. The movie is not too long, runs for 95 minutes only and takes us into the life of two bikers who want to get to Mardi Gras. And we get to watch them on their journey and also meet all these people that they run into. The most memorable is probably played by Jack Nicholson, not only because he has the most screen time from the supporting cast, but also because it is Jack Nicholson. Enough said. This was sort of his breakthrough performance and the one that gave him his very first Oscar nomination. Many more were bound to follow. But as for this one here, it was all about him in the middle part really. Usually films these days have it that the supporting key players with hopes for awards recognition appear on several occasions (beginning, middle, end) with a solid amount of screen time, but then they are gone for a while again. Now that was different back then many times, Nicholson here is non-existent early on and towards the end, but he really shines in-between and it is absolutely accurate to say he was just too versatile and had/has too much range for the character given here. I am not surprised his was the only acting performance that got a lot of attention awards-wise. He was in his early 30s at that point. Still I must say I was a bit confused because I felt Peter Fonda really looked a lot like Nicholson in some shots early on, so i actually thought it was him before things cleared up then when the real Nicholson showed up in the prison scene. As for the other two: I felt Hopper was pretty interesting and likable and Fonda I found rather bland and boring, which surprised me a bit because I generally like introverted calm characters, but really, he felt just uninspired to me a lot of the time.Another thing I would like to mention is the change between scenes. Hopper took a pretty interesting approach here with these quick changes between old and new scene and location. It's entirely subjective how you perceive that. I personally did not like it too much. Now as for the key characters, it was actually pretty shocking to me how the film ended. I mean Nicholson's character's death was already a surprise and came out of nowhere, but the other two being randomly gunned down like animals was just really rough and unexpected. Also in terms of tone because it is a relatively light movie all in all about a bunch of guys just having some fun on their bikes, meeting girls they like and enjoying the wind in their hair. But you can also see the aggression aimed at them. Clearly bikers weren't the most beloved back then, at least not the way they are portrayed here. I mean girls love them, but really all the guys hate them. The fact that they are not let inside the hotel may still seem somewhat funny how it was shown, but when we see the sheriff and his buddy at the restaurant, later on also those who put them behind bars and eventually of course the guys firing at them, you can see that it was not an easy life for a biker. Kinda tough to stomach though how it was not the beautiful wild nature (there is one mesmerizing sky recording especially) that takes their lives at the end, but it's all hate that turns into violence and comes from other humans. And it is really almost always cold-blooded murder against a group of harmless dreamy folks who just want to ride down the highway, meet free-spirited people and girls, enjoy live music, smoke their joints and visit the nearest whorehouse. Speaking of joints, that scene was when Nicholson really shone, but it was also a bit sad because of how they say a joint always makes for a good start into a new day or something like that, but night ended brutal for him. Anyway, he made a lasting impression, even if admittedly I was confused by how he was the only one severely hurt in that attack and the way they depicted this attack, again with Hopper's unusual camera work and editing, could have been handled better. More touching maybe. I also did not like too much how, even if they were mourning initially, they quickly went on to daily business and continued their journey as if nothing happened basically. Oh yeah and the one thing I shall not forget is of course Steppenwolf's ""Born to be Wild"" from very early on. A classic song that will always be linked to this movie and probably also the other way around. Now that would be all. Overall, a good film I guess with some really surprising plot twists, especially at the end, but a true classic or really great film and contender for best of its year it is not in my opinion. Only something along the lines of a must-see if you are into biking yourself and/or want to travel down Route 66 at some point maybe. I am still glad I got to watch it on the big screen. I give it a thumbs-up of course. Go check it out.",Easy Rider
6,claudio_carvalho,Reflection of an Era,10,28 September 2008,"The partners and friends Wyatt (Peter Fonda) and Billy (Dennis Hopper) buy drugs in Mexico and deal in Los Angeles, raising money to travel to the Mardi Grass in New Orleans in their bikes. They cross their country disclosing a period of counterculture and intolerance through spectacular landscapes.""Easy Rider"" is certainly among my ten favorite movies ever. I do not know how many times I have watched this hypnotic cult movie in movie theaters, VHS, DVD and television, and I still love it. This film is certainly the first road-movie of cinema history and together with its stunning music score (among the bests of the cinema), partially portraits my youthfulness and my generation in a period of free love, drugs, relative freedom (I lived my adolescence in a period of military dictatorship in my country) and wonderful songs of some of the best bands of the planet, and also the never-ending intolerance of a conservative society that does not accept the changing and evolution of the next generation. The landscapes of North America are also magnificently shown through a wonderful cinematography. I do not know whether the younger generations can understand the deepness and the importance of this movie for older guys like me, a time-machine of a period that will never return. My vote is ten.Title (Brazil): ""Sem Destino"" (""Without Destiny"")",Easy Rider
7,kosmasp,You heard about it ...,8,12 August 2009,"... now go and watch it. Or better rent it, because it will be a rare occasion, if a cinema near you will play this movie. I had the chance to watch it on the ""big screen"" (well not that big, but in cinema screen which is still bigger than my Plasma TV). I didn't know what to expect, but this movie is a ""trip"" (pun very much intended) and could be one of the milestones in the road movie sub-genre (as many have declared it).The movie might have some odd choices (editing-wise, story-telling wise, character-wise), but despite all it's colorful and bleak messages it is a mesmerizing watch. Not to mention, great acting talents on view (one of the best Dennis Hopper roles, scene stealing Jack Nicholson and Mr. Fonda himself of course).A strange watch, that still works, if you're let yourself into it.",Easy Rider
8,classicsoncall,"""You know, this used to be a hell of a country.""",7,28 November 2020,"Technically, this is not a great movie, maybe not even a very good one. But it came at a time of cultural upheaval and political unrest in the country, with the rise of the hippie culture when the youth of America was questioning establishment values. 1969 saw the first moon landing, an upset win by the New York Mets in the World Series, and the spirit of Woodstock descending on a nation in turmoil. In the midst of all this, ""Easy Rider"" arrived with it's valiant attempt to underscore a conservative nation's attempt to grapple with the apprehension posed by the kind of personal freedom personified in the characters of Wyatt's Captain America (Peter Fonda) and his pot addled partner Billy (Dennis Hopper). The film was the embodiment of Kerouac's ""On The Road"", written a little over a decade earlier. So even if it's not a great film, it's probably an important one. One that puts into perspective what was going on at a time that helped shape the future of the country, some of it for good and some of it for bad. Watching the film today with my forty year old son, I had to field questions about whether things were really that skewed with rednecks belittling long hairs at a roadside diner because they looked different. Anyone old enough can attest to that kind of treatment of hippies, blacks, college students and anyone who didn't quite fit the mold of following in their parents' footsteps. I happened to see the picture when it first came out, and it had a lasting impact, especially the final scene in which Wyatt and Billy met their tragic end. And though I never traveled down the same path that they did, I've tried to keep that sentiment of personal freedom alive and well in my own life. Watch the movie with an open mind and search for it's message between the lines. You might come up with some surprising answers.",Easy Rider
9,gavin6942,Probably Not the Movie You Think It Is,7,31 August 2006,"I had heard of this movie, but had no idea what it was about. Even halfway through, I was a little confused. The first half is mostly Peter Fonda and Dennis Hopper riding their motorcycles with some nice scenery in the background and some classic rock blasting. Very little plot, besides a brief glimpse at a hippie commune and a family farm.The second half... well, that's a whole other story: I won't give it away, but let's say it involves Jack Nicholson, some drug use and a few prostitutes (cult actress Karen Black and ""Mickey"" singer Toni Basil). Let your mind think up situations and I assure you what really happens is even more bizarre.The film is all Peter Fonda and Dennis Hopper: they star, wrote and directed this film. I am not very familiar with Peter Fonda (though I love his daughter Bridget, who makes a small cameo in this film). He was excellent in this one. Dennis Hopper I know from such films as ""Blue Velvet"": he plays the cracked-out violent man very well. (If the rumors are true, he was cracked-out and violent on the set and treated the staff poorly, which does not surprise me in the least.) Hopper's violence was a bit disturbing at times, as I don't think it was the character's role to be so edgy. But I could be wrong.This is one of Jack Nicholson's earlier roles (allegedly his ""breakthrough"" role). And one of his funnier ones, as a drunkard and ACLU attorney. From his first moment on screen in the city jail, to the Jim Beam twitches... he really makes this film a joy to watch.Karen Black (who I know best from ""House of 1000 Corpses"") and Toni Basil (again, the singer of ""Mickey"" in the 1980s) were great prostitutes. Their parts made the film go from strange to completely surreal. You might have to watch their scene two or three times before you fully understand what is happening. I should also mention even Phil Spector makes an appearance in this movie, which is excellent given how looking back now he was very much a man of the time (see also Roger Ebert's ""Beyond the Valley of the Dolls"").The directing (by Hopper) is adequate, though the scene changes got a bit annoying with his ""flash"" technique. Credit should be given to the soundtrack people (perhaps Hopper again, I'm not sure), they picked out the perfect ""road music""... unfortunately the sound editor doesn't know how to fade in and out, so songs get chopped in really bad places for no reason.A special mention should be made of cinematographer László Kovács. According to his obituary in Time magazine, Kovacs is the man who really made this film a notable piece with his vivid scenery. I was not aware when I watched the film that this was one of the first attempts to move from an indoor stage movie to an outdoors film. I now understand the importance of all the background shots (which were beautiful, to say the least).If nothing else, watch this film because it's a classic or because it's one of the few films about hippies actually filmed in 1968. You might get discouraged after the first half hour, but I assure you the second half is worth the wait. And if you don't appreciate older films in general, well, this is not for you. But I think you're missing a whole world of film.My only regret? I wish I would have watched ""Starsky and Hutch"" after this rather than before... would have appreciated it better.",Easy Rider
10,lee_eisenberg,this is what rebel film-making is all about,10,26 October 2005,"Everyone remembers 1969 as the apex of the hippie culture, what with Woodstock, ""Easy Rider"", and such things. ""Easy Rider"" of course has motorcycle riders ""Captain America"" Wyatt (Peter Fonda) and Billy (Dennis Hopper, also the director) in search of America. Quite symbolic is the scene where Captain America throws away his watch; he doesn't care what time it is or anything like that, he just wants to get going. Then, of course, they meet George Hanson (Jack Nicholson) in New Orleans, and he opens up another world to them.I know that the movie probably made a lot more sense when people first saw it (I was born long after the '60s were over). But even so, it's a great look at that era, even if it seems a little dated nowadays.",Easy Rider
11,jboothmillard,Easy Rider,8,5 December 2005,"Many critics and cult fans call this the greatest road movie of all time, but I prefer things like Rain Man and Thelma & Louise which have more plot, but this is certainly not one to miss. Basically Wyatt (Peter Fonda, also writing) and Billy (Dennis Hopper, also writing and directing) are two hippie bikers loaded with plenty of crack cocaine (which they sell) and weed/grass. They are riding their motorcycles for both fun, and to hopefully get to the Mardi Gras (a Christian lent inspired festival with free love) in New Orleans. They are not able to get anywhere to sleep as the people they go up to are afraid of their difference, and the only company they really get is allowing a hitch-hiker (Luke Askew) to join them. They do however find other hippies to live out their fake dreams and have some fun with, but there is a point where they encounter the wrong people and get put in a jail cell. In the cell is also alcoholic lawyer George Hanson (Oscar, BAFTA and Golden Globe nominated Jack Nicholson) who gets them out and hitches a ride with them. George is very keen to reach what he hears is the best brothel, or whorehouse towards New Orleans, George is also introduced to marijuana, and is tagged with the boys' discrimination. In the middle of the night, George is killed as some hillbillies seen in a restaurant they ate in attack them, but Billy and Wyatt carry on towards New Orleans. They reach the whorehouse, meeting prostitutes Karen (Karen Black) and Mary (Toni Basil), and the reach the Mardi Gras parade and celebration, and also have a ""bad trip"" in a graveyard. The final scene of the film sees Billy and Wyatt riding on their bikes heading for Florida, and two hillbillies spot them in their pickup truck, and it is only when Billy gives them the middle finger they decide to kill them with their shotgun, and one of the bikes goes up in smoke. Hopper does very well acting and directing, Nicholson is fantastic in his boozy role that propelled him to stardom, and Fonda is okay too. With some great location filming going through mountains and desert, bike riding, very well done moments of editing, especially the ""bad trip"" scene and a good soundtrack, this is a really worthwhile classic cult movie. It was nominated the Oscar for Best Writing, Story and Screenplay Based on Material Not Previously Published or Produced. Dennis Hopper was number 80, and Jack Nicholson number 6 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars, Nicholson was number 63 on The 100 Greatest Sex Symbols, Hopper was number 49, and Nicholson number 7 on The World's Greatest Actor, ""Born To Be Wild"" was number 29 on 100 Years, 100 Songs, the film was number 88 on 100 Years, 100 Movies, and it was number 94 on The 100 Greatest Films. Very good!",Easy Rider
12,ccthemovieman-1,"Ah, To Be Young, Naive & Stupid Again!",5,6 January 2007,"This is one of those landmark films where I remember exactly when and where I saw this for the first time at the theater. I remember how pumped up I was before and after the film. Man, this was the greatest! I saw it several times and, of course, loved it. But that 35 years ago and I was young, rebellious, into the Hippie culture and all that other stuff.Re-visiting this film in the late '90s was a shock. I couldn't believe how stupid this film now looked; how naive it was! Hey, guys, lets's all live in a commune, live off the land and smoke dope all the day!!! That's the only true way to live. Puh-leeze. Give me a break. Or - you can do what our ""heroes"" do in the film. Sell some cocaine, take the money and get in your choppers and ride across the country. Oh....and get high all day, too! That's the only way to be totally free, man! Do you own thing, baby!! Can you imagine the whole country taking this advice?This was actually embarrassing to watch. Well, we are only young, stupid and Liberal once in a our lives. Hopefully, we grow up.I give it five stars only for the nostalgia.",Easy Rider
13,rmax304823,Rough Road Ahead.,8,24 February 2013,"This was a real ground breaker when it was released. I remember watching the tragic end in a New Jersey theater and seeing the audience leave, some with tears in their eyes.Sitting through it again, the first thing a viewer becomes aware of is how dated it is. There is Peter Fonda, young, thoughtful, soulful. There is Dennis Hopper, young, thoughtless, self indulgent. And Jack Nicholson with hair and a Southern accent, carrying on some phantasmic monologue about Venutians mating with humans. Fonda explains to Nicholson why smoking dope is better than getting drunk. ""How do you do it? Don't it lead to the hard stuff? I don't want to get hooked."" There are discussions about the meaning of ""freedom"" and a kaleidoscopic vision of an acid trip. Much of it seems so terribly earnest and yet we know by now that just about everyone involved in the production -- Dennis Hopper in particular -- was more or less stoned throughout.And, all of that dated material aside, the movie still packs a wallop. I found a few scenes a little slow. (That exalted commune with the naive youths scattering seeds in the dusty earth; you'd have to be a joiner to agree with Fonda that, ""They'll make it."") It's common knowledge now that Fonda, Hopper, and Nicholson don't make it to Florida. They're bumped off by rednecks, after being refused service in a café. It seems hard for us to go that far back in time and understand the symbolic significance of the Hippies' life style. What an awful thing a little bit of extra hair was. It's hard to believe. But I was refused service and insulted in a Texas café a few years earlier because one of the two guys I was traveling with had a neatly trimmed beard. When we asked why everyone else was being served, but not us, the waitress was explicit. ""We don't care for your type of trade around here anyhow."" And something similar happened later because the girl I was with wore a sweatshirt with the name of a Northern university on it.The year this was shot, 1968, represented the height of Flower Power. Like all social movement embracing freedom, it didn't last long. It turned violent. As Judge Learned Hand put it, ""A society in which men recognize no check on their freedom soon becomes a society where freedom is the possession of only a savage few."" But those were the 60s, the most anti-nomian decade in recent history. It's ironic that most of the cries for ""more freedom"" now come from those parts of social space in which the most constricted and rule-bound Americans are found. It seems at times that the freedom they demand is the freedom to compel everyone else to live the way they themselves do.In any case, let me get down off this soap box. My nose is beginning to bleed from the altitude. All that dated stuff aside, it's worth catching again. It's a farragonous chronicle of the times, okay, but it's sweet too. All that innocence, all that belief, all the beauty of that landscape of the earth and the mind, laid bare on the screen -- and in color.",Easy Rider
14,Tweekums,A requiem for the American dream,9,7 May 2017,"Having made a decent amount of money on a drug deal two Californian friends, Wyatt and Billy, take their motorbikes and set off from Los Angeles and head for New Orleans to attend Mardi Gras. Along the way they meet a group of hippies in a commune in the South West where they are struggling to grow crops in the arid soil, an alcoholic young lawyer in a town jail, threatening southern rednecks and a pair of prostitutes in a New Orleans bordello.This classic film is almost fifty years old now but still feels surprisingly fresh. There isn't really much in the way of a story; it is all about the journey and the contrasting people that our protagonists meet. Peter Fonda and Dennis Hopper do a fine job as Wyatt and Billy; characters who spend much of their time getting stoned. Jack Nicholson also impresses as lawyer George Hanson a man who in introduced to American counterculture when he meets Wyatt and Billy. The film certainly isn't bogged down with excessive dialogue; in deed quite a lot of the film is dialogue free as the protagonists ride through some spectacular scenery. This scenery, and some of the characters they meet, contrast with the bigotry and brutality of some of the people they encounter. This brutality isn't bloody or prolonged but it is shocking in its suddenness and the pointlessness of it. The soundtrack is also great and fits in perfectly with the story being told. There is of course a lot of drug use; which is almost certainly the main reason for its UK '18' certificate; without this it would probably be a '15' but it would also have been a very different film. Overall I'd certainly recommend this to any fans of classic films or those fascinated by '60s culture in America.",Easy Rider

16,moonspinner55,"Draggy drug culture ""epic""...",6,23 July 2006,"Whether or not Dennis Hopper intended to make an art film with ""Easy Rider"" is debatable, although his casual, almost smug nonchalance in handling this tale (along with a cinematic eye) did result in a box-office hit that still resonates today (but with dated trappings). Two hippies take a cross-country odyssey on their choppers, picking up an alcoholic lawyer on the way. Jack Nicholson received an Oscar nomination as the football helmet-wearing attorney, however his section of the film is possibly the weakest link. The cinematography by Laszlo Kovacs is vivid and incredible throughout, Hopper's direction is fashionably shaggy, but most of the performances are amateurish and the script (also Oscar-nominated!) is practically non-existent. Some startling moments in search of a plot. **1/2 from ****",Easy Rider
17,Quinoa1984,Best film of 1969; one of the best movies depicting the Hippie generation,10,1 September 2001,"Peter Fonda and Dennis Hopper star as one of best on-screen duos of all time- 2 bikers from L.A. (Los Angeles) make a good score and hide the money and pretty much everything they've ever dreamed of inside one of they're gas tanks on their way to Mardi Gras.  Along the way they pick up a hippie, 2 girls, a boozed and depressed lawyer (Jack Nicholson in his real breakthrough role which he really deserved) who finds things clearer after a little marijuana, 2 more girls (prostitutes in Mardi Gras), etc. 
Easy Rider is a cool, immensly entertaining and flowing motion picture that often has cruel and unusual power and also often contains very potent scenes of sweeping camera movements and trippy mountain views.  Hopper and company have created a real must see picture.  Great performances (Hopper and Nicholson are standouts and Fonda is almost as memorable) matched with awesome Laszlo Kovacs photography and a ending which will challenge the audience, make this a true American classic (ironic considering the tagline).  Note: if it may seem as if the characters are convincing in they're doped up ways in some potent campfire scenes, it was rumored the actors were actually smoking real dope for the scenes.  It worked.

Their cell mate,drunken ACLU lawyer George Hanson, does them a favor by getting them out of jail and then decides to join them. Babbling about Venusians, George discovers the joys of smoking grass, but an encounter with Southern rednecks soon proves how right he is about the danger posed by Billy's and Wyatt's unfettered life in a country that has lost its ideals. With the straight world closing in, Wyatt and Billy try to revel in New Orleans with some LSD and hookers but the acid trip is shot through with morbidity. Once they reach Florida, Billy raves about attaining the American dream; Wyatt, however, knows the truth: ""We blew it."" He knew that their financial success resulted in a spiritual failure.Easy Rider represents the feeling of its time about counterculture and the anti-establishment movement.It also reflects the emotions and spirit of its time.I must say that this movie represents what sex,drugs and rock and roll is all about. Great performances were turned in by Fonda,Hopper and Nicholson. Overall,the film is about the times of the Vietnam War era and the spirit of its times.",Easy Rider

20,Hey_Sweden,A man went looking for America and couldn't find it anywhere ...,10,1 November 2012,"""Easy Rider"" is a bona fide American classic, a film that transcends its genre and becomes something truly unique, a story of men, outsiders in society, who find the greatest freedom on the road and look for the real America while en route to New Orleans to enjoy Mardi Gras.Of course, in this case the story really is more about the journey than the destination, and it does possess an episodic nature as our two main characters, Wyatt a.k.a. ""Captain America"" (Peter Fonda) and Billy (Dennis Hopper) encounter many interesting individuals during their ride. The most memorable of them all will prove to be George Hanson, the boozy lawyer whom they befriend while in jail. This role is deliciously played by Jack Nicholson, and it's the performance that boosted him to stardom.Vivid contributions are made by all who appear, including the under-rated Luke Askew as the stranger on the highway, Toni Basil and Karen Black as a pair of N.O. prostitutes, Warren Finnerty as a solicitous rancher, and Luana Anders, Sabrina Scharf, Sandy Brown Wyeth and Robert Walker Jr. as assorted characters whom Wyatt and Billy meet while resting at a commune.At the time, Hopper was thinking of retiring from acting to focus on teaching, but Fonda, his real life friend with whom he co-wrote the script, offered to let him direct the film. Hopper called upon his pal Nicholson to introduce him to Bert Schneider, a partner in an independent production company affiliated with Columbia Pictures, and with that meeting, the funding became available. Rip Torn was originally supposed to play Hanson, but as fate would have it, he left the production before filming started, and Nicholson - who was just supposed to executive produce the thing - stepped in.The result is a haunting, mesmerizing experience, one with a particularly bleak ending, that enables the main characters and the viewers to take in various aspects of America - negative as well as positive. Its ultra cool rock soundtrack is a major plus - who doesn't get a thrill to see Fonda and Hopper riding their bikes to the strains of ""Born to be Wild""? Wonderful cinematography by Laszlo Kovacs likewise is a heavy asset. Some of those vistas are truly breathtaking, and the location work is excellent.This is one of those cinematic milestones that can continue to play to new generations as the years go by, while also functioning as an impressive snapshot of a specific era.10 out of 10.",Easy Rider
21,preppy-3,Way overpraised but still very good,8,18 February 2009,"Two hippies on motorcycles--Wyatt (Peter Fonda) and Billy (Dennis Hopper) are traveling from Los Angeles to New Orleans to attend the Mardi Gras. The movie just chronicles who they meet and the adventures they have along the way. Among the more notable ones are George Hanson (Jack Nicholson in the role that made him a star) as an alcoholic lawyer and Karen Black (!) and Toni Basil as hookers.This film was a HUGE box office hit when it came out. It was the first film that young kids in America saw that really depicted them as they were--and felt. It also almost destroyed Hollywood too when all the studios tried to copy it and came out with some of the worst most self-indulgent films ever made. Basically the older men running the studios couldn't make heads or tails out of this and just threw anything dealing with young people on the screen.This has been overpraised over the years. It is a VERY good film (I'm giving it 8 stars) with some incredible wide-screen photography and a great rock soundtrack...but it has a very depressing ending and doesn't really say anything. There are a lot of interesting insights in the conversations among Wyatt, Billy and George but these insights are pretty dated now. However, back in 1968, they may have been considered ""deep"". It is worth catching though from a historical standpoint and as the first film (and the best) to deal with the kids in the late 1960s and what they were going through. Very well directed by Hopper who never made another film as good as this again.",Easy Rider
22,LeonLouisRicci,ImportantInfluentialIncredibleInformative,10,6 April 2014,"Viewing this Seminal Film in the New Millennium one is Struck by how Authentic it is. If a Comparison is made to Any other Movie of its Time that tried to Capture the Counter-Culture it is Immediately Apparent that this is the Real Deal.From the Faces to the Far Out Dialog it is Cut from the Cloth of its Time. There is so much to Reflect on in this Time Capsule that Books have been Written about it and the Film has been Analyzed as much as Any of the Sixties. One of the Reason it gets so much Ink is that it was a Groundbreaking, Studio-Busting Movie that Ushered in a New Era of Independent Productions and Free-Form Cinema.It made God-Zillians on a Budget of around $400,000 and it was not on an Attraction of Novelty but on a Level of Contemplation and Exposition of its Time that was Changing and there was no Turning Back. Its Classic Western-Movie Template and the Freedom that Supposedly Defined America was at the Heart of this Heady Movie. it's Style was Fresh and its Attitude both Respectful and Irreverent. Wyatt (Peter Fonda) tells a Rancher that He should be Proud of His Humble Spread and His Unassuming Life. Then Jack Nicholson shows up and Pontificates about how being Free is talked about Relentlessly in America but if an American sees a Truly Free Person it is Scary and Perceived as Dangerous.Dennis Hopper Captured Lightning in a Bottle here with some Help from His Counter-Culture Friends Fonda, Terry Southern, and Bob Rafelson. The Cinematography is Outstanding and the Music Interludes Rock On and fit Smoothly onto the Paved Roads and the Wide Open Spaces. The Movie as a Whole is a Timeless Piece of Pop Culture and has Gained New Fans since its Initial Explosion and although some Today may find it Dated, be Assured and ask Anyone who was there, that is not the Case. It is a Captivating Reminder of just how it was at the Time.",Easy Rider
23,zardoz-13,Easy Chopper!!!,10,14 March 2013,"Watching Dennis Hopper's classic, counterculture, road trip ""Easy Rider"" (1969) co-starring Peter Fonda and Jack Nicholson, you may wonder what made this movie such a zeitgeist for its time. Of course, the America of 1969 was turbulent in ways that seem a far cry from contemporary America. The divisive Vietnam war dominated the headlines. Civil Rights activism had culminated with the assassination of Dr. Martin Luther King, and hippie movement with all its flower power had flourished. Reportedly, after Columbia Picture's chief executive Leo Jaffe saw ""Easy Rider,"" he observed, ""I don't know what the f*&k this picture means, but I know we're going to make a f*&k of a lot of money."" When you look at the film, the simple plot amounts to little more than a picaresque journey, with our protagonists on a cross-country trip from California to Florida. They pause along the way to meet a variety of people: a rancher, a commune, hostile Southern diners, and Florida duck hunters who have a blast. Essentially, ""Easy Rider"" is a fish-out-of-water fable, with Captain America (Peter Fonda of ""The Victors"") and Billy (Dennis Hopper of ""Rebel Without a Cause"") as the fish-out-of-water. At the time that it was made, Dennis Hopper was a noted character actor. Peter Fonda had starred in a few American International drive-in movies, most notably ""The Wild Angels,"" and Jack Nicholson of ""The Raven"" was earning his living as a character actor, too. ""Easy Rider"" made star of all three. Arguably, Nicholson went the farthest. Indeed, Nicholson is the heart of ""Easy Rider."" Simultaneously, Nicholson's small-time lawyer George Hanson inhabits both world: the establishment and the counterculture. Nicholson has the best lines, too. The meditation that he provides on the meaning of 'freedom' are point-on, brilliant. He explains to Billy that Wyatt and he represent a threat to Americans who had pigeon-holed by society's expectation. Sadly, when Nicholson exits ""Easy Rider,"" the film never recovers from his passing. Lenser László Kovács makes everything look spectacular, with our heroes tooling through gorgeous landscapes straight out of vintage westerns. The source music from Bob Dylan, Roger McGuinn, Jimi Hendrix, Steppenwolf, Fraternity of Man, The Electric Prunes, Smith, and The Byrds enhance the scenes, especially Steppenwolf's ""Born to Be Wild"" as our heroes hit the road. Although American International Pictures and other low-budget film companies had exploited ""The Wild One"" to produce scores of yarns about violent, murderous bikers, ""Easy Rider"" departs from that formula. Wyatt and Billy are unarmed and don't go searching for trouble. Interestingly, Hopper had filmed a chase with DEA helicopters in hot pursuit of Wyatt and Billy. Scenes like this would had imitated past motorcycle movies and detracted from the film's message. Hopper lensed ""Easy Rider"" as if it were a documentary, with real-life locals are supporting characters. Furthermore, he filmed everything on location, using natural light. The jail cell that Wyatt and Billy occupy with George Hanson is the actual deal. Peter Fonda was no stranger to motorcycles when he made ""Easy Rider"" with Dennis Hopper and Jack Nicholson. This seminal saga cost roughly $360-thousand and reaped $60-million at the box office. Basically, ""Easy Rider"" is all about intolerance and the Generation Gap in America during the 1960s. A couple of hippies sell cocaine to a wealthy gent (Phil Spector) and then set out for Mari Grais in New Orleans. Along the way, they pick up an alcoholic lawyer, George Hanson (Jack Nicholson of ""The Terror"") and rednecks ridicule them as they try to eat in a cafe. Although the older men deride our heroes, the young, impressionable girls in another booth idolize them. Later, these evil rednecks attack our heroes in the wild, and beat the lawyer to death. ""Easy Rider"" is a forerunner of ""Deliverance."" In ""Easy Rider,"" rednecks slaughter the angelic but stoned motorcyclists, while the rednecks rape the sportsmen in ""Deliverance."" Since Hollywood could not depict back rape back in the 1960s, particularly man-on-man--sadistic homosexuality, the rednecks simply beat them up. Captain America (Peter Fonda) and Billy encounter intolerance from traditional society and die as a consequence of being too different. This is liberal, gonzo film-making at its zenith and it exerted considerable effect on Hollywood and the industry at large. The word is that Fonda and company smoked real marijuana on the set which reflects the indie nature of this venture. Columbia Pictures didn't understand this counter-cultural masterpiece but they embraced its millions. ""Easy Rider"" couldn't have come at an more opportune time in Hollywood and social history. The imagery of the film influenced the cultural landscape and it appeared at a time of deep social unrest in the post-Civil Rights era. So if the marginal plot—call it existentialism—does nothing for you, the portrait of America and the intolerance displayed toward the hippies stands as an accurate barometer of the times. ""Easy Rider"" couldn't have been made much earlier because the Production Code Administration had only recently been dismantled in favor of a rating classification system. Fonda and Hopper don't so much deliver believable performances as they inhabit their costumes. Jack Nicholson is simply brilliant as the doomed lawyer George Hanson who understands the moral conscience of the terrain. He summarizes this when he tells Billy, ""What you represent to them is freedom."" The soundtrack features many tunes of the times that immortalize this picture. For the record, Billy dies from the first shotgun blast. Despite its laid-back pace and routine plot, ""Easy Rider"" ranks as a landmark picture and speaks volumes about bigotry in America.",Easy Rider
24,Boba_Fett1138,A reflection of its time.,8,9 June 2012,"Well, first of all, I can totally understand someone not liking this movie. In today's perspective, it might come across as a bit of a weird and pointless movie, that doesn't even necessarily follow a script. But you have to put this movie in perspective and really look at it as a product and reflection of its time.Back in 1969, this was an incredibly relevant movie. An entire generation of course grew up during this period, in which people were in constant search of themselves, true freedom and happiness. They wanted to break free from the system and live life to the max, by their own rules and morals. Yes, drugs were also a big part of this philosophy, as this movie also very clearly shows.Life was taken as a true journey, which is exactly what the two main characters out of this movie are doing. They are traveling from Los Angeles to New Orleans, in search. In search of what? Well, I don't necessarily believe they knew that themselves but in order to go in search of something, you don't always have to set a main goal. Sometimes you just don't know what you are searching- and in need for and just have to take things as they happen and look at everything with a free and open mind. I think this movie reflects all of those themes perfectly.And like I said before, the movie doesn't really follow a clear main plot line, just like life basically. Some people might have problems with this while watching but I in this particular case liked the approach, since it suited the movie its themes and atmosphere.And all of the drug use in this movie was obviously all too real, since otherwise there could have been no way that a movie like this could had been made, the way it is, in my opinion. It can get a pretty trippy movie at times, in which the main actors are obvious just improvising away. But again, also this truly adds to the movie its themes and overall atmosphere.It of course also was the movie that launched the careers of many involved, mainly of course Peter Fonda, Dennis Hopper and Jack Nicholson. And all do a great job with their roles, no matter how crazy and stoned they got at times, which probably is the secret though as to why their performances work out so well within this movie.A great minimalistic and on its surface also simplistic movie, that is being a great reflection of its time and of an entire generation.8/10 http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",Easy Rider
25,evanston_dad,The Myth of the American Dream,9,20 February 2007,"""Easy Rider"" likely made a generation of young men want to take to the road on motorbikes, sticking it to the man and living the American dream. And today, it's viewed nostalgically as a relic from a simpler, more innocent time. But I think it's wrong to read the film this way, and robs it of much of its impact. ""Easy Rider"" isn't about living the American dream; it's about finding out there is no such thing.That's what I like most about this movie. Dennis Hopper and Peter Fonda could have made a smug, alienating critique on bourgeois American culture, and it's rather surprising that they didn't. Instead, they made a disturbing film with a big heart at its center, about two drifters who go out in search of what makes America great, and find that there's no place in it for them. The ending packs a wallop, and I'm always amazed that two newbies who were probably both loopy most of the time on drugs could manage to put together such a strong, resonant film.Jack Nicholson appears in a supporting role as another drifter the two pick up on their travels, and the always fascinating Karen Black appears briefly as well as one of their female companions.Grade: A",Easy Rider
26,Uriah43,A Rare and Thought-Provoking Film,7,3 October 2016,"This movie essentially begins with two motorcyclists by the names of ""Billy"" (Dennis Hopper) and ""Captain America"" (Peter Fonda) journeying to Mexico to procure cocaine and then selling it for a hefty profit when they return to the United States. It's at this time that they decide to ride their motorcycles from Los Angeles to New Orleans in order to attend Mardi Gras. Along the way they meet a number of people with various philosophies and cultural norms. Some of the people are kind and generous while others are mean and intolerant. And one of the main factors behind the disconnect between these two groups is the acceptance and use of illegal drugs. At the same time this film also manages to combine some beautiful scenery on the way to New Orleans with an expression of freedom on the part of the individuals involved. On that note, however, it should be mentioned that this film is rather dated and presents a point-of-view which is admirable in one sense but also rather naive as well. Be that as it may, this is a rare and thought-provoking film with certain strengths and weaknesses which most viewers will probably find both interesting and entertaining. I have rated it accordingly. Above average.",Easy Rider

28,Wuchakk,Quest for freedom,9,17 January 2013,"If you can't handle the counter culture movement of the late 60s and early 70s and all that went with it (hippies, drugs, free sex and communes) I suggest staying away from ""Easy Rider."" For everyone else, this is an excellent period piece from 1969 that explores the nature of freedom and the quest thereof.Peter Fonda and Dennis Hopper star as Wyatt and Billy, two hippies who travel by choppers from Los Angeles to New Orleans to attend the Mardi Gras. Along the way they experience gorgeous landscapes, a commune, jail, new friends, unexpected enemies, drugs galore and a whore house when they arrive.Jack Nicholson stands out as one of the friends they meet; while the beautiful Karen black & Toni Basil star as two prostitutes in New Orleans.What makes ""Easy Rider"" great is that it's more than just a road adventure with a modern Western garnish (i.e. cowboys on motorized ""horses""). The film has depth that separates it from the typical biker flicks of that era. It's really about freedom or the lack thereof. Wyatt and Billy certainly have some grasp of freedom – and they desperately pursue it – but they're ironically so shackled by their OWN carnal desires and growing addictions that the most they attain is a piece of it. Wyatt laments near the end of the film: ""We blew it; we really blew it"" as he realizes freedom has slipped through their fingers like water. Nicholson's character, George, has more of handle on what's going on, but he obviously has his own issues.The hippies at the commune seem to have escaped society's shackles but to what end? There's a reason communes never really caught on in America, and the film shows why.In an interview with Rolling Stone in the early 70s Fonda pointed out that Wyatt represented everybody who feels that freedom can be bought, that you can find freedom through other things, like riding motorcycles across the country or smoking pot. He confessed that ""Easy Rider"" is actually about the LACK of freedom in modern Western Civilization. Wyatt and Billy are not right, they're wrong. The only thing the writers (Fonda & Hopper) could do in the end was kill the characters. In a sense, committing self-destruction, which Fonda claimed America was doing. He said viewers often respond to the end by lamenting, ""Look at those terrible rednecks, they killed those two free souls, blah, blah, blah."" But ""Easy Rider,"" he pointed out, is a Southern term for a whore's man, not a pimp, but the dude who lives with her. He's got the easy ride. And that's what he claims happened to America – liberty's become a whore, and we're all taking the easy ride.So what's the answer? The answer's there and it's pretty clear, but don't expect me to hand-feed it to you. Seek and you will find.In any event, this might give you some food for thought the next time you catch the film.Some modern viewers with ADHD criticize the film as boring, but I find it strangely engrossing from beginning to end. The climax is equal parts sudden, powerful, shocking and unforgettable.The film was shot in California, Arizona, New Mexico, Utah (Monument Valley) and Louisiana and runs 95 minutes.GRADE: A",Easy Rider
29,The_Void,The American Dream/Nightmare,8,25 August 2005,"Dennis Hopper's Easy Rider is often cited as being an all time classic, and while I don't think this is a great film in terms of technical brilliance, it sums up the era it was made and the tongue in cheek, cynical take on the 'American dream' is both potent and well done. This film is very much a product of the sixties and, like many things from the decade, will always be fondly remembered. Dennis Hopper and Peter Fonda, men of substance and substance abuse, wrote the film together and Hopper directed it. These two were obviously in the thick of what was cool in the sixties, and that gives the film an element of authenticity as we feel like what we're seeing isn't too far away from the things really going on at that time. The plot is simple and more just a base for the film to deliver it's real sting than anything else. It follows two motorbike riders on their way from Los Angeles to the Mardi Gras in New Orleans. We follow their exploits as they travel the country meeting various people including, most notably, George Hanson; an offbeat lawyer, played by the great Jack Nicholson.The American Dream has always been about freedom. But like George Hanson says; it's one thing to talk about being free, but something else entirely to actually be it. That's the theme of the entire movie, and the way that it plays out, and the ending especially, aptly portray the difference between saying something and actually doing it. The acting performances are a big part of the movie, and the two leads; Peter Fonda and Dennis Hopper stick out the most. The two actors brilliantly get into their characters, and after a while you forget that you're watching actors and start to think that these people really are these characters. Jack Nicholson turns up halfway through and steals the show. It's not hard to see why this actor went on to become one of the best of all time. Even here, he shows his charisma and ability to steal the show and that is what he would go on to become famous for doing later in his career. Last but not least, another great thing about Easy Rider is the music. Music was, of course, a big thing in the sixties; and it's a big thing about this movie. Classic rock accompanies the pictures of the two men rider their bikes, and it's very cool indeed. On the whole, this film is an out and out classic.",Easy Rider
30,Mr-Fusion,"Going on 50 years, this baby still roars on",8,28 January 2015,"(And I do mean spoilers) I know I've had the ending of ""Easy Rider"" ruined for me over the years, and the silver lining here is that I'd forgotten what happens when I finally sat down to watch this. Their deaths are tragic and really do punctuate the movie tremendously. But I was more saddened when Jack Nicholson was killed earlier on. The movie seemed to really come alive wen he showed up (and to some extent, dim after his exit), and his quirky and odd performance was an enjoyable addition.But regardless, the movie still stood on its own in Nicholson's absence. Back in '69, I imagine this was the cinematic totem for the '60s counterculture. It's gt ll of the marks: pot, rebellion, anti-establishment, even a commune. Today, it plays more like a time capsule, or at least it did for me. But either way, it's a great aimless road movie, and that is one hell of a soundtrack.8/10",Easy Rider
31,ShadeGrenade,in search of the 'real' America,10,1 November 2010,"In 1969, George Lazenby refused to play 'James Bond' in more than one movie because he felt 007 was finished, and that films like 'Easy Rider' represented the future of cinema. We can laugh now, but at that time it seemed a reasonable forecast. Audiences were tired of bloated, big budget extravaganzas and looked around for smaller, more intimate films about people. 'Easy Rider' came along at the right time. 'Biily' ( the late Dennis Hopper ) and 'Wyatt' ( Peter Fonda ) are two young men with motorbikes who, after purchasing 'grass', set off on an epic journey across the country, ostensibly heading for the New Orleans Mardi Gras. The film is primarily about their adventures. We find out little about them themselves - where they are from, what they did before, where their families are and so on - and do not really need to know. Billy looks like a cowboy ( with hat and drooping moustache ) while Wyatt thinks of himself as 'Captain America' ( and wears a flag on his back ). They take a strange hitch-hiker ( Luke Askew ) back to his commune, only for him to become unexpectedly hostile. They then gatecrash the carnival and are thrown into jail, where they meet George Hansen ( Jack Nicholson ), a drunken lawyer. In the film's funniest scene, around a campfire, George smokes grass while talking at length about aliens from outer space ( is this where Bryce Zabel got the idea for 'Dark Skies' from, one wonders? ).As was the case with Richard Rush's 'Psych-Out' ( 1968 ), the counter culture is depicted here as the norm. When Billy, Wyatt and George go into a restaurant, they are subjected to intolerant abuse from the locals, and quietly leave. But these red necks have not finished with them and beat them up as they sleep, killing George in the process. Taking his money, Billy and Wyatt enjoy a good meal and the company of two attractive hookers - Karen ( Karen Black ) and Mary ( Toni Basil ). The climax in which Billy and Wyatt are killed by a driver for no other reason that they have long hair shocks even now.Produced by Fonda and directed by Hopper, 'Easy Rider' was intended to be about a country in decline. Audiences responded differently; in New Orleans, they applauded the climax while elsewhere sympathy went to the murdered bikers.This could have been in lesser hands an aimless movie about people with nothing much to do but ride bikes but as partly written by the brilliant Terry Southern, it emerges as a sheer delight. The bitter tone of the film is complemented by its humour, mostly provided by Nicholson. You could see here that a superstar was waiting to happen.Mention 'Easy Rider' to most and the chances are the first thing they'll think of is the sight of Hopper and Fonda roaring along dusty roads to the sound of 'Born To Be Wild' by Steppenwolf. The other songs used work equally well. Magnificent photography from Laszlo Kovacs. It was a deserved hit then, and remains the best of its genre - the 'road' movie.",Easy Rider

33,StevePulaski,"Oops, wrong era",6,14 January 2012,"""Captain America"" (Fonda) and Billy (Hopper) are two freewheeling hippies, cruising the long, endless roads of America in hopes to make it to the New Orleans Mardi Gras party. The plot is so simple, yet so efficient. Many films with simple plots go far. Take for example my favorite film of all time, Clerks. It's a character driven film that is made possible because of the personalities of the people we are acquainted with. So this should've been an instant sign that this film was full of life and unexpected instances.So where does Easy Rider go wrong? It's not a horrible film, but it has some serious flaws that need to be addressed. Not growing up in the seventies, I think the relatable qualities have warn threadbare in modern times. My generation isn't all about peace, love, happiness, and relaxation, man. That is why I believe I didn't fully enjoy Easy Rider like I should've. I can see how this defined some people's lives, and perhaps gave society a better understanding on the hippie culture. Ultimately, over forty years later, the film just doesn't hold up.To begin with, the plot is very vacant. It's slim, slender, inconsistent, and hokey. If had not been for the music, I might have lost complete interest in the events unfolding on screen. The first couple of sequences where Captain America and Billy are riding on their choppers throughout the countryside with famed rock songs on in the background are unique and inventive. The style becomes monotonous when that becomes the central focus. Same thing goes with the lack of dialog. The film is vacant in the sense where there are very few scenes that humanize these characters. Most of the time, they are silent and empty, waiting to be expanded.Don't you hate when films do that? They introduce characters that seem like they can achieve greatness, but they choose to keep them flat and monotone? Easy Rider almost seems deliberately trying to keep these characters subtle and remote of any personalities.Still, the performances, when showcased, are fantastic. Peter Fonda and Dennis Hopper, who served as director and co-writer, are very well used and pack in unexpectedly impressive acting skills. Even Jack Nicholson is pitch-perfect, never striking a wrong note, as soon as he appears on the screen. Not to mention, the cinematography is enriching and glides the film along nicely.So to appreciate Easy Rider now, as part of a generation, you need to look at the things that previously went unnoticed or un-noted. The content is very minimal, like established before, the storyline is very slim and barely sustainable, and the character development is almost non-existent.Part of me believes the vague character development was on purpose. Maybe to give teenage rebels of the time a person they can perfectly put themselves into without complications. A caricature that can be made into a full character after you put yourself in the shoes of him. I wouldn't doubt that was one of the goals. From the different editing style in the beginning to the overall non-linear layout of the film, it seems Easy Rider dared to be different from the beginning.Alas, it doesn't work too well. It's deeper than other motorcycle movies I've seen of the same time period, but in 2012, it speaks to a generation that doesn't have ears to hear it anymore. My review is a compromise, leaning towards the positive side. I'm giving it two and a half stars. Maybe if I was a child of the fiftees and attended Easy Rider on opening weekend I would've given it more.Starring: Peter Fonda, Dennis Hopper, and Jack Nicholson. Directed by: Dennis Hopper.",Easy Rider
34,Smells_Like_Cheese,Born to be wild,6,3 October 2005,"Ah, the 60's. A time of peace, love, hippies, drugs, sex, freedom, etc. In my film class I took a couple years back, we watched a clip of this movie during our ""Decade of the 60's"" week.I learned that only a few good movies really came out of the 60's, like the Graduate and West Side Story. But it wasn't that big of a decade for films. ""Easy Rider"" was trashed at the time and considered a trailer trash type of film. This day, it's considered an art form and a classic to many. When I finally watched the whole movie, I couldn't really pay attention. The whole thing to me felt like an acid trip. I know it was the 60's, but man, this was out there.I'm not really sure if this is a classic to be remembered. All I know is that his movie is about getting high, getting drunk, Jack Nicholson, and riding motorcycles. :D So for the movie appreciators, this is for you. Otherwise, I don't think many would really enjoy this film.6/10",Easy Rider
35,blanbrn,The best counterculture film of our time. And the breakout and well deserved role for Jack Nicholson.,10,20 April 2007,"1969's ""Easy Rider"" continues to entertain generation after generation, and I can see why because it challenged authority during the rebellious 60's a tough time in U.S. culture. You have two Los Angeles(L.A.) outlaw and drug snorting, grass smoking hippie bikers who are played very well by Peter Fonda and Dennis Hopper who decide to venture across the west from L.A. to New Orleans in search of fun and a good time! Along the way the stretches of highway have many stops, but the best and most important part of the film are when they land in jail and encounter a young and intelligent southern lawyer(played to perfection by Nicholson and certainly his breakout role!) who decides to accompany them on the road journey of fun and freedom to New Orleans, I just love the quote that Nicholson's lawyer character says after leaving jail when telling the two bikers about a Louisana prostitution house it was ""These ain't no pork chops, these are U.S. prime! as the bikes roll on they encounter doom, and the Nichoslon character has a fatal ending, it's a shame because his young intelligent lawyer character was so likable, but was killed because he was different and had befriended two bikers and to me he had became the hero of this film. The fun and feel of freedom is found in New Orleans, only to have the establishment end it on the journey home.Overall ""Easy Rider"" is a film classic that took on the establishment of the 60's showing us a new hippie culture even though it is overblown with drugs these characters were just trying to show a new type and different kind of freedom. Also finally after many years of being in Roger Corman works and many B type horror movies, this finally turned out to be Jack Nicholson's breakout role that was much well deserved. Nicholson is perfect as an intelligent and likable southern lawyer George Hanson. And during the film the camera angles and montage scenes that flash are well done, plus the music played just makes the film move along so well with the background of the western U.S. this film is picture perfect. ""Easy Rider"" is certainly the best counterculture film of our time it was made to stand up against the 60's establishment and this movie did show a different kind of generation of freedom and new hippie culture showing that's it's OK to be different.",Easy Rider
36,MovieAddict2016,"An important film, a bit outdated but then again all films do grow old...",8,29 September 2004,"Two free spirits -- Peter Fonda and Dennis Hopper -- pick up a load of cocaine and decide to travel across America ""in search of the American dream."" Along the way they find the truth, along with misery and despair and other misfortunes.The movie is a big wandering mess. It's crude and the characters are poorly developed. Dialogue is weak. Performances are realistic because all the actors were stoned during production, and smoked real weed for the movie.THAT'S THE POINT!It has to be that way.That's why it's so irreverent, revolutional, evolutional...whatever.For anyone who loves ""cult movies"" or ""classics"" this is a must-see because essentially it's both. It combines the same central theme as ""Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas"" (Terry Gilliam's 1998 adaptation of Hunter S. Thompson's novel)I still like ""Fear and Loathing"" better because its main theme is stronger, its characters more believable and overall the inventiveness is excellent. Still, ""Easy Rider"" is definitely a classic and probably one of the greatest films ever made, if judged by a certain standard.Hopper shows talent behind the camera. But of course the best element is Jack Nicholson's brief performance and the soundtrack, including music by Steppenwolf (""The Pusher"" being used great in the opening credits).For cult fans, and film buffs.

38,ElMaruecan82,"From ""Born To Be Wild"" to ""We blew it, Billy""...",10,10 September 2012,"Peter Fonda, Dennis Hopper, Jack Nicholson in a free-wheeling cross-country journey to us, average people who keep on complaining how life is not easy, they are the easy riders.'Easy Rider' is a slang term used in the South to describe a prostitute's lover, someone who doesn't care for commitment but maybe for the rest of us, an ""easy rider"" is a free-spirited man, one who's his own model. It's all a matter of perceptions and the subversive odyssey of Wyatt and Billy invites each of us to question our idea of freedom and morality. ""Easy Rider"" is the most defining movie of the New Hollywood generation because the very philosophy of this new counterculture was to unveil the innate good behind the seemingly bad: young people with long hair, seeking an unreachable freedom through motorcycles or drugs, a hostile 'Peace and Love' counterculture with ugly and dirty people, all the more detestable because they were against the War. ""Easy Rider"" is the rallying cry of this misunderstood generation.""The idea of losing a War is detestable for every American"" said General Patton, well these guys already conceive the war as a moral defeat and they were no less Americans. Wyatt rides a Stars-and-Stripes-motorcycle and a similar helmet and his nickname says it all 'Captain America'. And his buddy wears a bushman hat and Native-American style clothes, that's Dennis Hopper as Billy. Both are men who went looking for America. And couldn't find it anywhere, that's the core of ""Easy Rider"" the film is less an existentialist quest than a nihilistic escape, the freedom of Wyatt and Billy carries a big deal of tragedy. They're free because they know they can't fight the system without corrupting themselves so they just drive for their own ideals, earning them people's hostility. The film carries very strong 'Western' undertones, a rediscovery of America's territory, with new values, as if it was indirectly stating that the conquest of the West failed, that America didn't achieve much, didn't respect its territory, and maybe the outlaws are the real people, Wyatt and Billy are references to Earp and the Kid, and the wheel changing is brilliantly paralleled with a horseshoeing. Wyatt later confesses to the farmer that he admires his lifestyle, the way he achieved self-sufficiency with a big family ""my wife is catholic"" says the farmer with a smile. He just provided an interesting example of an alternate lifestyle that rejected the city without denying all the values like Family and hard work. Wyatt respects that.The following episode involves a hippie hitchhiker who leads them to a commune. The hippie counterculture, pacifist in nature, implied a huge come-back to the roots of Human nature, to a sort of hedonism that quickly revealed the limit of their lifestyle: they escaped the city, but couldn't live without work and money, with just planting seeds on a desperately dry land and ask Divinity for rain, even Wyatt and Billy can't embrace this primitive philosophy, they maintain their cape to New Orleans. Life is made of many encounters and ""Easy Rider"" is full of them, but it's only when Jack Nicholson as the alcoholic ACLU lawyer George Hanson, makes his entrance that the film takes a spectacular takeoff and is elevated to its iconic status, because this time, we have the average man's perspective.Hanson is a pivotal character with his feet in the two worlds; he makes the most implacable diagnosis about the roots of America's ill being. Wyatt and Billy are pariah because they incarnate 'freedom': clothes, haircuts, smoking marijuana, drinking, it's a bunch of pleasures that are totally forbidden by 'American Way of Life', and what you're not strong enough to embrace; you'll be strong enough to fight. The rejection of all the traditional values reflects people's own frustrations, an anger they vented on the trio when they finally killed off Nicholson's character. Abrupt and anti-climactic, Hanson's death foreshadows the tragic path the film takes, these men have no chance to stand against society, but maybe the most exhilarating sensation of freedom is freedom to act even when the fight is lost. Easy Rider"" feels not just like a western, but like a modern revisionist western where at the end, it's the society that wins. ""Easy Rider"" is like the sad chronicle of an announced failure, foreshadowed by the enigmatic line delivered by Peter Fonda near the end ""We blew it  Billy"". They couldn't find this America they searched for, maybe because this America doesn't exist. Even the possibility of this long trip was allowed by money, money earned from drug smuggling, sold to the establishment (incarnated by the Rolls-Royce) and hid in an American-flag gas tank, through a long-phallic tube. As Fonda said, they were literally screwing America's values, and indirectly compromising themselves like any other loser. Those who fought the system with sincerity like the hippies were meant to lose, those who rejected the city but not some values like the farmer, could live in peace and dignity, and the others were too compromised to succeed, the genius of ""Easy Rider"" is to be more than a milestone of a generational counterculture, it was also its own epitaph, when the prostitute's lovers realized they were, in their way, prostituting themselves.And maybe the film invites us to the same self-criticism as we should ask ourselves a few questions before judging it : Why many of those who cheered and applauded at the film's screening end up as bankers or conservative businessmen? Didn't they blow it too, surrendering to the system?Why the film rings a bell even if we didn't live that era, have things changed that much? And if we don't like the film, isn't it because it indirectly mirrors our own lack of freedom and maybe we unconsciously wish to be, even for once, an easy rider",Easy Rider
39,MOscarbradley,And we're all off to look for America ...,9,26 August 2006,"Some of the material in this film has dated, (how could it not), and already this take on the counter-culture is a period piece, and yet it has it's own magnificence, (and considering it's virtual 'home-movie' status, this is doubly amazing). An almost unbearably youthful Dennis Hopper and Peter Fonda, (young, but past their teenage years; just the right age for their spaced-out odyssey), are the hippie bikers who use their drugs money to take a trip, (literally and metaphorically), from LA to New Orleans where Mardi Gras is taking place. (Mardi Gras, itself, becomes more than an event; it becomes a state of mind). Of course, what they are really doing is looking for the heart of America and never finding it. Maybe it doesn't exist, at least in any form other than a heart of darkness.On route they meet a boozed-up young lawyer, beautifully, quintessentially played by a young Jack Nicholson, (who only took over the part when Rip Torn bowed out), and the role made Nicholson a star. It's a small part but it has all the blissful, inconsequential easy charm Nicholson was to bring to his later roles, (sometimes he brought too much inconsequential, easy charm; as an actor he disarms too easily). But by the time he was making ""Easy Rider"" he had yet to make an impression on us, and he blew us away. And seldom has any film used the music of the period, aligned with a certain 'look', as well as Hopper does here. For people of a certain age, this really was the soundtrack to our lives.",Easy Rider
40,gbill-74877,A time capsule worth seeing,7,3 September 2019,"A film that is maybe perfect to the period, expressing 1960's counterculture and the desire to be free from conformity and 'normal' societal roles. This is the new face of America, Peter Fonda's star spangled Harley and jacket with its large flag emblazoned across the back say, but big portions of the country were not ready for it. In the 60's America was embroiled in bitter divisiveness over Vietnam, progressive political changes, and seemingly all aspects of culture, from music to recreational drug use to the length of one's hair. We see the two sides in conflict in this film, and the best scene is when Jack Nicholson's character explains to Fonda's why the rednecks and older people seem to hate the hippies so much. It's right after they've been in a diner where they're subjected to nonstop commentary about their looks from some other customers, when all they want to do is peacefully get a bite to eat. Peter Fonda is so cool in this moment and others, bringing a resigned weariness and wisdom to the way he looks at things. The dialogue goes like this:Nicholson: What you represent to them is freedom.
Fonda: What's wrong with freedom? That's what it's all about.
Nicholson: That's right. That's what it's all about. But talkin' about it and bein' it ... that's two different things. It's real hard to be free when you are bought and sold in the marketplace. 'Course, don't ever tell anybody that they're not free 'cause then they gonna get real busy killin' and maimin' to prove to you that they are. Oh, yeah, they gonna talk to you and talk to you and talk to you about individual freedom. But they see a free individual, it's gonna scare 'em.
Fonda: Well, it don't make 'em runnin' scared.
Nicholson: No. It makes 'em dangerous.I wish there had been a little more of this kind of thing in the film. Unfortunately it gets a bit uneven in scenes that may have been reflective of the times, but were less interesting to me today, like the one on the commune, later when they get high (ok this happens several times), when they visit the whorehouse (in what seems like pretty odd character motivation for reasons I won't spoil), and when they take acid in New Orleans. While the story-telling is uneven, maybe it's in keeping with the indie, hippie vibe to the film and the times, and I have to say, some of the shots director Dennis Hopper captures on the ride across America are fantastic. I also got a kick out of all the 60's slang (""I'm hip about time"", ""Go and get us a groovy dinner"", ""Dig, man"", etc), and that ending, my god, what a statement. For capturing the mood of the period I debated rating it a half tick higher, but regardless, it's like a time capsule worth seeing.",Easy Rider
41,cricketbat,Maybe you just had to be there (or be high),3,24 May 2021,"It seems that Easy Rider would appeal to a certain type of viewer. I am not that viewer. I couldn't relate to the drifting protagonists, the choppy editing was distracting, and it felt like they were just making up the simplistic story as they went. Also, while the soundtrack is great, it's obvious they were simply padding the runtime with extended music montages. Don't do drugs, kids, especially while making a movie.",Easy Rider
42,secondtake,"I hate to think of the Woodstock era as history, but here it is, unvarnished.",7,14 April 2010,"Easy Rider (1969)You can't take this movie at the same level as other Hollywood films, even from the same period. It's a low budget paean to the counterculture, and it plays itself out perfectly, with boredom and imperfection and without idealizing. This is huge. Here are a couple of bikers on the road, and things go wrong, and they meet up with some ordinary and less than savory folk, and they are less than admirable themselves.In other words, some reality here, and the movie was released 30 days before Woodstock, which is a kind of final rallying cry to the starry eyed (thank god) and a warning, in a way, that having too simple an idea of a new future is dangerous.Literally.Maybe the most telling moment in the film (and no accident that it's there) is the Mexican-American family toward the beginning, where they are living, successfully, on the land. They have traditional values (they pray, they have respect) and they are happy. Later, a commune of city kids, disillusioned young people who only want the best in the world, tries for the same thing, and they are clearly going to fail. It won't rain, they don't know what they are doing, they are acting only on ideas.So it is with our two bikers played by Peter Fonda and director Dennis Hopper (and for awhile, their tagalong lawyer in the form of Jack Nicholson). They are blindly hoping that they are in touch with a new order, a freedom that is so obvious and justified it can't be wrong. The drugs, the rednecks, the beatings, the disaster, are all naturally enough, too, but not in the idealism of their roadtrip. I think this is the 60s in a nutshell. It's not a great movie, but it's a great reflection on the times. And it's a very good movie, engrossing if you don't demand too much from it. Utterly significant.",Easy Rider
43,The-Sarkologist,This is one very scary movie,8,7 January 2012,"This is a very disturbing movie and one wonders if one is supposed to empathise with the main characters Wyatt (Peter Fonda) and Billy (Dennis Hopper). The tag line on the movie is about how two counter cultural riders travel from Los Angeles to New Orleans to discover America. I do not think that is true because it does not seem like they are out to discover America, but in traveling across the southern states they inevitably discover America, and what they discover is not pretty. To put it bluntly, the movie does not end pretty, and I do not think this movie paints a rosy picture of the American South (in fact, it seems quite scary and makes me think twice about traveling across country from Los Angeles to New York.Wyatt and Billy make a big drug deal and decide to travel by bike, Harley to be precise, to New Orleans for Mardi Gras. They probably should have flown, but that is beside the point. In their travels they meet a hippie commune, some Christian Indians, and a lot of rednecks. However these Californians are traveling across a very conservative part of the United States, and it is clear that they are not welcome. They have money, but it does not seem that their money will buy them acceptance. They are clearly different, and the conservative America does not like their difference.Jack Nicholson makes an appearance as a alcoholic civil libertarian lawyer, however he does not get results by fine sounding arguments, but rather by the sound of his money. He doesn't finish up well either. In fact, he does not even make it to New Orleans.Wyatt is a deep thinking, marijuana smoking, introvert, while Billy is a bit more outspoken. What is clear though is that they are not violent, nor are they looking for trouble. They just want to live the American dream (albeit by a big drug deal). The movie itself is very quiet, and I guess that is supposed to be the introspective aspect of it. We are meant to think about what the real America is about, and whether we are accepting of it. We probably aren't, but then again, those with a real conservative bent would probably not appreciate this film. It is quite critical and does cut to the bone.I want to finish off by mentioning the scene where they take some LSD. They have picked up a couple of whores from a whorehouse, and it is a very clean cut, upper class one at that. They then go to a graveyard and take the LSD. I must say that that scene was done really well, if fact it was one of the best drug scenes that I have ever seen. One actually wonders if Dennis Hopper made it from experience.",Easy Rider

47,johnnyboyz,Impressive road movie that looks at one's placement in the world when beliefs and goals are somewhat more obscure than other people's.,7,2 July 2009,"I suppose Easy Rider was the right film at the right time. Rather than make a brash statement on anything global or political, Easy Rider narrows things down and quietly observes what's going on within a nation and how a generation are acting and reacting to what's expected of them. The film is easy to relate to in both a generational and approach-like sense; that is to say, two people; on motorcycles; cruising the country and essentially discovering as much about themselves as they are the nation and the should-be manner in which to exist in this time and place.The film opens with its two chief protagonists named Wyatt (Fonda) and Billy (Hopper) meeting up with some shady men under the flight path of some low flying aircrafts. We eventually discover that they have just sold some drugs and, with the money earned from this, they are to travel across America to New Orleans. The opening feels like some sort of sordid silent movie, with distorted and deafening aircraft noises acting as harsh sound effects for a relatively simple scene while a series of expressions and reactions are revealed that get across the bulk of how these people feel and react to the situation. It feels cramped, loud and quite disorientating, particularly given it is the very opening of the film. Hopper then offers us some relief; a cut to a true opening shot of the deserts of somewhere as two bikes head down a road. Hopper juxtaposes shot choice and atmosphere brilliantly; it feels more upbeat as the new situation is they've inherited all this money, no longer have monkeys on their backs and are off on a road trip together. But this 'proper' opening is again turned on its head when we realise later on just what has transpired. It is a false and purposefully pleasant opening to a journey that will be anything but.You might say that one of maybe a few sub-themes in Easy Rider is dreams. Wyatt talks a lot early on about the American Dream and how he is perhaps slightly envious of the people living the typical American Dream, in the sense they might own a farm; be their own bosses and live off the land. Hopper's attention mise-en-scene is equally impressive. His alluding as to where the money earned by way of selling these drugs is situated for the duration of the trip is interesting, as are the clothes his two leads wear. Bathed in the American flag, Wyatt wears the symbol of the very nation he is both exploring and wants to subscribe to in terms of its ideation. Additionally, it is Wyatt's chopper that houses the, some might say, ill gained money and it is a petrol tank covered in a print of the American flag that houses the very contents which is allowing these two to seek and fund their fortunes.Along the way, the film will seductively begin to apply greater ideas to the overall notion of both the American Dream, the pros and cons of that ideation and the rather interesting study of individualism. The delivery is pretty clear cut in the sense Wyatt and Billy's interactions with a rancher and his family during a large dinner gathering offer one side of the ideation working whereas a, more larger, group of people are not able to subscribe to one of Wyatt's earlier fantasies of growing one's own crops and living freely, as these people cut off from the dominant social groups and beliefs. One might argue that this 'group' of whom cannot quite achieve this are of a more spiritual and religious kind, but rather than act as an entirely frank demonisation of any particular sects, we must remember they additionally subscribe to casual drug use and 'free love' which, depending on how you want to look at the text, might act as a distinct study of how not to live even though your initial priorities of not going with the norm are in place.Another interesting element to the text is Jack Nicholson's character of George Hanson, a voice of reason and a man who we might assume to have already subscribed to some kind of American Dream plan when we realise he is a lawyer. Nicholson portrays Hanson as an observant but slightly eccentric individual, someone who isn't afraid to voice opinions. It's interesting for the film to spend so much time with the two leads we're given and then introduce Hanson, who is more intelligent and who is someone that formally identifies Billy as an archetype of individualism and freedom through his hair, clothing and actions. On this level, you might assume Hanson to represent a sort of voice for the picture; as a person that comes just as easy as he goes and re-enforces the ideas of individualism just as efficiently as he points them out. A sort of 'I have no idea who you are but I sort of know what beliefs you subscribe to, and that's fine with me' way of thinking.Some might argue that the film needs to unfold in the deep south to get across the opinion, which one of the characters themselves exclaim, when it appears the nation is falling apart in order to demonise that region of the country. Others might say it is representative of the whole nation as a collective group of people forever shunning those on the outskirts, in minorities, doing their own thing. What might easily have been a series of daft scenes and occurrences compiled together to form a meandering at times road trip actually turns out to be an interesting and quite powerful odyssey for the-then free spirit.",Easy Rider

I'm not sure if the center piece for this movie was the plot or the beautiful Harley Davidson chopper Peter Fonda was riding on. I think the chopper affected more people than the story line itself. How many people have went out and either modified their bike or bought a chopper after seeing this movie ? As for the story itself, it's hard to find the point, except for three people traveling together on a motor bike. Maybe the point was all focused at the end where a red neck truck driver fires a shotgun at them for no good reason at all. I thought that scene was disjoint from all the other parts of the movie that just meandered over trivial topics. The last scene's message was that the society wasn't quite ready for the kind of freedom these bikers were looking for ( or maybe that Capt. America should have covered the gas tank of his bike with a small confederate flag while traveling the south ). I think the bike symbolized the '60s, the counter culture, and the freedom people were looking for at the time, as was the movie itself.",Easy Rider

The film still holds up well enough on the road, where the soundtrack and cinematography were used to good advantage, but shows its age whenever the two anti-heroes park their choppers and start talking, with Peter Fonda (as 'Captain America') nodding his head and saying things like, ""I can dig time"", and Dennis Hopper, playing the fool, doing his best to improvise while under a dope-induced fog (it's hard to imagine him sober enough to function as a director). The film's enormous popularity was in large part an accident of timing, arriving as it did at a moment when young audiences were ready and willing to tune in, turn on, and drop out.

54,FilmCriticLalitRao,Philosophy of life is one of this film's major highlights !!!!!!!!!!,10,19 April 2013,"In a narrow,traditional sense,Easy Rider has been acknowledged as one of the best bike movies.However,such a limited description would restrict the true appreciation of this film's recognition as a Long-Métrage which aptly deals with the philosophy of life.This is what film critic Mr.Lalit Rao felt when he watched this film.Freedom and freedom as an extremely dangerous idea are some of the major philosophical highlights of this film.These ideas are depicted in virtually all scenes wherein the film's protagonists cling to their freedom despite being fully aware of the fact that sticking to such a fundamental idea would threaten their very existences.This is the reason why Peter Fonda,Dennis Hopper and Terry Southern have advocated that acceptance of people regardless of their outward physical appearance should be the only true ethical responsibility of all sensible citizens.For film students,Easy Rider can be a true learning experience if they come to accept that the absence of a regular plot and sub plot in a film can help the director and screenwriter to defy the traditional beginning,middle and end approach in making a feature film.American cinema is usually associated with its insistence on easy to understand films for general public.This is the reason why there are not many American films which address philosophical issues.Lastly,apart from Terence Malick's *philosophical* films (Badlands, Days of Heaven, The Thin Red Line and The Tree of Life) if some other American film has dared to come closer to depict iconoclast ideas then it must be declared that ""Easy Rider"" is one such film.",Easy Rider
55,MaxBorg89,Still riding after all these years...,10,13 November 2005,"Easy Rider is and will always be a generation-defining movie: it made indie flicks cool, it gave birth, alongside Bonnie and Clyde and other classics, to the New Hollywood and it kick-started Jack Nicholson's career. The story is well known: two hippies, Billy(Dennis Hopper) and Wyatt(Peter Fonda), decide to go to New Orleans by motorbike in order to ""find"" America. Aside from smoking marijuana during the journey, they also meet some peculiar fellas, including convicted lawyer George Hanson(Nicholson), who decides to join them.Easy Rider is a brilliant coming-of-age movie, whose main theme is freedom, a particular kind of freedom, which won't be found until the end of the film. Through the characters' ""adventures"", it perfectly embodies the New Generation's point of view on America(the Vietnam War was still going on, the Kennedy brothers and Martin Luther King were dead). Modern viewers may not completely understand that, but whatever happens, this classic will still be a seminal '60s flick.",Easy Rider
56,Lechuguilla,Spaced - Out Bikers,9,12 December 2004,"In this counterculture film, we have a spaced-out trio of Peter Fonda, Dennis Hopper, and a funny Jack Nicholson tooling down the ""high""way, on motorcycles and ""stuff"", en route from L.A. to Mardi Gras. As artistic expression during an angry era of war and social change, the film communicates a powerful philosophy, in lieu of a complex plot.Most scenes take place outdoors, in the American South and Southwest. Laszlo Kovacs' adroit cinematography, combined with an expansive soundtrack, hippie lingo, and ""cool"" clothes, convey the film's underlying message of individual freedom and nonconformity. The film is significant in that it was one of several successful 60's films made by individuals outside the traditional Hollywood studio structure. As such, ""Easy Rider"" broke new ground in film-making.",Easy Rider
57,jimbo-53-186511,Art Imitating Life?,1,22 September 2015,"When watching a film I can sometimes ascertain how much I will like it within the first 5 or 10 minutes; I hated Easy Rider from the start and given its 'classic' status I hoped that it would improve as things progressed. Sadly, it remained bad from start to finish...Let's look at the plot for a minute; 2 hippies pull up at a petrol station, do some coke and move on, they then pick up a hitchhiker and stop at some random place and have some food and then move on again.Later in the film our 2 hippies pick up lawyer George Hanson (Jack Nicholson) who decides to tag along on their road trip to get to the Mardi Gras. At this point the boredom and pointlessness of the film had almost wore me out, but I persevered hoping that it would improve as it went along, but sadly it never did.The general narrative showed Hopper and Fonda in a drug-induced stupor and after watching this film I couldn't help but wonder if they were in the same state when they produced this mess. To me this just felt like a private joke between Fonda and Hopper that just didn't transfer well to audiences. The film seemed to veer from one pointless scene to another without offering any humour, insight or good dialogue. Most of the film was painful and boring to sit through and I struggled making it to the end (even though it was only 90 minutes long). What makes it worse is what follows later in the film; Nicholson's character gets beaten to death and although attempts are made later to 'make' something of it, it still strangely felt rather unceremonious. The scenes after this are just plain bizarre and Fonda's glib comment at the end explaining the pointlessness of everything that they had endured might have worked better if the whole film hadn't have felt so pointless - for me there was an unintended irony here.Despite reasonable performances from Hopper, Fonda, and Nicholson this to me felt like a really bad private joke between Fond and Hopper and the whole film was just an embarrassment from start to finish. The bizarre narrative, lack of insight into any of the characters and mind-numbingly boring story made this a rather challenging 90 minute viewing experience. It's cult status and its grandiose status amongst critics and IMDb members alike is something that is as much of a mystery to me as the film itself.",Easy Rider

59,slokes,Wake Me When The Revolution's Over...,3,23 July 2013,"When the music's playing, the iconography kind of works.The rest of the time, it's like root canal, except the dentist's the one on laughing gas.We join Billy (Dennis Hopper) and Captain America a. k. a. Wyatt (Peter Fonda) as they bike into the parking lot of a rundown Mexican cantina. The leather jacket with the American flag and the distinctive choppers are still to come, as these guys are still buying, not selling. After they do sell their suspicious white powdery substance to a menacing- looking L. A. slimeball, the now-well-off bikers head off into the horizon in their famous gear as Steppenwolf incongruously performs the anti-drug anthem ""The Pusher.""It's ten minutes before we hear either of the pair say a word in English, but it's sure worth the wait.""You're pulling inside,"" Billy observes to his zombie-like pal. ""You're getting a little distance, baby.""""Yeah, I'm getting my thing together,"" answers Captain A.Scintillating, no? Well, if you think so, then you're in luck, because these guys talk like that for the whole movie, which could have been titled ""Ninety Minutes In Search Of A Plot.""The movie gets a little better when Fonda wakes up and rejoins the movie. Hopper, however, is all over the place, acting like the character he later played in ""Apocalypse Now"" except he's not much fun. The dialogue, he tells us in a director's commentary, was often improvised by weed-smoking actors. It sure sounds that way.You can't argue that ""Easy Rider"" is an important movie. It has a great look-and-feel to it, courtesy of the rock score and László Kovács's psychedelic-but-disciplined lens work. The main problems are the characters' stubborn incoherence, the director's goofy French New Wave affectations, and the story's avoidance of anything resembling creative resolution. The guys just travel from place to place, socialize with people who are accepting and shake off those who aren't, until everything kind of just gets tossed on the roadside for us to work out.I like some bits in this movie, which can be divided into three parts of unequal length. The first, longest part, has the pair meet a stranger played by Luke Askew, the guy who made life so miserable for Cool Hand Luke two years before. Adjusting to that hard-jawed prison guard now dressed like a rainbow-trousered John Holmes is a trip, but Askew does a nice job, alternately confiding (to Captain America) and sharp (to the more hostile Billy).""The people this place belongs to are buried beneath you,"" he tells Billy between drags of his doobie. ""You could be a trifle polite.""In a great documentary that comes with the 30th Anniversary DVD and makes for much better viewing than the movie, Askew makes an interesting point about his character, that he's a bit of a leech that sets himself up as boss in a hippie commune in order to use the ladies. But none of this insight makes the finished film. The unnamed Askew character just stares out glassy-eyed for a while, warns the guys to be careful, and that's that.Later on, when the pair meet Jack Nicholson as alcoholic lawyer George Hanson, the film works harder at its core messaging. Like, freedom, man! And Venusians! Other than that, though, it doesn't have much to say, other than people who don't like hippies are a drag and dangerous besides. Nicholson is amusing, and it's fun seeing him settle into an early version of his wild-man persona, but it's still a long way to the Overlook Hotel, and the film loses him in a big scene that, like others in this movie, is not resolved but abandoned, for a final section set in Mardi Gras which includes a graveyard acid trip, glimpses of female nudity, and much mumbling.The whole film suffers from this slackness. As director, Hopper just wasn't into structure, and it shows. At least this viewer requires more. If you remember ""Easy Rider"" when it came out, you may have a soft spot for this film, but like Robin Williams might have put it, if you do remember ""Easy Rider"" when it came out you probably weren't really there.",Easy Rider
60,ferbs54,"""Far Out, Man!""",10,27 June 2018,"As of this writing, I have never had the good fortune to visit the city of New Orleans, although I sure do hope to do so one day. But unlike most people who visit the Big Easy, it is not the French Quarter that I most want to see, or even the Mardi Gras celebration. Rather (and I hope I'm not sounding too ghoulish here), it is the burial ground known as St. Louis Cemetery No. 1 that is tops on my list of places to see when I get there. ""But why,"" you may rightfully ask, ""would you want to go THERE, of all places?"" Well, it was at this famous burial ground, New Orleans' oldest, that one of this viewer's favorite scenes, in one of his Top 10 Favorite Films, was shot. The film was ""Easy Rider,"" and the cemetery was the location where the famous ""bad trip"" sequence was shot back in 1968...179 years after the cemetery's opening, in 1789. More on this in a moment.First, some personal background history: The summer of 1969 saw two cultural events transpire that were to have long-term seismic significance. We all know of the Woodstock festival that went down in August of that year, but the previous month gave birth to a cinematic event that was almost as far reaching in effect. That event was the premiere of ""Easy Rider"" on July 14. Now, when July 14 rolled around I was just 15 years old, living with my parents and sister (natch), had never attended a rock concert and had never taken a single puff of the ""devil weed."" As for those last two items, that would all change a week later in the case of the first, when I saw my first concert on July 21 (Led Zeppelin and B.B. King, if you're interested), and a month later in the case of the second, when I smoked my first joint in mid-August, while watching televised footage of the Woodstock event. But I did hang out with a bunch of guys who were heavily into rock music and were just beginning to dabble with drugs, and when ""Easy Rider"" opened in mid-July, I went with my best buds Dave, Jeff and Stephen to the Queens Theater (in Queens Village, Queens, NYC), to see this much-ballyhooed event. (Of my personal Top 10 Favorite Films, only ""You Only Live Twice"" and ""Easy Rider"" were seen by me theatrically when they first opened.) None of us, as I recall, did any smokeables that day (as I said, I was not into that stuff...yet), but for some reason, Stephen decided that he wanted to drop a hit of acid before watching the movie. Well do I recall how excited he was when he swallowed that teensy orange pill, and how he almost freaked out with glee as the Steppenwolf theme song for the film, ""Born To Be Wild,"" started to blare on the soundtrack. ""It's perfect,"" Stephen shouted over and over with joy. ""It's absolutely perfect!"" And indeed it was...an absolutely splendid choice of music to kick-start a film that has been a favorite of this viewer for almost half a century since its opening. The film just blew us all away that afternoon in 1969, and for good reason.""Easy Rider,"" as it turned out, was something of a surprise sensation that managed to shake up the establishment Hollywood film community. An independent venture, it was produced (by star Peter Fonda) at a cost of something like $400,000 and went on to bring in a whopping $60 million at the box office; an enormously profitable film, and one that virtually came out of nowhere, jump-starting dozens of other similar youth-oriented film projects. We all know the story line by now, I would imagine: How two bikers named Wyatt (Fonda) and Billy (played by Dennis Hopper, who also directed the film) cash in big after a cocaine-smuggling deal (their connection is played by no less a figure than Phil Spector) and decide to drop out, tour the country on their Harleys, and make it down to New Orleans for Mardi Gras. During the course of their journey, the two visit a poor Mexican family on their farm; have a pleasant sojourn at a hippie commune (where they go skinny-dipping with two communers, played by Luana Anders and Sabrina ""Miramanee"" Scharf); are arrested for ""parading without a license"" in a small town and are subsequently jailed; befriend alcoholic ACLU lawyer George Hanson (played by Jack Nicholson, in his breakthrough role, and in a part that had originally been meant for Rip Torn); visit a brothel in New Orleans; and take a very bad acid trip at that cemetery, along with two prostitutes, played by Toni Basil and Karen Black. Along the way, the two are witness to both the beauties of the U.S.A. (both its kindly people and its spectacular scenery) and its ugly side, as personified by the rednecks of the Deep South, with their intolerance and violent tendencies. Wyatt and Billy (a reference to Wyatt Earp and Billy the Kid, and a nod to the great Western films that Peter's father, Henry Fonda, helped to popularize) manage to have one helluva time as they make their way across the country...before their eventual downfall, that is.For a film that was largely improvised as it was shot, ""Easy Rider"" offers the viewer so very much to love today. Its script, written by Fonda & Hopper and Terry Southern (although it it likely that Southern was in the main responsible), although put together on the fly, remains a terrific one, with quotable line after quotable line for the ages. Its soundtrack, besides that Steppenwolf opener, is likewise aces, featuring such talents as Bob Dylan, Jimi Hendrix, The Byrds, The Band, and Roger McGuinn. The cinematography by Laszlo Kovacs is simply gorgeous to look at (America has rarely looked more travelogue lovely), and the picture gives the viewer scene after scene after scene that are guaranteed to stick in the memory. And oh, that ""bad trip"" sequence! It is a remarkable piece of filmmaking, a bona fide psychedelic freakout segment that turns out to be an infinitely more convincing cinematic depiction of the acid experience than the one given to audiences in the 1967 film ""The Trip"" (a film that had been written by Nicholson and that starred Peter Fonda and Dennis Hopper in their first teaming). Visually and aurally, it is an amazing experience that should go far in scaring any viewer away from ever trying the hallucinogen known as LSD. But one of this viewer's very favorite moments in ""Easy Rider"" comes early in the film, before the credits even roll. Wyatt and Billy have just made their big coke deal and have stashed their cash in the gas tank of Wyatt's chopper. Wyatt takes off his wristwatch, gives it one final look, and gently places it on the highway. He will never need it again; he has no more time pressures, no need to ever look at a clock again. He has all the time in the world...or so he thinks. The money he has just made will last him the rest of his life...and, ironically and tragically enough, so it does. I have always wondered if I myself will ever reach a moment in my life when I am able to remove my wristwatch and feel that I never need to look at it again. When I retire, perhaps? I somehow doubt it. But if I may add one more reason to love ""Easy Rider""--and it was probably the main reason that we all loved it so much back in 1969--it is the absolutely winning performance by Jack Nicholson here. Although he doesn't make his appearance until the film his halfway over, and disappears well before the film is done, he easily steals the picture, and he is the heart and soul of it. His campfire speech, the one in which he tells Wyatt and Billy, while smoking his first joint, that ""this used to be one hell of a country,"" is a wonderful one, and his words resonate even more today, almost 50 years later. Come to think of it, ""Easy Rider"" is a film that just might be ripe for a modern-day remake, as two free spirits take a ride through Trumpian America. It could be a very eye-opening experience, if done correctly, although I doubt that it will seem as fresh and exciting as this film was for so many of us back in 1969. Although perhaps a tad dated today, ""Easy Rider"" is a perfect time capsule of its era, and one that this old fan views with a great deal of nostalgic love and admiration. It really is ""far out, man!""",Easy Rider

From the hippie camp to the unwavering spite of the southerners, this film clarifies some of the struggles which existed within an extremely turbulent time in history. Sadly, this film was also a commentary about the dangers of conformity, resulting in the deaths of the motorcycle riders.

62,Jonny_Numb,On the Road...to boredom,3,4 January 2004,"The problem I had with ""Easy Rider"" was the same problem I had while reading Jack Kerouac's ""On the Road"" (of which it bears some similarity to): its status as a 'classic' only applies within the context of the generation it represented.  Now, some critics merely stop there and laud it as a classic, even in these modern times.  But in my mind, this is irrelevant because the generation (beatniks, bikers, hippies) is dead, has gone South, is splitsville.  Y'dig?  What we're left with is a few ideas that were innovative at the time (an acid trip shown through a fisheye lens), a lot of pretentious philosophy, stereotypical intolerant rednecks, and a storyline that meanders incessantly (that is, when it takes the time to show up). Perhaps I'm at a disadvantage, having not experienced the 1960s, but from the literature I've read of the era and the films I've seen, ""Easy Rider"" is a weak entry to laud as the representative of a generation.3/10",Easy Rider
63,truemythmedia,Authenticity Embodied,8,17 July 2019,"The thing that strikes me most as I watch ""Easy Rider"" is how simple of a concept it is. Just a couple of dudes riding cross country on motorcycles, getting high and meeting new people along the way. There aren't a ton of twist and turns, no big plot moments, and the characters, such as they are, are less characters and more alter egos of Hopper (""Blue Velvet"") and Fonda. In many ways the film feels more like a documentary than a film.That is why the film resonates with me. I watch it and feel that I am getting to know how these guys actually feel. When a character says how they are feeling It's not just the character that feels that way. It is the actor who felt that way. The intimacy that this creates is surely one of the draws of the film. These guys really feel this way. Their dialogue isn't the product of some Hollywood producer guessing what young people talk like these days.",Easy Rider
64,Spleen,"Let's drop the landmark-event-in-the-history-of-cinema excuse, and admit the truth: it stinks",2,7 April 2003,"A film can have historical significance and still be bad. It can be one of the most influential films ever made and still have no merit whatever. ""The Birth of a Nation"" proves the former claim. Now that I've seen ""Easy Rider"", I have proof of the latter.For this reason - the fact that I now have a crushing rejoinder to anyone who wants to exalt some mediocre work or other on the dubious grounds that it offered something new or founded a genre - I don't regret seeing ""Easy Rider"". My only regret is that I dozed off during the bit in which one of the actresses, or so I gather, bared her breasts. So there WAS something worth seeing buried in those 94 minutes. Just my luck to miss it.The only thing said in favour of this film, or at least said by people who are in favour of it, that I can't actually disprove, is that it perfectly captured the spirit of its time. (I'm tempted to say: ""Big deal."") Maybe it did. I wasn't born then. I notice that every other person reviewing this film begins, ""I hadn't been born in 1969, but..."" Go to the comments section of a genuinely great film, like ""Andrei Rublyev"", or a genuinely good one, like ""Take the Money and Run"", or even one that merely fails to be crashingly incompetent, like ""Topaz"", and see how many of THOSE comments begin with the author telling us whether or not he or she was alive in 1969. Still: not having been alive in 1969, I can't with complete confidence deny that ""Easy Rider"" summed up the feelings of a generation. But I doubt it. To think that would be to think that people in 1969 were doped to the gills ALL THE TIME; that they didn't have a coherent thought in their heads. The film sure as Hell doesn't have a coherent thought in ITS head. Danny Peary sums it up best when he remarks that when Captain America tells Billy: ""We blew it,"" it sounds like Peter Fonda, the producer, telling Dennis Hopper, the director, that they forgot to give their movie a point.If there IS a point, it's that any kind of social protest is the act of a degenerate madman. Is ""Easy Rider"" therefore the most virulently right wing, the most barking-mad conservative, film ever made? Possibly, but it undermines this status, even setting its utter clumsiness aside, with randomness, by (sigh ... spoiler follows) whacking off its protagonists at the end in an out-of-nowhere drive-by shooting, because it can't think what else to do with them.I missed the bit with the bare breasts, as I said, but I'm still pretty sure that the bulk of the film is set up to accompany the soundtrack album (which no doubt sold well). The pattern is as follows: We listen to some inane blather. Then the riders get on their motorcycles, and we watch the scenery go by as we listen to track one. Then they stop, and we listen to some more of their inane blather. Then they get back on their motorcycles and we watch some more scenery (cue track two). Then they stop and we listen to their inane blather again. Et cetera. I think there's even a pause in the middle as the record gets flipped over.",Easy Rider
65,framptonhollis,a man who went looking for America. and couldn't find it anywhere.,10,24 June 2017,"This famous 1960's cult movie made by some drug loving hippies at the height of their movement has somehow managed to stay baffling, entertaining, and surprisingly relevant in modern day America despite it containing various elements that are (quite obviously) outdated. ""Easy Rider"" is not only a historical artifact, it is an important and breathtaking work of cinema that is artistic, comic, tragic, and witty all at once.In recent years, ""Rider"" has faced its fair share of backlash from modern audiences and with good reason; despite my comments about its surprising relevancy, ""Easy Rider"" still very much is a product of its time...like, really, if this film were made today it could be considered some sort of subtle parody of the hippie movement because of how it is able to incorporate almost all of the hippie stereotypes into a 95 minute runtime and essentially verifying them. Many other complaints about the film deal with everything from it seemingly being pro-drug use to its bland characters, plot less approach, and overall loose, awkward structure and pacing. One could argue all of these points and be quite valid, but I have no choice but to disagree fiercely on all of these accounts (except maybe the pro drug one, but I'm the type of guy that has listed ""The Birth of a Nation"" among his favorite films of all time so evil intentions behind the screen do not remotely affect my opinion on a film a vast majority of the time). As a mater of fact, I believe that, despite its loose plot, this is one of the most well structured and paced films ever made. The way the episodic tale is told is brilliant in both its simplicity and overall engaging approach. Various characters are met and parted, fascinating discussions are had, amazing music is blasted, and tragedy almost always seems to strike. The characters are also pretty great, and, having rewatched this film a few times now, I find myself appreciating them more and more. Peter Fonda's character Wyatt works well as the lead, he is the sensible and sensitive partner of Dennis Hopper's unforgettably quirky and somewhat crazy (of course I use this term with lightheartedness) character Billy, and Jack Nicholson's George Hanson has become something of a legend. His performance is not only hilarious but essential in terms of the film's stability among the greatest of all time. Without Nicholson's character and performance, the movie would still be excellent but much less memorable, iconic, and...good! The weird, wonderful, and wacky George Hanson is the reason that this movie has received a 10/10 overall rating from me rather than a 9, he adds a whole new layer of comedy to the film, which helps increase the entertainment value as well as the weight of later, more tragic sequences (such as the *sniffle* ending) . He also spews much of the movie's finest lines, from the funniest quotes ( ""Neh! Neh! Neh! Fuh! Fuh! Fuh! Indians.""; at least, that's how the Quotes page on IMDb spells it!) to the most deep (I hate that word, but it applies here, no question about it) and brilliant ones (""I mean, it's real hard to be free when you are bought and sold in the marketplace. Of course, don't ever tell anybody that they're not free, 'cause then they're gonna get real busy killin' and maimin' to prove to you that they are. Oh, yeah, they're gonna talk to you, and talk to you, and talk to you about individual freedom. But they see a free individual, it's gonna scare 'em.""). Of course, this film is FULL of amazing dialogue from everyone involved. The diner sequence is made both funny and intense due to the witticisms and insults thrown around, any sequence taking place around a fire at night is bound to have something quotable (everything from quotes like ""I'm from the city... Doesn't matter what city; all cities are alike."" to others such as ""You're stoned out of your mind, man."" (which is a line that pretty much applies to everyone involved in making this movie, not at all excluding those behind the camera)), and so on and so on. Even the various words that fly around and intersect throughout the famously trippy LSD sequence create something of a bizarre poetry. The LSD scene within itself is among the greatest and most surreal American movie moments of all time. I don't know whether it makes me want to do or avoid drugs, but what I do know is that it makes them seem like an...interesting experience. The camera angle and music and off screen dialogue create a collage of imagery and words that is disturbing, weird, and flat out AMAZING all at once. If that one segment were a standalone short film, I would probably give it the highest rating possible, it's just that good. Of course, practically EVERY scene in this movie is good! From the opening credits to the ending credits, everything is made unique and watchable all thanks to the incredible amount of effort and talent used by all of those involved. This radical and rebellious road trip across 1969 America is one of those films a movie buff cannot afford to miss, even if they'd probably hate it, it is something of essential viewing (not only is it a part of U.S. counterculture history, but it is also one of the films responsible for the great American New Wave movement that would continue throughout the seventies and early eighties). Personally, I find this movie to be absolutely astonishing and near perfect on every single level possible. It provokes thought, laughter, tears, and feeling, it is, simply, a miraculous masterpiece and, despite its outdated elements, it is ultimately one of those movies that, for me at least, never gets old.",Easy Rider
66,breakdownthatfilm-blogspot-com,Not so much engaging for its plot or story but is educational in some respects,7,22 June 2015,"As much as actor Peter Fonda and Dennis Hopper have been veterans of Hollywood and performed in countless films, for many, this is probably the film they are most associated with all the time. During the 1960s, the United States was going through a very different kind of revolution. This revolution was not just one thing, but a multitude of areas that spanned various racial backgrounds and cultures. The Civil Rights movement was a largely significant event going on during the decade. However another significant movement that also went on during this time was the ""counter-culture"". This movement was about the generation after the 1950s and below that was tired of the traditional ""American Dream"" and took matters into their own hands. This led to the idea of them ""trying to find themselves"". This consisted of things people didn't normally do during the time as freely - free roam traveling, drugs, adultery, etc.This is more or less the same idea here but portrayed in a positive light. Dennis Hopper and Peter Fonda play Billy and Wyatt respectively as two free flowing traveling bikers out to catch the upcoming Mardigras in Louisiana. On their journey they come across other encounters that show them other types of viewpoints of the time. For the screenplay co- written by Fonda, Hopper and Terry Southern (writer of Barbarella (1968)), it really is quite thin in plot but as minimal a story that it serves, it does have a great depiction of the culture at the time and how other people viewed it too. There's an array of different social statuses that are covered. That means from the rural farmland, suburb communities and even hippie towns. There, viewers will get the experience of seeing the kinds of opinions that existed out in the US when riders like these would show up.Just because you live easy and travel around doing sight seeing doesn't always make you look harmless. There are people who don't mind and there are people who do mind. These kinds of views are elaborated on even further by another character named George Hanson by a young Jack Nicholson. Perhaps the only written part that isn't fleshed out is Jack Nicholson's background. Hanson comes on screen after Wyatt and Billy are jailed for parading without a license and Hanson helps them get out. So how did Hanson do that? If he had the power to have Wyatt, Billy and himself released, why was he there in the first place? Obviously for plot's sake but it does feel a bit contrived if only for that reason. Nevertheless the three main actors are adequate for the roles they are cast for and their dialog although quite bereft of intelligence is understandable either way.Yes, a lot of their dialog is reduced to including the word ""man"" in every sentence, but again it was apart of the culture at the time so it at least fits. Also, even though Dennis Hopper and Peter Fonda are the main leads, Jack Nicholson's performance is more lively and entertaining than theirs with his unhinged personality. However this does not mean Hopper and Fonda aren't good. The best part about their performance is that they are not portrayed as mean spirited jerks like the wretched The Wild Angels (1966) Peter Fonda starred in prior. No, they don't follow all the rules everyday citizens do but they are at least polite to the people they meet. On a technical basis of filmmaking there is only one component that doesn't exactly work quite right and that's the editing by Donn Cambern. Occasionally the transition between scenes will flicker with the upcoming shot a couple times before it finally sticking with it. Not sure what that was all about but it was distracting.The rest however is nothing short of bad. Surprisingly for its time there is no film score to this movie. Instead, whenever Wyatt and Billy are on the road fans of the older music will hear a bunch of their favorite songs. The best and most recognizable would be ""Born to Be Wild"" by Steppenwolf. ""Don't Bogart Me"" by Fraternity of Man and ""I Wasn't Born to Follow"" by The Byrds are all catchy, encapsulate and ooze the 60s era with their cry-freedom lyrics and rocking guitars. The one thing audiences will be blown away most by will be László Kovács cinematography. For a film involving a story with much road riding, you'd hope there would be plenty of landscape shots and that's exactly what you'll get. There are so many great shots of the western rocky desert. It is breathtaking even when you're not physically there. It's too bad Kovács passed away, he really had a good eye.It has some editing issues, one unexplained character back story and its plot is fairly simplistic, yet understanding the era it was made from kind of makes sense why (somewhat). It has decent acting by its main cast, the cinematography is great, and its music and accurate depiction of the culture back then makes it feel like an adequate history lesson.",Easy Rider
67,eric262003,Defining Ending of A Wild Era,9,9 January 2012,"""Easy Rider"" truly defines what the late 1960's was all about. It was a time where people truly revolutionized what the pursuit of freedom was all about. It was all about revving your Harley's, smoking that cannabis or that other cool adult candy that was being served freely. It was a time of civil unity amongst every American citizen, the era of protest against the Vietnam War something that all the baby boomers have either witnessed or experienced. Peter Fonda's saying of ""everything goes"" was proved effectively and it's all exhibited in a nice little package that will surely influence scholars who are curious of events and lifestyles that truly symbolized what the 1960's was all about. The DVD behind the scenes was very insightful and provocative. Fonda and the late Dennis Hopper graciously fills us in on the trials and tribulations of how they succeed in keeping it raw and real in demonstrating what events transpired in the late sixties focusing primarily in the southern states where discrimination was at its worse, segregation was becoming obsolete so the South took their hostile hatred towards the hippie generation, or any other punk who had long hair. The legendary cinematography Lazlo Kovac once again waves his superficial magic wand and lets the scenery do all the magic in creating a hostile environment towards these two biker mavericks as the take a cross-country road-trip from Los Angeles to New Orleans on their Harley Davidson's to find the real meaning of Americana. The highways scenes were truly authentic especially when they drive through New Mexico. The scene you don't want to bat an eyelash comes near the very ending where the camera pans out to give a chilling sensation that could either be a scene from the Vietnam War. Or a superficial sigh of hope of a new era that won their freedom. Sure in all its glory one cannot leave out the soundtrack that truly symbolized what the 1960's was all about and the talents behind these immortal artists of their generation. I mean when you hear Steppenwolf's ""Born to be Wild"" you better get that air guitar out and start playing. Other great iconic musicians include The Byrds, Bob Dylan and Jimi Hendrix will also rock your wold with and hour and thirty-five minutes of rock solid oldies that will make you feel like you're in Woodstock again. You wouldn't want to miss this iconic film for all the marijuana in San Francisco.",Easy Rider
68,bandw,There is a reason this continues to be viewed and discussed,8,16 September 2011,"Some may summarize this as simply the story of two drug-addled hippies taking a motorcycle trip from Los Angeles to New Orleans and leave it at that. But most viewers find that there is more here.I liked this as much for what it doesn't say as for what it does, leaving me to think about it. For example, the first scene has our two heroes Wyatt and Billy closing a lucrative cocaine sale with a dealer who arrives in a Rolls Royce. Is this a singular event for them, or are they dealers of long standing? I am tempted to believe the latter, since it is hard to believe they have such high level contacts otherwise. Where did they come by the quantity they were dealing with? And how did these two characters come to be what they are at the beginning of this movie? That is never even hinted at, allowing us to fill in the back-story. What was their motivation for the trip? They are not about to tell us, since they don't have much to say. We have to try to understand these guys from their actions, from what is shown of what they see along the way, and from the few interactions they have. If there is any emotional depth, it resides in Wyatt who projects a certain contemplative humanism. I couldn't get much more of a handle on Billy beyond drugs, sex, and good times. How did these two get tangled up with each other?As the two bike through deserted highways in southern Arizona and New Mexico a sense of freedom of the road and the beauty of the landscapes is well presented. We get a little more insight into a basic theme of freedom when Wyatt and Billy meet small town lawyer George Hanson. The idea of getting on a bike and just taking off is so appealing for George that he joins the trip. Fortunately George is a bit more articulate than either Wyatt or Billy and he is given some good dialog. He notes that Americans are always talking about freedom, but when they see a truly free individual, it scares them and makes them dangerous--a prophetic remark, given what is about to happen to George as well as, later, to Wyatt and Billy . George also opines, ""You know, this used to be a helluva good country. I can't understand what's gone wrong with it."" Since this movie came out after the Kennedy assassinations and during the middle of the Vietnam War, George's comment resonated with a lot of viewers.Wyatt makes one of the most ambiguous comments after the Mardi Gras scene and he was back on the road, ""We blew it."" By ""we"" was Wyatt simply referring to him and Billy? There is evidence for that view. The acid trip in New Orleans looked to me like a real downer. Maybe Wyatt was expressing regret about the drug deal and how he had funded the trip at the expense of an element of society that was not compatible with his philosophy? He had made the comment that it was hard to be free in a society where one's worth was determined in the marketplace. Since ""easy rider"" is slang for a person indirectly living off of prostitution, perhaps the drug deal made Wyatt an easy rider in that since, rather than the ease with which he rode his bike. Also, Wyatt was surely not without guilt about the death of George and how easily they just left him behind.By ""we"" did Wyatt mean the counterculture movement? If that movement was to bring peace and love, those were not much in evidence in what they encountered as they entered the deep south. Even the visit to the commune was a depressing affair. It was abundantly clear that that was not going to make it by depending on its own resources. One of the saddest scenes was seeing commune members tossing seeds onto the dusty soil with the desire to ""grow simple food for simple people."" Even Billy recognized the inevitable ill outcome of this when he asked, ""You guys ever get any rain?""By ""we"" did Wyatt mean the United States? The fact that his nickname was ""Captain America"" and he wore a leather jacket with a large American flag on it would argue for this. It's hard to know what Wyatt was expecting from his trip, but his experiences would imply that he did not find it. He met discrimination, saw poverty, and wound up with a bust of an experience in New Orleans. Given their appearance and and their mode of transportation the guys would have to have been pretty naive not to realize that they would not be welcomed with open arms in the rural south.Playing Wyatt was not much more demanding of Peter Fonda than he just look serious and say a few lines. Dennis Hopper had no trouble playing the stoned hippie to the point where you figured he was just being himself. But he had to be more than that in order to have directed this effort using some creative techniques and supporting it with a great rock soundtrack. It is Jack Nicholson who turns in the star performance as George. He creates a sympathetic character that is hard not to like. I could understand his wanting to burst out of his unhappy existence by getting a taste of freedom.In the end I came to see this as a condemnation of the small-minded thinking that fears what is different and can react only with a desire to destroy it. A great amount of the suffering in the history of mankind has been the result of just that thinking.",Easy Rider

70,sme_no_densetsu,"""We blew it""",8,11 June 2011,"""Easy Rider"" is a counter-cultural classic that today stands as one of the defining movies of the 60's. The story is a simple one: Fresh off a lucrative drug deal, a pair of bikers travel from L.A. to New Orleans trying to make it in time for Mardi Gras. Along the way, they experience then-contemporary America in its many forms.The film is essentially a 'road movie', so the plot is more or less secondary. Yet, while there are several sequences of the two protagonists travelling to the classic sounds of Steppenwolf, the Band & others, the backbone of the story is an Oscar-nominated script that provides thoughtful commentary on post-Summer of Love America.The acting is pretty good, too; especially considering that this was a low-budget affair that utilized a number of non-actors. Stars Peter Fonda & Dennis Hopper showed obvious authenticity while Jack Nicholson shone in his breakout (not to mention Oscar-nominated) performance. In general, the cast was well-assembled and populated with some distinctive individuals.Dennis Hopper's direction is solid and some of his artistic flourishes show the influence of European stylists. That being said, some of his techniques might come across as a bit excessive (at least they did to me). Musically, the film is exceptional in its selection of contemporary rock tunes. There are several classics featured and even the relative obscurities are memorable.Perhaps, if you're the sort of person who can't abide dated material, ""Easy Rider"" may not be for you. Personally, I see it as a fascinating time capsule showing both the optimism of the peace & love movement along with the disillusionment left in its wake.",Easy Rider

72,pyrocitor,Freedom and the 'American Dream',9,28 November 2007,"The image of Peter Fonda and Dennis Hopper riding gaudy chopper motorcycles past vast, picturesque American plains is one frequently seen and nostalgically cherished in contemporary pop culture - such is the crux of Easy Rider. But despite the film's standing as one of the most iconic films of the decade, and debatably of all time, it has also proved itself to have become one of the most misrepresented in the public eye. Far from being a simple narcotic fraught motorcycle road trip movie as it is most often known as, the story's premise is merely a springboard to the film's deeper and more resonant themes and social commentary. The film managed to capture the 'essence' and spirit of the sixties in a fashion which struck a chord with countless audiences at the time, and still carries an intoxicating message of counterculture for those willing to take it in. Upon viewing in a contemporary context, it is small wonder why the film spoke so directly to the youth of its time - the countercultural central message of two men cast out from society simply because of their looks and lifestyles is poignant, addressing teenaged alienation and existentialism in a way perfectly befitting the rebellious decade. However, Hopper's film transcends the notion of merely pandering to an impressionable teen audience, and instead uses the film's context as a carefully paced palate for critiquing larger standards of American living. The film's subversive take on the 'American dream' both relishes and critiques the central characters' search for freedom (begging the question to the end as to whether they finally find it, and how exactly freedom is defined) as well as presenting a disturbingly poignant portrayal of the American melting pot gone sour, and the prejudice often greeting ""the other"". The audience is forced to ask themselves whether it is the essentially harmless long haired bikers, admittably different from what was deemed 'normal' but fairly conservatively so, or the 'normal' people jeering and casting them out who are the real 'threat' to an everyday way of life. Is it really so threatening to be different, Hopper and Fonda silently cry out - and it is a cry which leaves the viewer ruminating long after the closing credits. The central three characters all give subtly superb performances, perfectly essaying the sparse dialogue, and creating tremendously endearing and believable characters (although it is highly doubtful the 'stoned' scenes were acted bereft of any external substance aids...). The fact that we as an audience know next to nothing about the past of either main character is a clever touch, making them all the more allegorical or relatable for a widespread audience. Peter Fonda gives a career defining performance as stoic, quiet biker Wyatt. Ironically dubbed 'Captain America', Wyatt seems to be constantly attempting to find a niche in society or reach some form of social truth - always unsuccessfully. His LSD induced cemetery breakdown scene is tremendously moving to watch, and his final line is a source of infinite contention, resonating profoundly long after the fact. Dennis Hopper is similarly impressive as fellow biker Billy, who seems to have fully embraced and immersed himself in a countercultural lifestyle, always finding friction with those who do not instantly see eye to eye with him, whether a hippy commune, or a town of southern bigots. Billy is more than happy to simply go along for the ride, rather than searching for any profound truths like Wyatt. And in the role that brought him to public notice, the legendary Jack Nicholson gives one of his strongest performances as boozing lawyer George Hanson, the only character in the film who can see the country as it really is, and understand both sides of the culture clash - comprehending the freedom of a life lived without limits, yet making his living as a lawyer who boozes at nights. Strikingly funny and infinitely charismatic, yet with an underlying dramatic depth, Nicholson proves an uncanny ability to steal scenes without his later showy grandstanding. Viewers taking in the film will most likely either connect with its emotional core or not; there is no way around it. Safe to say those devoid of a more profound emotional connection will still have much to enjoy in the gorgeous natural landscapes and social commentary on the decade, each scene meticulously placed as essential to the film as a whole. But those who do connect with the film will have so much more of a profound experience: the joyful sharing of unbound freedom on the road, the slashing political ruminations and cultural significance, the groundbreaking technical work and infamous rock soundtrack - but mostly a highly enjoyable, simplistic but profound journey of discovery and reflection - one which should be enjoyed by anyone willing to commit to giving the film more thought than a simple drug addled road movie. -9/10",Easy Rider
73,jromanbaker,Futility,10,17 January 2020,"I do not love this film; I am not even sure if I liked watching this film. I was living in Paris when it came out and I avoided it. It was so far from everything that was happening in France. 1968 had ostensibly failed, leaving traces of bitterness in the air that the revolution could not happen. And in the film the so-called hippie movement showed that in essence man does not want his individuality and that when you attempt to break away from conformism you just live in a bubble until it bursts. Like another reviewer I also perceived that their ' journey ' is fuelled by corrupt capitalist money. They are temporarily free because they deal in drugs, and despite all the grand speeches about freedom they are chained to those who will destroy them and their liberty. It is ultimately futile and tragic, and yet after all these years since I avoided seeing it I realised it is a great film. The wilderness that they ride in is similar to the films of Anthony Mann, of John Sturges and I kind of expected Jack Palance to appear, resurrected from the magnificent film ' Shane '. It is the reverse side of the coin of the Western, and what you get in the end is the cruelty meted out in so many of those conservative films and by this I mean all those Indian massacre scenarios too long a list to name. And massacre happens here. The innocent rivers flow by, but the killers know nothing of innocence and those who die are tainted by bad money. It is never too late to see this film and it is painful, sad and at the same time beautiful to watch. I do not like either Dennis Hopper or Jack Nicolson but I put this to the back of my mind as I sat, watching an ' old ' young film pondering on all the meanings of that elusive and possibly always unattainable freedom.",Easy Rider
74,film-critic,This used to be a helluva good country. I can't understand what's gone wrong with it.,8,25 September 2004,"I was utterly surprised by this film. I was expecting nothing more than some short scenes of our now-infamous actors smoking marijuana followed by trippy Willy Wonka scenes . Oddly, this did occur, but this film was much more than that. This film should be shown in every American History class in the United States. It not only showed the beauty of the country of which we reside, but it also spoke about the people that reside in it. You know the old saying, 'Guns don't kill people, people kill people', well after watching this film, it is a very true statement. We are afraid of what is different. We are a culture that is afraid of change, yet seek it so badly. We are a society of hypocrites, androids, and ignorants. We thrive on the fact that we are the best country in the world, yet somebody shows any disassociation of routine, we are the first to question and get angry. I would dare say that we have moved so far from the 60s that I cannot see why our parents do not cry everyday. Their generations was a free-spirited, mind challenging culture that explored all possibilities no matter the cost. The experience was all they needed as a reward. Now, we are more concerned about money and the family-plan that we sometimes place ourselves on the backburner to life. Wake, eat, and pay the bills. What a sad daily structure that we have. When was the last time you considered the possibility of just jumping on your bike and riding until you hit water? Probably not for a long time  why? It is called 'bills' and 'responsibilities'. These are the choices that we chose to make, and for anyone to say that they cannot do it, I would have to challenge. You CAN do anything, it is whether you chose to do it is another question. I wonder what it will be like in another 30 years. Where will we be, and will the idea of individualism be lost? I can't wait to see Outside of the deeply rooted themes of this film, I felt that Hopper (who also directed) knew exactly what he was doing behind the camera. He kept the talking short, the music loud and symbolic, and allowed the background to do the explaining. I loved the fact that we really knew nothing about Fonda or Hopper's characters. It allowed us to relate to them. You could easily add your story into their characters and have the life that you lead and wish to escape. Hopper was able to transform this film from a drug movie to a film about humanity. Fonda, who also helped write the film with Hopper, did a superb job of adding Nicholson's character into the mix.Nicholson represented us, the American public and our love of liquor, football, and lies. I viewed Nicholson as the average American. He drank too much, was the product of a wealthy upbringing, but did not know much about the world. He was sheltered. He never smoked weed (in fact didn't even know what it was when presented to him), never left the state line, and never lived life. He constantly used the expression, 'I have always wanted to '. How many times do you hear this a day from either a family member or a co-worker? If you always wanted to do it, why haven't you? So, here we have Hanson, dreaming a dream but never following through, who is traveling with two guys that live the ultimate life and live by their own rules. They are complete opposites, but Hanson's words seemed to remain in my mind for a long time. He reminded me of one of my wife's students today that spoke about freedom. He knew exactly what it was, but never practiced it. Hopper and Fonda were walking (driving most of the time) representations of the word 'freedom'. It is tragic what happens to Harmon, because he (unfortunately) experienced the negative side of freedom  hatred and fear of the unknown.There was one scene that just jumped out at me. It occurs in the diner before the incident later that night where our travelers experience hatred in the country they admire so much. They go from peace and love to fear and hate. It is as if they witnessed night and day. It was frightening to hear the words coming from people in that restaurant. It was not only scary to wonder what was going to happen to our narrators, but mainly that people were speaking that way to fellow citizens. I know that it still occurs today, and it is surprising to me. We bomb a country because they do not follow the same principles that we do, but we need to start asking ourselves this question  do we need another United States?Grade: ***** out of *****",Easy Rider

76,Richie-67-485852,Easy Viewing,6,23 March 2018,"This movie captured the spirit of its time quite well and there are parts in it that live on from one generation to the next making it a movie to be seen so one can say: Yes, I saw Easy Rider. Lets be frank and clear here. Selling and buying drugs, getting high all the time, having no aim in life, and repeating it daily is not an Easy life, but an uneasy life leaving nothing to do or rewards to attain and in anyway. Its like being in a coma. Nothing gets done yet time passes. The characters have no depth but that plays into the moral of the story and subject matter (drugs). They become entertainment of the dysfunctional kind letting us see what it is like to live this life without actually doing it. Yet for the many that tuned in when this was released and afterwards, it is the way they live and believe so it remains sort of a cult example for all to relate and identify with. The plan in this movie was to get enough money and retire in Florida? What then? This is never answered before, during and after this movie. Interesting to note that the actual players ( I wont call them actors) in this movie were living this life not only off-screen but on it as they were doing drugs and plotting along aimlessly daily. The concept and theme that is more healthy to pursue and learn here is to work for a living, use your money wisely, develop character along the way and hope for the best. Life is like a gold mine where the mother lode is found often deep within and must be mined literally to reach it. This movie teaches the opposite. Be entertained but don't be tempted to make this your credo. Just treat it as...",Easy Rider
77,sharky_55,We blew it,8,25 May 2016,"In Easy Rider, Dennis Hopper spends a great deal of time initially and throughout telling us what exactly these two characters treasure and how they act. We see the sun-drenched landscapes, the dusty plains, the extreme close-ups of their motorcycles and striped helmets and leather jackets before any sort of plot is established. Their swagger is silent and full of masculinity and attitude; the rock- heavy soundtrack, full of Hendrix and The Bryds and Steppenwolf, do the talking for them. They are drifters, with no place but the long, unwinding road to call home. Hopper envisions them as modern western heroes, bouncing from settlement to settlement without a pre-determined cause (Mardi Gras is a vague objective, but of course they never reach it), rolling past Monument Valley, resting by campfire at dusk, the strong, silent Eastwood type. Easy Rider is about a very specific experience of the American counter-culture and how it vanished almost overnight. Wyatt and Billy are not peace-loving, free-for-all full blown hippies; we know they are smuggling heroin, and we know that they have been paid quite well for it and are not about to throw that away for some sort of vague life philosophy. Of course their brief, clipped dialogue is full of ideas like the loss of meaning and the desire to flee from the urban (without any outwardly spoken reason). They lather praise on a farmer for being able to live off the land and nothing else. But they are still sensible and 'selfish' enough to be able to walk into diners and want commercial prepared food. The biggest cultural shock of sorts is when they stay at a commune and see the real hippies in their environment. The refer to a stage for theatre that is little more than a cloth propped up by sticks. The cameras spins dizzily around the circle as they engage in bizarre nature rituals that plead the barren land to sprout forth and feed them because the idea of shopping or eating out is reprehensible and unthinkable. The pair do not ever descend to this level - the vital point is that they are nevertheless branded as part of it anyway. The editing, if anything, dates the overall presentation. Wyatt keeps ""seeing things jumping all over the place"" and Hopper responds with a dizzying array of choppy cuts and haphazard zoom in and outs that are designed to be deliberately arresting (and get continually more and more abrasive). The cuts will abruptly interrupt their 'born to be wild' hero montages like a skipping disc and mute their accompanying soundtracks to render them tiny and insignificant (the most jarring of which is in the opening). Sometimes we see flashy, frenetic images of the sun piercing through the treetops - this seems to mimic the rush that accompanies the drug-fueled, semi-conscious state of drifting through the states on a motorcycle. Most of the time there is not much method to the madness. The most striking sequence is the group's reaction to a bad LSD trip - characterised by an increasingly chaotic and kaleidoscopic sensory array of rapid cuts, warped POVs, a convulsing camera and a cacophony of nonsense and gibberish. This vague, disorientating blast of stimuli has become the go-to portrayal of drug trips for many more films thereafter. It is not hard to suggest that Hopper and crew were probably on the same sort of stuff. Somewhere in the middle of all this is Nicholson's Hanson, who is initially an enigma. We don't expect a man so well dressed with his suit and tie to be rounded up and thrown into the same jail cell as these 'hippies'. There is a brief bit of genius here in amidst our first impressions of him; Billy looks to start an argument after Hanson wakes them up, and the shot is composed as if Hanson is leering from behind another cell, the men separated by thick bars. But of course this is not the case - Hopper exposes their empty masculinity, crude threats and road-warrior personalities for the facade that it is. These people just want to settle down. They don't want to live off the land, although they have enough sense to admire it. They have respect for a life cruelly taken, but are also weak enough to succumb to material pleasures and forget all about their final promise to Hanson. And in their final moments they barely put up a fight, but are snuffed out as easily as the very campfires they sleep beside. This might seem shocking or abrupt to the modern viewer, but it simply makes sense, in a sad, resigned sort of way. We knew it was coming. It was a tragedy all along, and no amount of sunlight hitting the motorcycle engine just the right way or windswept hair can change that.",Easy Rider
78,johno-21,1960's counter-culture road picture classic,8,17 April 2006,"I first saw this during it's initial theatrical release and saw it more than once on the big screen when it first came out and have seen it many times since. Peter Fonda, Dennis Hopper and Jack Nicholson had made attempts into the counter-culture film genre before with Nicholson writing roger Corman's 1967 film The Trip that starred Fonda and Hopper and Nicholson starred on screen in Hell's Angels on Wheels in 1967 and Psych Out in 1968. Hopper had played many edgy roles on film and television so it wasn't a big stretch for him as the hippy drug dealing biker but Fonda had been known for a lot a squeaky clean roles and he really pulls off a great Captain America here as a drug dealing hippy biker. Nicholson in a preview of his on screen greatness to come pulls the film together and even back then he steals the scenes from the better know actors in Fonda and Hopper. Also in the cast look for Karen black, Phil Spector and as extras, Dan Haggerty, Carrie Snodgress and Bridget Fonda. Fonda and Hopper wrote the screenplay along with Terry Southern. Southern had been best known for his screenplay for Stanley Kubricks Dr. Strangelove and had also did the Screenplay for Barbarella staring Fonda's sister Jane. Easy Rider was made between two filmed adaptations of Southern's novels Candy and The Magic Christian and just after Barbarella. Easy Rider is a road picture with very little plot but was everything that a big Hollywood feature of the time wasn't and was important to independent films getting distribution. I think everyone expected this to be a drive-in movie and then disappear but it turned out to have legs (or wheels) and is loaded with great music of it's generation. It's got a lot of flaws but was an important film and it got a lot of recognition wining awards from the Cannes film Festival, the National society of Film Critics and New York Film Critics and the film industry Laurel Awards as well as Golden globe and Directors Guild nominations. An impressive directorial debut for Dennis Hopper. I would give it a 8.5 out of 10.",Easy Rider
79,Stampsfightclub,Relative artistic approach to the 60s,8,11 February 2009,"In the 1960's, Wyatt (Fonda) and Billy (Hopper) head on a journey on their motorbikes to New Orleans in search of America.2004 and the Motorcycle Diaries is released. The visionary direction by Walter Salles is spectacular. Revolving around two men going on a journey before their lives begin, the film is a definitive movie in motorcycle history and being a huge fan, I knew Easy Rider would be a necessity to continue my knowledge into the world of motorcycles.But it did more than that. Not only is Easy Rider equally visionary and spectacular in its approach to the world of bikes, it preaches through its hard hitting issues that reflect the dramatic times of the 60's.Born in the late 80's, my knowledge of the 60's expands to funky clothes and classic music. Watching this film is like taking that first breathe of fresh air as you step out of the house. It breathes issues and entertainment onto a time that reflects the dramatic and significant time in American culture.The issues revolving around drugs in particular are unforgivably hard hitting, the LSD scene is the finest drug scene certainly I have ever watched, very sharp and realistic.The narrative takes into account the approaches to appearances, as evident in the café scene when the pair (including Nicholson's George) is decoded as bad people based on what they wear. With today's modern stereotypes including tracksuit wearing chavs or baggy clothed moshers taking a beating, it is almost easy to forget the way hippies were represented and frowned upon, especially the consequences they were dealt to. Here that is unbelievably executed by one of the most devastating endings you will ever see.Acting wise plaudits go to Jack Nicholson. His introduction spreads energy through the plot with a role contrast to his normal famous roles as Randall McMurphy and Jack Torrance. Fonda and Hopper do well but it's Nicholson who deserves praise.The direction however is the key element. Hopper's approach is very artistic and though brilliant, feels like an art project for the first hour without much happening in the plot. Once Nicholson enters the plot has a purpose and begins to generate that necessary realism as Hopper chooses different shots again. The cut back shots from one scene to the next and back again further increase the talent of the Speed actor and help project that devastating realism of a time this film isn't afraid to reflect.",Easy Rider
80,TOMASBBloodhound,"Says a lot about the counterculture, and not all of it is good.",8,1 September 2008,"More like a time capsule than a typical feature film, Easy Rider takes the viewer back to the late 1960s in America. For those of us who were not living at this time, the ideals of the film are still easy enough to understand. Made on a virtually non-existent budget, this motorcycle road picture plays out like a drug induced trip. The earlier stages more relaxed like the effects of pot, and the latter stages playing out like a bad LSD trip. Drugs are pretty much the central theme here. Not so much the attempt to live in freedom. That's the thing about the counterculture. It may have started up as a true rebellion to a conformist society, but ultimately the drugs became the central theme. Not just a side story.The story is very simple. A couple of ""dudes"" played by Dennis Hopper and Peter Fonda make a drug deal with a guy in a limo played by Phil Spector. They use the profits to take a trip to Mardi Gras. Along the way they meet all sorts of odd characters, and not all of them are friendly. The guys pick up a hitchhiker and he leads them into a hippie commune that really looks like an awful place to be. There is nothing about this commune that is glorified. Hopper, who plays many of his scenes like he is tripping, seems mortified by these people and just wants them to get back on the road. Fonda seems much more laid back and comfortable in this and just about any environment he is presented with. Next, the two are arrested for disrupting a parade in a tiny town. They meet up with Jack Nicholson's drunken alcoholic character in jail, and he ends up joining them (all too briefly) on their trip. Once the guys get to rural Louisiana, they encounter some angry rednecks in a diner and things go downhill from there. There is a really odd acid trip that gets filmed in a cemetery in New Orleans that is effective, but it really doesn't add anything to the plot. Once Mardi Gras is left behind the party is basically over in more ways than one for our heroes. The tragic conclusion is not hard to see coming.Easy Rider is a film made by some obviously drugged up individuals. It is at its best when an old song is playing while the guys are driving through some very beautiful American scenery. Whenever anyone gets off the bikes and talks, the film drags... literally! Because all anyone seems to do is take drags off joints! Not much of the dialog in this film had much meaning to me. Nicholson has some good lines, and Fonda's remark toward the end saying, ""We blew it, Billy"" is prophetic, not only about their own predicament, but also the counterculture in general. These people all started out with some big ideals, but in the end, it was the drugs that ruined it for them.This film is not for all tastes. If you don't have an attention span, and you probably know who you are, then don't try to watch it. If you are interested in the late 1960s and the counterculture, then you will probably like it. I see the film as an interesting time capsule with a few glaring faults. But it will remain talked about and watched for years and years to come. In many ways it is a landmark of American pop culture. 8 of 10 stars.The Hound.",Easy Rider
81,khanbaliq2,"Tossing wristwatches away, two bikers hit the road to find America in Hopper's anti-establishment classic.",10,21 May 2010,"Easy Rider is a landmark counterculture film, and a ""touchstone for a generation"" that ""captured the national imagination"". Two hippie drop-outs (Peter Fonda and Dennis Hopper) ride from California to New Orleans, looking for the soul of America and hoping to conclude a drug deal.A film that sent shock waves through Hollywood, opening up possibilities for a new, young, dissident generation of film-makers, actors and film audiences. Essentially, it's a great soundtrack held together by attractive landscape imagery, some rambling conversational set-pieces and a wildly melodramatic ending, but it chimed with the spirit of its turbulent times to a remarkable extent. Fonda and Hopper don't have to say or do much, so it's left to Jack Nicholson, as a drink-sodden attorney, to voice the sour dissatisfaction with America that lies at the story's heart. It would be his major breakthrough film.",Easy Rider
82,gab-14712,Sadly Overrated!,7,6 December 2018,"To many film pundits, 1969's Easy Rider is a groundbreaking avant garde (or experimental in layman terms) film. In a way, I agree with them. Motorcycle films were seen as cheap ho-hum exploitation films that no one cares about, but this film changed the way films were made. This film made it clear that films that were known in Old Hollywood was to be no more. The road was paved for New Hollywood and it shows that independent film can be successfully given to mainstream audiences. After all, this film was the third-highest grossing film of 1969 ($41 million dollars to a budget of a very small $400,000). I also found the movie to be a boring and frankly quite overrated. This film definitely appealed to the teens and college kids of the 1960's counterculture era, but we live in a different world today. This movie felt equivalent of taking a boatload of LSD's, and the effect quickly wore off for me. There are moments of greatness, but the overall film doesn't live up to the hype.Wyatt (Peter Fonda) and Billy (Dennis Hopper) are two hippie bikers who smuggled cocaine across the Mexican border to earn money and travel their way across America to live the American dream. After selling the cocaine (to rock icon Phil Spector of all people), it's time for them to begin their odyssey. They take their bikes and roar down the highways going from Point A to Point B. Everywhere they go, they encounter people who hate them for not conforming with American society. They also encounter people just like them. They meet people at a hippie commune. They also meet a liberal tax evasion lawyer in a jail cell, George Hanson (Jack Nicholson). When released, they invite Hanson to go on the journey with them to Mardi Gras in New Orleans.Jack Nicholson's performance is the main positive highlight for me. His screen time is limited, but he nails the role as the alcoholic George. One funny moment for myself is that I thought Peter Fonda's character was actually Jack Nicholson at first. I guess they look alike during this time period. Regardless, Nicholson delivered and began a long acting career thanks to this movie. Peter Fonda and Dennis Hopper were merely okay. I wasn't too much invested in their characters.Speaking of Dennis Hopper, he was the one who directed the movie. As a first-time director, he changed cinematic history for the better and that is no easy feat. You can tell he has directorial talent, but you can also see he has much to learn. At least he got a magnificent performance out of Jack Nicholson. I also liked what the story is trying to convey. I learned some things about the 1960's counterculture era where young people were beginning to conform against society. This is the kind of thing that hasn't been seen on screen before, so it was definitely something new for audiences to take in. The soundtrack of the movie is A plus. Any soundtrack that has Bob Dylan, The Band, The Byrds, and Steppenwolf deserves a gold medal.That leads me to my next point. The movie is just basically a 95-minute glorified music video. All these songs are great and they fit the mold of the counterculture era, but it does nothing to the plot. One of the biggest complaints about the movie is that the plot is nonexistent, which I sadly agree with. Usually, I don't mind drug use in a movie, but I was irritated by the amount of drugs used. Calm down, people! On the whole, this was a fascinating watch. On one hand, this is a ground-breaking movie with some solid ideas and a fantastic Jack Nicholson performance. On the other hand, I felt like a psychedelic after watching it. The music, the drugs, the hippie experience.....and I am not sure how I feel about that. This may be an unpopular opinion, but I was disappointed after hearing so many people in the film world rave about this film. But, that is just me.My Grade: C+",Easy Rider
83,The_Movie_Cat,Cheesy Rider,7,2 April 2000,"Easy Rider was released a good couple of years before I was even conceived, so its sixties backdrop and vague political stance have no first-hand relevance for me.So as a child of the 70s generation, what does it hold? Well, probably the most shocking thing in the movie nowadays is Toni Basil as a lithe prostitute, baring her breasts. The one-hit wonder (but what a hit) with Mickey in 1981, seeing her exposed derriere means when she innocently dresses up as a cheerleader I can never look at her in quite the same way again.Then theres Jack Nicholson, making an impact as a drunken lawyer with a stereotyped southern twang. Paid less than the union rate at just $2000, five years after this film was made he was earning a million dollars a movie, and the year after that his first Oscar. While only having a brief role, Nicholson acts as a perfect counterpoint to Hopper and Fondas characters. And what of Fonda and Hopper themselves? Well, the much-vaunted feud still continues, it seems. After famous spats during filming (one alleged incident involved Fonda threatening to defend himself against any attack by Hopper by hitting him in the face with a motorcycle chain  youll find thats a motherf****r he reportedly said), the two have still not made up. A recent 30th Anniversary Convention saw them on stage together for the first time, where Hopper accepted an apology because its kudos to accept, though stated that he normally wouldnt talk to someone who had described him as a f*****g Nazi.Of course, the real plaudits go to this film for being produced on less than $400,000 and grossing more than $50 million. Effectively, it opened the gates to a slew of youth cinema and, so the cliché goes, changed the face of movies forever. This is something that cannot be taken away from Easy Rider. But taken on its own terms  that is, it being a single movie  is it actually any good? Well, performances and direction cannot be faulted. But ultimately the film is a meandering one, covering the story of two bikers travelling to Mardi Gras in New Orleans to a backdrop of mundane country and western music. A song that has as a chorus dont Bogart that joint, my friend  pass it over to me is the highlight in a stirring banality of incidentals, only punctuated by thankful bursts of Steppenwolf and Hendrix. In fact, the whole pace of the picture is laborious, reflecting its drug-laden theme. In terms of incident, nothing much happens until an hour and ten minutes into the movie, and then again only towards the admittedly stunning conclusion. What I cant really comprehend is the critical lauding of the movies content, with some excitingly blathering about the blistering attacks on American conservatism. To be honest, apart from one or two small references, there really isnt any political thread to this picture. Slight references to statues of God do not religious symbolism make, yet there are countless websites thrown up in awe of this dialogue-light exploitation picture. Its nice enough to look at, and while you can respect its art, in a modern context its pretty hard to take it all so seriously. Maybe Im just too young to really dig it, man. 7/10.",Easy Rider
84,SmileysWorld,An acid trip put on film.,5,23 January 2007,"I will give this film high marks for being a good lesson in not judging a book by it's cover.Why is it that we are automatically afraid of whose who are different than us?Perhaps fear is the only emotion we train ourselves to feel.We automatically go into a mode of defense when we encounter someone we perceive to be a threat to us.Why?We may never know.While I will give the film a high mark in this area,I am afraid I have problems with the film otherwise.The whole film looks as though it was conceived,written,and finally produced on an acid trip.It is immersed,in my opinion,in surrealism,and while I don't argue with what the AFI,or devout fans,call a great film,in the end,it just isn't my cup of tea.Also,I cannot end my comments without mentioning the church scene.Being a devoutly religious person,I cannot help but deduct more points for the blatant sacrilegious overtones that this scene contains.In the end,and my apologies to fans everywhere,this is most likely my last journey with Easy Rider.",Easy Rider
85,Pedro_H,Classic case of content overcoming technique - a cinema milestone in anyone's book.,8,24 April 2007,"A couple of young guys (played by Peter Fonda and Denis Hopper) decide to ""rebel"" by becoming drug smugglers - and then become ""free"" on a slow motorcycle ride through the backwaters of America.Art is no different from any other aspect of life. You can get lucky. Or more accurately, luck can add to your skill and take it that grade higher. What painters call a ""happy accident."" This was the right film at the right time and despite fine work all round, especially Jack Nicolson who became a star on the back of his short performance as boozed-out back roads lawyer, it is clearly a B movie. A smart one - but that doesn't change the fact.For those that never saw the hippie movement first hand or those that didn't see the American dream of freedom die (or at least change) this might not quite hit the mark. Indeed it doesn't quite hit the mark with me and I saw the sixties - although at a very young age. What kind of person needs to live in a world of controlled self-poisoning other than people that don't like reality?The Terry Southern script was probably written on the back of cigarette packet and actor/director Hopper was merely reflecting what he knew and felt at the time. A lot of intensity, but too little intelligence. Dope does that to you - making you think you are profound when you are just waffling. As a director he is (today) a proved mediocrity, although not without low budget merit.I actually like the American hinterlands. Too often ignored in movies (apart from Westerns) they are strangely serene and poetic, a land with the luxury of space where people even wave as you go past. The oldie soundtrack helps. This is what the good ol' USA is based on - cheap land and cheap oil and people that rarely feature in media. The unseen majority.This film made lots of money and lots of noise. As critic Roger Ebert said ""the kind of movie that people went back to watch again and again."" Rather like Woodstock. I am sure that plenty have it in their DVD collection as well - having upgraded from video. It represents something that certain people want to own, if not actually watch.The long hair and the bikes alienate some of the locals and this brings in the cod melodrama that the movie needs, but doesn't hold water as drama. How would the locals know where the guys were camping or why would a lawyer take off with this drifters - has he no office to go to or no clients to see to? Indeed is he a working lawyer at all - sure the cops seem to believe he is, but maybe they want an easy life. If you went in to the cells claiming to be Napoleon they would go along with it.Indeed the back story is weak (a lot of the scenes got cut) and we don't get any kind of strong hold on the Captain America (Peter Fonda) character at all. Naked girls, drug dealing, prostitutes, dangerous rednecks, it all seems the same to him. Good acting or no acting - you decide.Easy Rider is an experience. Maybe they should include a joint in the DVD packaging! It will be less of an experience to those watching today as young people. I have no doubt that if IMDb was around in the late 60's this would be one of the top two hundred films. Every generation will mark this film down a notch until it becomes what it is bound to become in the long run: a cult picture that captures a time, a place and a mentality that no longer exists. It probably only existed in the minds of a few hippies at the time anyway and I have never had much time for them. Too lazy, too leaching and too easily satisfied.",Easy Rider
86,Ben_Cheshire,The Times They Are A'Changin',6,22 April 2004,"A lot of people rate Easy Rider compared to their expectations, which are most likely not what they get. Easy Rider made waves because it was not what anyone expected - there's no romance, there's little plot, characters come and go just like people do when you're on a road trip, not only are there not good wholesome values, but it hails anti-establishment values. Its filled with hippies, communes, seemingly irrelevent encounters with strangers, naked swimming and free love. But mainly, its filled with highway.Billy and Captain America just take to the road and ride throughout the movie. They come across people and situations every now and then, but mostly they ride while a super-cool soundtrack of late-60's tunes from Jimi Hendrix, Bob Dylan, The Byrds, Steppanwolf and more play. One of the people they come across, when they're put in jail in one town for ""parading without a licence"" is Jack Nicholson, in the role that made him a star. He had appeared in a few Roger Corman pictures before this, but after Easy Rider he was big time.Easy Rider was the coolest thing anybody had ever seen in 1969, and over three decades later, now most people aren't stoned anymore, i still think its one of the coolest movies ever made. You appreciate it even more if you know a little about the impact it had, which you can find out from Ted Demme's fun doco ""A Decade Under the Influence"".I could totally understand why people found this so exciting - i understood it from the moment ""Born to be Wild"" began to play, and Billy and Captain American started out on the highway and the words ""Easy Rider"" came on the screen. To appreciate the freedom and landmark nature of this movie, you've got to have seen a few movies from the 50's and 60's, and while you might love them, appreciate the artificiality and conservativeness of the world they existed in. Easy Rider was a couple of ""longhairs,"" or hippies, cutting loose, hitting the road, and damn what the powers that be thought about it. It was the first real anti-establishment movie allowed by a major studio, which is why it was so influential. It began the major movement of moviemaking in America in the 70's of tough, edgy realism.Today, i think we can appreciate Easy Rider both for its sense of freedom and cool, and for the value of feeling what America felt like in 1969.",Easy Rider
87,RanchoTuVu,both dated and timeless,8,24 February 2011,"As a road movie Easy Rider seems to fall apart due to the dated dialog spewing forth from the mouths of the dated hippies they meet on their journey to New Orleans. It's bad enough to make you wish they would have just taken a flight back there to New Orleans instead of ""doing their own thing in their own time"" on the Harley's. However, Easy Rider improves on Dennis Hopper's and Peter Fonda's arrival in New Orleans for Mardi Gras, where they go to the whore house recommended to them by Jack Nicholson earlier in the film and drop acid with two of the girls. This is Easy Rider's real trip, not at all dated, or if it is, it's dated in a way that really captures the swirling drug culture of the late 1960s. But that's only an interlude for the boys as they embark on their return journey back to California and encounter the violent red-neck reaction to the counter-culture.",Easy Rider

The film is dark, brooding, intense and most of all depressing. One knows from the start that there is no way for it to really end well. It's fun watching it. Its complexity begins within its characters. It's an amazing work and everything I had hoped for. From an artistic standpoint, there were some plot elements and character developments I didn't think were totally needed. This is one of those movies that had bad timing when it came to its release.

90,virek213,"EASY RIDER: Dated In Places, But Still Quite Relevant Today",8,9 November 2018,"It's a well-known fact that EASY RIDER is a touchstone film of late 1960s Hollywood, one in which the youth market overtook the old Hollywood studio system and, even if they didn't destroy it, they changed it in such a way that it could never go back again.There is only a small need to revisit the plot: these two guys on Harleys, producer/co-writer Peter Fonda and co-writer and director Dennis Hopper, take a ride across the country to find the heart and soul of America, all the while fueling their journey with plenty of grass and powder, but what they find is disillusionment and a whole hell of a lot of distrust...especially once they get into that part of America known as the Bible Belt, where people who look like them are looked upon with disdain. All of this is fueled by a radical 1960a soundtrack that includes FM rock standards by Steppenwolf (""Born To Be Wild""; ""The Pusher""); Fraternity Of Man (""Don't Bogart That Joint""), Jimi Hendrix (""If 6 Was 9""), and the Byrds (""Wasn't Born To Follow""), among others.But while all this is evident, it should be noted that EASY RIDER, which was made for a mere $400,000, not only put Fonda and Hopper in the realm of 1960s anti-heroes, as well as actors, it also helped establish the careers of at least two soon-to-be Hollywood acting heavyweights. Karen Black is one of those; she plays one of the prostitutes that Hopper and Fonda meet in New Orleans. The other one, of course, is the great inebriated small-town lawyer George Hansen, portrayed by none other than Jack Nicholson. Indeed, even if much of the rest of the film is clearly still stuck in its 1969 time warp, Nicholson's performance remains timeless, with his incredible eccentricities, Southern-fried drawl, and crazy philosophy, But it is really in the fireside scene where he lectures both Fonda and Hopper about the nature of what they represent to those in Red State America, who view ""longhairs"" like them as Commies, not ""true"" Americans; and that their idea of freedom is not what Hopper and Fonda view it as. As Nicholson tells them: ""They're gonna talk to you, and talk to you, and talk to you about individual freedom; but they see a free individual it's gonna scare 'em.""As of this date, almost half a century has passed since this landmark film hit screens during the long, hot summer of 1969, and, though a lot of EASY RIDER is very dated (hear how many times Hopper utters ""Man!"" throughout the film, plus a lot of weird psychedelic scenes), a lot of it remains relevant because, sadly, very little about America has necessarily changed for the better; and indeed, a lot has gotten noticeably worse since. Besides both Black and Nicholson, Fonda and Hopper got some of their close circle of Hollywood friends like Warren Finnerty, Luke Askew, Toni Basil (she later had a #1 pop hit with ""Mickey"" in 1982), and Robert Walker, to appear here, along with the innovative cinematography of Lazslo Kovacs.All in all, EASY RIDER, despite its datedness, remains a must-see movie to understand what America was like as the 1960s came to a close, and what changes have been wrought since then.",Easy Rider
91,gigan-92,"""We blew it.""",10,16 November 2011,"Dennis Hopper's Easy Rider (1969). It employs many techniques that would become common practice without the untrained eye's notice. One of the main attractions to the film playing to the sound category would be its luscious soundtrack. It featured songs by various artists of The Band, The Jimi Hendrix Experience, and Steppenwolf, and much more. The music in the film in a word represents the search for 'freedom'. Note that the songs are always played as the duo of Dennis Hopper (Billy) and Peter Fonda (Wyatt) is on the road. The songs not only represent a specific time in our nation's history, at the peak of the late sixties psychedelic rock, but it it's also meant to enhance the natural beauty of the many landmarks they see on their journey. It creates a dream-like state of innocence because we are not shown the dull grays of the skyscrapers we're accustomed to. This adds to the idea of a secure purity thru simplicity as a bit of subtle symbolism as the two 'nomads' as they encounter various 'simple folk' in the form of country people and hippies.Another, and perhaps one of the most important components of sound in a movie, is the delivery of its dialogue. It's not just the lines themselves, although that's not to be reduced to negligence because films like the Transformers and Pearl Harbor (2001), tow popular Michael Bay films, specialize as all his films do in on-the-nose dialogue. On-the-nose dialogue finds it annoyingly necessary to repeatedly restate the obvious and try to level with the slow audience members who can't keep track of what's going on. This wears old quickly, and by the time one gets to the third film in the Transformers franchise you can literally predict each line. Peter Fonda's writing and direction are much more artistic and ambiguous, to my joy. Note the subtext of each voice in the film. Consider how Jack Nicholson's character is constantly rambling on in a drunken or intoxicated manner. It adds comedic contrast to the quest of the two other main characters, and yet it adds even more in the scene just before his murder. The characters are almost like children on a simple camping trip, chattering over the most random yet down to earth conversation ever. They speak of extraterrestrial beings, but really the whole scene is about the possibility of life beyond Earth, about the whole scope of man's miniscule stature in this familiar world; the kinetic curiosity of men wondering about things that which the y may never fully understand. When the group is attacked and suffer a heart-breaking casualty, the scenes prior make the moment truly heart breaking.One of the seemingly most vague lines in the film is delivered near its climax, where despite the all the money they've made Wyatt reflects on it all and can only say 'We blew it"". It takes a deep internal inspection of not just the film itself but of one's own morality and conception of the world to pull any sense of it. In a similar fashion that Richard Kelly used in Donnie Darko (2001), I believe the theme of the film can breed a multitude of interpretations. For myself, I believe it was the search for a greater benevolent force behind the ugly violence that is the world. In a sense it was a quest for a certain sense of nirvana, specifically for Wyatt, who observed the simplified life of the strangers they met and marveled at them. Note how his friend always rushed but he always insisted on staying at each destination a little longer. That was his inner unseen motive that drove him, and the main reason why the character spent so much of the film on drugs. The LSD scene for example, you see him in the arms of a religious statue, perhaps suggesting in a somewhat nihilistic sense that in the desperate search for enlightenment sometimes all a man can do is turn to a distorted view of the world he himself created (thru the drugs obviously). The film ends on a bitter and tragic note because despite his well meaning, Wyatt never receives the spiritual enlightenment he was searching for.Of course I could also go into how the film subtly critiques the values of the so called freedom we have in America, but that'd be another essay in itself.",Easy Rider
92,mfellipecampos,Good,7,21 May 2020,"Classic from the 60s. An American film that talks a lot, without saying a lot. It is a film that to watch you have to understand the time, that way you will be able to realize that the story is simple and there, perhaps, is its great eloquence. Because the film talks about not following standards, without it being like an open speech, but present in the film at all times. It speaks of another form of making cinema, in addition to the Hollywood model, It speaks of freedom, but it evidences certain symbolic prisons for this search for freedom - money and drugs, even if they do not use money in an arbitrary / exaggerated way, (contains spoilers ), there is a scene where they say they got rich and are concerned that others don't find out where they hid the money. Finally, the film shows that incomprehension and the standards adopted as accepted can end the dream of freedom, without thinking twice.Movie seen on May 10, 2020",Easy Rider
93,raypdaley182,A film of it's time that should have stayed there.,4,21 April 2006,"A few things about this before the actual review. I don't think Peter Fonda is a very experienced rider at all. He wobbles & jerks a lot on the chopper. He looks like he could have done with a lot more practice riding it. Hopper looks the more natural biker of the two.I didn't fancy staying up to watch this so I taped it. And as is always the way the damn thing started early so I missed a little of the start, Fonda & Hopper were already in the junkyard doing their drug deal, so I don't exactly know about the what's and why's of the start.The film is a very psychedelic look at late 60's America, It's almost like someone read some Jack Kerouac and decided to make it into a film. The film makes a very definite statement from the moment Fonda drops his watch before they set out on the road. They have no need to measure time or to know anything exact.They trip happily along having small things happen, A flat tire, picking up a hike-hiker (I almost thought he'd stolen their money when he said the gasoline had been taken care of), Taking him to the commune (that is one weird series of scenes) and then being arrested by the police for crashing a parade.Finally here they meet Jack Nicolson as a strange southern lawyer who has been arrested and gets them free. They finally wear helmets on their bikes (I assume they are riding through states and counties that have helmet laws) and Nicolson is wearing a Football helmet of all things. Though I guess it would protect him as well in a crash.During the camp fire discussion about Venusians, I totally got where Robin Williams' Mork got his ideas for ""The Friends Of Venus"" because he totally sounds like Nicolson. I also noticed later he was doing the whole braces over a t-shirt thing like Mork too.The scene in the café was heavily laced with bigotry, I'm amazed to think people could have ever been so narrow minded. Even towards people of their own color and very much so to how they spoke about the US flag. It makes me wonder how many people in America still don't seem to realize how long the civil war has been over.I assume the southern rednecks attacked the riders during the night (even though it seemed like a dream sequence) and they killed Nicolson even though he was most southern and respectable looking of the 3 men.The visit to the brothel is very quiet, subdued. The scenes play out very quietly like they are hard to perform until they go out onto the streets into the Mardi Gras. For those scenes the film takes on a very amateur film look, not well focused and color looking washed out.In the graveyard you get another one of the many ""Cut-together"" shots and very rapidly cut to and from various points of view which is difficult to watch and even harder to pay attention to.The characters are tripping, some on very bad trips but this quickly cuts to Fonda & Hopper having another fireside scene which seems to make no sense at all and then are back on the road again to somewhere else.The man who shoots Hopper has no reason, likewise when Fonda is killed. They are just 2 men on motorcycle's who the 2 rednecks take a dislike to and decide to scare them and end up killing them both. The film seems to simply have run out of ideas so they kill the remaining 2 main characters. The whole idea that they were going somewhere with their money to do something is suddenly lost.I totally didn't notice Toni Basil (yes, the same one of 80's fame who sang Mickey!) as the dark haired hooker Mary. Mind you I did notice Dan Haggerty AKA Grizzly Adams who it turns out built the bikes featured in the film.",Easy Rider
94,Horror-yo,A bit dumb and confused,3,12 December 2017,"So the film starts off looking like it's going to be the cinematic depiction of the playing song ""Born to be wild"". Shortly after, we discover there's a sort of spiritual/religious aspect to the plot, like the film means to clearly establish its acknowledgment of the christian faith, like there's some sort of dichotomy occurring between American tradition with its symbolism and meaning versus the late 60's hippy movement with all its abandonment of the said christian values, and the emphasis on drugs, procrastination and promiscuous sex. But the rapport is never actually established, both worlds are sort of intertwined and feed off each other, sort of, but there's no actual commentary on that or even any implied clarification. It's just ...there. Like Fonda and Hopper just wanted it to be there, for no actual purpose and without actually saying anything.When the film isn't showing the 'dudes' wasting their lives away with random acts of pointless hedonistic pleasure, it's displaying the beautiful landscapes of America on the road from the West coast (L.A.) to the southern states (New Orleans) with iconic rock and country songs from the time as they're riding their majestic bikes, the great big token of ""freedom"". The thing here is if I wanted to watch beautiful landscapes, I'd tune into a proper documentary about it which would be 20x better.The acting is weak from both leads, although Nicholson does well the little time he gets any screen action. The film drops in a total downward spiral that can't possibly provide any meaning to the viewer and the ending scene is a sort of activist biased criticism that plays the overly dramatic card in order to give the film a powerful closing, but it's cheap and random as hell.All in all, what does the film say that is substantial ?",Easy Rider

The worst part is when some people still see the rednecks here, and at the end of the film (and let's not forget the ones that attacked the camp) as 'misunderstood.' Sure, they can't help beating up people that aren't like them. That made George Hanson's (Jack Nicholson) spiel about freedom all the more relevant. And it's STILL true.Great cinematography during the riding scenes. Good supporting cast members. And the commune scene was brilliant.

97,PIST-OFF,Classic tale of human spirit and its demise.,9,22 April 1999,"Get your motor runnin' Head out on the highway....... So begins the tale of Easy Rider. A movie that taught an American generation how to express themselves. It also taught a lesson later learned in Deliverence, don't fool with southern yokels who yield no brain power or tolerance. I love this movie because it is well acted. I love the soundtrack. (How could you not?) I love its filming of the American landscape. The motorcycles are classic. Peter Fonda, Dennis Hopper and Jack Nicholson perfectly portray the three charecters who are now heroes of epic proportion. But I mostly love the sense of freedom and spontaniety that this movie gives off. The movie has so influenced me that I frequently will take long road trips on a moment's notice without hesitation. I commonly leave on 300+ mile road trips in the middle of the night. Sometimes if only to drive, sometimes to meet chicks, sometimes to kill boredom. Or in the case of my recent drive to Canada, to buy beer. You see I just turned 20 so Easy Rider has made me restless. Try catching someone else off guard. Everybody always says ""Man, we should just go off, just drive off and live life."" I like to challenge the group because you'll always find one person with an excuse and then the rest fall into place. Not me. Peter Fonda is alive and well in me.  4 stars. See it and live a little.",Easy Rider

There isn't much to tell about the story. Three strangers go on a quest and travel to get high or hit the road, that's pretty much it nothing else. I don't know if Peter Fonda and Denis Hopper did a good job or a bad one. The writing was pretty original and unique and they not only perform in the film, but they directed, wrote the script and produced the movie which is a lot for two man or outlaws in this case. Jack Nicholson keeps proving us he is nuts and that good cause he's really great in the film. The editing was rather rare then special, I don't know why would the editor make the film that way but it's rather rare, all the locations were nice, had a beautiful view.

Symbolizing the era, this remarkable and unique film makes casual statements on hatred and a society that for some is too structured and too organized. Dennis Hopper and Peter Fonda are great in the roles of the free-wheeling bikers, but Jack Nicholson's performance as the small-town lawyer who joins them is absolutely amazing.This ""Flower Power"" era blockbuster owes much of its phenomenal success to the soundtrack featuring Steppenwolf's ""Born To Be Wild"".

101,Rockwell_Cronenberg,"Accomplishes it's goals, but not my style.",4,1 February 2012,"Have you ever watched a movie where you feel that the filmmakers accomplished precisely what they were setting out to, but it just didn't appeal to you? That's what happened with Easy Rider and me. Peter Fonda and Dennis Hopper set out to do a few things. One, they wanted to display the death of the American dream. Two, they wanted to create the ultimate road movie. Three, they wanted to combine a killer soundtrack with some excellent appreciation of motorcycles. I feel like they nailed all of these things, but it never worked for me at all on my personal level.I have admittedly always been the kind of film admirer whose attention gravitates more towards narrative and complex, fleshed-out characters. With no real narrative structure and two thin, undeveloped lead characters, this film wasn't made for me. It's more of a mood piece, wrapped within it's thematic journey, and I feel that it absolutely captured what it wanted to be. I admire it a lot for that, but I still can't bring myself to say that I liked the film because it simply didn't appeal to my own personal taste.I loved the contrast between Hopper and Fonda's characters, the former still trying to live the dream while the latter is more morose, almost as if he's accepting his fate and trying to take in the beauty before the dream is dead. However, I feel that both actors drop the ball at points, with Hopper putting in too much and Fonda straining too hard to appear cool. Jack Nicholson comes into the picture like a born star, and he really runs away with the entire film.This is one of those rare performances that immediately draws your attention and whenever he is on screen, everything is pulled towards him. I couldn't take my eyes off of him, which is a tip of the hat to his skill as an actor, but as a supporting character it's more of a detriment to the film overall because my interest decreased drastically once Hopper and Fonda continued their adventure without him. Nicholson steals it, but there's still a lot to admire here from the main team behind it. I think they got it all right, but it just wasn't for me.",Easy Rider
102,jayjaycee,Read between the lines (of cocaine),8,20 March 2020,"""Easy Rider"" is a 1969 drama directed by Dennis Hopper starring him and Peter Fonda. This rewatch was long overdue and in the aftermath of my latest watch of ""Midnight Cowboy"" I thought it was the correct time to again check out the classic from the same year that deals with similar topics. Around a year ago, I already gave it a spin, during a time that was an extremely difficult period in my life in which I couldn't quite enjoy any film, and I honestly gotta say that I hated it back in the day. I remember having stated that ""it didn't make any sense at all"" or that it is an ""overrated"" film with ""no story, a horrible plot and too many wtf moments"". I'm not gonna deny that I said all of those things in the first place, but knowing now that my perception back than has been heavily disturbed by personal problems, I thought I'd give it another chance. As I expected, the outcome totally changed this time. It still has a number of flaws that are undeniable, but on the other hand has so much to offer that's secretly brilliant. Admittedly, both Fonda and Hopper don't really deliver a splendid achievement in terms of acting in here and are definitely not showing the brilliance I know they're both capable of, but therefore we get a short but absolutely outstanding performance by a young Jack Nicholson that simultaneously was his breakthrough in Hollywood. No, the film definitely didn't become a classic for memorable acting, but for the themes it shows and the values it stands for. It's an extremely slow paced flick with seemingly no substance that prefers to show shots of the beautiful landscapes and how the hippie protagonists traverse them with their fine looking choppers instead of delivering one brilliant dialogue after another, but when they start talking it's an unusual kind of art. Too much of it makes no sense at the first look, so you need to read between the lines. There's more than meets the eye. If you're able to appreciate this admittedly strange simplicity and experimentalism of Hopper's directorial style, you're in for a ride. The film's basically an ode to the counter culture and all its adherents and celebrates the freedom in its most fundamental form. Our protagonists, who increasingly become more and more sympathic, are key figures of the classic American dream, but instead of shattering thier perception immediately, the film is generally a more of a light-hearted take on this phenomenon and how it might even work out, studded with a number of subtle but grave instances of extreme criticism. Between all the seemingly nonsensical moments of enjoyment of sex, abuse of drugs and the exaggerated consumption of alcohol the film still manges to hit at the right spots. It primarily goes on at the overall hypocritical behaviour of the Americans themselves. The protagonists are literally living the dream in its fullest and what do most of the ""regular citizens"" do? They ridicule and heavily attack them for the length of their hair and living that way. As George Hanson fittingly states, there's a difference between talking about freedom and actually living it. It's the obvious hypocrisy and discrepancy the writers want to point out and in my opinion, they successfully did that. They are social outcasts with at times questionable worldviews, but represent all of what everyone's preaching about: Living in freedom. Living with no worries. Living the American dream. Yet, everything the people are doing is abhor them and it's this behaviour that gradually destroys the dream. The ending is nothing but a bold verdict of all that has been said before and that the film leaves the audience abruptly, literally on the road, makes this statement even more clearly in a depressing and devastating way. All in all, this film is an strangely experimental but important classic I deeply misunderstood upon the first time watch, but that offers so much brilliance to me now. This journey of outcasts is anything but ordinary and definitely no mainstream beauty, as it has some undeniable flaws, but still amazed me nevertheless. It's not everyone's darling, that's for sure. I mean, I hated it myself initially, but give it a chance and try to understand what this film stands for. Listen to the fitting soundtrack, admire the landscapes (that might even trigger someone's wanderlust) and listen to what the film wants to tell you. You're either gonna love it or hate it, but give it a try. Or two. In my case, it worked out eventually.",Easy Rider
103,PeterRoeder,A classic masterpiece,8,18 November 2009,"I just saw this great movie again. I must say it is a real masterpiece. The reason why I bought it on DVD is because I remembered the scene where Peter Fonda says: ""We blew it!"" That really touched me deeply, and I wanted to see it again in order to try to understand that mysterious remark. I think it is interesting that the characters in the movie are on a spiritual journey rather than a materialist one, and they sort of realize that in the world of the mind they have some how failed. It is very enigmatic what is going on in the movie, and you are, as a viewer, forced to watch it over and over again in order to try to understand it. The movie is also very nicely shot with some nice scenery from the American landscape.",Easy Rider
104,yris2002,Easy Ryder forty years later... has the myth faded?,8,4 July 2009,"Having come back from an exciting on the road voyage through American canyons, along the highways of California and Utah, I couldn't but feel like seeing cult road-pictures, and Easy Rider was the first on my list. I thought it was quite difficult and probably pointless trying to say something new, or original of a movie which is considered as a milestone in the history of cinema, and has been reviewed, analyzed, from every single perspective, so I believed it could be interesting instead to read some reviews of the time when it was released, to get a perception of how it was received by the audience, and by the establishment of that time, in order to make some reflections with reference to the modern world, after forty years have elapsed.My first impression of the main story involving the two outlaws, superbly interpreted by Peter Fonda and Dennis Hopper, was a kind of naturally human sympathy, however sometimes mixed up with a sense of annoyance: no doubt they appear as bold, daring, attractive in the way they challenge the constrictions of society. But after all, what are they looking for, do they have true Ideals, or are they just escaping, with money in their tanks, spending, wasting money for pleasure, are they so distant from every middle-class, working man serving the establishment every day?Indeed, as I read some critical reviews of that time, both Italian and American, I found out, with my great surprise, that the movie was not so favourably received, not only by the establishment, or by a certain right-winged thought, by also by the left-winged minded. The first, accusing it of immorality, of destroying all the solid American ideals and belief in self-commitment and hard work, the latter as having simplistically reduced the new values of freedom, peace, non-conformism, anti-consumerism, proposed by the hippie era into an aimless and egotistic search for nothing, into a total lack of anything positive for man.Truth lies probably in the middle, and probably both were right: on one hand, the story does not render justice to the complexity of the hippie era, to the true need for change lying beneath their communes, these people are quite naively portrayed and, today more evidently than once, appear as a little pathetic, so distant from the real world, on the other hand the world of the ""squares"" is presented as a world of selfish, cruel, disgusting people, capable of killing a man only for amusement: too an oversimplified and limited vision of society.Forty years of history may help us see through the scenes more clearly and with the necessary detachment. Certainly, history has taught that the capitalistic way of life had many deep flaws, in the same way as the hippie era has proved to be inconsistent, deflated without leaving anything credible sign, that's why that vision of society portrayed in Easy Rider, seems today still more naive, too easily simplified, and so far away from the complexity of today's world. The myth of those times, if it ever existed, has faded leaving a sense of nostalgia for times where probably ideals, however utopian, could still make people join together and move onwards.Out of time do the soundtrack and the amazing and the breathtaking scenery of the movie remain: no doubt that, today, like forty years ago, when you are driving along those roads, accompanied by some good music, you still feel freedom and life running through your veins: maybe something of that myth has survived, but probably because it'a part of human nature, then as much as now.",Easy Rider

106,jeremy3,Interesting on some levels,8,18 May 2007,"The movie was good, except for Dennis Hopper. Hopper has to be one of the most overrated actors. He hung on James Deans' coat tails. He made himself into the rebel from Easy Rider. However, his character was one-dimensional. He was basically a stoned dope. Despite Hopper's acting, Peter Fonda played a much deeper character. He was a hippy, but also a man of reason, respect, and peace. He flew in the face of all the stereotypes about hippies - by being kind, quiet, stoical, and a thinker. Jack Nicholson rescued the movie from boredom. He was a liberal dandy. It is funny how the redneck police officers respected him, because of his ""daddy warbucks"", but automatically hated the ""hippies"". That's what this movie was mostly about. In the Southwest, there was beautiful scenery. There were rednecks there, but no ""in your face"" rednecks. In Louisiana, there were ""in your face"" rednecks. If this was a documentary, perhaps the film could have looked into whether ""more settled areas"" produce greater class tensions. I loved the fact that the teenage girls loved the two hippies. Too bad there are no longer such innocent, carefree women like that anymore, who like anyone new and different. The redneck men of Louisiana, though, were portrayed as paranoid monsters. Some southern posters may find this unfair, but there was such glaring inequalities and racism in the South in 1969. It is only natural that these glaring inequalities were exaggerated for maximum effect on film. I don't like drugs, but the drugs were not offensively in one's face in this movie. The movie was about more that that. I liked the Phil Spector cameo. Look what's going on with him now. At first, I thought he was Michael Nesmith, but I know that the Monkees weren't into the drug scene. I also liked the hippie commune. A lot of them were ""from the cities"", yet trying to idealistically make a living in the desert (or other arid land). I liked it when the hippies turned on Dennis Hopper's character, and started sing about his long hair. This was showing that 1969 was not 1967, and that the social movement of the 60s was taming itself and becoming more conservative. It was only natural that idealism would temper itself to the conditions of the harsh realities of life in the hippie commune.",Easy Rider

The cinematography depicts a very beautiful portrait of the land of the United States.It was one of the first American films to use New Wave techniques such as jump shots, and for that, it was incredibly influential.However, I do have a little complaint about the ending of the film.

108,TheCorniestLemur,What even was the first half of this,5,12 November 2020,"So forget everything I said about Bait a few days ago, because this is one of the most ""nothing"" films I've ever seen.What that means to me is that nothing happens, nothing is set up or resolved, there's no running narrative, it just consists almost entirely of two dudes with long hair and motorbikes driving around, with roughly the first half seemingly having no point at all, and the second half dealing with the whole ""people hate what they don't understand"" thing, but by that point it's too late, because you don't care about the characters and have likely already figured out that that's the direction it would be going in.And sure, the second half is better than the first, but I can't begin to tell you just how thoroughly uninterested I was by that point, so while it is admittedly brave to make a film like this at the time, and while the LSD scene was really well directed, I just did not care anymore.It looks good, the performances are fine, but (I'm only saying it again because it's true) I cannot tell you how over it I was by the time something potentially interesting happened.",Easy Rider

111,antagonist117,Longhairs in John Ford's America,9,17 June 2013,"In a making-of documentary on the DVD release, director/co-star Dennis Hopper says that he wanted to depict a motorcycle trip ""through John Ford's America."" The landscape and cinematography are indeed reminiscent of Ford's westerns except that the cameras are mounted on moving cars and motorcycles, and the shots include power lines and paved highways in addition to buttes and canyons. A back-to-the-land theme is prominent, as when the bikers stop to fix a tire at a horse ranch, eat dinner with a large farm family, and eat home-grown food at a desert commune. ""All cities are the same,"" opines one character. ""I'm from the city, a long way from the city, and that's where I wanna be right now."" It is a city, New Orleans, with its gaudy excesses, that draws Hopper and Peter Fonda's characters, but as they approach that destination their adventures grow darker and more dangerous. A depiction of a bad acid trip in an above-ground cemetery should scuttle any notion that the movie romanticizes drug use, yet the cast and crew reportedly spent much of the shoot stoned. If true, then the high quality (no pun intended) of the acting and production are all the more remarkable. The soundtrack is a somewhat jarring time capsule, but changing it at this stage would be unthinkable.",Easy Rider
112,stevenfallonnyc,Very boring overrated movie,3,18 July 2019,"Oddly enough, despite being a lifelong film fan, I've just watched ""Easy Rider"" for the very first time. Given its reputation and the celebration of the film's fiftieth anniversary, I was finally prompted to watch.I was pretty mystified at what I found, which was a very boring, slow-moving non-movie which resembled more of a travelogue of sixties America.In short, for almost the entire duration of the movie, nothing happens. This is a 20-minute short film stretched out into an excruciatingly dull full-length feature. What you mainly get are three things - plenty of shots of Peter Fonda and Dennis Hopper riding their bikes, views of the countryside as they are riding their bikes, and them hanging by the fire at night speaking gibberish either between themselves or with whomever they are giving a ride to.There is almost none of the supposed ""bigotry and hatred"" from small-town America that is supposed to be a focal point. There is one scene in a small diner where they felt some tension from the locals, and they got out of there quick. Even when a bunch of young girls pay attention to the bikers - even following them outside - the locals remain inside, simply peeking out the window.They're heading to New Orleans for the Mardi Gras, and hoping to find, I don't know, something along the way, peace maybe, or who knows. This horrifically dull trip picks up a little interest when Jack Nicholson joins them, but even he can't save the movie from being dull, especially with his bad fake accent.Even when the two hook up with Karen Black and Toni Basil, things still remain dull, and the movie then hilariously goes into ""Magical Mystery Tour"" territory by trying to be all ""psychedelic"" due to a drug trip.Most people know the ending, but by then, it's really kind of unemotional, because did we really care about these characters anyway?Apparently, there were many scenes cut out of the film, and going by their description (they sounded like good scenes), it almost seems like there was an actual effort to make the film as boring as possible by taking the good scenes out.I do like the general idea - two pals going their own way and forging their own path hit the road and have adventures while on their ""search"" for whatever. I just wish it wasn't all so darn dull.",Easy Rider
113,nesfilmreviews,A hallmark of independent film making in American cinematic history.,9,25 May 2013,"""A man went looking for America, and couldn't find it anywhere..."" With a blistering rock-and-roll soundtrack, a host of trippy cinematic techniques, and dialogue that represented a very unique period in American history (""They're not scared of you. They're scared of what you represent to them.) ""Easy Rider"" from 1969 is a hallmark American film, and a great independent feature success. The ultimate counter-culture classic, ""Easy Rider"" directed by first time director Dennis Hopper, jolted a Hollywood in transition when it became an unexpected hit in 1969, encapsulating the freewheeling spirit of the times, and the divide between the youth culture and the Establishment. This unconventional classic, which Time magazine hails as ""one of the ten most important pictures of the decade,"" continues to strike a chord with audiences of all ages to this day. After securing a major drug deal in Los Angeles, two free-spirited potheads Billy (Dennis Hopper) and Wyatt, a.k.a. Captain America (Peter Fonda), buy choppers and hit the road, traveling from Los Angeles to Mardi Gras in New Orleans to experience ""the real America."" Along the way, they encounter rednecks, experiment with LSD, visit a hippie commune, end up in jail, all in the name of living the American dream. While inevitably dated, it remains worthwhile, highlighted by Laszlo Kovacs photography, a great soundtrack, and Jack Nicholson star-making performance as a boozed up lawyer who tags along for the ride. Nicholson earned a Best Supporting Actor nod, while Hopper and Fonda continued to solidify their reputations. ""Easy Rider"" was the official U.S. entry at the 1969 Cannes Film Festival, where it won the Best Film by a New Director prize (Hopper). Opened across the country in September 1969, it mesmerized critics with its perspective look at America. The film also received two Oscar nominations-Best Original Screenplay and Best Supporting Actor (Nicholson). Highly influential in its camera-work, storyline, and 60's rock soundtrack--""Easy Rider"" endures as the ultimate psychedelic road-trip.",Easy Rider
114,quaseprovisorio,this is an experience. a trip. a way of life. and a revolution. it won't be for all tastes but a lot of folks will love it.,10,16 June 2020,"What to say after watching this, besides saying that in the first minute i was already hooked with this movie: What is easy rider, well besides being the cultural phenomena we all know, even if it sometimes it's only aesthetical? easy rider is about so many things done in such a small length that's absolutey amazing. Yes it's freedom. of thought. of expression. of life. of love companion and filming. but it's also about america, about what was america back in those days and in a way about how the world is still now.how western societies are a way to put everyone as shepperds for money, because that's how we survive. even our heroes are on it for the money, even though we do know they're not eager for it: which is ultimately the biggest sin in the eyes of others. big hair, clothes, motorbikes, joints are just ways of expression towards having an attitude that collides with the life everyone is ""supposed"" to have. and this is also shown in an expositive almost naive way that sensitizes me. they're supposed to want money and to want to become rich, like the others. They kinda don't. and that changes everything. One of them is captain america but they don't want to be heroes. and and become heroes because they reject it.at the same time freedom is not to be stuck. neither in a life you don't want or a place without no more connection. is this movie positive about hippies? maybe in a way. maybe not totally. this is a journey these characters make against the american dream which tends to go west. and they're not portraits for that. but at the same time they embody everyone that doesn't see himself on the mainstream. even the movies.this movie works in a sensorial way: it doesn't have exactly a big plot or it follow a certain logic... it's a road, drug, sensorial trip with memorable characters such as Wyatt, Billy and George (nicholson steals every scene he's in, amazing actor as we all know). because...they represent themselves. they represent a middle finger to any system imaginable. they say what they want. they're kevin smith clerks (and i love that movie). they're the good and the bad boys that girls like. and hey, this is an indie movie. it works as a big videoclip throughout america, as a long dream, as a tale, as a simple story of following your dreams even if they're just the road, friends, motorbikes and drugs.without seeming to try, easy rider makes big statements about a culture, a society, a time, an era and a wish of change, of acceptance and love. without it i don't know where were indie movies. buddy movies. road movies. stoner movies. this is so many things in one and at the same time is so brilliantly condensed i have very few words. Just that i loved is and i i understand the hate. this is the type of film that can be divisive very much. but i loved every second of it. it's an intense experience that it will stay with me. i'll get here again one of these days to see a piece of history that is more than a film. as a film is imperfectly perfect. as history, well is part of it.",Easy Rider

It is about hippies and how and why they are like they are, and how they were treated by most of the world, they were the homosexuals of yesterday kinda like the blacks a hundred years ago, and the reasons for hating them is just as unjustified as is the reason to hate the other two. The story and screenplay are great and really show how everything was than. The acting is amazing its hard to think of a standout between the big three. The direction is amazing, one of the best directorial jobs ever and for sure the best debut. The visual effects are very good, amazing for the time.

116,Scott_Mercer,Nothing Left To Lose,10,5 March 2007,"""Freedom's Just Another Word For Nothing Left To Lose,"" wrote Kris Kristofferson (and sang Janis Joplin) in his famous plaint ""Me and Bobby McGee,"" a song which fits the ethos of this film perfectly.What were Hopper and Fonda trying to say with this film? I don't think we can reliably know their intentions at this late stage of the game. While both Hopper and Fonda are still with us (though co-writer Terry Southern is not), so much time has gone by, and so many drugs have been consumed, that perhaps the crystalline purity of their original artistic vision has been, let us say, diluted, to at least some extent, I'm sure you'll agree.My view is that a lot of the good that ended up happening in this film was a result of pure serendipity and luck. Am I saying that Fonda and Hopper have no talent? No way. But here are some facts: FACT: Hopper, Fonda and Nicholson were actually smoking pot in the film where they are shown smoking pot. FACT: there was no script for the film, only a short outline. FACT: Much of the dialog was improvised. FACT: Much of the cinematography was improvised. FACT: Probably the most important scene in the film, the final campfire scene, was made up on the spot.When you're walking a creative tightrope like that, the odds are good that you'll end up with garbage. Fortunately for them (and for us, the viewers), it didn't turn out that way. They ended up creating the ultimate commentary on America, both in the 1960's, and, in a certain way, for all times.What this film says is that the Sixties Generation was a fraud. They said they would be different. They said at their beginning that they were throwing out all the trappings and evils of our modern society, going back to the land, doing something honest, pursuing freedom.But, after all, they didn't reject society. They were just as greedy and selfish as everyone else, in spite of their protestations to the contrary.Another famous film line comes into my mind: ""I coulda been somebody, I coulda been a contender."" The Sixties generation could have done something important. But, according to Fonda's character, ""We blew it."" He and Hopper's character stand in for the entire counterculture. Wyatt and Billy go out into the world on their quest, and prove themselves to be just as greedy and materialistic as the mainstream society they reject. Fonda throws away his watch, but he also goes out and buys some ""dream machine"" and a silly leather costume, indulging in his own version of materialism: hot bikes, good drugs and the open road, with an occasional hooker on the side.The dangers of freedom: you're chasing after something that doesn't even exist. And this chase caused their downfall, (and the counterculture they represent) sending them to their doom just as clearly as those prejudiced Rednecks they encountered on their journey. A journey to the dark side of the American dream.",Easy Rider

This movie (9 out of 10) hit a nerve and not because IT discovered Jack Nicholson OR Peter Fonda and Dennis Hopper were rebels in Hollywood (WHICH THEY WERE), but for the simple fact that they lucked out having this low (relatively)- budget film ACTUALLY make money at that particular time.I don't think I've met anyone under the age of 30 (now) who hasn't seen or at least heard of this BIKER flick.  Sabrina Scharf (the woman at the commune who Hopper hits on) who was also in the best low-budget BIKER film (also with Nicholson) - HELL'S ANGELS ON WHEELS, who later became a Congresswoman or something is totally cool (the most believable in the commune AND none of THOSE folks are Manson-like (even in demeanor) except for that knife Wyatt picks up after Luke Askew (great Dude) takes them home. Anyway, this film is cool in the first 10 minutes even after Phil Spector BUYS his stuff and the CREDITS haven't even started.  Plus, all that crummy music - The Byrds, Steppenwolf, etc..  It's a time capsule (not for these actors' careers, but for American hope - even if you're against these guys). Anybody who doesn't appreciate this film probablly just hates Dennis Hopper and his life and outlook since the James Dean years.Come on, some of these people are DEAD now, and they weren't getting paid what Tom Cruise's stand-in donut-fetcher gets career wise.  I know this movie seems like an OLD movie to anyone under 40, but it's not!  Plus, Karen Black (great weird actess) and the gorgeous Toni Basil (FIVE EASY PIECES) and then later ""famous"" choreographer (MICKEY) and whatever ""frying"" in New Orleans, plus the cinematography by Laszlo Kovacs and great editing and having deadbeats at the Oscars like J. wayne and B. Hope make fun of this MOVIE AND MIDNIGHT COWBOY (which won Best Picture with an X-rating ..until it won) at the time.  I'll bet you 40% of Americans over 40 (who are still living) haven't even SEEN this film.  I don't know what else to say.  Judge for yourself!",Easy Rider
119,karl_consiglio,Cooler than cool,10,24 December 2006,"This is cooler than cool, this is it. From beginning to end, this film is one tight masterpiece, the shots, the music, the plot, the acting. Two men go in search of America on their hot bikes, they got it all organized but they never really quite find it. I mean they find many Americas but no real source of the love in which that generation believed except when they stop for a while at a hippie community where I believe they should have settled at least for a while longer, because that place was made for them, although they did not have much to offer except for the simple things in life and a whole lot of hope. After that it was all trouble in fact. I love the relationship between Fonda's character and that of Dennis Hopper, because they are not quite the same but get on like bread and butter, one guy is like an almost Christ like figure, a very good looking cat, and the other is a daft and clumsy looking fellow, more dog-like. Jack Nickolson is as wacky as he can get here and still very young, he is great. Check it out, its a trip......Literally!!!!",Easy Rider
120,JaydoDre,A convoluted message....,6,26 November 2014,"Easy Rider is trying to send messages. It is a movie showing a road trip of two bikers to Mardi Gras, but that is not what the movie is about. The question is, how much of what it is about will you actually understand or care about? The movie does this thing a number of times where instead of a simple cut between scenes you get a transition where the new scene is flashing its way into the old one. Such a transition invokes drama or shock, but here the scenes do not seem to call for it.There is a scene from first-person perspective of holding a knife against the background of a woman standing with her back turned. In some context it would have been pretty obvious, but this was not in any relatable context. So what the heck, man, Dennis Hopper, the director and writer of this thing, what the heck? I see it trying to comment on the contemporary American culture and various layers of people and changing times, and sometimes the message is clear but other times I do not know if I see what I am supposed to see. Maybe I needed to have grown up in the 70s to see it more clearly.It feels like an avant-garde 70s modern art piece. No, I would not call it pretentious, there is definitely some interesting stuff here, but there is way more pushed into the film than it can handle.I just know there will be a lot of people either not saying anything about the movie because they are afraid of showing they do not understand a lot of it or people who will pretend to understand it and praise it for all their pride is worth.Whatever it is, Easy Rider is at least an interesting head trip. It has a good variety of colors and brightness. It has good actors, especially Jack Nicholson. It is captivating even if you do not fully get it or it is just too old and obsolete for you.",Easy Rider
121,BigJimNoFool,Death of the hippy dream,7,22 May 2020,"What starts out as a well intentioned road trip with a sense of the open road, countryside and freedom eventually winds it's way to a terrible nightmare just as the hippy dream of the mid 60s did with the onset of the next decade.The film is a mess but has a freewheelin quality that is enjoyable and it has aged well watching this for the first time today. However there are issues firstly with the awful editing and the jarring soundtrack choicesThe peformances and script, or lack there of, are not especially memorable except perhaps Jack Nicholson. Hopper is a mess and Fonda is just dull.Not quite the epic counter-culture film i was hoping for as i have read about for years but an interesting document of the time that is still enjoyable enough.",Easy Rider
122,MK_movie_reviews,Young Wild and Free,6,3 November 2021,"I knew the title ""Easy Rider"" but I have not got the chance to watch it until now so I picked this movie today. It was full of young spirits. Dennis Hopper was always cheerful and easygoing. Peter Fonda seemed missing something and feels so sad. That duo is legend forever... I didn't expect that outcome. I think the US is really different from stats by stats in 60's. The last scene was really shocking and never forget it.",Easy Rider
123,erwan_ticheler,Great liberal movie,8,6 April 2002,"Easy Rider is one of those American liberal movies and I like it a lot. The story is maybe a little empty, but that is not important. Important is the feeling. Just look at them motorcycles!Jack Nicholson is the highlight of the picture and therefore it is a pity that his role is that short.Peter Fonda's and Dennis Hopper's ""failure"" sequence at the fire is quite a shock.The ending, the death of Peter, Dennis and Jack by a bunch of very American Rednecks is very dark and very serious.In the end, a very good and very important late 60's movie about freedom. 9/10",Easy Rider
124,erwan_ticheler,Groovy movie,8,23 November 2002,"SPOILERS!Easy rider is a great hippy movie about 2 guys(Hopper and Fonda) who cruise from LA to New Orleans to be at the Mardi Gras. They drive on choppers,Fonda's bike is superb!On their way they meet all sorts of people,like a farmer and a group of Hippies. In a small town they meet George Hanson played by a brilliant(as always) Jack Nicholson. Hanson also wants to go to the Mardi Gras and so he jumps on the back of Fonda's bike with a Football helmet(""I got a beauty!""). In Redneck land Nicholson gets killed by a bunch of ""1960's Republicans"". In the end the same thing happens to our 2 bikers.What makes this movie so great is the fact that it isn't a cliche movie like a lot of those hippy movies. Another big plus is Jack Nicholson, although his role in the movie is pretty short. His alien monologue is very funny and his ""nick-nick"" all the time is even better. And then the soundtrack: in one word Brilliant. Songs like ""If six was nine"" and ""I wasn't born to follow"" are two diamonds of that period and ""Born to be wild"" is an all-time classic because of this movie. The scene in which we see Nicholson on the bike for the first time is backed up by ""If you want to be a bird"" and this song makes the scene even more hilarious. The same for the scene with the song ""Don't Bogart that joint"". On the soundtrack,which I own,there are also two Dylan songs but they are not sung by Bob himself because he didn't like the ending of the movie. The strangest part of the movie is the Mardi Gras/Graveyard scene in which we see Hopper,Fonda and two girls take LSD. This scene is an actual trip because all the drugs that were used in this movie where REALLY used. The scene is very chaotic but maybe because of that even more shocking and historical. The scene in which Fonda claims that both guys blew it is very emotional and unexpected.In the end,Easy Rider is a classic and should always be remembered as a movie about a very important period. 9/10",Easy Rider

For people whom have got it all more or less together, you may want to do something more meaningful, like take out the garbage.Dennis Hopper does his Fellini impression as he directs the likes of Peter Fonda, Luana Anders, Robert Walker, and Luke Askew, all of whom are a helluva lot better than Hopper. The best thing about this little 'exercise in bizarro' is the pop culture music of the day and some nice desert photography.Not so great; 'special' only to potheads and other members of the the arty pretentious crowd.",Easy Rider

You simply are not ready.If however, you'd like to see a masterful abstraction of the great American divide, predicted decades before is started to wreak havoc on the countries psyche, conjuring the same tensions and contradictions that ring true today, although many people are wilfully deaf to these realities, then you will watch this, and rewatch it again and again and everytime, I guarantee, if you have more then half a braincell capable of critical thought, not addicted to fast, meaningless shiny nonsense, you will learn a thing or two about the human condition.I could have just said that!

Perhaps because I myself did not experience the period grandeur this film represented when it was released in 1969. Perhaps because it is poorly written with no apparent plot or clear story.On one side, I really enjoyed the performances, in particular Jack's, who along with Marlon remains my favourite actor, but also Peter Fonda's. Also, the film had an excellent 'sign of the times' score with lots of quality and wit. And finally, the cinematography was decent, with nice locations and using natural lighting to create lense flare. On the other, I found it to be poorly directed, strangely edited, and with little emotional engagement - sadly, the more important qualities for making a good film.That's why the film did not work for me. It might have for the young generation in 1969 America. But to me, it was a flawed film by Hopper in shiny clothes worn by the cast.",Easy Rider
128,ThreeGuysOneMovie,Hippies! Choppers! America!,9,3 June 2012,"There are not too many movies that you can say explain the purpose of a generation. It takes an introspective mind to make a movie that can explain the cultural embodiment of why we do what we do and the principles behind our actions that give reason to our being. Easy Rider is a masterpiece that clarified reason within many of our parents' generation. Liberation and understanding formed the basis of this opus that, to this day, serves as a historical landmark in the film industry. It is hard to find a movie that serves as a voice for a generation and this is what makes Easy Rider such a treasure. I and my friends are products of the ""X Generation"" and if you want to read a book that explains the ""X Generation"", I would recommend ""Generation X"" by Douglas Copeland. As far as movies are concerned there aren't many films that I can say explain the sociological significance of ""Generation X"", which only, to me, proves that ""Easy Rider"" is an ambitious 60′s generation landmark film statement.I will only translate a brief film synopsis so as not to belittle the enormous significance of this film. ""Easy Rider""is a film about two ""hippies""( Peter Fonda and Dennis Hopper) traveling cross-country on their ""Choppers"" with the intention of discovering the ""American Dream"". Little do these two hippie bike riders realize that the ""American Dream"" is heavily tainted by the unfortunate realization that bigotry and ignorance are inescapable even within their own homeland.Keep an eye-out for a young Jack Nicholson who plays an amazing role as ""George Hanson"", a free-wheeling, southern politicians' son who is immune to the small-town politics that serve as his safety blanket.Do not miss this epic film that is designed by a mind expanding soundtrack including Roger McGuinn and an eye-opening cinematography by Laszlo Kovacs and Baird Bryan. The character acting by Peter Fonda, Dennis Hopper and Jack Nicholson alone is just gravy. I give this classic film a three out of three guys based on the cultural significance alone.check out our film site at 3guys1movie.com",Easy Rider
129,ini_ynti-22457,"What is Freedom, really?",7,7 October 2019,I have to admit that this movie was a bit flat. No real conflict until Jack Nicholson showed up. I began to understand the conflict. And the ending was a big surprise for me. How sad...,Easy Rider
130,roddekker,"Meet The ""Beavis & Butthead"" Of The Woodstock Generation",2,13 August 2015,"You wanna know something? And, I'll bet I'm right about this. Easy Rider (like Blade Runner, Taxi Driver, The Matrix, etc. etc.) is yet another one of those damn-blasted movies that nobody is allowed to dislike.And, especially, no one is allowed to voice their dislike of said-movie on a public forum like IMDb without the expectation of backlash from other reviewers who blindly love Easy Rider to pieces.Yep. I'll bet I'm right about that.Anyway - In my opinion, Easy Rider was nothing but pretentiously shallow, hippie drivel. This dead-end movie proved to me (what I've always suspected) that the stoned-out 60s was an era in pop culture history that, in reality, totally sucked, big-time.Easy Rider is the type of movie that I swear they were making up its asinine nonsense as they went along. And, I don't know about you, but, I, for one, find watching people getting stoned is about as thrilling as watching paint peel.And, speaking about Dennis Hopper - Not only was he strictly an amateur when it came to his directing abilities, but, as an actor, his character portrayal as Billy in Easy Rider, literally, made my skin crawl with complete revulsion.",Easy Rider
131,rcolgan,"""They're scared of what you represent to 'em""",9,26 July 2014,"When Dennis Hopper and Peter Fonda set out on their road trip to film Easy Rider their filming methods were somewhat unusual. Most of the trip they were high on drugs. The cast and crew were largely comprised of strangers and friends they had met along the way. They didn't even have a complete script, working on it along their travels. But when their journey finished they had made a masterpiece, taking a unique look on the biker style of life and the free loving style of the 60's.We follow the two riders on their journey to New Orleans both living the life they want to live. As free men without the restrictions of normal life. When it comes down to it, the film doesn't follow much of a plot. In fact the first 30 minutes of the film doesn't even have much dialogue. Instead of focusing on a single story it builds up their lifestyle by showing how they live a building up their characters by showing how their lives function and creating their life through various encounters along their travels. Through these encounters we get many perspectives on how different people in America viewed the biker lifestyle at that time. Be it the fear of the motel manager or the aggression of the townsfolk, everyone in this film had a view towards them. With the growing reputation of the likes of Hells Angels and hippie culture at the time, the image of the life of the bikers was a highly negative one. People like Billy and Wyatt were viewed as a menace to society, simply because they were thought of as damaging American society. The films key concept was to destroy this stereotype and show these people were living life the way they wanted to live it in a realistic manner. It showed us all about how bikers actually lived their lives. Both the good and the bad. It shows us the beautiful sights from the endless deserts to the cosy towns. But also shows us how difficult the life on these roads can be. We see the friends and acquaintances they meet on the way. But we also see the people who hate what they are for no other reason than being something different. It's this honesty of the life that makes the script so interesting when it was first released. It tackled the free love era of the 60s in a way that hadn't been seen before by creating a more truthful version of what life on the roads was like. The realism goes to the point where a significant amount of screen time is devoted to showing them riding across the landscapes. There's no dialogue in these scenes and just the soundtrack to give them company. Not only is this a realistic representation of how bikers live their life by showing these moments, but it also shows the beauty of their lifestyle. The music works well with the landscapes to demonstrate the freedom and beauty that makes their lives so appealing to begin with. Easy Rider is visually powerful, contains memorable performances and is probably one of the best films looking at the free love way of life that I've seen. The films representation of their way of life will not be one that all will agree with. As Nicholson says in the film, there are some who fear the style of living bikers like this represent. But to those who are open on the bikers perspectives, this is an incredible film, giving a different perspective on this way of life.",Easy Rider
132,Don-102,A Far Out Document of the late 60's Encapsulates Counter-Culture America.,9,20 January 2000,"Not many films have documented an era of American culture the way it must have really been. THE BEST YEARS OF OUR LIVES captured the reality of the post-war 1940's. TAXI DRIVER is a masterpiece of social distortion and paranoia exemplary of the 1970's. No film other than EASY RIDER captures the late 1960's as seen by the American counter-culture. Peter Fonda and Dennis Hopper's story of two men who go in search of America and 'freedom' is a bona fide sign of the times. I may not have been around at the time, but it is great to see a film portraying the long-haired, hippie attitude towards an America in turmoil in the form of a biker flick, circa 1969.EASY RIDER is an exploration of vast and desolate parts of the country. Of course, the stop at Mardi Gras is a necessity, but what Fonda and director Hopper are trying to tell us is that there was no 'freedom' as they saw it. The sprawling journey shows filmgoers the multiple frictions and shattered idealism of a generation in the midst of cultural change. Sex, drugs, and music were exploding socially and 1960's ideology may have come to an end in 1969, literally and figuratively speaking - much like it shockingly does in this film.Peter Fonda plays cool ""Captain America"", otherwise known as Wyatt, while Hopper is a paranoid prophet of the hippies as ""Billy the Kid"". The stunning DVD version of the film notes the importance of Laszlo Kovacs, the director of photography. Much of the film consists of Kovacs' simple shooting of the riders as they travel spiraling highways and bigoted backroads. It is some beautiful footage and essential to the trip. A major deal is made, much grass is smoked, and the film takes off from there. Their ultimate goal is never clearly defined, but Fonda's final comment to Hopper may sum it up for viewers. Did they find what America was supposed to be about? I guess not according to Fonda.There is a surreal experience at a commune the Kid and Wyatt stop at. These scenes are out of a Fellini film. One significant shot paints the commune with a 360 degree pan across the faces of the live-in hippies. The expressions on the faces all seem different, some grinning, others just zoned out. Kovac's amazing camera work (especially on the road with the bikes) along with a virtual who's who in rock music of the late 60's makes for a sometimes visceral filmgoing experience. The immortal 'Born to be Wild' blares over the opening title sequence and everyone from Hendrix to The Byrds are heard throughout. EASY RIDER also contains one of Jack Nicholson's 2 or 3 most memorable performances, even to this day. As drunken lawyer ""George Hanson"", he creates an amazingly funny and perfect counterpoint to Hopper and Fonda. He realizes what the general public can think of the ""long-hairs"" and puts himself in danger just by traveling with them. A bizarre notion of alien presence in the U.S. government is part of a hilarious conversation Nicholson and Hopper have over Whiskey and smoke. His scenes on Fonda's chopper with the golden football helmet are absolute, cinematic classics. Credit must be given to Fonda, Hopper, Nicholson, Kovacs, and Terry Southern for giving a new face to movie-making. They captured the era in a raw, jump cutting fashion. Maybe the hippies were not entirely right by trying to live off the land, or smoking dope all the time, but they may have been onto something.RATING: ***1/2",Easy Rider
133,Hawkensian,'Easy Rider' is more of an artifact than a film,6,2 December 2012,"'Easy Rider' is unquestionably important, it's a seminal film. It was a large contributing factor to the birth of an era of burgeoning talent and art that produced many of the greatest films ever made. Easy Rider is a transgressive, political film; few creations have been so lauded for capturing the zeitgeist.However, to a modern audience, I feel it's more of an artifact than a film. To be frank, I didn't particularly enjoy it. I didn't find it that interesting, it didn't resonate with me that much. One connection it made with me was how it almost shattered that romanticised idea of riding the highways of America. Well, it didn't shatter it, but it certainly shows the potential emptiness of the experience. I'd still love to drive around America, but I'd gladly ditch the spirituality for clean hotel rooms and nice corpulent plates of Americana. I'd also prefer a muscle car.So, given its legacy, 'Easy Rider' is a hard film to judge. It would be ignorant of me to totally trash it, but I do think it's overrated, and I wouldn't recommend it to casual viewers.www.hawkensian.com",Easy Rider

136,jbacks3,Head out on the highway...,3,18 June 2005,"I recently saw Easy Rider again after a 25 year gap. I'm afraid what stood out in my mind as THE defining movie of the late 1960's hasn't aged well. To be frank: on a technical level, the movie is horrible. The production values are lousy (I realize it was a low budget job at the time), the script is lame and the photography is, at best, so-so. The acting, aside from the breakout performance of Jack Nicholson, is horrendous... everyone is portrayed as a cliché (OK, so Phil Spector might be dead on, but he's likely playing himself). Easy Rider has a few things that will ensure it's iconic place in movie history: 1) a classic soundtrack 2) Jack Nicholson 3) the 2 principal actors are out shined--and out acted-- by their choppers. Unfortunately, these bright spots are wrapped up in a production that looks like a freshman film school final. A better use of your time is to dump the soundtrack into your iPod--- or if you see the movie, watch the first 5 minutes, skip to Jack Nicholson's all-too-brief appearance then skip to the final 30 seconds... you'll think it's great.

137,frankwhat,Typical 60's Movie!,6,5 December 2004,"Well I do have to say that the soundtrack was really good and fit into each scene perfectly. However I wasn't that crazy about the film itself because it was slow-paced, sad at times for no apparent reason, and this style of movie was copied all the way into the late 70's (i.e. - ""Midnight Cowboy"" which I hated as this was much better). I guess you had to be alive in this time period to understand the atmosphere because some of the different peoples' behavior seems extremely weird to us today. I also didn't like how characters would just be killed out of the blue and nothing was done about it. Don't get me wrong I usually can't stand hicks but I'm pretty sure that even they didn't go around murdering hippies with no motive. I thought Peter Fonda played the best role since he was very laid back and cool about everything. He seemed to be the brains out of the bunch and knew what real happiness meant to him; probably more so than most folks. I figure the quote 'we blew it,' refers to the fact that they could've found peace at a few places they passed by in the beginning and failed to notice but instead kept on going to locations that they wouldn't fit in at.

138,pzanardo,"Over-boring and silly. Beautiful photography, though.",3,29 November 2001,"I first saw ""Easy rider"" when I was eighteen, in the early 1970s. For all the influence the spirit of those years had on everybody, me included, I found the movie incredibly boring. Being a teenager, I just liked the motorbikes. I've seen again ""Easy rider"" few weeks ago, and again I was extremely bored. However, this time I greatly liked the wonderful photography. Really a great job by Lazslo Kovacs. I consider the beauty of the sceneries the only positive side of the film.Fonda, Hopper and occasional mates take drugs. After a while they re-take drugs. Shortly after, again drugs. And so on, and so on, and so on. What could be more excruciatingly boring? The scenes at the hippie community are unintentionally ridiculous. After their work in the fields, the guys find no better than to stage a... pantomime! I say, isn't it much better to be slaves of sinister capitalists than to swallow a pantomime every given night?The hippie life could be good for twenty-something people. At that age boys and girls are satisfied just staying together. But it is to be pointed out that the main actors were well into their thirties when the movie was made, and they showed it, Peter Fonda included, for all his beautiful looks. As a matter of fact, Hopper looked forty-five, perhaps due to the use of his beloved drugs.The film represents all American common people (and especially policemen, needless to say) as loathsome fascists devoted to beastly violence and gratuitous killings. It's typical of this sort of ideology to preach tolerance, showing the most brutal intolerance. I intend to be generous in judging Nicholson's final sermon on freedom and what else: it is just silly, as well as most lines of the script.""Easy rider"" is a forgettable movie which, unfortunately, will never be forgotten.",Easy Rider

141,Chuck-149,A bad movie,3,25 January 2000,"Peter Fonda is a terrific actor with plenty of talent.  The only problem is that he hasn't played in any great movie.  In fact, the only two movies I know he played in are ""Easy rider"" and ""Ulee's gold"".  Until I saw it, I thought ""Easy rider"" was a terrific movie.  However, now that I've seen it, I think the only good movie in which he played is ""Ulee's gold"".  As for ""Easy rider"", it's terrible.  It's very psychedelic and not at all well developed.  I know it was in the sixties and that psychedelic movies were everywhere at that time but believe me, if you want a good psychedelic movie, watch something like ""Midnight cowboy"" or at least something good. 
  Wyatt (Peter Fonda) and Billy (Dennis Hopper) are two best friends.  Both of them are motorcyclists and one day, they decide to go on a trip across America.  Along their way, they meet many people and give rides all over the place.  They also start off the movie by buying and then selling some drugs which look like cocaine.  The first ride they give is to a man who is going to join his group and they all live in tents, setting themselves aside from society.  There, Wyatt and Billy are invited to have dinner and when they leave, two of the women in the camp come with them to a river on the other side of the mountain.  After they all swim in the river, Wyatt and Billy take the women back to their camp and they continue their trip.  Now here's the best part of the movie.  On July 4th, they ride into a town where there is a big parade for independence day in the streets.  The two men start to ride with the parade and are eventually arrested.  In the city prison, they meet a man named George Hanson (Jack Nicholson in a terrific performance).  The next morning, the three men are let free and Wyatt and Billy ask George where he is going and decide to take him with them.  But one night, as they are sleeping in the forest, some men from the city sneak up on them and start beating on them with sticks and they kill George.  The next morning, Wyatt and Billy leave realizing there is nothing to do but leave George there and they eventually meet their own destiny.  Dennis Hopper directed this movie which is considered by many to be an American classic.  I still don't understand why since there isn't anything special about this movie except Jack Nicholson's performance.  Other than that, there isn't anything special.  The movie doesn't even really have any specific goal.  I know it's a psychedelic movie but I've seen some much better psychedelic movies which had a goal.  As for the script, well I can't really criticize it because there isn't enough dialogue to give an opinion on it.  I don't recommend it.  See it only if you like motorcycles and nice scenery.",Easy Rider

It moves along at a fairly slow pace, allowing the characters and journey to dictate the mood. However, it is definitely a movie that all with an appreciation of cinema should see.

50 years after its release Easy Rider is still as relevant as ever. It's a powerful and uncompromising depiction of America's culture war that doesn't portend to have any good guys, much less answers, as it follows three guys (played by stars Fonda, Hopper, and Nicholson) who are biking cross country and engaged in the use and spread of drugs. But still, the divide is real. Just as real today as it is today. Free love, Individual liberty and maybe a little bit of decadence on one side-- bigotry, closed mindedness, and hatred on the other. I won't spoil what happens as it really should be seen. A really powerful film.",Easy Rider
144,latsblaster,Join the ride,8,13 June 2003,"I didn't know what to expect before seeing ""Easy Rider"". I saw it on a cinema, and I would recommend everyone to do that. I don't think you can like it as much if you haven't seen it on the big screen with the best sound. The music is often excellent in ""Easy Rider"". The camera-movement and editing is according to me not slow, it is done with feeling and emotion.
Some people think this is a slow movie, but that is not the same thing as a bad movie. ""Easy Rider"" keeps my concentration and attention through the whole movie, without any problems. The narration in ""Easy Rider"" doesn't remind much of other famous American movies, but it still has the ability to catch you. I don't think this is a movie of nothing. ""Easy Rider"" has booth narration, plot and story.
The acting is close to superb. Peter Fonda and Dennis Hopper are great, and Jack Nicholsen makes an outstanding performance. Don't judge ""Easy Rider"" before you have seen it. Rating: 8 of 10.",Easy Rider

I can give credibility to the voyeur film style and the fact that it gives witness to a time period I will never know. But it's a pop-culture piece from the '60s. It's like that raver movie ""Go"", but for the hippie era.The characters in this movie are pretty dry and unlikable if you ask me. I guess young liberals at the time were supposed to identify with the protagonists? Two free spirits (Peter Fonda/Dennis Hopper) road-trip across the country on their chopper motorcycles, going through hippie communes, small towns, hick-infested backwoods towns and New Orleans -- all while doing a plethora of drugs.

Ad-libbing in front of a camera while stoned for an hour and a half should and could be done so much better. The acting is poor, the cinematography is garbage and the plot is non-existent. The only somewhat entertaining portion of the movie is when Jack Nicholson's character shows up -- at least he has a personality and some interesting things to say -- but he has 15 minutes of screen time and then we're left with Fonda's mannequin impression and Hopper's annoying dirt-bag schtick for the remainder of the film. Even worse, if you eliminated all the scenes of the main characters riding motorcycles set to music the movie might be 1/2 an hour at best. I can't believe this was critically lauded AND nominated for 2 Oscars. My favourite part was the end scene -- both because the movie was over and because I very much wanted to do the same. Maybe I needed to be stoned immaculate to enjoy this.",Easy Rider

148,Primtime,Deeper than most would expect,7,6 February 1999,"Easy Rider is a film that a lot of people have a hard time enjoying and a hard time explaining. I had seen this film three years ago and couldn't make much sense of what I had just seen. However, having recently watching this film again, I enjoyed it and fully understood the message of freedom and the lack of it during the '60's in the U.S.The story revolves around two long-haired hippies Wyatt (Peter Fonda) and Billy (Dennis Hopper) who make a successful drug deal that leaves them with a lot of money and a lot of time on their hand to do whatever they please. They decide to cross the country in a effort to get to Mardi Gras in New Orleans, meanwhile enjoying the trip to get there. Along the way, they come across a rancher and his family and another hippie who is trying to find a way back to a commune. Wyatt and Billy take the hippie to the commune and end up staying there for a short time. The conditions at the commune are below poverty and show just the adverse side of the whole ""flower power"" and ""free love"" movements that endured throughout the sixties. Eventually they Wyatt and Billy are thrown in jail upon where they meet George Hanson (Jack Nicholson) who tells them of the greatest whorehouse that awaits him in Louisiana. George is convinced he must go, so Wyatt and Billy agree to take him with them for the remainder of the journey.The rest of the film must be seen and I won't give any of it away other than saying that there is a very abrupt ending. Nicholson gives the best performance of this film and is just as likeable as the two main characters. There are some interesting scenes in this film (especially when Hanson lights up a joint with Wyatt and Billy) although there is hardly any dialogue in this film, rather relying on visuals and the underlying message of the film to speak to the audience. This film shows the thoughtlessness of some Americans during this period and should be seen by all to open some minds that are lost to conformist opinions and stereotypical beliefs. 7/10 stars.",Easy Rider

150,cadfile,The cinematic equivalent to a Saturday Night Live sketch,5,18 January 2005,"Easy Rider is one of those films that people think are cool even if they've never seen it or think it is cool for reasons that have nothing to do with the film itself - like the plot. It is more like a sketch on Saturday Night Live - a good setup looking for an ending.This film is more a character study than a film as we know them today. You have Wyatt and Billy played by Peter Fonda and Dennis Hopper. Then you have the counterculture played by the members of the commune early in the film. Then you have the red necks who hate anyone different and will resort to violence to get people to conform. Finally you have Jack Nicholson who plays George Hanson. Hanson represents mainstream America who want to be hippies.How these characters interact for 95 minutes gives us the film.Wyatt and Billy are about selling and smoking dope and going where ever they want to go and doing what ever they want. They are individualists. They visit the commune and while they have some good times they leave because it is too constricting. Billy makes the comment at the gas station that he doesn't trust the commune guy who they give a ride too. He doesn't trust him because he is afraid he will find their money from the drug sale.Next they meet George Hanson. Hanson is intrigued by Wyatt and Billy. He would like to be like them and joins them on their travel.The group stops at a diner to eat and have a run in with some red necks. The men make snide remarks and the travelers are refused service just because of what they look like. There are some teen girls who go gaga over the travelers and that seems to set off the red necks. Late that night they attack the group while they sleep. George gets the worse of it. Wyatt and Billy aren't sure what to do with George but Billy goes through his wallet and takes what cash there was.They get to Louisiana finally and meet up with two girls, Mary, played by Toni Basil of ""Hey Micky"" fame, and Karen, played by Karen Black. The group trips out on acid in a weird scene set in a cemetery. Then the two men continue their journey.On the road they have another run in with red necks and the movie ends with a twist.While the film does a good job for most of the run, the ending seemed tacked on even with the twist. I just sat there and thought ""What's the point?"" As a sample of the culture in the late 60's, Easy Rider deserves praise but the lack of an ending was disappointing.

Truly sacrilegious.The film's climax is totally bogus. There's no way those rednecks gave our boys a soft beating while killing George Hanson. Sorry, that dog won't hunt.I take from the film that drugs left Capt America & Billy useless to defend themselves.Finally, not one Dead song? Definitely a film worth seeing. Been like 20 years since I saw it.

But to quote Brad Dexter's character in ""The Magnificent Seven""; ""sure, sure, that's all on top. But what's underneath?"" The answer: Nothing. POSSIBLE SPOILER Two scum bag drug smugglers, who deal dope because they're too lazy to work and have no regard for the pain and suffering their enterprise causes, get a big payoff from a crime boss and spend the next few days/weeks/months biking across the great Southwestern Desert of America and meander their way to New Orleans. One of these clowns even has the audacity to drape himself and his chopper in the Stars & Stripes motif. All this while thousands of upstanding young men were fighting and dying in Vietnam to defend the rights of these two ancestors of Beavis & Butthead.And since America isn't beautiful enough by itself, they enhance their metaphysical surroundings by constantly toking joints all along the way. Hope they don't crash into any school buses or other ""regular citizens"" who might trespass on their private DUI highways. Pete and Repete mooch off hippie communes or sit in road side cafés, bewildered because the locals are disgusted by what they are, scum bag drug smugglers. Their ""holier than thou"" attitudes eventually get them what most arrogant bad guys deserve.

154,n_r_koch,Hopper goes with the flow,6,15 January 2007,"Though the heroes are bikers, ""Easy Rider"" is a bit like the fantasy of a very earnest, stressed-out Harvard freshman with family problems. Critics who raved about it back in 1969 needed to have their heads examined. What with all the LSD, some of them eventually did.Dennis Hopper was no dope, though. This film earned 100 times its cost; it was commercially as shrewd as a Coca-Cola ad. Just as intended, it had young audiences shouting ""Right on!"" at the screen and paying to see it again. They were the same people who shouted ""Right on!"" at ""The Graduate"" and paid to see it again. Back in the day, their grandparents paid to see Erich Von Stroeheim, the Evil Hun, again so they could shout at him too. Their kids just paid to see the equally commercial, manipulative ""American Beauty"" over and over again-- and then threw a pile of awards at it. Some people never learn. Hopper's film was commercially shrewd in another way: it attacked ordinary Southern whites, America's Bad Guys in 1969 (before everyone needed their Electoral Votes) in the crudest, most lamebrained possible fashion. This film is still worth seeing, though, if only to see what the fuss was about. The Western panoramas look great and the music is good. Hopper has his usual wacky charm. And Jack Nicholson, the comic relief, takes over the movie while he's in it.",Easy Rider
155,CheshireCatsGrin,Counterculture classic,8,29 October 2009,"I haven't seen this film in several years. Although it was released the year I was born, I still enjoy it. With the odd, almost clean-cut Captain America and more anti-social Billy the audience travels across the country on their motorcycles showing America through the intoxicated eyes of both of them.Jack Nicholson shines. As a ""square"" he soon shows that for all the differences people are the same (the way he reaches for his flask just as naturally as the counter-culture reached for their joints).This movie opened the door for directors to take quite a bit of power away from the producers in the industry. The importance of Easy Rider is documented in the book and documentary ""Easy Rider, Raging Bulls"" as well as ""Outrageous Conduct: Art, Ego and the Twilight Zone Case"". In fact, it was the second book that brought me back to watch Easy Rider. I wanted to see the importance of this influence in the late 70's and early 80's Hollywood.Back to the film, it comes from the same time period as Midnight Cowboy. If you didn't like this film there is a good chance you won't enjoy Easy Rider.It is not a story as much as a story of the character's current situation. Not their life before, nor their influence on others, or even a resemblance of a plot driven movie. It's what a call a ""Film Film""...that is a film that is just that, a film.

156,tobydale,It is what it looks like,8,27 October 2020,"By now Easy Rider is a totem for the free-livin' hippy culture of the late 1960's. A time capsule - if you will.I grew up in the UK in the 1960's & 70's and Easy Rider was always a film I wanted to see as it had rapidly gained cult status. Rated ""X"" - or 18 by todays standards I had to wait until 1976 before they would let me into the cinema!In the 44 years since I first saw it nothing has really changed. WIth some films you watch and then 20 years or more later you watch again and you think, ""phew that wasn't how I remember it"". Not so with Easy Rider. Even though I am now in my 60's I see this film exactly the same way I did when I was 18. Why is this?Easy Rider speaks to the counter-cultural in me. I grew up believing that if I didn't want to conform then if I wouldn't have to. Except.... In my life I did conform (schoolteacher, now retired). We kinda have to conform - but I still believe in the counter-culture!When you watch Easy Rider - whether the first viewing or the 10th - you are struck by how Captain America (Fonda), Billy (Hopper), and indeed Hanson (Nicholson) all express admiration for what they see as the ""American Dream"". In their own ways they are each products of it - but in their own ways each one is trying to break out. A key aspect of the American Dream is growing up with and nurturing the desire to ""live free"". The Hendrix track chosen; ""If 6 was 9"" speaks perfectly to this. Now here's the thing; they all want to live free - the hippies in the commune, the central characters, even the vile locals in the Louisiana roadhouse - but they can't. Why? Easy Rider is a kind of exploration of why they can't and what happens because they can't.It's a classic roadtrip movie. Great cinematography and some classic situations. No unneccessary dialogue - indeed - the two ""heroes"" (anti-heroes) aren't seen to gel or come together during the piece. The story mostly moves along because of the input of the Nicholson character.The soundtrack is excellent and makes the film what it is. In the ""making of"" video in the Extras on the disc we learn that Crosby, Stills and Nash were asked to write the soundtrack. Surprise! However, they watched the film with the existing songs and declared that they were blown away and could not improve on them. Bigger surprise!Overall - Easy Rider is what it looks like; 2 stoners who like motor bike roadtrips have made a film about 2 stoners on a motor bike road trip. It's quite straightforward.Born to be Wild? Hell yeah!",Easy Rider
157,bellabanana93,Funny,7,17 October 2017,"Easy Rider (1969) is an Adventure/Drama film about two counter-culture hippie bikers travelling from Los Angelos to New Orleans in search of America starring Peter Fonda as Wyatt and Dennis Hopper as Billy. I found this film to be entertaining and mostly because it had so many downright hilarious moments. One of the best actors in Easy Rider is definitely Dennis Hopper. He portrayed his character in his authentic and hilarious manner. I did find that the songs went on for a really long time and did not really add much to the plot, though they were enjoyable songs which went along well with the theme and showed the two men on their travels. The movie was great throughout, but I found that the last 30 minutes were the most enjoyable and really conveyed what the movie was meant to be. Overall, Easy Rider is a great film about motorcycles, sex, and drugs for adults to enjoy.",Easy Rider
158,silva-w-pius,A bitter sweet symphony,7,25 December 2013,"It would be harder to find a film that was more quintessential to a particular decade than Easy rider was to the 60's. Dennis Hopper ingeniously captures every last ounce of essence of a decade going through so much change, as well as acting as the encapsulating of the zeitgeist of a decade consisting of music greats as the Beatles, Jimi Hendrix and the Byrds - just to name a few. Hippies counter culture and the infamous Woodstock, as well as raising racial conflict in the wake of the civil rights movements. Upon the success of a drugs deal, two motorcyclists Wyatt (Peter Fonda) and Billy (Dennis Hopper) embark on an adventure to discover the real America on their way to New Orleans, but instead all they encounter is a dead friend at the hands of society that won't accept them because they are still stuck in its old ways, and is frankly terrified of a new world they don't understand and can't control. The only way I can truly describe this film is through the lyrics of the verse and their hit single bittersweet symphony. The bitter aspect comes from the fact that the good natured character had to experience so much turmoil. While the sweet is the essence of the hippie culture, which is all about peace and love and looking out for each other, then we have the symphony, Dennis Hopper demonstrates calm, assuredness and bravery for a man still in his directing infancy, but still yet has the ability to teach his elders a thing or two about honest work. For me Easy Rider was a film that was able to say and represent so much in a mere one and a half hours, that takes directors a whole career even to attempt to manage, and thus it was a film I really enjoyed.",Easy Rider

Why would anyone have funded this, especially the fact that Dennis Hopper was the director? Some of the worst acting I have seen in a while, especially the Dennis Hopper character, who was a bad caricature of a hippie of the day. I can't believe the IMDb community rated this so highly! Well, I received the ""must be 10 lines"" message, so I'll add that perhaps the best acting was done by the members of the hippie commune; they were actually believable.",Easy Rider

This is one of the best movies I've ever seen because it addresses issues that we still struggle with today and it shows America's natural beauty and human ugliness. It's social commentary and I was not expecting it to be so insightful. Sure, there are stoner moment and trips and hippies, but that was part of the 60's and everything is shown for what it is instead of it all being romanticized.A character in the movie says something that is very much true today: people say they want freedom but they're scared of it when they see it.

It's a bunch of badly edited shots of driving across country on bikes set to music. I read that they made it up as they went along, and it shows. The actors wrote their characters as cool, tragic, rebels that have to turn down beautiful young women. Maybe if I had more experience with psychedelic drugs I could've appreciated it more but since I haven't it was just annoying, boring, pretentious, hateful, self-indulgent, dated and preachy. The ending is completely ludicrous. These drug abusing criminals are portrayed as heroes, while conservatives are portrayed as evil murderers.

162,markmuhl,The price of freedom,9,2 June 2017,"Expectations are high when watching a much acclaimed cult movie for the first time, maybe too high for an immediate love affair but it does not take very long to sense the special atmosphere of this artwork.At first sight, it is the mixture of a fabulous soundtrack, the beautiful landscapes of a road movie and the coolness of the two protagonists, which stand out. In my eyes, however, it seems to be quite a risky thing to have two drug dealers as the popular figures of a movie. Is it possible to identify with their search for freedom if this freedom is bought at the cost of harming others? Or is this meant to be already the first indication that the trip will have no good ending!Then there is the moral aspect of the movie, which is perfectly analyzed by the great side character given by Jack Nicholson: People are afraid of too much freedom and it makes them dangerous towards its representatives. How dangerous becomes clear already in the very same night that these words are spoken out and at the uncompromising end of the movie. The performance of Jack NickNick Nicholson is really striking and it appears to be only logical that this was the starting point of a great career.The film is also special because of some unusual shots, like the drug-selling scene just underneath the flight path to LA airport or the drug money hiding in the tank scene. I also appreciate the quick and bewildering cuts of the New Orleans LSD trip. I could imagine that this is a good cinematic approach to a real LSD experience (though probably not) and builds a nice contrast to the otherwise slow pace of the movie, which in some comments is even described as having no plot at all. This may be a bit exaggerated but it is true that the movie is mostly a sequence of little connected encounters along Fonda's and Hopper's road trip from LA to Mardi Gras, including the rather elaborate portrait of a hippie commune in the middle of nowhere. This may be also a reason for not falling in love with the movie immediately but in the end it is the sum of all these occurrences, which result in a well-balanced overall picture of the portrayed society in its time.",Easy Rider

I'd rather take a whipping than sit through this again.Although the storytelling goes to some length to make it appear that everybody but the lead characters (i.e. the squares and the establishment) are somehow stupid and beneath contempt and impossible to understand, it is in fact the story's heroes that are unrepentant sods. The movie drags like a lead anchor, that monkey business about dropping acid in the cemetery was an exercise in pointless ugliness, and while I was certainly ""with it"" in 1969, I didn't get this hateful movie then and I don't get it now.Perhaps I can best illustrate the value I place on this film by telling you I allowed my daughter to tape Xanadu over it.",Easy Rider

I think that is one of the films that combines too many elements and all fit perfect in the puzzle of his message, to start the music is undoubtedly a key element of the plot not only the use of rock songs but, in particular, every one of them, someone imagines the beginning of this movie without ""Born to be wild."" The same applies to photography and edition, the first showing the beautiful scenery of the south with its contrasts between urban and rural; the second, using jumps to beat the viewer to take him to travel the world of drugs or follow a travel by motorcycle in the middle of the desert. The story itself is nothing special, but it is all the episodes that the characters are going through what makes us realize the different ideologies of a country, the hippies and their world without rules facing decadent destination, racism and intolerance of a people towards expressions of young people who sealed the future of the protagonists and a denunciation of the time, so painful for a nation, performance by a explosion of a motorcycle with the flag of the country.

166,YellowManReanimated,A vision of the counter-culture,9,31 July 2021,"Perhaps no film better encapsulates the dramatic shift in American cinema during the '60s than this one: the entire film is shot on location; there are overt scenes of drug use and sex; the editing style is purposely attention grabbing, and none of the film's actors were major stars. It would simply not have been possible to have made and distributed a film such as this in Hollywood before this era, and, yet, once released, this film became an instant classic.The film's appeal comes from its unblinking desire to reach deep into the core of the alternative cultures of the '60s and to bring them directly to the fore. Characters are neither idealised nor demonised, rather they're portrayed as natural outsiders: communitarians, itinerants, dreamers, artists. They are people who mainstream society didn't cater for, who had the gumption to create a lifestyle more suiting to their nature.The two main characters, Wyatt and Billy, are on both a personal and a cultural journey: they want to make it to Mardi Gras, they want to experience a great celebration of life and community. On their way, they are met with prejudice, hate and suspicion. It's the strength of those negative forces, perhaps, which dooms the main characters' journey before it has even begun.Easy Rider is a comment on a generation of outsiders who ultimately were too small and too weak to be able to influence the monoculture around them. It's a comment on the '60s dream coming to an end and leaving behind it chaos, destruction and failure. ""We blew it"" says Wyatt to Billy, ""we blew it"" he repeats. I think he's talking about America and the West more generally: there was an opportunity to do things differently, to live a more harmonious, holistic life, but that opportunity was blown. The efforts made to bring it to pass would become mere history.",Easy Rider
167,willwoodmill,Perfect example of New Hollywood cinema,9,14 February 2016,"Easy Rider was one of the biggest surprises I ever had (the biggest being George Washington), it was not at all what I expected. I was expecting a cult comedy, somewhere along the lines of Airplane! or The Big Lebowski. One thing I was not expecting was the film to send me into a melancholic depression, with tears in my eyes. Easy Rider is a perfect example of ""New Hollywood"" Cinema, a movement that started in the mid 60s and typically focused on more taboo subject matters, and had much darker protagonists. Easy Rider meets both of these qualifications, as it is about two drug dealing, pot-head, biker, hippies, that after making a big drug deal in California, try to drive all the way to New Orleans in just a few days for Mardi Gras, while simultaneously trying to find the American Dream. As they meet different people and camp in old ruins. The film was co-written by its leads, Dennis Hooper, (who also directed it), and Peter Fonda. It was also produced by Bob Rafelson, who was a key figure in the New Hollywood movement, and stars another key figure, Jack Nicholson, who starred in several major New Hollywood films (Five Easy Pieces, Chinatown, One a Flew Over the Cuckoos Nest, etc). Jack Nicholson gives the best performance in the film, which is pretty impressive feat, because they're all great and noteworthy, and he doesn't come in until halfway through the film. Jack Nicholson plays the character of George Hanson, a drunk in a small town with some pretty crazy theories about the government. But before we meet George Hanson, our protagonists have already traveled with several other colorful individuals that bring their own philosophy. Some of the best scenes in Easy Rider, are the camp fire scenes, where after a long day of biking the characters will just sit down and talk for 3-5 minutes, before going to bed. And the conversations they have during these scenes are some of the best written dialogue I have ever heard in any film ever, I don't won't to spoil any of the conversations for anyone who hasn't seen the film, but when you get to these campfire scenes, get ready for pure gold. One thing that isn't so good in Easy Rider is a montage that happens towards the end of the film, the idea is fine by itself, but goes on so much longer than it needs to that it just comes of as forced, but that's a small thing in an otherwise great film. Easy Rider is one of those films that has huge potential to change someone's life, like Ikiru or The Graduate, something that just is filled with some many emotions, and lessons, something that sticks with you long after you've finished watching it, and gets better the more you think about, something that will not only forever change the way you look at cinema, but the way you look at life. 9.3/10",Easy Rider
168,pogostiks,"Like, man, you know, man...",4,15 September 2007,"I first saw this in 1969 and hated it violently; I swore that if Dennis Hopper said ""man"" one more time I was gonna walk out of the theatre. Fortunately, Jack Nicholson showed up and saved the film from total ruin. I guess what I disliked most about it was that it seemed to have been made without a script... and the ad libs were so lame for most of it that it bored me to tears. Now I read in the trivia section that they were mostly stoned and drunk for the filming... and ad-libbed their way through half of it - so I am vindicated.Now, almost 40 years later, I watched it again... and my basic feeling about it hasn't improved. The only character that the audience can care about is George...played by Jack Nicholson. He has charm, he has wit, his acting is creative enough that you KNOW that this man will go on to bigger and better things. He is the only saving grace in the entire film. Peter Fonda spends the entire movie looking ""cool""... and his pronouncements sound like pretentious crap. Dennis Hopper has to be one of the most over-rated actors ever created by Hollywood. In this film he comes across as an insensitive creep. It is no surprise that many of the people working on the film quit because of his drunken and paranoid rages. When he gets killed, it is -in my estimation - a mercy killing... The main mystery here is why so many people seem to have loved this film. I suspect that this is because everyone likes to feel like a bit of a rebel. It is almost yelled at you from the screen that the only people who can appreciate the ""heroes"" of this film are people ""in the know"", people who are cool, people who ""get it"". If you DON'T like the characters portrayed (or the film by extension...), it is subliminally suggested that you are a Neanderthal; so how many people are gonna stand up and say this is junk? Yes it has some good music, yes the landscapes are often majestic and beautiful, and yes, the scene where Nicholson talks about how the concept of freedom is a dangerous one to be bandied about is a nice insight. But is that enough? Maybe for a fifteen minute short...but as far as I am concerned, Easy Rider has always been a disappointment, and it doesn't look any better now that it did originally. Some films never lose their freshness, and can be seen again and again with pleasure. This film is done with such pretension that even one viewing of it is more than enough.",Easy Rider
169,Quag7,My favorite movie of all time...,10,22 January 1999,"Too often this film is relegated to retro documentaries and cheap nostalgia for an era too often reduced to its superficial artifacts (flower power, popular music).I was born in 1972, three years after this film was made, but the themes in it are still relevant and important to me.  Maybe I'm the last of a certain kind of American; someone wondering about what's still possible in the USA, and searching for the realized potential of the American Dream.  Perhaps what has changed since this film was released is that freedom - that is, real freedom, just doesn't matter as much to people as it once did. Self-enslavement is a popular past-time for today's numb middle class; a group of people who, I am convinced, do not dream when they sleep.This movie defined the road film genre, even though it was not the first of its kind.  I owe a debt of gratitude to Fonda, Nicholson, and Hopper for pointing out a very real truth about America and its often twisted approach to ""freedom.""  By any standard, this is a film which should not be missed. It is a film I wish I had written myself.",Easy Rider

171,Jill-68,An American Classic,9,20 February 2001,"Over time, this rough diamond of a film has become a real gem in my collection.  When I first saw it at the theater, I remember liking the anti-establishment attitude and the rock music soundtrack.  Later, on T.V., I remember thinking what a great actor Jack Nicholson was...and how terribly low-budget the rest of the film appeared.                          And now, over 30 years later....it's one of my favorite movies of all time. Peter Fonda tries to be Everyman....but he's really the most insecure individual of the group.  His cathartic trip at the cemetary in New Orleans is embarrassingly honest to watch.  His search is not for individual freedom...his search is for a family.  And yet, he is always the outsider, the observer.               Dennis Hopper is the sidekick, the fool.  And like a fool, he cannot hide his thoughts behind a socially acceptable demeanor.  He constantly says exactly what he thinks.  He has little patience for flower children, pretentious intellectuals, coy women, law officers, drunks in jail, or rednecks passing him on the road.  Like a fool, he is doomed.    Jack Nicholson is the core of the film.  He does not appear until halfway through the bikers' odyssey, but the trip will not make sense until his face rises up from the jailhouse cot to peer bleary-eyed at his surroundings.  He is the innocent man of this group....he is the AMERICAN.     This movie is just another road picture, the way ON THE ROAD by Kerouac was just another travel book.  This little counterculture movie is an American Classic.",Easy Rider
172,souther02,I never wanted to be like anybody else,9,15 November 2010,"Easy Rider is a fantastic movie. It has no personality. It is not spectacular, and is not so far removed from reality that the viewer knows absolutely that he or she is watching a movie. Movies made after 1980, but not all, abound so much in camera work and effects and video acuity that the dialogue becomes facsimile. Another very famous movie Hopper starred in is an example of reality in cinema that still becomes a realistic phantasmagoria in Southeast Asia. That, of course being Apocalypse Now. I don't watch horror so I cannot comment on Texas Chainsaw Massacre(but I might). Commentary is all this essay really is, yet much has been said and will continue to be said about Easy Rider. I say Easy Rider has no personality because the film is actually a documentary, in most ways. The footage of everything that goes on in this classic is the telling of a journey, and that is all. It's been called the essence of the 60's more times than the fans took something at Yasgur's farm. Everyone at Woodstock did not trip or get drunk, but those times were ending, the end of a decade. That jam was at the very end of the 1960's and Easy Rider was made at the very same time. Easy Rider was a Columbia movie, directed and produced by the two main actors in it. But why I say the movie was less a motion picture is that the actors were so, so natural. It was like a documentary, but from the inside instead of the outside. The screenplay does not serve to be entertaining, or to shock, or to cause the viewer to judge. The lines, the filming, all that just is. No point is being made. The commune is viewed by Hopper and Fonda(as director and producer) honestly and openly. The relationships between everyone who lived there are as if seen in a documentary with no narrative. It is not like watching a National Geographic show where the meerkats interact and play and then Hopper chops up the whole herd with a chain saw. Like a bushwhacker. No one at the commune in Easy Rider seems to be in a hurry, and it appears that they are living on and with the land. The story of Captain America and Billy is quite different. The commune is a stop along the way, and so is another less enchanting place where they meet Jack Nicholson. Billy is throughout the movie the type who believes in ""living for the minute"", and ironically Billy is a worrier, a whiner, and a complainer. Captain America is quite a different kind of person, a thinker, a planner, a guy with a clear head. Even though they are both criminals headed for a first hearing and beyond, Captain America is soft-spoken, thoughtful, and really considerate, especially on their first stop at a charitable farmer's place. As the two bikers continue their odyssey(the viewer's)Karen Black later enters the picture with her stirring and provocative eyes, and the movie begins taking on a more psychedelic quality at that point. A first rate blast from the past, Easy Rider clocks in at 95 minutes.",Easy Rider
173,paleolith,druggies don't represent my generation or era,6,3 June 2005,"Easy Rider is often held up as representative of an era and a generation. It's not. It's a drug movie. Just as the commune and cemetery and campfire scenes are clearly drug-induced, so is the paranoia; the horror-movie style of the café scene and the killings owe more to drugs than to ""the era"".Oh, yeah, drugs were around. Same today, not much difference. Yeah, prejudice was around, but outside of racial prejudice it rarely came to violence -- sometimes, but rarely. Yeah, there was some examination of ways of life, perhaps a bit more in that generation but hardly unique to it.Where have we heard about random highway murders, anyway? In LA = Los Angeles, not in LA = Louisiana.To me, reducing the three-hour version may have cut the wrong parts. The road trip is so disjointed that it doesn't make nearly the sense it could, but the murders make no sense outside of a drug-induced paranoiac state. If there was more road trip footage, I'd have liked to have seen it.I still give it 7/10 for the music, scenery, cinematography, and a few scenes -- the 360 pan at the commune evokes Andrey Rublyev. As for the rest, it's ""and this is your brain on drugs"" -- perhaps quite interesting, but should not be interpreted as anything more.And I'll second the recommendation of another reviewer that anyone who thinks Peter Fonda is wooden should watch Ulee's Gold. If Easy Rider led to Ulee, it was worth the cost of admission.Edward",Easy Rider
174,greg-e-porter,Easy Rider is a powerful movie that captures the American attitude and spirit in the late 1960's.,8,31 August 2015,"The premise of Easy Rider is rather quite basic; two friends, Wyatt (Fonda) and Billy (Hopper), ride their motorcycles from LA to Louisiana for Mardi Gras. Their drug fueled journey becomes a spiritual journey as the pair learns about themselves and America. The movie opens with the pair of guys parking cheap motorcycles outside a run down cantina. They are there to meet a cocaine dealer. The pair sample and approve of the powder. The camera cuts to the pair waiting near an airport runway. A Rolls-Royce rolls up and a well dressed man steps out. He, too, samples and approves of the powder before buying it for a large sum of money. The pair has made a fortune and plans to spend the money on a trip to Mardi Gras. They buy new motorcycles and set off into the desert roads.The acting in Easy Rider is solid. Dennis Hopper's performance as Billy is great. Initially, I labeled his character as ""hippy"": he has long hair and a bushy mustache and uses ""man"" as punctuation. At one point the two pick up a hitchhiker who is traveling back to a commune in the middle of the desert. The hitchhiker made me realize that there is a complexity to the characters that I missed. Billy is a hippy-like character in appearance but his temper and focus on worldly pleasures differentiate him from the others. Wyatt is a ""cool"" or relaxed type of guy and is the one that really grows through the journey. Unlike Billy or George or the hitchhiker, Wyatt is not a representative of a 1960's demographic. As George (Nicholson) explains, ""You are change and people don't like change.""As Easy Rider is something of a road trip movie, a common artifact is the super long, scenery shots. Denisoff and Romanowski note, the music played during these riding montages, forms a sort of ""musical commentary"". The soundtrack, beginning with ""The Pusher"" by Steppenwolf, continues with the iconic ""Born to be Wild"" also by Steppenwolf. You can see the progression of the story and tone throughout the rest of the soundtrack. Easy Rider is a perfect example of how music can be utilized to complement the images on the screen. Sure, we might have a great orchestration that provides emotional support but, here, the music provides a political (as well as emotional) support.Have you ever watched a movie where a particular scene is burned into your memory? Maybe it strikes a chord with you but as you see the shot you know that it is going to stick with you. I'd bet that it usually happens with scary movies. For example, you're in the shower and the Psycho shower scene flashes through your mind or if you are in a narrow, creepy hotel hallway, you might imagine The Shining's the twins. Easy Rider had one of those moments for me. Wyatt rolls the money they earned by selling cocaine into a rubber tube. He hides that rubber tube in his motorcycle's American flag painted, teardrop gas tank. It is a beautifully succinct yet complex statement about the US. One of the best parts is that the movie lets the image speak for itself.The cutting used at times in the movie is jarring. Instead of a Star Wars-like swipe cut or a fade to black transition, the movie alternates between the two scenes. We are watching scene A, then the movie cuts scene B but after a second cuts back to scene A. The movie alternates between the two scenes a couple times until resting on scene B. It is the type of cutting you might expect in an action movie. A character has a gun and points it at his or her target. The camera focuses on the gun, then the target, then the gun, 'bang,' then on the target. This rapid cutting is exciting so we are used to seeing it in an action but in Easy Rider the transitions between scenes aren't exciting. One jump, for example, takes us from the pair sitting around a campfire to Wyatt walking through a dilapidated Church. It felt jarring and don't quite know how to feel about it. I like the idea of using film techniques in unconventional ways but it feels awkward. Yeah, I can dig it. The idea that it is disruptive fits in with the rest of the movie which is socially disruptive.My only major qualm about the movie is that sometimes it moves away from visual messages to just sitting around a campfire telling us something. Consider the image of the gas tank and money. I know you can show some good stuff, movie, keep going; don't just regress into telling me something. This isn't a deal breaker by any means but it is noteworthy.If, for no other reason, to function as a time capsule, I recommend you see Easy Rider. It is clear depiction of a definitive time in American history. It also illustrates how film can resonate socially and politically. I think for a discussion post I will think about the responsibility of art, if there is such a thing. On a superficial level, or if you saw Easy Rider without actually watching it, it might appear like this film is glorifying a wayward and drug filled lifestyle. From what I hear, that's the message a majority of the original audience left with. In reality, Easy Rider is criticizing this lifestyle. If people misinterpreted its meaning, should it have been more overt?",Easy Rider
175,jd-116,A cautionary tale,2,23 June 2018,"This a morality tale about what happens to you if you're a hop-head bum with too much money. Though I very much doubt the producers saw it that way. There are things to like about this movie. The scenery, at least in the first half, is stunning. And some of the sound track (Steppenwolf, Hendrix) is good. In 1969 I was a freshman at Oxford, I thought it was crap back then. Inspired by Peter Fonda's recent remarks I just (June 2018) watched it again and (unsurprisingly) it's got no better. (Spoilers) Two layabout drug dealers (Fonda, Hopper) make a big score, then they buy a couple of motor bikes that look a bit more than they can handle, especially when under the influence of weed. Both the bikes stay implausibly clean, bright and shiny for the rest of the movie. From then on it's a road film, they pick up one bum and drop him off in a hippy commune. Cut to some skinny-dipping scenes. Then driving on, and finding themselves accidentally (probably too hopped up to notice) an unscheduled part of a town parade they get gaoled, but miraculously the cops are too stupid to find their stash of money or dope. In the hoosegow they meet the town drunk (Nicholson) and in the morning they set off together on their way to New Orleans. Stopping off at a diner, just the sight of them pisses off the local law (and as Barry Norman used to say ""And Why Not?""). They leave. Queue some portentous dialogue about advanced space aliens being in control. Being of no further use, the Nicholson character is conveniently bumped off by some hillbilly Trump supporters with baseball bats, our two heroes then bike on to Louisiana where they visit a brothel but are too stoned to get their rocks off. And finally (they probably couldn't think of another way to end this nonsense) Hopper flips the bird at a couple of confederate deplorables and understandably they blow his head off. Which is what I'd wanted to do from the first minute. They kill Fonda too in the final scene and I liked that even better. In fact I cheered. So by the end, it's a feel-good movie. Not as good as Death Wish but it has its moments.",Easy Rider

For what they had, they created a true art in cinema and I think if you are looking for a film that's plot is laid out simple and easy for you to understand, then you won't be a fan.

I have heard a lot of critism towards this film that I find a bit harsh. Sure, it's not the greatest film ever made, but it captures a brief moment in history almost perfectly, and that's more than most films can say.  I have watched this film with people who weren't alive in the sixties and people who were, and it is very obvious that those who weren't alive for it, don't understand it, and it's VERY difficult to describe and explain everything without very important things being ""lost in the translation"" as it were.  It can be perceived as a look back in time to a place that was beautiful and unique, or a bunch of burn-outs getting high, singing folk songs, and riding around with no particular destination and in no hurry. Either one is right. Basically, if you were not alive during the sixties but want to understand this film better, read some unbiased and thorough history books and Hunter S. Thompson novels, then try watching this again.",Easy Rider

179,riderpridethemovie,When recreational becomes vocational,5,15 June 2005,"Directed by Dennis Hopper. Now there are four words that you don't want to see in the opening credits. They evoke a feeling of helplessness, like the feeling I got driving with my grandfather in the latter stages of his life. He wore these wraparound sunglasses so you could never tell if he was looking at the road we often veered from; lanes did not apply. And when someone passed him he took it personally, cursing at them in his Scottish accent, then speeding up to catch them. He was like Mad Max for seniors. Come to think about it, a movie about good IL' Papa driving across the country in his New Yorker would make for an interesting movie. You know, man, about how America devalues its seniors. There could be a scene where Papa meets up with another senior at a diner and they pop their thyroid pills. Trippy. Yeah, and you could shoot the pill scenes in washed out 16mm, you know, to show how crazy the pills make them. And then at the end, some young punks who represent the youth that's always disrespecting their elders could drive Papa and his pal off the road. End of movie. I just checked and that plot took about eight minutes to think up. Which, since it is loosely based on Easy Rider, is about right. For all that it represents  rebellion, freedom, Peter Fonda's career  this movie is a stinker. Granted, Hopper, like my dearly departed Papa, does make it to the end without driving headfirst into oncoming traffic (barely), but the trip is so harrowing it hardly seems worth it. Take the characters (please). Hopper plays, well, Hopper, a drugged up ranting lunatic. This persona served him well, but in the service of other directors. But with his severe personality, it seems no one was willing to check his acting choices. The result is an intensely unlikeable character who, when he's not taking drugs or ranting, is pawing every girl he comes across. I guess sexual predators were just a part of the Summer of Love. Hopper's character might work if he was paired up with up a charismatic partner, but instead we get Fonda fils. Living up to the reputation of his father must have been difficult, but it might have been easier if he didn't choose the exact same vocation. Poor Pete just doesn't have much of a personality, certainly not enough to carry a plot less feature. So what we get is two losers travelling across the land, meeting other drugged-out, semi-literates. There are things to recommend about Easy Rider  Laszlo Kovacs is the real star of this picture; his cinematography is quite brilliant, especially his landscape shots. Fonda said he thought Easy Rider was like a western, but on bikes through John Ford's America, and while the comparison to Ford is ridiculous (Ford put more thought into one line than these clowns put into an entire movie), Kovacs captured the road beautifully. Another positive is Jack Nicholson, who doesn't arrive until 45 minutes into the film, does his best to save the picture, then gets bumped off. It's almost like the paranoid Hopper got rid of Nicholson before he could take over the movie. And what of the legendary ending? What does it represent? The end of an era? True freedom? The river that man built versus the river God built? I've always thought marijuana tends to dumb people down. It seems to turn off the switch that judges, so that everything is equally funny or interesting. It's almost like an attempt to revert to childhood, when cartoons and junk food were all you needed to have a good time. The script and the acting in Easy Rider were obviously fuelled my copious amounts of dope. And when it came time to end the thing, I think Hopper, Fonda et al. did what any kid would do  they blew it up.",Easy Rider

182,b-gallagher2,movie review,10,14 April 2011,"Easy Rider is AMAZING. Starring Dennis Hopper and Peter Fonda, featuring Jack Nicholson. This movie is incredible. Two free spirited hippies from the 60's voyage across the country on motorcycles. They score drugs, girls, booze and money. You can see how this movie could only be made after the hays code. Lazlo Kovacs the cinematographer gave it exceptionally astonishing visual photography. The shots, angles and composition look incredible. Especially in the scenes when Hopper and Fonda are followed as they ride their motorcycles off into the sunset somewhere in the country. This movie alone has some of the greatest cinematography in the history of film. Also during the scene when Hopper and Fonda drop LSD, the camera subjectively introduces us to a crazy acid trip. This movie also had an amazing soundtrack, Jimi Hendrix and many other bands. In the New Hollywood, they were able to start incorporating contemporary music into movies and with a movie about motorcycling badass hippies, of course the entire movie is going to have such a good soundtrack, especially for that time. But even today as well this music is still well appreciated. But regardless it helps create the mood and feeling of where and what is going on in the picture, Easy Rider.",Easy Rider
183,ChristophCinema,Get Your Motor Runnin',9,18 December 2012,"Easy Rider is another one of those movies that changed a lot in the late 60s. It's definitely a movie that's more of an experience, rather than a traditional story. It's basically a road trip movie, but it doesn't have the traditional three-act structure. It was very anti establishment, and must have been very shocking for the time. Making the main characters hippie bikers, showing nudity, and having people tripping out in a cemetery is pretty hard-core, but that's what makes this movie so great. It's one of those movies that needed to be made, and it brings up a lot of thought provoking things about freedom, the American Dream, and society. It's a movie that's fun to watch, but at the same time also very hard to watch. What keeps you watching are the characters. Peter Fonda, Dennis Hopper, and a very young Jack Nicholson are all amazing, and after a while, you feel like you're on the road with them. The film doesn't glorify the biker lifestyle, but it doesn't portray them as horrible people. The film isn't saying that this is how you should be; it's saying you should be whoever you want to be. One of my favorite quotes from the movie is, ""'All we represent to them, man, is somebody who needs a hair cut'. 'What you represent to them is freedom'"". And the ending is another one of those endings that's very unsettling, but it makes the message of the movie so much stronger, and leaves a bigger impact on the audience. Easy Rider is a great movie, and definitely one of the most necessary movies of all time. It's so different from any other movie that came out at the time, and just watching it makes you feel rebellious. I don't think it's a movie for everyone, but I think most people can get behind what this movie is saying.",Easy Rider

It does not represent America in 1969 nor does it represent the South of that time. It gives the worst stereotype of the South which is surprising, since the counterculture is supposed to be free of stereotypes.During his monologue about America, Nicholson's character says ""This used to be a hell of a good country"". Oh really? When was the USA better prior to 1969? Was it better in the segregation 1950's? Was it better in the 1930's when lynching was commonplace? Was it better during the Spanish Influenza of 1918 which killed more people than WWI? Was it better in 1900 when much of the country had no electricity, there were no child labor laws?

I did not really like this movie because I didn't understand what was happening at the end either with all the hallucinations. I don't know if thats because i don't do drugs or what haha but i couldn't figure this movie out, and the ending really made me think like, what was the point of this movie?",Easy Rider
189,Chrid-909,Why Easy Rider is great but flawed,9,6 June 2015,"Was reading some of the other reviews and have to agree with 'aliens_invade_us'. His review was the first that rang a bell with me and he presents the basic theme of the movie very perceptively and concisely.Let me throw in my sixpennyworth here: If you know something of the history of the making of this film it helps to understand it.When the film company looked at what Hopper had they freaked and said that no one would understand it and they forced him to cut the film down to 90 minutes.Now, the worst part: Hopper had shot A LOT more footage and this just got thrown in the garbage! Imagine, when the days of 'director's cut' came around Hopper could have restored footage and made a film of 100 or 110 minutes or whatever! Now, those people who moan that the film is 'slow-moving' and 'nothing happens' or that the cinematography is 'boring', well, they certainly wouldn't appreciate a longer movie! I guess they've been spoiled by the frenetic cutting of MTV and modern action films! But for us who love the way it's paced... it would be magic! Actually, you can many times SEE and HEAR where the forced cutting has been done because the soundtrack song is suddenly chopped off in the middle! Especially the Hendrix tune, if I remember rightly! I personally love the footage of the black homesteads passing by as the Hendrix song plays.But then, I sometimes love stuff that others find boring. That's why I love Widerberg's 'Love 65' where there are long lyrical scenes with 'nothing happening' and why I love Sandinista, the tripple album by the Clash, because it has loads of great music that would normally have been thrown out to make a 'polished' double or single album. Some people even moan that the Beatles White double should have been pared down to a single album! Conversely, I sometimes find stuff that other people find brilliant, to be contrived and boring, like that Eastwood movie that got so much praise and awards, you know, the one where he's supposed to have forgotten how to mount his horse!!! Well, thank God we all have different tastes and opinions! Another thing: Hopper had apparently originally intended that the two protagonists would have more of their own history explained: that they were both motorcycle stunt or circus riders, and other stuff...Anyway, even cut to 90 minutes Easy Rider is still a great movie with a fantastic soundtrack!",Easy Rider
190,jetan,Don't Believe the Hype,2,11 November 2007,"Trite. Pretentious. Shallow. Anyone who doesn't think this is dated will probably also dig the movies of Theda Bara. Bad performance (if you can call it that) by Peter Fonda, who appears to be maxed out on ludes. Jack Nicholson rescues his scenes, but since he only appears for a few minutes it ain't enough. Educators could use the script to hammer home the distinction between ""story"" vs. ""plot"".There are many better pictures from this period, thank God. Wild In The Streets and THX-1138 aren't really great flicks, but they hold up a lot better than this stiff. How do you make guns, sex and drugs boring? Watch Easy Rider and find out.",Easy Rider
191,bruscinoa833,Easy Rider,7,4 May 2010,"Easy Rider seems to epitomize the feelings and attitudes of the time period in which it was made, this is seen in both the acting and film-making. The way the film is shot is very gritty, the sets seemed mostly locations shoots in the deserts of the West and small town regions near New Orleans. The people that the two main characters run into seem to symbolize the different ideologies of the the time. At first the two run into a hippie hitchhiking and then into a town full of conservative and more closed minded individuals. For a good portion of the film body language and then use of eye contact is used between the main characters and other characters but it effectively gets its point across. Wyatt, played by Peter Fonda, is the more thoughtful and philosophical of the two and there are many shots of him deep in thought. While Billy, played by Dennis Hopper is the goofier one, added comic relief at times. Many of the scenes in the film are quite shocking, the scene where the townspeople come and bludgeon Jack Nicholson's character to death was a bit disturbing but comes in third to the drawn out psychedelic drug use scene and the finals scenes in which the Wyatt and Billy are gunned down the some men who murdered their companion just days before. The film is definitely shocking but does get its point across.",Easy Rider
192,m-bailey8,easy rider,8,6 December 2010,"This movie was actually very interesting. The story itself didn't have a lot of action scenes, or anyone double crossing each other. It was a good and interesting story to watch without all of what people usually see in a movie. I really liked how the story dealt with social issues that were current in the 60s. The movie had many scenes that dealt with drugs, sex, alcohol, and the hippie generation. The movie seemed to have shown things and dealt with issues that some people wouldn't like or give it a chance. The ending surprised me the most. I thought about half way through the movie of how this movie could possibly end. I didn't actually think that the movie would end with both of them dying. In a way, though, the ending was right. Not all people understood hippies and the rebels of the 60s. Some hated the concept of it, and the end of the movie showed that.Besides a great story, the acting was great and the cinematography was great. I thought of how good the camera work was because many scenes were with the two main characters riding their bikes on the road, so to get the shots to be so smooth is amazing. The story was great and it showed many points of views of people in the 60s.",Easy Rider
193,n-racicot,Easy Rider,8,14 December 2010,"The Film Easy Rider was made in 1969. It stars and was directed by Dennis Hopper. It was written by Peter Fonda(who also stars along side Hopper), Dennis Hopper and Terry Southern. Considered an American road movie, it has a creative storyline telling the tale of two nomad bikers in search of true freedom.Just the two men and the road. Along the way they encounter people along the way that make them change the way they think and want to live. Their search of freedom symbolizes the rise and fall of the hippie movement. The hippies and the bikers used similar methods while trying to reach their destination of freedom such as drugs, opposition of establishment, open unprotected sex, and communal bonding with each other. Both failed to get where they wanted to go. They were not understood by the rest of society so what resulted was growing dislike for both. The filming of the movie was done mainly outdoors under a low budget. Open landscape shots were placed to emphasize the idea of having nothing holding on to you thus creating the feeling of freedom. The outcome proved that low budget films were able to make a strong impact like high budget films. A great movie!",Easy Rider
194,cinema_student2010,???,4,17 December 2010,"I had heard of this movie, that it was an American classic and was a must watch. So i was kind of excited when I had to watch it for a class. Now im just left wondering what all the hype was about. Maybe its just not my taste. I found it hard to follow at times, but maybe that was just because the movie was just so ridiculously boring.The highlight of the movie for me was Jack Nicholson's performance. I find the whole feeling of the movie just kind of strange, roaming. In a nutshell its these two guys just roaming around. I understand that the movie was suppose to representative of the time and the changes that were occurring in America. Although I like unpredictable movies,The ending to the movie really kind of disturbed me. To think peoples intolerance would result in senseless murders of people who did nothing to them. The most interesting scene would be when their high with a prostitute. The cameras flash quickly and their a lot of splices that were interesting enough to catch my attention. They do a great job of making you understand their on a lsd/drug trip, kind of makes you feel disoriented, like you are in it. I would of liked to have seen a better sound track, I think it would of made the film more interesting. Having seen Dennis Hopper in some of his more recent films before his death, it was very interesting to a younger version. If my professor hadnt of pointed him out I think I would of missed him. My professor informed us that this one of the first films after the hayes code ended to explore subjects like they did. So that alone makes it an important film in my opinion. Even though I didn't enjoy it, I would still recommend seeing it.",Easy Rider
195,crivers123,Easy Rider (1969),4,3 May 2011,"I can't say I enjoyed very much of Easy Rider (1969). I can say I'm glad I didn't ever pay to see it in the theaters. As far as story goes, I feel that it was just a glorified music video. The cinematography of the landscape was very beautiful, but not what I'm looking for in terms of being drawn into a film. I felt more as if I were being lulled to sleep with the little amount of dialog and the slow moving pace. i will say that the director and cinematographer did an excellent job at editing the footage and making it feel like the audience themselves are on a road trip. Speaking of trip. I know it is a classic, but I could have done without the acid trip scene. The weird, grainy shots while they are all in the cemetery just puts a bad taste in my mouth -so to speak. I feel that this film was one much more for the specific generation for which it was made, at least it doesn't really ""speak"" to me in terms of being free or being different than what is usually accepted. The two guys were just awkward stoners who didn't seem to have accomplished much, but somehow had this unfounded, wise look on life. I didn't expect them to be shot at the end. But throughout the entire movie I didn't really know what was going to happen next. Like i said, it wasn't much of a story.",Easy Rider
196,NOXiFy,Great movie... if you're tripping on acid/shrooms.,2,23 April 2012,"I really disliked this movie. From beginning to end. It really doesn't have much of a plot or a structure to it, the movie follows two best friends who ride around and sell cocaine. The story lacked a real cause and I couldn't justify myself ever watching it again. The filming and audio was great but the actual story was absolutely terrible. The movie was most likely shot for someone to do a psychedelic drug and then watch the movie because that's honestly the only way somebody could possibly like a movie as terrible as this one. Like I stated, it gets a 2 out of 10 for having no plot and being an overall terrible movie. Would NOT see again or recommend.",Easy Rider
197,juanathan,A Flawed Masterpiece,10,11 July 2005,"To me, a flawed masterpiece is a film that is not perfect but by the end achieves something so great it overcomes its' flaws. The two films I can honestly say that about are Lars Von Trier's Dancer In The Dark and Easy Rider. Easy Rider perfectly defines it.The flaws: Well, the first half although entertaining it pointless. They basically just ride around and pick up hippies and go to a commune. Peter Fonda although he looks the part but for some reason something seemed missing from his character. Also, in the beginning there is a pretty annoying editing technique which they luckily soon abandon.The film really gets astounding in the second half. The whole film is shot very well by DP Laszlo Kovacs and the music might be one of the best soundtracks ever in film. I might even buy it. The film is filled with genuinely poetic ideas. Jack Nicholson gives a star making performance and Dennis Hopper is once again and forever THE MAN. This film is filled with many biblical metaphors which never came off as pretentious but very powerful. The film is filled with very strong visuals. No wonder Dennis Hopper once wanted to work with Alejandro Jodorwsky. The ending is might be the best part of the movie. It is almost the ultimate ""what the f*ck?' moment in history, but for such a chaotic film it fits perfectly. The ending is also powerful. It represented to me the end of a generation.Well okay. This movie I know will definitely not please everybody but for those who are open minded and into visually driven films, this film will certainly live up to its' title as one of the most influential films in American history.",Easy Rider
198,b-kelly13,an unexpected ending!,5,17 December 2010,"This film directed by Dennis Hopper has a slow start. If you enjoy hippie 1960s drug type films, then this is the film for you. The dialog seemed very monotone. It was as though you had to force yourself to listen what they were talking about, without any sort of change in their tone of voice. Although it starts off slow there are key moments of suspense and action toward the end. For one, the scene where the two bikers find the two girls, and decide to do LSD with them in the cemetery. This scene was shot very well. There is different sort of effects and colors. This scene keeps you on the edge of your feet because it seems as though all of them had a bad experience with the LSD so you see many different things on the screen that they were seeing during their drug experience, which I thought was a realistic touch. This film also had a very unexpected ending! So if you enjoy a good ending, which you did not expect, then this is the film for you!",Easy Rider
199,jrippz,uhhhhhhhhhhh,9,17 December 2010,"Easy Rider's a movie that gradually reveals more of itself as it goes on. It's beautifully put together in this manner as you learn there's a lot more under the exterior of the hippies/a lot more to the film. For the first 35 minutes I thought this was a terrible movie. The movie really begins to pick up Jack Nicholson's character is introduced. Firstly, Jack is just fantastic as his character, but that's really when the film starts peeling itself. The drug crash scene in the cemetery is really profound in a way. You feel the pain of the struggling characters. It totally reminded of something out of Hideaki Anno's Neon Genesis Evangelion.

This film embodies the counterculture adventure of the late sixties in a way thats revealing and very fun to watch, full of comedy, beautiful landscape shots, and a double barrel dose of surprise. I found the best part of the film to be Jack Nicholson's reasoning for why people are offended by the film's stars. Nicholson's character was an integral part of the film, who brought out themes and ideas that would have been missed otherwise. While most of the film held a coherent and consistent style, the acid trip scene threw me off. It was interesting, creative, and held cryptic meaning, but completely interrupted the movies flow for me. Thankfully the film succeeded in not only bringing me back in, but leaving me with profound shock at the abrupt and meaningfully violent close.",Easy Rider

The older generation did not change with the times but instead, their children did, the new generation. In the new generation there are things that are surprising as as illegal. However it is just a new way to show old things. Drugs have been around as well as different styles of clothing and sex. However with the new generation it is much more public. Easy Rider, although it shows all of these things more publicly, it also shows how the new generation feels.

202,JoshuaC96,Easy Rider,5,7 December 2010,"I didn't particularly care for easy rider. I think it's a good movie, especially for the time it was made. It's definitely a significant film, but it just wasn't for me. Easy rider touched on a lot of interesting topics such as hippies and intolerance, communes, and drug use. It was cool to watch the main characters on their quest for freedom, and I thought the film gave an interesting depiction of people from that era. I like to ride a motorcycle myself so at first I really loved the great shots of the open road and the country side. However, constant scenes of the duo's road trip became extremely boring rather quickly. The best parts of the film, or at least my favorites, were the scenes with Jack Nicholson. His character was very entertaining and humorous. I loved when he was talking about space aliens. I've seen a lot of sci-fi films and alien movies, but I had never heard aliens discussed quite that way and with the points he was making. Sadly, after Nicholson's character died I was again very board with the film. Dennis Hopper's character was annoying, although he played him well. I thought Peter Fonda's performance was bland and not very convincing. Also he was often rather emotionally ambiguous, even at crucial moments in the film. It may have been intentional, perhaps to portray the character as being detached and distant, but I didn't like it; it made the movie unnecessarily tough to understand. The whole thing was really drawn out and slow, far too simple, and poorly edited; the whole flash back and forth at every scene transition was just retarded in my opinion. Also the acid trip sequence went on for way too long.",Easy Rider
203,alexv1208,Review of Easy Rider,8,15 December 2010,"Great film, what the 60's were all about. Easy Rider is an accurate representation of what was going on during the 60's, and how many people felt towards society. There was a lot of rebellion, and sex, and drugs. This film is much more explicit than most films before it. It reveals topics that people weren't really discussing at that point. It also shows the generation gap between the youth of that time and their parents. There was a major difference in what was considered okay or enjoyable between the youth and their parents. The film is visually appealing, and beautifully shot. The shots of Arizona make it obvious that there are more important things than silly quarrels, and that it is more important to appreciate beauty and life.",Easy Rider

I thought it was too long and seemed to just drag on as Wyatt and Billy travel across the states encountering different types of people as they go.Aside from me disliking the movie i think it shows a lot about what life was like for many almost outlaw type people during that time period. the main story, living along side these two bikers as they make travel cross country drinking and smoking and partying whenever they can. you get to see how life is on a commune. the part in the film showing Billy, Wyatt, and the two hookers as they experience a powerful hallucinogen was incredible.I think overall the film is an attempt at showing how times were changing and how many different groups of people were reacting to the changes.Was not my favorite but id say it is worth seeing at least once.",Easy Rider

Also, where some did not enjoy the sometimes lengthy scenes of riding through the country. I enjoyed the visuals presented. I think this movie did a very good job of showing the counter culture of the time. The commune part of the film was done very well along with the acid trip scene. I think one of the main reasons I enjoyed the movie so much is because this is something that I would like to do myself (minus some of the drugs) at some point in my life. This is a great example of a post classical Hollywood film because of the drugs and the sex. I don't think this movie would be appealing to everyone, especially those who are not into motorcycles, it is however an interesting story of their travels.",Easy Rider
206,utubeslasher,some interesting views on freedom counterculture and prejudice,5,15 December 2011,I'm really on the fence about this movie... i didn't really know what to expect... and it got to the half way point and i found myself asking what is going on? granted they tell you they are going to new Orleans for Mardi gras so the point is clear... but the story meanders around aimlessly for a while... perhaps to reflect the lofty idea of freedom they are hunting... the acting was a little rigid peter Fonda had all of like 15 lines in the whole thing Dennis hopper strayed between over the top and kind of un natural... the 3 flash scene transitions were distracting and really took me out of it... the acid trip sequence i felt was really well done... its really only at the point they picked up jack Nicholson i felt like the story was advancing and an extra dimension was added to the group dynamic... the use of music that reflected the culture explored was good... the sudden harsh discrimination in the last 1/4 of the movie was a huge jump from the rest of it.. jack Nicholson's death that was basically brushed off seemed like a waste really... and the end with the characters deaths also seemed not necessary... the characters search for freedom they failed in was best concluded with the they blew it scene... no need to kill them in the really lazy way they did... have some stupid hick say I'm gon scare um... BLAM! what happened? oh nothing you just shot the guy... then the random exploding of the other bike and the inferred burning of the money... i don't know... this was probably poignant at the time but it seemed really half cocked to me,Easy Rider
207,danburyn,movie with no plot,2,30 April 2012,"this movie was awful, a movie with no plot, bad acting, and bad editing. it never showed any progress through out the film. they buy drugs in Mexico, then go on a trip to New Orleans which really does not make sense at all, and finally get shot by two hicks on a country road. another thing they do in this movie is demote womens role in society. Every single one is either living of the land as a hippie or a prostitute. another thing was the editing of the film nothing was clean about the cuts. I also did not like the fast back and forth cuts which gave a sense of tension when it was not necessary. over all this movie was awful again I would not recommend this movie because nothing happens worth watching.",Easy Rider
208,NineFelines,Difficult Counterculture Classic,5,30 April 2012,"For me, Easy Rider did a great job of establishing the fact that I do not yet understand the generation gap as evidenced by the 1960s. Assuming, of course, it is a somewhat true depiction of the feelings of more than its creators. The box office earnings seem to substantiate that it resonated with the times. Perhaps you did simply have to be there.The movie doesn't appear to have a real focus, other than to show a series of increasingly unfortunate events which occur to two relatively harmless and mostly good-natured drug dealers with long hair who ride motorcycles, want to party in New Orleans and who occasionally pick up the odd passenger. I think I understand the message they seem to be attempting to convey (something along the lines of ""the establishment doesn't understand us"" and ""we just want to be free to find/be ourselves""); I simply fail to see how this movie advances that cause.On the technical side, there were a couple of interesting cinematographic effects such as the time transition when they stop for the first couple of nights and the cemetery drug induced debauchery, but otherwise it seemed relatively mundane. I did not appreciate the end. It was abrupt and seemed more like they ran out of money to make more movie than an intentional, satisfactory conclusion. Unless, maybe I'm missing something here as well?",Easy Rider
209,d-burgess3,What the!,2,25 April 2012,This movie was quite tedious and not the type of movie I would sit and watch so it had me very anxious to stop watching. As for the characters which I don't know much about only from class hand-outs they seemed a bit flat I guess just being rebellious hippies. They whole journey to me was very dull and could have been better. Then again I'm not a fan of movies like these old western looking type movies. Also the end of this movie was a bit vague as in to the rebellious hippie being able to get away after the big explosion. I despise endings where the bad people get away. Then again they are the main characters. I just don't understand why this is recognized as a classic. You give credit where credit is due. Right? In my opinion this movie in my eyes is not consider of any significance.,Easy Rider
210,alooftrashman,The Sixties Incarnate,8,28 April 2010,"In a haze of movements and head nods, comes the tale the leaves as quickly as it begins. Easy Rider epitomizes what the 60s stood for, from counter-culture to wayfaring across the country.Dennis Hopper delivers this visceral ride the only way a B-movie can; and in many ways that's advantageous to the movie. Low production values give the essence of rawness, and the verisimilitude for the era is about as close as it gets to feeling like an actual documentary. Peter Fonda and Hopper are great as leads, and their ride cross-country never feels contrived or out of place.Aimless, perhaps, but that's the era. The music is top-notch, every anti-establishment artist sans CCR can be found with a track here. Characters come as quickly as they go, as random listless faces populate the screen at every turn. Jack Nicholson's unfortunate foray into his first try with marijuana ends with tragedy, and I have to wonder if Hopper was trying to say that people driving cross-country doing random drugs and meeting random people had ill effects on the people that got tangled in their web of debauchery.They got theirs in the end, and again I have to wonder what Hopper and Fonda were trying to say by getting the lead axed. Perhaps they were going for different representations of the American flag and how the South perceives northerners, or hippies vs. stiffs. At any rate, any movie that makes you think this much by doing so little is definitely worth my time, even if the ending was abrupt.",Easy Rider
211,peterlonglongplong,There's more to this movie than meets the eye.,7,2 August 2007,"I'm amazed that lots of the negative reviews focus on the drugs. This movie does not promote drugs. Fonda portrays a self-absorbed, aloof thinking stoner; I knew several back in the 70's. But Hopper acts more like a tweaker than a pot smoker. The movie shows some of the aspects of life in the 60's, but like anything, it's limited in scope. We see a trip back east on motorcycles of two hippies who made money from drugs. Like a pleasing work of art, we get to view some good scenery in several of the types of desert in our southern states. We get to see an interracial couple with kids inviting the bikers to dinner. Then a hitchhiker takes us to a commune. I almost joined a commune in the 70's and even if this looked like a failure of human experiments, it was a beautiful one. As if people can't see that capitalism is STILL AN EXPERIMENT. And it's not in the greatest shape right now. Of course, to keep the movie watchable to the masses and acceptable to the promoters (who are mostly from the big cities on the coasts) we saw these guys get into trouble in little towns of the south. Just so people don't start to believe that this is the way of the entire south, redneck, prejudiced slime buckets exist everywhere on this planet. There is a town I won't name in Michigan that reminds me of that line from another movie, ""you sure got a pretty mouth"". Because of the close relations of people in small towns, if a couple, or a few total as*h*l** get into positions of power, the town can be unsafe to people from elsewhere. The movie does often require us to suspend our belief, but it was an experimental film. Generally, the movie shows the problems involved with 'so-called' freedom and escapist drugs. It shows what closed mindedness can cause some people to do. After seeing the movie when I was young, I was 10 when it was made, I believed until my adult years that long hair and a liberal attitude in the south would get you shot. Fortunately, on my business trips to Texas, Louisiana, etc., where I had some free time to explore, I discovered something completely different. Open-minded, thinking, caring people are everywhere and my own San Francisco Bay Area has plenty of rednecks. The movie is a good portrayal of types of people, scenery, and great music. And Hopper does act more like an amphetamine snorter. Hollywood never quite has the real world down. But then, Hollywood, and the people in the limelight there, are rarely in the real world.",Easy Rider
212,bellsa037,Easy Rider,7,24 April 2010,"In the beginning movie, the director grabs the attention of the audiences who love motorcycle. Besides, the director uses extreme close-up to present the details of the motorcycle while he was putting the money in the motorcycle. There are many good musics(nondiegetic sound) performed while they were ridding the motorcycles; this gives the feeling as they open music during driving a car. In addition, the director tries to photograph while they were ridding in many directions, so widescreen is very suitable for this situation because the camera can cover two motorcycles, and the audiences would be able to see more views of the background, especially the natural views such as mountain, and it is really good for the parade scene too because the audiences can see the performance. Moreover, the director uses technique to switch the last shot and the next shot(flash-forward) back and ford so that two shots would be more continuity. Furthermore, almost every scene is photographed from the real place, so this is cheaper than arranging in a studio. Besides, the artificial light is seldom used; the light of each scene is from natural light. These help reduce the budget to make the movie. Lastly, in the scene that the riders climb up to the small hill in the evening, and the audiences can see them look like shadow; I think it is very arts.",Easy Rider
213,JamesDean1955,A generational hand-me down,10,5 December 2010,"This film, for me, was truly great. I found it to strike a very near and dear chord of mine because of my great desire to take the country by storm, mounted on an iron horse glad in rubber boots. This movie also spoke to my soul in the sense that it is based in the great, historic year of 1969. My personal fascination with the 1960's and the social revolution that engulfed that time period both adds greatly to my sense of wonder, and fantasy for my outlook on modern times. This film embodies freedom. Touring the country on motorcycles, with an open mind and only the clothes on their back. This is a great fantasy of mine, and is one I plan to fulfill this summer with my best friend. I believe that my generation ( i am 20 years old ), is up against a lot more than we can possibly imagine. We stay hidden behind our computers, cell phones, and video games. I am guilty of using these means of technology but i strongly advocate the willingness to act and to live. Instead of living life through a computer screen ( like the majority does ) I believe one should take to the open road, get submerged in nature, rough it, and explore all that is out there. This movie really captures it, it speaks it, it speaks what was going on during that time period and the desperate need for change. The breaking of traditional, poisonous views, and getting in touch with all that is real. A personal conquest for truth is something my generation should be more focused on. We as a generation need another revolution and need to do so following in the footsteps of the 1960's generation, but learning from their mistakes, and striving for originality, instead of living off the table scraps of what conspired almost 50 years ago. This movie should be an inspiration for minds like mine, minds in search of freedom and truth. Escaping the clutches of society and discovering oneself is essential. Rotting away on a couch, submerged in the glow of a computer screen is poison, and the quicker my generation comes to that realization, the quicker we will get to forming a revolt against our current conditions. This movie is actually quite perfect for my generation. I know for me, it was certainly motivational and inspiring to watch. Many ignorant man alike quickly pass movies like this off as being just another hippy, drug infested, dreamer movie. Many still laugh at those in search of truth, but i think the message behind this film is way greater than what is often perceived. The message falls deaf on the years of those not in tune. Sadly, the majority of my generation are tuned out, too busy with updating their status on facebook and catching the latest episode of "" jersey shore "", to realize the shape our country is in and the complete and udder filth that is occurring on a daily basis in Washington. I recommend this film to the liberated mind, to the dreamers, and to those who missed or jumped off the bandwagon of our culture today. And even if you are apart of the sad culture that is of today, you should put down your cell phone long enough to let this film soak in, watch it twice if need be.

In the scene where it starts off with just blades of grass or wheat , you hear talking but you see no one. It took time to show the two men talking, it was an interesting way of looking at it. The different angles of them on their bikes, it shows the from the back, looking at them on them from the side and also showing them riding towards the camera. It keeps the movie interesting. The two main star men had very interesting personalities and they also helped kept that interesting perspective about the movie. When it starts doing a visual shot of the bridge, and it gradually lowers to show the 2 men riding their bikes, shows what an interesting ride they have ahead of the. The way the film started out was also interesting starts off with them appearing closer on their bikes, but the gradually as they are riding away they appear farther because the camera does not follow them.",Easy Rider
215,yilmazomar,Easy Rider,10,19 December 2012,"It's worth watching for the sheer beauty of its rock and roll infused shots of shining choppers gliding across the deserts. The hippie culture and the counter movement are not things I'm personally familiar with, I know as much as the next Y generation kid. But I did appreciate how the film didn't necessarily glorify anything whether it be America, drugs, alcohol, the average Joe or freedom/the American dream. In fact the film seemed to raise a good amount of questions about them. The two characters in the film Hopper and Fonda weren't necessarily admirable people, the freedom of riding your motorbike across America wasn't as great as you imagined it would be, and besides they were doing this to get drugs to a certain destination. I felt as if though the film presented these two characters in such a way which almost veiled what they really were and made them out to be charismatic and likable fellows. I didn't feel as if there was any message in the film which we haven't heard, nothing extraordinary, it was a pretty average film in terms of message. The story itself was simple but it was told beautifully with images and music. I think the film showed how banal and senseless the actual counterculture can be, if you look at the film it never celebrates the hippies in fact it presents them negatively, it also does the same thing with middle America, in fact I didn't feel as if the film ever really showed us who the good guys were.",Easy Rider

The effect used to transition into other scenes was interesting, i found that the flashing was rather jarring. There were some really bizarre long takes and just bizarre happenings in general. I wonder how much of this was realistic for the time period or just Dennis Hoppers drug induced perception of things. Jack Nicholson's character George was hilarious. The cinematography and editing last 15 minutes of the film i think was the best. It was raw, washed out, had some great angles, sounds and images. The music in this film really made it. It worked well for the time period and the content of the film.",Easy Rider

And when I finally did, I was very disappointed. Even though I myself love to ride and anyone who knows me will quickly agree that I'm a nonconformist, I just didn't like this movie much. It was boring, probably because it lacks a plot. And to be honest, the acting wasn't much good either, with the possible exception of Jack Nicholson. The LSD scene was just too weird, even for someone who's dropped acid in the past. The music and the photography are the only good things about the movie. And the ending, which is as close to a plot as it ever came. Still, I recommend seeing it if you're into Harleys or 60's rock, but just rent it, as you're not likely to want to watch it again.",Easy Rider
218,B-Seide24,What a Great Film,8,5 May 2010,"This is by far the greatest road movie of all time. I appreciate the views that Dennis hopper give you as the director of the film. Hopper did a fantastic job of following Captain America and Billy throughout the southwest and south in a journey to find ""freedom"" and in time whatever it is that they were looking for. It was also quinessential to see the interaction between Billy, Captain America and their new friend George Hanson played by Jack Nicklaus. After getting them released from jail and telling him they are going New Orleans, George decides to tag along. This is when he comes across marijuana for the first time. At first he is afraid because ""it leads to harder stuff"" but eventually trys it. This scene is so great because it truly mimics the life of what a pot smoker is, smoking and often losing the cherry on the joint due to the fact that he could not stop talking. It showed a liberation of themselves and truly adds to the depth of the movie. Without the interaction from a Non-freedom rider, you truly get to see Captain America and Billy in a light that you don't see when their just together. Their radical movement to be free and eventually escape to what there looking for puts them in some bad predicaments and eventually their demise. Easy Rider is very influential to me and I'm sure the people of that time who were looking to find a way to be ""Free"".",Easy Rider

I loved a lot of the dialog, especially when Jack Nicholson makes his appearance, and I love the theme and message the film conveys. However, there a multiple scenes that drag on way to long without anything substantial happening. I understand that the point of these scenes was to convey the lifestyle, but I couldn't help but be incredibly bored by some scenes, namely the commune. I never connected with a character more so than when Dennis Hopper has had enough of the commune, and say something along the lines of ""Lets get the hell out of here, man"" I knew exactly how he felt and was glad I wasn't actually there with him, and could leave the boredom and craziness much easier than he could.",Easy Rider

This film brings to light all the biggest points of the time period (i.e. the commune, drug scene, anti-hippie attitudes). The acid trip scene has been described as the closest you can imagine to actually being on acid. The acting is superb as you would imagine from the names but at the time these were a couple of relatively unknown actors (Peter Fonda being the most well known at the time). Nicholson's performance might be my favorite of the film and he's just plain funny as always. The only gripe I have against the film is that it seemed to end very abruptly. I don't really know the intention behind it but I just felt like the ending was rushed. Other than that this is a great film and I would recommend it to anybody as these three actors complement each other so well.",Easy Rider

It is definitely worth seeing the movie in HD: views on landscapes are carefully mixed with the story.With many scenes shot close to the actors, it's easy to 'feel' within the story. Overall, the length of the scenes suited the movie well. Some camera cuts were inventive but maybe a little annoying. The actors' performance was great, portraying open-minded Peter Fonda and hesitating Dennis Hopper. They give the film a peaceful progress. The different persons and communities they meet were very credibly put together, resulting in authentic 'clashes' and 'mixes' of cultures.The music fit the film.

It didn't really feel to me like there was all that much in terms of plot, and it was difficult for me to keep an interest in the film. I couldn't really figure out what message the movie was trying to convey. The only concepts that I could grasp were that the main characters had made a drug deal at the beginning of the movie, had stored the money in the gas tank, were on their way to mardi-gras, then continue on after doing some acid and wind up getting shot by some random redneck. What was going on? Why did they leave mardi-gras after going all that way to get there? How does Captain America think they ""Blew it"" (whatever ""it"" is)? There was just so much to this movie that I wasn't able to understand. Maybe someone who could follow it a little better could get some more enjoyment out of it, but I just can't bring myself to give this a high rating.",Easy Rider

The transitions of each scene is pretty terrible in the first part of the movie, but eventually it did get better.They end up traveling to New Orleans and while on their way there they have to make a drug deal of which is a white substance, which looked as if it was cocaine.
One thing this movie really exceeded in was the music and the backgrounds. It really showed great science of what traveling across the United States is really like.The ending of the movie you don't end up finding out if they make it or not.

I loved the establishing shots/the shots of nature whether it be trees, sunsets or o rivers. The use of Bright colors made this film a lot more appealing to me. The 2 men go through a journey and it seems like we're also apart of the group riding with them. They used music like any other movie does and the song selections are pretty good. They do a lot of close up angles on certain objects such as the bike tire and the scenes with music playing/when their riding has a lot of cuts. This movie really helped the new Hollywood era kick off into a widely loved era. Natural light is the main lighting used in this movie. Since the guys are mainly outside the whole time. The movie is based off of drugs and is the main focus point in this movie and it gets them in trouble.I wasn't the fan of the end of the movie at all though, the fact that they got killed off felt very unnecessary To me and left a bad taste in my mouth. Overall it'll always be a classic",Easy Rider
225,jsataluri,Drugged Beyond Boredom,3,30 June 2007,"When my father and I watched this film, I expected just more than a drug film talking about the dangers of the drug use. Instead we received a film that was really drugged beyond boredom. It's just about two young druggies (Peter Fonda and Dennis Hopper) searching for the American dream, except doing it the wrong way. Along the way, they meet with up Jack Nicholson's character, a alcoholic lawyer who does not really know the meaning of freedom. He is sort of a guide to them, telling them about the dangers of being free. Everyone will fear them and will become dangerous. This observation is noticed when they enter a restaurant that they realize that they are not being served, but being discriminated by the rednecks in the place, resulting with Nicholson's death. Then it rambles on into a LSD scene, which is very graphic, confusing and lost my interest towards the end when both are killed.I will give credit to the cinematographer for his beautiful portrayal of the countryside and wired-out scenes of the LSD sexual rampage. The music is also fantastic and shows the decline of the hippies/LSD generation throughout the films. Unfortunately, the performances were not at par with the film. Only Jack Nicholson was good to watch. I am totally disgusted with the tone of this film. I guess I didn't really understand the theme of this film and I should have been in a different mood in order to view this film, but the search for paradise through this look is atrocious. I guess I can understand some of the meanings of what this film is trying to depict, but this is not a film that I would like to view again.3/10.",Easy Rider

227,scotty12,Unforgettable sense of freedom,8,6 December 2000,"Though it was made in the 1960s, this excellent film gives insights into many timeless themes.  In random order, these include the search for meaning in life, sense of freedom, the importance of an alternative lifestyle (shown in both the hippie/commune and biker culture), the difficulty of coping with a changing order, intolerance of difference and bigotry, and the role of recreational drug use.The situations and characters show a wonderful naivety - what you see is what you get from everyone.  Nobody plays games or tries to hide their true feelings.  Sometimes what we get is deep and fine (eg the farmer's family), other times it's deep and terrible (southern rednecks), or other times again it doesn't amount to much (eg commune drama), but is still totally honest. What is really great about this movie is that it encourages the viewer to acknowledge their own feelings about the themes in an equally direct and honest way, but also to realise that none of these aspects are totally clear cut.The movie won't please everyone, because the demands of the film for honesty are too much for some.  Though many will like the wonderful entertainment, especially the cinematography and soundtrack.  (How did we ever get away from such fine music 30 years ago to what we have today?)For me, the most evocative aspect is the long road scenes.  These need to be long because they actually give a personal sensation of freedom in the way only American roads can.  Often you feel you personally are on a third (unseen) bike travelling in a group with the other two.  Not that many road movies manage this.Jack Nicholson of course was the stand-out actor and Dennis Hopper was very good, but I feel that Peter Fonda's performance was also first rate.  He gave a dispassionate distance to all that was happening which somehow encourages you to observe but not judge.Unforgettable images and has the possibility to change your life perspective.  That has to make it a really first-rate movie - and it is. One of my top 20 movies.",Easy Rider

229,midnightrane,Bitter Pill,8,4 January 2002,"A sprawling classic, filmed with mesmerizing sweep and scope. The film plays like it's subject matter; fun-loving, drugged, beautiful, scary and bitter. An early herald to indie film, ""Easy Rider"" has become the flagship for an entire (counter)culture and retains all it's impact years later. It's a journey that must be experienced to be appreciated, so see it for yourself. Featuring a myriad of scenery, supporting characters and locales it effectively brings to life--life on the road. Not merely a ""period"" piece, it survives today as an accomplished endeavor. Dennis Hopper is nearly unrecognizable and Jack Nicholson is a haunting drunkard. Peter Fonda provides a continuity of purpose and image. Boasting an incredible soundtrack, ""Easy Rider"" is a great ride, but not easy. It's ending will leave you slack-jawed and somewhat bitter, but it is an enduring image. I give it a 8/10 and considering it's origins and durability it might deserve higher marks.",Easy Rider

Jack Nicholson of course is nothing but great, especially in the campfire scene when he was introduced to weed just such a great scene.

Peter Fonda and Dennis Hopper are modern day outlaws in the great western tradition but instead of horses, they ride hogs. Part western, part road film, part buddy picture and part rebellion against establishment, Easy Rider wears many hats but it's most fitting one is that of ambassador for the greatness of America. Wear Woody Allen films make you love the clutter and clamor or New York City, Easy Rider makes you love the unending openness of the west and the freedom and liberty that the openness represents. The film's message is a bit heavy handed and the narrative drags at times but Easy Rider is a film that every American should see so that they can truly understand the majesty of this great nation.",Easy Rider

Don't waste your time on this movie, it's just a bunch of hippies doing drugs, litterally that's all it is.  Nothing HAPPENS.  God these movies drive me nuts.  One star out of 50.  Boring.  Pointless. Visually uninteresting.  Poorly acted.  Poorly edited.  Poorly written, if even written at all.  Seriously, I can't believe this movie is famous.

If you are looking for a convoluted plot or one that will blow your mind intellectually, then you have picked the wrong movie. I suppose the simplicity of the plot, and the story to an extent, make it a mindless movie that one can enjoy any time.The movie wasn't filmed in a sophisticated manor. The jump cuts in between scenes, soon become boring and repetitive. It works in a strange way though. It is jolting and fits the disjointed feel of the rest of the movie. As far as filming goes, the ""acid trip"" in the latter half of the movie is possibly the most interesting and well done. It is edited well for both sound and the visuals that we see.Over all, its a very enjoyable movie, but story seems to be a bit lacking, like I said before. Its a real cultural piece and I'm sure that it had a much bigger impact on viewers when it was first released.",Easy Rider
234,LuckyGraveyardBoots,One of the most intriguing and provocative I have seen,10,9 May 2006,"You can look at it as important in either of two ways: either it's the key film of the '60's and the singularly elusive way to understanding that generation, or it's a searing look at just how, why, and where the American Dream finally died - in this way it stonedly resonates with Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas (set in 1971) even though F&L is more about how the American Dream got crippled, addicted to something vague, and kept limping around in the desert for no particular reason - than its actual death. Either way, you have to watch it at least once in your life. It's also famous for popularizing the song ""Born to be Wild"", motorcycles, and Jack Nicholson, so it's plenty of fun. It starts and ends very mysteriously, but it seems oddly seamless, in the same way that it's a timeless journey while being extremely 'dated', so to speak. Billy and Captain America (played by Dennis Hopper and Peter Fonda, respectively) pop out of the landscape on their motorbikes, purportedly from L.A. although there is really no way of knowing who they are or where they're from. Bound for New Orleans in time for Mardi Gras, they ride all day through the heartland of the USA and camp out at night because nobody will let them stay in a hotel. After a surreal stay at a hippie commune in the middle of nowhere (complete with its own come-again Jesus) they continue, only to be arrested in a small Southern town for 'parading without a permit'. It is there that they meet George (Jack Nicholson), a rich man's son with a mind of his own who decides to come with them to New Orleans to a legendary whorehouse. The movie begins to all make sense during a scene with George by a campfire following the first of several nasty hillbilly encounters, in which George theorizes that the reason people like Billy and Captain America are ostracized by a comfortable middle class is that people are afraid of freedom...they can talk about it at length, but when it actually comes to a totally free person, not tied down by anything, people hate them because they know how trapped they are. True freedom is scary to them. By the tragic ending, we see that it's true. It seems like this film is one long easy ride towards the end - symbolized by death, a cemetery scene towards the finish, the hippies sowing nothing but sand on their fields. Even the characters seem mythological, looking back...George is the voice of reason, ultimately silenced by fear of the unknown. Billy, a wild, distrustful schizophrenic, is representative of all those outcast by society or deemed too irregular to exist by normal standards. And Captain America - brooding, thoughtful, restrained - seems very much like the Dream itself in its final days...forever contemplating where it's gone, and not giving much thought to where it's going next. All in all, it's key to understanding a lot of things. In that landscape, with everything stripped away (home, possessions, dialogue...everything but the spirit) anything could seem possible. And Easy Rider is one of those rare movies that don't give you much to go on. What you take away from it is entirely dependent on the thought you bring to it.",Easy Rider
235,k-boughton,An overall bad trip,5,5 May 2021,"This film was a bad trip in every sense of the term. The film started out with the hippy lifestyle which although not accepted by a lot of America, was filled with peace and love to all. As the film continued so did the physical trip that Wyatt and Billy embarked on, as their trip continued away from the hippies the peace and love also went away slowly. The last decent person they encountered was George, the typical American man who was raised by strict parents and used alcohol to cope with the real world he was forced to be a part of. Georges character represented the transition from the happy part of the film to the negative half of the film. His death represented the fact that certain parts of America were not ready for the changes the late 1960's had brought to the country. After the murder of George the film was basically a drug trip almost trying to distract the viewer from what had happened. The drug trip even took the viewers along for the ride, we were able to see the actors act it out and hear the dialogue while experiencing the recklessness that the actors were experiencing in their minds. The deaths at the end although shocking were not completely unexpected, their trip had ended in the drug sense but also in their traveling, they had made it to New Orleans and their trip was over.",Easy Rider
236,tinyredspoons,Watch it for Jack Nicholson,9,13 May 2011,"Watching Easy Rider was a breath of fresh air, reminding me that not all movies need to have constant never-ending action or complicated and convoluted dialogue. The gentle sweeping shots of beautiful landscape is calming, and complimented by the rock and roll soundtrack. Though the characters do obviously converse, most of their interactions are comprised of slow drawn out chuckles or on the part of Hopper just plain strange mumbling. One slowly begins to wonder if his character is ""all there"". Jack Nicholson's short role in the movie is probably what makes it most worth watching. His drunk diatribes and antics are perfectly executed and though he is only on screen for a short time, his the most memorable character. The movie also employs some very ""advant-garde"" editing techniques to show Hopper and Fonda's acid trip, which is interesting to see considering one would have never seen such a thing only a few years before.",Easy Rider

Eventually they get arrested in a small town for parading without a permit. In the small town jail they meet an alcoholic lawyer character played by Jack Nicholson who decides to join them on their quest.

Since this film is considered to be New Hollywood, it remains legendary for it's exposure of real drug use (such as marijuana and LSD). It also explores the societal issues and tensions in the U.S. during the 60's such as the rise and fall of the hippie movement, drug use and communal lifestyle. Easy Rider combines a perfect balance of mesmerizing scenery with an amazing soundtrack, almost making it more of an experience than a film. I think the main message is that in life, a ""middle road"" is necessary. Life isn't only about embracing individuality and freedom, it's also about remembering that a little structure must exist.",Easy Rider

For starters, the film contains an unoriginal soundtrack; songs are incorporated that were recorded before the movie was even filmed. Secondly, the film contains a long list of content that would have been Hayes Code infractions, such as the selling and ingesting of illegal substances and lewd conduct. The protagonists with whom the audience sympathizes are undeniable drug dealers. Still, Dennis Hopper's film is unique in other ways. While the editing is not necessarily always fast paced, it tended to be very abrupt. The film contains zero fade-ins, fade-outs, or dissolves, which are pretty much a staple in film editing. Instead, the scenes were at times interjected with clips from the upcoming scene, cutting back and forth between the two before moving on. Admittedly, this was rather bizarre to see at first, but it ended up being a nice change of pace from other directors who were so caught up in making a ""flawless"" film.",Easy Rider

Well, I saw this the week it came out -- ""Easy Bummer"" I called it! -- and it's good to see that so many young people are discovering it (and many other great films from the 60s & 70s; I was just checking out ""The Taking of Pelham 123,"" too!), as it (et al) should be mandatory/desired viewing for everyone who loves films... and the America that we thought it was... for awhile, anyway (until JFK, RFK,& MLK were offed)! Of course, it's not a great story per se, but it is an accurate reflection that (fairly large) subculture and of what a majority of Americans felt -- and still do -- towards ""hippies"" and/or others who are considered ""undesirable"" by virtue of the fact that they simply march to a different drummer or lifestyle or political/religious opinion or p.o.v.... like believing in true freedom and what our Founding Fathers intended! Yes, it's a leisurely paced film...these guys were drug dealers (which most hippies were not), but they were MJ stoners, so that's an accurate reflection of their (desired) casual road trip, as is their passiveness in the face of abuse. Pretty much every film fan knows about ""The Graduate,"" ""Midnight Cowboy,"" The Godfather,"" ""Taxi Driver,"" ""Star Wars,"" ""Jaws,"" ""Network,"" and many other great films of that era... but here are a some more to check out:""The Taking of Pelham 123"" (1974) (Terrific crime thriller!!)

By public request and demand of television it was time to move on from all the censorship and let people make the films they want. Billy and Wyatt represent the film industry after the code because they are two free men just cruising around the country on their motorcycles without a care in the world except for the enormous amount of drug money in their gas tank. Overall this film is expressing the rising hippie and drug movement which moved a lot of people because at the time this film sparked the New Hollywood era of films.

242,colinpsquires,Groovy.,9,11 December 2020,"Dennis Hoppers directorial debut, Easy Rider, was a counter culture fueled journey through the southwest of the United States. The film follows two hippie-ish motorcyclists as they ride from L.A. to New Orleans and maneuver the social landscape of 1960's America. The biker duo is played by Peter Fonda as ""Wyatt"" and Dennis Hopper as ""Billy"". Easy Rider is definitely a product of it's time for the films 1969 release, as it embodies themes of rebellion, drugs, sex, ""hippie culture"", and freedom. This film does a great job of showing freedom from varying perspectives as well as the true cost of freedom or simply living a life outside the established society. This story feels very natural, this is in part due to the beautiful scenery, awesome music, and the laid back demeanor of the films featured duo. The song selection for Easy Rider alone is enough to authentically convey the films authentic rebellious, yet peaceful tone. Peter Fonda's performance is genuinely convincing and was probably one of the chief examples of what being ""cool"" looked like in the early 70's. Hopper was equally as convincing as Fonda's partner in crime and Jack Nicholson delivers on one of the films most enjoyable characters, lawyer George Hanson. There are some rather wacky transition to be found throughout the film, but it personally didn't effect my viewing of the film, if anything it only contributed to the films realism considering the amount of drugs consumed throughout it's duration. I enjoyed watching this film, it transported me back to the late sixties and provided me with a good sense of the attitudes of the time period. I would highly recommend Easy Rider to everyone who hasn't seen the film or has avoided it. Overall I feel there is some imperfect perfection to be found here and a pureness few other films can successfully replicate.",Easy Rider
243,crimsonsanctuary,awesomeeeee,9,16 May 2010,"This is a movie that people have had a hard time enjoying and a hard time explaining. At first I couldn't make much sense of what I had just seen. But I ended up realizing and understanding what this film was about. It's about all of the changes that are going on in the world, in the united states, and the desire to be one with nature again. Also the message of freedom and the lack of it during the '60's in the U.S.. I thought this movie was absolutely amazing. The film used the two main motorcycle riding characters to represent an entire generation while representing the traditional folk who the cyclists were raised by with representation from every person the cyclists meet along their way to their destination. The people that they meet throughout the journey though not only represent the previous generation, but they also represent the resistance to change that many established generations have felt. They feel that when the youth are attempting to change society for the better or worse. This ability to represent tradition and change and their constant conflict between each other is what makes this movies message and morals absolutely unforgettable and still great to watch over 30 years later.",Easy Rider
244,jephiachantharath,The surreal outlook of American in the late 60's,7,2 October 2013,"This film came to me as nothing more than an average film that had some praise at the time, but has not aged well. But to my surprise this film had quite a bit of material to work with; whether it has aged well I'll determine in the end, and does execute them rather well. I would like to point out one negative I have with the film, which is the main stars. I don't find them quite interesting, and that's rather ironic because ""hippies"" were the symbol for freedom back in the day. That brings up another point; unless I don't know my history very well, I always thought bikers had respect or rather had intimidation over others, but here they're treated in offensive ways from redneck hicks. Perhaps their reputation changed over time. Some of the positives I would list are the camera works, while they're not too complicated or unique, it was made at a time of experimentation with filming and method acting. The fact that real drugs were used whenever the viewer would see narcotics. Notably; and obviously, the best factor for me is the supporting star: Jack Nicolson. For starters I like how he doesn't really ham it up or anything of the sort, he's really just there with our main characters because he also believes that they represent freedom. Which is all the more saddening when he is later killed by some hicks. Also I don't quite understand why in the world anyone would go so far as to beat to death a ""hippie"", were they hated that much? Now the characters I noted before as uninteresting are now sympathetic, because we just saw what happened to one of their friends; who am not sure was a hippie himself, and they're traveling America which is full of people who don't like them. The mere fact that there was at a time an America that was so dark and cruel is disturbing, and that there was; and in some ways still are, people who stood up against ""the man"", and were treated with such disrespect for speaking their own opinion.",Easy Rider

The whole point of Easy Rider is rebellion against everything, against what the older generation tells the younger generation to do and against class i s m and superiority based on whether members of a community hold you in higher esteem than someone else. This movie rebels in the first couple of minutes, and for the rest of the movie, with repeated scenes depicting casual drug use, sex, anti-establishment monologues and POV shots of people seeing as though they are high. The editing, especially, makes the movie, as it makes the iconic scene where they all drop acid in a cemetery and trip for 20 minutes. The movie is all about rebellion, and it rebels in every way it possibly can. It exposes societal issues in every way it can, with bright, clear lighting and straightforward camera angles and tracking shots. It makes the rebellion real.",Easy Rider
246,arthurdaley69,A nice surprise...,7,17 June 2010,"I watched 'Easy Rider' with expectation's of it being dated, clichéd, amateurish and overrated. But I was very wrong to do so. It's just one of those movies that grabs you early on and doesn't let go. Everything moves slowly and yet their sublimely surreal day to day life experience and the fantastic scenery keeps you hooked. Hopper, Fonda & Nicholson combine brilliantly to flesh out what could have been a very bare stark dull story. It's amazing what they managed to come up considering the relatively low budget and their constant very drug addled state! Definitely one for every movie collection. I particularly liked the scenes involving 'locals' who were openly evil with their hostility, fear and hatred of anything non conforming. The tension oozes off the screen in those scenes and it's so markedly different to the scenes involving the mellow laid back yet undeniable wild drifters, Fonda & Hopper. The music is great too.",Easy Rider

Jack Nicholson, the boozing failed lawyer, was my favorite character. When he and Hopper were sitting around the campfire talking about stuff was my favorite part, but that scene ended with Nicholson getting beat to death and the other two being like ""that sucks"" and moving on. There should've been more grieving or retaliation or something, but instead they go to New Orleans and use his hooker card. You would think that the ending of a bad movie is a good thing, but somehow they messed that up too. Horrible ending, made me feel like I wasted 2 hours of my life. Again, I can appreciate it (barely) for its meaning and how it related to the 60's, but it just wasn't for me.",Easy Rider
248,AdemWeldon,Production value suffers.,7,6 April 2004,"(some spoilers)Easy Rider is much more neorealistic in dealing with counterculture bikers who want to find America. Although the concept for the film does come across a tad arrogant (treating America as a wild animal), Hopper's story is still poignant and true. Any exaggerations in characters are attributed to social extremities that all exist someplace. While writing these characters, Hopper and Fonda no doubt transcended some of their existential beliefs into the film. This stipulation yielded some clever improvisation between the rogues. 	The shooting chart is somewhat limited, and this is especially true among the driving sequences. Many camera positions are duplicated (although many times to frame some breathtaking locations). A trendy, but deliberate music score help cover up some of Hopper's shortcuts. Unfortunately, this cycle is never broken. The swimming and hallucination montages serve up some interesting editing and sound choices. The bizarre New Orleans graveyard creates a torturous Alice-like-fall' into Wonderland. 	The use of jump cuts, even as a method of foreshadowing the climax is truly pioneering. The fading camera from the demolished bike constantly warns (unjustly) that America has no room for their kind', (whatever that means).Paints a thoughtful portrait.*** (of ****)",Easy Rider

First of all, it was totally off the charts when it came to the factor of uniqueness. It was super rebellious for its time, even for today. The ""trippy"" editing effects made it seem like I was right there doing drugs with them. The nudity, drugs, money, open road and bad guys all combined to make this an out of the ordinary film.

Dennis Hopper wears a hat which may well look cool but I can't say I fancy his chances in the event of a road traffic accident. More sensibly, the other chap wears a helmet which should prevent serious neck and head injuries if the worst comes to the worst. Jack Nicholson wears a crash-helmet (which is good), but no protection on the rest of his body (the other two are sensibly attired in leather) which could lead to serious cuts and abrasions if he is involved in a collision with a small car, for instance.All of this is neither here nor there however because both Hopper and the other one end up being shot (should have been wearing kevlar lads ... though in the case of Hopper, we're still staring down the barrels of a broken neck).I have no idea what happens to Nicholson because the phone rang and he'd gone by the time I got back, but if his recklessness on the back of a Harley Davidson is anything to go by, I wouldn't be entirely surprised to find he spent the rest of his life on a different set of wheels.",Easy Rider

But now I do. Now that I've actually seen the film, I understand completely...This counter-culture masterpiece embraces ideals, expressions and feelings that simply were not (and still today are not) generally revealed in Hollywood movies. Feelings of freedom and life and standing out whilst everyone else sits afraid, of going for that 'big score' to find out how you to want to live your life and of defiantly standing your ground against the established order. The great majority of this is successfully expressed through Hopper's debut direction. It is at times I feel clunky and overtly stands out as work that is inexperienced, but despite that it matches the tone and messages that should be conveyed within the work almost perfectly. The iconic and tragic ending came as a total surprise to me. Not for a long time have I been so shocked by the ending of a film that I sat staring in complete silence at the screen until the song ended and the DVD reverted back to the menu. A great film with amazing spiritual and physical values that leaves me with no doubts why it did indeed influence and inspire many more works that came after it.",Easy Rider

You'll do well to make sure, as I did, to check Easy Rider's Wikipedia page before watching it so you can actually understand the plot. Besides that, and with the exception of Nicholson, acting in this movie is just a sad bunch of murmurs and drug usage. The only two positive aspects of this film are its driving sequences (that were constantly being interrupted by the film's plot) and its soundtrack.I know this movie is considered to be an American classic, but from the point of view of someone who only wished to kill some spare time, I really can't see its value.",Easy Rider

I suppose his ""awakening"" has been played to death by hundreds of subsequent movies and now seems trite and tedious.The LSD trip part was disappointing compared to The Trip. I dropped acid few times back in the 60's but my experience was filled with laughter not darkness and misery. Makes me wonder who was the technical advisor on this sequence.I was also a motorcycle rider back then and knew at least a couple of guys who copied Fonda's tank paint job.

Along the way, they encounter various other elements of society, from the small town conservatives to hippies in a commune, which aids in showing the clash of culture during the era.Being a low budget film, it goes without saying that they used actors who were mostly unknown at the time. They also employed various locals to play roles in the film. Peter Fonda leads the duo as Captain America. Dennis Hopper does what he does best, plays a weirdo. A young Jack Nicholson makes an appearance as an out of place alcoholic lawyer.The cinematography during the characters acid trip is wonderful.

Don't trust anyone over 30, remember? The story centers around the two as they motorcycle from LA to New Orleans in search of ""America"" and their experiences along the way, some not so pleasant. And of course, Jack Nicholson in somewhat of a breakout role for him, is great as the sot lawyer they pick up along the way. Interesting musical score with various artists of the period.

First I was just sitting around, and I noticed it has another message. There's another message in this movie some don't spot right off, I'll let you find it for yourself.I wasn't expecting too much from it because I heard it was just a crazy party movie and we've all heard the ""it's just two guys biking"" film. No, don't listen to that crap, it's something else. I wouldn't upright and say it's just a stoner film, but I say this because they were stoned writing it, directing it, and filming it, so go figure. It was excellent. Don't listen to people saying how simple it is. Out of the 100 minutes, only 10 were spent on the bikes. Watch it.The plot is simple, two hippies find a bag of coke and go cell it to some guy at an airport in LA. It's a cameo by Phil Spector who produced Let It Be. So with this money they decide to stuff it into their gas tanks and take it off to Key West. On the way, they show the good sides of America, the peaceful, and the morally corrupt south.The acting was superb. I love it! Peter Fonda really showed his rebellious side in this. Dennis Hopper was very upbeat in the movie. He wasn't the best of the film except when he was angry. But with all the hardships, the drug paranoia, and all of the big events going on in America, Dennis Hopper really brought this film forewards. It was his most impressive job.This movie isn't one of those movies that just pulls you in and wont let go, it's just peaceful. YOu'll learn some lessons about how things were.

261,heero_yuy2,A simple good movie,10,20 August 2005,"1969 had been one of those years excelling in the time of inventive movie-making (inventing the NC-17 rating. hehe.) With some of the movies such as Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid, Midnight Cowboy, Costa-Gavras' Z, Goodbye, Mr. Chips, and They Shoot Horses, Don't They?. But there is one movie that made Hollywood flop its concept of majestic movie-making to simpler, good, low-budget storytelling concepts nobody had made that impact so strong and so envied to date......it was Easy Rider.The story tells about 2 bike hikers Fonda and Hopper, with their budget money traded from drug-selling, cross-countrying their adventures in the long highways of America, come what they may encounter, not freakin' out. Meeting country families, hippie tents in the middle of the desert, small towns who thought they were a threat or a throne,sex and drugs, and even meeting a haywired lawyer, all mixed up in a bag that simply tells what freedom does mean along the way.It's too good a movie. Excellent backdrops of different types of music hovering along the vast background of America's natural beauty...highly contrasted with the natural instincts of certain Americans met along the way. A place so damn great marred by a somewhat ""wrong civilization"". I'd never thought of that idea for a story concept. Very inventive. I do not say it relates to it's present situations of hippie culture by that time...but the elements that made the place seem entertaining. Nothing of politics or more intelligent form of story, just plain 'meet along the way' naturally (it's a funny thing they included the 'alien' concept as told by Jack Nicholson's funny role).A must for movie collectors to keep AND watch.

265,ilvatz,counterculture exemplified,9,13 May 2012,I found this film to be an amazing glimpse into the generation gap that was being rapidly formed during the time period of this movie. The younger generation was beginning to develop a much different view on the world than their predecessors and starting to question institutions they had been told their whole life were unquestionable. The story follows two young bikers who are travelling across the country selling drugs and wandering with no particular goal in life other than to have a good time. They end up joining up with an alcohilc lawyer whom they introduce to the ways of their culture and in the end it ends up killing him indirectly. Although this movie was not as polished as it could have been i feel that the roughness added to rather than detracted from the character of the film. It gave it a gritty feel which perfectly matched with the lifestyles of the main characters. I found the ending when all of the characters are killed to be a deeply disturbing yet also intensely accurate portrayal of the mindset of the time. Change was to be feared and suppressed because change bred conflict. The only criticism i can possibly give this movie was that the dialogue at times got somewhat static. I found the acid trip scene to be the most appealing visually as the chaos and intensity of that scene perfectly portrays ones mind on lsd.,Easy Rider
266,dlaferriere,summary,1,2 February 2006,"To me Easy Rider was a lot like an old western movie. I saw many similarities relating the two. The basis of the movie was traveling across country like they did in the old west, the only thing different was that they were traveling from West to East in Easy Rider instead of East to West like in the old western days. They were in search of a new life just like the cowboys used to be. Traveling around in search of a new better thing, which was the way of the west and that was the way of Wyatt and Billy in Easy Rider.The first big relationship that I saw between a western and Easy Rider was the campfire scenes. The first night on their trip they set up camp out in the woods and they are talking like they are cowboys. They talk between each other saying that they feel like cowboys out in the west fighting off Native Americans and animals to survive. This is the way the cowboys lived. They traveled all day and then gathered around the campfire at night and talked. That is the same thing Billy and Wyatt did, travel all day and camp out at night.The next big relationship is the way they are looked down upon when they come into new towns. When Billy and Wyatt get into town they go to the diner and when they walk in all the people are afraid of them, so they put them down and threaten them. The townspeople feel offended by their presence and they want them gone because they are something out of the ordinary. It was the same way in westerns, the cowboys came into town and everyone was intimidated by them and wanted them gone. The only people that were interested with both Billy and Wyatt and the cowboys are the girls of the town. The girls want something new and accept them in because they are attracted to them. This also makes the other townspeople even madder because the women like them more. Then the newcomers end up getting beat up or attacked in some other manner. This also happened in Easy Rider. The boys left town but the townspeople caught up to them and beat them with bats. So that is why there is a relationship between the townspeople in both westerns and Easy Rider.There were also a few minor similarities and symbols to relate Easy Rider to westerns. One similarity was when Billy and Wyatt got to the cult in the desert Billy was play shooting with the kids. In the westerns the kids would pretend shoot with the cowboys and Billy was doing the same because the kids saw them as outsiders and wanted to play with them. One of the symbols I saw was that when Wyatt had to change his bike tire, at the same time the cowboy behind him was changing the shoe on his horse. I thought this just showed that they were like cowboys because it was relating the two modes of transportation to each other. Overall I thought Easy Rider was just like a western movie because it had the same plot line with many similarities between the two.",Easy Rider
267,kwalsh2-1,What happened to the American Dream,6,2 February 2006,"The beginning of Easy Rider can easily be compared to the meaning behind the movie. Everything is fuzzy with close-up shots. There is no opportunity to see what the bigger picture is until the end of the shot. However, from the start Hopper had a vision and a significant design for each scene and action. After the successful cocaine sale that ended up financing their journey, Wyatt throws his watch away showing us how he no longer needs to keep time within this universe. He is going to be free, and is on the road for his freedom. From the start these travelers are laid back liberals with few concerns having to do with society. However, as their whereabouts are less familiar to them they experience the genuine prejudice against the far west culture. The residents of these towns are full of hatred for the long-haired men with their freedom.It appears that the protagonists of Easy Rider are Wyatt and Billy. However, their philosophy of life seems to be the only acceptable notion within this movie. They are even-tempered understanding men who are just along for the ride. While they respect the man who tills his own land to survive, they display opposite actions for their own lives. The American Dream used to be a desire for the wealthy of the land to come about from working hard on the land they called home. Meanwhile, Wyatt and Billy are not contributing anything positive to society by making their wealth through a successful cocaine sale and taking off on a journey full of drugs and laziness. This does not make the ending appropriate in any way, but it provides a view into the ""redneck"" hatred of their way of life.The ending is not entirely shocking but it is depressing. After Wyatt believes that they ""blew it"" the viewers recognize that they failed in their mission. From there, the only logical step is for them to be murdered by a redneck. Once the awareness of their failed mission hits them, they succumb to the fact that a different way of life is necessary for their survival, but since they are so deep into their current lifestyle, death becomes a ""way out"". The fact that their assassin was a redneck does not necessarily mean that their way of life surpassed the far western attitude. Instead, the movie demonstrates another theme within the context of the movie, the cause of their anger toward Wyatt and Billy. The best way to explain this hatred would be through the lyrics that the movie provided in the song towards the end, ""It's Alright Ma (I'm Only Bleeding)"".""For them that must obey authority/ that they do not respect in any degree/who despise their jobs, their destinies/Speak jealously of them that are free/cultivate their flowers to be/nothing more than something to invest in.""",Easy Rider
268,gleebs75,Ignorance Kills Freedom,10,2 February 2006,"Easy Rider is a film that is based on the hippie ideas of freedom. It is an incredibly powerful movie when you view it in these terms.

Throughout the film they are faced with different elements of discrimination against them purely because of how they were dressed and how they looked. This fact is introduced early on in the film when they try to go to a low-rate motel to get a room and the ""No"" on before the ""Vacancy"" is lit up as soon as they ask for a room.Billy and Wyatt are constantly portrayed as kind of new age cowboys throughout this film. With motorcycles in place of horses, these two biker hippies cut across the Western plains, complete with brilliant sunsets and scenery. The photography in this film is gorgeous and says a lot of Hopper as a director. The scenes where the two men (eventually three men, since Jack Nicholson eventually joins the two of them) are riding through the land are usually accompanied by rock and roll music. The music is vital to the vibe of the filmit encompasses the freedom that the characters feel riding through the countryside, smoking pot and just digging life. The music represents them and they represent what the music stands for as well.What I took to be the film's turning point was the scene where George (Jack Nicholson) and Billy are discussing hippie culture and their ideals, mainly freedom. George is trying to explain to Billy that to the majority of the population at this time, freedom is dangerous and frightening. They see Billy and Wyatt and get scaredthey don't like to admit that there could be a freedom such as the one that Billy and Wyatt and the hippie culture represent, because that would mean admitting that they aren't free individuals either. This seems to be the point of the filmthe freedom that Billy and Wyatt were after and represented posed a threat to the rest of society, and it is for this reason that most of the people they interact with in the film have an animosity towards them. After hearing this, it does not seem surprising that the three get beaten in the middle of the night, that George is killed, that they are constantly discriminated against, or that ignorant farmers in a one-horse town kill the two free men at the end. Although they were, in fact, polite and upstanding people (with the exception of the coke deal and the pot smoking), the ignorant people of the towns that they went to never gave them a chance and instead judged them to be trouble makers and rowdy newcomers. In essence, they were killed for having more freedom and individuality than American society at the time allowed.",Easy Rider
269,John-304,Love it or hate it.... It was real....,10,15 March 1999,"When I was 20, this film enjoyed a very long run at our local cinema. I must have seen it at least once a week. What was appealing about it was the angst. I feared the same demise as the heroes. Why?Because despite the unreal quality of the movie when seen from a 1999 point of view, it was all very real. It tells of a time when, ""My Country right or wrong"" was the saying of a day, when many of America's youth were lost and trying to find their way. I know, because while I am not American, I had many friends who were and I visited the US several times, each time getting hassled about my long hair, by people on the street. My friends were living in Canada to avoid dying in a corrupt ""Police Action"" overseas.Unlike Bill Clinton, we and the characters in this movie did inhale, mostly to get away from the ugliness that was the political and international situation at the time, remember this was three years before the American Tiananmen Square, Kent State. So our two heroes, a ""Hippie"" and a ""Greaser"" went looking for America and found it..... Scary, eh?That was the appeal of this movie and still is, because not much has changed.Think I'll go out and buy a copy....",Easy Rider
270,stuartmcgill-87737,Great road movie...,8,19 September 2019,"Kinda nothing happens here..... It is very much a sort of mood piece.... I suspect the use of drugs would enhance this.....

271,dustin_abraham,Hippies Use Side Door,8,30 June 2003,"I think this film is an American masterpiece...to me it's actually not overly entertaining, it just says so much and so little at the same time. I never liked hippies, but this movie emphasizes how poorly America treats people who are different and it made me appreciate the counterculture movement much more. The really ironic part of the movie is how Wyatt was nicknamed Captain America and had his chopper all decked out in red, white, and blue. While watching this film, I really wanted them to retaliate and kick some redneck butt, but that wouldn't have made the film as strong as it is. I really liked Jack Nicholson in this film...he added some comic relief and he drinks Jim Beam in a pint bottle just like I always do. Combine all of that with a mean soundtrack and excellent photography direction and you get a film that everyone should see, especially young people. The documentary on the making of the film is very interesting...if you like this movie and don't own it yet, go buy the DVD, the documentary is on there.",Easy Rider
272,CAOP,Very Over-rated Film,5,16 February 2003,"I think this is just a timepiece movie.  Watching it in 2003, nothing about it stands up.  I didn't care at all about the charcaters.  I didn't care at all about the hippie's struggles with local hillbillies (EVERY rural local was portrayed as borderline evil).  I didn't care about their free love or their drug use.  I didn't care about anything anyone had to say.  If this movie was made in 2003, I don't many people would like it.",Easy Rider
273,phoenixeast,A good Revelation,8,21 November 2004,"1969 was the year I was born. Being a gen-xer I am often sick of listening to classic rock music and dealing with baby boomer culture. As I watched this movie I cringed a bit when I saw the old fashions. But this was all before I saw the commentary. According to the commentary easy riders was the first movie that really showed the counter culture as it was - not the stereotypical pollyanna ideal American youth that older generations wanted to portray. Now I really understand the cultural significance of this movie and I am glad I saw it. I also have noted how the characters did not have any idea about the consequences of drug use. Some of those same stereotypes are still the same today as they are 35 years ago. This film showed a commune, the hippie wandering spirit, the marijuana and the mentality of wanting to reconnect with the earth. You can still see this mentality today in seniors who were strongly influenced by this form of thinking and when you visit an area like Woodstock, New York or Parts of the San Francisco Bay area and Northern California. In addition, it was good to see where some of the songs I STILL hear on classic radio stations first came out. The scenery was just breathtaking. I really have to give them credit for capturing all they did. The only part I did not appreciate was near the end when they were all on what appeared to be lsd and the scenes all made no sense. I got the point early on and just wished that it had been significantly shortened. I would highly recommend this to people over 18. It is without a doubt one of the best films to capture the consciousness of an era that influences the present.",Easy Rider
274,militon,Bikes Drugs And Rock'n'Roll,7,17 April 2008,"Before anything else, I have to make one thing clear. This is not a bad movie. I could really relate to the characters. but the fact that it's a low budget movie really shows. and at times it shows in a way that bothered me. obviously nobody's fault. In fact, hats off to the creators of this movie, for what they managed to accomplish with limited funding (in fact, I don't know if this is really a low budget movie, I just assumed after seeing it it was. regardless, I gave it a 7 because of it's overall value. I'm not an adept of adapting my rankings to the budget of the movie) Another thing about this movie - the clichés. The cool, laid back dude paired with the restless, motivated dude, the drugs that, eventually, end up screwing things up (drugs are bad, mk? so don't do drugs, mk? cause drugs are bad, mk?), the choppers (themselves a cliché. don't think there's anyone who would ride across America on one of those), the hippie-hating rednecks, etc. perhaps at the time some of these were not yet clichés, I don't know. What really saves the movie, in my opinion, is the acting. Exceptional acting, in my opinion. I've seen quite a few movies about drugs, but I have to say I don't think I ever saw getting high so well portrayed so well. And I'm not talking about one of the guys, either. I'm talking about all of them. Almost makes me wonder if they weren't actually high. Then there's also something you don't see everyday in a low budget movie. A second layer. There's a little resentment there, especially from captain America, under all his cool, there's jack's character who's more than first meets the eye, and more. All in all, a movie I would watch again, but not more than once. A solid 7 in my book.",Easy Rider
275,krisztyxx,The last culture and double faced America,8,8 February 2017,"The Easy rider a movie about freedom, motorcycle culture and hippy lifestyle. Nowadays all lost. Have many motorcycle gang, guys how to travel around with motorcycle, but don't exist that way anymore, when existing in late the 69s and the 70s. The world is changing. The whole hippy culture disappeared, and the people forgot. On the other hand, someone tries to re-back this lifestyle, this feeling, but this culture never the same, these people are lost. Never the same, because people now can't do this which the hippies did. They can't speak, like the hippies, they lost that kind of voice, ice, they lost the rebel spirit. Now., they agree lots of things wherewith a hippy never agree with. The movie superbly captures the lifestyle of these guys, this motorcycle guys whose life his own life, don't care other people opinion. On the other side live the people, who think, live different and frightened. They frightened and jealous because they can't choose this life, but in deep inside them, they want, but on the surface, they can't. American culture and life have a double face. On one side said: America is a free country you want to be who want to be. You are free, we accept you no matter who you are or what you re-present. On the other side has the deep bigoted religiousness and they said we one to be everybody the same. If you are different we can't accept you. We one to follow us because of our way the good way. The movie gives us a good re-presentation of this duality. I thought this is an underrated movie even with two Oscars nomination. The Easy rider adheres to culture and feeling which was lost today.",Easy Rider
276,jcoolum,Modern Classic,7,2 February 2006,"The film Easy Rider is one of the most influential films of the 1960s. Peter Fonda, the son of famed actor Henry Fonda, and his friend, Dennis Hopper conceived an idea for a new kind of western. Everyone knows the quintessential westerns with such actors as John Wayne and Tom Mix. The idea Fonda and Hopper had was to make a western set in the modern era was that the new ""cowboys"" were ""bikers"" and ""motorcycles"" were the new ""horses."" The film was about a pair of ""hippies"" who tread across America coming off a huge drug deal. They simply want to settle down and ""retire"" in Florida. On the way, they meet many people, including fellow hippies and a lawyer played wonderfully by Jack Nicholson. They also meet many people who don not like them based on their lifestyle. These people are prejudice against Wyatt (Peter Fonda) and Billy (Dennis Hopper) because they consider them ""hippies."" Eventually this prejudice leads to their end. They are shot down by passing ""rednecks"" who do not like them due to their ""hippie"" lifestyle.The film shadows Arthur Penn's Bonnie & Clyde (1967) in ways because the main characters are portrayed as good but, in the end, they are killed by members of society who do not understand and do not wish to understand their lifestyle. The rebellious nature of Bonnie Parker and Clyde Barrow resonate out of Wyatt and Billy. The audience gets the impression that these rebellious youths are misunderstood by the rest of society. The film also has a fair amount of drug use in it. The two protagonists are always smoking marijuana and immediately at the beginning of the movie the audience sees them snorting cocaine. There is even a very strange sequence shot when the characters and their hired prostitutes decide to take LSD. The sequence is shot all mumbled and jumbled to portray to the audience how the drug affects a person. This theme of drug use in the film represents the times in which it is set.The times in which the film was made also had an effect on how Fonda, Hopper, and Terry Southern wrote the story. The late 1960s were trying times for Americans. The Vietnam War was at its height, the country had just come off the loss of their president, John F. Kennedy, in 1963. In April 1968, Martin Luther King, Jr. was shot in Memphis. There was a state of confusion in those years all around America. Later, when he was running for office, Robert F. Kennedy was killed in the kitchen of a hotel after making a speech. This was a time when things were hectic and out of place which really shows through in the film. The flagrant disregard for authority in the film reflects the rebellious nature of the people in the country. Wyatt and Billy die for what seems to be no reason at all. This also represents the needless deaths of John Kennedy, Martin Luther King, Robert Kennedy, along with the thousands over in Vietnam. The two characters are rather martyred at the closing of the film. Easy Rider presents Wyatt and Billy as righteous cowboys cut down at a young age because of prejudice. They feel as though they are truly free while society looks down upon them. Wyatt, throughout the film, is very optimistic while Billy always seems to be paranoid. The irony is that Wyatt is too optimistic and Billy proves to be correct in his feelings of paranoia. Easy Rider is a very well done and successful movie that has become an instant classic. It will not soon be forgotten.",Easy Rider
277,neeleythezombie,incredibly interesting representation of the youth,10,12 May 2010,"i thought this movie was absolutely amazing. the film used the two main motorcycle riding characters to represent an entire generation while representing the traditional folk who the cyclists were raised by with representation from every person the cyclists meet along their way to their destination. the common folk that they meet throughout the journey though not only represent the previous generation, but they also represent the resistance to change that many established generations have felt whenever the youth are attempting to change society for the better (or sometimes worse). this ability to represent tradition and change and their constant conflict between each other is what makes this movies message and morals timeless.",Easy Rider
278,tpion,Don't Bogart That Joint My Friend,10,2 February 2006,"The movie Easy Rider which was made in 1969 and directed by Dennis Hopper who was not only the director but also one of the two main characters. The other main character is played by Peter Fonda who along with Hopper wrote the script to the movie Easy Rider. Peter Fonda plays a ""Captain America"" type of guy, his bike along with his helmet are painted the colors of the American flag, and his leather jacket he wears has a flag sewn into the back of it. Dennis Hopper on the other hand plays more of a hippy role, with his long flowing hair and by the way he dresses we can see a total difference between the two characters. Though these two characters are different they are both on a journey together to travel over the country to experience what real ""freedom"" was. The only thing they had with them were there hot rod bikes and all there money which was hidden in Wyatt's gas tank. One of the strangers that these two encountered along the way was famous actor Jack Nicholson. Jack played a man by the name of George Hansen who is a lawyer who seems to have a very clear drinking problem. They meet up with him when they get thrown in jail for riding their motorcycles through a parade in the streets of the town they were riding through. From there they go through a series of events which ends up leading to the death of George Hansen (Nicholson). Once Hansen was beaten to death by the town locals who had been hassling them earlier was almost the start of the beginning of the end for the two travelers. The end of the movie comes when the two of them are riding their bikes along the back roads when a couple of ""hicks"" decided to try and scare them by pointing their shotgun at them. Hopper doesn't even budge but instead gives them the finger, which then leads to him being shot while still riding his bike. Wyatt who was played by Peter Fonda then goes to get help for his dieing buddy. Though he never makes it because the ""hicks"" so to speak doubled back and as he was going one way they were going the other and shot and killed him as well. Throughout the whole movie I kept pondering in my head what is freedom? And what is freedom in America and will they find it. In the end I don't they did find freedom even though they went all over the country they still were put down or oppressed. They were ridiculed and made fun of at the diner, beaten while they were sleeping because they were different from the locals. Though maybe the freedom they were looking to find was the open road, the way you feel when it's just you and your bike cutting through the air like a knife through warm butter. Maybe freedom for them was the ability to go and do whatever they wanted when they wanted to.",Easy Rider
279,rhall-14,Riding for Freedom,7,3 February 2006,"This film, directed by Dennis Hopper found its roots in the ideas of the hippie movement of the late 1960's, about the concepts of freedom and love. Ironically, the film came out onto the scene in 1969 as the hippie movement was dividing and losing strength in the country. Easy Rider is a very unique picture and was a key film in the advancement of the American film industry in the late 60's. One way to delve into this movie in a more precise way would be to focus on the idea of the American dream of freedom and how it is discussed and represented in this film specifically by the characters Wyatt, Billy and George.This idea of freedom is seen early and often in the movie. After Wyatt and Billy purchase and sell the drugs, and begin their journey across the country to the warm area of Florida, they make their first interaction with a family that lives on a farm, who live and survive off the land. Even though Wyatt and especially Billy (who begins eating before grace is spoken, and with his hat still on) feel out of place with this family, Wyatt makes a comment, saying how proud the father should be of his family and the way he is living his life. It appears as if Wyatt has seen his first example of what it is like to live the American dream of freedom, which appears to be what he is striving and looking for throughout the movie.Later, after picking up the hitchhiker and bringing him to his commune by the canyon, Wyatt gets his second glimpse of the American dream. The people living in this place are trying to distance themselves from the metropolitan areas, living of the land like the farmer's family. However, although they have less luck, Wyatt seems more drawn to their way of life. One girl, who seems very interested in Wyatt (she even calls him ""beautiful"") implies that she wants him to stay there, and the hitchhiker they pick up also wants him to stay. However, Wyatt still wishes to explore America, to find more meaning in this country that he lives in.Unfortunately, as Wyatt and Billy move away from that place and continue further south and east they move farther away from their dream. They are treated unfairly and with prejudice when they are arrested for riding their motorcycles in a parade (""parading without a license"") and further south they are ridiculed, beat up and eventually killed by conservative southerners. In the campfire scene before George Hanson is killed, George and Billy have a conversation about their country and what has gone wrong with it. Although Wyatt keeps quiet during this scene, the conversation seems to say what Wyatt believes. Billy is upset about how they are being treated by Southerners, and George tells him it is because they represent freedom and equality, which is something that southerners are scared of.Later, after George's death and after Wyatt and Billy have left Mardi Gras and have made it to Florida, the two have one last conversation around a campfire. Billy tells him that they have done it, completed their task because they are rich and have made it across the country. But Wyatt responds by telling Billy that they ""blew it"". This line is debated over its meaning, but it seems to mean that the reason behind the hippie movement has been lost; that Wyatt and Billy and the others involved in this movement have blown it because these other areas of the country are still filled with hate. Of course, this is made even more clear when they are killed by the rednecks in the pickup truck in the conclusion of the film.Easy Rider is an impressive film, one that is mostly driven by the need for the fulfillment of the American dream. Billy is searching for it in terms of wealth and retirement in a tropical place. Captain America (Wyatt) is looking for it in terms of a realization and a completion of what the hippie movement set out to accomplish. In the end the two fail at gaining this as they are shot down by rednecks who portray the opposite of the love and equality that Wyatt was searching for all along.",Easy Rider

In there with others like Cuckoo's Nest, Clockwork Orange and the totally historically inaccurate Dances With Wolves. There is not one character in this waste of film who isn't a total low-life with no redeeming qualities. The leads are drug smugglers and all the people they meet on their journey are no better than them. They range from drunks to prostitutes to vicious rednecks who end the run of the drug dealers.

281,ZIrwin,Road Trip,7,19 December 2012,This movie shows off the Grittiness of new Hollywood in a good way with opening scenes that are edgy such as the main characters doing cocaine in the opening scenes. the disappointing part of this movie is that the most interesting character played by Jack Nicholson dies not long after he is brought into the story. This is a powerful look at the views of groups that were vastly different parts of society and shows what each of them were about. for example it shows that small town people aren't racist their in fact just pretentious people unwilling to accept change and want to protect what they care about. It shows this holds true in other groups depicted in the movie. IT is also impacted by its lack of a defined plot or conflict.,Easy Rider

(Get a load of cash and just live) it shows other ideas that come from the american dream which is live of the land and be free.It also show why the american dream really is just an illusion; the man who married his catholic wife and lived of the land in his own farm was once a young man who dreamed about california and the young citykids who left their city life to live of the land tried to grow crops in the sand and were starving in the winte, some of the smalltown folk were really never free.
And they all live of the land which indians are buried beneath because once it was their american dream.The film has a lot of foreshadowing which feels appropiate, because we always want to feel positive and keep dreaming despite the warnings and omens of life. It is written in a great and unpredictable way despite the foreshadowing.The perfomances and directing is good but at times quite trippy which I understand is not for everyone but the film is still a strong viewing anyway for those who aren't.

This is a timeless movie and in my opinion even more true now than ever. I have spent quite a bit of time in the USA and must say that Easy Rider is a perfect microcosmic metaphor of what is happening in the country now. If you are a US citizen you must try and watch this movie with a very open mind. Who knows if enough people watch this and similar movies or read books on the subject and sometime in the future will be able to convert the country back to its original values and principles. Beside all this this movie is stuffed with great dialogue (don't  miss the scene where Nicholson, Hopper and Fonda are having a smoke), the characters are instantly likeable, even if you are conservative and the biker image doesn't instantly appeal to you, the drunk lawyer (Nicholson) is seemingly a character which  does not fit in with the other characters yet he does so perfectly.There's much more I could say about this movie but I think you best go out and see it and form your own opinion.

There's a great sense of place and landscape, which you might expect from a movie set mostly outdoors - a real feeling of 'lives in a landscape' among the characters, these are people whose lives have all been defined by their landscape, either in working with it or wanting to fight against it and move away. For the protagonists, being 'from L.A.' makes them objects of fascination or loathing.

I think the best scene of the movie is when Peter Fonda's name is shown on the screen, he looked very cute, very cool with his one handed riding. (2) Definitely the song-Born to be wild.

There is one sequence toward the end that is of Fonda, Hopper and two prostitutes in the haunting above ground cemeteries of New Orleans right after Mardi Gras. They are on acid, going crazy.... the acting is so sincere and unbounded it is frightening.

I know that the people of the generation of New American Cinema stood for a set a values, a collective psyche of Cultural Revolution, a mindset that's become foreign to our present day. When I look at Easy Rider in terms of a commentary of its time, I see a tremendously hopeful story of two friends up against the world, and enjoying every second. Yet you also see those two un-tamed youths brutally slain at the end of the film. They were just two harmless bikers; they smoked some grass, tripped on LSD, whose only goal in life was to have fun. Really, it's this youthful way of life that proved the most difficult to accept for the aging parents of the sixties cultural.Captain America and Billy, Peter Fonda and Dennis Hopper, begin the film by being couriers in a cocaine deal between shady Mexicans and an even shadier Phil Spector portrayed anonymous rich-guy. They decide to take the money from the deal and head for Mardi Gras. Along the way the viewer of the movie is treated to their story, from spending time at a religious convent to meeting a brash young lawyer named George Mason (Jack Nicholson) in a small town in Texas who decides to join them. All throughout the movie the heroes are unwelcome at hotels and restaurants because of their hippie-like appearance. They are subject to slurs and treatment not too unlike the treatment of African Americans in the south. The things they stood for were so reviled that they ultimately lose their lives.The visuals in this film are striking. The montage of Captain America and Billy beginning the journey through the deserts of either Arizona or New Mexico set to songs like Steppenwolf's ""Born to be Wild"" and The Band's ""The Weight"" set a tone of freedom and adventure not unlike the tone in any classic western. Our two leads though, are not moving west like a typical Western movie would have them. Instead they are riding their motorcycles east, in reverse if you will. They embody the same spirit found in the Wild West, yet they in turn are riding machines in reverse of the typical direction. This movie was made at the exact same moment in time that Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and Robert Kennedy were assassinated. There was a lame duck President leading the country in a quagmire of a War in Vietnam, and let's not to forget the ongoing Cold War with Russia. The very things our country had always valued, loaded terms like ""freedom"" and ""liberty,"" intrinsic building blocks of an empire, such as the ability to trust authority, all these things were under attack at this very instant in time. Out of this we see a movie where two innocent counter-culture members are gunned down in cold blood by a couple of true Dixie boys from the good ol' South. It's as direct commentary of it's time as much as any piece of entertainment has ever been. It's both highly entertaining and highly controversial. It's well acted, well directed, and shot beautifully. It has an almost unbelievably effective soundtrack. It's a brilliant film, I feel sorry it took me 22 years to finally see it.",Easy Rider
295,robertfsanchez,"Iconic Film in Cinema History, but.....",5,10 March 2021,"Alright, Easy Rider was a very well made film, and I understand the importance of this movie in film history. It started an era of a time when some of the greatest movies of all time were made. It's a piece of art for sure. Killer soundtrack and A+ cast, but in my opinion that's about it. I didn't find anything interesting in the cinematography compared to the other iconic movies to come before this. The shots of them driving cross country were cool, but they didn't do much for me. Honestly, I couldn't wait for this movie to end. To me, the story line didn't resonate and I didn't connect with any of the characters. I feel bad talking negative of the film given its legacy, but it just wasn't that interesting of a film to me.",Easy Rider
296,patgibbons,Easy riders and easy morals.,7,15 December 2008,"Easy Rider to me, is a film about ignorance and the cataclysmic consequences it can have. The film centres on two characters, both of whom are the quintessential view of a middle-class conservative (American in particular) of what being free (and freedom itself) means, namely, an obnoxious, dope smoking and long-haired lazy drifter. Dennis Hopper's Billy is that very man and a slightly less obnoxious, more-open minded dope smoking, long haired, lazy drifter, or Wyatt, played by Peter Fonda.After a successful drug deal which involves exploiting several hundred Mexicans (no trouble there then, why break the habits of a lifetime), they cast off their obligations (Wyatt's dumping of his watch) and hit the road heading East on a coast-coast bike ride. They compromise their obligations from the get-go by their need of the dollar, for gas and supplies, therefore to be free in the USA you need money, in other words you can't be. Wyatt and Billy as far as being free go, enjoy their own commercially-funded status symbols e.g. their noisy choppers, leather gear and hope to retire in Florida.Tests to their freedom occur frequently, such as their reliance on their bikes and their own complete lack of knowledge in how to fix them. When Wyatt gets a flat, with little more than a patronising acknowledgement to his far more skilled-superior, and ultimately more independent and free man, their flat is fixed and both are fed without charge. Little is made of this but it is surely a critique of the free and wealthy Wyatt and Billy who extend little kindness to their fellow man. Is being free, the freedom to be an obnoxious buffoon, or a selfish, exploitative obnoxious buffoon? One key demonstration of kindness (necessary from a plot development idea, but out of character) is extended to what seems to be a lonely drifter, but is actually the head of a hippie commune. Wyatt and Billy view the commune's surroundings with undisguised contempt, but one of the members of the commune falls in love with Wyatt and offers him (for me anyway) the true concept of freedom, the freedom to be in love and (in my opinion again) our only real freedom in a generally unfree world.Wyatt's later acknowledgement that ""we blew it"" surely refers to this. Wyatt may also recall the fact that he and Billy have enough money to save the commune from certain death (by installing an irrigation system to save the commune's soon-to-die crops), but he was too easily fooled by his money and his greed.My view of this film is clear, Wyatt and Billy are criticised for a narrow-minded view of freedom and even when freedom (the hippie commune) appears in front of them (in the flesh of two pretty women) they don't see it, partly because they are both too stoned and partly because they are too stupid, similarly their ultimate nemeses display similar levels of self-destructive ignorance.Jack Nicholson's character for me is totally out of place in the film. His introduction, stay and departure are really only diversions from the two lead actors and Jack's involvement doesn't even serve to act as a link-man. He appears, tags along and his death does nothing to prevent Wyatt and Billy from travelling on. They don't even appear to go back into town to call the police.About the film techniques, some of the techniques, strange forms of editing are very poorly done and subsequently have no consequence in plot development and are therefore a waste. Much of the film is B-Movie and exploitation-like, the landscapes, the mountains, the people in the cafe, the poor black people waving from their horrible tin huts, the Mardi Gras celebrations and is therefore a movie full of clichés, but the essentially story is powerful and has a phenomenal final 10 minutes, that make for a very watchable film, even today.",Easy Rider
297,yorick-23,Hard To Watch,1,4 April 2011,"I had ""Easy Rider"" on my to-watch-list for a long time, because it's glorified as an all-time-classic. What I saw was a bore. Two long-haired (I love hairy men!) bikers with a hoseful of drug money heading to New Orleans. Not the worst initial position for an entertaining movie. After dragging the plot for no point thru some community disputes, the FIRST EVER INTERESTING CHARACTER IN THIS WHOLE NOTHING ascends: the all-time-drunk-lawyer/Jack Nicholson. AND he gets beaten to death by the all-around rednecks, and while his body grows cold, his hitchs (? sorry; what's the proper term for someone giving a lift to an hitchhiker?) consider (!) ""to send his remains to his relatives"", but simply continue heading to New Orleans instead. Didn't they have some questioning to answer? While the greatest actor of this movie has left the scene so rushly, it must have been other things than acting which made this bore an instant success. Could it have been that LSD-related intercourse on a cemetery? I don't hope so.What's left is that drive-by-shooting by some rednecks, the climax of the movie. Is that what the movie is all about? Being a free spirit, feared and murdered by rednecks? I've seen better movies about that.""Life is a tale told by an idiot, full of sound and fury, signifying nothing."" So are some movies.",Easy Rider
298,zackbutson,A Better by the minute adventure,8,9 June 2010,"My high expectations for this movie were met with disappointment during the first twenty minutes of this movie. But thank god I stuck with it! The style doesn't change after that mark, but for some reason it grasps you. You really appreciate it. A lot of that has to do with OUTSTANDING acting by Peter Fonda, Jack Nicholson, and Dennis Hopper. Hopper especially puts up a fantastic performance in a Lee Marvin esquire role.While the film dives into the relationships and places the two biker buddies encounter on a road to New Orleans, the movie really shines on the journey from stop to stop. The best parts of ""Rider"" are the scenes where the two stars roam the streets through beautiful western locations. The scenes are that much more special due to an outstanding soundtrack.The film making was, however, a little shaky. One problem I had was the over use of the off-and-on ""shutter"" transition from scenes. The multiple angles and takes when picking up the hitch hiker was confusing. But as a director, Hopper did include some great moments including picking the landscape and his work with the LSD scene.At the beginning of the movie you really feel like Fonda and Hopper are going to be stabbing rebels. But as it goes along you experience a revelation and realize they're anything but. You really feel for these characters and in return they make you feel free for 100 minutes. Jack Nicholson also provides some amazing lines, and definitely is responsible for creating a masterpiece moment when discussing UFOs, the scenes strongest scene.",Easy Rider
299,noahkuchenrither,an American classic of its time,8,10 June 2010,easy rider is a special film and it was ground braking for its time. the movie is about two bikers on a journey around America to find a way to live there lives while doing drugs and partying with girls and meeting strange people. Dennis Hopper directed and played his role good in this movie and in the movie Wyatt and billy are always on the move. the ending to this movie well probably ruin the film for people and that's what happened to me. then i took sometime and thought about it and realized that the movie is about freedom and Americas view of freedom. after i realized that it made the ending not ruin it for me and actually made it make seance to me.i am glad that i was able to watch this movie because it taught me more about Americas way of freedom and how it was back then. this was by far one of the best road movies and American movies that i have seen that has a moral to it. my rating: 8/10,Easy Rider
300,gaps77,"Terrible film, drawn out and mostly boring.",2,7 September 2021,"This is a terrible film. I don't normally rag on films, they have to be really bad! I found this an ordeal to watch, the best bit of the story is when the excellent Jack Nicholson comes into it all, but even he wasn't able to elevate this film enough for me to not think it was a dumpster fire!Watch something better, like Quadrophenia or Midsommar, or Peanut Butter Falcon, or Falling Down, or District 9 ... because this film goes down like a fart in a lift!",Easy Rider

302,thekeeth,Freedom does scare the stupid.,10,15 May 2007,"This film is wildly popular with a certain type of person, but it's just as easy to find ""that"" other type of person who can't stand Easy Rider and see nothing positive about it. After watching this film, you will no doubt have realized that there was two main kinds of characters in this story. One was the character that was open minded, tolerant, and accepting of the world. The other type of character was hateful, close-minded, violent, and very scared of character number one and all the things that those kind of characters represent.First off, this is what today we would call an independent film. This movie was very renegade when it came out in the market. This particular DVD has a documentary called ""Shaking the Cage"" inside the extras sub menu. Great documentary, and the title says it all. Hopper and Fonda showed classic American balls by making this movie, and making it in the manner they did. Can you tell whose side I'm on yet? The photography is amazing. All of the road shots in this movie are stunning to look at, and the locations throughout the film are real, gritty, and distinctive. I imagine that even if this film would have had a huge budget, it still would have appeared to be very raw. Hopper obviously wasn't making a fantasy movie here, he crafted a very real story and placed it in the real world. This is a film that is intended to get the audience thinking, get them asking questions, and yes, probably make you a little angry. The activism that was born and raised in the 60's is still there in Hopper and Fonda's creation. These two men have always been involved in what has been called the ""counter-culture"" movement, and I guess this film is what made them household names for doing so.Awesome soundtrack as well, and how could there not be. I own the double CD of this film's soundtrack, and it's just beautiful music to listen to. Again, listening to it makes me think, and it makes me ask questions about my country and my world. In my opinion, anyone who considers themselves a truly free U.S. citizen should be a thinker, and should always have a little skeptic sitting on their shoulder asking questions about what is going on in the world around them.I think this film will stand the test of time as not only an entertaining film, but a fairly accurate historical document that covers a very turbulent and important time in our nation's social history. If for no other reason than to take a glimpse into the late 60's to early 70's, this film is worth watching. You will no doubt find yourself clearly on one side of the fence or the other about Easy Rider, there is no fence sitting. If you like it, it's brilliant, but if you hate it, it's boring hippie garbage. It is what it is.",Easy Rider
303,jridings,One of the worst,1,30 December 2008,"This is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. There can be no spoilers for this movie because it wasn't about anything. It had no plot, no meaning, no nothing -- unless that was the point of the movie, which I guess it was. But making a movie about two pot-heads biking across country is not much of a plot, especially when the characters are so unlikeable. Does anybody care if they run into trouble from rednecks who don't like theses unbathed and unfriendly characters? In order to like this movie, you would have to be as stoned out of your mind as the people who were making it at the time. And even then you can give it only two ""wow man's.""",Easy Rider
304,nsutherland-1,"Oh, it was not an 'easy' ride.",8,3 February 2006,"Nolan Sutherland Special Topics in Film Prof. Niemi 2 February 2005The 1969 film Easy Rider, directed by Dennis Hopper, was released in one of the most tumultuous years of the century, and realizing this helps solidify many of the themes in the movie. At the time, the war in Vietnam was raging on with increasing American casualties, Lyndon B. Johnson was fighting for diplomacy and peace, and the country was engulfed in an all-around state of unrest and chaos. This year truly set the scene for a movie like Easy Rider. It is a story of two bikers, Wyatt (a.k.a. Captain America) and Billy, on a voyage of freedom living out the counterculture lifestyle, and their adventures from the west coast to the streets of New Orleans for Mardi Gras, and eventually Florida.The opening of the film really gets the counterculture ball rolling with a cocaine deal and the rock and roll song ""Pusher Man"". The viewer is thrown right into Wyatt and Billys' lives of rebellion against society and the law, and the freedoms of being a biker. These freedoms include illicit drug use, promiscuity, and the calling of the open road, which are all accented in the movie with songs like ""Born to Be Wild"". As the two are making their way on the road they encounter many distractions, which are anything but that to them. At one point they stop to fix their bikes on a farm and there is a scene that shows, and even compares, the bikers and a couple of farmers/cowboys. This is interesting because it gives insight to the characterization of Wyatt and Billy, which can be inferred as them being modern cowboys. The farmers are shoeing their horse while Wyatt and Billy are tending to their rides, their motorcycles.The boys return to their journey, and along the way pick up a hippie hitchhiker. It is at this point where one can decipher a difference in character between the two bikers. Wyatt completely trusts the hitchhiker with his bike (even though the money stash is in his fuel tank) and believes the hitchhiker will in turn respect him. On the flip, Billy is paranoid of the hitchhiker's intentions and is untrusting. He seems to be a negative product of the hippie idealism, which was due to his freedom and drugs use he has become paranoid and a loose cannon. This reveals that although the two are lumped into the same societal group, they still have their differences. Next, they make their way to a commune where the hitchhiker resides. This part of the movie gives a real insight into the lifestyle of the hippie, and even gives a sense of what life would be like if that lifestyle took over. Wyatt and Billy may be part of the counterculture, but it is illustrated here that the two are not quite hippies, rather just free spirits looking for their true freedom. This contrast between the two groups may seem blurred, but the film evokes a feeling of difference between the two groups that is hard to put into words. The bikers' next temporary companion is George Hanson, whom they meet in jail. Wyatt and Billy end up in the pen because they insert themselves into a town parade, which again outlines their state of mind which is: if we're not hurting anyone, why can't we do it? They end up taking George along with them, and in effect opening him up to their world. George plays the role of bridging the gap between the counterculture and the mainstream of the south, and in turn he gets so caught up in the bikers' lifestyle that it costs him his life. He was the sacrifice of the clash between the two forces. This clash is what ultimately ends Wyatt and Billy's journey. The two mix with the south like oil mixes with water. No matter what, southern traditionalists would never mingle or even accept the two's lifestyle, and this societal polarization would climax with their death. While riding along a road a shotgun is pulled on them by two redneck duck poachers, and the two don't have a chance of even defending themselves. The movies' abrupt ending was done brilliantly, I believe, because Wyatt and Billy were perfectly captured in the movie, and their demise immortalizes the roles they played in 1968.",Easy Rider

The movie is also basically about the glory of drugs and explains why drug use became a major problem in the US: it was a major part of american youth culture in the cities and even among students in the 60s and 70s. The quality of the filming is so low it's amazing it was ever released. The directing seems like its done by a child, or someone on drugs (which is probably closer to the truth). The dialogs are below primitive, amateurish. The relationships are infantile and shallow. The music + bikes explains why it became such a cult movie. But all that really does not make it anything close to a great movie, not even with Henry Fonda.",Easy Rider
309,pokadaughts,Easy Rider: American Spirits,10,3 March 2000,"Easy Rider is a complex film. The American spirit is exemplified by Billy and Wyatt, who differ from their legendary, century- old wild-west prototypes only by the change from wild horseback riding to wild motor biking-  the hair-raising is about the same, minus firearms. America in the nineteen sixties is the setting for this tale of outlaws who care little for anyone but themselves, and whose scruples are few and far-between, their human connections sparse yet earthy. They are outlaws who harm no one, a mythical model of an America that youth want to see and hear about, especially in a decade which was undergoing major cultural shifts, with considerable debate surrounding the concept of nonviolence versus the need for revolutionary justice being particulary strong among those who were politically or even intellectually active in that tumultuous time.  The rough, independent, freedom, the alienation from roots, the Westward movement(in this case south eastern,) looking for a place to put down roots yet not wanting to stay put and to instead keep searching for adventure, for whatever gives one's life meaning, the sense of being a visitor passing through, - that represents the American spirit is captured on film before our eyes, and is subsequently shattered by the very forces that call themselves representatives of the Law. The implications of this tragic, losing battle will have the George Hansons of this world still reeling with justifiable indignation at this darker side of  society's misunderstanding of what it really means to be an American and a seeker of happiness, human dignity, individuality of thought and lifestyle,  and the Dream.   The film resembles,for good reason , not an American, Hollywood movie, but more of an avante-garde Art film, with its careful, innovative camera work and editing, with particular attention played to fitting popular,  now-classical rock to moving images and rounding out the characters and their psychological states, partially ad-libbed scenes, sparse dialogue, post-Method, superrealistic acting, and intricate, symbol-dotted composition of shots and scenes. Issues such as independence, freedom, alienation, generational as well as cross-cultural(counter- vs traditional-) conflict  and friendship are portrayed sensitively and with a fresh, but lasting uniqueness and artistic awareness that had never-to-fore been accomplished in Hollywood. The sixties had relatively little to do with why this film is a classic; it was simply the backdrop, brilliantly used as a framework by Director Dennis Hopper, and writers Hopper, Fonda and Southern to cinematically create a fine work of art that will last much more than a generation, and has reached much farther than their own shores in communicating classic themes as well as  new themes in an entirely new light.",Easy Rider

This film is a perfect example of society and how it is always changing. It also takes a bit of exploration into the bad side of psychedelic's which is portrayed very well on screen, especially for it being 1969 and not having the special effects that we do today. Jack Nicholson, Dennis Hopper and Peter Fonda all give great performances, Hoppers character is one of my new favorite movie stoners.

312,jbaker4-1,The Hells Angels and others in the national news led to Easy Rider being a hit,6,2 February 2006,"Following World War II the United States saw an influx in two separate demographics: a growing population of juvenile delinquents and the organization of major motorcycle gangs. Free-wheeling, adventurous and marauding, these gangs tore up pavement of Southern California (for the most part). The Hells Angels Motorcycle Club was founded in San Bernardino, CA in 1948, but it was not until 1965 that the club erupted into the national spotlight following the allege rape of two young women in Monterey. And with the growing demographic of delinquent youths as movie go-ers, the studios started to cater to their lust for action and lawless-ness. An event in 1947 set the plot for the Marlon Brando film The Wild One (1953, László Benedek) but the movie eventually faded from the lime light. As the '60s got going, the Angels, and other gangs such as The Diablos and The Bandidos and The Gypsy Jokers, started to rev their engines and start to go out into public more often in formation. With their colors flying and their numbers in full swing, the gangs (or clubs) would sweep into a town for a weekend of debauchery and good ol' fashioned fun. The public started to take notice. Hunter S. Thompson, noted ""Gonzo"" journalist, went on the road for one year with the Hells Angels and released the book recounting their story, Hell's Angels: The strange and terrible saga of the outlaw motorcycle gangs in 1966. '66 also saw the release of The Wild Angels (Roger Corman). California Senators hurriedly put together investigations into these motorcycle clubs (MC) and the findings were published and quoted in newspapers, Newsweek, and even ever skeptical Time. It was clear that the motorcycle gangs were going to be the media sensation of the late 1960s.With the studios paying closer attention to the fragmenting demographics of movie go-ers, films started to cater to this lust for action. And Peter Fonda was right on top of things when it came to making MC films. He starred in The Wild Angels as ""Heavenly Blues"" and according to J Hoberman, Fonda cooked up the idea for Easy Rider while smoking dope in his hotel room at 3 am. It dawned on Fonda, allegedly, that the modern cowboy was the motorcycle outlaw. (There is another story explaining the origin of Easy Rider which actually includes a Hells Angel as told by Peter Coyote in his memoir.) (J. Hoberman. The Dream Life. p.191) With the idea revving and some accidental funding, Fonda and a very paranoid Dennis Hopper embarked on relaying the life of the motorcycle outlaw to the drooling public.Although the film was a low-budget exploitation of the lust for MC debauchery in the theatres, it succeeded in capturing some of the essence of the time period. The desire to find a lost freedom in the vast expanses of paved California and across the States was real. The communes and reliance on rice as a food source, hospitality as a way of surviving day to day, and the necessity of drugs were all well known to the youths watching the film premier in '69. Some people, now in their 50s, glance back and the film with a sentimental eye, but realize how cliché some of the devices and characters were. All in all the film was a huge success because it played off a national hype surrounding the outlaw MCs of the period and represented the very real struggle to find America despite America.",Easy Rider

I'm a big Jack Nicholson fan, and I'd heard such good praise for Easy Rider, a film that was generally described as being 'a sign of the times'. It's a sign of the times, and not much else. The beginning was by far the best part (excluding the credits, maybe), and the song 'Born To Be Wild' works. It works, works works. Now for the negative criticism.Poorly directed. Those flickering shots from scene to scene almost had me shaking my head, and I was thankful that it only happened a few times. Poorly acted. Jack Nicholson even was only passable as turning in a good performance, and it seemed like Peter Fonda and Dennis Hopper were just...talking. And, on top of all of that, it was horrendously written. Characters come and go like nobody's business, and when the main characters get killed off at the end (which was pointless, and you could kind of see it coming after that awful scene depicting their LSD induced state), you don't care. You feel no emotion.And just to make things worse, it was boring. The plot went along at a snails pace - I watched it a few weeks ago, and from what I remember, most of the film is just our guys on their bikes. Then at a hippie camp. Then on their bikes. Then in jail. Then on their bikes. Then sleeping. Then on their bikes. Then at a whorehouse. Then at a graveyard (wow, a slip in the pattern!). Then on their bikes. Then they just get shot by some rednecks in a van, and the plot ends. Joy! The film is a sign of the changing times, yes.

316,froggiebastard,A landmark cult classic- of SEISMIC proportions!,10,2 February 2004,"*Easy Rider* (1969) is one of those films in Hollywoods long history that STANDS OUT.  Not just for the quality of the film itself, its direction or its acting but for the sheer effect the film imprinted upon Hollywood and the culture at the time.  When released in 1969 the movie had, quite simply, a seismic impact on filmmakers and the industry as a whole. After a decade or so of barren years the film industry and its studio bosses were faced with declining audience numbers and was losing the battle with the great scourge of film, television. Columbia could not have predicted in a million years that a small, insignificent, low budget biker movie was about to change all that. Its success ultimately heralded a new age in cinema, whereby the old studio system gave away much of its power and resources to the new generation of young budding filmmakers.  It quite simply tapped into the mindset of the ""new"" audience, the sex, drugs and rock'n'roll generation. Watching the movie nowadays, some of its impact may have been eroded away by time and changing attitudes, but its enormous ""cult feelin'"" still remains. As a movie, it's very simple, small, personal and honest--essentially very European.  There is little storyline (Two guys do a drug deal and bike accross America) but in such a movie, it is not a loss. There is a whole aura attached to the movie, and a collasal feeling of freedom and hope but at the same time imprisonment.,inevitability and despair. A movie that can combine these conflicting emotions together is certainly a great one. Like *Bonnie & Clyde* it portrays the counterculture ""folk"" as the real victems. Peter Fonda and Dennis Hopper are the long haired hippies who, with the aide of a thumping rock n' roll soundtrack and drugs aplenty, ride their Harleys in search of the ""real"" America. Its subject matter is distinctly American but as previously mentioned it has a very European feel particularly the 'settlement' and the Mardi Gras scenes. However the movie doesn't glorify America and its ideals, as such. In fact, quite the opposite. Throughout the movie there is a certain darkness; a premonition of disaster hangs over the story. The ending is as shocking as ever before and the infamous line ""We Blew it"" lies as open to interpretation as ever before. Fonda and Hopper are assured and very wild as Billy and Captain America, Jack Nicholson makes a superb early career star appearence and whilst the directing is cheap it certainly isn't shoddy. It may be a bit disjointed and it may have lost some of its magic but the cult classic that is *Easy Rider* is still a momentous achievement and a film that altered the way Hollywood was run and arguably was a major catalyst for the New Golden Era of the 70's.  A true true cult classic- Essential Viewing.",Easy Rider
317,sweety2011,ridiculous plot with redeeming qualities,3,8 June 2011,"this film is about two hippies who are riders Wyatt and Billy (Peter Fonda and Dennis Hopper) that go to Mexico to buy cocaine, sells that to ""Connection"" (Phil Spector), then go on a journey on their bikes to, what they hope, New Orleans, in time for the Mardi Gras. along the way, they pick up a hitchhiker (Luke Askew), who lives in a commune with a whole bunch of other hippies. they stay there for a day or so, before hitting the road, but not before the hitchhiker gives them some LCD. as they get into the next town, they are arrested and thrown in jail, where they meet a lawyer named George (Jack Nicholson), also locked up, but who manages to get the three of them released. George rides with Wyatt, and whilst stopping to camp out, they get George, who is hard on his liquor, to try marijuana. the three of them stop at a small restaurant, where there are on-lookers, including local men and a police officer making mocking, racist, and homophobic remarks against them right from the get-go. from there, the police officer gathers his men to stop them from leaving town, so just as they think they are free, they catch up to them.I won't mention what happens then, but it certainly has one of those unexpected endings, and a rather silly one at that. one of those films with a message, with the observation that Americans talk a lot about the value of freedom, but are actually afraid of anyone who truly exhibits it. that is true, as has been the case with Americans, however, the problem that I had with it is that some of the scenes were too over-the-top, and disturbing, like in the scene with the two prostitutes, that really didn't need to be in the film.

318,antonio-anselmo,An Important Movie Today,10,9 January 2006,"This movie is about freedom. Period. It follows the journey of Captain America (Fonda) and his side kick Billy (Hopper). They begin their epic adventure by closing a major drug deal in California and journey to New Orleans with cash in hand. On their way they encounter all aspects of American life. The generous rancher, the tired idealists in the commune, the average man trying to find his purpose in life (performed by the young, and at the time, gifted Jack Nicholson), the rednecks (of various forms) and the prostitutes. Images of religion, philosophy, politics and love color just about every scene. Each ""musical"" scene has a message. Whether about altered states of mind, liberty, the ecosystem or just simply the pleasure of the wind blowing through your hair at 60 miles per hour. Put the movie in DVD player, crank the sound and relax. Imagine Hopper playing Billy as a precursor to the journalist in Apocalypse Now. Imagine Nicholson talking about aliens and his admiration of their freedom through technology. Imagine Fonda foreseeing his future in the bosom of the Virgin Mary. Just a great movie. Easily one the top 100 movies ever made. Even better, it was made by a member of one of Hollywoods great acting families without a Hollywood budget. Superb cinematography by Kovacs. Amazing score and excellent editing. Think of the gospels of Mark and Luke when you watch this movie. The symbolism, subconsciously intended or not, is riveting.

The movie seems like it's 4 hours long and nothing really ever happens.

As I recall, the movie was made for $250,000 which was unbelievable for shooting in film at that time. The file rolled out to national distribution, not because it was a ""Great Film"", a Hollywood blockbuster. It rolled out because it struck the chord of the division in this country caused by young kids challenging the established thinking. The movie didn't mention the war but everyone in the audience knew it was part and parcel of the whole problem at that time. It wasn't a Lawrence of Arabia kind of film with big actors and big sets, it just resonated with the drumbeat/heartbeat of what was happening.

327,rjbrad,This film was a rite of passage,9,17 August 2005,"I cannot overstate the importance of this movie in my personal development.In 1969 I was eighteen and a freshman at Cambridge University. I was also a near-fundamentalist and a member of the Christian Union. Its officials decreed that Easy Rider was unsuitable for Christian viewing; I'd seen some enthusiastic reviews which made me curious. Moral and spiritual dilemma followed. To view or not to view? I prayed about it - look, this is a long time ago, right - and decided that if it had been OK for the Christian Union's leaders to see it, if only to realise it was morally dubious, then it was OK for me. They hadn't been corrupted, presumably; the Lord would see that I wasn't either.So I went and it blew me away. I thought then and think now, that this is a magnificently perceptive commentary on hippie culture and one that only the medium of film can deliver. Naive idealism is weighed against the squalid reality of drugs (and indeed alcohol). Freedom is portrayed as often aimless, self-indulgent and downright boring. The underlying morality could be seen as puritanical: a celebration of the free-lovin' drop-out Sixties it ain't, more a weary end-of-decade critique thereof. I would have thought there was much to commend it to the Christian Union moralisers, yet as ever they couldn't see past the surface - drug abuse, loose women. Yet it has its high moments, in more ways than one, and is always a treat for the eyes.My decision to defy the Christian Union by seeing the film was an early step out of my fundamentalist prison and I haven't stopped walking yet. No-one's ever going to tell me what I can and can't watch again: nor will I censor anyone else's viewing. I'm still a believer, but not of the kind that the Christian Union would have thought will ever go to heaven. Guess I'll have to live with that.",Easy Rider

The hippies of the sixties started their conquest with the right ideas, then lost them somewhere along the way. Dennis Hopper, who directed, co-wrote and co starred along with Peter Fonda who produced, co-wrote and starred, managed to show the pros and cons of the hippie generation along with the quarrels of the different ideals that where happening in the United States at that time period.Author: Andy (film-critic) from Flatlands of Illinois ""This film should be shown in every American History class in the United States. It not only showed the beauty of the country of which we reside, but it also spoke about the people that reside in it."" http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0064276/usercomments This film links the far left liberal to the white collar conservative, the stoned to the sober, the poor to the rich, and the black to the white. It starts the viewer out with the idea of supporting the liberal views of 'free love' and 'stickin' it to the man' and then showing why these views don't work. It doesn't work because of human nature, the look out for #1 side anyway.As the ending stages of the film draw near, after the cross country journey and Mardis Gras, while sitting next to the campfire Wyatt proclaims to Billy, 'We blew it'. This is the pivotal line in the film that basically explains everything. They 'blew it' because they did exactly what they set out to prove was wrong. They went to find America, the America that is founded upon hard work and making your own way through life to the best of your ability through blood, sweat, and tears. But how did they make their money? The easy way, the way of the easy rider, by taking a free ride on the whore which is America. Buying a large quantity of cocaine, taking a little drive and selling it isn't exactly hard work.by chtfj21 (Sun Aug 20 2006 07:27:04 ) ""Can anyone explain the ending please? How on earth do those serial killers fit into the story? "" Some viewers may not comprehend the end of this masterpiece... Those viewers have missed the entire moral value of the story. The point of the story is not to glorify the hippies ideology but to prove that they have a completely misconstrued vision of freedom. The demise of Wyatt and Billy is the only way this film could have ended because it proved that people can turn violent if their ideals are tested too much.Do they call Fonda's character Wyatt just to pay some respect to Henry Fonda's role as Wyatt Earp, or does it go deeper? Really both characters stand for the same thing, just in a different way at a different time, freedom. Freedom is the main point of the statement that is Easy Rider but it is the perception of freedom that is really tested. Is freedom taking a free ride or earning what you receive, getting what you deserve and becoming only what you make for yourself, basically what Charlie Daniels sings about in ""Long Haired Country Boys"".The difference between Easy Rider and films pre-1960s is that cinema takes a turn from just being for purely entertainment to actually showing what's happening in our culture. Film makers turn away from the werewolves and feather-haired, green tight clad heroes to something a little more far out; what was happening right before our eyes.Quintessential, 23 June 2003 Author: richard winters (rwint) from Chicago, Illinois ""Lazlo Kovacs cinematography is outstanding. It captures the American landscape like its a travel show. The hippy commune scene is the best. You feel like you are right there. There is also the very memorable hallucinogenic drug scene in a graveyard. "" http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0064276/ A lot of the camera work was rather experimental and different from things audiences are used to seeing. They use things that would normally be looked upon as faults like sun flares and out of focus shots but there is also quite a bit of traditional camera work done too. There are John Ford influences such as landscape overpowering the main focal points and the traditional long shot to mid shot to short shot sequences.There is also an obvious Kurosawa influence in the directing such as capturing footage of the characters through natural elements such as a campfire, smoke, and foliage. The ever present visual metaphors also give a bit of a Kurosawa vibe. Some may take a viewer a few viewings of the movie to even notice.",Easy Rider

Nicholson's short performance not withstanding, the film has basically no plot, very little dialog, and blindly simplistic notions of issues.The commune scenes left me, admittedly, unclear whether Hopper was attempting to portray them in a positive or negative light. He achieved neither, making the commune's members appear absurdly foolish (c'mon, Hopper said it himself: ""It's SAND."") while almost maintaining a bliss that appeared almost cult-like. Was he saying ""Yeah, this doesn't work."", ""Communes are amazing places where everyone works together for the common good and share their love."", or ""Here's a commune, I don't get it either, but make up your own mind."" ?Yes, there were drug scenes, but frankly, they made no impact on me, a child born a year before the film was released.

The farmer lives a traditional work life off the land; the commune struggles to live off the land; we wonder how the ACLU lawyer got his money: was he born into it? Lawyer fees? Political contributions? He pays off the cops in the jail; how do you feel about that?; And, of course, the prostitutes have their way of making money.What is freedom? To be free from being judged? Free from having to work (i.e., having free time)? Free to do whatever you want? Free to live off the land and make your own way? Is it OK to obtain freedom from an illegal activity (e.g., smuggling drugs, paying off the cops)? Is all freedom good, or can you ""blow it""? Does having freedom come with any responsibility at all? Is unbridled freedom dangerous in a society that views freedom differently? Does conformity provide protection in some sense? ***SPOILER ALERT - SPOILER ALERT - SPOILER ALERT*** What is the meaning of the last scene?

340,melvn,Wyatt and Billy Ride Again...,8,11 July 2010,"Like many classic movies and books, Easy Rider has become victim to the historical elements of it's era. Today's young adult probably does not remember a time when smoking pot, hitting LSD, and open sex were more main stream and not as much counterculture. When truth be told, there was a time when a major part of our society smoked pot like people go to Starbucks today. Also, this movie was made during the reformation of the Black South. It is for these reasons that the movie seems to push the subject of drug use and the issues of bigotry to the level of hyperbole by today's standards. Interestly, the theme of drug usage by the main characters conveys a means of becoming more in tune with the moment, instead of trying to escape from any type of adverse reality. In other words, pot usage is not portrayed as any evil nor is it worshiped as a type of panacea(I am not soap boxing here-just observing).The heroes Wyatt and Billy seem to live by their own amoral code outside the law(and thus the irony of their names). They sell cocaine to fund their adventure to New Orleans. What is refreshing about the story is that neither the drug sale or subsequent usage inspire greed, violence, retribution, or war on some type of moral code and/or legal dogma. Their actions are a means of becoming something and getting somewhere with no intent of harm to anyone else. I don't know if there is any noble cause at steak, but one does get a real Robin Hood type of feel for the story and characters. It would be hard to imagine a movie done today with this theme without some type of condemnation in part or in whole of the drug scene.In a nutshell, I think that the magic of this movie is that Hopper was able to make a statement about American society at that time without using standard political jargon used today as his framework for the story. Easy Rider wasn't about war, but it was about ""peace man"". Easy Rider was made in a time when the story was written by those who relished living outside of the conventional political, authoritative and commercial system...Freedom maybe?",Easy Rider

I thought the actors were excellent. However, the ""shove it in your face"" symbolism was extremely off-putting. Like when they were about to embark on their trip, and one of the guys threw his watch on the ground. The camera lingered upon it, almost yanking on the collective shirttails of the audience, saying, ""See? Do you see it? The watch? You know -- time has no meaning anymore, man!

Produced by Peter Fonda and directed by Dennis Hopper, who play the lead roles, this movie is also a famous for catapulting Jack Nicholson into limelight. It's the classic indie movie, made on a rather modest budget and has since grown into a well deserved classic status.The movie is basically about two bikers whose journey through the American heartland is used to express a lot of things the makers wanted to say about the society.A couple of things Jack Nicholson's character says really strike you powerfully- the way the leadership of the world can be changed by aliens who are much better than us human beings who are waging wars over the measliest of matters and another about how the concept of absolute freedom can be terrifying. The way the so called cultures society shuns the three 'rough dudes'. Dude- Nicholson's character doesn't know the meaning of the word paving way for one of the lighter moments of the movie. When you come to think of the high brow society, you would realise that there could not have been any other climax for the movie. My favourite sequence is the collective drugged hallucinations. You could even imagine the two truckers going home to play with their young sons and daughters and saying grace before dinner satisfied of a very good deed done!Another great aspect of the movie is the soundtrack.

In the scene where they get the bikes Peter Fonda looks at his watch and throws it to the ground representing freedom of time. They then drive across the desert and the song Born to Be Wild kicks in. They go to a vacant motel and ask for a room when the man sees them he turns on the No Vacancy which leads to them sleeping outside around a campfire smoking pot and talking about interesting things, this first scene portrays in all of the other scenes how they lodge. These scenes to me are the best scenes in the movie because it shows that the narrow minded people at that time were scared of the ""new lifestyle"" of these people thus people thinking they are outlaws or bad people while in turn they are. Peter Fonda is the cool, mellow, laid back guy who is looking for what America really is, but in this he really isn't part of any group of people he is the outsider, the observer. Who never really is accepted but instead is trying to find himself. Dennis Hopper is the sidekick, the fool, who is a more paranoid fast paced man, who looks more at life as living it to the fullest. The two drive through the west and then meet a hitchhiker where they then spend the night at an Indian burial ground and smoke a lot of pot. To me this scene is the best campfire scene, of how the wind is blowing and they are talking, it seems so serious and meaningful and yet goofy and fun. The hitchhiker takes them to a commune where hippies are living together trying to grow food for themselves and live off the land. Billy (Dennis Hopper) is getting impatient of the commune and wants to hit the road to Mardi Gras. While Wyatt ( Peter Fonda) thinks life on the commune is good and that is how people should live, but goes along with Billy. Before they leave the hitchhiker gives Fonda acid and tells him to use this at the right place with the right people. Fonda takes it and off they go, they then get to a small town and drive in the parade. The sheriff arrests them saying they didn't have a permit for parading thus them ending up in the jail. They meet George Hanson (Jack Nicholson) in there cell a drunken lawyer who ends up in jail a lot of the time. They tell Goerge they are going to Mardi Gras and he is interested in going but says he cant. Fonda tells him he should and they give him a helmet and he goes with them. Nicholson is the lovable, drunken, American, opposite of Billy and Wyatt but is curious and accepts them unlike his counterparts. They travel on the road and then the scene changes and it is another campfire scene, this scene quite possibly being one of the most denying moments in the counterculture of the 60's showing about the old ways to the new. Nicholson drinks his whiskey Fonda tells him to ""do this instead"". Nicholson thinking it a hand rolled cigarette is actually a marijuana joint. Nicholson is hesitant but is reluctant and takes the joint. This scene is probably the most defining moment about drugs and such. They then hit Louisana where they go into a dinner, the locals have never seen anyone like them, and are making insulting jokes about them. They don't get there food and Nicholson decides to leave they leave and go on. At the campfire scene after that Nicholson talks about freedom where people who live it are feared and people that don't live but say they have it are dangerous this is an important scene since it shows people who are free and people who think they have freedom while really they are not free at all. At night while they are sleeping the hicks from the dinner come and kill Nicholson with a machete and hurting the other two. The hicks were smart not to kill Billy and Wyatt so they could frame it on them and make them look like criminals. They then go to New Orleans where Wyatt is uncertain about things and seems lost and unhappy about what America was. They hit Mardi Gras and go to a whorehouse where they and two women go into the streets and then go to a cemetery resulting in the acid scene. Then cutting off with both of them hitting the road and probably going to Florida. At the last campfire scene Wyatt his sad and says to Billy they blew it the last words in the film. They then drive the next day and see two hicks where one of them jokingly puts a gun to Billy, Billy flicks him off and he gets mad and shoots Billy. Wyatt goes back to him and is going to get help, yet the truck turns around and he is shot and dies. The ending shot goes from them on the ground to the air. The music in this film was great, and the life of the hippies, and shows Americans darker side to a real context. When I first saw this film it changed my ways of thinking and living. i think this film was one of the most important films in America.",Easy Rider
344,thewhorule,Peter Fonda is simply amazing,10,18 March 2003,"I truly enjoyed this movie.  With the great acting and plot it was one of the best movies I've seen.  Hopper and Fonda both captured what life is truly like.  They dealed with drug use, Prejudice, and much more. Although the movie was great there were some things here and there that I wasn't totally pleased with.  I think the film compisition was good at some places and junk at other places.

Being quite open-minded about films because of needing to adapt my usual watching for my film studies class, I stuck with it to the bitter, unsatisfying end. The only words I can use to describe this ""classic"" film are words that I don't think I'm allowed to say. The plot line was dull and full of pointless, unexplained non-sequiturs. The directing was painfully bad and the flash-sequence editing hurt my eyes. I spent the better half of the film waiting for the appearance of Jack Nicholson, one of my very favourite actors. But I'm afraid that even his cheeky-smiled performance couldn't salvage the flotsam of this film from the giant whirlpool of sewage. I did actually enjoy the LSD trip scene; the direction really picked up here, and I started to change my mind about it THEN what did they do they killed off both protagonists in the last minute, leaving some very frayed and untied knots of the story. It left me thinking ""Was that it?!?!"" and grieving the hour and a half of my life I will never get back that I spent watching this piece of crap. If I could give it zero stars I would.",Easy Rider

347,bernynhel,This film not in the top 250??? I'm that old?,9,31 May 2006,"I vote on a film not by comparing it to every other film I can think of but how I remember feeling coming out of the theater wen I first saw it. Those of you old enough to have seen Easy Rider in 1969 and young enough to have been under 30 at the time, think about it. Now, when you think about how you felt coming out of that theater combined with the fact that Easy rider is not in the Top 250 and Star Wars and Lord of the Rings are in the top 10, doesn't that make you feel old? Now the Exorcist, which debuted 4 years later, is another film I distinctly remember, as I do with Easy Rider and a short list of others, not only how I felt coming out of the theater, but who I was with, what we were wearing, and the comments about it to each other. Those memories begin from the moment we step out of the theater (the memory of the period from when the film ended to that point is clouded in the numbness of the time) and run for about a fifty yard stroll. The Exorcist is down at #182 as of this writing. The Matrix, #34. I do find some consolation however, that Vertigo, Taxi Driver, Paths of Glory and To Kill a Mockingbird are at #s 35, 36, 39 and 40, respectively. Funny, huh?",Easy Rider
348,willjaco,"Epicurean, Hippie Slop",5,4 July 2019,"An hour and thirty-five minutes through the mind of Dennis Hopper, a mind I was quite dubious to delve into given the stories that come from the making of Apocalypse Now. I forced my eyes to traverse through every frame of this venerated, ""classic"" in hopes that I could locate an edifying aspect. Upon reflection, I did in fact. It was the only ethical character within the entire picture... Nature. The ineffable beauty and great indifference of the various landscapes the two primary characters cycle through. Here are two drug-worshiping hedonists chasing transient and corporeal pleasures with their purported lifestyle of absolute ""freedom"", oblivious to the Good that encompasses them! Perhaps this is why the film feels dry, vapid, and devoid of any real life: it is brimmed with New Age concepts and propaganda that promote a free-loving Utopia where every desire is satisfied without exertion or discipline. To quote Edward Abbey, ""a world of insufferable boredom, downgrading humans to the sloth and torpor of swine in a luxury sty; unworthy of us, the death of our nature."" This is why the film has no real destination, nor the journey the two cyclists embark upon. Shortly after the nonsensical and unbearable LSD montage, the Captain America character confesses to the other, ""You know Billy, we blew it."" Much like the gasoline tanks in their motorcycles, they can try filling themselves up with money, sex, drugs, and their empiricism, but it will only last a short while. Alas, at the end of the film the souls of these characters, akin to the desert ground they departed from, are left parched and spiritually unfulfilled.",Easy Rider

Granted it may seem to have no ending to some people, but I found that to be part of why it was so fascinating. The scenery and shots in this film alone are worth taking the time to watch it. No film has ever made me want to go on a road trip as much as Easy Rider.The acting by Jack Nicholson is what is expected of him (I mean, he plays his character extraordinarily well, but it could be viewed as a typecast).I found that the character Fonda plays to be very idealistic, and also very enduring.

The movie starts with two young devils without a cause, searching for adventure ""and whatever comes there way"". What at first seems like a frivolous and aimless search for adventure, evolves into a quest for survival, and deeper meaning among a conservative, racist culture that is not only hostile towards the two ""long hairs"", it actually seeks to exterminate them. As is explained by a ACLU lawyer they pick up along the way this is due to the fear they instill in that culture, and the freedom they represent. The two bikers end up as martyrs in the end, killed by some hicks. What a messed up ending, but it wouldn't have been as poignant any other way. (If they had just ended up riding into the sunset for instance, i wouldn't be writing this review. I would sleep well, and forget about this movie, without really thinking about things.)

Peter Fonda made a total fool of himself and he probably did a lot to sink his entire career as an actor. even allowing for the fact that it is a timepiece and has to be taken in context, this film is still embarrassingly bad. Dennis Hopper was believable but nothing could save this movie from what Fonda did to it. it's sad to say, but the best part was probably the ending. in the case of any type of work or ""creation"" it is pretty easy to tell how much effort went into it - and they apparently slapped this one together pretty fast. what i can't figure out is how something so laughable became so famous.",Easy Rider
353,the-freed-mind,tfm,10,15 November 2004,"Yes this movie is a hallucinogenic masterpiece but more importantly is that the protagonists of the movie certainly did not need LSD to transport them to that higher level of order. Life is about more than drugs as the main characters surely would be able to tell you. Drugs are simply tools that one *may* invoke in order to achieve a higher feeling of being. When one would become a slave to them is when one would truly f*ck up. This movie is quite simply the greatest film ever on the treatise on what is human nature.Fans of Nietzsche, Kierkegaard, and other such luminaries of an existentialist genre should certainly pull this picture from the bowels of American culture and rescue it within their own scopes and concepts of reality. Landmark performances that are dealt with such brevity and emotional mastery that they have influenced countless lives. Peter Fonda and Dennis Hopper are not only visionary geniuses, they are the ubermensch that Nietzsche speaks about and offers up as a symbol of freedom. This movie is about liberty - personal freedom - and those who are locked into a box of contemporary life should continually ignore that which is better than them. Those that rated this movie low simply are not living their lives to their fullest potential - simple and understandable, given the herd mentality of most folks.",Easy Rider

The film has zero redeeming value what-so-ever. And now, in order to get this review posted, I see that I have to say more about it. Okay: don't waste your time, nostalgia or not, this is a pitiful and embarrassing film that pretends to explain aspects of the 60's - which period was a very dynamic time in history with all sorts of lessons learned and icons recognized.

""Easy Rider"" struck a cord. Crossing America, free of restraints and enjoying life. Every time I watch it, I remember when, and dream the old dreams. Here were three young actors, Fonda, Hooper and Nicholson defining the restless spirit of a generation, decrying the materialism of our parents, and making their mark on their own. Now all of us are a few decades older, have grown children and bills, responsibilities. Yet deep inside us we can go back to those days of freedom, no responsibilities and let our spirit soar.

And to make it even better, Jack Nicholson's George Hanson character is magnificent, all of the characters have their own charm. This really is the perfect and defining road movie, and what can i say about the landscape, it is marvelous, charming and somehow relaxing.As I said before the music is great, it really fits with every scene it is on, it completes the film.I really recommend this movie to everybody, no exceptions, it really is one of my favorite films of all time, it never gets old,one can really identify with the characters, you feel free like them, you really do feel like a rebel, a feeling few films can manage to create in its viewer, 60's hippie movement in all its glory.",Easy Rider

359,madastrid,What is everyone on about?,2,16 November 2016,"I try so, so hard to enjoy ""classic"" movies, I really do. But I just can't get why everyone's so fussed about this mess. Low-budget, quirky films can be done really well. So why wasn't this? Half of it feels like an extended music video, while the other half is an incomprehensible series of so-called ""events"" that lead to nothing. Every time I felt like something might happen in the plot, it just... didn't. When people say that this is classic, I think they're just referring to the feeling it gets across. Sure, it vaguely sends out a message about corporate America and how skewed their idea of freedom is, and it definitely drives the whole drug culture point home, but what else? There isn't really a plot in sight, and since it's completely lacking in artistic merit, it isn't effective overall. Weird editing and rock music doesn't equal a good movie, and I can't wrap my head around the appeal. The only person that's really doing any half decent acting in 'Easy Rider' is young Jack Nicholson, playing pretty much every character he played in these days. But of course - as lazy writing leads to lazy plot - he's killed off without an afterthought. You've got no emotional connection to these characters whatsoever, so all I felt when he died was disappointment, as I thought that maybe his introduction to the film was finally the end of the tiring exposition. After the novelty of the rebellious music and explicit scenes wears off, what are you left with? You're left with this: a badly edited, poorly acted, lazily written ""classic"" just waiting for nostalgic people to come along and tell everyone how great it is. Almost every single character in the movie is annoying and two-dimensional, never developed further than the occasional weed-hazed angsty comment or the edgy, innovative edits that signify... something, maybe. Don't even get me started on the ending. Without the development of tension - not a single bit - Billy and Wyatt's deaths are really just a relief. Finally, it's over! After an hour and a half of cheesy montages and misplaced avant garde scenes, poorly disguised excuses to use some European-style artsy camera-work, I couldn't care less that they're killed. The first time I saw this and the final credits rolled up on screen, I couldn't help but laugh: was that seriously the end!? Clearly the lack of direction just got too much for them to handle, so they washed it all away with a half-baked attempt at a meaningful ending. The stagnant acting from Fonda and frankly irritating performance from Hopper add precisely nothing to their murder, and the fact that people actually thought this was anything but rubbish when it came out baffles me. Basically, I think this film's success is due only to the state of America and New Hollywood cinema at the time. Once the Hayes rule was abandoned, censorship thrown to the wind, everything was exciting - drugs, sex, alternative lifestyles, motorbikes... And that's all this film is, a montage of youth appeal and trying too hard, while simultaneously coming across like no effort was put into its production at all. Oh well. At least it's got some Hendrix in there.",Easy Rider

362,masterron1,What does it mean to be free?,8,5 December 2020,"I love exploring the 1960s. In fact, I'd go so far as to say it's my favorite decade in movies. It meets that sweet spot in-between the Golden Age of Hollywood, where it was just getting into the swing of things (we got movies that would later be perceived as classics), and the New Age where we started seeing a lot more risks being taken both in terms of style and storytelling.One of the films credited with ushering in the new age is the 1969 movie...Easy Rider.The film follows two hippie bikers played by Peter Fonda and Dennis Hopper (who've just made it big by smuggling cocaine) traveling from LA to New Orleans for Mardi Gras.On the way, they interact with hippie communes, conservative small towns, whorehouses, and Jack Nicholson.During one of the many ""camping out"" scenes we get a great monologue from George (Nicholson's character) about the meaning of actually being free.This expression fully encompasses some of the ideas behind the 60s counterculture and what our leads illustrate in their travels:
-We get amazing views of the country as Wyatt and Billy traverse the American South
-We get a surprisingly liberal use of drugs (including a verrrry long acid trip)
-And a very free expression of sexBy that same token, the more conservative elements of the South react negatively and, even, violently to our characters, especially in the scene where our leads enter a diner to gawking onlookers.Now, typically when I look at films like these (ones that are more thematically driven than dependent on a specific narrative) I look at how effective the film is at conveying the feeling that it's trying to convey.So, how does this stack up? Let's start with the characters:Billy, despite seeming like the more laid-back of the bikers, is generally more pragmatic: He comes across as more playful, especially when it comes to women, but he constantly tries to keep Wyatt on-task by pushing him to leave the commune. He, also, becomes defensive when it comes to the comfort of his friend and safety of his fortune.Wyatt, by contrast, is the more introspective of the two: Some of the earliest lines of dialogue from him show his appreciation of the farmer's simple life, which ties-in thematically with the concept of freedom and, possibly, with Wyatt's conclusion of the journey.None of this is particularly deep, but, it should be noted, that the dialogue is very realistic, which makes sense considering much of it was improvised (often while the actors were high). Many movies have character developing dialogue that's very, well, ""movie"". It comes across as unnatural despite developing the story. So, it's really neat to see a contrasting example that has similar characters with subtly distinctive characteristics. They develop in a realistic way and, I think, that's very much due to Dennis Hopper's filmmaking.Between the spastic scene transitions coming off of scenes where the characters have been smoking weed and the snap zooms, exposed film, and strange voiceovers of the LSD scene, Hopper's methods really put you there.My personal favorite shot has a farmer shoeing a horse in the foreground with Wyatt repairing his motorcycle tire in the background. It immediately draws a parallel between 2 individuals who seek the aforementioned personal freedom. Wyatt expresses his admiration for the life the farmer lives, but, alas, that's not the life he lives and, ultimately, as he reflects about his journey in the final monologue, he realizes his (and Billy's) choices weren't the best ones.Easy Rider becomes a great expression of 60s counterculture with its unique editing style, realistic dialogue, and subtly conveyed themes. Definitely worth a look for any film fan.",Easy Rider
