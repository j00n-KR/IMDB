0,Leofwine_draca,Too long for its own good,4,11 January 2020,"BURNING is another Korean thriller with arthouse sensibilities that falls down due to the basic premise. What we have here is a mystery focused around the psychology of the main characters but with only 5 or 6 main plot points. The yes is all about mood-building with lots of landscape shots and slow, drawn-out dialogue scenes. After the first hour I was getting restless, and by the end I realised how tedious I was finding all this. For those about to suggest I have a short attention span, I'm a fan of arthouse cinema made by auteurs injecting meaning into their work; Herzog and Ki-duk in particular. This just feels like padding and is twice the length it needs to be. It looks wonderful and the performances are excellent, but in the end it really doesn't have much to say.",Burning
1,Horst_In_Translation,This film will rock your life,8,12 June 2019,"""Beoning"", probably more known as ""Burning"", is a South Korean movie from 2018. The version I watched at the theater, which is the most common I think, ran for approximately 2.5 hours, slightly under, but apparently there is also a television version that runs for 1.5 hours? That does surprise me a bit honestly because it means that the film got cut down to 60% of its original size. I mean, of course we always hear that there are basic versions (like for Malick) that are really long and get cut down to a pretty low percentage, but as for this one here I struggle to see how the short version can be a success because it works so well as a character study honestly and I would not want to miss anything from it. On the contrary: It did not drag one bit and for all I care it could have gone on for another half hour or maybe even hour. That is how good it was. But back to the basics first of all. The director and one of the writers is Chang-dong Lee, a really experienced Asian filmmaker, who has been active in the industry for a long time. Still it is kinda surprising that despite this long activity, he really is not the most prolific filmmaker with the number of movies he made still being in single-digit territory. But if this still results in high-quality movies like the one we got here, I won't mind a bit other than it being quite a shame I cannot watch more from him. As for the cast, simple is the key here. There are really only 3 people at the center of this movie and everybody beyond that has virtually no screen time at all. And that is maybe the reason why the film works so well. The focus on these three was just really good. Ah-in Yoo is the lead actor and has benn pretty successful in Asia for a while. For Jong-seo Jun, it was the first performance of her career actually and boy what a start to get going, even if admittedly the way her character was written really helped. (I certainly would list her second.) And then there is Steven Yeun, perhaps the main reason why this film was also a huge success outside Asia. People all around the globe know him of course for his role in The Walking Dead and I have seen 3 or 4 seasons of that I believe and honestly I did not make the connection it is him. The reason may be that on his trademark show he plays a rather beta male character next to all these alpha males, who is not even the dominant and path-shaping person in his romance relationship and in this film here he plays a really wealthy man who does great with women and knows exactly how to behave to get what he wants. And one thing the actor behind said character certainly wanted, but really did not expect to happen, was the gigantic awards recognition he received, some of it by really prestigious bodies. I mean he was dominating the critics circuit last season for the most part, even if, just like his lead actor counterpart Ethan Hawke, he did not get the Oscar nomination. But who would have thought that it would be the one from Walking Dead to makes waves second to none.Now as for the movie itself, the premise is as simple as the number of key actors. We have a young man, who meets a girl, a former fellow student and falls for her. She is off to a trip to Africa soon though and when she returns, she brings another (also Korean) man she met there before eventually disappearing without a trace, so it is not clear what happened or at least not 100% certain. I must say this movie, the longer it went, even felt like a modern film noir to me. It is Lee's marvellous attention to detail here that defines the film really from beginning to end. The sun shining into the room for that brief moment could have felt very pretentious if not handled right, but the way they used it for that sex scene was so tastefully done that I was in awe. The two have never been closer to each other. Another would be how for a really brief moment the potential killer cannot hide how much he is bored by the attractive girls he is with. Or the cat they catch outside in the parking lot. Or the greenhouse metaphor that most likely stands for the girls he kills. He clearly enjoys the power and bragging about his deeds without admitting anything. Or the ending that is as shocking as unexpected really and makes a nice reference to the title as well as the aforementioned greenhouse reference. A good title. But even if everything looks so obvious, we should not rule out other possibilities such as the Asian Gatsby (another excellent reference) being just a show-off who is indeed innocent. Perhaps the cat just listens to voices or needed these seconds to be ready to move towards him and get caught. We never know. Nonetheless explaining the contents of this drawer is a bit difficult. So overall, yeah well I think the message is clear, even if the writers enjoyed playing with our minds. Lets look at the inclusion early on that the female protagonist was treated pretty badly by the male protagonist in her earlier years, the talk about her having something done etc. There could be a reason for revenge. And then also the words on how there never was a cat, there never was the well, but even all of this is somewhat corrected for example when the main character's mother says there was a fountain or when the cat reappears. Speaking of the main character's mother, this was also an area where they did really well. They did not try to include any story line about his broken childhood just for the sake of it. The mother was there only to let us know the well existed. Nothing more, nothing less. The father courtroom part is also just mere neutral observation. The main character observes. We observe him. But it was never handled in a way where the director wanted us to care for the father or hope for an acquittal even.I said a lot about Yeun already, but one more scene in which he really rocked my world was his reaction when the main character told him he is in love with the girl. By the way, his last words are also really interesting when he is confused that the protagonist did not bring the girl. Was he playing more psychological games or is he really clueless to where she ended up eventually? But now I also want to want to say a few words about Jong-seo Jun. She was so good, so mesmerizing and stunning that it was almost impossible for me not to fall in love with her. Also she felt on the one hand as such an inspiring character, but on the other also as a bit tragic and with that I am talking mostly about these two scenes when she starts crying out of nowhere and talks about how she prefers not ever having existed basically over a failed existence. We also find out indirectly there is no contact between her and her parents anymore and she has no friends. Maybe that explains her longing partially also to see other parts of the world and get away from it all for a while. And even if she ends up with the rich guy then, which initially did not seem 100% obvious to me, there are words as we also find out from hearsay about who was her true number one and that it caused some kind of jealousy to Yeun's character and that he finally lost his coolness, indifference and absolute control over everything and everybody (including himself) for a moment, which could have been the situation in which he killed her. Okay I made the cross at spoilers, so you should not be surprised. I also want to say I am not only happy about Yeun's awards recognition, but also about the film's in general. It really is deserving that it was successful at Cannes and that it also managed to get on the shortlist of potential Oscar nominees. Shame it did not make the final cut though. It would have been a deserving nominee for sure. I liked Shoplifters for example too and I am kinda glad it got nominated, but this one here is even better. So yeah, I would have liked Burning to get in over the German entry perhaps and I am saying this as a huuuuge Lives of Others fan. This one we have here is an excellent movie, a definite contender for top5 of 2018 and you should very much check it out. If anybody thinks that the glory days of Asian cinema were over with the demise of Kurosawa and the best and most known Korean films also lying a bit in the past now, then you will perhaps change your mind after seeing this one. Or at least understand that, if a few more good films from Korea are being released in the coming months, this country is still producing quality (high one) on a really regular basis. Burning is a triumph. Do not miss out under any circumstance.",Burning
2,kosmasp,(Slow) Burning,10,17 May 2019,"Korean cinema produces highlights that quite a lot of people are not aware of. Landing Steven Yeun (who's internationally known) in one of the lead roles might help change that. But just because there is ""Hollywood"" star in this, does not make this a Hollywood movie or a movie that is easy to digest. And I'm not trying to make a judgement here.If you want to, you can call it a ""warning"". A warning because the pacing here is quite slow. And it is rather character driven with a difficult to define goal or theme. The latter is only really true in the beginning and of course the director has a clear idea of where he wants to go or where the characters have to be. Very low key, but still high on drama and mystery. The movie dares you to make your own conclusions but also gives you hints, not facts. And we are left wondering a couple of things. Very weird indeed, but also very good",Burning
3,evanston_dad,Too Languorous for Its Own Good,7,19 March 2019,"""Burning,"" to stick with the heat metaphor, builds itself to a low simmer and gradually turns up the heat until the whole thing boils over in the film's last moments. But I'd be lying if I said the movie didn't risk losing me along the way.If you can't handle enigmas, stay away from this film, because that's all it is. It's fascinating to a point, and I enjoyed its refusal to easily hand over its secrets to its audience. In fact, many of the questions the film poses don't get answered at all, or at least you have to make up your own answer if you want the satisfaction of closure. It's stylish too, I'll give it that. But it's also very slow and languorous, almost too much so, and it ultimately feels like the pay off isn't quite worth the time invested.Grade: B+",Burning
4,phd_travel,Not that great,4,3 January 2021,"After watching Parasite I decided to check out this highly acclaimed movie from the year before that. It's no way as good. It's alright but not great by an means. Many have praised the atmosphere and seen lots of social commentary etc about this movie. I found the plot straightforward and didn't see that much in terms of metaphor or symbolism. The characters are not very sympathetic and didn't invoke like or dislike of them either way/ Unlike most Korean movies the drug taking and promiscuity seems jarring. The mystery lasts a while not much of a twist or anything. The ending is definite but didn't like it. Lots of commentary about slowness of the pace. There are some unnecessary scenes. Drama thriller it feels half baked. Yoo Ah In is a convincing actor.
Not worth watching",Burning
5,deloudelouvain,For once a Korean movie I didn't like.,3,21 February 2019,"There is no doubt Korean movies are the best when it's about Asian movies. There are some really good movies coming from South-Korea but unfortunately this one is not one of them, or at least not to me. I won't say the acting was bad because that's actually the positive thing about Beoning. The actors did a good believable job, but the story is just too slow, unfinished and unexplained. I don't like guessing what happened, I like clear answers when the movie is over and here you just don't get that. Too slow, unfinished, too long, all things that didn't satisfy me at all.",Burning
6,christopher-underwood,And the magic begins.,9,25 January 2020,"There are several potentially off putting elements to this unique film from South Korea. It is rather long, the narrative structure is a little flaky, the leading man lacks charisma and things happen that we struggle to comprehend. On the other hand this is, without doubt, a beguiling, enchanting and entertaining tale that is intriguing from the start. Certainly, it would be fair to call this opaque but all the more to draw one in. At the very start we asked to wonder about the seeming absence of a cat. Is it real? Does it matter? And then we are distracted by the information provided by the young girl whose cat it is, that as the room faces North it gets no sun. Except that is at a certain time of the day when a shaft of light is reflected off the Seoul Tower. And then we see it. And the magic begins.",Burning
7,lasttimeisaw,Lee Chang-dong's pyromaniac allegory mines into the miasma of today's South Korean society with an astonishing amount of wits and boldness,9,7 February 2019,"After an 8-year hiatus, South Korean auteur Lee Chang-dong returns with a bang! BURNING, his sixth feature, is a slow-burn mystery drama set in the city of Paju, Jong-su (Yoo), a novelist wannabe who takes odd jobs to make ends meet, one day, he bumps into Hae-mi (Jun), his childhood neighbor and classmate, who lives alone in a bedsit and leaves Jong-su to feed her cat when she takes a planned trip to Africa alone.BURNING commences as a standard meet-cute, a slightly awkward boy and a pretty, proactive girl who daringly makes the first move. But Lee carves out a patiently detailed narrative to hint us that something is afoot with Hae-mi, for one thing, she idiosyncratically contemplates on vanishing, her pantomime-prone antics and theory of make-believing tally with the fact that Jong-su, in fact has never seen her cat ""Boil"" in person during all his cat-feeding duties (in spite of its dungs and the need to replenish the cat food).Jong-su's budding love toward Hae-mi comes in for a cold shower when the latter returns from her spiritual trip with a newfound friend Ben (Yeun), a handsome smoothie from beau monde, who claims his job is ""play"", whose presence instantly pales Jong-su into a self-conscious gooseberry. Hesitantly hobnobbing with Ben and his friends in their posh haunts and Ben's plush apartment, Jong-su finds Hae-mi's ambiguous attitude baffling and Ben's mysterious charisma a bit daunting and suspicious. After a golden afternoon spending in Jong-su's derelict farm (which is put into his reluctant care after his father serves a sentence in jail), where the trio seems to enjoy a reticent communion, with Hae-mi obliviously dancing in the buff under the westering sun, and Ben confessing to Jong-su his bi-monthly greenhouse-burning diversion, an activity might stand for something far more sinister when Hae-mi vanishes from thin air after an seemingly interrupted phone call.Intending to get the bottom of Hae-mi's disappearance, Jong-su traces all the threads back to Ben, after finding out two ""obvious"" clues, one is Ben's new cat who incredibly responds to the name ""Boil"", another is an electronic watch similar to the one he gifts Hae-mi, is later found in Ben's bathroom drawer, Jong-su, who has been delineated as a reactive, taciturn youngster and is characterized by his habitual thousand-yard stare, ably takes a vigilante mission to seek vengeance and surprisingly, Ben's instinct reaction leaves a more ambivalent feeling of what actually happens to Hae-mi, and what is exactly Ben's misdeed?Loosely based on Haruki Murakami's short story BARN BURNING, BURNING's 2-hour-and-a-half running time manifests Lee's indubitable ambition to project a larger picture with its relatively simple narrative structure, and the most extraordinary thing is his ingenuity and boldness of interspersing missing pieces along the road for audience to piece them together and formulate one's own comprehension of the mystery, which makes for an immensely content and thought-provoking experience for those who can not be sated by a straightforward answer. Is Hae-mi a chronic fabulist, is there really a well near her old home, is she an ""offering"" of Ben's morbid ritual? Or a bit far-fetch, but the homoerotic tension between Ben and Jong-su is quite tangible, noting Lee's deliberately and cautiously deployed no-physical-contact communication between them, until the moment when Ben poke Jong-su's heart for that ""humming"" sensation he relishes and pursues, which prompts this reviewer to second-guess that his self-confessed jealousy might stem from an entirely different source, that might grant the love triangle with a new perspective (yes, he is seen reading Faukner, Jong-su's favorite author).So, what is the bigger picture here? First and foremost, the gaping stratification between the 1% and the the 99% is too big to overlook, Jong-su and Ben's paralleled lives have no intersection if not for Hae-mi's existence, once their paths are crossed, the former has only his dignity to lose and the latter goes nimble-handedly to dissimulate any faint impression of patronage to create a semblance of harmony. Then, there is Hae-mi, another constituent of 99%, but burdened with a disadvantage of her sex, a girl who dwells on ""small hunger""and ""big hunger"", hopelessly tries to compensate her material poverty with a lofty spiritual richness, her own misery emerges as a poignant criticism of a misogynous society (Jong-su's biting remark about her nude dance is a thrilling dagger into her heart) that only takes girls on the skin-deep value (Jong-su once remarked that she is ugly, according to Hae-mi, who owns up that her prettiness is totally artificial during their first encounter), which, if anything, is a tacit accomplice of pushing girls like her to the hands of the ilks like Ben, to have their personhood be obliterated without a trace. Incidentally, social commentary and gender politics aside, Lee also punctuates the story with geopolitical sideswipes that cover North Korea, China and USA altogether.The trio performers, each richly builds a unique persona with either throbbing vulnerability tinted with a soupçon of self-hurting resignation of a benighted future (Jun, in her first movie), enigmatic urbanity smacks of danger and caprices (Yeun), or strange tenacity riddled with tiny bleeding wounds caused by toxic masculinity (Yoo), together they actualize Lee's perceptive vision of a masterpiece that pluckily delves into the mystical miasma shrouding our contemporary society, in tandem with Mowg's howlingly otherworldly soundtrack and the divine landscape (misty, royal-blue early morning, gold-hued gloaming, etc.) captured by DP.

8,MOscarbradley,A highlight of the new Korean cinema,10,16 December 2019,"At the centre of Chang-dong Lee's superb movie ""Burning"" is a triangle of sorts. Jong-su, (Ah-in Yoo), is an unemployed young Korean who wants to be a writer. One day he meets Hoe-mi, (Jong-seo Jun), a girl he knew from school. They have sex and then she goes off to Africa, asking Jong-su to look after her cat until she returns. When she does, she's with Ben, (Steven Yeun), a seemingly rich playboy who just might be a little more dangerous than he looks.Lee's film is based on Haruki Murakami's short story ""Barn Burning"" and since Jong-su's favourite author is Faulkner there just might be a clue in the film's title as to Ben's character. It's a long, beautifully detailed slow-burn of a picture, superbly directed and played. Ah-in Yoo displays just the right degree of gaucheness as the film's hapless young hero and Yeun is both sauvely sexy and suitably menacing as the mysterious Ben. As much an enigmatic character study, (Ben isn't the only mysterious character on view), as it is a thriller this casts its own very disquieting spell and is certainly a highlight of the new Korean cinema.",Burning
9,Pjtaylor-96-138044,Slow burn.,8,2 February 2019,"'Burning (2018)' is an odd film. It's extremely difficult to get a hold on, much less categorise. Primarily, it seems to be a methodical, realistic and low-key drama, but it's also a character-based, somewhat obsessive romance and an enigmatic, occasionally unsettling mystery-thriller in, essentially, equal measure. These differing genres aren't interweaved, necessarily; rather, they simply co-exist in one strange concoction. It's difficult to describe but certainly has an effect, even if it takes a while to do so. It's a slow burn, that's for sure. The main dynamic doesn't come into play for quite some time and, even then, it isn't explored as tightly as you'd like until the movie's latter half (or final third, maybe). Still, the piece grows on you, even after its credits have rolled. Its main 'attraction', I suppose, is the fact that it's so uncompromisingly ambiguous. There are, essentially, two interpretations of the story's events. One of these is perhaps more interesting - and, indeed, obvious (as it's what the protagonist believes) - as you're watching and the other is perhaps more interesting - and starts to feel more plausible - after the experience is over. In a masterful and callous move, the feature doesn't confirm or deny either interpretation. There is no proof of anything, just a series of implications. This makes the ending all the more harrowing, no matter what you think 'really' happened. The final scene makes you question your interpretation of what's come before and expertly puts doubt into your mind. It helps that our 'hero' is a bit of an enigma himself, equally relatable as creepy (I guess depending on how you see the overall situation). Incidentally, I think both versions of the narrative are valid - simultaneously, even. It feels like the intention was to have two equally 'true' readings that you'll go back and forth between, since there's no way to ever really know. The subtle hints that make this work are brilliant. This piece certainly doesn't hold your hand; it lets you come to your own realisations and has pretty much no 'on-the-nose' exposition to guide you. Sometimes, the experience isn't all that engaging, though. It's not exactly boring, but it isn't gripping, either. Once you start to realise what it's doing, however, it becomes infinitely more interesting. The stuff that almost seems initially 'boring' also kind of seems necessary in retrospect, in order to create the laid-back but uneasy atmosphere that's vital in putting you on edge. It's expertly crafted and gets better the more you think about it. In fact, it's arguably better to think about than it is to watch (in a good way). It's actually a refreshingly restrained, boldly unique and confidently calm piece unlike almost any other. A swing-and-a-miss is better than safe, in-the-box filmmaking. Luckily, this is a swing-and-a-hit, even if it takes a while for the hit to register. 8/10",Burning
10,dromasca,life as a thriller,9,19 January 2019,"The cinematographic style of Chang-dong Lee reminds me the works of the Japanese master Yasujirô Ozu. Their films have the same pace that reflects a mode of life in which time flows differently than in our 'Western' civilization. The setting is described with infinite care to details while the overall composition and architecture tells a lot about the places and the country where the action takes places. The historical and social landscape is present and influences what happens on screen, but is not the determinant factor, the stories are universal. The characters are described with compassion and as spectators we are encouraged to understand their deep motivations of living the way they live and doing what they do. And yet, there is always a measure of mystery that surrounds their actions, we never understand all the details, and we are not served with rational explanations about everything. Much of the story in 'Burning', his latest movie, takes place at night or in fog - that's a measure of things that cannot be fully explained. Like in true life.There are several layers of mystery in this film, although the story may appear at first be rather simple. It may be the story of a romantic triangle involving three youngsters in contemporary Korea. Jong-su (Ah-in Yoo ) and Hae-mi (Jong-seo Jun) are two childhood friends from a village some place close to the border with North Korea. They meet in a street fair, they reconnect after barely recognizing each other, they make love, and then she leaves for a trip to Africa leaving him take care of a cat we never see in her apartment. When she returns, she seems to have a new boyfriend, Ben (Steven Yeun), a man a few years older, rich, driving a Porsche and entertaining a few caprices, some odd, some of these that only rich people can afford. I will not tell more to avoid the sin of revealing too much. The story takes the path of a thriller, but the real life, the characters and the relations between them will intrigue and disquiet the spectators much earlier. Real life or imagination, as nothing is straight clear in this wonderful film.The two and a half hours of viewing passed for me without once looking at my watch. I was absorbed by the simple story, by the complexity of the relations that build between the characters, by the atmosphere of the surrounding Korea so well caught by cinematography and sound. Symbols are encountered in every scene, they trigger thoughts at first encounter, and call spectators back to try to put them together later. Reverences are made to classics of cinema but also of literature - Faulkner is mentioned explicitly, Chekhov implicitly. Acting is superb, the three actors in the leading roles do not seem to act, they live within their characters. 'Burning' is definitely a film that must be seen. Maybe also seen again.",Burning
11,gbill-74877,"Brilliant, but be patient with it",9,14 March 2020,"Jeon Jong-seo (who plays Hae-Mi) has some really beautiful moments in this film, including her pantomime routine, her mimicking the ""great hunger"" dance from the bushmen of the Kalahari, and the way she uses her hands to mimic a bird in flight at dusk, backlit by sunset. The ""great hunger,"" this hunger to understand the meaning of life, is such a poetic concept, and I just loved it. It fits in so well with these two disaffected young people, who both have such difficult relationships with their parents and face a harsh world.She tearfully says that a sunset in Africa made her want to disappear like the sunset, and her mother has disowned her until she pays off her credit card debt. Her friend Jong-su (Yoo Ah-in) has an angry father who is on his way to jail, and a mother who abandoned him long ago. When she sees her son again out of her own need, she can't stop herself from looking at her phone, which is a heartbreaking moment. He's an aspiring author who likes Faulkner, but is not sure what to write about. Is there any wonder he's so isolated and quiet? ""To me, the world is an enigma,"" he says.I absolutely love that little moment in her apartment, when we see an ephemeral reflection of light off the nearby tower glint and then fade, with is such a beautiful analogy to the beautiful little moments in an otherwise harsh world.There is certainly more than meets the eye here (from both a plot and allegorical perspective), as the two poorer young people are alongside this smooth rich guy (Steven Yeun) who drives a Porsche, knows the right things to say, and is always self-assured. Yeun is fantastic by the way, and his role is one of cinema's great villains. You can read larger things into these characters as life for young people these days, with the class divide and in existential moments, having a great hunger, the desire for an answer to the enigma of life.However the film certainly works on a literal level, and has wonderful ambiguity in it as well. It's a little lethargic in its first hour, but marvelous as it picks up. The buildup of tension by director Lee Chang-dong is masterful; the film gets eerie and scary without ever resorting to cheap shock moments. Great soundtrack and cinematography too. Highly recommended, but be patient with it.",Burning
12,nairtejas,Molecule Review: Burning (6 Stars),6,3 November 2018,"I could very much relate to the central character and his dispositions in Chang-dong Lee's Burning who becomes obsessed with his mysterious childhood friend and her even more mysterious new acquaintance who does not seem to be who he claims to be. Director Lee's slow-burning concoction (pun unintended) is a parable of sorts that tries to make its audience dive into the mind of the characters that are honest and dishonest at the same time. The build-up of the thriller drama is a pleasure to watch supported by a dreamy, nonchalant score and some great shots of countryside South Korea. And even better experience is the climax which will take some analysis on your part for you to make complete sense of it. And when you do make sense of it, you will find yourself sitting in your chair numb and unable to move. Burning is a silent attack on the philosophy of life and it's a pleasure best served in a 150-minute container. But not everyone will agree. TN.",Burning
13,Red-125,A beautiful woman with a cat and a boyfriend,10,7 February 2019,"The South Korean movie Beoning (2018) was shown in the U.S. with the title
""Burning."" It was co-written and directed by Chang-dong Lee. The film is based on a short story by award-winning writer Haruki Murakami.Ah-in Yoo plays Lee Jong-su, a young man who has graduated from college, but is unemployed. By chance, he meets a former high school classmate, the beautiful Shin Hae-mi, portrayed by Jong-seo Jun. She asks him to do her a favor--feed her cat when she travels to Africa.When she returns from Africa, she's accompanied by an extremely wealthy young man named Ben. (Despite his name, he's also South Korean.) Ben is portrayed by Steven Yeun.The story starts there, and quietly proceeds as we learn that something very strange is happening. Burning is really a thriller, but a thriller without guns or car chases.What matters is the psychology of the three young people, and the actions that their psychology brings about. The unpleasantness of the whole situation is there, but it's just below the surface.We saw this movie at Rochester's excellent Little Theatre. It will work well on the small screen.

14,howard.schumann,Brilliantly performed and impeccably directed,9,7 December 2018,"Outwardly unexpressive but inwardly volatile, Jongsu (Yoo Ah-in, ""The Throne""), a young delivery man, aspires to be a writer but does not write. He asks himself, ""What kind of story can I write?"" but he is an outsider looking to the world to provide a story for him. ""To me, the world is a mystery,"" Jongsu claims, but his attempts to unravel it only lead to his becoming more tightly wound. By providing an undercurrent of tension and increasing anxiety, Lee Chang-dong's (""Poetry"") Burning (Beoning), his first film in eight years, evokes the sense that something is very wrong, something in the air that cannot be defined but one that only the viewer can discover.Loosely based on the short story ""Barn Burning"" by Haruki Murakami, a work that references a 1939 story of the same name by William Faulkner, the film is set in the rural South Korean countryside near Paju City close to the North Korean border. Here, where Jongsu maintains his father's livestock farm while his dad faces trial for a violent outburst against a state official, state propaganda can be heard through blaring loudspeakers. The haunted look on his face lightens when he runs into Haemi (Jeon Jong-seo), an old school friend conducting a raffle in front of the store he is delivering to. Dressed in a mini-skirt, Haemi is warm and outgoing in her greeting though she tells Jongsu that his remark that she was ugly led to her having plastic surgery.Graciously, however, she invites him for dinner and some love making back in her apartment, albeit without much passion. About to embark on a trip to Africa to study the Kalihari Bushmen, Haemi asks Jongsu to look after her cat, appropriately named ""Boil."" He actually never sees the cat in her apartment, however, even though the food he lays out is gone every morning. The cat may or may not exist, nor are we certain that anything else in the film exists. In one scene, Haemi demonstrates her ability as a mimic by peeling and eating an imaginary orange, telling Jongsu that all it requires is the willingness to forget that the orange is not there.Weeks later, Haemi returns from Africa and asks Jongsu to pick her up at the airport, but without explanation, she arrives with a mysterious Korean, Ben (Steven Yeun, ""The Walking Dead""), an apparently wealthy dilettante who drives a silver Porsche and lives in an upscale apartment. When Jongsu asks Ben what he does, he replies only that he ""plays,"" prompting Jongsu's remark that South Korea's is filled with ""Great Gatsbys."" Oddly Ben also admits that he has never cried in his life. ""I can't remember ever shedding a tear,"" he says, ""so there's no proof of sadness."" Ben, who lives in the exclusive Korean district of Gangnam, regularly entertains friends and invites Jongsu to join him, but the young man remains at a distance, eyeing the intruder and his vague relationship with Haemi with jealousy and suspicion.Jongsu's discovery of a drawer in Ben's luxury apartment filled with a variety of female trinkets and other miscellany only raises more suspicion. One evening, Haemi, with arms stretching to touch the setting sun, performs an uninhibited dance she learned in Africa which depicts the ""Great Hunger,"" the need to penetrate the meaning of life. When Haemi falls asleep, the two men smoke pot together and Ben confesses that he is an odd habit of burning down old greenhouses, a hobby that he says brings him ecstasy, like ""a bass sound that rips to the bone,"" a sound reflected in the relentless score by Mowg (""The Witch: Part 1 - The Subversion"")Warning Jongsu that ""time takes away what isn't properly valued,"" things become even stranger when Jongsu receives repeated phone calls with no voice on the other end and Haemi is suddenly nowhere to be found. As Jongsu becomes more and more combustible in his search for Haemi, he feverishly attempts to unravel the riddle by staking out all the area's greenhouses in the blue light of early morning, but his quest remains elusive. When Ben tells him that there's ""no right or wrong, just the morals of nature,"" the film prepares us for its startling conclusion.In Burning, Lee makes us aware that, for many people, life is a party to which they haven't been invited. While the film has an element of class privilege and economic struggle, it is also a film that, under the surface, has a residue of undirected anger. According to Lee, ""the film references the anger and helplessness of young people today, and their sense that there is something wrong with the world that they don't quite realize or understand."" Brilliantly performed and impeccably directed, like many powerfully realized works of art, Burning will keep you pondering its implications for a long time.",Burning
15,TheMovieDiorama,Burning singes its psychological character study with a thrillingly igneous mystery.,8,6 November 2019,"The cosmic fires of the sun. Its radiance encapsulating our world with warmth and tenderness. The perfect distance for sustainability. Equilibrium. Its rich beating rays corrupting the impressionable youth, granting life in the most deciduous souls. The Sun sets. And much like its vanishing point, the resonance of its warmth dissipates, only leaving numbing bitterness.Chang-Dong's adaptation of Murakami's 'Barn Burning' is an arresting piece of psychology. An ambiguous analysis perceiving the wealthy to emotionally manipulate the aspiring, culminating into a study on the human condition. A complex aura of social anatomisation that defies the genres that are seamlessly blended. A story not entirely based on the perspective of the naive Jongsu, who faces solitude due to his mother abandoning him and father incarcerated. Neither does it revolve around the suggestible Haemi and her eternal yearning for disappearance as she travels to Kenya. Nor the ominous Ben, arriving back with Haemi after her trip, confessing his hobby for frequently burning down greenhouses.The enigmatic exploration comes from the gaps in between these surreptitious characters. The bonds they develop. Thematically, Burning is an endeavour in illustrating envy. The young envious of the rich. The lonely desirous of relationships. The insatiable hunger for perishing one's soul. A contemporary strand of human nature that is derived from Chang-Dong's acute screenplay. Substituting elongated conversations for hypnotising scenes of visual splendour, exercising his artistic flair for storytelling. Haemi, whilst enthused by marijuana, joyously dancing against the backdrop of the twilight sky in a one-take sequence. Not only does this depict her thirst for vanishment, as she sways to her claimed ""Great Hunger"" dance, but her eternal solidarity as the Sun sets in front of her darkened silhouette.In fact, Chang-Dong references the Sun throughout this ethereal piece, notably when Haemi invited Jongsu to her apartment. Its rays provide solace for her, but a shining memory for him. For the split second that the Sun reflects off Seoul Tower and through her quaint window, Jongsu habitually alters his psychology. The sheer power of its beauty has the ability to emotionally change the mind, and Chang-Dong poetically conveys that through showcasing the diamond sky. The cold pale blues complementing the warm pastel yellows, with much gratification for Kyung-pyo's cinematography. A battle for luminescence that likens itself to the internal conflict of subduing envy.Chang-Dong alters the slow-burning pace for the second half, introducing elements of mystery that makes this feature his most thrilling yet. Questionable plot points become answered through perceptible descriptions that offer an open-ended interpretation. What actually happened to Haemi? Chang-Dong purposefully refuses to literarily conclude that question, invoking your mind to fill in the blanks. A simple yet captivating device that opens its arms to the audience, bringing them closer to the characters than ever before.Occasionally, this seamless transition offers several plot points concluding in a quick manner, in particular the final ten minutes. Chang-Dong had a tendency for continuing the story which should've been finalised minutes beforehand, further losing the arresting power of Burning's thematic presence. Arguably, the conclusion offers a morality in fatherhood and how upbringing can alter justice, yet his insistence in clearly concluding the mystery was underwhelming. Offering a one-note ending. Juxtaposing the dimensionality of Ah-in, Jong-seo and Yeun's sensational performances throughout the runtime, and Mowg's multi-faceted score.Burning may not be the fiery inferno that viewers of traditional thrillers have come to expect. Far from it, in fact. Its purposeful slow-pace and meditative approach forces the audience to appreciate the finer details within the characters and environment. Offering allegories on classism and egalitarianism through an ambiguously visualised narrative that shines brightly amongst modern Korean cinema. Burning has its embers glowingly ferociously.",Burning

17,paul-allaer,Enticing mystery drama from South Korea,8,8 September 2018,"""Burning"" (2018 release from South Korea; 148 min.) brings the story of Jong-su. As the movie opens, he accidentally runs into Hae-mi, who he used to know back in the day when growing up in Paju (not far from the DMZ). They immediately hit it off. Hae-mi tells him that she is about to go on vacation to Africa, and would he mind taking care of her cat. Of course he agrees. When she returns from Africa and asks him to pick her up at the airport, he is very surprised to find out that she's not alone: Hae-mi has befriended Ben while in Africa... What is going on here exactly? To tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: this is the latest movie from South Korean director Lee Chang-dong. Here he brings us a mystery-thriller, the likes of which I haven't seen in recent years. Due to the plot-heavy nature of the film, I can't say a whole lot more, just watch! The director brings us some interesting real life tidbits (at Jong-su's family home in Paju, the North Korean propaganda speakers are clearly audible). Of the three lead performers, I was only familiar with Steven Yeun (as Ben). Surely we will see more of newcomer (and beautiful) Jeon Jong-seo (as Hae-mi). Keeping in mind that this movie runs 2 1/2 hrs., the movie just flew by for me.""Burning"" premiered at this year's Cannes film festival to positive buzz. I will go on record already and predict this movie will be nominated for the Best Foreign Language Movie Oscar early next year. I happen to see this movie while on a family visit to Belgium. The early evening screening where I saw this at in Antwerp, Belgium was attended so-so (about 10 people). The movie is slated for a limited US theatrical release in late October. If you are in the mood for an excellent foreign mystery-thriller, I'd readily suggest you check this out, be it in the theater (if you can), on VOD, or eventually on DVD/Blu-ray, and draw your own conclusion. For me, ""Burning"" is a WINNER all the way.",Burning
18,jtindahouse,A deep and intelligent movie that will have you pondering long after the credits roll,9,28 December 2019,"I absolutely love films like 'Burning'. 99% of films I watch are gone from my mind within an hour. It's that 1% that actually have the depth and capacity to make you think long after the credits have rolled that make the 99% worth sifting through. I knew nothing about 'Burning' going in. I think that is unquestionably the best way to watch it for the first time, although it almost guarantees you are going to need a second viewing. This is an incredibly smart film.The film runs nearly two and a half hours and yet I can't see it working as well if it wasn't that long. In hindsight, no scene or detail is wasted (before you are fully aware of what is going on you could be mistaken for thinking they were). 'Burning' respects its audience, almost to a fault. We are left to draw our own conclusions on things, but you almost need to be a genius to scrutinise everything the film presents. At the end of day though you really can't be wrong, so just have fun with it I suggest, I know I will.South Korea makes some terrific films and 'Burning' is just another one to add to the list. You'll have to excuse me now, I have to go and read hours worth of analysis and opinions on the film. 'Burning' is a treat, don't miss it.",Burning
19,jadavix,Good - interesting - too unwound to be thrilling,7,20 December 2018,"Toward the end of ""Burning"", I started getting that horrible feeling that the movie might end like a typical art movie, without resolving anything, or telling us anything. I was partly right: the main questions remain unanswered. However, the movie does have a devastating conclusion. I doubt anyone will leave disappointed in it.But what else?It's funny, because the movie has the ingredients for a successful thriller - most thrillers don't have that - but the pacing is so slow, and the movie too meandering, for it to really raise the pulse. The main character, also, is too inscrutable. I couldn't tell if he was supposed to be stupid, or psychopathic, though he does come into his own toward the end of the picture.However, the movie is always interesting, with several memorable dialogue exchanges, and the three main characters pique the interest. I say check it out.",Burning
20,kluseba,Strange brew,7,29 March 2019,"Burning had a quite strange effect on me. While I was watching the film, I thought it was long and tedious and at one point I even thought of stopping to watch it altogether. Especially the opening three fifths of the film are hard to sit through and the film's resolution isn't as spectacular as some people have claimed. Describing this movie as one of the greatest in Korean cinema would be an exaggeration given the fact that this country has made numerous absolutely outstanding films in the past two decades in particular.However, the more I thought about the movie once it had concluded, the more I appreciated it. The film includes numerous details despite its dragging pace and the plot asks more questions than it actually answers which gives attentive viewers food for thought and discussion.The storytelling is certainly unique as it can't be compared to anything I have ever watched before. It's much more ambiguous than other Korean dramas such as Park Chan-wooks lavish The Handmaiden or Im Sang-soo's The Housemaid with its cold social criticism. On the other side, the movie never drifts off into the realm of fantasy or science-fiction like Kim Ki-duk's quietly romantic 3-Iron or Park Chan-wook's heartwarming I'm a Cyborg, but That's OK. Burning is certainly one of a kind.The story revolves around three detailed characters or so it seems since the viewers only get the protagonist's at times questionable perspective of events. Lee Song-ju is a shy, lonesome and doubtful young man who performs odd jobs in town and takes care of his father's dilapidated farm when he is arrested for assault.The young man coincidentally meets a former childhood neighbour and classmate who helps him win a watch. Shin Hae-mi is outgoing and expressive but also socially awkward and quite naive. The two connect as they bond in their struggle with their social isolation while feeling attracted by their quite different and sometimes even opposite philosophies. One day, Shin Hae-mi travels to Africa and asks Lee Song-ju to take care of her cat that seemingly lives in her chaotic flat but is never to be seen.When she comes back after several weeks, she is accompanied by Ben whom she met during a crisis related to a terror warning abroad. Ben is sociable, smart and rich and quite the opposite of both Shin Hae-mi and Lee Song-ju. He seems to be well-mannered, intellectual and generous but is at times self-centered, mysterious and manipulative.One night, the three meet at Lee Song-ju's farm and smoke pot. Hae-mi takes off her shirt and performs an African dance expressing hunger for the meaning of life in front of the two men. Lee Song-ju admits to Ben that he is in love with Hae-mi. Ben also has something to confess and admits that he burns down abandoned barns once every two months. After their meeting, Shin Hae-mi departs with Ben and they leave Lee Song-ju behind. From that moment on, Lee Song-ju doesn't hear from Shin Hae-mi anymore. Her flat is in perfect order but has been abandoned. She hasn't shown up for her pantomime classes. Even her family hasn't heard of her and doesn't want to see her anyway because of her credit card debt. Lee Song-ju starts to believe that Ben might have murdered Shin Hae-mi and starts investigating.Several events in the movie raise questions that remain unanswered. Who is regularly calling Lee Song-ju in the middle of the night? How come he doesn't remember Shin Hae-min and her troubled past while she seems to remember everything about him? What is Ben's interest in the fairly average-looking Shin Hae-min when he is constantly surrounded by great-looking rich women of the high society? Does Ben really burn down barns? Does Shin Hae-min's cat actually exist? I have my own theories related to each of these and many other questions and the viewer must actively think about such elements in order to make sense of the movie. My interpretation might be completely different from someone else's interpretation of events. This makes the movie so interesting to discuss.In the end, Burning is a slow burn but its aftermath really sets things afire. While initially not appreciating the film, I feel like revisiting it with friends for second or even third opinions to discuss the story. This mystery drama has grown on me. I would recommend this film to people who consider themselves intellectual and patient. If you think Captain Marvel is the greatest film of the year so far, then Burning is certainly not for you.",Burning

They restart their relationship, w/he clearly more into it then she is & right off the bat she has him house-sitting her cat & picking her up from the airport (she has gone on a trip to Africa). That she returns w/a taciturn rich stud (Steven Yeun from the Walking Dead) unsettles our hero but he keeps his feelings to himself as they continue to be a threesome of sorts meeting for food or taking in the occasional dance club but then she disappears & his life takes a turn for the obsessive. Already a loner who fancies himself a writer (he cites Faulkner as his hero & even scribes a letter to get his imprisoned father out of jail), this mystery unfortunately fuels his life for the worse as he investigates his missing friend to no avail.

25,valleyjohn,A film that hangs around,8,30 April 2020,"The very first emotion I felt when the final credits went up on Burning was frustration . Frustration that I had just seen a movie that left more questions than answers but that emotion soon went and was taken over by admiration for Director Chang-Dong Lee's finished work because this is a film that sticks with you for quite some time.Burning is the story of Jongsu who bumps into an old friend, Haemi, on a part-time delivery job. Haemi asks Jongsu to take care of her cat while she leaves on a trip to Africa. When she returns, Haemi introduces Jongsu to Ben, a man she met in Africa. One day, Ben and Haemi pay Jongsu a visit, and Ben reveals his secret interests to Jongsu.
First and foremost it's a love story but at times it's not clear who Jongsu is actually in love with . It's also about social and economic inadequacies and how he feels inferior to Ben and all the things he can give Haemi and yet Ben takes it all in his stride which then leads to jealousy and rage .The film is beautifully shot . There is one scene in particular where Jongsu and Haemi have their one sexual encounter and the sunlight comes through the window for a brief moment and that represents their time together.This won't be for everyone because it makes the viewer work but after my initial frustration with it I found it most rewarding.",Burning
26,truemythmedia,The World is a Metaphor,10,25 July 2019,"To describe Murakami to someone who is not already a reader of his is difficult. I'm a huge fan of his work (I've read nine of his books so far and I own all of his books that have been translated into English), but any time I try to describe what reading him is like I fall short. Murakami likes to ascribe meaning to the mundane; ""The world is a metaphor,"" he says in one of my favorites of his works, Kafka on the Shore. Many scenes in Murakami's work feature protagonists doing trivial tasks like cooking food, listening to music, or gardening. But while his protagonists go about their lives, they find meaning in small things, in the small victories they win and also the small hurdles they have to overcome.Murakami's work has a sense of nirvana to it. Part of that sense comes from his prose (I've found some translations are better than others- Philip Gabriel's translations (1Q84) seem to flow more than Alfred Birnbaum's (Hard-boiled Wonderland and the End of the World)), but a good deal of it comes from Murakami's unique worldview that everything either has meaning or can be given meaning with context. Murakami might be talking about making pasta, organizing pots and pans, or even the joy of taking a very good poop (I'm not joking), but really he's addressing an existential crisis. He might be showing us a talking cat or a manifestation of Colonel Sanders or Johnny Walker (yes, that does really happen in one of his books), but he's asking us to push the boundaries of our metaphysical limitations. Murakami's work asks you to reexamine your own life and ascribe meaning to things that you might not have considered before- his work is life altering, transformative, and moving, but I also think it takes the right kind of mind to appreciate this kind of literature, just like it takes the right kind of viewer to appreciate films by Tarkovsky or Bergman. People who gravitate towards movies like this are searching for answers even if there aren't any answers to be found.It takes a mind that is hungry, not for food, but for a greater knowledge.For our full review of Burning and hundreds of other reviews, articles, and podcast episodes visit us at True Myth Media!",Burning
27,guisreis,The same issues from Parasite; but one year before and in a more fluid and subtle way,8,23 January 2021,"Very immersive and well done psychological thriller. Spectator feels unconfortable and curious throughout the movie, just as the main character, Jong-su, does. Colorful cinematography contrasts with cloudy and impenetrable minds of Haemi and Ben (particularly the latest). As Burning shares some traits with following-year Academy Awards winner Parasite, comparisons seem inevitable. Both are sucessful South Korean thrillers which deal in dramatic ways and throw weird stituations with critical social issues in capitalism in that country: the clash of classes, selfish and elitist upper class, lack of hope and opportunities for lower class people in general and, specifically, the unemployed youth. However, while Parasite has a perhaps brighter image as the metaphor, more subtle Burning is also more balanced and it drives to the end in a more fluid way.",Burning

29,EdgarST,Bluffing,6,6 April 2020,"Thanks to the quarantine, I finally saw ""Burning"". What a long and overrated movie! Based on a Japanese short story, it is not a bad film, it has inspired directorial moments, and a very good performance by the charmingly sinister Steven Yeun, but it's one of those movies that critics, the film ""intelligentsia"" and filmmakers, all addicted to Netflix (where they know what makes their subscribers tick), adore and excessively praise, because the ambiguous plots, mysteries, alleged murderers, psychological mazes and other clichés, all lead them to delirium... like Jong-su, the protagonist.Jong-su (Yoo) is a poor, reserved and humble boy, a product of a very dysfunctional family, with literary pretensions, and who is torn between beginning to write the novel that will accredit him as a writer, and his obsession with Hae-mi ( un), his ex-classmate, who is also poor, has mystical aspirations that she confuses with her primary eroticism, and who leads Jong-su to meet Ben (Yeun), a well-off man, of uncertain profession and with small tastes and secrets like anybody else. Meanwhile, boy and girl have to solve family matters and pay debts, and when she disappears, the film becomes a little livelier than the 90 previous minutes, following the stereotypical steps of the ""thriller"" that you have seen hundreds of times and... degenerating? into a kind of «Psycho»... a little more explicit.

The film is very obvious in the film, especially the two-party party. The whole film does not have a strong suspense. Just pay attention to the two details of the cat and the drawer, and you can basically understand the hidden chill. However, the whole film has many strengths. The female host is very special to the male owner, but she has invested in the embrace of the rich second generation. This setting always feels awkward; it is the second generation of the rich, which is very unreasonable. The biggest problem is that the ending is really bad, and the one-sided pursuit of drama conflict has led to a great decline in the depth of thought.

31,frankde-jong,The most thrilling film of 2018,9,3 August 2019,"""Burning"" is a great film where director Chang Dong Lee takes a short story of Haruki Murakami as a starting point, but greatly expands on it.Right from the beginning of the film, when Haemi (the girl) gives a pantomime performance to Jong su (her former neighbor boy and soon to be lover), it is made clear that truth versus illusion is one of the themes of this film. This theme re-emerges when Haemi asks Jong su to look after her cat when she is on holiday (Jong su never sees the cat during his visits) or when Heami tells about an accident of her childhood.After Haemi returns from her holiday with new friend Ben the theme of truth versus illusions seems to be replaced by the theme of the big contrast in Korean society. Ben drives a Porsche and is, especially considering his age, extremely wealthy. Moreover it is completely unclear where his money comes from. This drives Jong su to remark: ""Ben is like the great Gatsby, like there are so many great Gatsby's in South Korea"".Ben (a perfect role by Steven Yeun) is not only mysterious, he is also creepy with his cynical smile. Jong su distrusts him more and more, but with his old pick up truck he has of course no chance against the Porsche of Ben in the competition for Haemi.In a key scene Ben and Haemi visit Jong su at his place on the Korean countryside near the border with North Korea. While the three of them drink a glass of wine and smoke aj joint, the propaganda from the North Korean speakers can be heard in the balmy evening. Suddenly Haemi starts to dance on her own. While Jong su is hypnotized by her graceful movements and her beautiful breasts he sees Ben yawning in a bored fashion. His distrust turns to hate.With this hate the theme of truth versus illusions suddenly re-appears. After all, we see Ben through the eyes of Jong su. So is his creepiness real or is it fed by jealousy? Even the ending of the film does not answer this question.",Burning

the rich guy who forms one end of the love triangle is bored with his guests.feet fetish at 2:13:30. beautiful feet. better than any feet in ONCE.well, there is a mystery towards the end. its quite cleverly resolved. though i didnt like the ending. overall, i liked the shots of rural south korea. the acting was very good. but i do not like overtly meditative films like this one. films that take itself too seriously. i might have enjoyed it better if i watched it in a theater. but frankly, its very tough to keep watching this. there is almost no narrative punctuation. just 2.5 hours of mostly dullness and beautiful visuals.",Burning

This isn't your conventional mystery/thriller, rather a very good psychological drama that deliberately leaves a lot open to interpretation.In a way I was hoping for some sort of 'reveal' or explanation, but the more I think about it, the more I like the way the film ended. This film is more of a character and society study than anything else, and a fascinating one at that.The missing girl and what happened to her was never the focus of this film, and the sooner the viewer realises that, the more they will be able to appreciate it.

34,proud_luddite,Fascinating but maybe over-rated,7,9 December 2018,"Based on the short story ""Barn Burning"" by Haruki Murakami: in Paju, South Korea, Jong-su (Yoo Ah-in) is a young aspiring writer from a dysfunctional family doing odd jobs while also looking after the family farm nearby. He reconnects with a former classmate Hae-mi (Jeon Jong-seo) whose affections later turn to the very rich Ben (Steven Yuen). Ben's unusual character take everyone down a mysterious path.At two and a half hours, the film is perhaps too long especially as the first half begins to get dull at a certain point. This thankfully changes when the story and its energy get very mysterious. Here is where the film earns many points for its uniqueness and its subtle ways to lure the viewer into its web. In a good way, this segment is rarely frightening but always intriguing. Also, class difference plays a major role but without being obviously so.The audience is teased overall with only a minimal amount of information - just enough to understand while still yearning for more by the end.

36,gizmomogwai,Burning questions,9,4 February 2019,"Burning, the 2018 FIPRESCI Prize-winning film from South Korea, has a mysterious quality to it, and not just because this romantic drama-thriller also belongs (perhaps most of all) to the mystery genre. Slow paced, understated, it's the kind of film that can create tension in simple moments like silence, watching, following. It appears there could be a simple, straightforward solution: Ben is a serial killer who has murdered Hae-mi, and Jong-su is putting the pieces together. But is it that simple?1. What was the significance of Jong-su being a writer? Jong-su is trying to craft a novel; perhaps he's finding his subject as he goes. An elderly man (a career counselor?) remarks to Jong-su that protagonists are always ""crazy"". This may be telling the audience to ask questions about Jong-su himself. Ben also tells Hae-mi to ask Jong-su what a metaphor is. Why is that exchange in the film, and why are we being told to look for it?2. What is the significance of Hae-mi's well story? It sows doubt in Jong-su's mind about Hae-mi's honesty. He goes back and forth trying to find out if the story is true. Is it a literal truth or does it refer to a spiritual state?3. What is the significance of the ""Great Hunger"" theme? When Hae-mi describes an African sunset and her desire to disappear in it, the line is presumed to be innocent and is forgettable on first viewing. Does it provide any answers as to Hae-mi's disappearance?4. Why does Jong-su set fire to part of a greenhouse? He's frightened of what Ben can do, but comes close to doing it himself. Is Jong-su what he is afraid of?5. Why William Faulkner? Ask a literary expert, I don't know.6. Why the subplot of Jong-su's father being charged with assault? This doesn't fit in anywhere into the Ben-Hae-mi plot. A red herring? A useful explanation as to Jong-su's psychology?7. Why does Jong-su question whether Boil the cat lives only in Hae-mi's mind? He never sees Boil until at Ben's home. Is Boil a smoking gun or is he an illusion?8. What's the significance of North Korea being within sight of the main setting and their propaganda being in earshot? A sense of place, or perhaps a sign we should look at divisions in Korean society, a Korea with both struggling youth and Great Gatsbys.9. Why is Jong-su's military service mentioned so briefly? One wonders what we can learn from where he went, what he saw and what happened to him.10. Why the conversation on how the Chinese are like the Americans? We're directed to think about people who put them in the centre of everything and people considerate of others. Ben is the type who puts himself in the centre; is Jong-su too?With so many mysteries, Burning is the kind of film that demands repeated viewings and thought, a psychological mystery waiting to be decoded.",Burning

What I love is the final ambiguity and the director's willingness to let the viewer write his own ending.A great watch!,Burning

I liked him in ""Mayhem"" he did well in there . so i wanted him to pop in here ,, but i think as a first Korean experience he did fine.final thought,, the movie is absolutely what you want to see in a mystery genre film ,, so don't miss it .",Burning
39,rockman182,Burning (2018),8,24 November 2018,"I actually saw this over a month ago when it came to theaters but somehow forgot to write a review for it. I didn't know a whole lot but saw a lot of rave for it and saw promotion on social media for it from the Walking Dead's Steven Yeun. I didn't know a whole lot about the film but wow this film is quality. Its a slow burn, mystery that heightens and leaves a burning impression when the credits role. I think it'll be up there as a foreign feature during awards season.The film is about a young man in South Korea named Lee Jong-su. He one day reunites with a childhood friend named Hae-mi and falls for her. Life is good at first, though Hae-mi has some secrets to her. One day, during a trip Hae-mi meets a man named Ben who she brings back. Ben is well off, and rich and suave and this bothers Lee. Everything comes to a head, when Hae-mi mysteriously disappears without a trace. Lee tries to get to the bottom of it and is startled when he starts to discover what he sees as the truth.The film is very well performed on all fronts. Each character has so much going on. Lee seems average but he borders on obsessive and persistent. Hae-mi seems like a care-free spirit but has a downward loneliness. Ben seems like a charmer but may have deep dark secrets when peeled inside. The film is an intentional slow build and is beautiful to look at and presents with a profound nature. A lot of what is seen needs to be deciphered in the viewers mind and the film leaves an impression.Foreign films certainly deserve their share of love because of the creativity and sheer craft that is but into them. This South Korean film is a stand out of the year and leaves you bewildered and wanting more, even though the film itself is quite long. Go see this film as it is one of the best the year has to offer. The lingering thought of burning down green houses.8/10",Burning
40,eminkl,"Once the credits roll, you can't stop thinking about what you've just seen.",9,8 October 2019,"This film blew me away on a handful of fronts. I think Lee did a great job at effectively conveying the emotions of the characters. This was conveyed by a number of stylistic strategies such as the camera placement, the set design, and the acting. For instance, take Jong-Su's jealousy of Ben in the first half. Several sequences featuring Jong-su remaining silent as Ben and Hae-mi continue to chat and get to know each other around him, his various glances and remarks at the two which effortlessly capture subtle, yet firm expressions of alienation and melancholy, and all kinds of visual details which demonstrate how Ben is everything which Jong-su isn't succeed in getting under your skin far better than any direct statement of his jealousy would've been able to accomplish. Around the halfway point though, Ben confesses something to Jong-su which sends the film in a whole new direction (a change which is telegraphed to us by an abrupt and completely silent scene). This direction adds a consistent layer of slow burning suspense to the film which characterizes the rest of it. Throughout this part of the film, many indications that something is up are given to us as it goes on. In addition, Lee also makes us second guess a couple other details brought up earlier in the film which we believed to be true. As much as we (and Jong-su for that matter) hope to receive a definitive answer though, Lee refuses to supply us with one. He chooses to leave us hanging with a shred of doubt that we wish to see satisfied throughout the second half. Since the film is told from the point of view of Jong-su though, we go along and side with him. Does he do the right thing at the end though? The shred of doubt we've had throughout is what makes the payoff so effective. Once the credits roll, you can't stop thinking about what you've just seen.",Burning

45,ronakkotian,Understated in its storytelling,9,31 August 2021,"South Korean cinema has some really great films. I've discovered directors like Bong Joon-Ho and Park Chan-wook who've created outstanding movies and joining them now is Lee Chang-dong.Burning follows Jong-su, a man who meets his childhood friend, Hae-mi, after a long time. After coming back from her trip to Africa, Hae-mi introduces Jong-su to Ben, a mysterious man with a strange hobby.Burning is one of those films that people may adore or be frustrated by. This isn't a film that provides many answers to its questions but the ambiguity is what made me fall in love with this film. The way Lee Chang-dong constructed this twisted story is so clever by having the audience see the story through Jong-su's perspective. He's in pretty much every scene and we see and react to the world in the same way he does. This works so well as the film gets more sinister and further suspicious starts to arouse, we see all of this from Jong-su's point of view that leads us to speculate in one direction. However, what we could be seeing may be a coincidence or not as it seems and that's where many interpretations can be made about the characters and situations. It's amazing how well thought out the characters and events are as it leaves just enough hints so the answers aren't very obvious. The overall structure and presentation of Burning adds to the intrigue. The way the story shifts tone is beautifully done and takes us through scenes that come across unexpectedly, adding to the mystery and suspense. The score by Mowg is very strange and makes the atmosphere very haunting, especially during the second half where the tension seemingly builds. The cinematography is also terrific. There is one extremely beautiful long take that captures the beauty of the landscape so well that's it's hypnotising.The performances by the three main actors are all fantastic. Yoo Ah-in is terrific in the kead role as Jong-su. The shy and suspicious nature of his character was communicated really well by him. I've known Steven Yeun for starring in American films so to see him speaking and starring in a Korean film is something different. He does a really good job maintaining the mysterious aspect of Ben and gives off expressions in such a natural way. Just a shot of him yawning after Jong-su looks at him is done in such a compelling and natural way. Jeon Jong-seo is also really good here as Hae-mi. For her film debut especially, she's really convincing in the role and has a lot of potential for the future.Burning is one of the most fascinating films I've seen recently. Lee Chang-dong has really proven his filmmaking talent here. With its abundance of themes, audience manipulation tactics and a heavy sense of atmosphere, Burning is a film that'll stay in my head for months to come.",Burning
46,andrewroy-04316,"Thick with ambiguity and slowly building tension, Burning is carefully crafted and psychological, leaving the viewer with questions and theories rather than answers",9,20 August 2019,"Burning is an extremely well made film, but one that doesn't offer clear explanations, instead opting for complexity and many interpretations. It's a slow burn, intimately personal film investigating three characters, and all three give very strong performances. The genre and main idea is hard to pin down, because there are so many ways to interpret the movie. It could be a missing person mystery, or a psychological journey where a character spirals into paranoia, or a purely metaphorical rumination on class where each character is playing their own game. There's enough evidence to support any number of theories about who Hae-Mi really was, what Ben was really doing, and what happened to Hae-Mi. The reason it's so challenging to be convinced of one theory is that every event we see is through the warped perspective of Jong-Su, who has plenty of biases in play. I still ultimately believe that Ben was killing the girls, toying with them for his amusement and killing them when he got bored with them, because we saw how he loved power and controlled everything in his life. He targeted girls on the outskirts of society - the ""greenhouses"" that are abandoned - because they are easy to manipulate. I do think there's a convincing case that Hae-Mi committed suicide, especially considering the last words Jong-Su spoke to her were likening her to a prostitute. A key quote that could support either theory is Hae-Mi's words about Jong-Su, saying he's the only person she trusted and she cared deeply for him. To me, this sounds like something she says when she realizes the monster that Ben is, but it could also be something of a suicide note, expressing her appreciation for a friend as she was about to kill herself. I was so hung up on who she really was and what the deal with the well was, but I've come around to the idea that that was all a red herring and while there's no way to know whether it happened or not (it could be an event she remembered fondly but was minor to Jong-Su, or she could've made it up as she wanted a connection to him), it is likely a class metaphor in feeling like she's at the bottom of society. I've even seen the surprisingly convincing case made that Ben was purely toying with both of them. Jong-Su is just as much an abandoned greenhouse as Hae-Mi, and maybe when he said ""I play"", he really meant he is on an entirely different socioeconomic class than them and is a playboy who entertains himself with the emotions of others (like finding it fascinating when others cry). The social class themes are resonant and clearly play into all of the relationships among the three of them. One other element that was great was the cinematography - some of the wide pans, zoom outs, and landscapes were gorgeous and framed the viewer's perspective, making it among the most effective cinematography I've seen in a film. While I was frustrated with the movie while watching it because it was never clear what was going on, even at the end, as I look back on it and see the larger picture it's quickly growing on me as something close to a masterpiece, with lots of relevant commentary and so much to dissect. Be ready to consider every detail, because Burning is meticulously crafted.",Burning

Of course Stephen Yeun is wonderful in a finely intricate performance, but so is Korea's brilliant Yoo Ah-In who carries the film. This is a work that leaves questions wrapped within enigmas: is the cat alive or dead in the box, or both, or imagined; or is the whole thing a novel unfolding from the mysteries of the world.

Lots of elements in this movie have a double or mysterious meaning, that's never explained. While you can go read an explanation afterwards on the internet, the viewing is unsatisfying. The director plays too much on the doubt without ever giving a hint. So I was wondering till the end if I should interpret it myself, or wait for the explanation that never came. This is a rather basic and serious mistake in moviemaking, or, alternatively, some kind of a narrative fraud. If you're playing with meaning of things, you have to tell the audience!

52,politic1983,Slow burner,8,18 February 2019,"Recently watching Yukiko Mishima's ""Dear Etranger"" - where an everyday male is pushed to his limits, but rather than exploding violently, returns to a calm after a passive aggressive outburst - I was struck by the hero's choice to keep on the straight and narrow, rather than let that tension get the better of him. Based on the Haruki Murakami short ""Barn Burning"" (and also William Faulkner's story of the same name), ""Peppermint Candy"" director Lee Chang-dong chooses to let that tension out violently, allowing it to boil to an inevitable conclusion.Adapting the character backgrounds, their interactions, however, are reasonably faithful to the original short. Jong-su (Yoo Ah-in) is somewhat of a lowly figure in Seoul. A farmer's son, he works low-level jobs while holding his ambition of becoming a writer. By chance he meets an old school friend from his farming village, Hae-mi (Jun Jong-seo) and the pair get chatting, meeting on several occasions before consummating their born-again friendship. But, having saved some money, she intends to travel to Africa, asking Jong-su to take care of her (non-existent) cat.On her return, following an attack on the airport in Nairobi, Hae-mi returns, though not alone. Asking him to meet her at the airport, Jong-su is surprised to see her accompanied by the suave Ben (Steven Yeun); the trio then going for a meal together. Intrigued by his writing, Ben often accompanies Hae-mi whenever she meets up with Jong-su. Though feeling uneasy about being the third wheel and out-of-place among Ben's high society friends, Jong-su is also suspicious of Ben's wealth for one so young and mysterious about his earnings.His father imprisoned for a violent outburst, Jong-su has to return to his family farm to tend to its needs. It is on the farm, after smoking some weed together, that Ben reveals to Jong-su his passion for burning greenhouses: ones simply asking to be burnt down. This only adds to the man's mystery. Indicating that he has found his next ""victim"" nearby to Jong-su's farm, Jong-su is obsessive in trying to figure out which it will be. After receiving a call from a distressed Hae-mi, she subsequently disappears, leaving him to obsessively pursue Ben in order to find answers to both Hae-mi's whereabouts and the puzzle of the next greenhouse.The first thing to note about ""Burning"" is that it is long. At two-and-a-half hours with a slow pace, Lee allows a long of time for the suspense to rise, which he does well. Jong-su's life is coming to a low point: his dad in prison, taking over a failed farm and no clear career path or love life to speak of. Almost as if researching for a novel, he plots the possibilities for Ben's next barn attack, as well as staking out his home - this has become what he lives for. But the length doesn't drag too much; come the end, you are searching for numerous answers. ""Burning"", much like the Japanese short story, leads a lot of open ends and leaves it up to you to piece them together.Ben is the anti-Jong-su: successful, confident and full of mystery. Steven Yeun plays him adeptly; his time in America giving him an aura of the foreign in Jong-su's world. His charm and seeming boredom at Hae-mi - the nature of their relationship unclear, as it is with his subsequent love interest - make Jong-su question what his exact motives are, fuelled by his story of burning greenhouses. Was this merely a stoned prank, or is there a much more sinister man lying beneath? He is fully under Jong-su's skin.Ben is almost calling Jong-su to act. A man of mystery, he seems as if he doesn't even know himself, living the high life, but without any real purpose. As in his interview in Sight & Sound, Lee wanted to show the difficulties for today's youth in South Korea. Jong-su has nothing but intentions and feels unable to act on them; while Ben has everything but no sense of purpose. Jong-su's final act is the rage of the have-nots against the haves.The ending may feel somewhat inevitable by the time it comes, but much like Jong-su's obsession, the longer you leave it and the more you mull it over, the more intriguing it gets. Having re-read the short after, as well as adding the ending, Lee adds a greater sense of mystery, obsession and social comment. What starts as a burning candle, explodes like a firework.",Burning

54,TheVictoriousV,South Korea delivers again,8,4 June 2019,"The films of South Korea, as a general statement, are so good and unrestrained it's eye-opening. You're reminded of the sort of suffering - psychological at least as much as physical - cinema COULD depict, but typically does not dare (look no further than YMS's comparison between the original Oldboy and its abysmal remake). The violence of Korean cinema is rarely mindless or without purpose, however, not that a devoted fan of Braindead would mind that sort of thing.Either way, the South-Korean film of today shares little in common with the brutality of Chan-wook Park, but is great, unrestrained, and upsetting in all sorts of other ways. Burning, by Lee Chang-Dong, goes all the way in its invention of characters - all of them, even those in the background, seeming so real it's eerie - as well as the coordination and aesthetics of the camera work.It all begins when the awkward Lee Jong-su (Yoo Ah-in) encounters a young woman (Jeon Jong-seo) who introduces herself as his childhood friend Shin Hae-mi. They grow closer and eventually make love in Hae-mi's unkempt flat, right before she has to leave for Kenya. Jong-su agrees to feed her cat while she is away, although the feline itself is never seen or heard.Later, Hae-mi becomes stuck at Nairobi Airport due to a terrorist threat, but eventually returns to Paju alongside the enigmatic Ben (Steven Yeun of The Walking Dead). The three begin to bond, but there is a tinge of jealousy in the air (never quite explicit yet well-communicated all the same), and Jong-su has trouble remembering his past the way Hae-mi describes it. Ben also reveals an unusual hobby of his.Overall, the first half is slow (perhaps too slow at times) and doesn't seem too threatening, outside of the phone calls Jong-su receives when looking after his incarcerated father's farmhouse with no-one speaking on the other end. It is hard to foresee how unsettling this tale ultimately gets.It reminded me of a Michael Haneke film, not only in how expertly Lee Chang-Dong directs his actors, the big roles as well as the small, but also in how it leaves us without concrete answers, but with just the right number of clues to leave us pondering over the mystery after the film ends. I saw it a while ago; I still feel the unease left by its ending and am still thinking of solutions.Released in my homeland in January, this was originally a 2018 movie, shortlisted for the Oscar of Best Foreign Film but wound up not getting nominated. I read that it is the first South Korean film to be on the shortlist, which is surprising given South Korea's output of cinema. Maybe it frightens most westerners? Is this why this one wasn't nominated?The movie has nonetheless been praised, and not only for the reasons I've listed above. I agree with the criticism that it captures the struggles of youth more fairly than, say, any Hollywood film where broke youngsters can apparently still afford spacious apartments. However, I am no authority on whether it also captures the hardships of being a woman in modern-day South Korea. Supposedly it does, and I shall take the experts' word for it. Some have complained about the depiction of Hae-mi, but more reliable sources tell me she is more than a mere plot device within a mystery.",Burning
55,Gresh854,An Exceedingly Unorthodox Mystery Film,9,11 November 2018,"Chang-dong Lee's Burning is the preeminent slow-burn that, abnormally enough, doesn't gratify you with the conclusions you would forsee it to have like most slow-burns bequest. It's a continuous congestion of percolating anxiety that keeps you intimately padlocked.Having the opportunity to ordeal the point-of-view of a main character situated like Lee Jong-su, enables this allocation of an intensive urgency for answers. This furthermore, nearly spawns as much conflict and turmoil with yourself-or oneself-as it does with our main lead thanks to Burning's monopolizing storyline.And only-yes, only-a climax like Burning has the moxie to erase every little fabrication you ever had devised from your burgeoning little cortex, leaving you with nothing but this insidious twinge of desolation.The subtle emptiness of Burning's etching nightmare of the uncharted is what makes it emerge compared to any other mystery conundrum.

56,Bertaut,"A slow-burning mystery about economics, class, and sexual jealousy. And cats.",8,16 February 2019,"A thriller about a missing person. An allegory of class division. A study of generational alienation. A fable about modern consumerism. A dramatisation of psychological breakdown and genetically inherited rage. An analysis of socio-economic disenfranchisement. A critique of toxic masculinity and its concomitant misogyny. A condemnation of middle-class gentrification. A threnody for a traditional Korea that's slowly being replaced by faceless cosmopolitanism. An extended rib on Schrödinger's cat. Beoning is all of these. And none of them. This is a narrative fundamentally built on questions, very few of which are answered definitively.In his first film in eight years, writer/director Chang-dong Lee begins this protean narrative as an almost high school-esque teen romance, before shifting gears into a story of sexual and economic jealousy, then morphing into the tale of a pseudo-film noir amateur sleuth, before finally allowing itself to visit the thriller territory that has lurked just outside the frame since the opening few scenes. Essentially a psychological drama about three people, although it's possible that only one of those people is real. There are also two cats. Or maybe only one cat. It's a long journey (148 minutes), and, for some, the payoff won't be worth the length of time taken to get there. Others, more used to concrete black-and-white yes-and-no narratives, will be unimpressed with how steadfastly the film refuses to yield its secrets. However, it has an undeniable ability to burrow under your skin, with Lee bestowing portentous significance upon the most inanimate of objects, only to later reveal that whilst we were trying to figure out the importance of item a, we missed the significance of item b.Adapted by Lee and Jungmi Oh from Haruki Murakami's 1983 short story ""Barn Burning"", which is itself loosely inspired by William Faulkner's 1939 short story of the same name, Beoning is set in contemporary South Korea, and tells the story of aspiring novelist Lee Jong-su (Yoo Ah-in). Working as a part-time delivery man in Seoul, he encounters Shin Hae-mi (Jeon Jong-seo), who claims they went to school together, although he doesn't remember her. Telling him she will shortly be travelling to Africa, she asks him to feed her cat, Boil. He agrees, and the two have sex. Jong-su happily feeds Boil, and even though every time he comes to the apartment, the cat is nowhere to be seen, the food and water are disappearing. A few weeks later, she returns with Ben (Steven Yeun), a confidant, irritatingly polite, and extremely wealthy young man. The trio develop an odd relationship, and one evening, Jong-su admits to Ben that he loves Hae-mi, and Ben tells him about his strange hobby of burning greenhouses. A few days later, Hae-mi disappears, and Jong-su, suspecting Ben, sets out to find her.Beoning is masterfully constructed upon a foundation of questions, only a very few of which are answered. Some of the bigger questions include, why does Jong-su not remember Hae-mi from school; what happened to Hae-mi; what does Ben do for a living; is his admission that he has never cried evidence of sociopathy; does he really burn down greenhouses? There are also a whole host of smaller mysteries running alongside - why does Hae-mi seem to rig a raffle so that Jong-su wins; what exactly did Jong-su's father do (when the film begins, he is standing trial on a vague assault charge); who is calling Jong-su's home in the middle of the night and hanging up; why does he stare at his father's knives the way he does; where is his sister; does Boil exist; is Ben's rescue cat the same cat as the never-seen Boil; did Hae-mi really fall down a well as a child? Some (or more) of these questions remain unanswered, although there are certainly clues scattered throughout.Thematically, the film covers a plethora of issues; toxic masculinity, alpha and beta males, economics and consumerism, class, the place of women in Korean society, sexual jealousy, the death of a bucolical way of life, working-class privations, faceless capitalism, the price of success, hope, writer's block. Of course, some are more foregrounded than others, with economics in particular emphasised. For example, the film cuts from a scene of the trio at a swanky nightclub (into which Ben has ensured they could go) to a scene of Jong-su alone, mucking out the cow stable. The contrast between the lifestyles of the two men couldn't be clearer. Jong-su belongs to a generation of working-class people who will be economically worse off than their parents were at the same age, whilst the gap between the middle-class and the working class has grown wider than ever. The Korea of the film is very much a place of castes, hierarchies of privilege and social standing, with Jong-su and Ben on the opposite end of every spectrum.The film also engages significantly with gender politics. One of the things that so captivates Jong-su about Hae-mi is her provocative behaviour. Yet later, when she dances topless outside his house, he is disgusted, telling Ben, ""only a wh-re acts like that."" It's a succinct summary of a societal double-standard; men can behave how they wish, but women must conform to arbitrary expectations. It could be argued that Hae-mi functions primarily to further Jong-su and Ben's arcs, and is devoid of any real agency herself. An alternative reading, however, is that she is poorly sketched as a character so as to represent a patriarchal society in which women are seen as less complex than men. For the most part, Beoning avoids didacticism on this issue, but to suggest that Hae-mi is simply a badly written character seems to me to be a very superficial interpretation of a film with great depth.However, there is also the possibility that Hae-mi doesn't actually exist, and in this sense, the fact that she is presented in such sexualised terms is because she is literally a male's fantasy, a sexual obsession born in the disturbed mind of an unreliable narrator. The film is told exclusively from Jong-su's perspective, he is in every scene, and the narrative never shifts to another focal character or to an omniscient viewpoint. With this in mind, everything we see is filtered through his ideological outlook; if he attaches significance to an object, the audience is invited to do likewise. Lee masterfully handles this tricky structural device, placing the audience directly into the same (possibly paranoid) headspace as the character. So, for example, when Jong-su sees Ben yawning as Hae-mi is recreating a dance she learned in Kenya, the yawn becomes immensely sinister, because that's how Jong-su interprets it. In this sense, if one theorises that Hae-mi is, in fact, a figment of Jong-su's imagination - an idealisation of a beautiful woman who wants him - then Ben must also originate in Jong-su's mind, functioning as the inverse to Hae-mi; a personification of everything to which Jong-su aspires, but is unable to attain. The fact that Lee leaves this tantalising possibility on the table whilst still managing to analyse social-realist topics such as economics and class, is a testament to his extraordinary control over the material.One of the most salient motifs, if not necessarily a theme unto itself, is that of disappearance, with references scattered throughout the film - Hae-mi notes that her childhood home is gone, as is the well she fell into; Jong-su recollects how after his mother abandoned the family, his father burnt her clothes; when Ben tells Jong-su about his greenhouse hobby, he states, ""you can make it disappear as if it never even existed""; Hae-mi literally says she wants to disappear; when Jong-su asks Ben if it's possible Hae-mi has gone on another trip, Ben says, ""maybe she disappeared like a puff of smoke"". The most important scene in this sense is an early one. Explaining that she's learning pantomime, Hae-mi proceeds to mime peeling and eating a tangerine, telling Jong-su the trick isn't to pretend the tangerine is really there, but to ""forget it doesn't exist"". This challenge to perception is crucial not just in how Jong-su becomes convinced Hae-mi has met foul play despite the lack of evidence, it also provides a clue for the audience as to how best to parse the film itself.Of course, for all that, there are a few problems. For one, it's a little too long, and there are occasions when the narrative seems somewhat desultory. I would imagine that a lot of people will also dislike the ambiguity. Personally, I loved this aspect and thought Lee handled it magnificently, but it certainly isn't for everyone. A minor issue is that as protagonists go, Jong-su is extremely passive, a character to whom things happen rather than the narrative's driving force. Again, some people will dislike this aspect, but I think it's important that Jong-su is depicted this way, especially in relation to the final scene. Of that scene, it could be seen as disappointingly familiar, something seen in any number of standard genre pieces. I disagree with that, but I can see where the criticism is coming from, as it does conform neatly to the rubric of a quotidian thriller.All in all, I found Beoning to be a haunting film, one which I couldn't get out of head for days, and I'm keen to see it again. Lee's masterful control of tone is extraordinary, balancing a plethora of themes within a half-social-realist/half-magic-realist milieu. As good an exercise in cinematic suggestiveness as you're likely to see, Lee subtly alters mood so as to manipulate, push, prod, guide, and fool the audience. The film is such that everything on screen, every word spoken, every background detail could be important. Or not. Fiercely intelligent, deeply nuanced, complexly layered, it's a film that rewards concentration. It is, simply put, the finely crafted work of a distinct and relevant auteur.",Burning

59,ctowyi,A hypnotic menagerie of the basest of human behaviour,9,17 October 2018,"Terms like ""masterpiece"" and ""breathtaking"" are used far too often, yet they define Lee Chang-dong's latest, eight years after his brutally lyrical Poetry (2010). However, Burning, based on Haruki Murakami's short story Barn Burning, is not an easy film to watch. Allusive and elusive, it begins as a brilliant character study and gradually shifts its gear segueing into psychological thriller territory.Jong-su (Yoo Ah-in), a part-time worker, bumps into Hae-mi (Jun Jeong-seo) while delivering, who used to live in the same neighborhood. Hae-mi asks him to look after her cat while she's on a trip to Africa. When Hae-mi comes back, she introduces Ben (Steven Yuen), a mysterious guy she met in Africa, to Jong-su. One day, Ben visits Jong-su's with Hae-mi and confesses to him during a pot session that he burns abandoned greenhouses. In anticipation of the film, I re-read the Haruki Murakami's short story taken from the anthology The Elephant Vanishes. Like a lot of his works, the story feels cryptic, simple on the surface, surreal once it gets under your skin. There is a mystery but Murakami doesn't quite persuade you to penetrate beneath the veneer. I certainly didn't think for one second it could be adapted into a film because there doesn't seem to be much of a plot at all. My wife shared the same sentiment. We were all the more curious as to what Lee could distill from this intriguing short story.Like Murakami's distinctive prose, Lee's Burning retains the other-worldly surreality through arthouse pacing and artful cinematography. The first act moves at a languid pace as we observe Jong-su's infectious reticence and Hae-mi's enthusiastic flamboyance. It is an unlikely match, but you will sense the possibility of a sweet romance. They long to cling near one another like satellites, but they will never share the same orbit because forming the third vertex of the triangular relationship is Ben, the coolly detached upper-class, the spanner in the works, the Great Gatsby.As much as the first act plays like a meditative dance of a fever dream and an elegy for lost innocence, I also recognise that it will be divisive. I have a feeling most filmgoers won't have the patience to sit through it and be emotionally vested in the characters. Lee may be an extraordinary image maker, gently probing deep into the human psyche, its desires and impulses, but the story feels opaque, dense, resembling an enigma. But if one is a serious filmgoer, it is easy to slip into Lee's rhapsodic wonder of a tale, patiently waiting for the bomb to drop. It is when the head film becomes a mind film in the second act that it pays dividends tenfold.If Murakami's short story feels deceptively simple, Lee takes it into the nether region of complexity. He unravels what it means to be consumed by a mystery and what it means to be alive. The production is meticulously artful - ponder over how Jong-su's home is a stone's throw from the border of both Koreas and how propaganda is blaring every other hour, and ravel in the beautiful light of the sunset as Ben shares his unusual hobby. Lee is able to externalise the interior states of the human mind in extraordinary ways. The subtext of social classes in the Korean society also plunges a knife into one's consciousness. He is also helped by a unique soundtrack of discordant musical cues that grow in mysterious power as the story grows in stature. Lee builds the final act to a feverish high and he almost wants to deny us the satisfaction of a resolution, but it does arrive at an ending that is shocking and inevitable. There is no celebration; there is only the quiet satisfaction of arriving at the solution of a baffling Math problem that has nagged at you for many sleepless nights.Lee fills every frame with meaning, enhanced and accentuated in no small part by the three superb leads. He priorities rhythm and texture over narrative clarity, immersing us in a hypnotic menagerie of the basest of human behaviour. Burning is an engrossing tale of the unravelling of a rational and innocent mind by sheer desire, rich with characterisations and themes. It is a Korean film unlike any other Korean film I have seen and it immediately warrants a second or third viewing to catch all the nuances. I hope I don't have to wait another eight years for his next film.",Burning
60,grandmastersik,An hour shorter and it could have been amazing,5,10 February 2020,"As Salad (a band most band of you have never heard of) once sang: Nothing happens in this town, Nothing moves.That's the problem with this film: nothing happens, it never seems to go anywhere... after a while you'll likely start checking the clock. I almost turned this film off just past the hour mark because it was pretty boring and, Hae-mi, the female lead, was annoying, not relatable in any way whatsoever and, frankly, she was driving me mad, dancing around semi-naked, stoned.But - for some unknown reason - I persevered (and believe me: no-one should judge you if you don't).In the end, Jung Su, the naive country-boy, starts to come to life (oh, did I forget to mention that he'd basically done nothing up until this point?). The film meanders along and then, BAM! One of the best endings I've seen in recent memory.Then again, I watch a lot of films and, sadly, most nowadays are crap.So, whether the ending is enough to make someone award this snooze-a-thon 10/10 is debatable, but IMDb is full of stuoid idiots and pretentious idiots alike.

His subtle but convincing acting choices really bring life, not only to his character, but also to the entire scenes he's in. This film is definitely not what I thought it was going to be, and I'm glad it was able to surprise me.To me, Burning is a beautiful car in flames, in the distance, slowly heading in your direction.

It even makes the story more enjoyable when you read it again, making this one of my favourite Murakami adaptations.
A brilliant cast and quality direction definitely make the film beautiful and intriguing. Jong-seo Jun is amazing in her feature debut, and the depth of her acting may bring a tear to your eye. Her pantomine scene is mesmerising. Ah-in Yoo plays the socially awkward and uncertain male lead, who really isn't sure who to trust and how to pursue his suspicions as the story moves from a romantic drama into a mysterious thriller. Steven Yuen does a fantastic job as the slick, overseas Korean rich boy.

67,domtaylor,The rare film that gets its value upon reflection.,8,7 February 2019,"It's the rare film that gets its value upon reflection rather than during watching. It's not boring as such, but with its extremely long runtime it does generally feel slow paced and often runs the risk of being quite dull. Luckily though, the pure sense of mystery that surrounds the three core players (our protagonist included) and the film's world as a whole keeps things intriguing throughout. As the narrative progresses, however, and the core mystery of the piece arrives, things get a lot more intriguing and this intrigue lasts long after the haunting finale. That's where the film really gets its merit. None of the enigmas are definitively answered, and this leads to an extremely subtle - yet wholly rewarding - experience that allows you to draw your own conclusions of what it was actually about. The picture could be about several different things, and it all depends on the individual spectator response. This, as well as the complete lack of on-the-nose exposition, is very refreshing in today's age of cinema where nothing is left to the imagination anymore. We are not told, or even explicitly shown, anything integral to answer the core mystery and this allows you to reflect on all of the intricacies of several different scenes in order to draw your own conclusions. It really is a one of a kind experience that will leave you scrutinising for days, discovering a new narrative possibility upon every thought. Its slow pace and the sense that it's not really going anywhere might make it seem hard to get through initially, but once it's over it becomes a rich, rewarding experience. 8/10",Burning

Usually, the overall score on IMDb can be relied upon as a true reflection of a movie's worth but just occasionally the majority of IMDb scorers and reviewers get it horribly wrong, as they did here. Regrettably, I didn't trouble to watch the trailer before I shelled out cash to buy this one.
I am at the same time offended by having been so (accidentally) misled and a little bit pissed off at having wasted the money needed to buy this and the time needed to watch it.

71,cappiethadog,Remain in light,10,2 November 2019,"""Oh, this is nothing. Talent's not involved. It's not a question of making yourself believe there 'is' an orange there, you have to forge there isn't one,"" Shin Hae-mi(Jeon Jong-seo) explains to Lee Jong-su(Yoo Ah-in) in a coffee shop pretending to peel and eat a mandarin orange. Filmmaker Lee Chang Dong lifts the scene, whole, and its dialogue, verbatim, from international novelist Haruki Murakami's ""Barn Burning"", from the short story collection ""The Elephant Vanishes"", in the 2018 Palm d'or-nominated film ""Burning"", a metaphysical film about the fallibility of mankind. The audience will have to wait for Chang Dong's next move, but for the time being, ""Burning"" seems to be the penultimate film of a trilogy about God's silence. Published in 1993, ""Barn Burning"" encompasses ""Secret Sunshine"". Chang Dong's 2007 film about a grieving woman whose motherhood is cut short, who finds the grace, then loses her faith in God. In ""Burning"", there is a visual echo, the mystery of things unseen in the light, that may or may not shelter the divine.Life, in ""Secret Sunshine"", isn't perfect for Shin-ae(Jeon Do-yeon), far from it. Recently widowed, she moves to her late husband's hometown, Miryang, with her young son, Jun(Seon Yung-Yeob), in order to start over. This Seoul woman doesn't know that her best laid plans will result in funeral plans. Shin-ae lets it be known, at all times, that she is from the big city, and won't suffer fools gladly. Jong-chan Kim(Kang-ho Song) is one such fool, a lonely bachelor who will do anything for Shin-ae, going so far as joining her church. She wants to be the big fish in a small pond; she tells these provincials what to do, as if a Seoul woman's opinion is the only one that matters. Class warfare is incited when she tells a small business owner to redecorate the shop. And later, within earshot of a lunch party, she announces her plans to buy a plot of land, arrogantly adding: ""It's better than earning small interest in a savings account."" It doesn't work the other way around; the pharmacist's wife, hardly her equal, has the gall, the uninstructed temerity to ignore their differing socio-economical echelons, and tells Shin-ae, a classically-trained pianist. about God.The mother's lack of humility gets her son murdered.Even after Jun(Jung-yeop Seon) is discovered near a stream, the atheist still rebuffs the pharmacist's wife's offer of fellowship. The older woman argues: ""You see everything the naked eye can't see. You doubt what you can't see."" God is in the eye of the beholder. To Shin-ae, it's just sunlight, nothing more, that pours through the pharmacy window. It's sunlight still, or something more, in the film's last shot, a prolonged one, that frames an empty container, weeds, dirt, and a puddle of water, asking you to see God, and ignore Shin-ae's blindness.Does cat exist? That's the burning question in ""Burning"". Light is here, but light plays a different role, more earthbound, nothing less than electromagnetic radiation, which bounces into Shin-Hae's room off the Seoul Tower, but ""only for a moment"", something akin to a spasm. Light in ""Burning"" isn't the same light in ""Secret Sunshine"", because there's nobody around to signify the ecclesiastical possibilities. It has more to do with romantic love, the affinity for flesh, not pious love, the hunger for fish, the ichthys. In junior high, Shin-hae longed for Lee Jong-su's attention. At long last, her unrequited love is consummated. The reflected light in her closet acts as a projection of friction; the same light then fades away after Jong-su finishes. He saw, not the Virgin Mary's tears, but the miracle of love, ""a brief moment"", just like Shin-hae said, among her personal things. Like the mother in ""Secret Sunshine"", Jong-su will lose somebody he loves.Does God exist?That is not the question ""Burning"" asks.The audience susses out. The cat; was there ever a cat?""Boil,"" she calls, but no cat appears. Does this feline exist? Or do you just need faith in cat? The next time Lee Jong-su returns, this time as a cat-sitter, its litter box is full op poop. So is there really a cat, after all, or a secular miracle? The mystery goes unanswered on two fronts after Shin-hae goes missing. The landlady insists that no cat ever lived there. Also, the cat he rescues in a parking garage may answer to ""Boil"", but that could just be a coincidence, which people often confuse for a miracle. It's Ben's cat. Ben(Steven Yeun), her friend she met in Kenya, is a pyromaniac; he burns greenhouses. Did Shin-hae die in one of these greenhouses. Is Ben an eastern religion radical. ""The Parable of the Burning House"" tells the story about how a father saves his distracted children from self-immolate by luring them out with the promise of toys. Did Ben adapt the Buddhist fable to suit his needs? Instead of parent and child, what if the two parties are man and woman? He tells Jong-su his plans to burn a greenhouse in the near-future, somewhere close by. Jong-su goes on a wild goose chase. It's Shin-hae he should be seeking out. But the good friends, potential lovers, had a falling out. Jong-su disapproved of her night dancing, topless. ""Only w***** do that,"" he tells Shin-hae, which turns out to be a parting shot, as she drives away with Ben, her killer.Western, more so than eastern religions, teaches you to forgive your enemies. In ""Secret Sunshine"", Yeung-jin Jo(Doe-seop Park), the born-again schoolteacher who murders Shin-ae's son, forgives himself before the mother gets the chance to absolve him. Forgiveness is not a two-way street. Shin-ae goes off the rails. Conversely, Lee Jong-su shows no mercy towards Ben; first stabbing, and then choking Ben to death. Unliike the born-again schoolteacher, Ben readily accepts his punishment. The dying man looks back at Jong-su as if he agrees with his attacker's malefic vigilantism. Ben doesn't look for absolution.If there is a secret in the sunshine, Ben doesn't want to know about it.",Burning

This movie is like a puzzle that you will want to solve and will have fun trying to discover where's the place of each piece.But not everything is positive. Although I recognize that the first part is necessary for the characters construction and for the viewers became to know them I still think that the pace might be a little too slow sometimes and some scenes are too long for the content they have and for a lot of people it might become boring. Because of the that this ain't suitable for everyone and a lot of people won't have the patience and interpretation skills it requires.",Burning
89,mc1382,Ok look,6,23 June 2019,"Burning is a film I should really like more than I do. The cinematography is gorgeous, the thematic content is subversive and the atmosphere is suffocating. Where I feel this film falters is the characters and pacing. The film introduces Lee Jong-Su who is sometimes compelling, sometimes wasted. The film throws you into his world and doesn't really give you context for his situation. This inherently isn't a bad thing but the things they do show don't make me intrigued to find out more about him. There are certain aspects that are interesting about him but the film doesn't expand upon it enough. It's not until the second half where he gets interesting. Although this is more to do with the turn of events rather than the character himself. I wanna stress that he did have good moments but for the majority of the film, he came off as messily written. The other characters such as Shin Hae-mi and Ben had similar problems. Hae-mi seems like an interesting character on paper but she feels kinda hollow and empty. She has some fantastic moments but those are sparse.Early in the film when Jong-Su and Hae-mi meet in the apartment, an extended scene of intimacy is included which is fine and all but the film doesn't spend enough time with these characters to justify the long scene. The scene would've been way more cathartic if the film built up their relationship a bit more. This aspect of this relationship doesn't really come back later unless we count Ben into the equation. Ben is a conflicting character for me as he is the most enigmatic and interesting character in the film. The only thing is I wish the film made his character more engaging in the first half. He just comes off as this stereotypical rich boy who you don't really care for. In the second half, the film does a U-Turn on his character and this just came out of nowhere. That's my main issue here. A lot of what happens in the film feels like what the script wanted rather than an organic conflict coming from the characters. I hate to be one of those people but I really felt the pacing in this. The film is a slow burn but the film doesn't really justify this. It just feels slow for the sake of slow. 30-40 minutes could've been cut and it would've made the film much better.I wanna end this by saying that I did admire a lot about this film. Particularly the themes and symbolism (especially in the second half) but I just feel if the characters and pacing were stronger then we would have a phenomenal film here. As it is, it just comes off as a bit of a mess.",Burning

In any other case I can think of with this, I've been turned off to enjoying a film with so little answers, but considering this is more akin to Eyes Wide Shut, in that it's an experience to me where I struggle to find the words that justify my feelings on the film overall. It's such a struggle because the way Lee Chang-dong seems uninterested with satisfaction of the audience, telling a conventional narrative, or even telling it in a conventional way challenges the way I've watched films up until I first ""experienced"" this film. It's a modern film in the vein of Good Time where I've felt challenged by a filmmaker (in a different way, of course). But upon first watching it, I had no clue what to make of my experience and though after a second watch I do feel I have a better understanding of what my complete thoughts on the film are, I feel the words still elude me on how to precisely and deservedly explain the mastery that I believe is on display in Burning.",Burning

95,walter-08224,"""Burning"" MOST HAUNTING FILM EXPERIENCE OF 2018",10,17 January 2019,"The only flaw in Burning is the length, about 15-20 minutes could have been cut in the first half but i don't mind because i was never bored and interested the whole time. It is one of the most haunting & transfixing cinematic experiences i've seen from this decade. Lee has a fascinating ability to create a film with very complex themes while doing so with a minimal use of words. It masterfully transitions from a drama to a mystery that becomes all the more emotional as it proceeds, to the point it sort of sneaks up on you in terms of the significance of every minor word or statement of the few characters we see. It's a film that leaves you guessing after every scene, by the end of the film you will be chilled by just how sudden the climax is.One of the best things about Burning is Steven Yeun as Ben. He creates a mysterious character, something is off about him as his well-off, pompous, almost emotionless character leaves you guessing. One of his best scenes is when he mentions his odd hobby of greenhouse burning. It's amazing and i wont get into anymore for the sake of spoilers.The film is beautifully filmed, the scenes have a brilliant lighting and the time of day used in the scenes is so well timed.The Film is great, it is simply transfixing to watch the mystery unfold. The film is simple to follow but complex in nature. The performances of Yoo Ah-In & Steven Yeun are two of the best of 2018 and deserve the praise. The film won't be for everyone but it's one i recommend.",Burning

The script, based on a short story (that appeared in The New Yorker) by Haruki Murakami (equally boring), is beyond what I would call weak, and the only consolation when it was all said and done, for me, was that I didn't pay to see it!!!",Burning
98,Floki_Thorfinn,"A superb, unconventional thriller",9,27 March 2019,"My first Lee Chang-dong's, ""Burning"", felt as a Hanekesque with a Lynchesque ¿twist?/ending. This masterpiece provides more questions than answers, and that is why I loved it so much, that intrigue and growing mystery filmed in beautiful pace.Whether was all fantasy or not, we can't escape the great details in this film such as the cinematography, the script and the performances. My favorite part of the movie was Hae-mi's half naked dance in the sunset with jazz music in the background, it was just astonishing.In the end, I was left with my questions unanswered, but it's quite interesting, I think, that the director makes you think, and think hard; to idealize your own explanation, and therefore, to get to the conclusion that you think is the best.My own was that it's all just the novel Jong-su (if he is the writer writing about himself as mentioned in a part of the film) is writing. Near the end of the movie, he's briefly seen writing in a room that looks exactly as Hae-mi's, so that's what brought me to my belief.Of course this is just a plain explanation, there are quite more elements to observe in the plot such as the meaning of set the greenhouses on fire (a metaphor for human purge perhaps?), the trial of Jong-su's father, the cat, Hae-mi's disappearance, and so on; All of this I can only imagine it and play in my mind with it, but it's quite difficult to put it into words so I won't make this an all written thought conclusion but a simple one. Only a thing I can be more certain about is that Ben and Hae-mi were just fictional characters that he created for his novel, or... in the beginning it was all true, in a timeline of reality: since Jong-su meets Hae-mi until her arrival from Africa and a not-well-received Ben, and since he feels jealous, he begins to write the novel with those people and he as the main characters, as a way to free his mind and ultimately kill Ben, at least in a fictionalized way. I don't know, the possibilities are infinite (alike Vanilla Sky, if you will), that's why Burning is a superb film, because it makes you reason it and enjoy the film at the same time.Also, the score is awesome, particularly the music in the final credits.In my *Best Films of 2018 Top Ten List*, I place Burning in spot #3.",Burning
99,paulccarroll3,Writer waiting for inspiration.,6,17 August 2020,"I found this film interesting. A little slow, but that's what fast forward is for. My gripe on this film is that the main character, Jongsu, seldom answers a direct question, or statement from other characters. He just stands there staring, gape mouthed, while we the audience has to try to fathom His thoughts. Which, of course, is difficult to do, especially in a different language and culture. I feel that this isn't the actors fault, but instead is in the screenplay, or a decision of the director, trying to be mysterious. It's similar to the film ""Meet Joe Black"", where before every character says their lines, they have to pause, and consider. Which was also a decision of the director. In ""Burning"" it's never explained where Jongsu gets His money, what he's living off of. We're told that He's out of work, and poor, but He seems to have gasoline money, Can afford to stalk Ben, etc. I mean, how much can you get from selling a calf?

103,markmuhl,Disoriented,9,6 January 2021,"One of those movies that know to fascinate despite the fact that nothing much happens.

Halfway the girl disappears and eventually the director succeeded in also leaving me behind disoriented. If it was in the director's intention to put us film consumers into the shoes of the main protagonists then he has done a great job.The 'nothing much' works for various reasons.
* The movie has many interesting dialogues, some of them even a bit odd but definitely not off-the-shelf.
* The 3 main characters are really diverse (poor pickup boy versus rich Porsche boy) and it is quite interesting to watch them interact.
* Excellent acting performances and an artistic camera work
* Some great pieces of music, ranging from Jazz to almost off-keyThe movie is also good in laying out tracks to small mysteries, that kept me busy thinking about them.
* Does Haemi's cat really exist or is it only a pretend cat, that needs to be fed by Jongsu?
* Is Ben's cat a stray cat found or is it in fact Haemi's cat?
* Does mysterious Ben really burn down glass houses just for fun?Especially the last question keeps floating over the 2nd half of the movie. When does the burning eventually happen and what does this thought do to Jongsu?On top, there is this ongoing North Korean propaganda voice, which can be heard from Jongsu's farm. Truly bizarre. Altogether quite a mysterious movie about life being a mystery.",Burning
104,TheJohnnyPHreak,Slow Burn Drama With A Lot To Think About,7,19 June 2019,"When I heard about people raving about a film, it piques my interest. I have an innate sense in me to see every movie I can. I try not to be that picky. There are plenty of genres that I'm not a huge fan of but I'll see a movie in that genre if I see something about the film that attracts me to it. A lot of times going in cold to a film is the best. I can enjoy the film with no bias and just look at the film for what it is. Sometimes (not all the time) preconceived notions spoil or ruin a film for anyone. But just hearing people rave about a film will definitely help lean me to the side that says ""you must see this movie"". When I found out Burning from director Chang-dong Lee, I only knew it was a film that takes a turn and it's something you won't see coming. Everyone was right about that, where this film goes is somewhere I can't even fathom.Ah-in Yoo stars as Lee Jong-su, a writer from a small town who happens to bump into a childhood friend Shin Hae-mi (Jong-seo Jun) on his way home. They reconnect and she asks him to take care of her cat while she takes a trip to Africa. She comes back with a mysterious man Ben (Steven Yeun) who is very friendly, rich and has a very secret hobby. The less anyone knows about this film the better. Because when it turns, it goes full turn there's not slight about it. It goes down some dark paths and some interesting alleyways in life. The film has something to say and it might not all be clear. There is definitely a comment on the classes in society that can't be missed.Chang-dong Lee along with cinematographer Kyung-pyo Hong paints a beautiful moving painting that is part drama, part mystery and totally engaging. After I would say the first 25 minutes the film takes off and doesn't stop. It is a slow burn but where it gets to where it's going, it's well worth the trip. Ah-in Yoo is good as this writer who doesn't know what to write but he has an idea. He's almost fresh out of school with no job but ideas swirling in his head. I relate so much as I was him when I got out of school. I had dreams of grandeur as a writer. So many ideas in my head that I couldn't get all down. I did struggle with writer's block as well. I needed inspiration and to get that inspiration you sometimes have to face things you aren't ready to face.Jong-seo Jun plays the feel spirited female character so well. She's got more going on than she admits and she pushes that on-screen without saying it. It's a deep performance that when she's not on screen we miss her. I got all the feels from her performance and was constantly engaged with her character. You can see why she would attract all kinds of suitors. I really hope she uses this role to gain more powerful roles because she has some serious chops. Having only seen Steven Yeun once outside of The Walking Dead (Sorry To Bother You) I didn't know what to expect but he knocks his role out of the park. Genuinely smart, mysterious and a bit creepy I felt uneasy when his character is on screen, especially interacting with Jun and Lee. Near the end of the film when all the pieces are put together you can see how good he was at the character moments. I can only see him getting a lot more work after this because he's doing something here that's so layered it's scary.The film is beautifully shot. It feels like a set of painting all with this blue tint to them. There are some excellent long takes and scenery. In the middle of the film, there is a scene with the three leads that is used for the poster above, this scene is haunting but engrossing. Jong-seo Jun does this dance to the backdrop of an empty field at sunset. I can't express how cool and chill it is. It also leads us to the viewers to think that all is well. We get a false sense of security and when the rug is pulled from under us the hit is hard.Burning is a film I was happy to discover. This psychological drama mystery has so much going on. It leaves the audience asking so many questions after the last frame goes to black. And that's not a bad thing at all. I also hate when the term slow burn is used in a negative way. This film is a slow burn to start but once it gets going it flies through it's run time. Ah-in Yoo, Steven Yeun, Jong-seo Jun are all fantastic, with Yeun giving a breakout performance. Chang-dong Lee is a director I will be keeping my eye on because of this excellent example of letting the full story play out with great characters in pretty scenes. I can only say that being a huge fan of David Fincher this felt very much like one of his film and I love that.",Burning
105,berndgeiling,In Trance,5,9 June 2019,"For me watching this movie was both challenging and boring throughout the whole duration, in the first 90 min. i even had to fight against falling asleep, which in my opinion was caused by the movie itself and not by my own mental or physical condition. I couldn't find a key to get access to this movie and decided to give it a low rating.
On day after this strange experience i find myself still thinking about the movie, a process of reflection which i seem to share with a lot of people. This is always a sign that a movie isn't that bad at all after first sight.
Today i found the key to open myself up to the truly uncompromising artificial universe of this movie. I listened to it's soundtrack, from Mowg.
It puts you immediately into a trance-like, hypnotic state of mind, where everything might possible, thoughts and emotions come and go, wandering right through you. It's not, what you might think at first, something based on reality. I even think the characters i have seen on the screen aren't real. They might have come out of the main characters writer's mind itself, and there is one scene giving a clear hint on this speculation. I don't know if this serves as a solution for the enigma the movie raises in front of your eyes, as long as you're able to keep your eyes open and don't fall into a trance-like state while watching it.
I rated 2 yesterday, and changed it for a 5 today.
If that's not a recommendation it's at least an appeal to make up your own mind about this film. Never condemn what you don't understand!",Burning
106,sadako11,"Intriging, well acted but meh... I found a couple of interesting details if you care to know..",6,16 February 2019,"1. The main character Jong-su appears in 99.9% off all scenes in the movie except one! He is nowhere to be found in the scene where Ben (Steven Yun) is in his apartment's bathroom getting the makeup box and applying lipstick to her girlfriend. This scene is sandwiched between the scene where Jong-su is writing (his novel?) at Hae-mi 's apartment and the murder ending scene.
So you can guess that he just created the lipstick and murder scene for his novel.2. I don't know if this is related to the plot of the movie but the actor that plays Hae-mi had (quite bad if you ask me) breast implants after coming back from Africa. If you compare her physique during her sunset topless dance with her love scene with Jong-su at the beginning of the film her physique is not the same. She was already very pretty, why would she do that?Anyway, I love slow burning movies and I enjoyed this one.Kudos for the director for keeping me intrigued for more than two hours.
I love paying attention to details to solve a mystery or discovering something puzzling but for some reason this movie doesn't give me enough to give it higher marks.I think I understood all the topics, subtopics and metaphors the movie wanted to transmit but at the end my feeling was meh...I think the main issues were that the movie is overlong and the character Jong-su.
This character is soooo damn dull! Some reviewers found him interesting with multiple layers in his personality. Me, I did not find anything interesting about him. He spends 15+ min running around the fields and following Ben!

114,AIOS-Reviews,No. It's not just a thriller. I repeat. No,9,16 January 2019,"There are people I heard saying that this film's first half is really boring, it should be cut half. But actually when you watch this as a thriller you may feel like this. It's not something what it looks. Its more about something else. I am briefly describing that under.Lee Jong-su (Ah In Yoo) is a guy whose story is quiet complicated. At the beginning of the story he meets with Shin Hae-mi (Jong-seo Jeon) at a lottery center. Hae-mi is a girl who considered her self as the old neighbor of him. Slowly we discovers that Jong-su is an introvert, who fallen in love with Hae-mi after having sex. One day Hae-mi left for a tour to Africa and met a guy named Ben on the tour, who seems suspicious to Jong-su. These three charecters are the main in this story. There story unfolds and we starts realizing so many things.Burning left us with an unanswered question that on can realize after a while if he or she wants to know. Burning is not just a thriller, It's something more about the introversion life of Jong-su, about love and about to believe. And above all it's about life.Now, how can it be like that. The whole film is made on the point of view of Jong-su, one introvert will surely discover what's running over his mind all the time. As we see Jong-su's life is quiet complicated, he has no strong connection with his family and he doesn't even has any good friend, Now that makes a man depressed. The first half is all about to show to dicover the ending. why Jong-su is like that, and why does he killed. How can someone simple like him can turn a killer. Jong-su fallen in love with Hae-mi and he realized that there are still hope for him to live a happy life, so then Hae-mi is the only one who is there for him, but still that only power of Jong-su has been borrowed by someone, At the end we get confused and thinks that the film will show us that why and how. But as i described it's completely on the point of view of Jong-su so he had to kill Ben. Because the proves were all in front of him. He always used to keep the fire inside him that finally shows it's range. Jong-su has lost everything, and he has the culprit in front of him, he has nothing to lose. Again the story is about to believe. Why? because If the believe over Hai-mi would not come Jong-su could never go to the end of his life, that end where he can find himself, as the ignored mute guy trying to do something big but always ending up failing.The more you think about Burning the more you discovers. It's one of the most amazing film in recent times. The film reminds me of Manchester by The Sea, it was also some kind of film that has so many tells inside it's.A life changing cinematography that stays with you along all the day after watching.

116,screenotes,"disquiet, disquiet, disquiet...BANG!",10,23 August 2019,"On the face of it, Burning may be a hard sell. A two and a half hour slow burning mystery which leaves more loose ends than it ties up is not going to be everybody's jar of kimchi. Adapted from a Haruki Murakami short story called Barn Burning the film follows seeming loner and aspiring young novelist Jong-su (Ah-in Yoo) and the disappearance of the object of his affections Hae-Mi (Jong-seo Jun) who initially returns from a trip abroad with her new friend 'Ben' (Steven Yeun). The more Jong-Su learns about the mysterious, suave and sophisticated Ben, the more suspicious Hae-mi's disappearance seems.Make no mistake, there is a definite end to the narrative. Yet part of the charm of this film is that several different interpretations of the narrative work coherently and concurrently.Burning is one of those films which made me question everything I'd just seen. It made me want to immediately watch it again with the knowledge I'd gained by the end to see how my perception of the preceeding events had been altered. This aspect is not unlike many films I've seen (and reviewed) over the last 12 months. Films such as Cure (1997), Stay (2005) and Hold the Dark (2018) all contained a narrative ambiguity with endings impactful enough for me to at least spend time mulling over everything I'd just seen.Yet the genius of Burning (2018) is that there is nothing ambiguous about its narrative at all. More to the point, everything we see is from the point of view of a single character and there is no sense that anything has been redacted from this point of view. All our protagonist's actions make complete sense from beginning to end based on his (and indeed our) experience and yet looking back, it is as easy to read him as a jealous and jilted Sociopath as it is to read him as a justified avenging hero.All of this is achieved without the short cut of expositional dialogue or internal monologue as Director Chang-dong Lee allows the cinematography to do most of the 'talking'. It's true that this method contributes to the two and a half hour runtime, which is perhaps the only negative I can offer and also a factor which will limit its audience regardless of how highly it is praised. This is not to say there isn't any dialogue but the interactions seem to be at once believable, metaphorical and opaque, serving more as a means to further isolate our everyman hero (or villain) than to fill in any gaps in the audience's understanding of the narrative.It's isolation which pervades the screen in Burning. It wasn't long after the film's conclusion that I began to draw parallels with Taxi Driver (1976). While Scorcese's classic doesn't quite end on its climax in the way that Chang-dong Lee's does, the structure of 'disquiet, disquiet, disquiet...BANG!' is eerily present in both as well as a desperate isolation. Yet while DeNiro's Travis Bickle noticeably unravels before our eyes, Lee Jong-su's social awkwardness surfaces only through his inability to ask direct and seemingly obvious questions of the characters around him. This is not a frustration I found as a viewer as much as a realistic portrayal of how the majority of people interact in real life, serving to further Jong-su's everyman credentials. It is also quite telling that Hae-mi feels isolated to the point that she expresses a desire to simply disappear.Speaking of the film ending on its climax, the climax itself is as shocking as it is congruous with everything that's come before it. It's evidence of the tightrope the narrative has been walking for its entire runtime and is the key to the alternative perspective(s) on everything that's come before. The final scene is also mirrors many of the visual metaphors and motifs throughout the film which is a delight to anyone who's been paying attention to remember any and all seemingly throwaway shots or remarks. I haven't yet watched Burning a second time all the way through however I gleefully patted myself on the back noticing the following:Rather than seeing the car explode into flames, we see initially only a refraction of the light from the frames in the Van / on Jong Su's face as he is driving away, echoing the sunlight which comes in only at a certain time and for a short while into Hae-mi's tiny apartment.Jong-su's own history of burning things is referenced through dialogue (his father made him burn his mother's clothes after she left) and visually, as he not only seemingly absent-mindedly starts and then stops burning a barn he is inspecting. One of the few flashbacks or dream sequences (the film doesn't tell us which) is of what must be Jong-su standing in front of a burning barn. This may indicate Ben is a figment of Jong-su's imagination. Whatever the case, references in dialogue to The Great Gatsby are certainly a clue that we may have an 'unreliable narrator' on our hands.The fact that Jong-su removes all of his clothes (ostensibly to burn the evidence of his connection to the crime scene) echoes his admonishment of Hae-mi for exposing her breasts when in the shared company of Ben. It also references the conversation Jong-su has with Hae-mi's coworker in which she emphasises the plight of women who are criticised for wearing clothes which are ""too revealing"" as well as being criticised for ""dressing down"". This seems to indicate that Jong-su will be even further isolated after his final violent act.A feminist take on toxic masculinity? The world as seen through the eyes of a Sociopath? Or just a straight-forward revenge thriller? The film seems to offer so many levels of interpretation and yet works from a narrative perspective on all of them. These are just some of the reasons that Burning is instantly one of my all time favourite films.",Burning

125,mkurtsen,Burning,10,3 April 2020,"Burning (Suphe) is one of them. The subject of the movie is adaptation from thehort story of Japanese writer Haruki Murakami. After a little research, you realize that he adapted the room's fan named William Faulkner, one of his favorite writers, with the same title in 1939. A lot of mention of William Faulkner in the movie, the protagonist's desire to be a writer, Faulkner readings. Evidence that they do nothing secret.
Barn Burning is a very plain and 10-page short story that has not been translated. Murakami is a writer I have not read the spirit of his books; I do not know, but many elements such as cats, wells, sexuality, system criticism, natural beauties and distorted urbanization problems, adolescence and family conflicts are used in small details successfully by making use of the visual quality of the cinema.
In the 148-minute movie, the audience focuses on the movie from the first minute to the 148th minute, and does not lose its Concentration for a minute.
The two actors Ah-in Yoo and Steven Yeun, who played the leading role in the film, are young but experienced actors. The first film and first experience of the actress Jong-seo Jun. But no disruption, the game is excellent. Let's say this is the success of the director.
The expectations about the movie are high. Korea's Best Foreign Language Film 2019 Academy Award (Oscar) nominee.olark has been announced. Director Lee Chang-dong was awarded the FIPRESCI award for his movie ""Burning"" at the Cannes Film Festival in 2018.

Two former schoolmates from the poor countryside who are struggling to make it in the difficult, competitive maze of urban Korea run into each other by chance. One is a struggling, aspiring writer with no pretenses who may be a semi-autobiographical character for the filmmaker, the other an attractive, free-spirited but lonely and emotionally vulnerable young woman with a talent for dancing. She recognizes him in the midst of her profound loneliness, feels a mixture of attraction and desperation and spontaneity, and gets him into bed. He, just as lonely, in the midst of numbing familial emotional and legal problems, gets entirely too attached. From there, the enigmatic nightmare begins. She goes off to Africa for a short time and asks the poor farmer/writer to watch her cat in the city. A cat which may or may not exist. When she returns from Kenya, she introduces a Korean friend she met there under extreme circumstances, a friend she may or may not be sleeping with. This friend may or may not be a psychopath, a mysterious Gatsby who lives a wealthy life without seemingly working, who may or may not indulge in a disturbing hobby (or two, or three). Outwardly he's charming but constantly bored, a mixture of shallow and deep, and as pretentious as the young farmer-writer isn't. The writer loves Faulkner because he sees himself in the pages; the strange Korean Gatsby reads Faulkner out of surface ""interest,"" and possibly to impress a woman. He is ""interested,"" he says, in people like the writer and the lonely girl, he is ""interested"" in their lives, their plight, but interest is far from compassion or understanding, of course. The writer thinks he sees through him.But all of that summarization is only half the story here, if that. The whole film takes on a hazy magical-realist style that exudes the translucent atmosphere of author Haruki Murakami, who wrote the story this is loosely based on. Truth and imagination become constantly blurred in this tumultuous emotional forest, and the second half of the movie feels like a dreamy, almost surreal take on a Hitchcock mystery. I've watched this movie three times and come to different conclusions after each viewing. It's one of those great works of art where the observer's interpretation depends as much on them as the work they're observing. All I know for sure is that after three views, this is one of my favorite movies of all time, something I never say lightly.

135,Vinicius8,"""That's been so cold, look at my face, all the stories it will tell I can't erase""",7,11 March 2019,"Ironically, ""Burning"" is... Cold. It's a cold depiction of a set of events. It could - and should - have been more emotional, more impactful. It should've pulled on some heartstrings, but it didn't. ""Burning"" is a slow-burner (yeah, again with the pun. I know it ain't even funny, but it's true, so don't judge me ...) and that in itself isn't a problem because it does use its time meaningfully. However, it's not meaningful in the way it should have been to make the way things played out worth your while. The movie starts off much like a simple drama, but delves into a picturesque character study sort of film. Still using the same methods of direction, the movie then morphs into a mystery-thriller. (The mystery happens because, as character study, the film simply shows us hints of what is on the mind of the character, but with too many hints it allows anything to be interpreted; therefore, creating mystery). The looking-from-afar style makes it impossible to connect emotionally when the thriller is at its full-blown sequence, especially when the motives for said tension to escalate were disregarded to begin with. It's actually more confusing than infuriating. When you realise: ""Oh, so that happened..."" you're left more than a little underwhelmed.""Beoning"" is beautifully shot and perfectly written. There's nothing I would change about that, neither would I'd want the acting to be any different. I just question the directors choices, as it could've allowed a emotionally devastating masterpiece to exist.About all the social-economic-gender-politics nonsense some people see in this movie, I can't say for sure that it wasn't Chang-Dong Lee's exact thoughts on this whole movie. However, you'll see that exactly what I said earlier about the construction the plot being too impersonal is what allowed these people to see whatever they wanted in the cold-hard presented in the movie. Sure, Lee Jong-su's narrative can't be trusted. Sure, I considered it all to be a figment of his imagination. But let's be realistic here for a moment: how many movies have already done that kind of plot twist? It's, honestly, quite idiotic. It would have too many plot-holes. Sometimes simple is best, and otherwise wouldn't work anyways, so why consider all the other possibilities? The movie is what it is. Simple and straightforward. Whatever else you see there is just you doing what you thought the protagonist was doing; it's you projecting your own fantasies and beliefs into this movie. But then again, I don't know what Chang-Dong Lee was thinking when he made this movie. It could be that the ambiguity is there to have this exact kind of impact.Nonetheless, I believe movies shouldn't be political statements. A film should be an art form, and art should be felt. Doesn't stop it from having social commentary of some sort, however ""Beoning"" failed to make me feel just about anything, so, despite having a cast of enormous talent and having hit all the right marks on the technical aspects, it failed to do what matters most; it failed to carry emotions with it.",Burning

The thing about the author, Haruki Murakami, he is a master writer. A true writer in the same vein as Faulkner, or Ford, but if you are without that big hole inside you searching for the deep currents in life, then this movie, like his novels will seem simple, and uneventful.
There is nothing in this his novels that is without purpose, and even his seemingly messiness to the structure of his novels is with purpose, driving towards those deeper ideas of what it means to be human, all the weird and lonely ways we exist as humans.
If football and 6-packs are enough for you, this is not your movie.
If you have deep moments of pause, reflection, or emotions so deep you cannot understand where they well up from, or you have ever felt deep yearning past all understanding of it's source, then this movie will talk to you.
Anyone who criticizes the writer it totally oblivious, it is like you are giving writing advice to William Faulkner or Ernest Hemingway. He is so widely read, in all languages, won so many literary accolades, as his words transcend language, so if his writing is not for you that is 100% cool. He isn't for everyone, just like William Faulkner, Ford, or Tolstoy is not for everyone, but at least educate yourself on who you are talking about before you dive into critiquing his works.

I'm so hooked on this country's films lately. This film's main character Jong-su is a strange, quiet, perpetually stoned-looking but surprisingly intelligent young man who has an encounter with a free-spirited but also strange young woman, after which she leaves to explore Africa leaving him to pine and obsess... when she comes back with a new man, where will his feelings for her take him? By the way I can relate to this kid and this situation on so many levels... maybe it helped in my enjoyment of the film but I found his character and the actor's portrayal to be absolutely brilliant... it's such a strange way to play a character that is already quite strange, at least some people would say so. But who is anybody to judge? Every time Jong-su opens his mouth you realize he's a genius because everything he says is incredible. He just knows when to shut up and listen when Hae-mi is saying something, and I can really respect that. He doesn't show a lot of emotion for most of the film, at least not obvious ones. He's extremely reserved but it's not a flaw for him, he makes it a strength. His performance is incredibly subtle. He appears weak and passive especially to the alpha male Ben who is played to PERFECTION by Stephen Yuen. He is a terrifying character. Absolutely chilling. Also with some depth and layers of his own to ponder... But mostly he's a classic sociopath and I think Jong-su recognizes this pretty quickly. I also think Jong-su recognizes the possibility that Hae-mi and him might not end up together. Maybe his seeming obsession isn't quite what it seems... I feel like his anger at her that came out as rage for taking her clothes off was actually concern for her well-being with Ben. He never does anything obsessive towards her in the film, he simply always does what's best for her. And he knows that Ben is not a good person from every cocky mannerism and the lack of emotion and empathy that he shows constantly. Jung-su is willing to accept that him and Hae-mi may not be destined to be anything more than a hookup, but he's not willing to accept her ending up with Ben. He sees her free spirit and wants to let it fly free... I also feel like Hae-mi is definitely bipolar, and that the filmmakers present her personality and psychology with respect and beauty... she often dances in a possibly manic way and then goes into a depressive state in some incredibly moving sequences. Her truth is hard to pin down and that's what makes her so alluring. But Ben sees her as weak prey and Jung-su sees her as strong and unique but can't help but feel protective of her. What a crazy love triangle of a bipolar, a sociopath and what I can only guess is a person with borderline personality disorder. No judgements though. I've struggled with it myself. I see so much of myself in this character...I have to talk about the cinematography in this film. The sumptuous long tracking shots of which there must be ten or more in this film, and one in particular was maybe one of the most gorgeous things I've ever seen. The incredible sunsets over the Demilitarized Zone. The lighting captured in some of these shots actually made my jaw drop. Incredible work was put into the visual look of this film and I really appreciate this.The ending. I was rooting for him to do that for so long. But when he did it I started second guessing myself. Did what he thinks happened actually happen? Was it really the well or was it Africa again? Was the ending truly deserved? What would you have done? I might have done the same thing... but that cat... he was the one who lost it in the first place, so maybe Ben actually told the truth about it... so many circumstantial elements to ponder. Nothing in the film is obvious. Everything is a subtlety within an enigma. One thing but another. It's so graceful in it's depiction of Jung-su's gracelessness. Also the jealousy of the grace of Hae-mi that he manages to contain while Ben maybe doesn't. He even said the jealousy was his... I can't stop thinking about so many scenes that linger in the mind like silent fires fading into the distance. And the whole thing is a dark and enchanting tapestry. I love this film. Watch it right now.",Burning

-The abandoned greenhouses are obviously metaphors for women who are alone and in debt. Ben preys on these women because no one would miss them, just like no one would miss an abandoned greenhouse.-Haemi didn't fall into a well. If she did, one of the three older women would have remembered it. The well is a metaphor for her life. She's alone and can't crawl herself out of her debt. Jangsu shows up and saves her by brightening her life.-Ben is obviously a psycopath. One of the ways you can see that is that he yawns when other people are laughing.-A really important detail is that ""cremation"" and ""makeup"" are spelled the same way in Korean.

146,cornerofspace,The slowest burn I've witnessed recently.,7,21 March 2021,"'Burning' was a title that came to my attention as I looked for mystery films. Unfortunately, most mystery films have spoiler-tastic trailers that shows you the entire plot. Being a man who loves trailers, I had to take the risk. And... the trailer of 'Burning' tells you very little, to my surprise. You're shown a bunch of clips and you're not sure which information is vital to the story. Added with the trailer is a slow, but progressive beat of sounds that tells you something is amiss. With cryptic dialogue and metaphors, you know you're in for a treat if you choose to watch this film.And as I watched the film, I noticed immediately just how slow the pacing is. The scenes are sometimes so slow, you feel that the main character must also thinks and acts very slowly. It was only after I finished the film did I realize this story was based on a short written by Haruki Murakami. I have not read any of his works, but I know Murakami often writes stories filled with melancholy and surrealism.And boy was this film filled with them. By the half way point, you recognize that the main character lives a very solitary life devoid of meaning. Yet, meaning surrounds him with the conversation he has and the things he has to do such as taking care of a calf and his father's home.As we try to piece together what is going on, a mystery develops organically that begs the main character to solve. But what is brilliant about this film, and perhaps its greatest flaw, is that there are no exposition in this entire movie. Characters never explain their thought process, and cryptic metaphors and dreams are littered throughout the film.You are responsible in determining what truly happened. You are responsible in finding meaning in this story, if any. And I think as a whole, many of us will be able to find some sort of meaningful commentary related to society, or adulthood, or what it means to live.Perhaps this is what Mr. Murakami wanted. A story that isn't about finding the truth, but finding meaning behind the imagery. Whatever conclusion you end up drawing, I encourage you to explore some analysis that has been made about the film. It is very interesting to see what others thought about the film.And I encourage you to come to a conclusion as well after watching the film. What really happened? What message is the writer trying to convey?For me, the pacing and overall aesthetic turned me off. However, your mileage will vary depending on your mood and thought processes.",Burning

149,mb-cunningham,A modest theory,9,18 May 2019,"To the Moderators: I tried to submit this review last night but my computer kept shutting down to update. I hope it was not submitted. Okay, take 3
I enjoy foreign movies, and prefer to have a subtitled copy of a film than a dubbed version. I was happy to see the subtitled version of Burning, even though it was a long film. By the end of the film, I wondered what I missed, and became instantly schooled by the reviews, particularly the reviews that broke down all the plot points, story arcs and political themes. It then dawned on me that Burning is a film that can be viewed by countless people, and everyone will look at it differently. Is that not a form of genius on Chang-dong Lee's part ?
My theory has not been mentioned in the reviews that I read, but forgive me for not reading all 124 reviews. Does anyone think that perhaps Hae-mi was not murdered? I mean, it is a possibility, no? What I have here might be paper thin to some, but here goes...
I think Hae-mi fits the ""manic pixie dream girl"" trope, but that is neither here nor there. The girl was a possible/probable liar (again, depending on how the individual views her character). All the the well stories did not add up. She could travel pretty easily, as shown by her (impulsive?) flight to Africa, which in turn tells us that her desire was to ""disappear into the sunset."". The cat jumping into Jong-su's arms could have been completely coincidental. Now, the really big clue, for me was the watch, but Jong-su admitted that he won it in a drawing at a fair after he was told it was cheap by Hae-mi. I wonder if it held any significance to him, because he just gave it to her. I kinda got the feeling that this watch was not carefully examined by Jong-su, so the one he finds in Ben's drawer might not have been the same watch he gave to Hae-mi. Okay, the previous statement is stretching things, but let's say it was the watch. This is where I credit (of all things) Psy and Gangham Style video for explaining the social mentality of being poor in this particular part of Korea. I think everyone could agree that Ben's character was that of a rich playboy, and would be considered a good catch to young women, especially women that might want to capitalize on his wealth and social status. I am an American, but here, if a gal returns to your place for even a one night stand, and she wants to see you again, she might leave an article of clothing or jewelry. It is kind of a cute way of using the item as a pretext to see you again. Ben had a lot of trinkets in that drawer. Did he murder the owners of them all?
My point (finally!) is that Hae-mi could have just packed her bug out bag and got outta Dodge. In her mind, she had no attachments and no need to tell either man about where she went or why. To me, a sign of a great film is if the viewers could converse about the film for longer than the run time of said film. I was ready to go full neanderthal with a rage filled review saying it was a complete waste of time, too long, and nothing happens. I am so glad I read the reviews, because the revelations were myriad and I would have missed the point completely. I would welcome the opportunity to discuss this film with another audience member.
I will put on another pot of coffee, because the conversation will last way longer than the film's run time.",Burning

But this story in 2018 is pure boredom, unless you are completely in love with this particular actor playing a limp dummy, or perhaps with the decorations, that are beautifully shot, I must say.

158,klown013,Terrible in every way,1,6 May 2019,"Some of the worst ""acting"" and pacing I have ever seen. The main actor (and I use the term actor very loosely) spends the whole movie staring off into space with his mouth hanging open. I genuinely do not know if he is supposed to be portraying a mentally challenged person or it just comes off that way. The lead actress spends all her time in the movie falling asleep in restaurants. I don't know if this is a common thing in Korea, but it happened 3 times in the first hour. I wanted to like something - anything - about this movie but it was an astounding waste of time and poorly made in every way.
All I can think about the positive reviews on here is that people who enjoyed this movie are the same type of people that look at a totally blank canvass and spend hours talking about how amazing ""the art"" is because they don't understand or like it, they just want to be hip.

159,Coolaj56,Artistic Symbolism at its Worst,2,11 March 2019,"Burning is like a puzzle being built in slow motion, except the puzzle never gets completed, half the pieces laid out don't contribute to it at all, the picture attempting to be built isn't particularly interesting, and the whole things takes an incredibly long time.
The main character Lee Jong-Su was underwhelming in writing and acting. He is ineffectual and uninteresting for the entire runtime. He also has no discernible chemistry with his love-interest Hae-Mi, despite what the dialogue occasionally suggests. The film just slowly meanders as it tries to establish some ideas. Some pieces here are actually interesting, but most of them just have no payoff. In that vein, this movie is apparently supposed to be a thriller that builds to a giant reveal at the end. A large portion of the film is going for symbolism that is for the most part silly and pretentious, and occasionally outright stupid. While I don't think anything I say could ruin someone's enjoyment of this film, because it does such a good job at ruining itself, I will still avoid spoilers. But suffice to say, the 'big reveal' is more stupid symbolism that makes no sense in the context of the plot.
From the structure, to the writing, the acting, the pacing, this film fails in essentially every category. The cinematography was reasonably good, but it was undermined by shots that lasted far far too long and an excessive focus on background nature over the characters in the story. This film probably deserves a 1/10 instead of a 2/10, but there were some scenes with Hae-Mi in the beginning that were actually decent.
I can't in good conscious recommend this to anybody, but it does have quite a bit in common with Roma, so if you like Roma than I suppose you might like this as well.",Burning

162,knhu,Interesting divergence from the original story,7,16 June 2019,"I love the original story that this movie is based on. The original short story is very lean, very compact, while laying out a world rich with suggestions, potentials and possibilities. The potentials and the possibilities are both there and not there. This magical realm of existence is what Haruki Murakami does best.In building a film from an extremely short story, this movie has added more layers to it. There's now more complexity, more details, more side issues. Particularly the many social issues that have been brought in, these issues completely change the essence of the story: this was originally a story of human nature, it is now a story of class warfare...As a result, this story has left that magical realm. In this new story, choices have been made, and the potentials and the possibilities have been killed off. I am fascinated by this uniquely Korean expression of it, but I also mourn the loss of the magic in the original story that is more universal to all of us.Also, as soon as you start adding more details, a story becomes messier, and you have to be extra careful that all details are coherent and consistent with each other. I find myself questioning some details as I was watching the film.Acting-wise, I find the acting from all of the actors a bit unnatural (overly dramatic).

To those who ask ""what am I missing here?"" - You're missing an appreciation of actual cinema, that's what you're missing. If you want an M. Knight Shymalan type reveal, this one doesn't deliver. Just state up front that you love action and violence or slapstick fart-comedy, and we'll understand. Then give this one a rating above 6 as a show of respect and move on. You are not helping anyone by giving this film an artificially low score.With that out of the way, ""Burning"" is a very well done loose adaptation of a short story by Haruki Murakami. He tends to have fire, cat and well themes in his books and short works, and this movie is true to that form. Best taken as a metaphor for the sense of helplessness felt by today's young adults in the 'modern' world and global economy, ""Burning"" unravels slowly for the viewer, with a non-intrusive but very well done soundtrack and amazing cinematography. In fact there are many metaphorical devices used in the film which makes it fun to keep an eye out for the little details that are shown, but not in such a way that you immediately realize their symbolism. It did not feel like a 2 hour and 10 minute movie to me as there was indeed very good pacing and a mysterious plot that takes a while to play out.Just a very competently told story and a bit of a 'thought piece' - as mentioned earlier there isn't really a lot of Hollywood sizzle and it doesn't play to any typical Western filmgoer's expectations.

What Burning and these two authors have in common is that their themes are often left unanswered and are left to ingrain themselves into your thoughts like an unwanted hermit.The themes I could pick out from my experience were about class struggle, burden of proof, sexism, lonliness, and jealousy, but I'm sure there is more to find with repeated viewings because after finishing the film, I left feeling so conflicted about who was right or wrong and whether anything I saw could be called true. To avoid spoilers I'll stop here at theming but just prepare to get flooded with persistant questions from characters that are meant to be poignant about society as we know it.Another stand out factor was the cinematography. Like Secret Sunshine, the film looks and sounds like a HongSang Soo film if HongSang Soo actually invested in camera operators and professional grade cameras (still love him though). The settings are very modest and the people dress and look very plain, but at the same time the lighting is incredibly dynamic and some shots are so intense with color that it might make some people tear up. The cinematography is literally ""low key"" amazing. 1 shot I want to commend is towards the beginning of the film, the camera is on the bus focused on the main actress who is waiting outside at the bus stop. The camera keeps her in center while the bus turns 270 degrees-ish to line up with the bus stop, and that level of coordination was jaw dropping to me yet the film makes no attempts to highlight this shot from the rest.I've only seen one other Lee Chang Dong film and that was Secret Sunshine, and I came out feeling the same way about that film as I did Burning, so I think people who enjoyed Secret Sunshine will enjoy this film as well, but at the same time I think people who didn't enjoy Secret Sunshine might struggle through this as well since Lee Chang Dong seemingly wants you to leave his films feeling bitter.",Burning

Also I love new Asian Cinema, I think IT is where is at. But there is a difference between a slow burner and a boring film. One has an interesting story, with good performances that just happens to move slowly, the other one has none of those qualities, that is the case here . Ad to that a length of 2 hours and 30 min, and you will find yourself hitting the pause button frequently wondering when this torture will end only to find out that you still have a long ways to go.
First of all, there are no interesting characters in this movie, the main character walks around expressionless like an underwater zombie for 2h20 min of the 2h30m, his life story not interesting at all. Walter Matthau was asked once if there was a character that he would not play, he responded ""A boring one. They asked me to play a boring guy and I said no"". Ah-In Yoo should have listened to that precious piece of advice. Steven Yeun plays a complete different character from his role as Glenn in the Walking Dead, that was a switch, but it did not require much, but given the main character's shortcomings you are ready to watch anyone else. And then there is the story, Boy meets quirky girl. Boy gets confused about girl having a 2nd relationship. Boy finds out things are not quite right. Problem is there is nothing interesting happening between those 3 story pillars, like NOTHING. And it is a shame because the set up is there to turn this piece of coal into a diamond but, nah, we get long shots of dancing, mountains, dark homes etc etc. After being vested into this thing for 90 min it took all my will to hang on for the ending, hoping upon hope that at least all the pent up 'mystery' was going to pay off with at least 10 closing min of good cinema, how disappointed I was when not even that was granted.

I don't even have to go back a long way, just last year my top two films were lengthy af. So I try as always to find a reasoning for that after I finish a movie. After finishing Burning, I could't but draw a couple comparisons with films that I love.First, it's another Korean film Memories of Murder. The last I could think of that had similar structure. What I mean by that?. Well, there's a genre switch after a good hour plus into both films. Usually I don't mind that at all, hence I loved Memories of Murder. In the same time I wonder if all this hour spend before the switch was well worthed/paid off in some way or form later in the film. In Burning, after the finale, I realised that it could benefit itself, if some earlier parts were cut out.Second, it's Blade Runner 2047. Yes, they're both pretty legthy and also well directed. But in BR2047, the moments were the film paced itself down, were filled with some mesmerizing sceney. And I know when comparing
the two I'm not doing Burning any favors. Don't get me wrong there are beautiful sequences (accompanied with exquisite music) but they're few and far between for me.The ending of the film leaves you a bit disconnected from the characters, worried and troubled when the message of the film hits you. I loved that. It leaves things unclear and ambiguous. In hindsight, there was no need for an HOUR plus of just characters talking to each other, since the ending implies that the characters were nothing like you thought them to be.",Burning

The film isn't for a wide audience, lasts 2 and a half hours, it goes slowly and asks a lot of questions. But the plot is built correctly, so that the viewer can understand the characters and start thinking about the questions that have arisen.
The independent film seems to be divided into 2 parts: the first tells the story of a love triangle, and the second goes to a fascinating detective thriller. Director Lee Chang-dong wonderfully plays with the viewers' imagination who are trying to understand the thoughts of the main characters and their intentions. I liked very much the juxtaposition of the main characters - the writer Lee Jong-soo, who cannot see the hidden meaning and thus awakens a strong hunger inside himself, which doesn't allow him to sleep and to enjoy a life, to create; his opponent, Ben, a kind of rich Gatsby, quite the opposite one, he is filled with inspiration and understands the true beauty of all things, thus filling himself and everyone around him with a mysterious special flame.

If you haven't watched it, do yourself a favor.It is through this standard and expectation that I view all of Lee Chang-Dong's movies. So far, all of his movies are great but to me, none of them have the impact Peppermint Candy had on me.""Burning"" is no different in that regard. Cinematography-wise, it is on par with his other movies. His style is recognizable here. Somewhat minimalist but not to the extreme, his camera work is never in the way. He let's his scenes breathe so that the actors can express themselves fully. The viewer connects the dots, interprets what's going on with the director eclipsing himself by not favoring any interpretation over the other.With that been said, I feel that the protagonist was a bit undersold/underwritten as a character. He is void of charm, witt, and he is often inconsistent. I wish the ""writer"" side of him was a little bit explored. It is a very important aspect of his character that plays a great role in the plot as a whole. Instead we got your typical ""observer"" character which is unsuitable for the kind of role he shoulders throughout of the movie. Luckily, the rest of the characters carried the movie and made it quite an enjoyable watch. Dan, the rich guy was exceptionally well written and acted. There are many nuances to his character that makes the viewer guess even after the credits role.All in all, apart from the issue with the protagonist, the movie was an enjoyable watch and deserves its place in Lee's respectable filmography.Seriously though, go watch Peppermint Candy.

Definitely some competing goals between atmosphere, grand storytelling, societal commentary, all while trying to package up a narrative that is haunting but loses its pace in doing so because it is trying to satisfy all these competing demands.If the narrative moved up speed and devoted more towards storytelling, this movie would be absolutely perfect and I would have given it a 10/10.

206,dpayne-9,Worth every moment..,9,15 March 2019,"A haunting film that earns its ironic chill(s) slowly and steadily, in the classic thriller tradition. Many have noted the ""slow burning"" quality of the film, but I was often reminded of the obsessions and the spell-casting of ""Vertigo."" The scenes where Jong-su follows Ben's fancy car through the streets of Seoul and Paju provide the most obvious clue. But there is also the disappearing woman (who also recalls the missing women of ""L'Avventura"" and ""The Vanishing""), the suave mystery man who may or may not be a master plotter (or ""player,"" as he says here) and the hapless, lonely guy with a phobia (in this case, violence and fire) that forces him to ""retire"" from reality. The scenes referencing Faulkner and Gatsby are superbly expressive and a testament to the literary legacy Haruki Murakami - who wrote the short story, ""Barn Burning,"" that this film is based on and which appeared in The New Yorker in 1992 - acknowledges and so thoroughly and artfully extends.Among the film's most memorable scenes is the sunset party at Jong-su's farm - scored to nothing less provocative and meaningful than Miles Davis' theme to Louis Malle's 1958 film ""Elevator to the Gallows."" There is beauty - in a film that purposely plays down the natural beauty of Korea - and menace in these scenes: you don't know who is going to do what, but something bad is portended. The creepiest scene for me involves Ben, a woman and a make-up box. Some things in the movie remain utterly unresolved, which is okay, but the film's final scene seemed to come out of nowhere and felt inconclusive or wrong to me. Maybe it depends on who you think the baddie is in all this. I saw a ""Vanishing"" ending coming when it all went rather more ""Vertigo"" or where ""Vertigo"" probably ought to have gone.Steven Yeun is, of course, terrific and newcomer Jong-seo Jun is an undeniably hypnotic presence. Little wonder why Ah-in Yoo - the laconic and passive presence of whom I couldn't take my eyes off - is besotted, despite his ignoring all the alarm bells of amour fou going off around him (recalling Truffaut's underrated ""Mississippi Mermaid""). The director, Chang-dong Lee, did an amazing job here, blending the literary and the cinematic to perfectly poetic pretense, though the film is probably a bit longer than it needs to be. Don't let the running time put you off; this film is worth spending time with...even if you don't get it. It is exactly what Hitchcock called ""pure cinema.""",Burning
207,sbabajim,"Slow-burning, haunting and brilliant",9,8 December 2018,"I entered the theater without really knowing anything about the film, other than it was highly praised by critics and loosely based on a Murakami story that I hadn't read. I understand why some reviewers were put off. Some scenes seem to drag more than what they should, and there are no answers given, although there are many questions and many hints as to what is actually going on. The movie goes beyond the expectations of an audience that is used to fast-paced mystery thrillers and demands a clear-cut resolution (though I have to say here that if you have the patience to connect the dots, the plot and the possibilities are quite clear). If you are willing to be open, then the film certainly pays off for many reasons. It is a beautiful character study of a lonely young woman craving meaning and purpose in life, a cinematically unconventional young man who feels inadequate to fight against class distinction and social prejudice, and an enigmatic, bored, Gatsby-like yuppie. It is rich in subtle social and political commentary. It has a beautiful cinematography. The actors are doing an amazing job. And most importantly there is a slow burning mystery that really gets into your system. Also I was happy to see that the movie avoided the exaggerated sentimentality and melodrama that I have seen in so many other Korean films and opted for a more down-to-earth approach.

212,filmskasekta,Only a fraction of what South Corean cinema can offer,7,12 October 2019,"(I am sorry if there are some grammatical errors or misspelled words, english isn't my primary language)
I am a huge fan of South Corean films. I love and appreciate directors such as Ki-duk Kim (""Spring, summer, fall, winter ... and spring"") , Joon-ho Bong (""Parasite"") and my personal favourite Chan-wook Park (""Oldboy""). However, ""Burning"", directed by Chang-dong Lee (whose other movies i have not seen), is not the best representative of the things that make Sounth Corean movies so good.
The most noticeable thing about them is their originality. Even though they're grounded in reality, they feel incredibly unique. The biggest reason being that they mostly convey information to us visually, sometimes without us even noticing. And whlie this movie has those things, they are not that greatly implemented.
The biggest problem with this film is that it's too slow and boring. Not all movies have to be fun (film is firstly an art form, not just entertaiment), but then they must have some deeper meaning, which this movie lacks, in my opinion. There seem to be some themes about class division and reletionship issues but they are not properly explored. Most of the time the movie feels empty, without purpose, lacking even the most basic plot. Most of the time we just watch the main character in his daliy routine, and when he interacts with other characters, it feels meaningless , most of the time. It isn't until the last hour that the story starts to progress and becomes better and more interesting, but even then it's nothing to write home about. I feel like 45 minutes of this film could've been cut off especially in the first half.
The characters are well devopled (especially the protagonist) but they are either uniteresting (MC and the guy played by Steven Yeun) or annoying (the love interest). Our protagonist is mostly passive, only watching things happen with his mouth open, and even when he becomes active later in the film he makes some strange decisions. The main female character has some quirks which are supposed to make her likeable, but in the end, I liked the movie better when she wasn't on the screen.
With all that being said I still think that the movie is mostly good, sometimes even very good. The acting, the score, the cinematography are all pretty great, but the slow pace and a lot of unnecessary scenes dragged this movie down to a 7/10 for me. I can't recommend it, but I can't say you shouldn't watch it either, so chose for youself.",Burning

It only answers the questions it needs to answer and everything else is left to interpretation. I'll admit the second act could have been shortened a bit but otherwise the movie is outstanding. The lead character is incredibly relatable, the woman is fascinating and I wish we got to see more of her on screen, and the antagonist is perfectly mysterious with an underlying creepiness.

The film brings some suspense which reminded me of some Hitchcock movies from the past. There was also a big difference with Hitchcock though: whereas Hitchcock uses strong acting, imagery and sound to build up the tension, in Burning there are not much scenes which please the eye, it's just all so... normal as is the acting. Furthermore, the script is slow... with several scenes which leave you wondering why you had to witness this information at all. This resulted in several people snoring in the Cinema I saw this screening. 
In all honesty, the film breathes an atmosphere simalar to the books of Murakami, which in my opinion also tend to be more poetic and slow - certainly no page turners and neither is Burning. So if you really like the books of Murakami, this is the film for you I suppose.

It haunts me, and I'll tell you why.The way director Lee Chang-Dong made me experience Jongsu's powerlessness is riveting. I could feel his anger and insecurity when poor Jongsu discovered his 'girlfriend' Hae-Mi accompanied by the shining and rich Ben at the airport. Later on, Hae-Mi goes missing and Jongsu does everything in his power to find her. The suspense and mystery really killed me.I found 'Burning' to be discomforting and haunting. It shows and doesn't tell, which makes you pay attention to little details. Along the way, Chang-Dong gives clues about why Ben is really interested in Hae-Mi (is he really?) I wondered about the tiny bits of phrase or looks on faces that on the first hearing and viewing may seem irrelevant, but from which I experienced an aha-erlebnis while I was biking home from the theatre.For me personally, this movie is a true ten out of ten. I recommend you not to go to the film by yourself, but to have someone with you to discuss its details. If you want to understand everything, you'll have to think.

This mesmerizing character study kicks off with an unexpected encounter between protagonist Lee Jong-su, a quiet, restrained young man who tends to his father's property - located near the border with North Korea, one of the many ways in which the narrative conveys its unique sense of unease - while he battles in court over his alarming anger issues, and Shin Hae-mi, a wide-eyed, lonely girl with an unsettling penchant for pantomime, who finds herself lost, in a perennial journey to find purpose - or the Great Hunger, as she tells an amused Jong-su. As the two get to know each other again, years after Lee disregarded her in school, they engage in a surprisingly delicate and beautifully filmed encounter, whose dreamy quality he tenderly nourishes, only for Hae-mi to quickly escape, some time later, into another one of her trips. When she returns from Nairobi, the thin glimmer of light that is their relationship evaporates, replaced by an ineroxably growing tension. This is due to the introduction of Ben, the ever-smiling and mysterious man she encountered in Africa. Jong-su is visibly taken aback by his presence, and over the course of a few reunions, his uncanny wealth and excesses provide the audience with discomfort - that is, until Hae-mi suddenly vanishes. From then on, the film becomes a feast of paranoia, barely contained fury, and relentless search for the truth. Was her disappearance obvious from the start, a distant girl with nothing to hold on simply cutting all ties with her world? Or does it have something to do with the uncanny hobby Ben revealed to Lee shortly before she finds herself gone? There is nary a moment wasted throughout its long and breathtaking two and a half hours, that elevate its surreal source material to a rare kind of arthouse thriller, whose slow burning quality finally explodes in a cathartic and ultimately unavoidable ending. Bursting with memorable imagery, richly underpinned by a variety of subtexts such as class tension, misogyny, and anger, impeccably acted and miraculously directed, ""Burning"" reveals itself as one of the best movies of year. It is self-contained, agressive, and frantic all at once. A must-see for any fan of Murakami - and for anyone who craves a tale of loss and revenge.",Burning

The actors were good, but wasted on a screenplay that is a mess. Shakespeare could leave us wondering about people's motivations, but regular writers and directors have to help us out. I saw Burning at TIFF, where I felt like smart people were supposed to say they liked it.

237,konradk1887,An extraordinary slow-burn character study,10,4 January 2019,"A marvel, technically and narratively. The dialogue is razor-sharp (at least what I got from the subtitles), the acting natural and authentic, the cinematography stunning and the score superbly minimalistic and fitting. But what is fascinating me the most is the plot and the characters that populate it. There is not even that much happening in here. No big polemic with people shouting at each other. No highly emotional one-take breakdown scene. No big drama. The three central characters, their interactions and their own little demons make the film and make it so fantastic. They are as different as humans could be, socially and characteristically, but wonderfully fleshed out and portrayed.
At some points in the film, some radical changes happen, some things stop making sense. They are all somehow connected and (probably?) have double meanings. Not only does this turn out to be nerve-wracking for the viewer, but also for the main character.
These mystery aspects don't dictate the whole rest of the film though, they are not the center of attention. They drive it forward, especially in the furious second half, but only through the main characters own choices and actions. He is the center. He and his actions, his reactions, his mannerisms, his choices, what makes him this character. Not the mystery. He is just caught in it and tries to make sense of it all, tries to solve it. So does the viewer. The films goal is not to tie all loose ends together. It also doesn't dictate what to get out of it. A classic mystery story or a metaphor for something bigger...all valid. The film did all it had to do, said all it had to say. It got straight to the point, it's all there. The rest is up to me.",Burning

245,fabiaalabraba,Painfully Slow...Certainly not worth the watch,3,6 March 2021,"I find it so dissapointing when I have to go against the grain and say that a film that seems to be so highly rated is actually not good, or average at best. But believe me when I tell you, this is an average film at best. Here are the reasons why....1. THE FILM IS TOO LONG AND THE STORYLINE DOES NOT HOLD ENOUGH INTENSITY TO KEEP YOU INTERESTED. You have a feeling of 'waiting for it to start' the whole way through. It never does. Instead it draaaags all the way till the end.2. THE CHARECTERS' BACKSTORIES WERE NOT DEVELOPED. The viewer was actually partially let in to some interesting backstories regarding Jong-Su's upbringing, his dad , his mum etc. Neither one was, in 2.5 hours, sufficiently explored to give the charecter any depth or to provide context/motive to explain his behaviour. Even Ben, after 2.5 hours of watching we have no idea who he really is, what he does for a living or what motivates him to kill. I mean, come on! I also felt the film did not develop love story between jong-su and hae-mi adequately enough for us to really comprehend a how/why a genuine love had formed.
This i think is the main issue of the film. A long film is bearable only when you are truly invested in either the charecters or the storyline, both of which we were unable to do as the characters' backstories had not been developed and the storyline was completely flat.3. THIS IS MEANT TO BE A MYSTERY FILM BUT THE STORYLINE WAS EXTREMELY PREDICTABLE. At no point did we believe Ben was not the killer. This deduction could be drawn half way through the film. For the painfully long film there were no twist and turns, no shocks, no thrills to keep the viewer on their toes.4. UNREALISTIC. Are we meant to belive he followed Ben in his very distinctive farm utility car for hours and hours and on different occasions and in close proximity on quiet countryside roads without getting noticed? Are we also supposed to believe that Jong-Su feel deeply in love with Hae-mi after a seemingly brief interaction?5. LONG UNNECESSARY SCENES. Lingering wide camera shots.

The movie isn't inherently sad, yet I cried so many times. Something about the quiet, the peacefulness, the sentimentality, I couldn't help but feel greatly emotionally connected to every single scene that occurred.If you're looking for an action filled, on the edge of your seat movie, Burning may not be the cinema you're looking for. The plot takes a bit to build but there was never a moment where my eyes weren't glued to the screen. Every scene felt so raw from the actors as well, how could you ever feel bored? I feel sorry for those who couldn't stand the sheer emptiness of the actors just being in some of the scenes, then they may call this film ""a waste of 2 hours and 30 minutes"".Now, though the movie is good, does it deserve a 10/10? Absolutely. An indescribable feeling comes about as you attempt to decipher multiple mysteries about the movie, as most things go unanswered. Where did Hae-mi go, what happened to her? Where is the burnt down greenhouse? Was there ever really a well near Hae-mi's childhood home? Did Jong-su waste his time feeding a cat that didn't actually exist? Why had Ben been keeping makeup in his bathroom and doing girls makeup? How does Jong-su's fathers incarceration tie in with the plot? These are among the many questions that you must guess the answer to and decide for yourself what you believe happened, and personally, I very much enjoy that aspect of the film, not getting everything handed to you. The movie challenges you to watch it.",Burning
257,simontay78,Theories about the the final 30 minutes of detective work (SPOILERS),9,23 February 2019,"I have to be honest here, at first I was like totally bored and didn't bother to watch much of the movie...until I got to the part when Hae-mi disappeared.SPOILER ALERT!!Let's dissect why Jong-Su did what he did at the end.This movie is totally a mind bending story...so many weird clues that can go few directions.Schrödinger's cat - A cat can be both alive & dead at the same time when it's trapped in a box.The obvious plot (SPOILER) is Ben maybe a serial killer draining his victim's bank account before ""burning the green house"" every two months.But many suspicious plot makes me think it may be a different story...It could be Ben is a professional make up artist that combines his profession with prostituting himself to rich ladies. yeah a professional gigolo when rich ladies splurge lot's of money on him...so that he can afford the sports car, fancy house & gathering of rich ladies.His ""burning of green house"" could be just a way to ditch ladies who are getting too attached to him, that is why he laugh when Jong-Su declare his love for Hae-mi and didn't suspect Jong-Su at the end and ask if he came with Hae-mi.So the twist is the following which is my own theorySPOILER ALERT!!Hae-Mi is a hired assassin that is a professional killer who specialised in recruiting unwitting innocent men into killing the target.1. Hae-mi says she had plastic surgery done which doesn't look like Hae-mi original look. So she can be ANYONE pretending to be Hae-mi.2. Hae-mi uses her body to seduce Jong-Su after immediately knowing he doesn't have a girlfriend. Simple & direct recruiting of lustful lonely man to do her bidding.3. Invisible cat name Boil that doesn't seemed to appear before Jong-Su, my suspicion is that the cat doesn't exist but fake Hae-mi could have bought a pet cat name boil when the time is right to make Ben adopt the ""stray"" cat. If it's a cat Hae-Mi brought over to Ben...Ben would already know it's name but Ben could be telling the truth that he haven't name the cat yet.4. Hae-mi lied about falling into the dry well when she is 7 years old & Jong-Su was the hero which he doesn't even remember. Why the two store keepers (I think is Hae-Mi's family members) & the old man don't remember that particular well but Jong-Su's mother remember? His mother is in debt, and money can buy anyone's tongue easily...to lie.5. The watch that Jong-Su gave to Hae-mi could be planted by Hae-mi anytime she was at Ben's house...6. Motive, why someone want to kill Ben? I am suspecting one of Ben's victim (still alive) being drained of their bank account & ditched every two months can be one or many reasons he was targeted to be killed.Timing of Hae-mi disappearance is RIGHT after Jong-Su declare his love for Hae-mi & his jealous criticism of her stripping in front of men too easily...is pretty obvious is the best timing to get Jong-Su to follow the planted clues to determine that Ben is a serial killer & Hae-mi may be his victim.btw his father could be covering up Jong-Su's own crime of burning green house as I'm looking into his few seconds dream about a burning green house & his father's long stare towards Jong-Su.So Jong-Su could already be a suspected arsonist that's why his part on the lighter....the fake Hae-Mi probably knows this from the real Hae-Mi hence selected Jong-Su to be the ONE to do it at the ending.With prior arson experience, lonely & lustful, fake Hae-mi can easily manipulate Jong-Su to do her bidding.",Burning

278,yoboiwatched,Everyone should definetly check this out.,8,12 September 2019,"I thought this movie was going to be about someone jogging and some romance stuff but boy was I wrong. This is a slow burn movie that at first I was bored by but when I laid down to go to sleep, I started thinking about all the stuff I wanted to say in my review. This leads me to read a long Reddit thread for about a good hour and messaging people that voted on my poll their thoughts/theories. It was a blast. A movie hasn't done this to me before. Usually, I slowly read through stuff but I jammed everything into my sleep-deprived brain.Jung-Su meets Shin Hae-Mi who he hasn't seen since his childhood. They talk and sleep with each other, he feeds her cat while she is on a trip, and after a trip, she comes back with another dude. Sounds simplistic right? Good luck because surface level it seems to be but the more you realize how out of place things seem to be on reflection you should realize that there is a strong director at hand. There is a focus on what to show us and let us work out as a viewer of what is going on. I love movies that make you work.For the first half of the film, I was bored. It seemed to just be building character but it wasn't until the second half that I had an oh crap moment of why scenes were the way they were. All the performances are good. I was surprised that I recognized an actor, Steven Yung, from The Walking Dead. He was one of my favorites when I saw that show a million years ago. In my opinion, he gives the best performance.The cinematography is excellent. I loved the locations and the way they were captured. I liked the music.I do think that the scene where Hae-Mi dancing in the sunset went on a bit too long. There are scenes I want to complain about but in retrospect, they were important on the plot or building character like the court scenes.The craftsmanship of this film is amazing and you should definitely check this movie out. Even if it doesn't seem like your thing SEE IT. Strong Recommend. - I saw it because I thought I was going to go through my 2018 list then decided to go through my 2009 watchlist. My watchlist is huge.",Burning
279,marlowefwilson,a slow burn,7,18 February 2021,"This is a thought provoking movie to say the least. The acting is amazing and although slow, it takes an interesting perspective on how an obsession can turn into a killing.My favorite scene is the makeup scene--it is absolutely gorgeous.",Burning
280,Khedro69,Struggle For Salvation,8,14 April 2019,"When I come across a mysterious movie that is like a puzzle, I'd like to first gather all the pieces that are there.Haemi:
She has left her childhood place, her whole family, she's in debt, has no friends. She's clearly escaping something, a part of herself like her past.Another important thing about Haemi is the stories she tell about her childhood that are not clear whether they are real or lie since Jong Su doesn't remember them.She has a cat which very much has the same quality that she has, stray.The little light she gets on her wall means a lot to her.Her room is really messy which signifies her messed up life.""He's my one and only friend."" and ""He's the only person I trust."", referring to Jong Su.Little Hunger (her past) - Big Hunger (Salvation)Jong Su:
Everyone seems to be leaving him: mother, father, sister, Haemi, and even his calf.Just like Haemi, he has problems that root in his past.He's also looking for salvation (waiting in Haemi's room for light to get on the wall).His care for greenhouses is perhaps because they represent his identity, the place and culture he grew up in.Helping Boeling (not sure if I got the cat's name correctly) means helping Haemi to him since they basically represent the same idea.Her concerns for Haemi are probably because she is the last thing remaining from his past and he's actually fighting his past trying to prove himself that he's not forsaken: he's not destined to be left by everyone.His hanging jaw signifies his uncertainty and lack of confidence.Ben:
Confident, apparently satisfied, and most importantly a player (as he admits that).The cosmetics box and the accessory drawer strengthen his claim of being a player.Seeing a new girl right after Haemi goes missing, putting makeup on her face, keeping Boeling and the accessories (from his previous victims), smiling at Jong Su every time he goes to one of his gatherings, they all show that he is confident about what he does even when Jong Su becomes suspicious.When he tells Jong Su that he has this habit of burning greenhouses every two months, he's not really talking about greenhouses. By greenhouse he means Haemi who is that ""greenhouse really close to Jong Su.""Even though Burning is not a hard film to understand for many, I had to do quite some serious thinking to fully grasp it. At the scene when Ben is cooking for Haemi and Jung So, Lee Chang Dong gives us the key to the whole mystery: metaphor. Without it I probably couldn't realize the reasoning behind many of the actions and emotions I witnessed in the movie.To put it all together, Haemi is a stray who is escaping her past seeking the meaning of life in a fragile, desperate condition. Her plastic surgery, her sleeping with Jong Su even though she still carries the scar he left her in childhood (""You are really ugly.""), and the anecdotes she recites are all sings of a battle inside her, a struggle for salvation. Also we must keep in mind that it was Jong Su who rescued her from the bottom of the well while she was crying and looking up at the round sky and sunlight. He is like a savior angel to her who came down from the heavens (considering the circumstances). The momentary sunlight she gets on her wall every day shows how hopeless her life is. It's in fact a metaphor for Jung Su, her only hope, but when Ben comes around with everything that Jung Su isn't, she gives in to her desires: immediate escape from the past. Although it later becomes clear that she still has only one real hope (""He's the only person I trust."")In a similar way, Jong Su has serious issues in his past and his way of fighting them is his struggle to prove himself that not everyone has to leave him. He's not confident for most of the film, but when he's left with no options but to face his problem head on, he gathers all his strengths and wipes away one of the causes of his problems. Even though he doesn't solve anything (in the way we define ""solve""), he does the best he could do. By stripping and burning his cloths alongside Ben and his fancy car, he cleanses himself of everything he hates. That is when he eventually finds salvation.",Burning

I was intrigued because of the 7.5 rating and kept thinking/waiting there must be a plot twist or dramatic ending. Nope. Pretty much the opposite and I'm pissed I got so invested in this mystery. If the main character was acting as a mentally handicapped person he did great. Bens character and subtle clues kept me interested in the mystery or the score would have been lower.",Burning
284,stahlefrid-81432,A movie that doesn't look down on it's viewer,9,27 September 2020,"The shortcommings of this film is that it's long and a little slow at times. I watched this with a friend who's kind of a movie geek like me. He absolutely disliked the film beacuse of it's slowness and beacuse he felt that only Steven Yeun (Ben) was charismatic enough to carry the movie.I think this opinion stems comes from that this movie requires alot of thinking and trying to understand the characters. I personally think that's the recipe for a great film.
I can understand why people wouldn't enjoy this film, but at least from my experience: it's amazing.The interesting about this film is that nothing is shoved in your face, everything is very neatly presented. I think the main actor (Ah-In Yoo) did a great job capturing the character and building a connection with the audience. That makes some turns in this movie really hit you like a sledgehammer.",Burning

The cinematography was beautiful, the story was compelling (if a little slow), in several contrasting acts, but the writing was a little ham fisted at times.
