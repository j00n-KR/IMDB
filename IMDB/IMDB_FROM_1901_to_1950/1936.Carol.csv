0,SnoopyStyle,good but a bit too long,7,12 December 2016,It's 1952 Christmas season. Carol Aird (Cate Blanchett) is looking for a doll for her daughter. She strikes up an attraction to shop girl Therese Belivet (Rooney Mara). Therese's possessive boyfriend Richard Semco (Jake Lacy) is leery of her new friendship. Carol is in a destructive divorce negotiation with husband Harge (Kyle Chandler) over their daughter. He is still angry at her relationship with her childhood friend Abby Gerhard (Sarah Paulson).I can't help but think this subject matter would be edgier back ten or twenty years ago. It would have made this movie more compelling. It's still a good forbidden romance. Cate Blanchett is amazing as always. Rooney Mara does a good job. Kyle Chandler delivers a great angry white man. Jake Lacy is creepily clingy. The start is a little slow and the ending drags on too long. The movie seems to climax with Cory Michael Smith. I would have liked for the movie to wrap up quickly after the lawyers' meeting. The ending runs on too long.,Carol
1,boblipton,The Joys Of Being Miserable,6,4 April 2021,"Rooney Mara is manning a desk at a department store when mink-coated Cate Blanchett comes by to figure out what she can buy for her son's Christmas. When Miss Blanchett departs, she leaves her gloves. Miss Rooney calls her to rturn them and soon they begin an affair.It's a movie based on a novel Patricia Highsmith published under a pen name lest she be typed as a writer of homosexual fiction. Todd Haynes directs coldly, with the early 1950s reproduced in a perfect exhibition of set design, and while the leading ladies are, as you might expect, perfect, it's yet another Highsmith adaptation that leaves me unmoved Everyone is is either clueless, predatory, or both, and Edward Lachman's lighting leaves everyone looking bloodless. Yes, I get it. The Old Days were terrible; no one could be themselves, everyone had to pretend, and everyone was miserable. I'm left with the thought of John Sullivan grinding ten thousand feet of hard luck, and wondering when someone is going to shove him back to Hollywood so he can make ANTS IN YOUR PLANTS OF 1942.Carter Burwell's score is in a minor key, of course.",Carol
2,Horst_In_Translation,Sacrifice and sensuality,6,25 December 2015,"""Carol"" is a 2015 movie and considered one of the big awards contenders this season. Let us start with the people we do not see in the film. Writer Patricia Highsmith is responsible for novels like ""The Talented Mr. Ripley"" and ""Strangers on a Train"" (turned into a movie by Hitchcock). 2015 is the 20th anniversary of her death, so it's a nice way to honor her literary legacy. Phyllis Nagy is the one who adapted her work for this film here. She has only written (and directed) one television movie so far and that was already ten years ago, but that one back then, ""Mrs. Harris"", received lots of awards attention too. Director Todd Haynes is known for writing his own films most of the time, but here he was ""only"" the one directing. His most known works so far include Kate Winslet's ""Mildred Pierce"", ""Far from Heaven"" and ""I'm Not There"", another Cate Blanchett movie and that one is from 8 years ago.Talking about Cate Blanchett, she is the big star in here and I am slowly (or quickly) beginning to become a great fan of hers. Occasionally, she seemed somewhat cold and unemotional to me in past works, but this may only have been my wrongful perception. I loved her in ""Blue Jasmine"" and she is excellent as the title character in ""Carol"" as well. It's tough to pick a favorite scene as she shines for 2 hours from start to finish of the movie, but I really liked her moment of revelation during the hearing with the lawyers towards the end. Oscar-worthy. She also has good chemistry with her co-star Rooney Mara. Mara, who was pushed back and forth between lead and supporting all awards season, won a Palme d'Or for her performance here and, like Blanchett, got nominations from many other crucial awards bodies, so the two are basically locks for Oscar nominations. I must say she is good, but nowhere near Blanchett's level, so I was slightly underwhelmed by her portrayal here. Lacy, Paulson and (especially) Chandler give convincing supporting performances here too. I especially liked the scene in which we see Chandler's character's eyes through the door after Paulson's character closed said door on him.Finally, there were three or four great moments, but sadly as a whole, even if I really enjoyed this film at times, I cannot say it was totally mind-blowing for me or anything that I would consider among the best of the year. Thumbs up as well for the soundtrack and all the visual aspects of the film. If you like the historic tone and context of ""Mad Men"", you will appreciate the stylistic side of ""Carol"" for sure too. It is a story about a woman who has to give up on love (for a little while) in order to be allowed to see her daughter. Homosexuality was still mostly a taboo back then - times were entirely different - and this aspect also makes it very much worth a watch for the historic context. Of course, it's also worth seeing for the difficult and complex relationships between the characters. A well-rounded effort by Haynes here and I can see why he and the film are getting so much praise. I recommend the watch. Thumbs up.",Carol
3,Prismark10,Struggling for love,5,30 April 2017,"Carol is a film set in the 1950s that deals with a forbidden lesbian love affair between well heeled Carol (Cate Blanchett) whose marriage is over but her husband Harge (Kyle Chandler) is not over her and Therese (Rooney Mara) a younger woman who works in a department store but aspires to be a photographer.Todd Haynes directs a film adapted from a novel by author Patricia Highsmith. Carol and Therese have an instant attraction but need to carry out their affair discreetly especially as her divorce gets messy and the ongoing custody battle even messier.The film is small scale and beautiful to look at but it really did not amount to much, unfolding slowly and not even too melodramatic.The film makes a point of how badly women were treated at the time for deviating from what was regarded as normal. Carol is at risk of losing custody of her daughter due to her immoral behaviour which shapes how her relationship with Therese develops.",Carol
4,kosmasp,Carol ends with an L,7,25 July 2016,"As in ""Love"" or maybe something else. Which could be the same, right? But before I get ahead of myself and try to jump to the ending, let's start from the beginning. Cate Blanchett is playing her role ""straight"" as always (no pun intended) and if you did not read what kind of a love story this is, you might not notice immediately what direction this is heading.You can tell there is trouble, you can also tell there is misunderstood love and unappreciated love too. And people who are hurt do things that do seem desperate. Another thing to know is that there is nudity. Just in case you missed the MPAA rating and it's essential to the plot, also handled delicately. Whatever you may think of characters motivation and how they act upon it, will determine your feelings at the end of the movie ....",Carol
5,gavin6942,Well-Crafted Romance Ruined By Score and Editing,7,8 February 2016,"An aspiring photographer (Rooney Mara) develops an intimate relationship with an older woman (Cate Blanchett).Before going in to this film, I initially believed it was one that should have made the cut for Best Picture in place of ""Brooklyn"", especially given how little ""Brooklyn"" had going for it. Having now seen them both, I think the right decision was made. Perhaps ""The Danish Girl"" deserved the boost, but ""Brooklyn"" is the superior film to ""Carol"".What ""Carol"" has going for it, of course, is a well-acted romance. Cate Blanchett is at her finest, a lesbian who has tried and failed to live a ""normal"" life. She had a husband she could not love and a child she does, and it was emotionally damaging to her. Blanchett portrays this range well, someone wise enough and confident enough to know what they want, and yet aware they are in a world that cannot allow it.Rooney Mara is coming from the opposite end. Her character is naive and still learning the ways of the world. She seemingly does not know her own feelings, at least at first, being pursued by a man but not necessarily knowing why she is not interested in him. Her story is one of discovery. At times we almost feel she is being taken advantage of, though this is not the intent. Mara just does such a fine job of successfully communicating the life of a young woman who does not yet know her place in the world.Why this story fails, though, is because of the pace. What could be a steady, moving story of romance and a photographer who is moving up in the world tends to drag. The score could put an audience to sleep and the editing does little to keep the film moving. All the hard work that went into making these characters is hindered by their being trapped in a slow, thudding picture.The nominations include score (which seems wrong) and cinematography (which is fair but there is nothing spectacular here). There is also adapted screenplay, which I could not say one way or the other without reading Patricia Highsmith's novel. So for these it is a no, a no and a maybe. I would also expect no win in costume design. So we have four nominations (very impressive) but nothing to show for it.Where we might see an award is in the acting category. Both Blanchett and Mara were nominated. Unfortunately for Blanchett, she was nominated for Best Actress, a category that almost certainly will go to Brie Larson for ""Room"". Mara is considered a Supporting Actress, which makes her biggest contender Jennifer Jason Leigh for ""Hateful Eight"". And I would not count out Alicia Vikander for ""Danish Girl"", either.In short, we have six nominations, five of which are not likely to become wins. Rooney Mara is the film's best bet to win an Oscar, but she has a little competition. It would be hard to decide, as Leigh seems to be the front-runner and personally I thought Vikander was great.",Carol
6,lee_eisenberg,romance amid constriction,10,2 January 2016,"Todd Haynes has made a career directing movies focusing on transgressive and complex eroticism. His movies ""Safe"" and ""Far from Heaven"" looked at suburban housewives whose seemingly ideal lives get upended. He continues this tradition with ""Carol"", based on a book by Patricia Highsmith.Cate Blanchett plays a 1950s affluent woman going through a divorce who strikes up a relationship with a shopgirl played by Rooney Mara. Their lives couldn't be more different: Blanchett's Carol is the embodiment of 1950s glamor, while Mara's Therese lives in an apartment and is still trying to make a go of it in photography. Sure enough, Carol's husband uses the relationship against her in divorce proceedings.Like ""Far from Heaven"", ""Carol"" concentrates on the social constrictions of the era. There's something hidden behind the facade of the classy, stylish worlds that the protagonists of both movies inhabit. The supposedly happy wives see their comfortable lifestyles fall apart. Their only path to any further joy is a relationship that was taboo in the 1950s.This has to be one of the year's best movies. I've liked every Todd Haynes movie that I've seen (another one is the Bob Dylan-themed ""I'm Not There""). I hope that he continues making these sorts of movies, and I hope that this movie receives some Oscar nods. Everything about it is perfect.",Carol
7,jboothmillard,Carol,9,10 December 2015,"I saw the review for this on Film 2015 with Claudia Winkleman and Danny Leigh, it got great praise and was chosen as ""film of the week"", it certainly sounded like something I would enjoy, so I went to the cinema with great anticipation, from BAFTA and Golden Globe nominated director Todd Haynes (Safe, Far from Heaven). Basically, set in the early 1950s, temporary shop girl Therese Belivet (Oscar, BAFTA and Golden Globe nominated Rooney Mara) is working in a Manhattan department store in the toy department during the Christmas season. She is approached by older woman Carol Aird (Oscar, BAFTA and Golden Globe nominated Cate Blanchett), who from There's recommendation purchases a train set as a gift for her daughter, Carol accidentally leaves her gloves behind on the counter, so Therese mails them to her home in New Jersey. Carol meanwhile is going through a difficult divorce with neglectful husband Harge (Super 8's Kyle Chandler), and struggling to maintain custody of daughter Rindy (twins Sadie and Kk Heim). Having had her gloves returned, feeling lonely and wanting to show her gratitude, Carol invites Therese to lunch, she also invites her to her home for Christmas, they strike up a friendship. Therese aspires to be a photograph, and takes several pictures of Carol from a distance as she buys a Christmas tree, Harge is suspicious of his wife's relationship with Therese, as years ago she and her best friend Abby Gerhard (Sarah Paulson) had a fling, he goes on a business trip to Florida, taking Rindy with him. Carol and Therese also invoke anger from Therese'e boyfriend Richard Semco (Jake Lacy) as their friendship continues to grow, she does not love him, and he admitted to sleeping with two other women during their relationship, they break up, he tells Therese that Carol will be rid of her soon. To escape the stress of the break up and the divorce, Carol and Therese decide to take a road trip together to Chicago, Carol gives a new camera and film to Therese as a gift. On New York's Eve, Carol and Therese finally acknowledge their strong romantic feelings for each other, making love for the first time in their motel room. During their trip they met Tommy Tucker (Cory Michael Smith) who was a masquerading as a salesman, in fact he is a private investigator hired by Harge to follow them and record evidence of their affair. The audio tapes have already been sent to Harge, and will be used against Carol in the custody hearings for Rindy, Carol suddenly leaves for New York to fight for her daughter, Therese tries calling her, but Carol hangs up, realising she cannot continue their relationship if she wants any chance of seeing her daughter again. Evidence against Carol is too incriminating, she tearfully allows Harge to have full custody of Rindy, but begs for visitation rights, threatening to take the matter to court if he refuses. Therese meanwhile over a few months, with the help of writer friend Dannie McElroy (John Magaro), becomes a photographer for The New York Times, and admires the photos of Carol she took during their time together. Therese and Carol finally reconnect at the Ritz-Carlton, Carol telling that she works at a furniture store and is allowed to visit Rindy twice a month, the divorce has settled and Carol invites Therese to live with her in her apartment, but Therese refuses, still upset by her previous rejection. Therese accepts a party invitation with Richard later that same night, but finds she cannot socially connect with any of the guests, Therese leaves and goes to the restaurant where Carol is, as she approaches and the two smile warmly seeing each other. Also starring Carrie Brownstein as Genevieve Cantrell, Kevin Crowley as Fred Haymes and Nik Pajic as Phil McElroy. Blanchett as usual gives a great performance as the older alluring woman trapped in and ending a loveless marriage, Mara has had a varied career, but here proves a fantastic choice as the naive shop clerk, the two are perfectly matched as the lesbian lovers, it is a simple story of forbidden love in a time where being gay was controversial, the film cleverly balances emotional melodrama and tenderness between characters, and the recreated 1950s backgrounds and costumes are beautifully accurate, an intelligent, atmospheric and must see romantic drama. It was nominated the Oscars for Best Writing, Adapted Screenplay, Best Cinematography, Best Costume Design, and Best Music, Original Score for Carter Burwell, it was nominated the BAFTAs for Best Adapted Screenplay, Best Cinematography, Best Production Design, Best Costume Design, Best Makeup and Hair, and Best Film, and it was nominated the Golden Globe for Best Motion Picture - Drama, and Best Original Score. Very good!",Carol
8,rmax304823,Suave.,7,29 October 2016,"Many reviewers have commented on the precision with which the movie captures New York in the early 1950s and they're right. The photography too is exquisite and so is the source music and Carter Burwell's moody underscore. This story of two women who fall in love was originally from Patricia Highsmith (who else?) and although I haven't read the novel I can't imagine that its filming has done it any harm. There have been a number of movies about lesbianism lately and I'm always happy when the couple ride off into the sunset together.But tales like that have to be careful. The human mind tends to work in binary fashion. If something has a valence, there must be an opposite valence. Matter must have its anti-matter. And if you're rooting for two lesbians, as I always am, the natural opposition is the heterosexual male. It's all to easy to develop men as bruts. This isn't a simple-minded conflict of the sexes though. Everyone involved is too sophisticated for that. The dominant male is Kyle Chandler's character, named ""Harg Aird."" Well, he doesn't have to be too much of a douche bag with a name like that. He was defeated at birth.He's Carol's divorced husband and he still loves her but when she resignedly blows him off he turns venomous and denies Carol any visits to their child. Destiny fulfilled. He has his good qualities -- and Kyle Chandler can handle roles peerlessly -- but ultimately he's vindictive.We can see why he's still devoted to his ex wife. Cate Blanchett is not a kid anymore and there's the rich hint of the predatory in her slitted eyes as she swishes around in her expensive fur coat; at least it looks expensive to me, although for all I can tell it may be muskrat. But she's far from aggressive. Rather her approach to her intended amour is casual and friendly, inviting, not challenging. Rooney Mara as the repressed mousy shop girl comes very close to being a stereotype. It's not the actress' fault; she's playing the role as written. Her eyes have been darkened and she seems to be peering out of some hiding place in the shadows like a timid raccoon. The direction by Todd Haynes is sensitive but firm. No razzle dazzle, thank God. The camera never rolls upside down or does a toe dance. And there are scenes, exchanges or glances, that last only a second or two but still are pregnant with meaning. Nice job.When you strip off the living flesh from the story and bare the buried armature, what you see is actually pretty familiar. Switch Carol's sex and you get ""poor girl marries rich man."" Lose the laughs, give it a few tweaks, and you have ""Pretty Woman"" or ""Working Girl,"" except that the stories have now turned from comedies to tear jerkers. Whatever the underlying theme, though, these two actresses could hardly be better.",Carol
9,moonspinner55,"""'What are you thinking?' Do you know how many times a day I ask you that?""",5,26 November 2016,"Intelligently-crafted, tastefully produced and presented film about a lesbian love affair in 1950s Manhattan. Rooney Mara is a shopgirl (and aspiring photographer!) who meets and is fascinated by Cate Blanchett, an upscale married lady with a young daughter who is somewhat more seasoned in matters of the heart than her new young friend. They embark on a car trip together--with subtle implications they will soon consummate their relationship--but Blanchett's estranged husband is threatening to sue his wife for sole custody of their child on the grounds of immoral behavior. Director Todd Haynes, working from Phyllis Nagy's adaptation of Patricia Highsmith's novel ""The Price of Salt,"" allows the narrative to unfold slowly (matching the cautious central relationship) and, although he frames the picture in flashback for no particular purpose, it's an absorbing story with a thoughtful, interesting character portrait by Blanchett. The problem is most likely the continual lack of dialogue; perhaps hoping to skirt banality, Nagy eliminates basic chit-chat between the two women, which in this case isn't helpful. We get too many close-ups of Mara staring forlornly out of car windows, or walking through gloomy-dark rooms, without understanding her connection to this troubled older lady in a bad marriage (gender not being the issue, they're just not a plausible couple). Handsome picture is saddled with male supporting performances that don't quite come off (the actors and their dialogue seem anachronistic), while a legal midsection doesn't provide the dramatic fire we should have gotten from the ladies on their trip. Still, a thoughtfully-considered and smooth piece of work that might have stood a bit more heart. ** from ****",Carol
10,Quinoa1984,"excellent acting, good movie",7,29 December 2015,"Carol is a story of two people, they happen to be women but they could be anybody, who find each other and find a connection and love. It's the circumstances and timing that makes the conflicts more than anything, the external forces around Carol (Cate Blanchett) and Therese (Rooney Mara) that makes it very difficult to be together; it's the early 1950's and even though it's the North-East (seemingly liberal terrain) it's the world of upper-middle class whiteness where things are simple and plain and heterosexual (on the surface). The core of the movie are these two women, and director Todd Haynes has two of the magnificent actors working, man or woman, working today with Blanchett and (a strikingly beautiful/adorable) Mara, and it's a pleasure to see them with full-blown chemistry.The other question is if it's a great film, or at least one of the best of the year? Well, first of all, it is worth seeing, I'll say that for sure. What it accomplishes that surprised me is that it's not a simple Lesbian-message-love-story screed. We've had plenty of those, albeit not one maybe with some more mainstream appeal outside of the art-house world like this may and should. But I think that the interest in the more intellectual sense is that it's simply a movie about a system that keeps (or kept, maybe it still does) women without power. Case in point, Carol and her ex-husband Harge (Kyle Chandler, kind of the same as Dennis Quaid in Far From Heaven in the sense of uptight masculinity), who can't seem to agree on a custody agreement with their young daughter. Carol may lose her daughter forever because... well, she is in love with another woman? She probably would've lost custody if it was just another man. It seems like a suffocating system in this film.And yet what I think works in terms of the content of the story of showing the trouble of this intimacy being possible - and there is intimacy here, but in a grown-up, compelling way - may not work 100% with the style. This is not to say it's not beautifully photographed; this is different work we normally don't get to see in movies with such big names, and Ed Lachmann makes it seem desaturated but pretty, like a color photograph that's faded over time (and on Super 16mm no less, kind of the same but lo-fi reverse of what Tarantino did this year in 70mm). But I felt like Haynes' direction made what was at times fascinating cinematography to also make a distance with the characters.This may be useful to illustrate a point, about this environment. I found ultimately it took away for me what was the potential to connect with the characters. At the point I should've at least had a lump in my throat, let alone tears, when Carol and Therese have their trials and tribulations, I didn't really feel anything - nor with the ending, which I'll get to in a moment. This may be a fault on my part, and if you feel something deep and powerful here, that's more than fine, I may just be missing something. But I think it felt a little too deliberate at times, everything looks SO perfect here with the costumes and sets and place and time, and it becomes... staid, a little poised, even with the actors.It may sound like I don't like the movie, but I did, at times very much so. There wasn't any one thing through most of the run time that took me out of the movie. I was with the journey of these women (also an interesting supporting role for Sara Paulsen, who has the kind of character detail I really appreciate to see in a story like this), and their rise and fall in such a short period of time is never less than fascinating, and Blanchett and Mara do very well in their realizations of these people as fully 3-dimensional humans. The only ones who sort of suffer character-wise are the men, even for Kyle Chandler who is giving it his all; they were slightly one-dimensional, basically there to set up bullet points or obstacles for the characters. This may also be something I missed on a first viewing, but I think this may be deliberate too: it's very much a feminist film, and that's a wonderful thing, except that it should be something where all the characters have depth, not just the women.One last point I'd like to make is the ending. It's one of those times I'm uncertain how to feel about it; I won't spoil it, though it's more of an emotional point than anything like plot-wise. But there is a point where it should have ended (you see it near the beginning actually) and it would have added a level of mature-tragic dimension, not unlike the ending of Manhattan or something (seeing how one character grows apart from the other, but in a way that makes sense). It's ultimately a kind of happy ending, and yet I'm unsure that was the note to end on - this is 50's melodrama, and for 90% of the time it's successful by updating itself. Let me put it this way: it's a waste of Carrie Brownstein.",Carol
11,tavm,Carol was a fine exploration of what was considered socially acceptable at the time,10,27 January 2016,"Just saw this with my movie theatre-working friend. He thought the ending was weird but we were both quiet during the entire movie with him breathing during some of the emotional scenes. I'm thinking he might be having this one on his mind for a while. It's certainly worth doing so and it's such a compelling drama of the social and sexual mores of the time it's set in. Both Cate Blanchett and Rooney Mara do fine in their roles and I really liked the way their characters interacted with each other. I also liked the performances of Kyle Chandler and Sarah Paulson in the roles they did, having been fans of their work for TV and other films. So on that note, I highly recommend Carol as the exploration of what it was like then compared to now.",Carol
12,edwagreen,**1/2,6,9 October 2016,"I was very disappointed with this film. Apparently, these two women were born at the wrong time and face indignation by others for their lesbian affair. Both are neurotic, needy, sexually repressed women. It can certainly be said that Carol got more than she bargained for with her meeting with Therese at the department store where the latter worked in the Toy Department.The last time I heard the name Therese in a movie was Blanche Yurka's truly memorable performance as Therese De Farge in ""A Tale of Two Cities."" Yurka's Therese was a firebrand revolutionary in France during the 1789 upheaval. It may be argued that Therese, calmly played by Rooney Mara, is also such a revolutionary as women were questioning their sexuality.While Kate Blanchett did an admirable job in the title role, at times I thought her character was comedic. Wearing those mink coats and other fancy items showed that financially how different she was from Therese. I imagined Carol Burnett in still another take-off a film. It would have been hilarious.The picture does do a good job of capturing the 1950s look and attitudes for the period. Kyle Chandler, as Blanchett's husband, shows some dramatic flare here. His two scenes are memorable.I expected more from the Rooney role and am surprised that she received a supporting Oscar nomination for it.The film just doesn't grab you.",Carol
13,michaelRokeefe,Slow burning love affair.,7,16 September 2016,"CAROL is a deliberate, structured melodrama that is set in the 1950s during the buttoned-down era that found lesbian romance very taboo. A wealthy New York socialite named Carol Aird (Cate Blanchette) and a meek young department store clerk Therese Belivet (Rooney Mara) enter a carefully orchestrated attachment. Carol and her husband Harge (Kyle Chandler) are at perpetual odds in a relationship that is only bound by the love of a young daughter. Carol needs to get away from thoughts of impending divorce proceedings and invites her young love interest on a road trip.The story is a slow burner and any lack of dialogue can be overlooked by the expressive eye contact and quiet body language. Blanchette and Mara are refreshing and heartfelt. There is obvious chemistry on display. Others in the cast: Sarah Paulson, Jake Lacy, Cory Michael Smith and Carrie Brownstein.A terrific soundtrack features: Pattie Page, Jo Stafford, The Clovers, Pee Wee King, Billie Holiday, The Four Aces, Woody Herman and Perry Como.",Carol
14,sunwarrior13,A Forbidden Love Affair,9,31 October 2016,"Cate Blanchett and Rooney Mara stars in this drama entitled Carol,which tells a story of a forbidden love affair between a young, beautiful and aspiring female photographer and an older woman who is going through a difficult divorce.Included in the cast are Sarah Paulson, Jake Lacy and Kyle Chandler.This was based on the 1952 romance novel The Prince Of Salt by Patrician Highsmith. Set during the 1950's in New York,a young department stork female clerk named Therese meets Carol,a glamorous woman who seemed to be trapped in an unhappy marriage of convenience.Their meeting starts into a friendship that later develops into a love affair between the two women.As a result,we get to see Carol find the necessary determination to leave her husband.Later,we see Carol's husband questioning her about becoming a mother.Then,it was later revealed to her former spouse that her relationship with other women such as her bestfriend Abby and Therese are more than just friendships.This was definitely one of the better films released during the year it was shown.Although I found the love affair between Carol and Therese somewhat too subtle to the point that something was missing,Cate Blanchett and Rooney Mara did well in their performances.Added to that, we also get to see how difficult it was being a gay or a lesbian during the 1950's due to limited acceptance they have had during that time period.",Carol
15,Theo Robertson,"Light , Gentle Touches On A Heavy Subject",7,30 December 2015,"Todd Haynes ? Yeah I remember him . Something of an auteur when it comes to independent film making , but just because someone is an auteur it doesn't make them superior to the journeyman type of director . Indeed auteur can defined as ""A director who is somewhat unimaginative in telling a visual narrative"" . He also directed SAFE one of the most frustrating films I've ever seen . With CAROL Haynes directs a film featuring a lesbian love story . As the opening credits rolled I also found out it was a Film 4 production . Todd Haynes , lesbians and Film 4 Productions . I don't want to sound like George Dubya Bush but if there was such a thing as an axis of film evil this might just be it!!!! SUGGESTIVE SPOILERS !!!! I'm very surprised then as to how much and how quickly CAROL drew me in to the story . Of course it's somewhat predictable in the early stages with a young shop worker Therese noticing and becoming infatuated by an older woman called Carol but everything is done with a deft , delicate slightness of touch it's difficult not to be caught up in the story . This is down to Haynes and the two protagonists played by Rooney Mara as Therese and Cate Blanchett as the titular Carol . It's rare that I see a film where an actors expression says a thousand words but you're able to instantly see thought and subtext being portrayed without a single word being spoken . It's also rare for a film nowadays to be poignant without lapsing in to manipulation and grief whoring It's not perfect . It gets a bit melodramatic towards the end and the slow languid pace will undoubtedly put some people off but it's not a film produced for the local multiplex . Likewise if the protagonists had been a middle aged straight man and a hetrosexual young woman we'd have an entirely different and possibly as unlikely story but let's appreciate CAROL for what it is - subtle Oscar bait material that might just surprise the Oacar board in 2016",Carol
16,preppy-3,Slow but excellent lesbian love story,8,4 April 2021,This is set in 1950s New York. Unhappily married Carol (Cate Blanchett) meets young Therese (Rooney Mara). They develop a friendship which slowly becomes a love affair. However Carol is divorcing her husband and involved in a nasty custody battle for their only child. If it's found out she's a lesbian she loses custody. What to do?Slow but never dull. Beautifully directed by Todd Haynes with a great eye for how the 1950s looked. There's also a great script and two powerhouse performances by Mara and Blanchett. The one sex scene shown is explicit yet tastefully done. My only complaint is that it is slow. Still it's well worth seeing.,Carol
17,writers_reign,Sapphic Traffic,6,10 December 2015,"After about a third of the way through this fine film I became so distracted by Roona Mara's striking resemblance to the late Jean Simmons (at roughly the age Mara is now) that it was difficult to remain focused on the film itself. The good thing is that the Simmons' performances date from her debut in the early forties and into the fifties so you'd need to be 1) seriously senior or 2) a devotee of vintage CDs and/or a member of a Film Society specialising in the period to spot the likeness and there's a good chance that even Mara herself is unaware of the likeness. That aside this is, of course, yet another tour de force by the exceptional actress Cate Blanchett who here receives, it must be acknowledged, outstanding support by both Mara and Susan Paulson as Abby.

Harge keeps trying to win Carol back but to no avail. Then one day Carol meets Therese Belivet and is immediately attracted to her. A relationship develops and they fall in love. However, things get complicated when Harge finds out about the relationship and sues for divorce, using the relationship as leverage to win custody of their daughter.Aesthetically pleasing but not very substantial. There's a great style and sensitivity to the film. The fact that the love story is about a lesbian relationship in the 1950s could have been used to turn the movie into something for shock value, or try to go over old ground in terms of social mores, tolerance or civil rights. However, director Todd Haynes steers clear of these obvious detours and pitfalls and makes it into a classy love story. While this is a good thing initially, it doesn't help the movie in the long term. In the end it is pretty much a standard love story, just with the two main characters being women. There's really nothing profound nor special about it.Can't fault the performances though. Cate Blanchett, as Carol, puts in her usual excellent performance, and got a Best Actress Oscar nomination for her efforts. The surprise performance comes from Rooney Mara as Therese. I always thought of her as acting in tough, action-girl sorts of roles (maybe because she starred in the US version of The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo), but here she gives an excellent performance in a dramatic role, showing great vulnerability and range. The performance earned her a Best Supporting Actress Oscar nomination.",Carol

There are no fist fights, back-seat trysts, or mountain scenery in CAROL. Even CAROL's sex scenes are tawdry and tame by BLUE IS THE WARMEST COLOR standards. Of the two fairly Uninvolving characters featured here, the possibly asexual Therese just goes along to get along. She's easy to cook for, eating anything put in front of her. But the younger Therese is the more practical gal in this pairing--the one most likely to know the price of salt, for instance. (However, this flick's second ending, in which Therese seemingly does not know how to quit Carol, seems forced and contrived.) The older title character, on the other hand, apparently never learned from her own mom that a girl's expected to sleep in a bed after she's made it. Carol has bamboozled a Rich Guy with no imagination (please excuse the redundancy) into setting up a home and making a baby together. Then she turns his life into a Living Hell, because she's been swinging from the other side of the plate her entire life. CAROL is a gay version of THE GREAT GATSBY's Daisy Buchanan, plowing through her circle not caring whose life she wrecks.",Carol

There is a morality clause and Carol's lesbian tendencies bring this to bear, especially when she falls for Therese, and a relationship gradually begins to blossom.I was expecting great things from this film: Cate Blanchett as Carol and Rooney Mara as Therese have both been getting glowing notices. And those notices are richly deserved: both women are first rate. I wish I could say the same for the film. There are two strong plot elements here: the legal wrangle and the growing (and forbidden) relationship. The film should have been electrifying. But it is slow and, regrettably, boring. I know that you don't have to take a film at breakneck speed but, given the drama inherent in the two major plot threads, not only does not very much happen, it happens very slowly.I'm sure this will be up for bags of awards (I get the impression that it regards itself as Important), but I was disappointed.",Carol
22,evanston_dad,Todd Haynes Returns to 1950s American Repression,8,23 January 2016,"""Carol,"" the latest film from director Todd Haynes, covers a lot of the same thematic and aesthetic ground covered by Haynes' beautiful 2002 film ""Far from Heaven."" Set in the 1950s, like Haynes' earlier film, and concerning itself with homosexuality, this time female homosexuality, in an era when such a lifestyle was nearly impossible without universal condemnation, it also features exquisite cinematography by Edward Lachmann and a rarefied period glow that makes the film feel more like an artifact from an earlier time than a recent release. If it doesn't have the same emotional wallop as ""Far from Heaven,"" that's partially because it has a happier ending, and also because it feels like less is at stake. ""Far from Heaven"" took on a whole world of prejudice; in fact, the homosexuality of Dennis Quaid's character was accepted more quickly than the interracial romance between Julianne Moore's well-to-do housewife and Dennis Haysbert's working class gardener. In ""Carol,"" Cate Blanchett brings such a determined resolve to the title character that you never worry much about the outcome. If she loses custody of her daughter, which her husband threatens as a way to keep her on a tight leash, you get the sense that she'll be fine anyway. And Rooney Mara's Therese is so young and still discovering herself and the world that you get the sense her affair with Carol is just one of many transformative experiences that will make her the ultimate woman she will become. The two actresses are sensational, Blanchett wafting through the film with an air of regal melancholy and Mara using her large expressive eyes to convey Therese's fear and excitement at entering a forbidden world she didn't even know she wanted until it presented itself to her. It's a film I thoroughly enjoyed, but it has a colder, more insular quality than ""Far from Heaven."" I felt more like I was watching characters in a jar with a detached interest than going through their emotional journeys with them in real time.The film also stars Sarah Paulson as Blanchett's friend and former lover, and though her role isn't large, any movie is made instantly better by her presence, no matter how brief.There was quite a bit of outrage that this film didn't make the final roster of Best Picture candidates at the Academy Awards, but it's not an outrage I share. I admired it but don't think it was Best Picture material.Grade: A",Carol
23,ferguson-6,Unstoppable Attraction,7,26 December 2015,"Greetings again from the darkness. When Patricia Highsmith first wrote her novel ""The Price of Salt"", she had it published in 1952 under a pseudonym (Claire Morgan). This was a sign of the unforgiving social conventions of the era, which also play a key role in the story. At the time, no author would publicly admit to writing a book about lesbian lovers, much less admit their participation in such an affair. Highsmith's novel is the source material for director Todd Haynes' bookend to his stellar 2002 film Far From Heaven. In that film, Dennis Quaid's character struggles with his secret life as a gay man while married to Julianne Moore. In this new movie, Cate Blanchett is a married upper class socialite trying to deal with her true feelings for the opposite sex, while fighting to not lose custody of her young daughter.Haynes has a real feel for attraction  what causes two people to be attracted to each other, and how do they handle it? He re-teams with cinematographer Ed Lachman to create yet another beautiful film with camera work, sets, costumes and a score (Carter Burwell) that complement the romance depicted by the two outstanding lead actresses: Cate Blanchett (Carol) and Rooney Mara (Therese). Ms. Blanchett is a 2-time Oscar winner (5 time nominee), and has become one of the few actors who make each of their films a must-see. She is a true force here as she sweeps into the captivating first sequence (a wonderful long take) and has her first interaction with wide-eyed shopgirl Therese as the two dance together through words and innuendo. It may be the best scene of the movie  at least up to the stunning final shot.At its core, this is a pretty simple romance of two opposite worlds colliding at a time when their attraction was just not tolerated. 1950's social conventions, being what they were, meant Carol's husband (Kyle Chandler) could use her sexual preferences as evidence of immorality in his fight to gain sole custody of their daughter. Cinematically, it's much more about style. Carol is a beautiful mink-wearing work of art, while Therese is seeking her place in the world, while trying to make sense of her feelings. Every scene drips with style  the cars, the clothes, the restaurants; even cigarettes become a fashion accessory between the fingers of Carol.Carol and Therese take a road trip, and it's not until Iowa that the relationship is consummated – a scene that finds neither actress shying away from the moment. Fittingly, this occurs in a motel located in Waterloo  leaving little doubt the turn this story will take.Supporting work is provided by Sarah Paulson (""American Horror Story"") as Carol's friend and ex-lover, Jake Lacey (""The Office"") as Therese's would-be suitor, John Magaro (The Big Short) as her friend and supporter, and Cory Michael Smith (""Gotham"") as a double-life salesman. But this show belongs to Blanchett and Mara. They are terrific together – capturing the unspoken, subtle gestures required by the repressive era they find themselves. Mara's character is difficult to describe, but most intriguing to watch and absolutely vital to the message.Phyllis Nagy adapted Ms. Highsmith's novel (which was re-published in 1990 under her own name), and her care for the material is clear. Todd Haynes then worked his magic with the look of the film, and the two lead actresses deliver a clinic in nuance and dealing with oppression. As it plays, the strength of the film is with the internal struggles faced by the two lead characters. It leaves us to wonder if the film might have been more powerful had it delved a bit deeper into what the characters would have faced from the outside world.",Carol
24,anaconda-40658,Blanchett's Song.,9,8 April 2016,"Carol (2015): Dir: Todd Haynes / Cast: Cate Blanchett, Rooney Mara, Kyle Chandler, Sarah Paulson, Cory Michael Smith: A sad song aimed at those unable to reveal themselves to a society that will not accept them. Cate Blanchett plays Carol who is unhappily married and going through a custody battle over their daughter. Rooney Mara plays Therese, a shop employee whom Carol is enchanted by. Their affection towards each other soon becomes the divider when the custody battle becomes uglier. Tense outside stress intervenes their private moments. Director Todd Haynes dealt with similar themes in Far From Heaven, which deals with characters hiding lifestyles unaccepted by outsiders. Blanchett is mesmerizing sexually taunting Mara while trying to shut out the stress. Mara plays off the innocence of Therese who is dealing with a clingy boyfriend leaving her unable to reveal her true sexuality. They are surrounded by strong supporting players beginning with Kyle Chandler as the controlling ex-husband whose forceful nature has him plotting to keep her daughter away from her. Sarah Paulson is also featured as Carol's best friend Abby who reveals to Therese of their relationship years earlier. Cory Michael Smith appears as a road salesman whose presence carries a double reveal that proves tragic. While not always uplifting the screenplay is detailed with standout performances by the two leads. It regards emotions and feeling that are concealed when society rejects the idea. When a connection is made then everything outside that one holds dear become threatened. Score: 9 / 10",Carol
25,phd_travel,Two of the finest actresses around,7,5 January 2016,"Firstly, this film captures the feel of the 50s in Manhattan with it's art direction and costumes. There was some music from the time but even more use of would have been good. Didn't like the score composed for the film that sounded a bit contemporary.Rooney Mara looks very much like a young Audrey Hepburn with the hair and clothes of that time. She is sweet throughout. Don't understand why she seemed a bit expressionless in the last few crucial scenes when she made up her mind. Cate Blanchett acts quite strong and slightly hard and domineering if not quite predatory. I don't know if it's part of the character but it would have been more sympathetic if she was less self assured at times in this role.The story is involving because the two actresses are so watchable. It isn't that melodramatic by today's standards. To appreciate the drama one has to apply 50s values since the scandal of a lesbian relationship. The impact is lessened with all the same sex couples and modern families today - maybe if it had been made 50 years ago it might have been quite something. The romance evolves gradually. The love scenes were oddly dispassionate.Watch this for the 2 actresses. The story isn't shocking - more of historical interest.",Carol
26,gradyharp,"'I wanna know, I think... I mean, I wanna ask you things, but I'm... I'm not sure that you want that...'",9,31 January 2016,"Todd Haynes has made some solid films (Velvet Goldmine, Far From Heaven, I'm Not There, etc) and he manages to move his cast of characters in this sensitive film based on Patricia Highsmith's 2004 novel 'The Price of Salt' to equal the impact and timing of Highsmith's concept in her novel. Phyllis Nagy adapted the novel for the screen. According to Highsmith's story, Therese (Rooney Mara)is nineteen and working in a department store during the Christmas shopping season. She dates men, although not with real enthusiasm. One day a beautiful older woman comes over to her counter and buys a doll. As the purchase is a C.O.D. order, Therese makes a mental note of the customer's address. She is intrigued and drawn to the woman. Although young, inexperienced and shy, she writes a note to the customer, Carol (Cate Blanchett), and is elated and surprised when Carol invites her to meet. Therese realizes she has strong feelings for Carol, but is unsure of what they represent. Carol, in the process of a bitter separation and divorce, is also quite lonely. Soon the two women begin spending a great deal of time together. Before long, they are madly and hopelessly in love. The path is not easy for them, however. Carol also has a child and a very suspicious husband dangerous ground for the lovers. When the women leave New York and travel west together, they discover the choices they've made to be together will have lasting effects on both their lives. Considered to be the first lesbian pulp novel to break the pulp publishing industry- enforced pattern of tragic consequences for its lesbian heroines, The Price of Salt was written under the pseudonym of Claire Morgan by Patricia Highsmith – the author of 'Strangers on a Train' and 'The Talented Mr. Ripley'. Both Cate Blanchett and Rooney Mara are brilliant in this delicate story. Sarah Paulson adds depth as Carol's previous lover Abby. The flavor of the 1950s is superb as is the cinematography and musical score. The only casting problem is with the men – blustering insensitive performances especially by Kyle Chandler as Carol's husband-on- the-way-out disrupt the flow of the film distractingly. Otherwise it is a triumph for all concerned. Still highly recommended.",Carol

Of course, some sequences, particular in the second-hour, are powerful, but overall, its far from enriching. Phyllis Nagy's Screenplay, based on the novel The Price of Salt (also known as Carol) by Patricia Highsmith, is okay. There was so much potential, but the Writer does not make much use of it. Todd Haynes's Direction is dignified & Edward Lachman's Photography is terrific. Carter Burwell's Score is wonderful, as well.On the whole, 'Carol' has some of the finest performances you'll seen this year, but its not a great film. Nonetheless, go for the acting.",Carol
28,JamesHitchcock,A Lesbian Holiday Affair,7,6 July 2021,"The plot of ""Carol"" owes something to the 1949 film ""Holiday Affair"". Both films are about an assistant in the toy department of a New York store who meets a woman who comes in to buy a train set as a Christmas present for her young child. In both films the two fall in love. The difference is that in ""Holiday Affair"" the shop assistant is male. In ""Carol"" she is female.The shop assistant is Therese Belivet, whose real ambition is to become a photographer. Her lover is Carol Aird, an older married woman who is estranged from her husband and going through divorce proceedings. The action takes place in the early fifties- references in the script to Eisenhower having been elected President but not yet inaugurated allow us to date it to December 1952- a period when lesbian relationships, although not illegal in America, were widely regarded as immoral and socially unacceptable. These social attitudes cause difficulties for Carol, because her oddly-named husband Harge obtains evidence of her relationship with Therese and threatens to use this evidence in their battle for custody of their daughter.The film was directed by Todd Haynes, previously best-known to me as the director of ""Far from Heaven"". That film was also set in the 1950s and also dealt with same-sex affairs, in that case between men, as well as with another subject which would have been controversial in that era, a friendship between a white woman and her black gardener. (That friendship always remains platonic; ""Far from Heaven"" was made in 2002, when Hollywood's attitude towards sexual interracial relationships was still more cautious than it would be today).Both films quite deliberately pay homage to the American melodramas of the fifties, especially the work of Douglas Sirk, while tackling subjects which would have been forbidden to fifties film-makers either by the Production Code or by the force of social disapproval. The title ""Far from Heaven"" clearly alludes to that of Sirk's ""All that Heaven Allows"", and Haynes also pays tribute to Sirk in the very fifties visual style of his film. There is the same lush, romantic soundtrack and a similar use of bright colour. Vibrant primary colours are much in evidence- greens, blues, yellows and especially reds. Like ""All that Heaven Allows"", ""Far from Heaven"" is set in New England during autumn, and photography of the autumnal foliage is much in evidence.""Carol"" is not as colourful as ""Far from Heaven"", and Haynes's style here seems to have been inspired by another Sirk melodrama, ""Written on the Wind"". In both films the backgrounds are generally muted and dominated by greys and browns, but there is generally a prominent, brightly-coloured object in the foreground, normally red or occasionally green. (Blues and purples are little used). Sirk's purpose in using these colours seems to be to provide a sense of artistic unity holding the film together, but Haynes may have wanted to make reference to the time of year when the action takes place, red and green being the colours most associated with Christmas. The heroine's Christian name Carol was taken from the Patricia Highsmith novel ""The Price of Salt"" on which the film is based, but Highsmith might have chosen it as a reference to the Christmas season.The acting is excellent, especially from Cate Blanchett and Rooney Mara as the two main characters, both of whom have divided loyalties. The bisexual Therese has to decide between her feelings for Carol and her existing relationship with her boyfriend Richard. Carol, who is lesbian rather than bisexual but who entered into marriage for the sake of respectability (as many gay women and men did at this period), is torn between her love for Therese and her love for the daughter. She knows that if she renounces Therese and allows her lawyer to argue that her affair was a mental aberration brought on by the stress of the divorce, she might be awarded custody. But is that a sacrifice she is prepared to make?I would not rate the film quite as highly as ""Far from Heaven""; it can at times be too slow-moving, especially during the first half. It is, however, well worth watching as a moving account of the difficulties and prejudices which at one time faced any woman whose only crime was to love another woman. 7/10.",Carol
29,StevePulaski,A colder look into an intimate relationship,6,31 December 2015,"Earlier this year, in my review of ""Me and Earl and the Dying Girl"" specifically, and again in ""Paper Towns,"" I remarked about how a new trend in films was beginning to seriously bother me. That trend was the main character of the film, usually a male teen, remarking about how his story ""wasn't your typical romance"" story or something along those lines. That ploy is such a cheap case of showing rather than telling, or pompously telling the audience something that we would've figured at had we watched the film from start to finish. Perhaps it's only fitting to wrap up 2015's movie-going year with Todd Haynes's ""Carol,"" and, again, point another device in films that's becoming a cliché that I'm getting tired of, as well.That cliché is the long, lingering shots of facial expressions set to pretty obvious orchestration music. It's a device that's purpose is to ostensibly avoid emotional manipulation and provide for simultaneous abstraction of internal thoughts whilst embellishing external reactions and expressions. Some films do it in a way that provokes a lot of thought and naturalism - see ""Christmas, Again"" or even ""Creed"" for a more mainstream example. ""Carol,"" a film that's ultimately a fine work of lesbian cinema, especially by America's standards, is a film that uses it in a way that disconnects from the humanity of the characters in a way that becomes noticeable over the film's two hour runtime.The film is set in the 1950's and revolves around Carol Aird (Cate Blanchett), a woman in the process of divorcing her husband Harge (Kyle Chandler) and enduring a custody battle for her young daughter. One day, Carol looks to purchase a Christmas present for her daughter, and at the department store, she meets Therese Belivet (pronounced ""ther-rezz,"" played by Rooney Mara), a shopgirl who is working there in the meantime to fund her dreams of being a photographer. Carol winds up leaving her gloves on the counter after a brief and amiable conversation with Therese, assuring Therese that this isn't the last time the two will meet.Sure enough, it's not, and the two wind up meeting again. And again. They meet enough to conjure up suspicious on behalf of Harge, who sees their friendship as one that's quickly brewing into a very questionable relationship. We, the audience, see Carol and Therese for who they really are - two women, separated by several years in age, caught in precarious situations that are preventing them from the life they want to lead. Carol's albatross is obviously the prolonged legal proceedings and Harge's demanding and often drunken demeanor, while Therese's is simply the angst of being young and without many opportunities of creativity in a world where expression is limited and money is tight. The two wind up leaning on one another for some semblance of order and stability and, in turn, produce a relationship that is both friendly and respectfully sexual.""Carol"" is a beautifully crafted and well-acted film; the sets and details of the 1950's vehicles, costumes, and malt shops are some of the strongest period sets of the year, sure to snag an Oscar nomination come January. This is also a performance that rests on the strengths of Blanchett, one of the finest female actresses working today, and Mara, who proves that she can hold her own weight, yet again, with a character that isn't so easily defined. Put in frame together, these two actresses, one a veteran and the other well on her way to becoming one, create terrific energy in nearly every scene.""Carol,"" however, ultimately suffers by comparison to ""Blue is the Warmest Color,"" the acclaimed French film that won the Palme d'Or a few years back. That was a film that was raw and real, built from the ground up on human emotions and awkward conversations about relationships and the state of ones feelings. Far too often does Todd Haynes's film and Phyllis Nagy's screenplay settle for abstraction of feelings and lack of character development by trying too hard to create visual poetry by way of Blanchett and Mara's facial expressions, most of which looking uniformly similar throughout the course of the film.When ""Carol"" really pops is during its climax, no pun intended, when the effects of Carol and Therese's relationship begins to become unraveled. Also a really wonderful addition is Nagy's look at how, in a relationship, often one person is incredibly affected by the events, while another is able to move on so easily and not look back. That subtle examination is also what sets ""Carol"" apart from an ordinary romance film, especially one as bleak as this.Haynes and Nagy have crafted a gentle and fairly tame film as far as lesbian films go, which is totally fine; being graphic doesn't mean better, but it often does add a rawer, more unadulterated angle to the film. ""Carol,"" however, plays it safe far too many times to be a fully commendable film; it lacks the kind of character development and real conversational depth it needs to be more than a momentary look into a star-crossed relationship.",Carol
30,blanbrn,A bold and provocative film that proves intimate passion is possible for two of different backgrounds.,8,28 January 2016,"Finally saw ""Carol"" a Todd Haynes directed film which is a strong showcase and focus of a look at two bold female characters and a spotlight of how passion is made despite their different backgrounds. Set in early 1950's a time when most of America was still conservative and a gay loving relationship between two ladies was certainly not the norm, still it happened and this film highlights it in a loving and strong passionate way.Cate Blanchett(in a strong performance)is Carol Aird a proper and rich socialite New Jersey housewife who's on the verge of a divorce and a custody battle. So it's clear that Carol is at a crossroads and needs a new personal adventure so just before one Christmas as Carol takes a shopping trip to New York's Manhattan at a high end department store at the doll section she meets Therese(a speak for herself performance from Rooney Mara)an innocent yet attractive and nice looking clerk that catches the eye and attention of Carol. After this chance meeting the two hook up again to get to know one another better.Slowly but surely the friendship leads to a holiday road travel trip with a lot of conversation and getting to know one another much better occurs. You guessed it the passion and sparks fly with intimate love making as the love scenes are really erotic and bold in a provocative nature. This is a film of more than about love and passion between two women, it's message is that anyone can be a lover with anybody as the time and culture doesn't matter as love and passion should outweigh the norm of society. And love no matter how not the norm is possible for people from two different culture and living backgrounds. Overall ""Carol"" is a statement of love and culture proving that it can happen even in the expected norm of society.",Carol
31,lasttimeisaw,CAROL sweeps with virtuosity as an compelling indictment to a jaundiced society and an ode to the undying strength of love!,9,27 February 2016,"An eight-year gap from his last feature movie I'M NOT THERE (2007), during which he dabbles in the TV sphere to direct a quintessential five-part miniseries MILDRED PIERCE (2011) starring Kate Winslet, Todd Haynes is back in the groove. Adapted from Patricia Highsmith's pioneering novel THE PRICE OF SALT published in 1952 by screenwriter Phyllis Nagy, who wrote the first draft as early as in 1997, CAROL makes headway as the most audacious and empowering addition to the US queer cinema, notably to the rather barren lesbian territory.New York, 1952 , Therese Belivet (Mara), a shop-girl whose real interest is photography, meets Carol Aird (Blanchett), an elegant woman who is experiencing an unpleasant divorce with her possessive husband Harge (Chandler). Therese's presence sheds a light in her life just as hers does in Therese's. Their romance has been intensified through an itinerant journey they embark on during the new year, but the thorny legal procedure to fight the custody of her young daughter forces Carol to unilaterally put their relationship on hold, an ultimate question remains what a downcast Therese will do when a second chance emerges?Predominantly, CAROL is an all-around artistic treasure, the incredible period art production, under the low-key, slightly desaturated tint, precisely reconstructs an alluringly sentimental ambiance of the era to foreground the exquisite undercurrents experienced by Carol and Therese; the sophistication of Carol's gorgeous wardrobe and make-up contrasts the self-revealing honesty and consciousness of Therese's drabber outfits and unadorned countenance; Edward Lachman's breathtaking cinematography is quaintly evocative to reflect Carol and Therese's understated emotional orbits, his sleight-of-hand is at its most potent with those shots behind glasses, immaculately sublimates the blurry equivocation of human's impenetrable sentiments, and the impact multiplies with Carter Burwell's unobtrusive but permeating score.The two leading performances are priceless, it is heartfelt restraint versus enigmatic swank, where the unfathomable attraction burgeons mutually, Mara and Blanchett diligently engage in their two- hander, with minute gestures and body languages and expressional finesse. Blanchett is graceful, alluring, and indecisive, the dramatic soliloquy about her resolution of the custody is beyond question one of the highlights of her illustrious career; whereas Mara is stolid on the surface, watchful and unapologetically true to her feelings, more admirably conveys her true grit against the tentacles of a prejudiced society which reaches into every nook and cranny of her and Carol's lives. In the supporting category, Sarah Paulson as Abby, Carol's confidant, is the ballast of their perilous affair, apart from an awkward former love identity, which could make the mind-game more intriguing if her role were extended.An out-and-out victory from Haynes and his cast, CAROL sweeps with virtuosity as an compelling indictment to a jaundiced society and an ode to the undying strength of love, and beckons a bullish prospect for Haynes' next project, reportedly to be a reunion with another muse Julianne Moore in WONDERSTRUCK, based on the book by Brian Selznick.",Carol

The movie is based on the popular 1952 novel 'The Price of Salt', by Patricia Highsmith. It was directed by Todd Haynes, and scripted by Phyllis Nagy. The film stars Cate Blanchett and Rooney Mara; both were nominated for Oscars, for their performances (Nagy was also nominated for Best Adapted Screenplay). Like most Oscar bait; the movie is extremely slow-paced, but very well made. The story begins in 1952 Manhattan; where Therese Belivet (Mara) works as a clerk, at Frankenberg's. Therese really wants to be a photographer, but her boyfriend, Richard (Jake Lacy), wants her to go to France with him; as well as marry him. Therese is unsure of their relationship. Everything changes when she meets a beautiful older woman, named Carol (Blanchett), at the department store where she works. The two engage in a passionate romance; much to the disappointment of Carol's husband, Harge (Kyle Chandler). Carol and Harge are going through a bitter divorce; which is very hard on their young daughter. It is nice to see a romance (set in 1950s New York) involving two beautiful woman. I'm sure the book was extremely controversial; and ahead of it's time. I admire the movie for being different, and it is very well made.

It's a wonder none of them coughed once or gained weight since that was the bulk of the film. In between those smoking and eating scenes were dry spells of two character drawn to each other for chance coincidence of two women liking other women. As good of actresses as the leads are, I never bought their chemistry or depth other than they both happened to be lesbians.Basically – and that's what this is, basic – two women meet. One rich, the other aimless. One getting divorced, the other clinging onto affection. Suddenly there's a road trip to clear the title character's mind after the thought she might lose custody of her child in the divorce. Forced romance ensues andthe rest is spoilers, albeit obvious.I didn't find the story compelling, or even interesting enough to care about any of the characters. Rooney Mara's Therese, the lost one, spends the grand majority of the film just staring off into nothingness while, I suppose, we're supposed to see depth in her. (Hint: I didn't.) Cate Blanchett's Carol, the richie one, seems to be in another movie, in another room, just reading lines from the script.It would be easy just to call this movie boring and dismiss it. But, it really is that. Barely anything happens and the stuff that does, I've seen countless times before in both gay and straight forbidden love films. Only, those movies had complexity, decent to great cinematography and chemistry between the leadsso we could, you know, root for the forbidden love.Hell, this one was so dry, I was only told the mother, Carol, is heartbroken she can't see her child after the divorce. I never once believed Carol couldn't live without her daughter. She was, again, just reading her lines.Sadly, I don't have much positive to say about this. I wanted to like Blanchett, as I almost always do, but I didn't. I wanted to marvel, once again, at Mara, but she seemed as lost as her character. I did, however, really like the ex-lover character of Abby, played by the wonderful American Horror Story regular, Sarah Paulson. She would be my only vote here for an award nomination. But, even then, I wouldn't be voting for her underused part.I didn't hate this, or even really dislike it that much. I would've had to care more to think that hard on it. It's just a movie I do regret seeing and won't be visiting Carol again.",Carol

35,ElMaruecan82,The curse and blessing of being passive observers...,8,21 July 2017,"""Carol"" is one of the most puzzling romances I saw recently but it's not much a flaw as an insightful reflection of a time where even the proudest representative of the free world couldn't grant its citizens the freedom to express their love, to discover who they are, let alone to experiment it. The film is set in New York City circa Christmas 1952 and while American audiences will probably appreciate the progresses made for human rights, viewers from less tolerant countries will find a powerful parallel between the central relationship and their own struggles.Now, the semantic trap would be to label this very relationship a 'lesbian romance', yes the two women played by Carol Blanchett and Rooney Mara are lesbians but this is not a traditional love story, it's more of a growing friendship culminating with love, a strange attraction that isn't explicitly stated as love or even lust when the eyes of Carol Aird, a glamorous blonde woman in her mid-thirties, meet the shy Therese Belivet, a department store vendor. The two women exchange a few banalities we try to decode, but thankfully, the screenplay written by Phyllis Nagy avoids the obviousness. Therese used to love train sets, but this is less to assert a masculine side than a gift for peculiarity, even her hobbies like photography, if not odd, aren't the most common for a woman in the early 50's.But from their first dialogue, we also gather the information that Carol is a mother, with a little girl, and just when they have nothing else to say, the conversation resumes as if the two women would have wished to make it longer. By the time they meet again in a restaurant, we discover that Carol is divorcing from her husband Harge, a neglectful, domineering but ambiguously loving husband played by Kyle Chandler, and that Therese has a boyfriend who want to marry her. These two women have conventional lifestyles but these are obvious fronts to hide two penchants, one Carol clearly asserted, but Therese is still exploring.And is is very interesting that Therese is a photographer; all through the movie, she's like embodying this hobby by being a passive observer, never opposing any resistance, always available for Carol for any date, at any time. The first encounters aren't passionate enough to pass as love but you can tell Carol is offering little parcels to reach her soul, some bridges of communication Therese never miss. The mutuality of their attraction is so obvious that Carol sees in Therese an angel fallen from the sky, literally too good to be true. The film has the simple maturity of a classic like ""Brief Encounter"" where the text matters less than the subtext and you can literally witness the blossoming of love.Nagy's screenplay is all in finesse and echoes a comment made about the movie ""Sunset Blvd."" the need to see the real message behind the words. I haven't read the original romance ""The Price of Salt"" from Patricia Higsmith (the author of ""Strangers on a Train"" and ""The Talented Mr. Ripley"", more accustomed to the thriller genre) but I can feel that director Todd Haynes really translated the growing complicity in such a way that the body language, the way the two women interact with their eyes, with their tone, cold for Carol, shy for Therese, says more about the forbidden aspect of their love than any explicit contextualization. The innuendos aren't seductive but defensive.The film is set in a time light-years ahead of our Internet and cell-phone driven time where everything is taken for granted. It's these very obstacles that made the relationship grow slowly and patiently, creating an interesting contrast with Golden Palm winner ""Blue is the Warmest Color"" where the two women could get sexual immediately. In ""Carol"", the sex scene is the culmination and it is long enough to celebrate their love and short enough to escape from voyeurism. It is also dramatic as they lowered their guard and proved the husband ""right"" since he raised a clause of morality to get full custody of their daughter, exploiting Carol's relationship with Therese and their daughter's godmother Abby (Sarah Paulson).But the film has a way to deal with the issue without it being a catechism session about human rights; the way Carol deals with her relationship and her divorce shows a level of maturity, lucidity and dignity rarely displayed in a film. ""Carol"" doesn't try to go as far as the plot can take it, on the contrary, it is a sweet and simply told story about a very complex relationship. Anyone can empathize with Carol and Therese and even men aren't portrayed like savage bigots, it's a credit to Todd Haynes to have adopted a neutral point, trusting the maturity of his material and the performances of his actors. Blanchett plays Carol with a dignified authority while Rooney Mara looks genuinely hypnotized by this woman, until we can see some maturity gleaming in her eyes.I was pleasantly surprised by how sober and fluid the film was, featuring an impossible love story in the same vein of intelligence as Brokeback Mountain, and again, calling it a 'lesbian romance' is missing the point, this is a story of forbidden love, heart-warming, touching and with the kind of inspirational ending that severely lack in today's cinema.",Carol
36,paul2001sw-1,Quietly mesmerising,9,22 December 2017,"Todd Haynes' 'Carol', like much of his output, paints a inch-perfect picture of life as it was the 1950s, at least for the middle and upper-middle classes, the sort of protrayal that emphasises the idea that the past is another country and they do things differently there. My gut reaction is to dislike this approach, to feel that a focus on aesthetic differences or behavioural norms hides the essential truth that underneath, we're the same as we always have been. But I can't help but praise 'Carol', a quietly mesmerising movie about two women who have a very socially-unacceptable affair. The acting is good, the score is excellent, but what's really brilliant is that the film works as a portrait of individuals, motivated by their own mixtures of desire and need. This is less a story about the right to be gay, per se, as one about the more general right just to be yourself; but it doesn't shy away from presenting the innate selfishness of asserting that right. I particularly liked the way Cate Blanchett's eponymous character, older and glamourous, initially appears to be calling all the shots, but in fact it's her mousy companion who turns out to have the firmer idea of what she really wants. A subtle and excellent movie.",Carol
37,richardchatten,Still Life,6,17 December 2019,"Acclaimed in a poll organised by the BFI less than six months after it originally opened as the greatest LBGT film of all time. It's ironic that within hours of again watching 'Brief Encounter' I saw the framing scene in the waiting room repeated here as the director, cameraman and costume designer of 'Far from Heaven' were reunited (along with production designer Judy Becker) to cast another revisionist eye on forbidden love in fifties America, with results that resembles a series of characteristically brightly coloured but bleak scenes painted by Edward Hopper.Lipstick lesbians Blanchett and Mara suffer in button-downed elegance, drive about in Mara's fabulous oyster-hued 1949 Packard Super DeLuxe 8, while Blanchett is rarely without a cigarette between her blood red nails (which serves as a sad reminder that author Patricia Highsmith herself later died of lung cancer).",Carol
38,ThomasDrufke,Undeniably Beautiful,7,27 December 2015,"Cate Blanchett is pretty much brilliant in every way. She can pull off any character, in any year, for any film. Rooney Mara is nearing that territory as well. Even in a pretty crappy film, Pan, from earlier this year, Mara is still captivating through a rough script. They are simply two of the best actresses working today, and probably locks to get nominated for Oscars this year as well. Carol isn't anywhere near the best film of the year, but it may have two of the best performances.Blanchett plays Carol, a married mother of a little girl who's in the midst of a divorce and custody issues with her daughter, all because she lives in a time period where having an unwarranted relationship with another person of the same sex is viewed as unnatural. She meets Therese, a department store clerk, and the two engage in a relationship which starts out innocent and turns into something romantic. What I really liked about this film was that everything feels very organic and natural. Nothing with their relationship or even the two woman's other relationships with men feel forced. Carol and her husband go through very real arguments, especially for that time period, and Therese is clearly going through an identity crisis, so the film flows very well as they go through their ups and downsIt's a slow watch and the script is good but it also doesn't contain that one particular scene that Oscar voters usually cling towards. But the performances really drive the script towards possible awards level status. The score done by Carter Burwell helped set the mood of every scene and the cinematography by Edward Lachmann is also absolutely gorgeous and does a great job at setting the 1950's New York scene extremely well. The decision to use Super 16mm film was also a nice touch to give it more of a classy and natural vibe. Aside from its slow pace, there's really nothing wrong with Carol. You go to see these two wonderful actresses perform and they delivered in every way. I don't know if they or the film will win come Oscar season, but both deserve a look.+Undeniable chemistry between leads+Natural relationship+Score+Cinematography-Slow moving7.8/10",Carol
39,lesleyharris30,"Guided by Two Powerful Leads,",8,19 December 2016,"Carol is a great movie with a well developed plot and a terrific cast. It is a slow moving, very character based story as we follow the life of a photographer named Theresa who gains a close relationship with a woman named Carol. The way in which this relationship develops is subtle and well executed by director Todd Haynes, who deserves huge credit for the level of detail he put in to such a straight forward story that he easily could have phoned it.There were, however, several points made by either Theresa or Carol throughout that were never further established. I do not want to give anything away, but you will know when you see it, as intriguing or unusual facts about the characters are discovered and we never hear any more from it. It was probably further established in the novel, but as an audience member I found myself wanting to know more.Huge credit is also due to Rooney Mara and Cate Blanchett, who deliver powerful, personal and engaging performances, their chemistry together was outstanding. They did not seem in any way intimidated by these challenging roles, they were not afraid to be daring. It is a slow moving film and not very much actually happens, but that is the beauty of it, we are merely following a brief period in these two ladies' lives. Beautifully directed and well acted, I would recommend Carol to anyone looking for a good drama. An aspiring photographer begins a friendship with a woman named Carol, one that becomes more intimate as they get to know each other. Best Performance: Cate Blanchett",Carol

Rooney Mara should have been on the lead role list, while Cate Blanchett in the supporting character's. Maybe the Academy people misunderstood that the title role must be the lead character. Theirs switched place actually does not make any sense. Anyway the Oscars never made sense at all.This story was okay, but adapted screenplay and direction, especially the music was excellent. For the ending scene alone, you will be tempted to raise your rating than what you initially thought it deserves. I was not expecting the movie to be awesome, so I'm not upset for the overall movie.Believe me, the last thing I want in this movie is to see Cate Blanchett in naked. Maybe out of respect or her age or she's not attracted to me, there are plenty of reasons that I can't figure it out which one, but after knowing what this theme is, I was only praying for that not to happen. And obviously that is unavoidable, otherwise the movie will lose its soul and strength.Well, it was better than I thought, both the actresses were good, but Rooney Mara dominated. Whatever category she's in for the Oscars, I'll be happy if she wins. It is not a must watch, but a decent movie and betters in some parts.7/10",Carol
45,sol-,Looks and Stares,8,3 December 2017,"Romance blossoms between a wealthy, middle aged woman and an open-minded younger woman in this lusciously filmed drama set during the 1950s. While both Cate Blanchett and Rooney Mara are effective in their respective roles, the most interesting aspect of 'Carol' is the near ignorance of everyone else to the possibility of the pair being in love. More than half an hour passes before Blanchett's husband questions how Mara knows her and director Todd Haynes does wonders keeping the mutual attraction between the pair subtle. Much is communicated simply through looks and stares without the need for explicit romantic moments or obvious dialogue. This subdued approach in turns makes Blanchett's more emotional moments in the second half of the film more powerful as she comes against a ""morality clause"" in her impending divorce proceedings. Certain aspects of both female protagonists are left uncomfortably murky - most notably, the suggestion that Blanchett might have a history of seducing younger women. Both characters are generally well fleshed out though as they are torn between the hearts' desires and being what everyone else expects them to be. Carter Burwell provides an enchanting music score that perfectly complements the proceedings and the memorable final scene is a testament to the ability of images to convey more than words.",Carol
46,Red-125,Todd Haynes loves to film Rooney Mara,8,5 January 2016,"Carol (2015) was directed by Todd Haynes. It stars Cate Blanchett as Carol Aird, a wealthy, married woman, and Rooney Mara as Therese Belivet, a young, inexperienced department store clerk. The film is set in late 1952 and 1953.The two women meet when Carol comes into a department store to find a special doll as a Christmas present for her daughter. Because the doll is unavailable, Therese suggests a Lionel train instead. The relationship begins there, but it doesn't stop there. For some movies, the reviewer can travel deep into the plot, but not for this one. As the relationship between Carol and Therese develops, the story moves in interesting and unpredictable ways. It's better if you see the movie, and find out what happens, rather than just reading about it in a review.Cate Blanchett, at 45, is one of the most beautiful women on the screen today. However, for some reason, in this film she looks almost dowdy. Granted, some of the fashions worn in 1952 look dowdy to us now, but I think the problem is deeper than that.Director Haynes is clearly fascinated by Rooney Mara's appearance. (To paraphrase, ""She's OK if you like talented, slender women with large eyes and impossible cheekbones."") Haynes simply can't keep the camera off her. We see her face in closeup, middle distance, and long distance. We see it through house windows and car windows (with and without streaks of rain), and mirrors. She's Audrey Hepburn for the 21st Century.The film is called ""Carol,"" but it should be called ""Therese,"" because Mara is the centerpiece of the movie. It's not fair to Cate Blanchett, but that's show business. Blanchett, as Executive Producer as well as star, probably could have pushed Haynes to move matters in a different direction. However, the film we see has Mara as the star. You'll have to decide whether that's good news or bad news.Incidentally, Haynes insists that we know the period in which the film is set. We get endless shots of men in fedoras, everyone smoking, dial telephones, phone booths, and period automobiles. We even hear Eisenhower's 1953 inaugural address playing on the radio. OK--got it. It's the fifties. The purpose of all this--I assume--is not nostalgia. It's making sure that we realize that what was thought abnormal then would not be seen as abnormal today. If everything were fine, there'd be no plot.We saw this movie at the excellent Little Theatre in Rochester, NY. It will work equally well on the small screen. It's definitely worth seeking out and watching.Extra stuff about Lionel trains: when Therese suggests an electric train for Carol's daughter, she certainly sent her in the right direction from today's perspective. However, that suggestion would have been unusual--almost bizarre--in 1952. In 1952, girls wanted trains, but their mothers wouldn't buy them. Boys got trains, girls got dolls.Going beyond that, when Therese suggested the specific Lionel set for the little girl, she selected a beauty. It was Lionel's #2190W Santa Fe Super Speedliner. Therese tells Carol that this was a limited edition, made especially for the store. That's possible too, because the store in which Carol works could be a stand-in for Macy's, and Macy's did have special Lionel sets that were only available in the store. If you want to see what the set looked like, here's a YouTube link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEHObP2U4TY You'll be impressed.",Carol
47,leonblackwood,Overrated but emotional in parts! 4/10,4,28 March 2016,"Review: This is another one of those overrated movies which I didn't really enjoy! The acting is superb from Cate Blanchett, (Carol), and the whole look and feel of the film is well put together but the storyline was extremely boring. I was intrigued with Carol, who had a sketchy past, which never comes to light but Therese (Rooney Mara), seemed a bit dead to me. She doesn't really come out of her shell throughout the whole movie, even when Carol goes missing and leaves her in the hotel room with her friend, and the ending was pretty weak. As I'm not one for period dramas, I did go into this movie with an open mind, after reading all of the great reviews but I really couldn't get into the love story between Carol and Therese. I liked the concept about Carol losing her child, with her husband spying on her, whilst trying to get back with her but I struggled to keep awake through the rest of the film. The question that never got answered was; Is Carol a lesbian or not? She obviously loved Therese, in her own type of way but as she said in the letter that she wrote to her, she was a young gullible girl who really needed to grow up. Anyway, the pace of the film is really slow and there isn't enough material to keep the movie interesting. Blanchett was definitely the perfect choice for the leading role and I did feel a sense of intensity at some points of the film but for a 2 hour movie, there wasn't much depth to the characters and the love story takes ages to get going. Disappointing!Round-Up: Surprisingly enough, this movie was up for 6 Academy awards and 5 Golden Globes but it didn't win, in any of the categories. Understandably, Cate Blanchett was up for best actress in a leading role, which she lost out to Brie Larson in Room but she has 2 Oscars already, for the Aviator and Blue Jasmine. Anyway, Carol was actually a real person called Virginia Kent Catherwood, who had an affair with an author called Patricia Highsmith, and lost custody of her daughter after her homosexuality was used against her with a tape recording of a lesbian liaison she had in a hotel room, so there is some truth to the storyline. The movie was directed by Todd Haynes, 55, who brought you Safe in 1995, Velvet Goldmine, Far From Heaven and the warped I'm Not There, which also starred Cate Blanchett, dressed up at Bob Dylan. Although this movie went down well with critics, I failed to get the moral of the story and it seemed like it was going round and round in circles. Budget: $12million Worldwide Gross: $40millionI recommend this movie to people who are into their romance/dramas starring Cate Blanchett, Rooney Mara, Kyle Chandler, Jake Lacy, Sarah Paulson and John Magaro. 4/10",Carol
48,matthewssilverhammer,Most Over-Rated Film of 2015,5,23 January 2016,"Carol is complicated. Outwardly, it's a retro-drama about forbidden love between two women in the 1950s. Underneath, it's looking at the more complex and intriguing world of human connection. It's sexy yet proper; it's delicate yet strong; it's romantic yet haunting; a picturesquely shot period-piece that stuns with its beauty, both visually and aurally (the score is mesmerizing). So with all the technical perfection, why did I find it to be the most critically overrated movie of 2015? Despite its unendingly admirable skill, it left me unsatisfied and, worse yet, emotionally confused. Mara plays a naïve young woman spellbound and emotionally seduced by Blanchett's broken and mesmerizing Carol, a woman who seems to have a ""There's-Something-About-Carol""-esque effect on everyone she meets. Both actresses are as phenomenal as you've probably heard, but our relationship to them is nearly as frustrating as their relationship is to each other. In a terribly confused bit of story framing, we meet them at the end of their relationship before going back to the beginning, as we watch the sheepishly sweet Mara get emotionally destroyed by the almost predatory Blanchett. This would be fine, except the movie itself doesn't seem to be wrongly convinced that Carol is ultimately a ""good"" person, giving her too many chances to plead her selfish case. Herein lies the complication: despite these flaws, it's a visually gorgeous and thematically interesting film. Director Haynes creates a hazy atmosphere in his perfect Christmas setting, highlighting the similarities between its titular character and the holiday season's preposterous promises. Unfortunately these noble positives couldn't mask my overwhelming sense that Carol was less-than-noble in its own messaging.",Carol
49,Movie_Muse_Reviews,"A filmmaking vision beautifully realized, ""Carol"" is an enthralling romantic drama",9,26 January 2017,"A love story set in 1950s New York, ""Carol"" has a grace and elegance about it that all great period romances possess, but as a love story between two women in the 1950s, a small but powerful dramatic bent elevates ""Carol"" beyond genre and beyond being labeled ""an LGBT film.""Story aside, ""Carol"" stands on a powerful foundation of artistic vision, production and performance. Todd Haynes (""I'm Not There,"" ""Far From Heaven"") was criminally denied an Oscar nomination for guiding this vibrantly realized recreation of the '50s that works from the outside in, setting the stage for knockout performances from Cate Blanchett and Rooney Mara.Although Blanchett is the tour-de-force playing the title character, the film is from the perspective of Mara's Therese, a young 20- something trying to navigate her big city life of a department store job and host of male suitors who becomes instantly intoxicated by Carol, a woman who comes into the store looking for a Christmas gift. From there begins this low-heat, smoldering romance that builds gradually throughout the film. The complication is that Carol is in the process of divorcing her husband (Kyle Chandler) and he's making things difficult for her and her relationship with their young daughter.Adapted by Phyllis Nagy from the Patricia Highsmith's novel ""The Price of Salt"" about Highsmith's affair with an older woman, ""Carol"" has elements of that deeply personal memoir feel. By focusing on Therese, Carol remains a bit more of the alluring enigma, a woman of wealth and elegance who seems to be something else entirely, whereas Therese is meek, impressionable and discovering who she is.Their discrepancies and the time they live in come most alive in Sandy Powell's costume design, with Therese's thrifty, vintage look compared to Carol's fur coats. Blanchett is always so enchanting to watch, so it's almost unfair that her character is arrayed in elegance. Again, all the elements – the costumes, the direction and the actress all come together in total harmony, drawing us into the story completely and most importantly, allowing us to see Therese's experience with the feelings that she experiences.Haynes' touch – and I use that word purposefully – is gentle and poised. His camera lingers as it needs to and calls attention to the powerful chemistry between the leads. We feel their every glance and touch, and while these characters' attraction to each other is palpable, Blanchett and Mara's reactions hit the sweet spot between obvious and subtle. The sexual tension mounts gracefully and Carter Burwell's score seems to perfectly accent every emotion.Fans of romance films, straight or gay, will be completely swept up in this affair, though the script never plays it up for purposes of entertainment. The execution is just so spot-on that the romance becomes as if not more compelling than the drama surrounding it. Some viewers will undoubtedly want more of the LGBT rights history component, but Nagy clearly hasn't written a historical film, she just wants to show how the romance – the core of her story – was affected by views on homosexuality at the time. Even deeper, ""Carol"" is more about identity than love, and how desire should shape our choices, even when our logic – and society – tells us otherwise.~Steven CThanks for reading!

As the movie opens, we see Carol and Therese having a coffee or tea in a posh hotel lobby. By happenstance, one of Therese's friends is there to meet someone too but comes over to say hello to Therese. Before we know it, Carol makes a hasty departure. Then we go back in time as we see how Carol and Therese meet in the toy department of a large department store. To tell you more would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: this is the latest movie from Todd Haynes, whose previous movie was the Bob Dylan interpretation ""I'm Not There"" (also co-starring Cate Blanchett. Here he tackles the big screen adaptation of the 1952 Patricia Highsmith novel The Salt of Price (originally published under the pseudonym Claire Morgan). Deemed too hot for the 1950s, the book was quickly dismissed and forgotten by the public at large, until it was rescued from oblivion and reissued in the early 90s. A story like this stands and falls with the lead performances, and Haynes has absolutely struck gold with both Blanchett and Mara. The Performance from Cate Blanchett (who played another impressive role in ""Truth"" just last month) is the more obvious one (has she ever looked more glamorous than this?), but Mara displays a vulnerability seldom seen and which will tug at your heart, and then some. If there is movie justice, they will both receive multiple nominations in the upcoming awards season.I'd be remiss if I didn't point out that the entire movie was shot in and around Cincinnati (including also Hamilton and Lebanon) in March-April 2014. For those of us living here, it was a lot of fun to pick out what parts of Cincinnati appeared in what scenes. (As a complete aside, my daughter ended up serving lunch one day to Blanchett, who could be seen frequently in and around downtown restaurants during the film's shoot. Apparently Blanchett couldn't have been nicer, and she left a very generous tip for my daughter.) The movie opened on two screens at my local art-house theater here in Cincinnati at Christmas, and the matinée screening where I saw this at today was absolutely PACKED, I am happy to report. Given the positive buzz that this movie is creating, and assuming great word-of-mouth and some Oscar nominations, this movie may very well build into a bona fide hit on the art-house theater circuit.

Also like what Kyle Chandler of Friday Night lights fame was doing in this flick as a husband trying so desperately to hold on to something he never really had.The movie examines relationships on so many levels, and I just found it wonderfully done.

52,jtindahouse,Didn't get me to buy in,5,23 February 2016,"For me the greatest love stories don't have a difference, they have chemistry. Just having the couple in your movie be lesbian women doesn't necessarily make them interesting. That's what holds 'Carol' back for me. Not enough time and effort is actually put into making us believe and care for the lead character's relationship, we are just simply supposed to accept it. Cate Blanchett and Rooney Mara have been nominated for Academy Awards for Best Actress and and Best Supporting Actress respectively. They never blew me away and I suspect it was more a case of getting the nod for going out of their comfort zones. They can say they felt they had great chemistry all they want, but what came across in the finished product speaks for itself. I suspect the Academy is smart enough to see this and consequently neither will get the win.There was a little bit of an uproar when the nominations were announced that 'Carol' hadn't been given a Best PIcture nod. To the people upset I would ask what exactly did it do to separate itself from every other film of 2015? Be about lesbians, would be about the only convincing answer I would accept. Is that enough to get you a nod? I would hope not. It's not really a bad film, it just comes across run of the mill and forgettable. The best love stories leave you caring about the future of the relationship. For these two, I couldn't have cared less.",Carol
53,Turfseer,"Masterful cinematography, bravura acting and classic production design can't save old hat tale of lesbian romance",5,15 January 2016,"Unlike the sentimental melodrama ""Brooklyn,"" Director Todd Haynes has fashioned a more salacious tale based on Patricia Highsmith's 1952 novel ""The Price of Salt"" (later named ""Carol""). Like his predecessor, Douglas Sirk, the grandmaster of the 1950s melodrama, you can always count on Haynes to deliver the goods in terms of brilliant cinematography, bravura acting (this time provided by Cate Blanchett and Rooney Mara) as well as a production design that magnificently recreates the heady days of the early 1950s, just as Dwight D. Eisenhower ascends the ""throne"" of the American presidency for the first time. Despite all the positives, why then is ""Carol"" simply ""average"" and mediocre to boot?When Highsmith's novel came out in 1952, a lesbian romance was considered fairly scandalous. Indeed, when the film's protagonist, Carol Aird, begins a lesbian affair with salesgirl Therese Belivet, the villain of the piece, Carol's rather mean and pathetic husband, Harge, invokes a ""morality clause,"" permitting him to gain full custody of the couple's young daughter, Rindy, without the possibility of Carol having any visitation rights. Carol's ensuing decision to get away from it all and inviting Therese on a sensual whirlwind of a cross country car trip may have been shocking for 1950s readers, but today it feels like old hat. We're supposed to get excited about the two lovers' intense desire for one another but what's so original about a lesbian romance? It's simply not enough on which to hang your hat on for an entire movie. True, at the midpoint, there is a welcome plot twist involving Harge, who hires a private investigator to tape record Carol and Therese as they make love in the ""presidential suite"" of a cheap motel. But what happens after that? Spoilers AHEAD. Carol goes back to Harge but eventually (wouldn't you know it?) is unable to shake her love and lust for dear Therese, and it's postulated at the climax that indeed they will once again reunite. The uncreative ending -- which really needed some kind of extraordinary twist -- leaves the two lovers staring at one another in a fancy hotel restaurant, as the screen fades to black. I suppose the non-stop ""passion"" between the two principals is what has seduced both critics and the average film-goer alike into declaring that this is some kind of masterpiece. But in reality Mr. Haynes should be applauded only for creating an impressive atmosphere— mere attraction (no matter how intense it is), is not enough for us to care about characters that are in need of much more detailed development.",Carol
54,meeza,Sweeet Carol!,8,15 January 2016,"Writer-Director Todd Haynes film ""Carol"" is not filled with carols of joy, but works very effectively. It centers on a lesbian relationship set in 1950's New York between a chain-smoking socialite named (see title of movie) and a shy shopgirl named Therese. As many of Haynes movies, it has that cinematic aura of the golden era of Hollywood; which he puts his Haynes on for. The character Carol, genuinely played by the great Cate Blanchett, is going through the first phases of a divorce from her alcoholic & abusive husband Harge; and yes, Harge was a bit harsh on Carol. Carol then unexpectedly meets Therese at the department store where Therese works at, and an instant connection develops that consequently develops into a gradual unification. Rooney Mara was astounding as Therese and is very worthy of her Best Supporting Actress nomination; even though ""Carol"" should have really been titled ""Therese"", you get my Therese thrift? Chandler (who is a profoundly underrated) was strong as Harge in his supporting performance. Carter Burwell's soothing score was the best I have heard in a motion picture this year; score that one for an Oscar win in my book. ""Carol"" does move a bit slow (in more ways than one) so please be patient with it, but at the end I am sure you will enjoy the ""Carol"". **** Good",Carol
55,iquine,Incredibly Acted & Poetically Shot,9,4 October 2018,"(Flash Review)Taking place in the 50s, this is a picturesque and poetic romantic tale about an unconventional love for the era. An older and sophisticated woman is drawn to a younger shop clerk. Both from different backgrounds and classes, an attraction is lit. There is a slow and subtle build to their emotions artistically presented by their expressions, gestures, innuendo and careful shot framing. There is also a dominant vs naivety dynamic that is a key for the two getting to know each other. As they deal with various hurdles in their lives, they do their best to tune out the world around them. How will emotions and society steer their romance or crush it? Structurally and artistically, this is how films should take advantage of the medium of film! Textural shots are peppered in while complimented by great period music, styles, colors and décor help to tell the story. Blanchett and Mara completely become the characters and ace the emotions from subtle to boisterous perfectly.",Carol
56,smatysia,Worth checking out,7,23 February 2017,"I enjoyed this movie, even though not much really happens in it. That is OK. There is definitely a place in cinema for character studies. You can call it a drama, but I'm not sure you could call it a psychological drama. Mara Rooney is a bit inscrutable as a mousy early Fifties single girl. You can say the same for Cate Blanchett, as the older (39-ish?) wealthy society lady. I doubt that it is giving much away to say that they fall for one another. Blanchett's character, Carol, has a lesbian relationship in her past, so it brings up the question ""Is she preying on the 21 year old Therese?"" (Rooney). It doesn't truly seem so from here. The performances seemed good to me, and the film has good photography, direction, and authentic-to-the-times costumes. If you don't require car chases and explosions in a movie, check it out.",Carol

Rooney Mara (who is a dead ringer for Audrey Hepburn) also does a fantastic job in this film. This a scrumptious, gorgeously mounted film with several fine performances. The production values are first-rate and the material covered is done with great sensitivity and passion. I also appreciated the fine flashback technique used by the screenwriter. The film highlights the impossible task of both women, and I would assume men in the same situation, who must be true to their hearts, when society, at this point in time (1953), did not have a clue about the needs of the LGBTQ+ community. A film for all sexes and preferences, because beautiful love stories are hard to find for any community.",Carol

Despite the cold color palette and understated drama, Cate Blanchett and Rooney Mara have excellent, warm chemistry between one another.A lot of other viewers have complained about the deliberate pacing, but I thought it suited the movie's almost-dreamlike tone. The pacing, themes, and visuals reminded me a lot of Douglas Sirk movies. In fact, he movie is very similar to the director's earlier FAR FROM HEAVEN, a more direct homage to Sirk with its depiction of suffocating suburbia and forbidden love; however, I found CAROL much more involving and less on the nose with its social commentary. I have little doubt this will become a classic in the years to come.",Carol
59,davispittman,Fabulous performances by Blanchett and Mara,8,12 April 2017,"Carol (2015) starring Cate Blanchett, Rooney Mara, and Sarah Paulson really is all about the established cast and their wonderful performances. Cate Blanchett, one of my favorite actresses, really shows what she can do in this 1950s story about a lesbian relationship. Blanchett plays Carol Aird, a woman who is the mother of a young girl and is going through a divorce with her soon to be ex husband Harge Aird. Rooney Mara plays Therese Belivet, a young aspiring photographer in her 20s. They meet at a department store where Therese works and Carol is buying a Christmas gift for her daughter. The two of them sense an attraction almost instantly and a close bond starts to form between them. Soon that bond turns romantic and because of the society they live in, they both face harsh consequences. Like I've stated, the acting is marvelous, and the writing is good too. The script gives great depth to the all the characters. It digs deep into Carol and Therese's relationship. I love that about the movie because we as the audience must see all of who these characters are and be able to feel for them and understand the garbage that the society in the 1950s drug them through. The imagery used in the film is breathtaking throughout. I adored the cinematography and the costume design. They all deserved major award nominations if not wins, and the academy did award Carol 6 nominations. I give Carol an 8/10 and suggest it to any and all.",Carol

62,aharmas,The Power of Love,10,12 December 2015,"How can a movie go wrong with Cate Blanchett for its lead? and is it possible that Rodney Mara is as good as her costar? You can decide that when you see the very dramatic, moving, artistic, and quite spectacular account of a forbidden love a few decades ago in New York City. Todd Haynes surpasses his ""Far From Heaven"" and ""Mildred Pierce"", two projects that were visually impressive and impeccably directed. He has put together a movie that evokes the past, gets inside the lives and emotions of two women and to a limited extent those close to them to give us a look into a society that has long gone. Hasn't it?Carol is an unhappy housewife, a strong woman who feels trapped because she's not able to live her life freely. She has everything anyone could wish for: a beautiful daughter, a rich husband who loves her, friends, but her life is empty until she runs into Therese, and everything becomes more complicated. Carol knows what she likes and wants. Therese has needs, yearnings, her own anxiety and sadness, which keeps her from realizing her professional and personal goals. Suddenly she finds herself more alive and more confused than ever.As their emotions begin to overwhelm them, we learn the background in Carol's life. Her marriage is collapsing because of one earlier indiscretion. Society doesn't know how to deal with the situation, and her husband is looking for solutions, lashing and demanding, hurting everyone along the way.Eventually, everything reaches an emotional climax, and we can expect consequences will be irreversible and devastating for all involved. ""Carol"" presents personal, intimate moments which explore the relationship between the two leads. It dedicates enough time to a few of the supporting characters so we understand their perspective on things. It's a more innocent world, but it's no less cruel than what we deal with nowadays. Society doesn't forgive, and soon, lawyers are involved.There's a powerful scene that shows ""Carol"" is about to fall into the worst imaginable situation. Incredibly, things develop into a much different way, and at this time, we get to see that the story takes a couple of unexpected turns. It becomes very realistic, and it reaches out to the audience so that we become invested in its eventual resolution. The script is tight, giving us essential points, strong development, and not wasting time. It is a story with a powerful story, real, touching characters, and as I mentioned before in the hands of the magnificent cast, it's almost a perfect movie.Many will love the way the past is brought back to life, with much beauty and care, a great score, much attention to the look and feel of a time that has left for the most part, but that shares plenty of emotions with our contemporary world.",Carol
63,jadepietro,The Price of Love,10,16 January 2016,"(Rating: ☆☆☆☆ out of 4)This film is highly recommended. In brief: A film so sensitive and emotionally satisfying with wonderful direction and superb production values.GRADE: A-The lesbian romance film, Carol, shows the world as it was, brimming with homophobia and societal proprieties. It grips the moviegoer from the start, with a scene that bookends its narrative and does a complete 180 degrees in its brilliant use of flashback. This is one of director Todd Haynes' finest films, one that should not be missed. (That this film did not merit an Oscar nomination for its director and the film itself is a travesty.) ￼It's the Fifties, 1952 to be exact, a time when love could only be seen between the opposite sex and repression was the ultimate means of survival. Carol tells its tale so well, with a sensitivity toward its subject and a stylish flair that shies away from the full-blown soap opera aspects of the story: Two women share a secret passionate relationship and the complications they faced in the real world change their lives. The film is staggering in its solitude and nuanced in its superb acting by its two leads.Through a chance meeting, Therese (Rooney Mara), a saleswoman encounters a new customer, Carol (Cate Blanchett). She is suddenly quite taken by this beautiful socialite and the attraction is mutual yet mysterious to both women. Carol lives alone but has a loving boyfriend, Richard, while Carol is lost in an unhappy marriage to Harge and devoted to her young child. Their lives entangle as their romance begins to grow. But love, unfortunately, has its bounds.￼The artful vision of Todd Haynes crafts a film brimming with repressed passion...a cautious look, a somewhat lingering touch, whispered conversations. He fills the screen with images that evoke that era as he focuses on the women caught in a man's world and the repercussions that their affair will undermine. The melodramatic elements are still there but everything is handled so subtly and honestly that one is swept into the emotional dilemmas of the film's well-defined characters. Both the director and Phyllis Nagy's screenplay, based on Patricia Highsmith's 1952 novel, The Price of Salt, downplay the theatrics and bring a modernistic sensibility to this literate adaptation.￼The acting is excellent. Ms. Blanchett, channeling the icy sophistication of Grace Kelly, plays the title character and hides the vulnerability and anger seething beneath the surface. Her heightened composure, demure manner, and classic wardrobe serve to camouflage the fear and hurt from years of perpetuating a lie that brought her wealth and motherhood. Ms. Mara, resembling a young waif-like Audrey Hepburn, shows her character's impetuousness and eagerness to confront her own inhibitions in such a convincing way. Their chemistry is palpable and each actress conveys the multitude of emotions that emerge from these oppressed times. Fine support also comes from its fine cast: Sarah Paulson, Cory Michael Smith, Jake Lacy, and especially Kyle Chandler as Carol's brutish spouse.￼Special mentions go out to the artisans behind the camera as well: Ed Lachman's camera-work captures a bygone era with his golden tones and pastel palette, production design by Judy Becker hones in on the period details, Sandy Powell's costumes bring that style and elegance to the forefront, and Carter Burwell's lovely melancholy score adds layers to the moody atmosphere of the film. ￼Carol is superior filmmaking and one of the year's best films.Visit my blog at: www.dearmoviegoer.comANY COMMENTS: Please contact me at: jadepietro@rcn.com",Carol
64,Sergeant_Tibbs,Achingly tender romance about how love is a part of the human condition.,8,31 October 2015,"It's an inevitability that Carol will face categorisation as an LGBT film, but that's not the limits of how it should be considered. It's simply a heartfelt and deeply human love story where the principle couple confronts insurmountable odds. In Carol's case, these obstacles are the prejudices of the time and culture they live in. The film frames this discrimination in a tangible and legal way, as the titular Carol is accused of a morally indecent lifestyle by her ex-husband in order to win custody of their daughter. The film isn't interested in being a courtroom drama though, instead focusing on the blossoming relationship between Rooney Mara's Therese and Cate Blanchett's Carol. Todd Haynes is known for his heightened style that evokes the melodrama of Douglas Sirk, for instance. His 2002 film Far From Heaven feels plucked from the cinema of the 1950s. However, Carol is a film that feels plucked from the New York streets of the 1950s as the aesthetic here is surprisingly naturalistic. It doesn't quite breach a documentary-esque style with Edward Lachman's understated and pleasantly grainy cinematography, but it all comes organically and authentically with the elegant fashion of production and costume design and the atmosphere that its cold Christmas setting provides. It's a very restrained film – as there are only two particularly intimate scenes – but the film carries an air of sexual and romantic tension throughout. As Carol, Cate Blanchett challenges her polar opposite and equally excellent work with Haynes as a Bob Dylan incarnation in I'm Not There here. By nature of the film's structure, the first half is in the perspective of Therese and the second focuses on the perspective of Carol. There's an interesting inaccessibility about Blanchett in the first half that draws you into Therese's infatuation. Mara, one of the most promising actresses of this decade since her small memorable part in The Social Network, uses her own reserved detachness – something she's been frequently criticised for – to her own advantage. To watch someone like Therese open up after being so repressed is thoroughly cathartic. However, Blanchett whips the film from under her feet in the second half. She litters the first half of the film with nuanced hints and clues to her past desires, also communicating so much with very little. She's elusive, but Mara is a key source of intrigue at that point due to the honesty in her performance and unexpected dry wit. Once Carol is struggling to deal with her own internal conflicts, Blanchett is on fire and burns the house down with her ultimate rebuttal of the accusations against her. Kyle Chandler, her suffering husband soon to be ex-husband, shows such painful anguish in his brief outbursts. It's a measured performance that anchors the film and the stakes of the relationships. Every performance of the ensemble – from extras to bit parts – are delivering among their finest work. It's an all-rounder in terms of Oscar-contention, with Haynes perhaps being a more likely bet for Best Director than the film is for Best Picture. Blanchett has won too recently but if Weinstein works his magic, Mara would be a strong contender in either leading or supporting. Phyllis Nagy will certainly duel with Aaron Sorkin in Best Adapted Screenplay, even if her work is more patient, while the production and costume design ought to destroy competition. A sure bet should be Carter Burwell for his beautiful score that sunk my chest with its few powerful notes. It's an achingly tender film that will be timeless, even if it doesn't resonate with everyone with such specificity. Carol shouldn't just be a statement for our time and a condemnation for past mistakes, it's a demonstration that love is a part of the human condition regardless of sexuality. 8/10",Carol
65,xmasdaybaby1966,intense passionate thriller,9,28 February 2016,"I really enjoyed how the first scene interlinks with the closing of the film- like something from The Sixth Sense; Brief Encounter or a Hitchcock classic.Despite being set over 60 years ago, it is modern in the sense of having leading female actors and men only being the support.The slow and intense build up leaves you on the edge of the seat and the nigh on 2 hour long film passed by in no time.I am not sure why the film was named Carol as it was Cate Blanchett's character was not really the star of the film but obviously she was the better known actress but both played their roles so very well.A must see- even we heterosexual blokes will enjoy it",Carol
66,tomsview,When a woman meets a woman,8,22 November 2016,"This is why we have awards for acting.Although I approached ""Carol"" as a straight guy, the story of two people finding a fulfilling relationship despite powerful social pressures - in this case those of the early 1950's - resonates far and wide. Gender preferences aside, it's a dilemma older than ""Romeo and Juliet"".Carol (Cate Blanchett), is married with a child and has long accepted her sexual attraction to other women. Her marriage is just about finished, but she risks losing custody of her daughter. The younger woman, Therese (Rooney Mara), isn't so sure of her sexuality, but is withdrawing from her relationships with men.At first I thought Carol seemed rather predatory and was grooming the younger woman. However when Therese goes on a trip with Carol you realise that something suppressed has been released within her; she actually initiates taking the relationship to a physical level.Cate Blanchett is more low-key than she was in ""Blue Jasmine"", she can change gears from film to film. That is also true of Rooney Mara, she is an actor you can't help but notice.This is a brave performance from someone who tackles one challenging role after another; just look at ""Girl with the Dragon Tattoo"" and ""Side Effects"". I first remember her in the very funny ""Youth in Revolt"". In ""Carol', her character's calm, compliant demeanour masks conflicted emotions.The 50's setting inspired director Todd Haynes to give the film a desaturated, grainy texture with a few dominant colours. The inspiration was apparently the photography of Saul Leiter, but it actually captured the look of many 1950's movies, especially those shot on the soundstage. If films back then weren't shot in black and white, they often had a bluish or greyish decor to suit lighting and colour limitations.But besides capturing the look, the film also captures the moral tone. I grew up in the 50s and issues seemed a lot more black and white back then - surface conformity was the norm even if it meant an unhappy marriage.The film has an unexpected ending and neither of the women has to feel the guilt or face the punishment that Shirley McLean's character did after fancying Audrey Hepburn's in ""The Children's Hour"" back in 1961.There are no villains in ""Carol"", although the men in the film don't exactly shine. However, in an era where same sex marriage is widely accepted, this film shows the difference 60 years can make.",Carol
67,wisewebwoman,Oddly Lifeless,3,22 January 2018,"For a film about the ""love that dare not speak its name"" it has a deadened, passionless air to it.I never bought the love/emotion/desperation between Therese and Carol, played by Rooney Mara and Cate Blanchett. From the first scene in the department store where Therese worked, I viewed Carol's interest as repulsively predatory and it would have been if the part of Carol was played by a middle aged man.Down to the ""erotic"" scene in the hotel, which again was lifeless and uninspiring and well, boring, the whole film had a coldness to it, down to the limp dry hair of the main characters: wigs, I would guess.Carol never comes across as a concerned mother, yes she grabs and hugs her kid a lot but does not engage in any meaningful way with her.The cinematography was well done, the 50s scenes for the most part believable.But for a film about passion and undying love, no, this didn't work for me.3 out of 10.",Carol

69,mossgrymk,carol,7,19 April 2021,"Beautiful and sensitive, with great performances from the two leads, this film, ultimately, feels rather ordinary. Maybe it's the sense that I've been here before with Todd Haynes (""here"" being conformist, 1950s East Coast America) in the better, Sirk homaged ""Far From Heaven"", and he has nothing new to say about it. Or maybe it's Phyllis Nagy's humor starved and conflict challenged screenplay which assumes that the viewer will be fascinated by these two gals simply because they're gorgeous and stylish and gay in a gay baiting land. Or maybe it's Carter Burwell's self consciously tragic score which feels like the lead in to an ad for a cancer care center. Or the cinematography with its annoying granularity that screams ""Oppression"" at us. Whatever it was, by the time Therese finally walks into the Ritz and silently proclaims her love for and desire to live with Carol, and Haynes and Nagy clearly expect me to stand up and cheer, I simply wished them well and wondered if there'd be a sequel where actual struggle between the two, so absent in the preceding two hours, would be examined, as in most good films about human relationships.

70,brchthethird,"Love without labels, for it's own sake",10,25 April 2016,"While there are many things that can be eloquently expressed through language, certain things are better conveyed through actions rather than words. Love is definitely something that falls into the latter category, and CAROL exemplifies this to a tee. Why can't love just be that: love? When did we become so obsessed with labels? In a film about two women who fall in love, the word ""lesbian"" is not uttered once, and is that much better for it. Taking the emphasis on actions/visuals over words/dialogue further, there is much in the film that is conveyed through physical gestures and vague turns of phrase. While this could be interpreted as a nod to the time period in which the story is set (and when the novel was originally published), when certain topics either weren't discussed or talked about in ""code,"" I think it expresses the fundamental inadequacy of language to fully capture the range of human emotion. Also, the emphasis on visuals, completely within Todd Haynes' wheelhouse, makes the film that much more cinematic as a result. The overall style of the film is very tactile, refined, and eloquent. Another reason why the film is so good is the talent in front of the camera. Cate Blanchett and Rooney Mara make a believable couple, even though at first it feels like Carol (Blanchett) might be manipulating Therese (Mara) to satisfy her own selfish desires. Initially, the way in which the relationship was established combined with a Philip Glass-esque score (highly reminiscent of his work in NOTES ON A SCANDAL, also starring Cate Blanchett as a woman in a relationship with a younger person) gave the impression that this was headed to darker dramatic territory than it actually turned out to be. I wasn't quite sure I was onboard until I considered that maybe this was a way to keep the audience on their toes. Shy of that, which I eventually came around to anyway, I was fully invested in the story from beginning to end. The only legitimate negative criticism I can levy against the film is perhaps the title. Aside from being rather non-descript, ""Carol"" isn't really all that accurate, as the film is as much Rooney Mara's as it is Cate Blanchett's, perhaps more so. I also kind of like the original novel's title, ""The Price of Salt,"" which is more suggestive and comes with biblical and philosophical connotations that would probably yield some interesting analysis, or at least correlation, with the film's narrative. Simply put, CAROL is a great film. It successfully straddles two time periods, when the story was written and when the film was actually made, without feeling untrue to either. Perhaps the title character is anachronistic (theoretically, more than literally), but she definitely was ahead of her time, and yet there was no post-modern take to rationalize her existence or the way she is portrayed. She just is, and the relationship she embarks on just is. I cannot more highly recommend CAROL. Just give it a try and let the film speak (or show) for itself.",Carol
71,proud_luddite,Good but perhaps over-rated,7,24 July 2018,"New York City, 1952: Carol Aird (Cate Blanchett) is a wealthy, middle-aged woman in the process of divorcing her husband who is resisting her divorce. While Christmas shopping for her young daughter, she shares a mutual attraction with Therese Belivet (Rooney Mara), a young store clerk who aspires to be a photographer.""Carol"" has the right production values (cinematography, set design, music, and costumes) that help director Todd Haynes recreate a time period long gone. The journey is beautiful in a mysterious way.Blanchett is as great as always. She is as suave as suave could possibly get and she can show the inner conflict of someone whose new relationship could jeopardize having equal custody to her daughter once the divorce proceedings begin.Mara, in a subtle way, conveys the innocence of a young woman coming of age in a very unusual way. I have no doubt of her talents but she was difficult to read at times; she could show depth but sometimes seemed too restrained, rarely changing her facial expression. It's hard to tell if this was the choice of Mara, Haynes, or both.For much of the film, it seemed like the main characters were going through the motions but there could have been more chemistry between them even though repression and conformity were 1950s hallmarks. (An aside: it seems this is the season for movies taking place in New York in the 1950s. ""Brooklyn"" and ""Bridge of Spies"" are two other examples.) Clearly, the benchmark for forbidden same-sex love stories is ""Brokeback Mountain"" (2005). In that film, there was more evidence of tension building between the two lovers. The separation anxiety was also more evident including the excitement of reuniting. This is not to say that ""Carol"" must be similar but it could have used less restraint.It is in the last half-hour that the movie really shines. Blanchett is superb in a scene involving her husband and their lawyers. And later, the film finishes at just the right point leaving only a tiny bit of ambiguity. It left so much subtle emotion that I only wish the rest of the film had been as strong.",Carol
72,maurice_yacowar,Wealthy divorcée finds love and intimacy with innocent shopgirl,9,27 December 2015,"In the vote between convention and passion the eyes have it. Carol and Therese both express profound yearning and strength in their looks at each other. Therese in her innocence is wide-eyed, Carol powerful, drawn back and appraising. That difference catches the predatory element in Carol's love and Therese's various disadvantages in experience and power. In contrast to the two women's emotional looks, a slammed door window frames husband Harge's angry, violent eye. He has isolated himself, framed himself out of his wife's emotions and in refusing to let her go imprisoned himself. Until Harge threatens to sue for sole custody of their daughter, Carol is confident, wealthy, assured. She dresses elegantly, in expensive style, asserting her blondness even in the fur she flaunts, against the more conventional dark mink of the era. Young Therese dresses trimly, in neat plaids and restrained colours and lines, except for the flourish of her bold, ballooning tam, which anticipates her unconventional sexuality. The assigned Santa hat is a brief diminishment which wins her Carol's first encouragement. As in Far From Heaven Todd Haynes uses a 1950s setting, plot line, and characterization to address a contemporary tension. Carol has the perfect '50s heroine response to life: ""Just when it can't get any worse, you run out of cigarettes."" But all the characters are frozen in the '50s confusion between love and desire and all live under the shadow of male-cantered sexuality. The period setting reminds us that we're still not entirely free from considering same-sex love a moral issue. Gay lovers have an easier time today but there remains a stubborn prejudice against following one's heart ""against the grain"" of social convention.When Carol accedes to Harge's custody demand she admits two motives. The primary is to give their daughter the best possible life, to minimize her damage by her parents' conflict. But equally important, she can't ""go against the grain"" of her own nature, neither as a mother nor as a sexual being.That theme raises the film beyond ""love story"" and certainly beyond ""a lesbian love story."" Love, after all, is a nebulous concept. Therese can't get boyfriend Richard to explain what it is. It's what he says makes her attraction to him different from the two women he's already had sex with. (Did i mention that the film is set in the '50s?) Even when Carol tells Therese she loves her what do we know? Or they? Not much beyond the attraction they immediately had for each other — again, registered in their locked eyes across the enchanted department store. As Carol's lifelong friend and ex-lover Abby notes, the passion erupts and then ""things change."" The ardor once faded, what relationship survives? Confirming the ephemerality of ardor, Therese spots Richard dancing with his new girlfriend at the party.The film's main theme then is not lesbian love or even love in general but the related question: how can we determine what we want. As Therese admits, ""I don't know what I want. How could I know what I want if I say yes to everything?"" Of course always saying No is as restrictive as always saying Yes. When she recoils from the Times reporter, Therese says she doesn't mind his premature kiss but clearly has to leave. From the yes she moves to her first tentative 'no.' Two exceptions result from Carol's influence. The first is when Therese doesn't wait to say Yes but takes the initiative to advance their relationship from friends to lovers. The second is when the ""blossomed"" Therese says no to Carol's invitation to move into her new Manhattan flat. Otherwise Therese doesn't know what she wants or needs and just goes with the drift. Finally Therese manages a yes and a no combined. When she declines another lesbian's advance at the Village party she accepts her true nature and leaves to say yes to Carol. This time when they lock glances, Carol — at home amid her social and class peers — still finds another level of satisfaction when she sees Therese has returned. But it's the '50s. She can only smile back.Both need what the other provides, including a rare intimacy. On the phone after their first break Therese says ""I wanna ask you things, but I'm I'm not sure that you want that."" Carol, crying, says ""Ask me things Please."" For all her experience and power, Carol needs to be asked because she craves intimacy. She learns from Therese how to determine what she wants by determining, issue by issue, when to say yes and when no.",Carol
73,sharky_55,I can't help you with that.,7,2 February 2017,"The opening shot of Carol focuses on what seems like an ornate, wrought-iron pattern, before pulling back to reveal filth: a forgotten floor grate on the streets of New York City, and the millions that have walked over it. The camera then follows one gentlemen as he enters real luxury, the restaurant of the Ritz Tower Hotel, and interrupts an intimate reunion. The two women swiftly abscond as if not to provoke further questioning. Much of Carol is concerned with these issues of appearance and reputation, and how people can be more than meets the eye. The film's favourite motif is to shoot Carol and Therese from and behind grimy windows, on the reflections of mirrors and glass, squeezed through gaps and doorways so we almost have to crane our necks to get a peek at their full profile. This partial obscuration reflects their fragmented sense of self in their everyday performance, to have to hide who they truly are. The seemingly single break of character from Carol comes in their second meeting at the diner, where she (once again) takes the initiative to push their relationship beyond simple gratitude, and nervously throws out a proposition for Therese to visit her home (lamely advertised to be pretty scenery, unable to fully hide her true intent), and for a tiny moment is breathless as the question hangs in the air. We get the impression that her life of luxury doesn't usually confront her with these types of odds. But more than that, she is putting her emotions on the line and risking losing it. Certainly the production has captured the allure of the angelic Carol and her sensuous beauty in its most potent form: the textural, tactile sensations which Therese is intoxicated by and what men cannot provide. The soft fur in the mink coat she seems to don like wings, the wave of blonde hair, the immaculately crimson fingernails, and vitally, the weight and feeling behind a parting caress on the shoulder. The pair must initially resort to seduction without lingering touch, so each fleeting hand hold or rub of the shoulders must be accentuated in their gazes, and each casual action, say, a throwing back of the shoulder to waft perfume across the booth, calculated and precise. The waifish Mara is given less to do as per her written role, but sometimes her tentative nature can be mistaken for inertia, leading to some accusations of the relationship being predatory. In some ways, this could seem true; the exquisitely porcelain Blanchett just about eats the diminutive Therese up with her eyes at first glance, and at times Mara just goes along with it. Todd Haynes is openly gay himself, and much of his filmography has been dedicated to advocating for this cause and capturing its anxieties. His debut was the scattershot anthology flick Poison, in which the visible edge and improvisation of a young filmmaker was evident (I still have no idea what the mockumentary of the flying boy is meant to signify). There was also the glitter bomb that was Velvet Goldmine, which had energy and flash reminiscent of Bowie's glam-rock peak but became embarrassingly pretentious once it retreated into its frame narrative. His big hit was Far From Heaven, a formalist exercise wrapped up in the gloss of Douglas Sirk but with a homosexual twist. He took Sirk's issues of classism and updated the story with modern moral responsibilities but retained the style. But Sirk's reappraisals were earned due to the subversive smuggling of his critiques in what were considered to be merely soapy melodramas. Far From Heaven wasn't made in the 50s but in a time where audiences and critics have seen it all, and although Haynes intent is virtuous, the people who really need to see it didn't give the poster a second glance. Its irony forbids it. So Haynes' best and most incisive film is Safe, which doesn't resort to well-tread pastiche, although its existentialist tones are familiar. Carol has a similar notion of earnestness. Gone is the glossy, highly saturated Technicolor, and in its place an earthier palette of yellows, browns and olives. In Far From Heaven the hyper-expressionistic cinematography gave the characters no place to hide, but in Carol, the colours envelop them. Edward Lachman shoots in 16mm so that the grain is highly visible, giving each frame a impressionistic haze. It's the closest to realism that Haynes has gotten since his very early days. The New York landscape becomes a character in itself, mapping Therese's maturation and emotional development: early on timid in its gaze, mostly capturing obscured faces and turned backs, but after meeting Carol, the subjects and environments come to life. It's all still very pretty, and at times impenetrable. The script tends to hold them at arm's length, unable to replicate the inner retrospection of the novel. Blanchett and Mara are gorgeous, too gorgeous, in fact; they rarely break the pretense of these painterly pictures, even as they are alone and away from prying eyes. Carol is never more exposed than in that one moment at the diner, even when they are entwined together in bed. And for all the arguments of category fraud regarding the two's respective screen time, it is Carol's story through and through. Even when Therese is making her own decisions the film is pushing her towards a different goal (the 'painting' of her apartment is merely a slightly lighter shade of blue - intentional, but shallow). I'm mostly and pleasantly surprised at the treatment of the ex-husband, not as an antagonistic force but channeled through impotent rage and the confusion at having his picturesque family shattered. It's happened before, and he won't forget that feeling of helplessness. But Carol's choice is the correct one. What good is a mother's love if she cannot embrace another's?",Carol

But it goes with the tradition of Todd Haynes who works specifically on LGBTQ stories. But what's more about Carol? Why it's the costumes, the lighting, the cinematography, the luscious beautiful acting by Cate Blanchett and Rooney Mara. No wonder the critics swooned, but I'm not that easily impressed. I need to feel moved. I need to know what the love between these two feels like. Forbidden, passionate love. In this film... some times, I felt it, and some times I didn't.

In the 1950s, Carol Aird(Cate Blanchett) is a woman, whose marriage is on the rocks. Though a lot has happened between Carol & her husband, Harge Aird(Kyle Chandler), both of them love their daughter, Rindy Aird(Sadie & Kk Heim) a lot. They ask for joint custody. A young woman named Therese Belivet(Rooney Mara), who works in a shop, finds herself unexpectedly drawn towards Carol, after Carol buys something in her shop once. Carol & Therese soon discover, that they have feelings for each other. This further complicates the issue of Rindy's custody, between Carol & Harge. Carol is an amazing film! Director Todd Haynes has perfectly depicted how love between two people of the same sex, would have been in the 1950s. The costumes by Sandy Powell are gorgeous. Edward Lachman's cinematography, beautifully captures the essence of America in the '50s. The chemistry between Cate Blanchett & Rooney Mara, is restrained & electrifying at the same time. Cate Blanchett is outstanding as Carol Aird. The protagonist's various struggles throughout the film, have been portrayed flawlessly by Blanchett. Rooney Mara is spectacular as Therese Belivet. Mara's nuanced portrayal of Therese, is the standout performance of the movie. Kyle Chandler is great as Harge Aird. Jake Lacy is impressive as Richard Semco. Sarah Paulson is awesome as Abby Gerhard. Cory Michael Smith is superb as Tommy Tucker. Sadie & Kk Heim are adorable as Rindy Aird. The supporting cast is effective.

77,dave-mcclain,"""Carol"" is a beautiful and timely love story.",8,2 January 2016,"Indie. Art house film. Limited release. Select cities. Select theaters. (Needle in a haystack). Those first five phrases are associated with movies that many people won't get a chance to see in American movie theaters. That last phrase (in parentheses) is my translation. While movies that hit theaters in ways that can best be described in restrictive terms don't have the mass appeal of films that immediately (or quickly) appear in wide release, there are still plenty of people who are anxious to see those limited releases. For a Movie Fan who doesn't live in or near Los Angeles or New York City, it can be frustrating to wait for (and sometimes never get) an opportunity to see a highly anticipated film on the big screen.Take ""Carol"" (R, 1:58) for example. That film opened in limited release on November 20, 2015 – in four theaters – in L.A. and New York. A week later, it expanded to a few other markets, but was still in less than two dozen theaters nationwide. On December 25, ""Carol"" was showing in the Top 50 U.S. markets (in about 150 theaters) and continued to expand into January, but still topping out at fewer than 1,000 screens across the country. Such is the case with many films which dare to tackle extraordinary topics and use story-telling and cinematic techniques that differ from your average Hollywood blockbuster. Nothing against the average Hollywood blockbuster, but sometimes films that start in limited release are equally eagerly anticipated by certain open-minded Movie Fans and are often equally worth the wait.After 11 years in development (acutally, nearly two decades, if you count from the first draft of the proposed script), ""Carol"" finally brings Patricia Highsmith's semi-autobiographical 1952 novel ""The Price of Salt"" to the big screen. The book, from the author of ""The Talented Mr. Ripley"", was adapted by Highsmith's friend Phyliss Nagy. In spite of the long wait that many Highsmith fans have endured (and the fact that this film was only released a year after its completion in order for it to debut on the festival circuit), its timing is impeccable. At the end of a year in which the U.S. Supreme Court made marriage equality the law of the land and which saw the release of such timely films as ""Freeheld"", ""Do I Sound Gay?"", ""The D Train"", ""Grandma"", ""Stonewall"" and ""The Danish Girl"", ""Carol"" represents a wonderful and creative final act to a big year for the LGBT community and those who care about equal rights for all.""Carol"" is a love story set in the early 1950s. Oscar winner Cate Blanchett stars as the title character, a wealthy woman living outside New York with her husband, Harge (Kyle Chandler), and their young daughter, Rindy (twins KK and Sadie Heim). When she is in the city to buy a Christmas gift for Rindy, Carol meets Therese (Rooney Mara), a young woman working the counter for the holidays (even though what she really wants to do is become a photographer). Therese has a boyfriend named Richard (Jake Lacy) who loves and wants to marry her, but Therese is hesitating. When Therese finds a pair of gloves that Carol left behind at the store, Therese gets Carol's address off of the sales receipt and mails them to her. (No, this wasn't Radio Shack. It's the 50s, when many stores recorded their customers' addresses.) Carol calls the store and offers to thank Therese for her kindness by taking her to dinner. Although there is a significant age difference between the women (not to mention a big difference in social standing), there is an undeniable attraction between them. They are both very slow to act on their feelings for each other, preferring instead to simply spend time together, first at Carol's house for the holidays, then at Therese's apartment looking at her photography, and later, on a spontaneous cross-country road trip.But nothing will come easily for Carol and Therese. Carol's marriage has been poisoned by her secret attraction to other women, which included a youthful tryst with Carol's childhood friend, Abby (Sarah Paulson), with whom Carol remains friends. Those old wounds are reopened for Harge when Therese shows up in his home. Carol and Harge were already in the process of divorcing, but Therese's presence in Carol's life greatly complicates that situation. Their love is developing at a time and place when same-sex romantic relationships were widely considered immoral – including within the nation's court system.""Carol"" is a beautiful motion picture in every sense of the word. For Movie Fans ready to accept it, the love story between the two main characters is tender and heartfelt. Although the film clearly shows the difficulties inherent in a lesbian love affair in the early 50s, the social and legal ramifications never take over the story, which remains focused on the relationship between these two women. Their romance plays out as influenced more by who they are as people and what is happening in their lives than by external factors. It makes for a very effective film.Enhancing the sense of time and place, previous Oscar nominee, director Todd Haynes, ensures impeccable set design and costume work, then has his cinematographer use a technique which makes the film appear somewhat grainy, giving it a definite 1950s' feel. (Some may find this off-putting, but you get used to it and it really adds to the film's effectiveness.) Last but certainly not least, Blanchett and Mara each do some of the best work of their careers. ""Carol"" started out as a ""limited release"" and can be called an ""art house film"", but I just call it great storytelling, and definitely worth waiting for. ""A-""",Carol
78,swilliky,Carol is a dull affair!,3,17 January 2016,"I'm at a loss with this movie. I went to the late showing last night, which was a mistake because this drama about two lovers persecuted by ignorance and misogyny will exploit any fatigue you have and try desperately to put you to sleep. I struggle through nearly two hours of this movie and eventually gave up and left figuring that not much else would happen as nothing did happen throughout the entire first three quarters. I went and read some spoiler discussion on it on a clickbait website to find that I didn't miss much.Don't get me wrong, these actresses are at the top of their game with strong performances by both lead Cate Blanchett and Rooney Mara. It's the script that seems dull to me. The drama and romance appear so distant and tension so boring that it was nearly impossible to get close to these characters and care.

79,bob-the-movie-man,"""Ask me the questions - - Please""",8,3 December 2015,"""Carol"" rates as one of the most romantic films of 2015. But whereas most romantic movies involve some form of love triangle (as per the recent ""Brooklyn"") this film is more of a convoluted square - a 'love trapezium' perhaps - with significant lesbian content. In fact the film bears many similarities to ""Brooklyn"" - both films are set around the late 40's / early 50's; both are set in New York; and both concern the love interest of a department store shop-girl. There though the similarities end. Cate Blanchett plays the rich and privileged Carol Belivet with Rooney Mara (""The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo"") as the shop-girl Therese, with broader photojournalism ambitions. Therese becomes instantly attracted to her in a US society much less tolerant of homosexuality than current times. In fact in a era before 'gay bars' it is quite mystical how these relationships ever got voiced and consummated (Carol - ""Ask me the questions.... Please""). Carol's similar passion, with childhood friend Abby (Sarah Paulson from ""12 Years a Slave""), has driven a wedge through her marriage to the (not unreasonably) frustrated Harge (Kyle Chandler from ""Super 8"" and ""Zero Dark Thirty""). Their young daughter Rindy (twins Sadie and Kk Helm) is the pawn in the ongoing marital battle. The film is exquisitely put together. Let's start for once with the music by Carter Burwell (""Twilight"", ""Fargo"") which grabs the attention from the first frame, a luscious melody of cello and piano that sets the tone of the film perfectly. Add in to the mix a plethora of music from the era and you have a beautifully dynamic soundtrack that I would like to see up for an Oscar nomination.While I've never personally been a mad fan of Cate Blanchett's acting, here her affected manner suits the role to a T. But the real star turn of the piece is Rooney Mara. Channeling a young Audrey Hepburn, Mara is utterly compelling to look at as she rides the roller-coaster of Patricia Highsmith's story (""The Price of Salt""). For me, an Oscar nomination shoe-in.Between them, the pair build up an extraordinary sexual tension throughout the film with the camera taking long lingering shots of Carol's fingers and body. This tension rises steadily and relentlessly until the inevitable scene of release, which is done with lots of flesh and eroticism but also with real gentleness and beauty, reminiscent of ""Desert Hearts"". (Mara also looks gorgeous: as Therese opens her gown, Carol breathes ""I've never looked like that"" and you can here all of the women in the audience silently agreeing with her!)There's a significant twist in the tale though which you don't see coming, and one which adds a different dimension to the film (albeit one that feels as a viewer rather unwelcome).The art department also supplies fodder for the Oscar cannon. Legendary costume designer and multiple Academy Award winner Sandy Powell delivers fantastic period costumes. And both the cinematography and film editing by Edward Lachman and Affonso Gonçalves respectively is gorgeous: a scene of Therese on a train panning through steamy windows to her arrival at home by taxi is a masterclass in composition and editing. In the director's chair is Todd Haynes, none of whose previous cinema releases (dating back to 1991), I recognize. but he's nailed this one. Whilst the subject matter might prove challenging for those who feel uncomfortable watching a bit of 'girl on girl action' the film is a beautiful love story. A film deserving respect and recommended for anyone who has a beating heart, and particularly (I would imagine, given the book's loyal following) those in all female relationships.(Please visit bob-the-movie-man.com to see the graphical version of this review.

80,tm-sheehan,Style and Substance,9,22 August 2020,"My Review Carol -
My Score 9/10
I rewatched Carol last night and thought as I hadn't reviewed it on IMBD in 2015 when it was released that it deserved one today .
Carol had a long journey to the Screen ,it was in development since 1997, when Phyllis Nagy wrote the first draft of the screenplay based on the novel ""The Price of Salt"" by Patricia Highsmith.
A GLBTQI film and a Lesbian Love story back then saw the eyes of Studio Executives glaze over and ask for the next script.
It was also difficult to find two top notch actresses who would risk their career and reputation to take on the roles of Carol Aird and Therese Belivet.
Thank goodness they waited for Cate Blanchett to play Carol the sophisticated wealthy stylish and beautiful wife in the throws of a messy separation from husband Harge and Rooney Mara as Therese the much younger elfin like shop assistant working in the toy department of a large New York Department store.
When their chance encounter first occurs Carol is looking for a Christmas gift for her child and the sexual energy in their first glance sets the scene for a tempestuous affair that will have consequences in each woman's life.
I watched an Actors discussion show recently with Cate Blanchett and Sir Ian McKellen and they compared this story to the famous film Brief Encounter .
I agree it moved me the first time I saw it and more on second viewing.
I think unlike other films with lesbian characters like The Killing of Sister. George "" which is a great film as well but in my observation Carol is unique as it shows the pain, discrimination and inequality of the law in 1952 for male and female homosexuals alike.
If a traditional heterosexual couple had an affair outside their marriage ,as long as it was with the opposite sex the parents of that marriage at least usually would be granted equal rights of access to their children but same sex no way it was seen as a moral danger and the scene in the lawyers office between husband and wife in Carol is dramatically tense and emotionally charged with sadness and cruelty.
Carol is a great companion film to the great 2002 film ""Far from Heaven."" set in the same early 1950's era with the opposite scenario in ""Far From Heaven "" it's the husband who is gay and the wife who is left alone.
It's no accident I realised as Todd Haynes directed ""Far from Heaven "" also as well as
Carol .Todd Haynes has a superb sense of style and emotional instinct . It's no wonder both actresses in these movie Julianne Moore and Cate Blanchett deservedly were nominated for Best Actress Academy Awards for their performances.
Carol is a stylish movie and very entertaining a little slow in parts but it needs to be to build the emotion and tension I'm glad both films were huge Box office successes.
Carol premiered at the Cannes Film Festival on May 17, 2015, Grossing over $42 million on an $11 million budget, the film was praised for Haynes's direction and the performances of Cate Blanchett and Rooney Mara, and was the best-reviewed film of 2015. Carol competed for the Palme d'Or at Cannes, where Rooney Mara tied for the Best Actress award. The film received many accolades, including five Golden Globe Award nominations, six Oscarnominations, and nine BAFTA Award nominations; as well as five Dorian Awards and awards from the New York Film Critics Circle, Los Angeles Film Critics Association, and National Society of Film Critics. It featured prominently in several ""best of"" film lists.
I must mention the wonderful film score of Carol by Carter Burwell it's an example of music adding so much emphasis on the action and the dialogue. He's composed so many great scores for movies like Fargo, Three Billboards Outside Ebbing Twilight In Bruges a favourite of mine also the elegant costumes of designer Sandy Powell that make Cate and Rooney look fabulous and authentic to the 1950's I'm certain Rooney Mara was influenced by Audrey Hepburn in this role ,perhaps because Audrey also appeared in a lesbian themed film in 1961 ""The Children's Hour"" although the theme of Lillian Hellman's play was a little sanitised for that time it's still a great film (perhaps a remake is called for?)",Carol
81,Likes_Ninjas90,It is equally political and broadly universal and applicable in its aim of dramatising an unexpected trace of love that might be true and worth following,8,16 January 2016,"Carol is an engrossing and understated drama about two women at different stages of their lives that realise through their feelings that they are in love with each other. Their romance is orchestrated by director Todd Haynes, an openly gay independent filmmaker, who often makes films about the subject of gender, sexuality and changing social values. One example of his work was Far From Heaven (2002), which starred Julian Moore as a housewife who tried to befriend an African American man amongst the bigotry of the suburbs in 1950s America. With this film, Haynes has sourced Patricia Highsmith's 1950s novel The Price of Salt to evoke similar themes of changing values. The novel was said to be inspired by Highsmith's own relationships with both men and women. Imagine the controversy it must have arrested at the time. In the 1950s, America's post-war period was deeply repressive of homosexuals as it headed into the Cold War. The Lavender Scares was an example of one of the campaigns used to discriminate and punish homosexuals, often by associating them with Communists, who themselves were blacklisted, imprisoned or fired from their jobs. Carol's recreation of this difficult period is also about today and how the desire to grasp equal rights and representation is still a struggle that runs strong. However, Todd Haynes and screenwriter Phyllis Nagy opt to observe the minor behaviour and attitudes of the period and characters rather than highlighting specific historical moments. The film stars Rooney Mara (The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo) as Therese Belivet, a young woman that works in a department store. Her main relationship with her boyfriend Richard (Jake Lacey) isn't romantic or interesting to her. She's reluctant to travel with him in spite of his persistence. We see them interacting with their friends, watching films through the projector window of a cinema or getting drunk together in a bar. At one point, one of their friends shows her his office in the New York Times while they drink and then tries kissing her. These are young people who have limited long-term prospects and this complacency propels the uncertainty of Therese's life. The life of Carol (Cate Blanchett) seems equally unfulfilled, despite living under a wealthier social status. She is deeper into her life than Therese, being a mother and sitting in the middle of a divorce from her husband Harge (Kyle Chandler) and also having more sexual experience given she once had an affair with her friend Abby (Sarah Paulson). She bitterly assures Harge that she and Abby were over long before they were, stressing it wasn't a change in sexuality that dissolved their marriage. As Harge and Carol argue over their young daughter, it is clear that he still loves her and can't let go. But her heart and her eyes fall onto Therese after they meet by chance at the department store. The gloves she leaves on the store counter prompt Therese to return them by contacting Carol and entering her complex life. The uniqueness of their relationship is that the two women are almost entirely committed by a sense of feeling. The singularity of the connection is a contrast to films that contrive a romantic connection by parallel backstories and personal histories. Carol and Therese are long removed from their experiences in their age (the actors are 16 years apart), their economic status and their understanding of the world. The weight of their relationship, the content and shape of the film, is the generous amount of time dedicated towards these two characters feeling and sensing each other until they realise the binary of their emotions. Initially, Therese is deeply unsure of herself. She can barely decide on her order when the two women eat lunch together and she won't leave her boyfriend even though she doesn't love him. Rooney Mara, with her best performance, beautifully paints the shyness and delicacy of Therese through a quiet, nervous energy that filters through her sad face and eyes. A deep emotional resonance protrudes through her displacement, particularly a sad scene where she helplessly observes Harge and Carol fight and then cries on her way home. Meanwhile, Carol's self-confidence and dry wit corrodes with the realisation that these are feelings of love, not lust, that are infiltrating her life. Given Therese's young age, it is a passage of uncertainty for Carol herself when she concedes with Abby she doesn't know what she's doing. Both women are coming of age, but at different stages of their lives, realising what satisfies them sexually and mentally and having the power of choice, free from the men who disappointment them but regularly prolong their romantic feelings because it's all they understand. These are not terrible men but merely incapable of comprehending the interiors of women. Richard ridicules Therese when they discuss being in love with someone of the same gender, perhaps because people rarely talked about the subject openly in these times, which further underlines the theme of uncertainty in this period.",Carol

83,oOoBarracuda,An Instant Classic: Carol,10,20 January 2016,"It's not often that a film like Carol comes along. A film so beautifully shot, about such important subject matter, so flawlessly acted; leaving one in a state of shock after the first time they have seen it. Such an important film, Carol is one that will restore your faith in the current state of cinema. In the age of Hollywood blockbusters, simply trying to fill seats with copious amounts of action, it is reassuring that a work of true film art, such as Carol, is still being so exceptionally made.To pose the claim that Carol is one-dimensional could not be farther from the truth. Love, self, society, and sacrifice are explored in the film Carol; issues which affect each individual. Passively observing her life unfold, Therese Belivet (Rooney Mara) exists as an unfulfilled being in all aspects of her life. Living in a shabby New York apartment which she cannot even afford to adequately heat, Therese stumbles through her daily existence. Riding on the handlebars of her insipid ""boyfriend"" to her daily work at a department store where she is reduced to just another holiday hat wearing drone, it is clear to see that Therese is unhappy with the dull ache that has become her life. Finding refuge in her photographs, Therese escapes her unhappiness and finds fulfillment in honing her photography talents. One magical day changes the course of Therese's mundane existence. A stunningly classic beauty exuding wealth named Carol (Cate Blanchett) happens upon Therese's display at the department store. There is moving art in their exchange, as one can soon pick up on the discontent Carol projects ever so subtlety. Carol Aird is a prisoner of her own life; stuck in a loveless marriage, mother to a child she adores, Carol is living proof that even when one enjoys great wealth, as she does, happiness can still only be an illusion. Sharing a mutual distaste for their own lives and harboring feelings they themselves were often too afraid to feel, Carol and Therese set out on to travel; to escape their glum realities, even temporarily. As the two continue their quest, protected by isolation, their inhibitions dissipate, and they begin to explore the loving reality that is their relationship. The internal struggle of being a married lesbian mother in the early 1950's proves too much for Carol to bear, as she abandons the trip and returns home to fight for custody of her daughter against her imposing husband Harge (Kyle Chandler) Devastated at the seeming end to the purposeful existence she has so longed for, Therese finds it impossible to return to her normal work at the department store. Invigorated by a new sense of purpose, Therese channels her pain in her pictures, taking a job at a newspaper where she can explore photography full-time. Carol also finds it intolerable to return to her prior life; renewed with strength, Carol finally stands up to Harge, vowing to never again go against her grain. Carol is what she is, whether society approves or not, and after she realizes that, there may be hope yet for true love.Based on the novel The Price of Salt, by Patricia Highsmith, Carol is beautifully photographed against the seminal images of life in the 1950's. Edward Lachman's cinematography work on this film is nothing short of poetic, as the audience is guided deeper and deeper into the crux of forbidden love in the ""good ole' days"". Cate Blanchett turns out a career best performance as the titular character defined by the society she is a part of, yet wants nothing to do with. Rooney Mara's performance of a young girl learning about even the suppressed facets of her own self was stellar. The direction of Todd Haynes was extraordinary in delivering such a raw, relentless love, told almost exclusively through subtlety. Powerfully shot with a heavy reliance on filming through windows or opposite mirrors, Haynes allows the audience to explore how much of their selves can only be viewed from within, and how much of a distorted display our true self is when exposed to those around us. Accompanied by a powerful score, Carol is a masterpiece to be viewed the world over for its brilliance in capturing feelings so relatable to everyday life within the human condition.Brilliantly written, with remarkable production design and costumes, Carol is the most beautiful film I've seen in years. A truly intoxicating experience; if given the chance, Carol transforms the viewer to a place where it is not OK to be who you are meant to be, and on some level, everyone can relate to this feeling. A rare form of near perfection is captured on screen through Todd Haynes' masterwork. Carol is a film that should be enjoyed by masses for years to come.",Carol
84,SquigglyCrunch,"Almost Masterfully Made, but...",8,4 October 2016,"Carol follows a young woman as she falls for an older woman. This movie is masterfully made. Seriously, the writers and director knew what they were doing. To start, the writing is excellent. It's realistic and engaging to listen to, and often conversations that we really don't need to hear are completely left out to allow the audience to just take the implication the film is making and assume that it already happened. We skip out on all these overlong, clichéd conversations. That, among other things, made the writing pretty fantastic. The acting is pretty great. Rooney Mara is amazing, and Cate Blanchett is, as expected, great. They're genuine and interesting, and the writing only helps this aspect. Somehow Rooney Mara was nominated for best actress in a supporting role, despite being more important than Cate Blanchett's character. Seriously, the Oscars really screwed up in 2016. The shots are pretty fantastic too. The camera is positioned in just the right places, moving in just the right ways. It was pretty refreshing to see a movie where the cameraman knows how to use a camera well. Throughout the first two acts I was thinking: ""This will easily be a 9/10, or dare I see even a 10/10"" but then the third act abruptly dropped. The first half of it was pretty sloppy, weak, and a little clichéd. For the most part it picked itself up after that, but the ending just wasn't as strong as the rest of the movie. Furthermore this movie is pretty slow. It's not that it's boring, but it's slow, and it's not really a movie I can see myself ever wanting to see again partially due to this fact. Overall Carol is a fantastic movie, but it lacks in pacing and a third act as good as the rest of the movie. In the end I'd recommend this movie.",Carol
85,garethcrook,50s American charm,7,18 May 2018,"The production design on this is beautiful. Even in its less glamorous scenes, it oozes 50s American charm. It's a fake world and a perfect setting for this story, an exercise in social control bristling with tense expectation and makes for a perfect setting for this love story. It's almost dreamlike, both Blanchett and Mara effortlessly floating from scene to scene. Mara, innocent, playful. Blanchett, cold, mysterious. Dialogue delivered calmly, the camera allowed to linger and drift. Music poignant, haunting. It's not all plain sailing of course, far from it, but the ups and downs are timed perfectly, the editor (Affonso Gonçalves) doing his work perfectly. In fact the pacing of the whole thing is pretty amazing. It's very much a film of twos. Two people, two worlds, light and dark. Fantastic!",Carol
86,rubenm,"Kiss me, Cate",8,16 January 2016,"There's an essay to be written about the touching of shoulders in this film. I counted at least six occasions of a hand squeezing a shoulder. Sometimes innocently, sometimes desperately. Sometimes with a meaning, sometimes without. Sometimes passionately, sometimes not. Sometimes so significantly, it's shown twice in the movie.The shoulder touching is just a detail. But this is a film in which details are important. It's not just the shoulder touching. It's also the dry-Martini-ordering, the shedding of tears, the clothing, the hairdo's, the answering of phone calls, and I could go on. This is not a film with spectacular plot twists, or breathtaking action scenes. It's subtle gestures, and understated acting that make this a wonderful film.In fact, the only major plot element there is - the private detective - seems poorly explained. But that doesn't matter. This film is about emotions - about a forbidden lesbian love affair in the early fifties, to be exact, and about what that does to people.The beautiful cinematography, showing the elegance of the early fifties in all its splendour, is a joy to watch. Just seeing two elegantly dressed and headscarved women driving along in an open 1950 Packard, regardless of the cold weather in December, is a beautiful sight.The same goes for the acting of Cate Blanchett, as the cool, debonair femme fatale, and Rooney Mara as the young, innocent ingénue. Both give strong, restrained performances, in perfect accordance with the formality of the fifties.",Carol
87,beresfordjd,Beautiful but disappointing,6,21 September 2016,"No-one can deny Cate Blanchette's appeal. She is an astonishingly beautiful and classy woman, much in the mould of the screen goddesses of the past. Not only that but she really can act - only Meryl Streep can match or surpass her in my eyes. She is wonderful in this movie as is Rooney Mara who, at some points, seems to be channelling Audrey Hepburn. That said this film disappointed me overall as it left the conclusion hanging in the air and seemed to have more of the story to tell. The film looked great and the period feel was spot on for me. One surprise was Kyle Chandler as Carol's (Cate's) husband, Harge (was this name or nickname?). I have only ever seen him in made for TV stuff and was impressed that he held his own with such great actors as Mara,Paulson and Blanchette. He was very good in it in a difficult part with which to sympathise. There was an inevitability about the whole enterprise which made one want the film to move a little faster to its conclusion. I just wanted it to be better than it was although it was never exactly boring it was too slow for me.",Carol
88,ClaytonDavis,'Carol' Puts Blanchett and Paulson at the Top of their Game!,6,30 September 2015,"The seduction and hypnosis of a Todd Haynes film is hard to deny. His attention to detail in such films like ""Far from Heaven"" and ""I'm Not There"" are simply superb, and one cannot overlook the vision he engulfs upon as he directs each one of them. In his newest venture, ""Carol,"" which is based on the book ""The Price of Salt"" by Patricia Highsmith, the luxurious command in which he approaches the material is confident and pristinely evident once again. He pulls out some outstanding performances, especially from Cate Blanchett and Sarah Paulson, and crafts another multi-layered deconstruction on love during a time where it was simply one note to modern society. With all that said, there's a barrier between the film's central characters and its audience, resulting in a good, not great cinematic endeavor.""Carol"" tells the story of Therese (pronounced TER-REZ and played by Rooney Mara), a department store clerk who dreams of a better life outside the normalcy of work and her persistent beau Richard (played by Jake Lacy). Set in 1950s New York, she falls for an older, married woman names Carol (played by Blanchett), and the two embark on a journey of forbidden love.""Carol"" is as lusciously made as you come to expect from any Haynes film. Sexy, sultry, and vibrantly crafted, Haynes pours his heart and soul into each frame he directs with generous and respectful admiration. He transports us to a time we can only see in our dreams, with stunning cloths of the 1950's, thanks to outstanding Sandy Powell, and gorgeous set design, thanks to Judy Becker and Heather Loeffler.The script by Phyllis Nagy, whose only credit is the TV Movie ""Mrs. Harris,"" which she also directed and was nominated for an Emmy, is profound in parts. It's natural to go back to something like ""Brokeback Mountain"" for comparison, a story that succeeded so much on the subtle and quietly spoken thoughts of its characters. We see their love present in a secret kiss on the side of an apartment, or on a quiet standing by a camp fire as Ennis goes to take care of the caddle for the night. These are factors that add to up a forbidden love.In ""Carol,"" there's a missing variable in Carol and Therese's relationship. They meet, flirt awkwardly, and then suddenly are together in a strange circumstance. Now, one can argue that love knows no boundaries of time nor space. Perhaps you would be correct in that, but the main difference between Ennis and Jack versus Carol and Therese, is that the love in the former felt just as high-stakes at what they threatened to lose. Ennis loses his family, wanders the Earth essentially, still unsure of his own place, even without theoretically any more obstacles. Yet, Jack visits him upon the news of his impending divorce, and with still a real fear of exile and being true to himself, Ennis sends him away. Jack is heartbroken by this behavior, that translates well into one of the most iconic lines, ""I wish I knew how to quit you.""Carol feels like Ennis in this regard, destined to live alone despite embracing her own sensibilities and self. However , in Therese's young, unconfident mind, she doesn't equal or amount to the yin, of Carol's yang. Her exploration comes off like curiosity rather than love. Perhaps that's the intent, and if it is, then I applaud it, but when the film reaches its conclusion, nothing supports that claim. I find little reason to root for these two to be together. ""Blue is the Warmest Color,"" even with intense and ill-fitting explicit scenes, manages to show the passion between the two main characters. I think that's the key word that's missing from the film: passion.With those hurdles, some of the performances surpass any and all expectations. With a stellar year in hand with James Vanderbilt's ""Truth"" already loved by so many, Cate Blanchett delivers an even more breathtaking portrayal in Haynes' film. Blanchett captures the lioness quality of Carol, steaming forward with blinders on as she finds herself entranced by Therese's innocence. Her slow, sultry hand moving across her lover's shoulder is a vibrant action that speaks impeccable volumes. I thought it was one of her best performances ever.Rooney Mara's sensitive yet disengaged nature from her surroundings is particularly moving as she walks through the film. Her quiet breakdowns are felt in the moment but have no lasting effect for the rest of the story. With such strong Supporting Actress buzz for the performance, I'm a little baffled by its unanimous love fest. Especially when standing next to the great Sarah Paulson, whose role and performance will hawk back to Patricia Clarkson in ""Far from Heaven"" but with such depth and assurance. Not exactly developed to its full potential, but as Abby, Carol's best friend and former flame, Paulson engages it all with a vigorous and palpable energy. As Carol's husband Harge, Kyle Chandler's desperation and urgency is lively and vivid, but with not enough substance and time to really make an impact.""Carol"" is fruitful in the cinematic capacity of its structure but it leaves some things to be desired. For a Haynes enthusiast, they'll likely run the gauntlet on its construction and performances, eating every morsel of it up with a spoon. For others, the appreciation will surely be clear, but there may be some that are left out in the cold.",Carol
89,MattBrady099,Carol - Movie Review,9,20 December 2015,"Therese Belivet: ""I don't know what I want. How could I know what I want if I say yes to everything?"".Carol is set in 1950s New York, a department-store clerk dreams of a better life for himself and finds himself falling for an older, married woman.Before Carol was even release, it had a lot of Oscar talk with the two main leads and the story itself. It's one of those period piece movies that people start talking about how many awards it's going to win (It's mostly Gold Derby predictions) and not actually talking about the movie itself, only the awards and it's quite sad when I think about it. But all that a side, I've been anticipating Carol for awhile now, just because of the two main stars and the beautiful teaser trailer that got me interested in seeing it. And after seeing Carol I am lost with words right now, I mean wow. It's without a doubt the best movie of the year.Cate Blanchett continues to amaze me and I don't think it's going to stop anytime soon. Shes tremendous in everything movie I've seen her in and in Carol she amazed me even more. Blanchett was absolutely phenomenal in this movie as she delivered such a powerful performance. It's by far her best performance and movie (In my personal opinion). I basically ran out of things to say about her, since I always say the same good things about her performance. I think sometimes things are too brilliant to be put into words and it's best to be watched.Rooney Mara has come along way, because if you look at her track record of all the movies shes been in. She can star in a bad movie like the 2010 remake of A Nightmare on Elm Street and then later appear in The Social Network. Same thing can be said this year as she was in ""Pan"" which was a massive piece of crap and she was so bad in that movie, but not here, because Mara gives a stunning and brilliant performance. Mara and Blanchett both deliver a stellar performance and both of them had great chemistry, I mean it was really touching and quite beautiful to watch.With a movie like this you would think the romance between the two would be overly sloppy or repetitive like some romantic movies, but not this one. There's only a few scenes in this movie where one of them say ""I love you"" but that's it and it's never repeated. The thing I love about this movie is that the romance didn't feel force or cliché. The one thing I can't stand in romance movies is where the two lovers talk about how much they love each other and why they love each other, I mean screen writing like that is just the worse, but Carol avoids all that and goes for a creative way of showing the romance that's best to be seen and felt. There's a scene in this movie that's personally my favorite scene of this year so far, and that's when the two of them are in the car going through a highway tunnel. Then we get to see Rooney Mara character (Therese) point of view as she looks at Carol and you as an audience member get to see what makes Carol so special in Therese's eyes. The scene itself has no dialogue, it was beautifully shot and it's short but wonderful. It may not mean a lot to some people but to me it dose and I wish we had more film making like this, because it's an original and brilliant way of showing human connection, I mean it's much better than the character's repeatedly saying ""I love you"" to each other.Todd Haynes did an excellent job directing this movie. Everything that a good director should do in movies is what Todd Haynes dose here. He's the glue to all of this and he brilliantly crafted such a powerful film.The cinematography in the movie was magnificent as it had the perfect shots that fitted the story really well. The art direction, the costumes, and the writing were flawless.Now for the flaws: My only flaw in this movie has to be that some of the supporting characters were pretty forgettable and could have easily be cut out of the movie.Overall Carol is a beautifully crafted movie that tells an emotional story that's so nailed down to reality. It's a movie worth seeing if you haven't checked it out yet.",Carol
90,ethanbresnett,Such a beautiful love story,9,30 December 2020,"Carol is one of those films that draws you in and has you on tenterhooks from start to finish. It is so stylish, so thoughtful, so tender and achingly beautiful.This is in no small part due to the performances of Cate Blanchett and Rooney Mara, who are both stunning. Cate Blanchett just had this visceral aura around her in this film which was so captivating. I can't remember the last time I was this drawn into a performance. The chemistry between the two of them was spot on, and they played the characters perfectly.Speaking of the characters, they were so interesting and well crafted, making them feel so real and authentic I loved the arc of both of them, and was so invested in them and their journeys.The story is so beautiful, and felt very real, full of genuine emotion and heart. I loved the screenplay. It was so slow and gentle in a poignant way, and had so many beautiful moments.As well as all of this, the film was shot perfectly. It has a great score and every shot was oozing style and suspense.Carol is one of those films that deserves all of its plaudits. Absolutely stunning.",Carol
91,CineMuseFilms,This is one Blanchett film that struggles to inspire.,6,11 February 2016,"Against a backdrop of modern progress towards same-sex marriage, the 1950s story of two women finding love in each other has a strangely out-of-date feel that lingers throughout Carol (2015). It's a beautiful period piece that meticulously re-creates the fine detail of the era and is an adaptation of The Price of Salt (1952), a novel about the love that could not be named before the sexual revolution. Cate Blanchett is Carol, the experienced older seductress who is going through a messy divorce and custody battle, while Rooney Mara is Therese, the young novice who is swept away by the attractive and wealthy socialite. The tension between their acting styles is unsettling. Blanchett's tightly over-controlled emotions appear shallow, even when the two of them are behind closed doors, while Mara slides gracefully across a broad emotional spectrum with skillful nuance and natural radiance. It's a slow story and their only sex scene, far from erotic, is clinical like many of Carol's responses to Therese.Their love affair inevitably hits male hurdles, and at least some narrative energy is generated not by what happens between Carol and Therese, but between them and the hostile bullies who are husband and boyfriend. The male egos are tortured by the possibility that their women could prefer women, and their attempts to control with veiled aggression put todays domestic violence dispute into an historical frame. The legal system was equally brutish and so favoured men that women had no hope of keeping their children once they were tarnished as ""immoral"". But despite star billing, meticulously crafted sets and evocative soft-focus atmospherics, this is one Blanchett film that struggles to inspire.",Carol
92,TaylorYee94,It's just a beautiful love story,8,24 August 2021,"Usually LGBTQ films portray characters' struggle, fight against society, and decisions to close or open. Rather, 'Carol' focuses on Carol and Therese's intimacy, love, and heartbreak. The story sticks to personal level, so it can go deeper and closer.There are some factors that contribute to intensify romantic atmosphere: camera angle & composition and setting. First, when audience sees Carol or Therese, there are some things in between: through the window, sometimes mist and rain on the window, making objects blurry and through blocking walls on the sides so wee see the woman standing in narrow view. All those means let viewers feel as if they are taking a 'glimpse' of a couple. Haynes moves audience into the movie almost physically, reducing the distance between them and the screen.The director brings back not only physical aspect of New York in 1950s but also aesthetic and vibe. This time, Haynes moves us back in time when romance was bloomed, adding a sense of nostalgia as well. Styling, color, lighting, weather, props.. All are just perfect for the setting, making romance more romantic.",Carol
93,gsygsy,Engrossing,10,9 November 2015,"A perfect marriage of director and material, I can't think of anyone else but Todd Haynes for this story of love and desire blossoming in a desert of repression. Set in the era of the McCarthy witchhunts and the post-war obsession with - one might as well call it panic about- gender roles, CAROL is based on a Patricia Highsmith novel. Playwright Phyllis Nagy's screenplay pays Highsmith the compliment of maintaining the psychological conflicts and complexities. In particular, the character of Carol's conventional husband, Harge (played by Kyle Chandler) could have, in lesser hands, received much shorter shrift than here. Beautifully photographed, designed, edited, scored and acted, there's no reason to give it anything less than full marks. I was completely engrossed by it from start to finish.",Carol
94,asc85,Another overrated 2015 release,5,29 December 2015,"As my ""5"" rating indicates, I didn't think this was a ""bad"" movie. However, it is disappointing and frustrating when this has been heralded as one of the best films of 2015, and it's not even close. Was I supposed to be blown away by showing a lesbian relationship taking place in 1952 America? Yes, I ""get"" that a lesbian relationship in 1952 was extremely risky. Maybe if a film like this was released in the 1950's, I would have been blown away by it, but it was released in 2015. As I was watching this movie, I kept thinking, ""if this was about a heterosexual relationship rather than a lesbian relationship, would other people still think this was interesting?"" I believe they wouldn't be interested in it. There really isn't much happening. Not only that, it is also very clichéd. The opening scene of Mara and Blanchett...I just knew they were going to revisit that scene at the end, but this time, it would, ""mean so much more to us."" And at the very end, when we're supposed to wonder what Blanchett is thinking? Another cliché, and no surprise at all.The only thing about this film that stands out is Rooney Mara's performance. If she gets Oscar-nominated as Best Supporting Actress, I think she'll be a favorite, and she'll deserve to be one. I have little doubt this film will receive a number of Oscar nominations, but honestly, with the exception of Mara, it doesn't deserve to be nominated, and certainly should not win anything.",Carol
95,dcarsonhagy,Simply Beautiful,9,12 April 2016,"Last night was my first time to view ""Carol,"" a film which came highly recommended and highly awarded. The film is based on a novel by Patricia Highsmith's novel, ""The Price of Salt."" The movie is about two women--Carol (wonderfully played by Cate Blanchett) and Therese (very well underplayed by Rooney Mara) who have a chance meeting in a department store where Therese works. Although the women seem at the opposite ends of the social spectrum, each feels an immediate attraction to the other. I will not go any further into the story line. There are a few twists and turns along the way which will most definitely keep the viewer interested. You find out that Carol is in a marriage of convenience, and it is only when her husband raises her fitness to raise their daughter does Carol actually find her voice. Cate Blanchett and Rooney Mara are impeccable as the two principles. The remaining cast is also to be complimented on their expert acting. There was not one character in the movie that seemed out of place or unconvincing. Director Todd Haynes has a knack for knowing when to pull back the camera and when to continue a scene. He realizes that--and so few directors do--sometimes less is more.Rated ""R"" for one pretty intense love scene and some language, I highly recommended this movie. I will alert potential viewers that this movie is CHARACTER DRIVEN. If you're thinking you have rented a movie that is going to titillate you because of the subject matter, don't waste your time. The movie lasts 118 minutes.",Carol
96,markgorman,A poignant and beautiful study of love.,9,19 December 2015,"This is a quite magnificent exploration of sexual awakening unlike anything I've ever seen and directed with such a firmness of hand as to be an immediate contender for Best Director at this year's Oscars. Fans of MTV series Mildred Pierce will see some similarities, but this is period movie-making on a peerless scale.Every second of screen time has a period detail that takes your breath away, so assume an Oscar will also be heading the way of Judy Becker (Design) and Jesse Rosenthal (Art Direction) as well as Sandy Powell's costumes. Honestly, it makes Mad Men look heavy handed. That may in part be down to the gorgeous cinematography by Edward Lachman (Virgin Suicides). The music by Carter Burwell will also be in the mix come judgement day. So that's six Oscars before we even get to the main talking point. So; Rooney Mara or Cate Blanchett?This movie is like watching the equivalent of the Rumble in the Jungle - the two greatest boxers of their generation, one on the ascent, the other at the peak of their powers - so too here. Marra the lady in waiting, Blanchett at a dizzying career high after last year's electrifying Blue Jasmine performance.As the title character you would expect her to dominate the proceedings but that wholly underestimates the abilities of Rooney Mara who often, and tantalisingly, is a doppelgänger for Audrey Hepburn. Consequently Haynes and Lachman are compelled to hold the camera, long and sure on her utterly beguiling features. Blanchett, by contrast, can only be described as both handsome and regal.So, the story unfolds as an elder socialite, Carol, totally disgusted with her affluent but corporate married life, and a dark past as a - whisper it because the word could not be uttered in McCarthy's 1950's USA - lesbian, sets eye on the virginal Mara in a pre- Christmas department store. The impact on both is immediate. The sexual tension starts from that very first moment and builds and builds until finally consummated in a Motel room in the midst of a Thelma and Louise-esque road trip (albeit one that's driven at a much slower pace).This 'forbidden' love comes with significant baggage; Blanchett's estranged husband spots it soon enough and uses their 4 year old daughter as a ransom for her to return to the familial home. This destroys Blanchett and makes the illicit relationship impossible to maintain. It's a beautiful celebration of love; what little sex the film contains - with an OTT BBFC statement that it contains infrequent strong sex - is both tasteful and genuinely loving.Really it's hard to unpick the complex and symbiotic relationship that these two women have forged on screen. One performance could not exist without the other and it is to Haynes' extreme credit that he keeps a hold on it all and guides it effortlessly into the land of classic cinema.Go see it before it's too late.",Carol
97,James_De_Bello,8/10,8,5 January 2016,"One of the best movies of the year. An enchanting love story with actual deepness and heartfelt emotion that focuses on telling a story and not just pulling on the heartstrings just for the sake of it as many dramas of this kind tend to do.We have seen gay ""prohibited"" love stories before, many of those films just fall into melodrama and boredom because they just focus on the problematic of freedom and completely forget the characters in the first place. What Carol does is using that ""prohibited"" aspect of the story as a background. It is never fully mentioned or explored in the film, it is just there and we all know it is there. By trusting the audience with that and not banging you over the head with morality lesson, the filmmakers manage to achieve some of the best sexual tension I have ever experienced in a film. Believe me there were times where I just had to look away from the screen to catch my breath. It was that effective.There is a fascinating look at seduction and instinctual love, and I am talking in general not even in the context of a gay 1950s story. Those scenes where Rooney Mara and Cate Blanchett just go on for five minutes in a room alone were a treasure that culminated in one of the best sex scenes I have seen in modern cinema. A sex scene that actually evokes emotion and tell something really interesting about the characters.Now again all of this works thanks to how the filmmakers decide to tell this story, but also thanks to two brilliantly utilized film ingredients: the score and the photography. The score is one of year's very best, and that's saying something since this year we were graced with endless good scores, but it is really used as a storytelling tool that makes the love story work emotionally even more thanks to how it is placed throughout. The photography also, because it uses close ups to really get intimate with the characters and ultimately make those scenes work at their best.The best has yet to come however. Rooney Mara in this film is the reason why I love cinema and acting. She is so good in the film that I just wanted to go there and give her a kiss to thank her for such a flawlessly involving performance. Cate Blanchett is magnetic of course, but she isn't as deeply fascinating as Mara is. She has a scene in the film, in a train, which melted my heart in sadness. Fantastic work.I have to admit that I am not yet clear on how much I really liked the film. I would really love to watch it another time very soon. I may think that this is due to the fact that those scenes with Mara or Mara and Blanchett together were so good that the rest of the film didn't really follow through. The second half becomes pretty straightforward until the absorbing conclusion, but it just lacks the thematic undertones that were so relevant and touching in the first half.Anyways, this is a very emotional and mature piece, a fantastic portrayal of a love story that puts its characters and story first and doesn't worry about Oscar bait stuff and Oscar scenes and also a very inspiring movie for screen writing and direction.",Carol
98,scottshak_111,An alluring take on same-gender love!,8,10 March 2016,"Carol isn't just a self-exploration sojourn of Therese Belivet; it is so much more. With an enchanting screenplay to keep us company, Carol walks with a constant finesse depicting human emotions in a beautiful way. You can't help but feel for the characters as they carry the right gusto in their acts.Rooney Mara is simply outstanding. She carries a face of innocence that reads confusion quite often, whilst trying to learn the ways of her character. Coming to her aid is the voluptuous Carol Aird played by Cate Blanchett, whose life is torn apart owing to an ongoing divorce scene that hurls her into fits of melancholia.SPOILERS: The way Todd Haynes traverses the camera from a gutter to a third person perspective by capturing the rattling and chugging of a train in the backdrop, to reach the protagonists having a conversation on a table speaks volume of his sheer genius. Right there the prologue gets painted, and memories gush in from the past through the mist of the car window, as Therese Belivet (Rooney Mara) gawks at the city, being indifferent to the talks of the mundane.It is a beautiful way of depicting movie frames which Haynes seems to have mastered. He nails them like a pro. Complements Todd brilliantly in the background with an enthralling profound score is Carter Burwell, whose music is placed at right scenes, to make you feel the flick's endearing rhythm.""My angel, flung out of space."" Love has so many forms. It goes beyond age and sex, and Patricia Highsmith's story couldn't cover it better. With a genius like Todd to help us crawl alongside the frames, the movie forever stays in empathetic waters. With spectacular performances by Cate and Rooney, the movie reaches a pinnacle of emotions. Little things, like when Therese notices minute details in Carol whilst she drives, and when she shows up eventually with a quivering heart hoping that she would see her are all brilliantly shot.The movie's drama at times misses on milking Carol's love for Therese. Her life's atrocities fail to cash in on the love she feels for Therese, and that's where the flick appears to have dwindled. But still Haynes manages to keep the juices flowing and what we have in the end is a magnificent project in melodrama.Highly recommended!",Carol
99,shawneofthedead,"A masterpiece that's tough, tender and thoughtful, anchored by a love story for the ages.",9,4 December 2015,"These days, it's hard to be surprised by a love story in a film. There shouldn't even be much of a surprise to the love story that forms the heart and soul of CAROL – anyone who walks into the cinema will know that this is The Movie In Which Cate Blanchett And Rooney Mara Play Lesbians. And yet, Todd Haynes' masterful, intoxicating film unfolds in a series of small, subtle surprises, culminating in one of the most profoundly affecting romances ever committed to film.New York, in the early 1950s. Therese (Mara) is working as a shopgirl in the toy section of a department store. She meets and serves dozens of people, but only one catches her eye: Carol (Blanchett), a poised, polished and seemingly perfect example of the many wives and mothers who frequent the store. On Therese's recommendation, Carol buys a model train set for her daughter Rindy: an unusual Christmas present for a little girl that swiftly draws a connection between the two women.Over the next hour, CAROL shades colour and complexity into the world in which Carol and Therese live. When they find each other again through a pair of gloves misplaced by accident (or, perhaps, design), the two women share lunch, and a tune played on a piano. Carol invites Therese to her family home and, eventually, on a road trip that changes everything. Therese confesses her love of photography, and begins to ask awkward questions of Richard (Jake Lacy), her devoted, if somewhat callous, boyfriend. Through it all, Carol's marriage to Harge (Kyle Chandler) crumbles apart, despite the fierce love they share for their daughter. For much of its running time, Haynes' film – an adaptation of Patricia Highsmith's groundbreaking second novel, The Price Of Salt – unfolds at a deliberately unhurried pace that might alienate some, and bore others. Dramatic outbursts are kept to a bare minimum, chiefly coming from a raging Harge as he tries ever more desperately to cajole (or bully) Carol into remaining by his side. The growing tenderness between Carol and Therese deepens, not through flowery confessions of undying love, but in the exchanging of tentative glimpses, glances and smiles. And yet, the heartbreaking magic woven throughout CAROL comes from precisely these understated, measured moments. The aching, all- consuming affection between Carol and Therese blossoms in the film's pockets of silence, as they study each other in a mirror, or share a conspiratorial smile over breakfast. Threats of death and danger surface, but in purely emotional terms, resonating all the more powerfully for never being literal. Indeed, it's only when the film slips into its devastating final act – which simultaneously manages to warm hearts and shatter souls – that one begins to realise just how bewitching a spell CAROL has cast in the silences and in-betweens.To top it all off, there is so much at work in Phyllis Nagy's wonderfully spare script that CAROL practically begs to be excavated, pored over and studied at length. The love story at its heart works because CAROL is a film about two women who are making their way towards each other through a world that often refuses to understand, accept or acknowledge them: not just as potential lovers, but also as people. Entire novels can be written about the film's excellent feminist and queer credentials, particularly when it comes to shining a spotlight on its women and their relationships (including a powerful supporting turn by Sarah Paulson as Abby, Carol's best friend and erstwhile paramour). It seems profoundly unnecessary to say that CAROL's trump card is Blanchett. It should be self-evident, a given – after all, for as long as she has made movies, she has unquestionably been the best thing about any film she's in. And yet, she is completely transcendent here. In Blanchett's hands, Carol manages to be unearthly – an exalted goddess on a pedestal – and utterly, completely human at the same time. In a wonderfully layered final scene with Harge, Carol's controlled composure cracks apart, revealing the punishing depth of the pain she must undergo in order to be true to herself. Blanchett conveys it all with heartbreak to spare, radiating love, joy, misery or despair with barely perceptible changes in expression.Mara, meanwhile, gives her finest performance to date. Her Therese lingers quietly at the edges of her own life, not so much pushing limits as slipping past them to find her own way. It's hard to shake the feeling, though, that Mara remains outclassed by her co-star. Unlike Carol, Therese never completely coalesces as a character in her own right. To be fair to Mara, that's partly due to one of the script's few flaws. In a film that is otherwise so subtle and considered, we are too often told rather than shown that Carol finds Therese irresistible. (There is no such problem in believing that anyone could fall head over heels for Carol.) Nevertheless, the chemistry between Blanchett and Mara burns, slowly but brightly. The electricity between them throws off more sparks as the film goes on – to the point that audiences will find their hearts stuttering and stopping at the tiniest of moments: when Carol presses her hand lightly on Therese's shoulder, or when their eyes meet, finally, across a crowded room.In all of these elements, and in ways big and small, CAROL constantly surprises. It could have been ripely melodramatic; instead, it lingers in a key of melancholy realism. In another universe, Carol might have been more manipulative, Harge more villainous, Therese more coquettish, the love story less compelling and more titillating. The film's themes could have overwhelmed its central romance. And yet, in every gorgeous frame (composed with impeccable grace by cinematographer Edward Lachman), CAROL sings of its love story: one that is as sweet as it is bitter, as simple as it is complex, and as real as it is magical.",Carol

101,The_late_Buddy_Ryan,Got a 10-minute standing O at Cannes. Surprise twist: it's a great movie!,9,31 March 2016,"Gorgeous, powerful and touching film, adapted from an early novel, ""The Price of Salt,"" by Patricia Highsmith. Up till now, I'd only known her as the creator of coldblooded suspense yarns like ""Strangers on a Train"" and the Ripleyad, so I didn't see this one coming at all. ""Salt"" is partly based on her own experience as the 19-year-old lover of a glamorous socialite and, years later, as a clerk in Bloomingdale's toy department who fantasized about (and briefly stalked) a ""blondish woman in a fur coat"" she'd sold a doll to. Don't know how much Phyllis Nagy's Oscar-nom'd adaptation has retrofitted the script to comport with current values, but it certainly works.Cate Blanchett and Rooney Mara fully inhabit their characters: Cate's her usual creamy, catlike self as Carol, an elegant soon-to-be divorcée, and Rooney Mara's perfect as Therese, a quiet, self-contained young woman who's been drifting through life, ""saying yes to everything."" (The scene where she wonders out loud to her bemused boyfriend if it's possible for a boy (sic) to fall in love with another boy ""right out of the blue"" is priceless.) Suspense was Highsmith's default setting, so it's no surprise that this tender love story quickly evolves into a ""They Drive by Night""-style road film, culminating in a noirish incident she borrowed from her ex-lover's divorce case.I'm a hetero male with only the dimmest memories of Ike's first term, but the period atmosphere--from the thick wool topcoats to the omnipresent ciggies--seems totally convincing, much more so than in ""Far from Heaven,"" IMHO. (I should mention that male viewers who have a problem seeing members of their sex portrayed as oppressive bullies and clueless bystanders may not get much out of this one. It passes the Bechdel test with flying colors!) Great soundtrack--not the usual cavalcade of random greatest hits. Good work by Kyle Chandler, playing against type as Carol's vindictive husband, and Sarah Paulson as Carol's ex.",Carol

Therese starts to fall in love with carol despite being involved with Richard even though he is more of a friend than actual boyfriend. Meanwhile carol is going through a struggle of her own while dealing with the divorce of her husband while also having to worry about a custody battle of her daughter as well, what made this movie rather touching for me was how Therese started to come out of her shell and open up while carol gains confidence in herself. What makes it even more powerful is the advertisy that the ladies faced and managed to come out strong.",Carol
103,themadmovieman,Simply fabulous,7,19 November 2015,"This is an absolutely wonderful film, which features some incredible directing and acting as well as a generally compelling plot that manages to avoid all of your expectations and provide a story that's really quite different.In effect, the plot is about the romance between two women, and how, in the 1950s, that could go down so badly amongst society, but where this film's genius lies is in its ability to show this story not in the normal 'taboo' way, but actually just as a standard romance, where it's the main characters' love that is strongest instead of the ways in which society views them.As a result, you get a wonderful love story right the way through, but it's still not one without high drama. The inner conflict of Rooney Mara's young character is fascinating to watch, whilst Cate Blanchett's character engages in a fierce legal battle with her husband throughout, adding an extra level of emotional intrigue, and preventing this from becoming too much of a run-of-the-mill romantic drama.In general, you get an absolutely fascinating plot with this film, and although you could say that the opening phase is a little bit sluggish in establishing the characters and the main romance (although the general pace of the whole film is very patient), it's easy to get really engrossed in this story.Beyond the plot, the performances here are very strong too. Rooney Mara is excellent in the role of a young woman finding herself overcome with unexpected emotions, but it's still Cate Blanchett that steals the show. Although Mara plays the main character, Blanchett's presentation of Carol, the older, sophisticated woman, is pretty astonishing.You can tell with this performance that she's an actress right at the top of her game, because every time she appears in any scene, she completely dominates, showing off all her amazing talent to the full, and although this arguably isn't as clearly impressive a performance as Blue Jasmine, the way she turns Carol into this illusive woman who so easily becomes the object of the younger woman's affection, is fantastic.Finally, it has to be said that this is one of the most aesthetically pleasing film you'll see all year. Todd Haynes' direction is fabulous, and, along with the beautiful costume and production design, he does such an excellent job of creating this cosy world in 1950s New York that makes this such a pleasant story, as well as taking some interesting choices over the cinematography. It seems that in most scenes, all the characters appear very neatly off-centre, which is just a small touch, but brilliant attention to detail, that got to me and made me love looking at this beautiful film even more.",Carol
104,kaptenvideo-89875,1950's postcard USA.,6,4 December 2016,"1950's postcard USA. The wife is gay and finds love with pretty young girl. Husband doesn't approve and means to take the custody of their daughter. Starring Cate Blanchett and Rooney Mara. ""Carol"" is a major critic darling, even more so than 2002's ""Far from Heaven"", director Todd Haynes's similar and also highly acclaimed drama. This time, he didn't write this, only directing a story based on seminal Patricia Highsmith novel.I understand why it's an important message movie and quality work in every aspect. I just didn't click with it personally. Perhaps I do not have the taste for this kind of beautifully stylish but emotionally detached approach. It didn't work for me in ""Far from Heaven"" as well.The performances are good but the power of the drama lies mostly in direction mixing American imagery with decidedly un-Hollywood approach which favors restrained characters and subtle details over going big and provokingly dramatic. Despite being much loved by critics, the movie didn't win any of the 8 BAFTAs, 6 Academy Awards or 5 Golden Globes it was nominated for. This would be kind of weird if one didn't notice that on some level the movie is more about majestic mosaic of director's vision of 1950's USA than two main characters who fill the screen almost constantly. They are like vivid puppets in grand-scale orchestration which may explain why actresses are not scoring big on this project. This movie is not as much about flexing that good old acting muscle than one would expect.The real conundrum for me here is the rising star Rooney Mara who got her second Academy Award and Globe nominations for this role. (The first pair came from 2011's ""The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo"".)I don't understand her appeal. She's OK but why do people think so highly of her acting? I've seen her in 9 movies by now, including two mentioned just above, and I just don't get it. She's like a less lively Zooey Deschanel.Don't mean to be hating, just wondering aloud. Always have liked her sister Kate Mara though!",Carol
105,luke-a-mcgowan,A soaring and tasteful romance with spectacular performances,8,29 February 2016,"You can tell that Carol was directed by a gay man. Its tasteful, with even the love scenes devoid of the eroticism that some directors might have resorted to. Haynes makes sure that every point of contact between Therese and Carol is building their romance, almost like they're falling in love through touch. Carol places her hands on Therese's shoulders and we see Therese blush. There's a hand clutch as a sign of comfort. They smell each other's perfume and linger in each other's personal space just a little too long. You can feel their aching loneliness expressed in their physical contact and as they passionately embrace you can see them enveloping themselves in each other. Their conversations flow just at the right pace for their romance - both characters feel fully realised and neither seems unreasonable in their dependence on the other. You can see Haynes' skill even in something as simple as the way Mara and Blanchett hold their cigarettes - Mara holds hers nervously while Blanchett holds it like a queen, and by the end of the film Mara has more confidence and holds hers with a kind of unapologetic statement. Sandy Powell's beautiful costumes are likely the best of the year, especially Carol's beautiful big coat and Therese's colour bland colour pallet with Santa hat. The deep red (Carol's signature colour) of Therese' dress late in the film as Carol sees her from afar implies that part of Carol has rubbed off on Therese. The cinematography captures the first glance Therese has of Carol without resorting to the cheap ""people are there and then suddenly they're not"" wipe cut of every movie ever. Carter Burwell's gorgeously warm, soaring score captures all of the romance, light and despondence of this film in its strings and woodwind. It is reminiscent of early Harry Potter films.Blanchett and Mara's dual performances are utterly spectacular. Blanchett's rich voice and powerfully classy exterior barely mask the fragility underneath, of anger and bitterness and sadness and hurt. Her vulnerability in the final conversation with Therese is palpable, and the scene in the lawyer's negotiations is worthy of an Oscar nomination in its own right. Rooney Mara owns the entire movie with her spectacular work. You can see things that she wants to say written clearly on her face. Her awkwardness around her boyfriend and open chemistry with Carol are magnificent. You can see when she's shaken and when she's finally able to smile with Carol of all people. Her tearful monologue about ""I always say yes"" is the best scene in the film.Kyle Chandler is excellent as Harge, Carol's soon to be ex-husband. There's an instant lack of positive energy with Blanchett, and the disconnect in their conversations are clever. The jealousy bubbles on the surface of his whole hunched body. For negatives, Carol is not as trim as it could be. Therese's boyfriend exists as little more than a one-dimensional obstacle. Sarah Paulson's character is undeveloped, especially apparent in a scene where Therese asks why Abby hates her. I was so busy saying ""where did that come from?"" that I barely comprehended that Abby was saying the same thing. These are all things that could have been trimmed.But to finish on a positive, Carol opens with a beautifully directed scene in which we follow a man named Jack into the building and he runs into Therese. We can tell from the way Rooney Mara jolts and turns around that we've interrupted something important. Later in the movie, when we revisit this scene, I was completely awed by how accurate my hunch was.",Carol
106,FallenEye,"Boo, in a Time Too, Taboo.",7,23 October 2016,"The first hour of this film is perhaps, emotional foreplay. Though to some extent, it is sensual, it also is however, a bit slow, or maybe, sedate.With that said though, Cate Blanchett is awe-inspiring, and a true veteran in front of the camera. It's because of her ability - to stimulate your readiness to take this journey with Carol, that carries the film to the end.Rooney Mara plays her part too, and very well at that, however, Cate is who brings it to the finish line.Carol is a simple love story, complicated by its time, its nature and Carol's emotional luggage. It's just two people, one trying to define herself, while the other, trying to find herself, but both are able to feel that, the answer they're looking for, is in each other.Carter Burwell offers a gentle and fitting composition, as a backdrop to a tender relationship and Todd Haynes, though he did a fairly good job, was fortunate to be working with such a talent as, Cate Blanchett.",Carol
107,wilvram,An enchanting love story,10,19 December 2015,"From the start, I was struck by the skill, accuracy, and attention to detail in which the period setting of the early 1950s was evoked, conspicuously lacking in those jarring anomalies which so many productions set in past eras are prone. The costumes, and what used to be referred to as the art direction, are immaculate.There's the pitch-perfect performances of Cate Blanchett and Rooney Mara, the latter whom I'd not seen before, both impeccably cast and utterly believable. This is not a film that relies on frequent twists and turns of the plot, but on the developing emotional relationship between the two characters, which I found thoroughly gripping, and at times, very moving. In the first half, Blanchett's Carol is a somewhat enigmatic figure, seen mainly through the eyes of Mara's Therese, while later she is treated much more objectively. I thought Abby, Carol's childhood friend, and then lover, played by Sarah Paulson, bore a resemblance to the original author, Patricia Highsmith; I wonder if this was intentional? I think everyone involved in the making of this can feel justifiably proud.",Carol
108,Jerghal,A rather typical Oscar film,6,28 February 2016,6 Oscar nominations is way to much for this rather mediocre picture. Production wise everything is top notch but the story is so mundane and straightforward. The movie just hobbles along without anything out of the ordinary happening. Kate Blanchett is excellent though somewhat typecast as the good looking older classy lady while Rooney Mara plays the innocent and somewhat naive girl. Rooney Mara does have a lack of charisma and rather few facial expressions. This was OK and fitting for the character of Lisbeth in Girl with the Dragon Tattoo but not for an emotional movie like this. If it wasn't for the Oscars I've would have skipped it completely and I suggest you might do the same.,Carol
109,CineCritic2517,Terribly slow and predictable drama,1,19 October 2015,"Mara plays Therese who falls in love with a much older woman played by Blanchet in 1950s New York. From the onset, the film appears to be crippled as it barely gains speed during the first and second act. Blanchet's acting felt laboured throughout and Mara fared little better. Had two lesser known actors been cast for the main roles, the film might have been a bit more interesting as both Mara and Blanchet turn in nothing you haven't seen before from them.The problems of the movie are simply a lack of story progression and turns of events. The film just kind of plods on for 2 hours and then ends, without offering the viewer anything other than pretty sets and a predictable script. The story itself is just way too thin to really hold one's attention.5/10",Carol
110,mattiasflgrtll6,"""I miss you... I miss you...""",10,29 December 2015,"Finally. FINALLY. This is the movie which completely overwhelmed my expectations and blew me away.Romance is actually one of my favorite genres, but unfortunately it has let me down a lot more than once. Not the case with Carol. This has a strong possibility of being the best movie of 2015.Therese is a woman working in a store who has an interest in trains and photography. But her hobbies is not enough to escape her boring and quite uneventful life. Carol has a wonderful daughter and is doing fine financially... but has an husband (whom she is trying to divorce) who won't leave her alone and makes her feel miserable.These two people meet, and... they connect.First off, the story itself is already incredibly captivating. It takes place during a time period where homosexuality was not only frowned upon, but there were even laws against it. So seeing the two of them facing struggles in order to keep in contact with each other is fascinating to behold. And it is because the love story is so damn beautiful. There is a lot of visual language. Eye contact and body language often speaks for itself. And it's excellently executed, as you sometimes know exactly how these two character are feeling without a single word spoken. And even the dialogue itself has subtlety to it. There are plenty of times where either Carol or Therese insinuate feelings by using seemingly casual sentences. ""Your perfume... it smells good."" is really just a synonym for ""I want to kiss you"". ""Oh stop it, you look perfect!"" can very well mean ""I want to spend the rest of my life with you."" The lines are not obvious giveaways and I love it. The audience gets to think for themselves.But what really makes this movie work is the acting. It's absolutely amazing. Cate Blanchett and Rooney Mara are at their best ever. They make the characters so real, so human, that you wish they actually existed. Kyle Chandler also throws in a remarkable performance as the husband. You root for the two girls... but you don't hate Harge either. There is one scene where he has gone so far as to get himself to the house Carol and Therese is staying at for the weekend. And when he's told he can't have her, I was really feeling bad for the guy!I can't remember the last time I have been as touched by a movie. It hit my heart just in the right places, and when I walked out of the theater I felt like I had just experienced someone else's life.Okay, the trailer revealed too goddamn much from the movie, so several important plot details I already knew beforehand. But even that couldn't stop the perfectly orchestrated ocean of emotions it bathed me in. Carol will stick to your brain like glue after you've watched it. Oh and the movie too ;)",Carol
111,dakjets,Above average thanks to Cate Blanchett,6,19 July 2016,"I recently saw this film, although I'm not so keen on drama. I saw the movie first and foremost because Cate Blanchett plays in it. She is one of my favorites, I've never seen her in a bad movie. Nor in this film. Cate holds her ground here too. In fact I would argue that it is she who keeps this film going and that it works. Her presence and acting saves this somewhat stagnant drama. For it does not happen so much. Especially the scenes between the two female leading roles are long, and too unclear, in my view. The story is the basically important and strong. Two women who find each other, at a time when homosexuality is illegal and gay rights is very weak. But I've seen this been conveyed far better in other films, such as in the English film Maurice. The film is not bad, but without Cate it would have been boring. Her strong presence, also makes this film becomes OK, or good. Although far from her best.",Carol

Sometimes you just don't get around to some films and then they fade in interest. I have little to offer from other reviews. It's a beautiful production in nearly every capacity and the acting by the two leads is very fine. For a forbidden love story it is very reserved and I suppose that fits in with the era that it takes place in (the early 1950's), but for me it was also its main flaw. I didn't feel the passion they had for each other and far too many scenes of them staring into each other's eyes didn't quite compensate for that. Still, I again have to say that it's an honest stance for this era. Certainly not for everyone as it's very slow moving, but it's a must for serious cinema lovers.",Carol
114,robsta23,"Good Romance, Overly Dramatic at Points",8,24 January 2016,"Carol touches on the idea that love can be a difficult concept to grasp and may cause confusion to those who aren't certain about their sexuality. It's a great topic to look into; if only certain points of the movie were more subtle about it than having Mara's character try to beat around the bush asking her almost boyfriend if he's ever loved a boy.We begin by seeing Therese and Carol talking in a lobby when Therese is spotted by an old friend who asks her if she is attending a party. Therese goes with the friend while reflecting on Carol, sending us into the past to the events right before Therese and Carol meet. When Therese spots Carol for the first time in the store where she works, it seems very similar to the notion of the male gaze often found in narrative cinema. There is a clear interest in the figure before Therese gets distracted, but they of course meet a few moments later. They aren't necessarily flirting, but they are two people with a connection, and perhaps that's what love is - as long as the connection is strong enough.Kyle Chandler as Carol's husband Harge (his name is Harge?) is the closest thing to an antagonist in this film, and this role is somewhat strange. At first it seems that he feels Carol is evil because she is a lesbian who won't come out and say it, but you have to put into context that he's the father of her child, and by seeing other people (women or not) she is damaging the relationship she has with her husband, a relationship that would affect the child. What seems to be overly dramatic is the fact that he doesn't think she is fit to have joint custody simply due to these lies she is trying to cover up. Carol is a struggling lesbian in a time well before anybody like her would be accepted, and because of this she has to be condemned? This film is partially about the struggles of the LGBT community, but that allegation seems too dramatic considering the actual circumstances within the film.This film is definitely well-acted by both Mara and Blanchett. Both leads have their own internal struggles with who they are and what love really means. Mara's playing her character as shy and fragile is top notch while Blanchett shines as being confident but overwhelmed and sometimes heart-broken by the results of her actions. If you don't mind sex, Carol is not really that heavy with ""bad"" content for an R- rated movie. This film is easy to watch and explores great issues, but at certain points comes across as cheesy or tries too hard to be dramatic.3.0/4.0",Carol

When Cate's emotional guard, and the veneer of '50s sophistication slips, she's superb. We see more of Mara's back-story, and the narrative is far more tilted toward her than it is the titular big-name, which allows her the opportunity to develop a more emotionally honest and credible characterisation.

With Cate Blanchett (Carol) and Rooney Mara (Therese) stepping outside of their perceived non-gay comfort zones, this film is all the buzz. However, while Haye's perfectly captures the era in question with the use of antique film quality, and filling the environment with vintage cars, costumes, props and music, Phyllis Nagy's (dir./writer ""Mrs. Harris""- 2005) slow moving screenplay, filled primarily with glances and glares, hinders any desire to stay with the love affair.

The relationship between Carol and Terese begins slowly but then really blossoms into something deep and meaningful. Cate Blanchett as always is amazing you see her luminous quality as her acting is so effortless. She has a great chemistry with Rooney Mara and they play off each other really well.

It's a drama, a homosexual love story, with two great performances from Rooney Mara and Cate Blanchett, who never disappoint me. She is always so fragile and powerful. Moreover, it's a bittersweet film, sometimes a little bit boring, that it captures the era perfectly.

One is naive and the other is quite sophisticated. And yet, there is an undeniable mutual attraction that they feel for each other. The movie is shot with such nuance that it's a sheer pleasure to watch. Cate Blanchett and Rooney Mara, are incredibly gorgeous and talented actresses. The film captures their beauty and craft in an effortless manner. Their subtle and sincere portrayal of two people in love is quite effective. Every time their eyes meet in the movie, own can feel the palpable connection between the two.Carol is a desperate woman who is in an unhappy marriage, fearful of losing the custody of her daughter, while Therese (with an Audrey Hepburn kind of look, or is it just me?) has a job that she dislikes and a relationship that is unsatisfying. As the movie proceeds, we see how these unhappy people provide each other with a perfect partner. Carol gifts Therese a camera and a muse which allows her to pursue her long-cherished dream of becoming a photographer. Therese, in her gentle, innocent and non-pushy way, lets Carol gather her thoughts and take control of her life. However, the circumstances are piled against them. The world in 1950s wasn't so ready to understand that love comes in all forms. This movie is thus a very gentle reminder of how difficult it must have been for some people to be able to spend their lives with who they truly loved.A deeply sensitive and moving portrayal of how love is one of the most basic of emotions, and how it could not and would not be denied!",Carol

The production value is refreshing for this kind of movie which is usually reserved for more traditional love stories not those between two women in different stages of their life both forced to chose between security and passion. Cate Blanchett and Rooney Mara are of course spectacular. Sarah Paulson plays supporting but important roll. Kyle Chandler who played Cate Blanchett's on screen husband could have been written as a villain but instead he is written as a confused and bitter man lashing out at a woman who never loved him. And for fans of ""Gotham"" there is Cory Michael Smith who plays a small but pivotal roll. This is not an action movie by any definition of the word. It is slow and precise in its storytelling.

She definitely made this film the gorgeous piece of work it is. Her performance in this film is absolutely stunning. I was a little hesitant on watching this film at first because I thought it was going to be a dry boring drama but because I am a fan of Cate Blanchett I decided to see it and I'm glad I did. Along with the stunning performance of Cate Blanchett, Rooney Mara was great as Carol's (Cate Blacnchett) little naive love interest and I also enjoyed the performance of Sarah Paulson who played Abby Gerhard, the ex and good friend of Carol (Cate Blanchett). The story line of this film is quite simple, Therese Belivet (Rooney Mara), a young naïve photographer, falls for a mesmerizing and gorgeous woman. I read some reviews on this site and some others saying that this film wasn't good because of the lesbian relationship that's in this film. Personally, I don't condone homosexuality but that doesn't have anything to do with how I saw this film. Everything about this film was great, the cast, their performances, the costume design and the setting. I think this film should have gotten at least one Oscar. All and all this is a great film mainly because of the performance of Cate Blanchett. It wouldn't have been anything without her.",Carol
122,dale-51649,Ageing creepy rich lady falls for younger selfish bimbo; maudlin and anachronistic,5,15 January 2017,"The film is about a wealthy older woman who falls for a cute department store clerk girl. It is set in the 1950s, and although the physical sets are accurate, there is a lot of revisionist history in the story line.Did you ever observe characters in films who have every opportunity to be happy, yet seem to somehow be dramatically miserable? You just have a hard time feeling sorry for them.The older gal played by Cate Blanchette has a young daughter, and there are many references to how miraculous the child is. The fawning and consideration they give the child is nothing like the way kids were viewed and treated back then. It would have been more authentic if they had portrayed the parent kid relationship the way it was, where kids did as they were told and the world was for the adults. It would have segwayed better when Blanchette went all Kramer vs. Kramer and ran out on the kid too. People didn't fawn over kids back then the way they do now.Blanchett is great at being aloof, and and in that way she was born to play this role. She is well dressed and well healed, and plays a nose in the air snob so well it's scary.
Speaking of scary, when she meets the shop gal she immediately stalks her in a way that in real life would freak anybody out-YIKES!!! Good thing she's not a man, or they would have plucked her off the street and thrown her in a dark cell for the same stalkyness. Mora wasnt underaged , but they would use that whole ""power dynamic line"" to jail a guy for the same game.She is also married to a rich guy with movie star good looks, buys her a tutor mansion, is a great father and is madly in love with her. Yet, she is unhappy, not so much because she should be, but because she can be. It is unclear if Blanchett's wealth is from hubby or family money, but either way she certainly didn't make it herself. Her lifestyle of luxury and self pity are only practical if some guy is off making the moneyThe shop girl Rooney Mara is cute , but not too bright. She has a nice guy in love with her too, and other than a special needs type fascination with toy trains she has nothing to offer the world but a cute bod and perpetual dear in head lights stare. Oh yea, she is unhappy too, complaining constantly about always doing what others want her to do, yet we never see an example of what the hell she is talking about.The most interesting thing about the two gals is how totally worthlessthey both are. The shop girl basically works a job 99.9 percent of the population could do with absolutely no training, and Blanchett is never observed doing any work, AT ALL. If the world were filled with people like these two, it would collapse in a matter of hours because nobody would do anything expect worry about how unhappy they were, in spite of being handed EVERYTHING. ""OH , Aren't I fascinating? I am rich, good looking, kept, have guys chasing me, yet I am still unhappy-oh look at interesting me!!!!'I consider this film more of a mystery than a love story. You have a good looking young gal and a not too goofy looking rich older gal, both with love, money, options and yet they are still - UNHAPPY with a capital U. All they're anger is personified in the character played by Sara Paulson,who skulks through the film with an angry scowl so sour she could make a fortune if she could bottle it and sell it as a ""man repellent"". When Blanchett's husband tells Paulsonr he loves his wife as he is frantically looking for her, Paulson says-""I can't help you there"". Perfect line for the new Hollywood mantra-""Women and kids can do whatever they want, men don't matter"". The moral of the film is ""I can be as selfish as I want and if I break some guys hearts it doesn't matter, because the world revolves around ME.",Carol

The production values provide excellent atmospherics for the developing passion of Therese (Rooney Mara) and Carol (Cate Blanchett)---a reference to Violet Leduc, author of ""Therese and Isabelle?""

126,Genti23,Good but overrated,8,23 February 2016,"Carol is a romantic-drama film that's directed by Todd Haynes.The two main stars of the movie are Cate Blanchett as Carol and Rooney Mara as Therese Belivet. This movie is set in 1950s and it follows Carol and Therese who form a bond,after meeting in a department store,and they soon begin to fall in love with each other but that is followed by complicated consequences. I really did not think much of this movie,the stars do a pretty fine job especially Cate Blanchett but unfortunately I did not find Rooney Mara's performance to be nowhere near as good as some have suggested.Overall I would say this is an overrated movie that got a lot of buzz,which in my opinion came with the leading stars being female and the subject touching on the lesbian matter (and consequences of the time period that the movie takes place). The story became predictable by the end,the direction was not very good either simply because the way that the director chose to display this movie out has already been done before many times. However, I did love the score though,as it made some not-so-well made scenes have more weight to them and also gave the dialogue a little much needed punch.Also, the cinematography and the scenery is beautiful throughout as the 1950s come to life on the big screen in an amazing way. I was bored in some parts and also had quite a few issues but all in all this is a well made and good looking/well acted movie enough to get a pass as a GOOD movie (but not much else).",Carol

What makes this film almost unwatchable is Rooney Mara, who—like Dakota Johnson—seems to keep getting roles simply because her family is famous/wealthy. She cannot act at all, and it makes this film sink into the abyss of ""forgettability"". I saw the film for the story and Blanchett, and I have no idea why Mara was nominated for an Oscar. It's like Claire Danes winning all those Emmys despite being terrible in everything she does.

In this movie , her style is obvious in her clothes, in her voice , in her gait but there are no dialog or conversation. The movie is poorly edited . I did not enjoy the movie. Rooney Mara was good .

130,charles000,"Incredibly well crafted . . . I rarely give a 10, but for this, in a heartbeat",10,11 February 2016,"Incredibly well crafted . . . I rarely give a 10, but for this, in a heartbeat.So many other reviews have already stated in so many words what I would offer here, so I'll keep this brief, but hopefully informative.To start with, I could watch Kate Blanchett in just about anything, but here, she is absolutely spectacular. This may well be her best work ever, and I've seen most of it.That's not to take anything away from Rooney Mara, who was the perfect match for Kate's character in this film. Considering that her previous starring role was as the Lisbeth Salander character in ""the Girl with the Dragon Tattoo"", this is an excellent example of her range as an actress.As for the film itself, the attention to detail is superb. The artistry of the period piece is recreated in such a way that really teleports the viewer into that time, effortlessly.The story is, well . . . a love story, set against a difficult set of circumstances.Yes, it does revolve around the emergent lesbian relationship between the two main characters, but there's so much more to this.To categorize this as a ""gay"" movie would really be missing the point, and somewhat sidetracking the focus of this being a great example of filmcraft at its best.Whatever your interests or proclivities might be, the time spent to experience ""Carol"" should be well worth it.",Carol
131,RMurray847,A rare miss for Blanchett and a fairly tedious film all around.,5,11 January 2021,"I'm a big fan of Cate Blanchett, and have loved her in almost everything she does. Her ability to make a low-key character as credible as a high-energy character. Or to make a working class woman as believable as a wealthy and powerful women. She's great in pretty much anything, and I've bought movies knowing nothing about them except that they starred Cate Blanchett.I don't care for her too much in CAROL, and in fact, I don't care much for the film. I can accept a film that is quiet, where passions are banked and never allowed to burst into full flame (or at least, not often). But I don't actually want to be lulled to sleep by the film. But there are long stretches that are infuriating because they are a) slow paced & b) there doesn't really seem to be anything happening in the inner-lives of the characters either. CAROL takes the concept of meaningful glances or the exchange of smoldering looks to a degree where sometimes it feels that this is all the film is really about.Blanchett plays a bored wife (Carol) of a well-to-do man (Kyle Chandler) who is under something resembling occasional house-arrest for a ""romance"" she had with an old female friend (Sarah Paulsen). Essentially, she had an affair, one exacerbated by the fact that it took place with a woman (oh, did I mention, this is the early '50s). On one of her rare trips ""into the city"", Carol shops in the toy department of a big department store, and exchanges glances with the shopgirl (Rooney Mara) who helps her decide on a gift for her daughter. The scene clearly must mean something, because it goes on for a long time. Yet I never felt any passion stirring or smoldering or any HEAT. But Mara is clearly stricken by Blanchett, and when she realizes the lady has left a personal item behind on accident, she sends it back to Carol, and this small kindness leads to Mara spending more and more time with Carol. Apparently, they have the hots for each other, but we sure don't see it for the LOOONGEST time!I get it...in the '50s, feelings of desire for the same-sex were, shall we say, frowned upon and needed to be kept carefully hidden. But CAROL fumbles because it takes so much time avoiding anything coming to the surface even when the two women are alone together. Mara's character is conceived as a bit of a simpleton (in my mind). I suppose she's supposed to be naive and that these feelings are new to her (except they aren't, as we find out in scenes with her friendly but oblivious boyfriend). She seems somewhat out of touch with her own feelings. And occasionally she sounds like she's drunk...her speech slurs and her articulated thoughts meander.But Blanchett is the biggest miss here. I would have expected those relentlessly silent scenes, or the ones where characters talk about one thing when clearly they're thinking of something else, to have had more impact thanks to her ability to convey her inner life so well. She's done it before (NOTES ON A SCANDAL jumps to mind). But here she seems nearly vacuous. She seems to be striving towards a sensuousness that she's having to keep hidden...and she certainly keeps it hidden (I feel bad bashing her so much, but in my opinion, she is just simply not that good here.)The movie essentially follows the development of their relationship and also shows its impact on the lives of the men who love them. The ending is actually interesting and in some ways a bit surprising and unexpected. It might even have been stirring if only we cared one bit about these two characters.So why do I even give the film as many as 3 stars. Well, first of all, the production & costume design is impeccable. The toy department in which Mara works is a nostalgic delight (I wasn't alive then, but it just felt so completely RIGHT). Mara, despite my overall dislike of her character, has moments that are quite nice. The final 20 minutes or so of the film finally kick into a bit of a higher gear (thank goodness) and rescue it from complete forgetability.I know that this film just racked up some Oscar nominations, including for Blanchett. So clearly I am not in the majority regarding this film. But when a film is about PASSION, whether on open display or carefully hidden, I still need to feel that passion, either because it's openly represented, or clearly building beneath the surface. Instead, I'm left to infer what these characters are feeling, and if I don't care about them much, I'm not willing to make that kind of effort or investment. When the film was over, my wife and I discussed the film for awhile...we were both in agreement that it was not great, and so our discussion was about why the film was held in such high acclaim. We never settled on a definitive answer, because this is so subjective to start with. But in the end, I have to stick with my gut feelings...CAROL just doesn't work.",Carol
132,JackCerf,Wish It Had Been Better,6,11 January 2016,"A well-made, workmanlike disappointment, much inferior to Haynes's Far From Heaven. You knew where it was going and it went there. Along the way there are no surprises from the two lead characters. The most surprising thing, which lifts it above Lifetime territory, is that it does not villainize the male characters. They have the values of their time, to be sure, but the husband and the boyfriend mean well, while the detective and Carol's lawyer are both matter of factly professional. Her lawyer, in particular, does an excellent, nonjudgmental job with what looks like a hopeless case.The most erotic scene in the movie is not the consummation but rather the first lunch date, where Carol looks ready to swallow Therese alive and Therese seems ready to jump right down her throat. The imbalance of power in that scene is distasteful. As I grow older, I find that love stories of any gender between an older sophisticate and a young naif have either a predatory or a transactional vibe to them that puts me off. Throughout, Carol knows exactly what she wants and is cool and composed enough to wait for Therese to figure herself out, catch up and provide it. At its least exploitative, this kind of relationship is a bargain, where the elder provides education in return for rejuvenation. And since this is a Patricia Highsmith story, material concerns are part of the bargain. Carol's standard of living makes a powerful impression on Therese from the outset, and she quickly grows used to what it can provide By the end, Therese understands perfectly well who she is, and some other women can perceive it. But the ending, when Therese moves from a Greenwich Village party of impecunious young bohemians to join Carol for dinner at the Oak Room, is set up in such a way that we don't know whether Therese is opting for true love or for the bigger and better deal. I'm not sure Therese knows either. For what is supposed to be a story of amour fou, it isn't fou enough. The basic setup is Anna Karenina, but Harge isn't Karenin and nobody throws themselves under a locomotive. The ending is not quite a happy ending, more like happy enough given the circumstances. That may be real life, especially in the social circles of Carol and her husband, but, unlike Far From Heaven, there's no pathos here and no tragedy. I give it a B.",Carol
133,vsks,Carol does less than it should,7,18 January 2016,"Hailed as a top Oscar contender this year in numerous categories—best director, film, actress, and cinematography—Carol is the story of a wealthy but unhappily married woman (played by Cate Blanchett) who embarks on a relationship with a shopgirl (Rooney Mara) she meets by chance. Unquestionably, it's a period piece (nice Packards!), written by author Patricia Highsmith, herself a lesbian, who wrote high-class mysteries like The Talented Mr. Ripley, and it would have had considerably more shock value—and prompted more audience reflection—in its 1952 novel version, The Price of Salt. In a story set in that era and with the social class differences involved, there are lots of ways for this relationship to go wrong. Worse, with a husband willing to play his ace—custody of his and Carol's four-year-old daughter Rindy—the stakes are high. Yet, I didn't find this movie either engaging or revelatory. Of course Blanchett is terrific, as always, though even she may underplay the role of Carol through most of the film. Mara, as the initially childlike Therese Belivet, is so indeterminate that it's hard to root for her happiness (what would that require, exactly?) and even harder to see what the glamorous, sophisticated Carol sees in her. Perhaps director Todd Haynes and screenwriter Phyllis Nagy hoped that, by making Mara more or less a cipher, viewers would be free to pin their own romantic hopes and dreams on her. In the New York Times, critic A.O.Scott calls Carol ""a study in human magnetism, in the physics and optics of eros . . . (giving) emotional and philosophical weight to what might be a perfectly banal question: What do these women see each in each other."" That was my question, all right. Therese says she is almost will-less, that the complications in her life arise because all she ever does is say ""yes,"" and the film takes on the challenge of imbuing her most important affirmation with real meaning. In a season where we've seen so many excellent high-drama films, this one, to me, did less than I would have liked it to. I give it a B-.",Carol
134,pik923,what a disappointment,3,15 August 2017,"I gave it a 3 only because of Cate's performance - stunning as ever. However the script is as exciting as damp melba toast, as enthralling as a 3 day old cup of coffee and simply quite dull. Patricia Highsmith is a grand writer of a certain genre and era. Set this film against The Talented Mr. Ripley and you can see how bad the script is, how bad the director is and few if any directors male and female know how to direct an intimate film of love - love between two women especially. When we compare this film to The Hours - well there is no comparison. Or compare it to the German film, Aimee and Jaguar based on a true story set during the Holocaust - well again there is no comparison.All this money and talent that gets us nowhere. So they kiss - wow - big deal and they sleep together, or have sex or make love or whatever you want to call it - wow - that will get the reviewers attention and the audience in the theatre.but where is the love, where is the drama, where is the reason they like each other, are attracted to each other - what brings them together, rips them apart, etc etc etc - the emotional level of this film is about as intense as Johnny English (a comedy by the way).....The colorization, the cinematography the music are all good, and even exciting at some points, but really - what a disappointment. too bad - so much possibility with such a wealth of talent - how many people work on a film and the film to be a dud - let's be honest - that is what it is.....PS did they do this on purpose by directing the men in the film to be as bad as high school actors?

All the acting performances by the major players are worthy. This is a slow moving story but the performances keep you from straying. Not really a guy's movie. Years ago this movie would have shocked - not because of what you see on screen (very tame by today's standards), but the subject matter itself. I enjoyed this movie more because it doesn't concentrate on the sexual side of the relationship. It has more to do with the love between two people - in this case, two women.Cate looks absolutely stunning in almost every scene. Her style of acting through her visual expressions goes back to the Bette Davis and Joan Crawford era of acting. Stylish, classy and atmospheric.Also the attention to detail in this movie was first class. It's set in the early fifties, the clothing, the autos, the stores, restaurants, diners, motels etc etc - I was in awe of the artistic side of the movie too.The only reason I haven't given this movie a 10 rating is because I probably won't re-visit this movie for some years despite how good it is. But that's only because I know how the story ends. It really is worth seeing if the synopsis appeals to you. If I was able, I would give this movie a 9.5/10.

The last one was I'M NOT THERE and before that (nearly 13 years ago) was FAR FROM HEAVEN. CAROL is extremely reminiscent of FAR FROM HEAVEN. The obvious similarity is the plot involving a person coming to terms with their spouse's homosexual tendencies. However, there are other similarities: the 1950s setting, the deliberately slow pace, the stuffiness of East Coast society.I liked FAR FROM HEAVEN's atmosphere, much like classic Douglas Sirk films. CAROL seems to be lacking that and, for that fact, I think FAR FROM HEAVEN is the better film. All in all, CAROL is a suitable companion piece to FAR FROM HEAVEN.",Carol

138,stephanlinsenhoff,"Abby: ""Tell me ...",10,31 December 2015,"... what you're doing?"" ... and Carol answers: ""I don't. I never did."" Here she does - and learning it the hard way. In the behind-center is her daughter. When she finally has to choose she chooses her daughter, forced not by her husband but by society at large. It seems that she sacrifices her true nature, her lesbian nature, forcing herself to live what she never will be able to do - even with the help of therapy (as the author did. To afford the therapy aiming 'to be normal' Patricia Highsmith worked for some short Christmas-weeks at Bloomingdale/Frankenbergs. Here she met the real Carol, Mrs E. R. Senn. Be normal. She also tried an engagement. Her fiancé knew that she was lesbian. In the movie Therese is a short time engaged to Ralf, as Patricia Highsmith was... Who is the looser, who wins? In this story which repeats itself who ever is confronted by the ordeal of divorce? Not she, not he or them. We all are the instrument of a society that does not permit un-normality. Society is the looser. And Carol (loraC is a well known perfume!) gives her daughter as a gift for the future an example how the grown- up daughter can remember what her mother did when everything was at stake and she perhaps is in the same situation. For young Therese (she is not yet a mother - has not Carols experience) it is not easy to understand when reading Carols letter. By not following society's view of what is normal-not normal but forming as alternative a room of freedom in which Carol shows how and what to do in such a situation. Seeing her daughter as society-Harge wants it. Not wanting a warlike fight-back. But accepts the consequence-acceptance. The most precious Carol and Harge have is of course their daughter. Unworthy to fight in a warlike battle. By not fighting allows her a space of freedom: give the law what the law wants and you have every kind of freedom you want, need and wish. It is this Carol realized and put into practice. If Harge is not able to accept - which he did - will they meet in court. Like this both won - focused on the child. Their child. Therese, her ""angel flung out of space"". She is asked to come and meet Carol. To extend the happy ending for a moment Therese denies to move with Carol to the spacious flat for two. She leaves - - - only to return. Seeking with her eye Carols gaze they connect. Harge and Carol sold in the process of their divorce the house. She lives, as she tells Therese, in an apartment for two. For them. The author of the book was herself lesbian, broke up from an engagement. The real Carol Patricia Highsmith met when working at Bloomingdales for a short time where she met the real Carol. Inspired, she wrote the same evening an outcast of some pages. It was Kathleen Steen from New Jersey - married and two children. Depressed and heavily alcoholic she committed suicide in the garage Haloween 1951. Patricia Highsmith was unconscious of this. More information in this matter can be found in Andrew Wilsons book 'Beautiful shadow', 2003. When she saw Kathleen Steen at the department store she was already an active lesbian. Published 1984 - her choice of name was Claire Morgan. 24 may 1989 she published the book as 'The Price of Salt'. For 40 years she denied authorship (now after 60 years the movie). We all know that nothing is for free. Everything has its price. And must be payed. The not normal are well aware of it. Salt is need in our food. Not too much, not too little but: salt. The book closes with the authors own words, written 24 may 1989. The response of her book was huge. Many recognized themselves, thanking her for many years for her courage.The German DIE ZEIT's (Nr 51, 2015:59) critic of Carol is headed 'Das Ideal einer Affäre'. Is it really an ideal if we all know of the price of salt? Is it worth? It is! A fairytale tells of a king, asking his three daughters how they love him? More than: what? The youngest answer: more than salt. Everybody is chocked and the daughter is banned from the country. Soon salt is gone and the father understands what his daughter meant. Eventually she returns with a magic bag with salt to heal the sick, among them her father. Carol tried but could not, waiting for ... For what? Therese! For salt.Mihály Csikszentmihályi wrote 1990 the book 'Flow, The psychology of optimal experience.' Too much is stress, too little is boredom. Neither stress or boredom is flow. It is this experience the road movie Carol describes. The hard way. PS: While deciding, thinking and writing, having seen the movie 3/three times ...

I would conjecture this movie stands a good chance of garnering a bunch of Oskars at the upcoming 2016 Academy Awards Ceremony. It certainly deserves them.In summary it's a woman-woman love story.

City sidewalks and department stores are jammed with shoppers anxious to get their holiday shopping done. Carol (Cate Blanchett) is searching for a special doll for her young daughter in one of those large Manhattan department stores―the kind they had back in the 1950s with their polished marble floors, elevators stacked with shoppers, and elegant tea rooms. As she glances around, her eyes latch onto a young female clerk standing behind the doll counter. Like all the store clerks, she is wearing a large red stocking hat with a white ball on top and a furry white rim. Just like Santa's. The clerk returns Carol's glance with a look that says it all. I'm young. I'm hungry. Take me. Liberate me from this drudge life. And Carol takes it. She moves closer. In for the kill, so to speak. The doll in not in stock the clerk tells her. How about a toy train set for your daughter? Carol orders it, giving her name and address for delivery, and leaves. But not before conveniently forgetting her gloves.The gloves are returned, and Carol calls the department store asking for the clerk that returned them. Carol wants to thank her in person and asks if she could meet her for lunch. They meet in a swank mid-town restaurant. Full of confidence and not missing a beat Carol orders a super-deluxe sandwich and a dry martini with an olive. The clerk, nervous, orders the same thing. Carol asks her name. It's Therese Belivet (Rooney Mara). Carol asks discreetly, ""Therese? Not Theresa?"" Therese shakes her head shyly. No. Belivet is Czech, it turns out. Czech means her parents, or grandparents, emigrated to the US, and were probably blue-collar or small shopkeepers. She is as much in awe of Carol's parentage as she is of her beauty and sophistication. Soon Carol has Therese coming over to her large country house.What complicates Carol's seduction plan is her soon-to-be ex-husband, Harge Aird (Kyle Chandler). It's clear from comments Harge wants Carol to be the model executive's wife. Eye candy on his arm at the country club and social get-togethers. A patient wife who can endure his absences. But it's also clear Harge is still very much in love with Carol. He knew Carol had a previous affair with another woman who was a childhood friend, Abby Gerhard (Sarah Paulson). But he overlooked it. And he wants Carol back. Wants their life together again with their young daughter, Rindy (Sadie Heim/Kk Heim). And he doesn't understand why she's so adamant to live her life separately. He's frustrated with her, and his frustration boils over into anger and a desire for revenge. If he cannot have Carol, he will prevent her from keeping Rindy. But even in his uncomprehending frustration he doesn't strike her. He doesn't understand. Carol is a cougar. She wants to take on lovers. In her case young female lovers. And especially the one she has just met: Therese Belivet.Therese drinks with her friends at bars. Goes to her friends parties. Young people in their 20s struggling to establish their lives in an unforgiving world and to find a suitable mate to go along with them. But Therese is different. She wants more. She wants to abandon her plodding life in the underclass and sample the life of high society. Maybe even become a well-known and in-demand photographer. For this she needs connections. And along comes Carol Aird who drops out of the blue into her go-nowhere life like the good White Witch.The cougar and the kitten. Each has something to give and something to take. Carol has beauty, money, sophistication, and connections in high places. She will take Therese's love and admiration. Therese has youth and a young willing body. She will take Carol's love and the promise of a new lien on life. And maybe, just maybe, they will forge a stronger bond between each other that will last a lifetime.In one of the most poignant scenes in the movie in front of Harge, his attorney, and her attorney, Carol openly admits she has been a bad wife to Harge and has not reciprocated his love. But she pleads with him not to take their daughter away completely from her, for that would utterly destroy Rindy. Harge caves in. Carol wins the right to see her daughter but Rindy is to be left in Harge's custody. One can only wonder though what effect her parents' separation will have on Rindy as she grows up.

143,manders_steve,Beautiful and sensitive but doesn't explain why,6,23 January 2016,"This tells the tale of how early middle aged Carol Aird (Cate Blanchett), a soon to be divorced woman, falls in love with Therese Belivet (Rooney Mara), a much younger and less sophisticated shop assistant in 1950s New York. Based on Pamela Highsmith's novel The Price of Salt, it covers the awkward excitement of this fundamental human emotion, which just happens to be between two women, set against the strictures, mores and legal situation of the time.It is gorgeously set in wonderfully evocative period locations, beautifully filmed and captures the time and sense of place beautifully. Much has been said about the subtle sensitivity of both leads' performances, and while this is probably the case, somehow it didn't capture for me the why of what was unfolding – the film just expects you to accept that this is just the way it is. And that I think is the challenge of the film: somehow the character development just doesn't seem to even begin to answer the question ""Why are these two women feeling like this?"" We see the negative reasons underpinning why they may want to change away from their previous situations, but not the positive of why towards that which is portrayed, particularly given the challenges they know they will face. My wife commented that the film didn't add much to what we already knew from the publicity material and trailers we had seen before other films. The story line is really quite simple, and the lack of this depth of emotional rationale for me was where the film could have been much stronger.",Carol
144,barev-85094,Another waste of Cate Blanchett's talents -- booooooring!,5,23 December 2015,"CAROL, directed by Todd Haynes and starring Cate Blanchett was the prestige closing film of the Marrakesh Film Festival, on Dec. 12, 2015. Haynes is a respected Hollywood director noted for meticulous period detail and atmospheric reconstruction such as in his 2002 masterpiece, ""Far From Heaven"" which starred Julianne Moore in one of her greatest roles, also set in the fifties. This film, set in the same period with another great actress, looks like a clone of the earlier opus, but the cloning just doesn't take.While both the film and Cate look great all the way, unlike ""Heaven"" in which the supporting roles were also fully fleshed out and memorable (notably, her closet gay husband played by Dennis Quaid in his best role ever) here they are flat as pancakes and, worst of all, the central same-sex love relationship between Cate and void younger actress Rooney Mara has no tension, chemistry, reality, or anything else, which basically leaves the whole picture null and void -- reduced basically to an extended modeling session for Cate Blanchett, who looks better than ever draped in furs and perfectly becoming period apparel from beginning to end, not to mention a perfect blonde coiffure to enclose her perfect features. In the film Cate, who is obviously wealthy, drives a classy fifties Packard (at the time thought of as a more stately answer to the high end Cadillac) and fifties cars buffs will have a field day identifying the various other vintage models enriching the background throughout in a picture that doesn't have enough foreground, in terms of an engaging story or characters, to distract them from counting cars. Richly photographed and most decorously detailed but overall, one long bore. Even the potentially strong social question of whether a devoted mother can be deprived of the custody of her children because of lesbian tendencies sort of floats by without raising much of a rumpus. As a followup to her Oscar awarded outing in Woody Allen's insufferable ""Blue Jasmine"" two years ago, this is another waste of Ms. Blanchett's enormous talent and screen charisma. Can't blame her though for accepting leading roles in films by prestige directors like Woody and Todd -- just too bad -- and not her fault -- that films like this turn out to be the biggest turkeys of the directors in question.",Carol
145,yuenyeeac,Carol,7,1 May 2020,"I watched the movie again and noticed that she had other arrangements every time she met Theresa, and inviting the other party to travel together may just be that no one wants to leave everything and spend so much time with her to relax ...
And for the first time, she invited Theresa to go home, picked up her daughter and went straight to the door of the house, let guests prepare refreshments in the kitchen and play with her daughter in the living room ...
Perhaps it was such a lack of care that she always had the ability to master the initiative, and Theresa who loved too much could only moth the fire without turning back.

Going from the strong lead to this desperate downtrotten woman. I wanted to like this interesting story so much more than I did, but really Carol is just too slow with not enough rising action. The villains are truly terrible and that pushes the story along, but besides that, I felt that a good story missed its opportunity to be great by missing more excitement.",Carol
148,briefexistance,disappointing,5,3 January 2019,"2 hours. miracles have been made with two hours of time in matter of filmmaking. this, did not. Those 120 minutes we as an audience gifted towards the people involved in this movie, were just wasted. Reminded me of waiting in the line of the bank, or waiting for my food to be served in my table, or waiting in my car trapped in traffic, after a long and tiring day of college. This analogy popped in my mind because, I waited patiently for something to happen, and it never did. We see Rooney Mara and Cate Blanchett in a soul-less romance in the 50s.This movie, has so many flaws, firstly: the movie lacks character development. This results in the audience never caring about anyone in the film. We don't know their motives or know their lives or their inner world in a intimate way. This made me almost instantly compare with ""Blue is the warmest color"", a waaaaaay more intense, intimate and raw film about lesbian love. Secondly, poor acting. Cate disappointed me greatly, I used to think about her as a more profound actress, and in here, her performance was so plain, so boring, so superficial. I never knew she was in love with Rooney's character, then boom they had sex and I was like ok, then maybe I guess they're in love? Later we get to see one of the most boring, insincere, poorly acted ""i love you"" in film history. And I'm Mexican, I've seen soap operas with more heart and soul, than this scene. Thirdly, poor script: nothing happens. Never. Their romance pops outta of nowhere, they go into a trip, then they come back and split, and after some time (I never understood how much supposedly the story advanced in this part), they reencounter and start over their romance. Well... it was really badly done.I understand its timed in the 50s, that's why the romance is kinda of ""hidden"" to the plain sight. But this mysteriousness of their love is so great and deep, that maybe it was hidden in the acting! If this was the idea, then the producer, actresses and the director were geniuses. Otherwise, it's a really bad attempt of portraying lesbian love.The only character I believed was Sarah Paulson, she rocks it. Another thing I liked was the cinematography, i think it was beautiful. Almost like a memory, that scene, where we see them driving and watching the landscape. it was really awesome, transported me to ""that"" feeling. Also, those scenes where Rooney's character feels trapped, was flawlessly done. Frames in a frames are always powerful in a scene, and this is not the exception. The music, on the other hand, was touching, but sadly the actresses didn't portrayed the beautiful romance the music wants you to feel and empathize with.So, I give it a 5. Amazing music and camerawork, but boring script, plain acting and poor use of scenes and time to develop a story properly, in a engaging way. But hey! maybe this will help film academy students to learn what they shouldn't do while making a film so, there's always a positive side.",Carol
149,TigerHeron,One of Most Boring Films I Have Ever Seen,5,22 May 2016,"I have seen a lot of movies. I mean a lot. And this is among the top five most boring movies I have ever seen.Most of the film consists of Rooney Mara and Cate Blanchett staring at each other. They fall in love, although it's not clear why, since Mara's character barely speaks and Blanchett's is about 20 years older than Mara's. They have nothing in common except that they're both lesbians. After many drawn out scenes of long looks, they finally begin touching each other, and this is one of the few scenes with any activity at all.There's a drama about the Blanchett character's divorce, but it is predictable.It's incredible to me that the story was written by the same woman who wrote ""Strangers on a Train,"" one of my favorite films. Then again, that film was directed by Alfred Hitchcock.This is a snoozefest and after it had been playing for 40 minutes I thought that two hours was almost up. I don't even know why I watched it until the end. I guess I kept hoping something interesting would happen.",Carol
150,Teyss,"Delicate, charming melodrama supported by perfect actresses",8,28 January 2016,"""Carol"" is a beautiful love story, shot in old-fashioned melodramatic style, notably thanks to the 16mm film texture. True, as some critics have highlighted, it partly relies on ""lesbian aesthetics"", which is an easy solution especially with two handsome actresses (each in their own, different way). Yet even in ""heterosexual films"" actors frequently look attractive, so we cannot specifically blame this movie.SUBTLE INNUENDOSIt is difficult to demonstrate the qualities of the movie because everything is so nuanced. Indescribable ways to look at each other, certain tones, simple replicas, even silences: emotion subtly arises as sometimes in real life. Non-verbal elements are more important than plot and dialogues. One striking example is the start of the love scene, where Carol intensely looks at Therese in the mirror, chastely unties her bathrobe belt without a word and then stands still: minimal action, stunning effect.Todd Haynes was apparently inspired by the work of Ruth Orkin and Morris Engel in the 1950s, however the movie also reminded me of Douglas Sirk, the master of melodrama. And precisely it is difficult to defend Sirk: plots are generally plain, dialogues apparently naive, characters mostly caricatures... yet his movies are masterpieces because of his unique, grandiose style. Granted, ""Carol"" does not fully reach Sirk's level, although it comes close.CONFUSIONThe two main characters are struggling with life: Carol is in the middle of an ugly divorce, Therese is searching for her identity, notably sexually. Interestingly, she regrets agreeing to everything but actually turns down all of her boyfriend's proposals and rejects the boy kissing her. She only says ""yes"" to Carol which demonstrates her attraction to her, even if she is not fully aware of it yet.Very efficiently, Haynes illustrates these struggles by confusing the image.
The two women are frequently seen behind windows with reflections or rain drops.They are lost in the crowd and noise, notably in the department store. In the street, passers-by hide the main scene (for instance Carol in Abby's car).The long shot on the gorgeous photo of Carol sleeping is seen through moving liquid.Significantly, the start of the important love scene is seen in a mirror.Sometimes, a sound occurs before the related shot: for instance we hear a phone ringing at the end of shot 1, then we move to shot 2 in a completely different place where someone picks up the phone.As spectators, we are confused, like the characters, by these mixes of images and sounds. However, as soon as the two women start to live their love, scenes are more relaxed, simply shot full frame without all this agitation... before the movie moves into the abject plot of the divorce. (To those who think that the taped hotel scene is incredible: this happened to Patricia Highsmith's female lover, whose story partly inspired the book the movie is based on.) Only at the end will we find quietness again.TOUCHING CHARACTERSCarol's character is complex: fragile and strong, mother and lover, classy and sensuous, delicate and harsh, frank and secretive, intelligent and clumsy. She faces a tough dilemma between family and love. It is a perfect role for Cate Blanchett. We easily understand why Therese is attracted to her from the beginning.Therese's character is also interesting: while Carol is at crossroads, her path is more linear. We see her progress from curiosity to friendship, then to intimacy, then to love. Her personality also evolves, from an almost teenage girl without friends and desires, stuck with a simple boyfriend, to eventually a resolute lady (when she looks like Audrey Hepburn, which adds to the old-fashioned style). Rooney Mara is a revelation. However regarding this metamorphosis, I think the movie has one flaw: it starts at the end, so we see Therese already transformed by her experience; then there is a long flashback, before we come back to the ending. Probably the transformation would have been more compelling with a straightforward chronology.Another small downside is the lack of social context: apart from the husband and the divorce procedure, we do not witness despise towards homosexuality, which was omnipresent at the time, even in New York. At no point do we see people looking angry or insulting the two women. Also, some themes might have been explored more thoroughly, for instance the age and/or social difference between the lovers.-----These minor drawbacks excepted, ""Carol"" stands out as a reference in what we could name ""historical homosexual genre"", to simplify. It is clever, intriguing, charming, sensual. It also is pleasing that the movie ends well, unlike many homosexual movies unfortunately (they frequently end up in separation, exile, depression, injury and/or death). Still, just like Therese says love is unexplainable like chemistry, many qualities of the movie (as Therese's photos) remain somewhat of a mystery, and maybe all the better so.",Carol

The family dysfunction beautifully displayed at Christmas time (symbolic of family and stress) is not balanced. What should have been a torrid love affair implied between Therese and Carol falls flat. The chemistry between the two actresses was glaringly missing. Tightly controlled and magnetic performances by Cate Blanchett and Rooney Mara (as well as Kyle Chandler as the offended husband of Carol) are slowed down by director Todd Haynes (of ""Far From Heaven"") who seems to focus on visual scenes at the expense of the storytelling. ""Carol"" expresses not only a story about two generous souls falling in love but also the mindset of a society entrenched in hard-hearted ""values"".

152,DavidLindahl,A story about homosexual love that never really takes off,6,9 April 2016,"Carol is the story of forbidden love in the 50's between Carol, played by Cate Blanchett and Therese, played by Rooney Mara. The film is made from the book The Price of Salt, written by the renowned author Patricia Hightower famous for other works such as Strangers on a Train or The Talented Mr Ripley. The Director Todd Haynes has previous experiences with the genre especially in the great film Far From Heaven, so I had some expectations. Roney Mara and Cate Blanchett both play their characters superbly well and Haynes has really succeeded in creating a good personal chemistry between them.Carol is a well made film combined with great cinematography and beautiful music by Carter Burwell. We are quickly introduced to Therese and realizes that she isn't comfortable with her relationship with Richard. When she meets Carol, sparks fly and we can tell they have got an attraction. However, Carol has a heavy history and Therese gets drawn into a divorce, a custody battle and a jealous ex-lover. I think this is where it gets problematic because we know so much about Carol and her background, but we are left to draw our own conclusions and make guesses about Therese's past life. Perhaps we would have better understood and known Therese, had we got to know more about her life. I also don't feel like we really understand why Carol is drawn specifically to Therese. Is it love or just mere passion? She has a past of female lovers and doesn't appear to have felt the same thing for them.As Carol reaches the end I still don't feel like the main characters faces any real trouble. Carol's husband appears to be relatively understanding and we don't know anything about Therese's life and her social circle, and can therefore only speculate on how they would react. It is really not that much standing in their way and yet they mess it up. I think if their love would have been made an even greater struggle and faced with larger obstacles it would have felt more stronger and important. Plain and simple, the film would have needed to be a bit more dramatic. But, still it is a good film and I do get drawn into their story.David Lindahl - www.filmografen.se",Carol

154,chemingineer,Exploitative Love,8,22 August 2017,"Carol is an extraordinary Lesbian love story between Carol and Therese set in America of 1950s. The film is titled ""Carol"" and not ""Carol and Therese"" because Carol dominates. She schemes to hook the wide-eyed Therese, manipulates her and always manages to get her way. Their first encounter in the toy section of a department store sizzles with subtexts. Carol is shopping for a Christmas present for her 4-year old daughter and asks Therese, the store girl, to recommend a suitable doll. Therese prefers a train-set and the die is cast! She conveniently leaves behind her gloves on the counter so that Therese can reach out to her. Carol's marriage is unhappy, primarily because of her sexual orientation. She has another closet lover, an intriguing woman named Abby (played by a pokerfaced Sarah Paulson) who narrates one of their physical encounters to Therese and unhelpfully concludes - ""nobody knows why these things happen"". Therese, played with great panache by Rooney Mara, is a foreigner, naïve, vulnerable, who can't ever say ""No"". Initially confused by Carol's advances, she decides to play along, unsure and confused about her own sexuality. As the film progresses, we see her personality evolving along with her photography skills. Another metaphor worth savouring, if you please. Are we watching the film from Therese's POV?The film is lavishly shot and panders to our senses. The two women enjoy the fabric and furniture in opulent hotel rooms, dab each other with perfumes and clink martini glasses. Soft focus, muted colours, soothing voices, all in sync with the subject matter of the film, lend it a gorgeous look. The film is set in cold Christmas week and the riot of warm colours is an interesting counterpoint. Director Todd Haynes, uses a circular narration and establishes the period of the film through TV images of Dwight Eisenhower, lovingly shot Buicks and Teddy Wilson's vinyls. The film is punctuated with ring tones – train whistles, phone rings, bells, elevator alarms – jarring realities in a lyrical ballad. The toast to President McKinley is a wicked reference that will take some working out. In a film bristling with Lesbian love, all such references are coded, in keeping with the times. Deciphering these codes may require a second viewing and is an obvious delight. But ultimately Carol belongs to Cate Blanchett, who literally lives the part. Most times, she lets her eyes speak. Eyes that brilliantly convey the physical yearning. Eyes that manage to seduce not only Therese, but us viewers. She manages to make us love her despite her blatant exploitation of Therese. My final thought as I left the film: Carol exploits an ambivalent woman much like a man would do to a woman. She has her reasons, but is it justified? Is exploitation a learned behaviour?",Carol

157,Hassan_Scarborough,Gorgeous enough to keep you awake,5,1 December 2016,"This film dragged from start to finish. It's beautifully shot and should have been awarded for production design. The performances were only okay to me. Cate Blanchett seems to be playing a similar character in her recent films. I know some actors after a while incorporate some of their own traits into their characters, and then it becomes hard for the audience to discern between each role. That or Rooney and her were simply miscast in this. I liked Cate's look in this but for some reason it was like she was channeling Katherine Hepburn too much. Good actors sometimes carry a film too much and sometimes they are simply not right for the part. The chemistry seemed strained in this. I've always been highly critical of adaptations. It's simply not possible to incorporate it all into a single film. This film seemed like it was too long. Another issue is Rooney, director and screen writer didn't do a great job really conveying that Therese was attracted to Carol from the very beginning. The author Patricia Highsmith(whom Therese is based off of) described seeing this beautiful blonde in a mink coat as almost feeling faint,"" yet at the same time uplifted, as if I had seen a vision."" I did not see this until later and even then it was diminished under this layer of tragedy of Carol going through this unseemly custody battle. And I don't see how a mother can be broken up by a custody battle for her only child and run around with a young women, only to leave the affair and asking her friend and former lover to watch over her new lover. Even in an adaptation there needs to be a balance between the source and compiling elements that work throughout the story. The ego bruised men were too much of a negative distraction that never helped tell the story. Not to mention the story is predicated on women who lied to these men in their lives and they seemingly tell these men to kiss their collectives butts because now neither woman needs them anymore. These two women, with little, in the way of, redeeming qualities to begin with. Carol is a spoiled brat that didn't have a care in the world and seemed more like a hurt child, than an experienced lesbian showing a young lover the way to ecstasy, and embracing her sexual appetites.

The film is edited and directed very well, despite having just a few issues with it. There were a bunch of shots included of moments that needed explanation, but they never were. Towards the end of the film something happens that endangers the two main characters, and it's never explained how it happened. It's hard to talk about without spoiling the film, but this element is crucial to the story and the occurrence doesn't make sense in context with the story. The writing was mostly pretty good, but I feel like they could've bettered the romance aspect, I feel like they never fell in love at times, you barely see them laugh or just talk about their life and their story, and I think we should've gotten more of that. Just maybe one or two scenes more with stuff, it's not too a big of a deal, but I think it would better the film. There were also a few minor issues that aren't worth mentioning.

162,ReelBrew,The story of love between two woman in 1950's New York,9,16 January 2016,"A delicate touch from an adorned hand, its nail's awakened with red. The longing gaze across a tonally somber department store, the whirl of shoppers momentarily silenced. The aromatic embrace of a perfume that lingers on a woman's top. A heavy silence that permeates the air between phone lines, an ""I miss you"" lost between thoughts. These are mere moments that make up Todd Haynes' (Far From Heaven) rapturously gorgeous film, speaking softly to the love between two people without actually uttering a single word. Early in our film, watching a movie from the projection room, one of the character's friends states that he is ""plotting the correlation between what the characters say and what they feel."" In doing so, Carol intermittently begins separating the actions and the voice, unfolding an exquisitely layered story right in front of us. Evoking the times of the 50's with the contemporary struggles of today, Carol is a meticulously crafted piece that demonstrates the tight- rope balance between exhibition and expressive, offering up a plethora of the intimate through visual storytelling.Set between the month before, and the months after 1952, Carol tells the story of the love between two women from flutteringly different places in life; one longing with ambition, the other discovering with inhibition. Therese Belivet (Rooney Mara) is a shop girl and aspiring photographer stuck behind the counter of a toy store, the dolls behind her looking outwardly with an empty gaze. Her desperate need to break free is symbolized in a train set, its red caboose trailing behind with an urgency to keep up. Carol Aird(Cate Blanchett) is an upper-class mother on the tail end of a frayed marriage, less searching for love than acceptingly absorbing it. Her leather gloves conceal her bedecked hands, their diaphanous touch evoking an assured grace and desire throughout the film. What begins quietly over martinis, soon blossoms into a love that precariously balances on the edge. Amidst this newfound desire, Carol finds herself caught up in a legal battle for her daughter, while Therese fights to discover who she is.Director Todd Haynes, adapting Patricia Highsmith's 1952 novel, The Price of Salt, suffuses Carol with poignancy; deftly displaying what love looks like rather than what it says. These are moments that are accentuated by looks, of long gazes and understood emotion. What is stated may become the obvious, as these powerfully hushed scenes exude a sense of direction and containment that words can only add to. However, Phyllis Nagy brings an eloquent and insightful approach to Carol and Therese, carving two women with a honed manner that creates a commandment when their voices crack the silence. There's a separation to how Haynes' characters feel to what they say, giving a voice to their demeanor, to their bodies that Highsmith was unable to fully achieve in her novel. When Carol stares into a mirror at her reflection, it's a quiet scene that is undercut with searching eyes and sorrowful words. As Therese listens to the silence on the other end of a telephone, cutting to Carol and back, we understand explicitly what these two are saying. It's these images of two women, of love and acceptance that form the words that are expressed, giving a depth to these characters that embody so much of what pulsates within our own selves. Carol's husband Harge (Kyle Chandler) expresses a pained love with bursts of rage fueled by alcohol, while Therese's boyfriend Richard (Jake Lacy) expresses it with paper thin sincerity. The men in their lives contradict their feelings with what they say, confusing anger with passion, and necessity for desire. Both struggle to put one foot in front of the other, aligning them with the societal structure for marriage. It's a concept that drives both women away from them, ultimately bringing the two together.Imbuing Carol with uncompromising beauty is costume designer Sandy Powell, who earlier this year brought Cinderella from fantasy to fantastic; working with Judy Becker and makeup artist Jodi Byrne to bring the 1950's roaring back to life. From gold inlaid bangles to extravagant fur coats and lush red lipstick, Powell, Byrne and Becker help define the distinct separation between our character's lives. As our story develops and our characters evolve, each begins exhibiting tonal shifts that define the other; Therese's shade of lipstick becomes brighter, while Carol's dulls to almost nothing. Powell and Byrne utilize red in the same manner, subtly placing it at first to the side, in a coat on a crowded street corner, working it through till it rests on the lips of our characters. It's a symbolic gesture that is reminiscent of the train-set Carol buys for her daughter, the red caboose trailing behind. When Carol walks to her lawyer's office in order to fight for custody of her daughter Rindy (sisters Sadie and Kk Heim), it's her red coat that stands out amidst the grays and browns of the street. During a road trip, Carol applies shades of opulent red to Therese's lips, preening her with perfume and nail polish. It's this idea of following, of chasing after something that resounds in all of us, and of feeling lost in our own tiny world that comes out extravagantly through the films impeccable art direction....Read more at www.reelbrew.tumblr.com",Carol
163,christian-larson,Not worthy of a best picture nominee,6,12 February 2016,"Carol is tells the plot of how a older lesbian woman and an younger woman get in love, but it sets up difficulties as the younger woman is finding herself, and the older woman is having troubles with marriage. Cate Blanchett is great as always, Oscar worthy. But in my opinion, Rooney Mara gives a good performance but her character is really bland. Not really that interesting, but changes over time. Her character (Therese) is really silent, not a lot to say and basically says yes to anything. Its interesting how a character can change over time, but she really only changes at the end, not exactly her personality. Carol's character is even more interesting as she was married, but now she is divorcing, now that she knows inside of her that she is a lesbian. The cinematography is good, but sometimes can be crowded and sometimes the long and wide shots were necessary for certain shots, but since the cinematography is not really wide, its hard to see sometimes. The story, as interesting as it could have been, has no real substance as its just a love story and it can get repetitive and overusing at times. The subplot of the divorce of Carol is not handled well as sometimes you understand the husband, and you are willing to see him succeed instead of the lead character. It lasted for way too long, and it does not have enough emotional punch for the audience to care for Therese as she is disoriented and does not understand how to feel human emotions; she is way too distracted and her personal life its not interesting. The photographs she takes even that are good, she admits that they are not good, but it just gets so repetitive when she complains about everything and makes stupid excuses. The direction and cinematography its good, Carols performance is great but the substance of the story does not really impact the audience as well as it could have been. 6.5/10",Carol

Beautiful.Possibly the best film that I've seen with hardly any real action. It felt like a dream.A very vanilla review, I know. I've just watched this film and I'm feeling very tranquil. The final end scene honestly took my breath away- and with no dialogue! Absolutely sublime filmmaking.Just lovely.

166,charlesem,Reprinted from my blog (charlesmatthews.blogspot.com),8,10 March 2017,"With her Mamie Eisenhower bangs and heart-shaped face, Rooney Mara in Carol becomes the reincarnation of such '50s icons as Audrey Hepburn, Jean Simmons, and Maggie McNamara -- particularly the McNamara of The Moon Is Blue (Otto Preminger, 1953), that once- scandalous play and movie about a young woman who defies convention by talking openly about sex while retaining her virginity. It's just coincidence that Carol is set at the end of 1952 and into 1953, the year of the release of The Moon Is Blue, but the juxtaposition of McNamara's Patty O'Neill and Mara's Therese Belivet seems to me appropriate because the 1950s have become such a touchstone for examining our attitudes toward sex. Director Todd Haynes and screenwriter Phyllis Nagy, adapting a novel by Patricia Highsmith, have done an exemplary job in Carol of not tilting the emphasis toward Grease-style caricature or Mad Men-style satire of the era, or exploiting the same-sex relationship in the film for sensationalism or statement-making. Carol is a story about people in relationships, clear-sightedly viewed in a way that Therese herself would endorse. After asking her boyfriend Richard (Jake Lacy) if he's ever been in love with a boy and receiving a shocked reply that he's only ""heard of people like that,"" Therese replies, ""I don't mean people like that. I just mean two people who fall in love with each other."" It's this matter-of-factness that the film tries to maintain throughout its story of Therese and Carol (Cate Blanchett), the well-to-do wife in a failing marriage. That the film is set in the 1950s, when cracks were showing in the conventional attitudes toward both marriage and homosexuality, gives piquancy to their relationship, but it doesn't limit it. The story could be (and probably is) playing itself out today in various combinations of sexual identity. The film works in large part because of the steadiness of Haynes at the helm, with two extraordinary actresses at the center and beautiful support from Sarah Paulson as Abby, Carol's ex-lover, and Kyle Chandler (one of those largely unsung actors like the late Bill Paxton who make almost everything they appear in better) as Carol's husband, the hard-edged Harge Aird. The sonic texture of the 1950s is splendidly provided by Carter Burwell's score and a selection of classic popular music by artists like Woody Herman, Georgia Gibbs, Les Paul and Mary Ford, Perry Como, Eddie Fisher, Patti Page, Jo Stafford, and Billie Holiday.",Carol
167,thatpunkadam,Waking up from the American Dream,9,7 January 2016,"The age difference isn't the relationship's sole hook—rather it's where the women are in their respective stages of life. Carol, having been pulled through the American Dream, is torn between her loyalty to her family and her own happiness, while Therese has only started considering long- term love, realizing Richard could eventually become Harge. Mara's wide eyes invokes a childish excitement and fear, but which finds empathy in Blanchett's aura of experience. Deeper, inspired perhaps by the fearful prospect of losing her daughters in the divorce, there's a particular scene where Therese is sitting at a piano (if I recall correctly) and Carol stands behind her elegantly coursing her hands through the young woman's hair. It's quiet and quaint, though it's our first tactile piece of evidence that Carol's interest in Therese extends beyond customer satisfaction. And, more beautifully, upon analysis, it's perhaps the moment where Carol's motherly duties are liberated by her motherly love for a woman she can finally love without being a mother.FULL REVIEW HERE: indieadam.com/2016/01/07/carol-2015-review-indie-adam/",Carol
168,kurt-2000,Outstanding,10,9 March 2017,"What a wonderful film. I thought about it days later. All of the unfairness against women that you've read about is highlighted in this film. The legal system stacked in favor of men. The bigots that condemn same gender relationships. The control freaks that get into women's faces. It's all here. And a touching love story. And even the ending made me wonder what the characters decided to do next. If you're a bigot, you'll hate this film. If you understand the human race, you'll enjoy it. And talk about stepping back into the 1950's. The background and cars were wonderful. I felt like a time traveler. No wonder this film was nominated for so many awards, and won a few awards as well. Kate...the world is paying attention to you now.",Carol
169,JaysonT,One of the Most Overrated Films of the Year,5,20 December 2015,"I had been looking forward to this film for months, and upon finally viewing it- it's a huge disappointment. Todd Haynes, who's finest achievement is still Far From Heaven (2002), has a knack for creating intimate atmospheres with radiant colors and backdrops. Like Far from Heaven, he succeeds with the aesthetic values of the 1950s by giving us refined art direction and beautiful costumes. Unlike Far from Heaven, we are given wooden characters and a predictable script, with a score by Carter Burwell that sounds exactly like Philip Glass's creation for The Hours (2002).Rooney Mara works in a department store, and finds herself attracted to Cate Blanchett, a well to do married woman who flirts with her while shopping for Christmas presents. Later they have lunch, and in the only truly well acted scene in the film, seem to connect almost instantaneously. The dialogue here is cleverly limited- so we can instead watch the suggestive gestures of both characters that indicate sexual attraction- and tension. It's too bad this is the only scene I felt was able to capture this. The rest of the movie unfolds like a poorly written episode of the series Mad Men, as the women keep meeting up secretly whilst the husband gets suspicious and even hires a detective to follow them to a hotel so he can later gain custody of Blanchett's child. This is because homosexuality is ""naughty"".Perhaps the reason I felt bored watching Carol was that the material is old and tired. Sexual repression in the 50s? We've seen this so many times. Brokeback Mountain (2005) also dealt with homosexuality with two men- and with much sharper direction and a more interesting story. The actors there were also more believable. Speaking of the acting, Cate Blanchett is indeed the standout. She's not nearly as strong as I had heard or hoped for, but she's none the less ravishing and breathtaking to gaze upon. She's at the peek of her career now, with 2 Oscars under her belt, and indeed Carol should easily earn her a deserved 7th nomination. But besides a juicy scene towards the end, the character isn't that intriguing. There's a lot to be desired, and that easily could be the fault of the screenwriter (Phyllis Nagy), who adapted the script. Yes I get it- it's supposed to be subtle, but this character felt empty. Blanchett is a fine actress- we could have gotten some more fire from her character.Rooney Mara is even more flat. She relies simply on her pretty face. I kept thinking Natalie Portman would have exuded so much more energy with the role, since both women have similar physical dynamics to their facial structures. Mara just comes off weak. There's not an ounce of integrity or feeling coming through with this performance. If that's how she was supposed to play it, then the fault lies in the director. How she won at Cannes is beyond me. She's not impressive at all. She's pretty, but that doesn't constitute good acting.The rest of the cast is easily forgettable. Sarah Paulson has a thankless role, and she's usually very good (watch her in 12 Years a Slave). Mara's boyfriend is the worst acting I've seen all year; very high school drama club. Everyone else is going through their lines in a robotic tone.This could have been an exceptional film. And I'm in the minority who didn't like it (it's currently one of the top reviewed films of 2015, and destined to be crowned with nominations on Oscar morning). But it left me feeling cold, and bored. I might just be sick of seeing movies about the 1950s and how everyone couldn't ""talk about things like being gay, and sex, and racial relations"" back then. The subject has been hammered over my head too many times. But the trailer for this movie was a love letter. Why couldn't the movie be the same? Mara and Blanchett are supposed to be in love, and yet their first meeting aside- I never really felt a true connection between them. There was never enough juice in their chemistry for me to believe it.",Carol
170,manisimmati,A Masterpiece of Eroticism,10,4 July 2017,"America in the fifties. Two women accidentally meet. Therese Belivet is a shy shop assistant dreaming of becoming a photographer. Carol Aird, the mother of a girl named Rindy, is about to get divorced. The two dissimilar women fall in love with each other. Slowly they're drawing closer and closer together, which might be damaging to Carol's child custody. But is Carol to give up her true love just because the people around her think she's crazy or even sick?The movie ""Carol"" is based on the novel ""The Price of Salt"", published by Patricia Highsmith in 1952. It was the first serious book depicting a lesbian couple without being sleazy or scandalizing – an arresting read full of suspense and deep emotion. Amazingly, Todd Haynes' adaption from 2015 does it justice in every single way. ""Carol"" is a masterpiece of eroticism: subtle, wistful and restless. To some people, this movie might look painfully slow and cheesy. But let me tell you: It isn't. The eagerness of ""Carol"" is tender, vulnerable even. You have to get into that. But if you do, my God is it great. The two leading actresses are both stunning. Cate Blanchett is perfect as the aloof, yet broken gentlewoman Carol. But the real revelation here is Rooney Mara as Therese. Rarely have I seen such breathtaking performance. Rooney masters every nuance of the femme fragile: she's reticent, sad, unsteady and endlessly yearning. Cate and Rooney have a great chemistry, too. The way they connect with each other through the smallest gestures and glances is exquisite.Haynes' very noirish and noble staging does a great job at expanding all these details. Every word and touch becomes a gentle promise of what's to come. ""Carol"" is a very physical, sensual movie. It's not just about love. It's about sex as well. The script delays the convergence of the two protagonists as long as possible, until the tension is almost unbearable. That is what eroticism is all about: hesitation and frustration. The script also resists the temptation to make the love story preachy. Carol and Therese are treated as humans, not as women. Their dilemma is mostly personal, not political.""Carol"" is a great flick: It's filled with delicate hints, honest tragedy and suspenseful eroticism. One of the best romantic movies I've ever seen.",Carol
171,emilywes56,Beautiful,7,6 December 2017,"What I loved most about this film, except its unique protagonists, Cate Blanchett, who plays a powerful woman living the ""perfect life"" in New York having a child and a successful husband and Rooney Mara, an Audrey Hepburn figure, elegant, innocent and brave, ready to fall in love even if it 'll cost her a lot, is the unique, magnificent photography. The colors, the textures, clothing, everything is excellent, depicting this golden era of New York Times and urban life in New York. I also liked the ending. Director gives us these intense gazes from both sides of the two women and finally, in a Hollywood production, we are not sure of the exact ending of their last meeting together.",Carol
172,bobandlulureview,Brilliant performance by Cate and Rooney,5,27 April 2018,"It is easy to understand why Cate and Rooney were nominated for the Oscars while the movie wasn't for Best Picture. The actors have done a wonderful job of portraying their respective characters. Cate as the older, unhappy woman who is always impeccably dressed and appears nonchalant but on a closer look reveals a frightened, confused woman with low self esteem. Carol constantly sets her hair and face, worried she's not looking good enough. Rooney is the wistful, innocent little shop assistant who is clearly infatuated with Carol and her rich lifestyle but at the same time is not needy or parasitic. Carol describes Therese as a strange girl, flung out of space. The movie was also nominated for cinematography and deservedly so. The story is set in the 50s when homosexuality was still a taboo and looked down upon. The film is very subtle in its references and there is no garish display of feelings between the characters. The film has also captured the emotions and the feeling of resignation/helplessness that a woman in Carol's shoes would have felt during that period. When Carol is not allowed to meet her daughter, she decides to go on a road trip by simply stating ""what else am I going to do?"" Carol needs the certificate of a psychotherapist to be deemed a mother capable of bringing up her daughter. (We can let out a sigh of relief that that this was in the 50s, we have made much progress since then OR have we?)I love observing the background and the objects in films that are set in different eras. I particularly remember the ancient looking door handle of the fridge. The filmmakers have paid great attention to detail.The film focuses on the most conflicted question we face in our lives - to follow ones heart or mind? I got a bit bored halfway through because I do not like films that have melancholia lurking in the background. The movie is a bit slow to my liking and this is not my favourite movie of Cate Blanchett.",Carol
173,elect_michael,"Masterful Performances, Envisioned Directing",8,2 April 2021,"8 stars of 10. Cate Blanchett & Rooney Mara star alongside each other and they both deliver masterpiece performances. The subtleties that Blanchett is able to deliver in this film are magical, and as in so many of her films, she simply leaves a person asking if there is anyone that can deliver the craft of acting better? Blanchett almost always brings to the forefront of my mind the thought that she either is or among the best Actors on the planet.And Rooney Mara keeps up with Blanchett and is just as good, delivering a performance that peels back layers that few could do without overreaching.Sarah Paulson stars alongside Blanchett and Mara and puts on a superb performance with intricacies that simply work brilliantly, like the twiddling of her lit cigarette in the diner scene with Mara, simple but intricate, little but big, controlled but chaotic.This is all tied together by Todd Haynes.

Blanchett and Mara both gave amazing performances in this film. Such an important subject and story to tell, they did it with grace and compassion. Todd Haynes did a wonderful capturing the varying emotions throughout this film as well. Nominated for multiple Oscars, I can understand the Academy's approval of this film.

With the high rating and glowing reviews, and some people dubbing it as ""the greatest lesbian romantic movie"", I was expecting to see something really good. Man, was I let down. Rooney Mara can't act to save her life. I've seen her in other movies before and she was always this stiff. Not sure how she can even have a career in acting. She always had the same facial expression, the same delivery for every line, she reminds me of Zooey Deschanel who also always had the same facial expression and the same line delivery in all her movies. Cate Blanchett was okay but she seemed to be too absorbed in making her character look and sound ""50s classy"". I don't know what the director was aiming for here but it's clear that character development and story were the least of his concern. The director was probably too focused on making a ""pretty"" film or a film that wins awards rather than a film that the viewers can relate to on a personal level. No character development, no buildup, no soul, dull, very unconvincing romance.",Carol

Cate Blanchet of course is without comparison but there were times when she gave off a Gena Rowlands vibe. Other than looking good in clothes and looking longingly at each other they really don't have much to do. The custody battle isn't enough to hold an audience's interest. The one & only sex scene is OK - the movie could have benefited from a few more nude scenes. The cinematography is amazing & the true star of this movie is Cincinnati Ohio.

If Carol was suppose to be a manipulative wealthy woman who has had several affairs and gets what she wants then Cate Blanchett was perfect for the role. However, is she was to be seen as truly in love with the younger shop assistant and we are to have sympathy for her during that time period and that she would have to give a lot away to be with her then Cate Blanchett did not convince.

It was also 1 of the most inspiring movies i have ever seen. Let me start by saying i am a 44 year old man...who went into the movie theater with little expectation..i just wanted to kill some time, but carol was more than i could have ever imagined. The music the cinematography, the writing was all stunning. Cate Blanchett has always been an actress that i liked but now she is one of favorites. She was both nurturing and fierce all at once..she was emotionally vulnerable and strong at the same time.This was some of the best acting i have ever seen,and Cate was gorgeous. Rooney Mara is a truly talented young woman, unlike many actors of her generation, she is a true artist.Fearless and willing to give all to her role. The sense of need and longing between the two women was overwhelming.I love stories about brave individuals who live for freedom..and live for happiness despite society's disapproval and judgement.This story of these two woman and there deep all consuming love..was just such a story.The best of it's kind i have ever seen! Carol and every relationship in her world, whether it was her relationship with her young lover..or her relationship with her best friend was based on deep love and affection, and society's disapproval or their ""lifestyle"" made those bonds all the more powerful.This movie was also the most inspiring movie i have ever seen, it was particularly powerful for me as I was once a young man with an interest in photography and it wasn't until someone else noticed the potential in me that i didn't see, that i was encouraged to pursue my true vocation. In this carol was also unparalleled, carol as a character, she recognized potential in Therese that even she did not realize was there, Carol helped her see it and a young male photo editor encouraged her as well.This was the ultimate movie about love,connection,freedom and pursuing your happiness and potential even when the world tells you shouldn't or can't.Many American movie viewers may not get it, they're simply not used to seeing this kind of subtle and heartfelt material that communicates with subtle touch and looks instead of having the characters emotions explained with words..very intelligent movie for thinking people. Lovely,positive, sensual, romantic ,inspiring, visually stunning, perfect.See this movie!",Carol

183,timmyminh,A film of class & elegance,8,6 December 2020,"This picture exudes an old sense of class & elegance. And the way it demonstrates so is through the outstanding and superb use of cinematography. I mean, my goodness me the cinematography is breathtaking and mesmerizing. If I'm not mistaken, the very underrated director Todd Haynes chose his cinematographer Ed Lachman to shoot the film using a 16mm in order to give it an older aesthetic and it was impeccably beautiful. Probably in my top 5 films with inspiring cinematography ever.The way the story ebbs & flows is just so natural, it's different from any other love story, and than other gay love story. The plot is natural, the chemistry between Cate and Rooney is marvelousl well-directed and well-written. And the dramas that the two individually experiences throw out the film is so aligned with the archetypal struggles that many gay women go through, not just that but the dramas are in harmony with the ages of the two women - Carol is stuck in her generation's struggle which is marriage and custody and an envious husband; Therese is stuck in her generation's struggle of a young woman's life infused by the idea and pressures of marriage and men's pursuit for her.Last but not least, that performance by Cate Blanchett is one of the very few acting performances I can proudly describe as ""mindblowing"" and it blew my mind.

184,BrendanMichaels,The Greatest Romance FIlm Of The Decade,10,14 March 2016,"What makes a film a masterpiece? The direction? The writing? The acting? For me, everything must work perfectly. If you want your film to be remembered and be amazing you better bring everything to it! I can honestly say, without hyperbole, that Carol is one of the greatest films I have ever seen. It is in every way a masterpiece and is one of the best romance stories I have seen unfolded on screen. It brings so much to the table that many films like this try to do and fail. If it reminded me of another film I'd say it's Blue Is The Warmest Color. But I think this is better than Blue Is The Warmest Color in every way.Carol is based off of the Patricia Highsmith novel, The Price of Salt, and stars Rooney Mara and Cate Blanchett as Therese Belivet and Carol Aird. Therese is a department store clerk that one day sees Carol at the store and they both instantly fall in love with each other. The way the story is constructed is beautifully crafted. It's set in the glamorous 1950s in the United States and tells their story of them falling in love. It's honestly one of the best love stories of all time. Their relationship feels so organic and flowing that it makes me so happy to see them on screen together every time. Like how Her has a melancholy tone of the near future Carol has a melancholy tone of the 1950s that is pitch perfect. Their chemistry is so beautiful and flowing that it makes me sob at how perfectly written they are. It easily is the best adapted screenplay of 2015.The direction of the 118 minute picture sets Carol apart from other films with lesbian relationships. The cinematography is breathtaking. I was literally losing breath as I was watching every frame of Carol. It astounds me that cinema can create images such as in Carol. What makes it so perfect to me is that it was shot in film, which all films should be shot in, and gives the film the feel of the 1950s while other films that shoot digitally and are set in another time period look fake because film gives it a crisper, more romantic look.But what makes the film for me is probably the perfect casting of Therese and Carol. Rooney Mara and Cate Blanchett. Now I haven't seen many movies starring Rooney Mara but her performance in this is impeccable. I can't think of another person in the role that could have pulled off her character. Cate Blanchett is, honestly, at her peak in this film. By far my favorite role of hers. They handle the relationship wonderfully and make me believe that these aren't characters, but real people.Carol blends the illustrious feel of the 1950s and the anxiety of the time period as well. It's immaculate score blends with the love of Carol and Therese. Carol is one of the greatest films of the 21st century. If you haven't seen this film that itself is a crime of its own. While it might not be getting the love it deserves from award shows it definitely deserves all your attention.",Carol
185,couching_tiger_eatin_popcorn,Desire/despair,7,20 December 2015,"Carol (2015) is good, but it's frustrating. Everything in it is about distance, and this distance, it's not bright, charged, and incendiary, but rather dull, lifeless and corrosive.The attraction between the two women, Therese and Carol, it's meant to be foreign and impenetrable. As viewers, we are kept at an arm's length at all times. All the shots in this movie are chosen to establish that feeling of distance. Look at how many shots there are of windows in this movie. We're made to be voyeurs, consumers. Both of these women, too, they want, they desire, but are they much more than their desperate instincts? Ham in the glass display case, camera through the shop window, face through the car window, the door window; everywhere, there are windows, and reflections, and images bouncing and fracturing through these see-through prisons.When there are close ups of these characters, they are inaccessible, chopped up, cut off from being whole. Carol's sumptuousness, it's all artifice, and we're not allowed to glimpse who she is at all. She's like a 17th c Dutch still life, the image is there but the subject isn't; you can't touch, feel, smell anything, it's all for show. Then there's Therese's wide-eyed stare, like a machine. A camera herself for most of the movie, she's hungry, invasive yet aloof.The most sincere moment in the movie is in the visual sequence of Therese and Carol driving through a tunnel to New Jersey, the frenetic lights collapsing onto their faces through the car windows. As shots are spliced together disconnectedly, infatuation come alive on screen, and the two women delve deeper into something incomprehensible, something close to love. Once they are through, they'll never be the same again. We are closest to them during that sequence.That was the highlight of the movie for me. During the rest of the movie, these ladies, they're busy filling the deep, black abyss in their lives with desire. The whole movies smells like despair. I suppose it captures the stifling impossibility of sapphic love in the 1950s.Poor babies. Go forth and be happy.",Carol
186,alice-enland,Gray on Brown,3,28 December 2017,"At its root, Carol is just another Hollywood sacrifice laid at the altar of marital infidelity. It's one of the few films other than Notes on a Scandal (another Blanchet project) that dares to show the predatory nature of lesbians. Despite the low review score I accord Carol, I recommend that it be watched on Netflix solely because of the beauty of the art direction and photography. I'm a sucker for movies set in the first half of the 1950s and I loved the time travel feeling I got while watching this. But . . . let's see. Carol targets Therese (pronounced tuh-REZE don't you know) while Christmas shopping in a NYC department store. For her daughter, Carol buys a model train set upon Therese's suggestion. Apparently a pretty young woman suggesting a masculine gift for a little girl was a gender bender signal in NYC in late 1952. Carol intentionally leaves her exquisite leather gloves on the counter when she leaves. Therese mails them back to her then follows up with a phone call. The tone of the call is the same as the tone of their first conversation in the department store and is the same as every other conversation they will have in the movie; dull as gray on brown. Not a hint of excitement or pleasure in either woman's voice. They meet again and Carol invites Therese out for Christmas. Enter Harge, Carol's cuckolder husband who instantly sniffs out the nature of the women's relationship. Harge is drunk and belligerent but he professes love for Carol and a desire to be together. Harge leaves with the daughter for Christmas in Florida. Things plod along. We see Therese taking some pictures, declining an advance by a nice fellow who works for the Times, and acting pretty disinterested in a guy who I think was her pre-Carol romantic interest. Next we have ""Carole and Therese's Boring Road Trip"" where they meet a geeky guy who is a travelling salesman of notions, although he tells them he doesn't know what notions are. That night things get hot and Therese tells Carol in a monotone ""take me to bed."" 
We then have a scene of perfunctory semi nudity (the wannabe star shows more skin than the star has to show). They fall asleep in each other's arms. More gray on brown. The ONLY emotion shown in the flick occurs the next morning when Carole finds out the notions salesman was a private eye who rented the room next to them and tape recorded the gray on brown lovemaking. Carol is distraught and leaves for New York and her friend (and former lover) Abby comes to drive Therese home. Fast forward to the pre-divorce attorney and client conference where Carol is 
pretty quick to give custody to Harge so long as she has visitation rights. Carol and Therese later meet for a drink and Therese declines an invitation to go to a fancy restaurant where Carol is meeting friends. After accepting a friend's invitation to a party, Therese later goes to the crowded restaurant and spots Carol at a table full of people. Therese ... walks ... slowly ... toward ... Carol ... until ... Carol ... sees ... her. Their gazes lock in what appears to be a freeze frame. The end. At last. Now, I've been in love, though never in a same sex relationship. And I've fallen hard, and I've been infatuated. But never have I been as emotionless about it all as these 2 were. I get that this was 1952 and that lesbians had to hide in plain site (like those 2 stereotypes in the record store) and I didn't expect them to be holding hands while walking down 5th Avenue. But . . . when they were alone, still gray on brown? Never a laugh, a smile, a joke, a wink, a giggle ... nothing. Just a lifeless reading of the script. The acting in this was pretty darn lousy if you ask me. Maybe they were just following the book but this doesn't show any character, much less character development. Maybe it was just a book that didn't need to be made into a movie. With the exceptions of the little girl and some of Therese's friends, everyone in this movie is bored to the point of self-destruction. It's Christmas in New York but where is the joy? It's as if a giant Hoover vacuum was used to suck the life out of New York. I'm giving it a 3 because I'm a nice person.",Carol

It can lift you to heights of joy and creativity and give you a sense of purpose and the promise of an exciting future sharing your life with someone. It can also plunge you into the depths of despair and make you perform horrible acts due to jealousy and pain, destroying the object of your affection for selfish gain. If you love truly though, no matter how it manifests, you will discover something new and honest about yourself for better or worse. This is the theme that underscores Carol, the new and engrossing film from director Todd Haynes. Guided by a stellar screenplay by Phyllis Nagy, Haynes has created a nuanced tapestry of love in all its splendor and horror, chronicling its joy and destruction leading to a journey of self-discovery.Carol, based on the novel ""The Price of Salt"" by Patricia Highsmith, opens in New York City in the 1950s. Carol Aird (Cate Blanchett/Truth, Cinderella) is having a quiet, somewhat intense and unheard dinner conversation with Therese Belivet (Rooney Mara/The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, Her).

188,lars_hendrikx,Beautiful in every aspect,10,28 January 2016,"Todd Haynes outdid himself with this splendid movie. Everything in this movie is truly beautiful. What captures the eye at first sight is the spectacular cinematography, the era of the 50's is shown impeccably well in this film. The music draws your attention and keeps you focused and has the perfect amount of emotionality for the scenes it builds a foundation for. The makeup and hair department deserve just as much praise, as they did a magnificent job as well. But the most beautiful aspect of this movie is the acting. I never paid much attention to the acting of Kyle Chandler, but he does an extremely good job in this movie. If the category for best male actor in a supporting role wasn't as swamped as it is, he might have had a chance. He captured me with his emotional expressions. Sarah Paulson and Jake Lacy live up to their parts as well. The best part of the ensemble for this movie are the two lead women. I absolutely loved the chemistry between Cate Blanchett and Rooney Mara, I have seen nothing of the kind between two actresses in any movie. They both deliver incredible, moving and exceptional performances and I am filled with joy that they are both nominated for the Academy Awards for their portrayals of these strong characters, be it controversial categories. This movie is a must see if you want a strong, moving and different love story.",Carol

Instead I had a botoxed Cate Blanchett glaring emptily at something far in distance for most of the movie, and a whimpering and gray little mouse trotting around her feet. I'm not sure what the age gap is meant to be between the two women but Rooney Mara barely feels like more than a child to me, and the older Mrs is just using her for sex and comfort. I saw no love at all in this supposed love story, and no convincing acting what so ever. It is also rather slow paced. I could compliment the photo, the make up, the scenery, the movie is pretty to watch, but there is more to a good movie than just looks.

For any book, or movie to work, We have to ""care"" about the characters.This flick gives us precious little to care about one way or the other.Why does Carol have a loveless marriage? We never find out! Why does does Therese live with some guy? (just some guy, We never find any depth to either of the main characters) The Movie concentrates on how unfair things were for lesbians in the 1950's, and that is tragic, but if We don't care about either character, it's a pointless exercise! A very disappointing film. Hardly worth the time to watch it!Current screenwriters and directors assume if they have an ""issue"" (lesbian treatment in the dark ages of 1950) - then they have a Movie! They don't! Todd Haynes gives us a beautiful failure!",Carol
193,cathey-127,"Overall a very good film, but the development was unconvincing",7,24 December 2015,"I gave some claps after the movie ended, so I did think it was good. The cinematography was beautiful, the music was great, the movie did well in capturing emotions, and the acting definitely deserved the nominations.However, the love story was quite unconvincing. For some reason, Carol just sets eyes on Therese and goes after her. And for some reason Therese just gets obsessed with Carol. All of a sudden Carol's inviting Therese to everything and Therese is getting all awkward around Carol. Don't you know that in a love story you need to at least explain why they got attracted to each other? The sex scene was good, but you can't just throw that out there and claim that that's chemistry. The development was very weak. For the first half of the movie, it was pretty much just Carol seducing Therese and inviting her over. It really just seems like a lesbian hook up, but half way through the movie we're supposed to accept that they're the love of each other's lives? I've seen some complaints about this movie and I do agree on this: The romance seems so forced and rushed, are we just forgiving it because it's a gay relationship? If we take the gay context out, switch the roles of Carol and Harge, make Harge the one ending the marriage and hitting on young girls, would people still be okay with the way the story was developed?And I think the directors really need to understand that being gay doesn't justify everything. It explains why Carol didn't want to be with her husband, but it doesn't justify her abusing him and ignoring him and lying to him. It explains why Therese decided to give up everything with Richard for Carol, but both Richard and Harge were good guys, it's not okay to abuse them like that. It would be one thing if Therese told Richard ""I realized I'm gay and I decided to follow this woman so let's break up"", but it's another that she denied it, lied to him, and still used his feelings for her. OK I realize this is the 50's, but still, by victimizing Harge and Richard, I lost a lot of compassion for Carol and Therese when things didn't work.And Carol's character just wasn't very likable overall. If I had to pick a villain of this film, it would be Carol. Lesbian or not, she was having affairs. Her husband tried to ask her to stay, and she abused his decency. She seduced Therese, and irresponsibly brought Therese with her on her get away trip, then dumped her because she made a mistake and got caught. She seemed to love her daughter, which was probably her one redeeming quality, but then at the beginning of the film she gets her daughter a train set even though her daughter wanted a doll just because she was busy seducing the cute little salesgirl. She claims to love her daughter, but won't compromise anything to Harge even if that was the only way. She dumps Therese and gets her lawyer to make a convincing case for her to gain custody, and she screws his hard work. Yeah I know nobody's a saint, but by making Carol so unlikable, they really make this story a lot harder to sell. I was really surprised that they had a happy ending. In some ways, it didn't seem like Carol deserved it, and Therese deserved more to move on.The story was a good story. The filming was outstanding. But it's not a masterpiece.",Carol

Rooney Mara plays a quiet young woman who still isn't quite sure about the purpose of life, and Cate Blanchett plays a sophisticated woman who's going through a tough divorce. It's based on a 1952 romance novel ""The Price of Salt"" that was pretty popular at the time.Everything about this has drawn me toward it. It's quiet and mesmerizing. The whole look of the film feels authentic, it's grainy and its toned-down color, feel like something that's made in the 70s. It boasts nuanced performances, and cinematography which brings a sense of sincerity to it. I honestly can't find a flaw in it, except the relationship that's formed between the two, felt a bit distant at times, although the more I think about it, it could've been intentional.

But I got so bored I couldn't finish it in one viewing. I have to watch the last thirtysomething minutes the next day. I got bored because I couldn't get emotionally involved. And I couldn't get involved cause the lead actresses weren't able to play the real love between the two women. Well, I guess it's hard to play something you have no idea about but the Oscar nominated performances are beyond belief weak actually. My favourite Cate Blanchett appears to be plain creepy and the talented Rooney Mara pretentious and silly. Only the love scene was surprisingly convinsing and really hot. Kudos to the ladies for that ;) But in the end it seems the whole relationship is based on sexual desire only which is... tasteless. Even the music and the praised cinematography weren't really there to save the day.

Cate Blanchett is simply seductive. Although her character at times is confusing in her hot and cold attitude, using money in her power, we have to keep in mind that she is also a separated mother in the 50's and homosexuality was still very much frowned upon. The cinematography was lovely, wardrobes and everything that just brought the 50's to life in this slow paced, quiet film that speaks volumes through the picture on screen. It's a must see and a must read.",Carol
201,JSmith125,"Too slow, too conventional",4,28 December 2015,"I can see why a story like this might have been edgier and more important when it first appeared in the early 1950s. But things have changed a lot since then. The affair between the two women would not be a big deal today, which means the message that a movie about it carries today is, ""Look how backwards and repressive things were in the 1950s"" (or in some such stories, the early '60s). That's become a hackneyed theme, one that we've seen it in any number of other movies -- ""Dead Poets Society"" and ""Brokeback Mountain,"" to name just two off the top of my head.Still, what we have here would be an interesting period piece -- the look certainly seems convincingly '50s -- except that it's so slow at times that it's like flipping through an album of still pictures. This seems to me a common failing of movies based on celebrated ""literary"" novels: not enough actually happens. The elements that give the novel its reputation are likely its elegant writing, its compelling narrative voice and the interior lives of its characters, and those are precisely the things you can't really put on film. So the filmmakers work around this by substituting long pauses, ""meaningful"" gazes, lingering shots, and painterly compositions (this film's have been compared to Edward Hopper's). I sometimes felt as if the many silent beats between lines of dialogue in this movie were filled up in the filmmakers' heads with the book's prose, which maybe they should have scrolled across the screen or something so the rest of us could experience it too.Then there's the Lifetime-movie-esque plot about the main character Carol's custody dispute. Those events point up how unfair it was when gay relationships were closeted, but again, that's not a groundbreaking insight anymore. Nothing else is interesting about them, and the filmmakers themselves seem so little invested in that part of the story that when she's asked toward the end whether she's been allowed to visit her daughter, Carol gives this unbelievable answer: ""Once or twice."" Once or twice? This was so important to you, this was the thing you were fighting for, and yet you shrug it off now with ""once or twice,"" like you can't even be bothered to remember? In Patricia Highsmith's novel, her answer is: ""Yes, last Sunday for an hour or so."" That's what a mother who actually cared about the kid would remember: exactly when she saw her and for how long. But the writer and director here would rather make nonsense of all her earlier protestations. For them, the husband was just the ""heavy,"" a typical domineering control freak like those in any number of TV movies, and the daughter -- as a friend I saw the film with put it -- was basically just a prop.I give it 4 stars for its evocation of the period and because I like Cate Blanchett. In short, though: beautiful pictures, but a conventional, slow-paced story, and an unfortunate tendency to stoop to stereotypes. Once or twice.",Carol

The cinematography in this film is horrible, and the characters never leave this dimly lit, grey, polluted cityscape throughout the film (their 'roadtrip' consists of only grey roadsides and fugly motels, it's also not clear where exactly they were going or why.) The relationship and overall storyline takes a long time to break through the muck, and even then it remains subtle and flat, not particularly memorable. As I watched the divorce proceedings, I couldn't help but think how, if these were homosexual men who had been filmed at the time, the threat would not be taking away the custody of children, but jailtime.

A simple ""Your perfume smells good"" can means "" I want you"", and the way to look each other can shows a lot meaning behind that. We are on the 1952 and this is story of a lesbian love. Where one person can change the life of the another one, and together can change the life of other people. But to do that, you need to suffer before and this is what can let this love grow. Desire, absence, imagination, eroticism, art. Any details of each shot, can show a new meaning, a new detail that can let you understand a lot go them. It's a love movie. The Carol's love for her daughter, for the sense of life when she is available to decline all the support of her lawyer, because what is really important are love and respect; for the love for the freedom. What two people built together, means more than revenge and malice. And what they built always will remain, and we have to take care of that, because it's the most beautiful part of us. That's what is important. The gay love in an America not ready for that, but so intense to make think about that. The movie is just a bit slow, but it's even the time of loveit requires time to grow, to be experienced and to be part of each other.

205,lloydmorgan111222,A Fine Film That Needs More Character,7,17 January 2016,"'Carol' is a fine film. The juxtaposition of the lavish costumes and production design with the grainy look of 16mm film sells the film's old-fashioned aesthetic. It is a well-shot film that is pleasant to look at. All of the individual performances are pretty good. The best part of the film is the opening sequence. The credits play over a continuing shot of fifties New York accompanied by Carter Burwell's fantastic piece 'Opening'. This shot brings us to a scene in a restaurant. This is a flash-forward that we revisit later on in the film. Our first sight of the main couple occurs when a man at the bar looks around the restaurant and spots them at a table. In this shot, Therese (Rooney Mara) and Carol (Cate Blanchett) are sitting at a table. Therese is sat facing away from the camera and towards Carol, who we can see clearly. My immediate reaction to this sight was ""Wow, Cate Blanchett genuinely looks like she's in love."" It felt real.Unfortunately, I didn't get this feeling from the rest of the film. I couldn't feel any chemistry between Therese and Carol. Mara and Blanchett do their best with what they are given, but they aren't given enough. Their characters don't feel fleshed out. I didn't feel like I knew them as people by the end. The film's technical achievements can only lift a film so high. If you love this film then I'm glad, but I can't love it when I couldn't grow attached to the characters. This is especially a problem as this feels like a film driven more by character than by story.Despite what I have said, this film didn't bore me. Mara and Blanchett are both engaging actresses who command your attention even if they aren't given enough to work with. The film is on the slow side but it goes at the right pace for what director Todd Haynes and screenwriter Phyllis Nagy were going for. Overall, it was an interesting experience that felt a bit empty.You can see more reviews at http://letterboxd.com/lloyd_morgan/films/reviews/",Carol

I don't see any real love between the two women in this story. Lust may be!Passion? If one decided to leave your husband and family for the truth love, one should have the gust and passion to go for it. But when the wife got the telegram she was already behaving like a chicken. When the other woman wanted to have a true love from an affair with a married woman, why could she have just honestly confessed to her boyfriend instead of blaming him annoying her. Nothing has this affair shown or told something beautiful.Chemistry? The casting is not good. I don't know whether the two actress are lesbians, straight or bisexual, there are simply no chemistry between the two. The love scene has shown not much passion too.Five stars is already far too much for this movie.

208,frankimunk,"Very loosely based on the book by Patricia Highsmith, renamed after the film...",10,11 April 2016,"I have read Carol (aka The Price of Salt) so for the purpose of this review, it needs to be understood that a film must be limited to a shortened time by the film board so Nagy has omitted the very essence of the book, rather like skimming through a book so missing details. People ask why the film is called Carol? When the book is Price of Salt...in the book Thereze, while living in Chicago for a long time, has a visit from her best friend Danny having finally achieved his degree has been offered a job in Los Angeles and en route he stops by to ask Thereze if she would move there with him, she considers this but declines, it is in this conversation Danny uses the term Salt. Salt is mentioned twice in the bookThis film is a version of that story because it is brought to life by Cate Blanchett & husband Andrew Upton. Exquisitely filmed, beautifully directed, and crafted with brilliant performances from the three leads, Cate, Rooney Mara, and Sarah Paulson as always. It is more a work of art using accurate details from the fifties, both in costume, props, music and scenery. It matters not that it differs from the book, it isn't meant to be, however if you enjoyed the film, immerse yourself in the book. I admit to havng watched the DVD so many times, each time I enjoy it more, it's just that good. In the end having moved back to New York, needing to return Carols car, and attend a party, where she happens meets a rising star blonde actress who asks her to her suite, she declines and meets Carol to return the car. In the book little is told of Carol, but the film revolves more around Carol, hence the title change and re-released re-naming of the book. The reference to the book being semi-autobiographical is a bit overstated, Highsmith once worked in Bloomingdales dept store during Christmas selling dolls and noticed a woman just like Carol wearing the lush fur coat, golden hair, an air of something special about her. She goes home and writes the outline of a story about her, drawing on personal experience. While ill she reflected on her notes and based the book on just that character, naming her Carol because of Christmas Carol, I have no idea why the husband's name is Hargess! Highsmith had the book published under a pseudonym, Claire Morgan, after which she returned to mysteries and adventure, but doesn't like being a labelled writer.If you have read the book you may feel cheated by this film, but the supreme casting of Rooney Mara, Cate Blanchett & Sarah Paulson do at least express the story extremely well in brief, surprisingly including one very tastseful scene of sexual nature. Also some of the lines from the book are used exactly as written, like flung out of space...Best line:Blanchett 'Just when you think it can't get any worse you run out of cigarettes!'If you have only seen the film and enjoyed it, DO please read the book, which is approx 9 hours of reading, it gives the inside details that will give you a truer insight to this brave 1950s based relationship, back then very illicit. The character Carol goes to great lengths to give Thereze everything, it is an immediately mutual attraction. She even goes to the trouble of buying Thereze her favourite brand of Philip Morris cigarettes for the very many times she stays at Carols house, Abby has separate relationship with Thereze. There is also some humorous insight by Thereze...for example she has been in the car with Carol who seems to always want the windows down, ergo Thereze is always cold, when she is given a late drive home with Abby, the car is open-top sporty flashy cream colour roadster, and her inner thought is 'Another one who like to drive in the open air!' Lastly, or this review will never end...the letter she finally receives is heartbreaking to read.The whole book is told from Thereze' perspective. When Carol leaves her to fly home there is no Abby, in the book she is left only the car, later some money, and eventually Thereze makes a new life in Chicago.The key word in saying this film is based on the book is LOOSELY. So loosely that it's inside out, back to front, missing key information. However that is why most screen adaptions are often disappointing to those familiar with the books. I read this before knowing it would become a film and was really excited to learn of the casting. It was difficult to secure funding and distribution so it took a long time to reach the screen.If you can choose, see the film first, because the books are so much better, that's a book to film standard.Try listening to the book ▶https://mobile.audible.co.uk/pd/Fiction/Carol-Audiobook/B00O3H1AOGEither way, this is a beautiful story be it by film or book, or both.",Carol

This interaction piques both characters' interest in each other.The film is set in post-WW2 New York City and portrays some of the more conservative family values that seemed to be very prevalent around that time.As the plot unfolds, we find that Carol is in a failing marriage to Harge (Kyle Chandler) and has a daughter with him. Harge is a man that comes from a very conservative family that surrounds themselves with the high-society types. Within this dynamic, we see that Carol has been very suffocated for a good part of her marriage to Harge and is striving to break free to find her own individual contentment. He and his family characterize her ""unorthodox"" lifestyle decisions, such as sleeping with other women, as immoral and reprehensible to the point of stalking her and privately filming her in order to use the ""evidence"" in a messy custody battle for their daughter.Other reviews have mentioned that this is a love story, but I saw it as a story of self-realization, with her relationship with Therese as a driving force toward this end. Therese is much younger than Carol and has her entire life ahead of her. She is also on her own journey of self-discovery. Toward the end of the film, we see Therese starting out her own career, through the path that she made for herself. Many of the deeper intricacies of the plot are implied, such as when Carol gifts a nice camera to Therese that tells us she is supportive of Therese's endeavors to go out and make a life for herself - the kind of life that Carol has been looking for her entire life. A life of freedom to do what she wants on her own terms.",Carol
211,kimd-38939,"Beautiful, heartwarming",8,30 January 2018,"I recently watched this movie, and I really liked it! Essentially, the movie explores the romantic relationship that develops between a department store clerk (Therese) and an older elegant woman (Carol). As homosexuality was not widely accepted during the time period of the story, the 1950s, their relationship is kept hidden and is faced with many obstacles.The movie's timing is relatively slow, but that actually enhanced the story line in my opinion; it made the relationship between Therese and Carol flourish at a more natural and realistic pace. I also thoroughly appreciated the beautiful scenery seen throughout the film. The costumes and overall setting designs were phenomenal and definitely reflective of the time period. Cate Blanchett and Rooney Mara, the two leading actresses, both did a superb job at portraying their characters; their passion was extremely evident, and they really embodied their characters in an honest and believable way.I think my only point of contention is with the movie's ending. I personally felt that it was a bit rushed, which somewhat undermines the slow pacing that pervades the rest of the movie. I was left wanting to know more about what happened with their relationship and with the custody battle for Rindy. Nevertheless, the movie did not disappoint, and I highly recommend it!",Carol

I had been avoiding this movie for a long time and now I completely regret watching it after 5 years of its release. I didn't expect the movie to be so beautiful. I was moved by it. I thought it would be a typical cliche love story but oh boi did I know I was wrong. Everything is so beautiful about this movie. Cate and Ronnie have good chemisty together. The tunnel scene was one of the best scene in the whole movie. Their love making scenes were absolutely breathe taking. I could feel their desire and love for each other. This is one of the best love story I have ever watched beside Portrait of Lady on Fire. We need more movies like this!,Carol
214,vissini95,"Interesting concept, mediocre result",6,3 January 2016,"When I saw this movie I knew it's considered one of the best of 2015, and among the favorites for many prestigious awards. The story seemed interesting, and so it was, but the film itself was rather boring.Inspired by a 1950's novel by Patricia Highsmith, Carol portrays an eccentric lesbian love story between two much different women. One of them is the titular character, an elegant woman in her forties whom the experienced and brilliant Cate Blanchett portrays beautifully, especially her sentiments and passions. The other is Therese, a weak and introvert young woman portrayed by Rooney Mara. The two stars of the film play their parts fine, both individually and combined as there seems to be good chemistry between them. However, I strongly believe that the analysis of the characters, both the two women and the others, is not as deep and touching as it could - and should- have been, and the inevitable result is that the viewer fails to identify themselves with anyone. You just sit and watch their adventures and misfortunes, but, other than a mere sympathy, you can't feel much about them, or even for them. Furthermore, both the relationship between the two main characters and their relationships with other people (Carol's family, Therese's boyfriend and few friends) are left unexpanded and unclear.I know that the LGBT subject of the story is very subtle, and it was even more when Highsmith wrote the novel, and it's natural for a film depicting such a story to attract attention. If you have read other novels written by the same author (or watched the film adaptations), such as ""Strangers on a Train"" or ""The Talented Mr. Ripley"", it's nothing of the kind. And that's another fault of the film; while Highsmith's novels are based in suspense, this one fails to attract your interest and make you anxiously wait to see what happens.In the end the result is a decent but mediocre film. Blanchett and Mara, especially the former, do their best but the screenplay is somewhat weak and unable to keep the viewer's attraction. If you can identify yourself with the characters and see ""between the lines"", if there's anything important there, you'll probably like it. Otherwise, there's not much too see. 6/10",Carol

216,ryan-bfd,Unimaginative story of forbidden love,6,29 February 2016,"Carol is set in 1950s New York and is about a young woman, Therese Belivet (Rooney Mara)who falls in love with a middle-aged wealthy divorcée, Carol Aird (Cate Blanchett). In this movie Rooney Mara plays a restrained and very shy character but she tends to open up to Cate Blanchett's lavish and very confident one. I have to say that I didn't really like Cate and Rooney's take on their characters. They didn't feel very realistic or fleshed out enough for me to really get engaged with these characters. It just felt too cliché . Like they were portraying a rough caracecher of their personality types. The art direction and costume design did catch my eye quite a bit. Its interesting to see the subtle details in the architecture and clothing design through out the film. The close ups and framing in a lot of scenes was detailed and well executed but I wouldn't call them beautiful or breath-taking. A lot of the shots seemed to be dull in terms of color. They also lacked ambition in terms of exploring different camera angles and shot setups. The theme of the film was pretty interesting. Two women are sexually attracted and in-love with each other during one of the most conservative time periods in American history. The fact that Carol is so much older then Therese just adds the theme of rebellion in this film. However, this film isn't very bold or straight forward. This is a film is kind of about the repercussions of homosexuality in 1950s. This film could have been much more gritty but it was filtered and cleaned up into something that the typical soccer mom can stomach. It really doesn't fully utilize its R rating. As artful as this film is it failed to actually capture forbidden love in the same way that ""Blue is the Warmest Color"" or ""Brokeback Mountain"" did. This film was essentially a build up into one sex scene between the two main actresses and then the repercussions unfold from there. The only thing that actually kept me engaged was the tension between Carol and Therese. They really take their time to build up the tension between the two leads and keep their audience engaged as these characters are developed throughout this film. I give it a decent 6/10",Carol

I wanted everything to matter more than it actually did. Yes, Blanchett is amazing, and I'm sure the book, when written was important, but there was no fizz.

And this is so important with art (yes, movies are art) but it's not much considered nowadays. The directing was good but it didn't convince me. You can clearly see the big potential of Haynes but I think it could've been used better, or at least pushed a little more. The score was just beautiful. It totally throws you back into the '50s. I loved the different development of the two characters even though, in my opinion, the finale is too quick. It looked like the times of the film are perfect both to create a story and to let the viewer ""interact"" with the protagonists but at the end it's like they didn't have anymore time so they don't give enough space to let things evolve in a natural way.

225,vivaldi-bgd,Perfect,10,20 March 2016,"Carol was so worth waiting for. It exceeded my expectations in all aspects. Hollywood has finally matured in the 'lesbian cinema' category. Everything was finally in place.The story slowly and gradually builds the relationship between two women in a subtle yet very powerful way-there is not much to see on the exterior but we can feel the growing affection right from the very first glance across the room. Miniature gestures, incredibly subtle facial expressions and a lot of eye contact were probably the only ways of expressing one's homosexual love in public in the 1950s. Even now, more than 50 years later, there are corners of this world where people are not allowed to love who their hearts really desire.Todd Haynes masterfully tells this story. Though slow paced, the movie never gets boring and keeps one's attention through every scene.It takes more than one watching of this movie to fully realize the brilliance in Blanchett and Mara's acting. Cate so vividly expresses Carol's attraction to Therese as well as her anxiety on how Therese would react to Carol's feelings. At first, one may be more impressed by Cate's depiction of Carol because she is the dominant one in her actions, appearance and desire whereas Rooney's Therese is shy and wobbly shaken by these new feelings for a woman. However, Rooney's superb acting brings to surface the most intense of feelings Therese has suddenly discovered. The opening scene in the restaurant is a great example of this- when the story makes the full circle and we finally get to see what is going on between Carol and Therese. Rooney keeps her body language so calm and yet we can feel Therese's passion for Carol. Her eyes, breathing and the tone of her voice when talking to Carol as oppose to the intruding guy are simply breathtaking.Carol is a great testament to love between two people irrespective of their gender. It shows that same-sex love is indeed no different in all its aspects than straight love.",Carol
226,tmdaines,Carol (2015 - Todd Haynes): ***½,7,21 March 2016,"I liked this but didn't love it. The film is technically brilliant, almost perfect in fact, yet I remained unmoved throughout. I admired it but I cannot say I embraced it. It was only listening to the Guardian film podcast on the way home that clarified many of my thoughts on the film.Primarily, I struggled to believe in Carol and Therese's relationship as anything that could possibly be long lasting or positive long term. The relationship in my eyes had far more in common with the one in The Diary of a Teenage Girl (2015), whereby an older stepfather takes advantage of his willing, pubescent stepdaughter, than any classic romance. Therese, to me at least, was presented as barely a woman. Rooney Mara is 30 in real life but she comes across as barely 20 here. Whilst the audience is invited to see the lovers' relationship as a blossoming romance, to me it was more akin to a puppy dog love for Therese that forms part of everyone's growing pains. I also couldn't help thinking that were Carol male, then the audience would struggle that much more to see their relationship in such a positive light. It's ironic, but to this modern viewer, the more unsettling aspect was not the sapphic relationship but the vast age difference or, better still, maturity, between an older adult and a young girl.Part of the problem may have been that Blanchett is such a screen presence that she dominates the relationship and every scene that she's in. It's little wonder therefore that Mara comes across as a young waif in comparison. This is admittedly partly intentional and the couple do comprise of clear submissive and dominant roles, but it's too strong for the tone of the film. I think Blanchett is really good; Mara is passable and neither performance certainly comes across as weak, yet there is little chemistry between the two in my eyes, which is what the success of the film hinges upon.So, it comes to the ending. Carol calls Therese back. Therese goes back to Carol. Poor Therese, she'll be heartbroken again in a few weeks, when the dom takes away her love once more.",Carol
227,cornerstorebitch,What Happens When Straight People Make Gay Movies,5,13 January 2016,"Before I ever saw this film, I heard the NPR interview of Cate Blanchett about it. In it, there's a part in which she essentially says that the characters in the movie express ""fluid sexuality"" and that she relates because she has had relationships with women before. I assume that means ""I kissed a girl in college when I was drunk"" but you know. Whatever.The rise of this hyper-progressive gay-but-not flavor of LGBT culture has created a wave of ""gay movies"" (movies created with a gay audience in mind) that try very, very hard not to be Gay Movies. This is evident in the fact that they never actually say lesbian at any point in the film, and Rooney Mara's character essentially says ""I'm not A GAY I'm just a normal girl that happened to fall in love with a woman."" Basically, they want us to shell out money to see this movie because Cate Blanchett has sex with a woman but didn't want to make it Too Gay in case that alienated straight people's money. That movie was the epitome of this and it irritated me throughout the entire movie.That aside, it was technically not a bad movie at all. Lots of pretty shots and the costume designs were great. The performances were strong and while I wasn't overly impressed with the story it wasn't terrible necessarily. A very technically okay movie all in all.Definitely not a bad movie, but not really a good one either. If you want to watch a gay movie with a happy ending check out Boys in the Band, or But I'm a Cheerleader!. Both better movies than this, honestly. And one of them has RuPaul as a main character",Carol
228,Lubezki,Love is a powerful force.,8,20 December 2015,"""Carol"" is the latest film from acclaimed director Todd Haynes and stars Oscar winner Cate Blanchett and Oscar nominee Rooney Mara. It tells the story of an estranged young woman called Therese (Mara) and a glamorous blonde in her mid-thirties named Carol (Blanchett), who develop strong feelings for each other after they meet in a toy store one day. The film relies on both Blanchett and Mara's uncanny ability to display so much with saying very little. Carol is in the middle of a nasty divorce, so her attraction to Therese is part desire and part seeking some sort of comfort. For Therese however, due to her longing for any sort of company, it's pure infatuation. She see's Carol as the flawless angel type, someone whom she feels most at ease with. Mara is terrific as a vulnerable and sheepish individual not quite sure what she wants in life yet. But her admiration for Carol is certainly clear and she projects this through many curious and intense glances and gazes. Blanchett is similar in her approach, a much more understated turn than we're used to seeing from her but the role calls for it, and she's brilliant as per usual. I don't see Blanchett winning an Oscar for this (nomination at best) but Mara is certainly in a prime position to do so.Todd Haynes' direction is very assured, once again demonstrating his confident handling of period pieces.The wonderful production design and costumes instantly transport the viewer to the 1950's era, and Edward Lachman's photography is ravishing. ""Carol"" is a finely crafted love story without bringing much new to the table.

230,baddah,Definitely not one of the best movies of 2015?,4,28 December 2015,"I don't understand why this movies is so overrated, it is a boring love story, the only difference from a usual boring love story is the same-sex concept. The name of Todd Haynes made me expect a movie as emotionally intense as Far From Heaven (2002). Now, I realise it was just wishful thinking. I think Therese Belivet (Rooney Mara) does not fall for Carol (Cate Blanchett), she desires all the riches she possess and this leads her to feel something unexplainable towards Carol, for me that seems definitely not love. Whatever it is, it should have been described more thoroughly. Only after a short period of time both characters are presented to us, they start to love each other, and to prove they're in love, they move slowly, and as if that was the real thing, toward the moment when they share the same bed, have sex. That's OK with me but where is passion, where is love, and why so quick we don't know anything about the characters. To sum up, I was absolutely disappointed because in no way Carol met my expectations. The story telling makes it difficult to understand what is going on; when and how those people fell in love, the husband who is he, why does he want Carol back even though he knows her preferences and she does not love him, the lover of Therese he suddenly comes into the scene then disappears, and lots of similar pointless stuff. Costumes are great, though. And finally, please stop taking part in projects you don't believe in with only the intention of getting an award.

They lacked charisma, chemistry or passion even when angry, desperate and in love. So unlikable were the characters that I was unable to raise a single shred of empathy even when things were uncomfortable and unpleasant for them.

The storyline soon gets going and although not that much happens, you don't get bored and want to see the story to its conclusion. I think this is due the brilliance of both Cate Blanchett and Rooney Mara. They absolutely shine in this film. This film would not be anywhere near as good with out them in it especially in light of the fact that most of the movie is just scenes between the two of them.

234,kazanipouvrazei,"Such movies scarce in our times, don't you agree?",10,11 December 2015,"Offering a magical combination of atmosphere, bold script and accurate performances, you would have to search back in the era of Classic Hollywood, to make the relevant comparisons. I'm betting, it will break your heart. Carol Aird (Cate Blanchett) is an attractive woman of the '50s. She's also on the eve of her upcoming divorce with her husband (Kyle Chandler). The latest victim of her seductive manners is an introvert young woman in a mall. Therese Belivet (Rooney Mara) wants to break free from a dead-end relationship with her boyfriend and searches for something else. Something, she cannot share to anybody.This is the kind of drama, which does not care only for its heroes, but for the world and the changing rules. Carol respects and appreciates women's fight for equal rights and beyond a romantic love story at its core, spreads a great amount of feminist dynamism in the story (based on Patricia Highsmith's The Price of Salt). What we are given here, is a familiar but –admittedly- fascinating narrative line. Two souls, not as tortured as in Brokeback Mountain's gay couple, but with emotions at similar level expressed, make a journey of self-discovery and acceptance, through their difficult choices and dilemmas. It is a painful procedure of self- awareness and it plays wonderfully in the interplay of the characters, as if you can feel the cracks before the sudden sound.Todd Haynes (director of Far from Heaven), continues his wanderings in the land of forbidden passions, now with a greater sense of romance, taste and technical knowledge. Displaying again his foolproof criteria on choosing the crème de la crème of associates (in editing, cinematography, costume and production design) he brings an almost fetish quality in the way people, color and objects are positioned in his frames. But thanks to his talent and gusto, this effect is not been used with a cold stylish approach. It gives the whole set, an elegant, warm and extremely emotional value. What is left to say for Blanchett's talent? Her instinct, look, voice, and physical complexion is unbeatable. An electrical performance, from start to finish. More touching though, here is Mara, and the way she lets herself to get carried away. The normality of her restraint as an actress is what makes her, the most suitable person for the role.

236,loobeyloo,It was alright.,7,26 July 2020,"Initially I wasn't really that interested in this film, cos 1 - it seemed a bit middle of the road, didn't seem to have much spark to it personality-wise. And 2 - it looked really white, and I've cumulatively seen way, WAY too many monocultured white films. Then a little later, out of desperation for gay content in my life, got this subsequent urge to watch any and all lgbtq+ movies I could find. THAT'S what brought the film back to my attention, and birthed this imdb list.And in terms of cinema, it is a beautifully-shot, emotionally tense feature. Carol is majestic as all hell, and definitely has ""Big Dick Energy"". really she makes the film. However, a lot of the drama relies too heavily on subtext to really get you going in my opinion. And it's so white, which at this point in 21st century cinema, forms part of a trend that, given all we know, is statistically just inexcusable.I don't like the idea of LGBTQ+ films having a gay relationship as the only point of the story. It's such a simplistic and frankly quite straight perspective, and I just find it patronising. Of course straight people are going to think queer sexualities are the most interesting thing about us.As a queer person, I definitely know our lives are more complex than that. There's queer friendship, there's finding your personality, there's chosen family, there's navigating academia, there's music, there're unique perspectives on sexism, on the working world...

Since both movies talk about love relationship between two women, I was afraid I was going to see the same thing. Gladly, I couldn't be more wrong. Carol is such a beautiful movie, subtler than I had expected.Even though I loved the movie, I'm aware that it's not for everybody. It's not fast paced, as current films tend to be. It takes its time to carefully construct the characters and to make us root for them. Credit is due to the cast, as Cate Blanchett and Rooney Mara are brilliant, and to the director Todd Haynes, who conducts well the story.Moreover, the film is visually stunning, with impeccable make-ups and wardrobes, not to mention the beautiful locations covered in snow while they take a road-trip.

238,efren_aa,Charming recreation... and that's it,5,9 December 2018,"What a beautiful looking movie! When it's about historic dramas it's very hard to beat the fifties, especially those as well made and with so much passion and elegance put in as this. Not only captures the era, or at least what I have romanticized as it, but it lets it shine with a subtlety that very few productions manage to achieve. Compare this with the over reliance of Elizabeth: The Golden Age's (which casts the same star in the lead role) bombastic scenography, set and costume design and there's no way you don't prefer Carol. Anyway, the director's work is quite pleasant, to say the least; a very contained atmosphere, something I consider appropriate, a good management of space given the circumstances, and a slow yet enchanting progression through the story. The bad thing is the writing, which is poor most of the time and barely mediocre on its high points. Almost at the end there's some kind of monologue which arguably tried to be touching and heart-breaking but it's just meh, and that's something that defines the whole experience. Tough luck to the director, I guess, even with the performance of his actors and actresses, especially Cate Blanchett, to whom I didn't believe a single minute. Rooney Mara's decent enough, and the rest are ok, but ultimately irrelevant.

240,shihanyu,"Beautiful, intelligent, simple but distinct",9,25 May 2017,"Absolutely beautiful shots, simple but distinct and meaningful. Overall, the film does an amazing job of showing character development.Outstanding, intelligent acting by both Cate Blanchett and Rooney Mara. Blanchett clearly shows the character's sophistication and flirtatiousness through her body posture and verbal delivery. Mara's acting is a great portrayal of a nervous but excited mix of emotions. Her hand gestures and motions are filmed brilliantly, and she does an amazing job of showing the absentminded, unconscious behaviors of an emotional person.Director Todd Haynes especially likes shots through car windows and mirrors to show the viewer the characters' sense of being lost in thought and self reflection.The Super 16 mm film is noteworthy and gives the movie a different texture that corresponds to the 1940s/1950s time period, as does the costume design.Symbols worth noting are cigarettes, mirrors, photographs, and hands. Cigarettes show the character's anxiousness, frustration, as well as flirtation. Mirrors show self reflection and thought. Photographs help the characters to slowly grasp their emotions as they develop, and hands show the delicateness and gentleness of love.",Carol

I love the beautiful feeling between them, subtle but unforgettable! I thought I would cry before I watched it but it turned that I didn't.

244,alexlangholm,A disappointing film with very little emotional content,4,8 December 2015,"**WARNING: Contains plot spoilers**I don't normally write reviews but this is a case where the critics seem to be totally disconnected from what they are supposed to be reviewing. It is weird to see so little dissent in the press about this film. Carol has many good points but more bad points.The good points are the amazing production design and costumes, and the interesting 16mm cinematography (which does get quite grainy at times). The technical side of things is fine, it looks very beautiful and old-fashioned.The main problem is that there just isn't any emotional connection established between the two main characters, or between anyone really. The film doesn't make you care about people or their fates, and doesn't explain why they would care about each other.The very first meeting between Carol and Therese highlights this. Carol tries to seduce Therese because... well, she just does, from the very first moment she lays eyes on her in the department store. We don't know why, Carol has never met her before so presumably it's just because Therese is young and pretty. We don't even see Carol reacting to Therese's beauty, Carol just has this predatory gaze from the very first frame, as if she was determined to find someone, anyone. How much sympathy would we feel for a middle-aged married man doing these things instead of Carol?Because of the way the story unfolds, it is also very hard to shake the feeling that Carol is a rich person who is, in the end, able to get whatever she wants.There ought to be sympathy for Carol being stuck in a dead marriage, but she is getting divorced and already having an affair.There ought to be sympathy for Carol losing custody of her daughter Rindy, but we never really see the mother-daughter relationship enough to understand what this means to her. For example, in the first scene Carol buys her daughter a train set instead of a doll in order to impress the young shop assistant that she lusts after. We later see Carol playing with the train set by herself while thinking of her own problems, we never see the daughter using it. The daughter seems to be little more than a plot device or a prop.There ought to be sympathy for gay lovers being parted by a bigoted 1950s society, but we never really see them as lovers. We see them make love, but there isn't really a scene where they display any kind of chemistry or deep affection. They come together because... well, they just do. To make matters worse, they split up almost as soon as they have got together, so we don't really get the time to feel anything significant has been lost.The saddest part is when Carol dumps Therese so she can go to fight for her daughter's custody, but then when, thanks to her lawyer's manoeuvrings, Carol has a realistic chance of getting joint custody of her daughter, she waives her rights to it. Why? Because it means she can avoid the hassle of a nasty court case. How deep can Carol's love for Rindy or Therese really be if these are her priorities? And why tell us that the custody of Rindy means so much, more than her love for Therese, and then show her abandoning custody? Perhaps the novel explains why this makes sense, but the film certainly doesn't.The two hour running time should have been long enough to get proper emotional connections built up, but instead the director squanders it on overextended scenes that should have been much shorter. It makes the whole film drag on without any character development.At one point Carol's husband Hodge has a door slammed in his face, it ends on a nice shot of his partially-covered features, but it then goes on to show him walking away from the house, getting in a car and driving off. Extending the scene didn't serve any purpose, we know he's annoyed and isolated but he's been annoyed and isolated for the entire film. Another example has Carol and Therese arriving in a hotel, they enter the lobby, they enter the room, they admire the room and then... it cuts to them leaving the hotel. What did we learn about them from this? That they enjoy the decor of expensive hotels? Wouldn't, for example, adding a scene earlier in the film showing Carol doing nothing but playing with her daughter Rindy been a better way to build up the emotional stakes?""Carol"" seems to be the kind of film where the subject matter and the reputation of the participants has totally replaced objective assessment of the work itself.Gay rights are important, Blanchett is a great actor and Haynes is a great director. ""Carol"" is not an important or great film though, it's telling the story of an affair without telling us why the affair happened or why we should care. Its reviews seem to be based on what ""Carol"" should have been, rather than what it actually is.",Carol
245,Arvo_Diri,Average,5,3 March 2016,"First my opinion of the movie without the lesbian theme.Great cinematography. The reconstitution of the 50's was perfect. Splendid work.The adaptation of the novel however was terrible. As another reviewer very aptly said, the novel lines that are in the mind of the director are rendered through long pauses and stares. You are supposed too guess the lines when that happens.The directing makes it worse. Both lead actresses seem to play in different movies, answer to different people, react to different situations. You don't understand how the passion evolves from the movie only. The stages and pace of the relationship are not explained.Now the lesbian theme.I am surprised that it was unconditionally applauded by most LGBT reviewers. In fact it could be understood as as much homophobic as liberal. It revives the myth of the lesbian as a predator. Carol is a mature lady who seduces an inexperienced girl. Carol is a wealthy lady who seduces a poor employee. Also the acting by Cate Blanchett is explicitly predator- ish, and the acting by Rooney Mara explicitly victim-ish.The exposition of the judicial trouble facing lesbians at the time is ambiguous as well. The husband and the lawyer are presented as very moderate. In fact you could almost root for them, in the context of the time. Carol is not placed in an insane asylum, she will keep her wealth and have the good life. She does not really lose her daughter either, the daughter is not placed in an orphanage. And Carol will be able to see her all the time when the daughter is of age. Plus Carol is not shown as very determined to keep her daughter eventually.The whole results in a dull and morally too cautious movie. No sides are taken, no passion is really dealt with. Very ambiguous.",Carol
246,allan-costa,The wonderful Cate Blanchet under-appreciated,4,31 October 2017,"Carol is a film that tells the story of a middle-aged woman who has a marriage of appearances (from which she wants to get rid through a divorce), and has a romance with a clerk (Rooney Mara). Both are fine but not stunning. Cinematography is very good, costume design is excellent. But the story becomes childish, totally linear and unimaginative. The film does not escape the most innocent clichés. The script is entirely predictable. Cate can do much better than this. 4 out of 10",Carol

249,Lazyl,Beautiful But Too Subtle--And Not Positive At That,5,7 May 2016,"Visually, production-wise, musically: a wonderful and enigmatic view of early 1950s America. I loved the clothes, the light, the reflections, the cars.Emotionally, unfortunately I didn't care much one way or the other about the characters' needs, loves, wants, or desires. This in spite of beautiful performances by Cate Blanchett and Rooney Mara.**Spoilers below**: About half-way through the film, I thought Carol was simply a rich woman who used everyone around her: her former lover, her estranged husband, her new girl-toy, even her child, to attempt to make herself feel something. When the film didn't go that way, I was surprised. I suppose it could be seen as that anyway: At the end, is Carol's expression one of love or one of the conquering vamp? Who knows? I didn't really care.As for Therese, I wish she would say ""yes"" to something more interesting. As a matter of fact she did say ""no"" during her life: to a young man who she led along far too long before she escaped a dreary and predictable if safe relationship.On the whole, this film does not put women in a very positive light. The characters seem lost, in all aspects of their lives, and they seek to posit something real in their experiences through a love affair that, in the end, seems mostly about selfish people getting what they think will make them happy--even in the face of evidence that it will not.Disappointed. I looked forward to this film very much. Someday, perhaps, we will have a non-cisgender love story that actually has some joy in it. And ends not with a scene completely open to interpretation, but one of the wholeness and satisfaction of shared love.",Carol
250,mattr1198,"A Slow Paced, Run-of-the-mill Oscar Bait Movie",4,13 September 2015,"Having seen Carol in pre-screenings, I can say that it is a typical film that's only purpose is to win awards. It did not entertain me very much, especially because of its very slow pace. However, the film does well when it comes to the acting. Kate Blanchett and Rooney Mara are both fantastic, but that doesn't make up for the other lackluster aspects of the film. The story could have been done better and, again, part of this is due to its slow pacing. Additionally, Carol, unfortunately, tries to ""pull a boyhood"" by promoting its 11 year development period, which, in turn, will increase a critical response as it will look as if more effort were put into the film.Don't trust the critics, Carol isn't that special. Many other films currently out, like Steve Jobs and Inside Out should be given more love than this movie.",Carol
251,lukas-meister,The Art of Filmmaking,9,29 February 2016,"I think ""Carol"" is the kind of movie that only Cineasts will truly appreciate. I am not writing this with a disrespectful intention, it is just the way it is from what I've seen in different review sections. There is nothing bad about saying ""this is not my cup of tea,because.."", but I've seen a lot of people who try to deny and discredit this films visual and musical beauty as well as the impeccable directing. I was inclined to give this a 10 if it wasn't for some flaws in credibility and character relationships. This is the kind of storytelling and directing where you have to fully invest yourself into it, you have to pay attention to the details and the nuances in every aspect. One of these aspects is the incredible acting, lead by Cate Blanchett. Her performance is by far the best in the movie, she is simply put the perfect fit for her character. It is hard to explain, her portray of Carol just felt so real. This story focuses on characters and their relationships, so there are no true outbursts of wild and loud acting. Its the details in facial expression and gestures that make the movie and actors credible. Rooney Mara is also good, but relies on her beautiful face and eyes a little too much. That said, she does make you feel for her in terms of the difficult and emotionally confusing situation she is in. You can sense the chemistry between them, because Maras character is not searching for any kind of relationship. It just happens to her, and its shown in (almost) visual poetry. The rest of the cast is a perfect addition to the main storyline, especially Kyle Chandler. The splendid cinematography, lighting and directing make the 1950s come back to life. Everything from the costume design to the makeup and music is so detailed that I knew someone put a lot of effort and, most importantly, love into it. The movie is also giving us a great impression of the 1950s conformity and the situation of gay people without going overboard and trying to make you feel bad for them in this aspect. It is very subtle and does not tell you how you're supposed to feel. The only thing that weakened the films impact was the relationship between Carol and her daughter which was not presented in a convincing way and made a decision in the later stages of the film a little questionable. There is one last thing that makes this a wonderful experience: The soundtrack by Carter Burwell. It is a stroke of genius! I cant recommend it enough. It is one of the most fitting pieces of film music in recent years and, in my opinion, the best one this season. Amazing. I absolutely admire the passion and subtlety of ""Carol"", it is a visual and cinematic magnum opus. The acting and screenplay is fantastic, I highly recommend it. Thank you for reading",Carol
252,semery56,Art for More Than Art's Sake,9,15 February 2016,"Carol is an elegant creation, an honest examination of the difficulties of love, the most endearing of all human emotions. Movies about love abound, of course, but few manage to engage the subject with integrity, often resorting to absurd premises, ridiculous plot twists or more often than not, unreasonable melodrama. Carol approaches the subject with caring attention to the authentic and detailed vagaries of human emotion without resort to diversions that subtract from hard truths.Todd Haynes's film concerns the early 1950s attraction between a middle-aged New York woman, Carol Aird (Cate Blanchett), pursuing a divorce from her businessman husband, Harge (Kyle Chandler) and a younger, shy department store saleswoman, Therese Belivet (Rooney Mara). Harge still loves Carol, and is dismayed by her recent affair with a third woman, Carol's friend Abby (Sarah Paulson) and by Carol's lost affections for him. The situation is further complicated by the fact that Carol and Harge have a little girl, Rindy, whom they both obviously love very much, and by the fact that Therese has strung along a young man, Richard (Jake Lacy), who loves her. Carol and Therese feel an initial attraction when Carol seeks a Christmas gift for Rindy in Therese's department. After Carol intentionally forgets her gloves on the store counter for Therese to return, the interactions between them become more frequent, leading to deeper attraction, and with that, difficulties with the men involved in the situation. The key plot accelerator involves Carol's determination not to accompany Harge to his family's home for Christmas activities. When Harge takes Rindy to these festivities while Carol refuses to go, Carol then invites a willing Therese to drive west with her to find some freedom along the road, and to explore the depths of their feelings for one another. Events that occur on this trip drive the eventual decisions by the four individuals involved, all of which are presented honestly by Haynes and writer Phyllis Nagy, who has adapted the screenplay from Patricia Highsmith's novel The Price of Salt. The film attends respectfully to the confusion, the sense of rejection and the sadness of the key male characters - and both Chandler and Lacy express the pain with a proper balance of conflicting emotions. Their anger is evident, but restrained. However, the film never loses its primary focus; this is the story of Carol and Therese, who captivate us in every scene in which they are together.Blanchett and Mara are terrific in developing the relationship in a suitably restrained fashion, true to their differences in age, personality and circumstances, yet also true to their hearts. Blanchett is the seemingly more confident and assured as the older woman, but conveys her insecurities and doubts in unobtrusive ways, sparing us the falseness of on-screen breakdowns. Her inner conflict between pursuing the adult love of which she feels increasingly less trepidation and the realization of a diminished relationship with her daughter is profoundly present to all viewers, but the tension is not unduly examined by either Haynes or Blanchett. Blanchett is at the top of her formidable creative powers throughout this film, consistently true and balanced and engaging. Mara is extremely convincing as the young woman who, while seemingly not entirely sure of herself, is nonetheless determined to chart her own path, whether that involves love that is true to her nature, or pursuit of her artistic and professional goals. She grows on the screen as the film progresses without losing her fundamental personality. This is not a transformation, but rather a more halting and careful self-realization and fulfillment for a woman asserting control of her existence. The costuming and set designs are marvelous evocations of postwar New York, but unlike Haynes's Far From Heaven, the use of the brighter palette is not excessive, and the colors are not over-saturated or insistent. Ed Lachman's cinematography complements the sets and costumes beautifully, while also effectively capturing the constraints on homosexuality in early '50s America. Conversations are in tight frame, and the lighting is fittingly medium wattage but not dim. This is a respectable love, after all, conducted discretely but not in the shadows. Windows are effectively used to depict the look-but-don't-touch sexual mores of the time, and the possibility of love lost, and reflections help reveal truth of character and identity - but these symbols are not overused.The film is well-paced, with relatively short scenes that both convey emotional weight and move the plot without being either overwrought or rushed. The score, by Carter Burwell, provides the appropriate balance between emotional gravity, social tension and the hopefulness of love. Carol is a film that fires on all cylinders. It thoughtfully uses all the tools of classic cinema to present interesting and realistic human characters in difficult emotional situations, framed by significant social strictures. The entire cast and crew, led by director Todd Haynes, has gifted us with a film that will stand the test of time despite Oscar snubs for the movie and its director. It is as genuine and beautiful a love story as I, for one, have seen.",Carol
253,maubaboon,An emotionally shallow relationship,6,30 March 2020,"""I always spend New Year's alone. In crowds."" Therese Belivet.A technical achievement and beautifully acted by both Blanchett and Mara. Individual characterization is very good and interesting (despite some overdramatized scenes and some not so great acting by the male characters). But the main problem I had with this film was the development of their relationship. The two are often sitting in silence even in the latter half of the movie. The only true signs of romantic affection we see between the characters is when they have sex, making their relation seem quite superficial. Considering the ratings from the critics I was expecting something great, especially since good romantic movies are very hard to come by. But I left feeling disappointed.",Carol
254,theveneficus,A sweet and thoughtful look at 'hidden love' in the 50's.,8,23 March 2016,"For me the one scene that can be used to describe the situation that Therese (Rooney Mara) is in, is when she's talking to her 'sort-of' boyfriend Richard (Jake Lacy) about homosexuality. She asks him ""Have you ever been in love with a boy."" His reaction is not offensive or cruel, its just how most people behaved 60 years ago. Of course he says no, and tells her he's 'heard of people who do things like that, but don't know any'. He does now. On the surface Therese is a walled off, stoic shopkeeper with a passion for photography. She lives alone, is undecided about Richard, and seeks something she doesn't understand just yet. This is until Carol (Cate Blanchett) walks into her shop. They fit together like a puzzle of a bird ready for flight, and in little time are on the road together fleeing their old lives. Most of the time Carol works perfectly. The love between them feels real, and organic. You can see why they need each other. The performances are superb with Cate Blanchett, at times, giving a blissful show, and other times a distressing exhibition of how trapped her character is. One of the best directed films of 2015. And probably the best film their is about lesbianism.",Carol

As a gay man ""of a certain age"" I felt deep gratitude for the gift given by the artists who created this film. The direction is so subtle and effective, using the all the tools of film making to communicate information, meaning, and emotion.Like Brokeback Mountain, this film turns cliché on its head and transcends the particulars of the protagonists' lives by illuminating more universal themes. It is a period/genre film that acts to balance well established tropes of its genre, a powerful corrective to SO MANY previous films that repeated the same old false, stereotypical, and often tragic images of gay lives. Beyond merely telling some real truth, Carol has so much to say about strength, resilience, and the possibility of finding joy in difficult circumstances. As such, it was deeply satisfying to this viewer.",Carol

Both are brilliant in the film.Again as with the book, I thought the plot was spot on and the script was rather a good one. But at times a bit slow and maybe not as intense as it potentially could have been as there was clearly chemistry. And heck I'm gonna say it, not enough rudey time on screen.

Carol published on 2015, and I would consider one of the best lesbian movies of all time. When I finishes this movie, I had a sense of utopia of the two main character. They choose to use this amazing road trip to explore the love and each other. Just like Brokeback Mountain, when the director to portray love beyond gender, people will truly understand the love between Carol and Therese. When Therese says "" If I never know to say no, how can I understand I truly want."" at the break up scene, she does not know she already turns down to his boyfriend's Europe trip, boyfriend's proposal, and Danny's kiss. The only thing she cannot say no is the feeling about Carol. These background story's time is around 50's, maybe this relationship is impossible for them.

261,crazyf_ker,A slow burn of the times. Stunning.,8,13 January 2016,"So many people have reviewed this movie without any knowledge of the times, the writer, the book and, I have to note, what it was to be homosexual in an era that could see you end up involuntarily committed and having electro-convulsive therapy. To this I say, yes, it is slow at many points but if you go to watch it knowing that it is 1950-52, you also know that McCarthyism is ruling the land on 'subversion' and it can be no other way. The slow burn is exactly what I expected. If you go to watch it with this in mind, you will not be disappointed.Many reviewers have called Carol a predator and that there was nothing in the meeting in the store other than Carol getting what she wanted. So you just casually met your partners did you and weren't attracted to them until they did something extraordinary for you?? They both saw each other and wanted each other. At no time did I feel Carol was a predator. I thought they were both getting exactly what they wanted.Some reviewers have criticised the happy ending as such a thing would not have happened in the 1950s. Once again, I feel that these reviewers are only showing their ignorance of homosexuality and history. Books of the time did not have happy endings because society didn't accept that there could be happy endings. In real life there were many happy endings. The book was a seminal piece by Patricia Highsmith, for many reasons, but it was the first lesbian novel to have a happy ending. I am both elated, that I got to feel first hand what it would have been like back then, but grateful that I was born in a more accepting time.The movie was slow, this I can't deny, but taken in context, based on a book written in the times the movie portrays, the movie was stunning.

262,masteroftofu,a dull lifeless collection of overused shots and slower than snail storytelling,1,20 December 2015,"I dunno if the people reviewing this even saw the same film, or if they're just studio execs boosting their own movies reviews for the sake of winning the upcoming awards, but this movie is garbage. Far from being academy award winning imo.Cinematography: The director repeats the same shots of someone making overdramatic facial expressions through frosted glass through the entire film. It loses its effect after the 10th time, and by the end of the film its just plain annoying. As far as crafting a 50sesque feel, they succeeded. This film even looks like it was made in the 50s. Unlike the ever famous Madmen though, this is not a good thingStorytelling: As I said in the summary line, this story moves slower than a snail caught in tar. From the getgo, it becomes obvious there is a lesbian affair going on here, but for the next hour plus, the plot never develops into anything more than this. In fact, we never even see any actual physical romance between the 2 leads.Acting: I felt it got over the top a few times. Kate Blanchett is the type of actress that forgets shes not on the Broadway theater when shes doing cinema, and it can be really ridiculous at times. This is one of those times.

The screen play was unique. Cate Blanchett's act simply blew me away. and next to that Rooney Mara's act made it so wonderful. but the most greatest thing about this production was the score. when it starts with a simple piano followed by violin... and then suddenly... the sound of harp. only 5 notes... the most brilliant score of this year. it completely moves you with the story. i can honestly say you can not find anything wrong about this production. everything was perfect. the act, the music, production design, makeup, costumes, screenplay and etc. i can say simply wonderful.",Carol

But with perhaps the only exception of changing Therese's profession to something more modern, every change made from the book to the movie made it a weaker story.I won't get into the details to avoid spoiler tags, but honestly, there are better, older lesbian films.

Like looking through an old photo album from the 1950s, beautifully shot.Narratively, it was an utterly predictable story, without a single twist, every plot point telegraphed and seen miles in advance.Rooney, reminiscent of a beautifully boyish young Demi Moore, was quite good, though her character's relationship to the boyfriend Richard was not particularly nuanced. A little more ambivalence on her character's part toward the relationship would've created some needed tension.Blanchet was interesting, but in a one-dimensional kind of way. She was beautiful, but her manner and delivery seemed superficial and artificial. I'm a bit undecided as to whether these were traits with which she was intentionally trying to imbue the character of Carol, or whether this is how she plays all her characters.This is a mainstream drama, a vehicle for the stars to garner Oscar nominations.

It may be the romanticism of years past; the 1950s always presents this sort of seduction in both color schemes, strictness and forbidden behavior. Carol is a story about women, a story about bonds and, above all, a story about complicated love. It was so beautiful, I haven't stopped thinking about it since I saw it last weekend.Like any good film, there is both tremendous performances rife with humor and style, as well as cool imagery that will leave you wanting to transport back in time. Set in New York 1950s, you meet department store clerk Therese, who, in one glance, falls under the spell of an older, married woman Carol and, well, the rest you'll have to see for yourself!",Carol
267,jan-scheidtweiler,Intelligent and sensitive,8,24 January 2016,"There's so much to enjoy in this gem of a movie. Of course, there's the stellar performance of Ms Rooney and Ms Blanchett, and the way the story talks to us not only about the love of two women. But it also evokes an era, not that long ago, in which lesbian love was quite problematic. The way Mr Haynes kicks the early 1950's back to life is impressive - even although it appears he got some minor details wrong. Another minor criticism might be that almost every male in the movie comes across as a caricature, in stark contrast with the psyche of the two main characters. This is an intelligent, sensitive movie! As a bonus for lovers of sensual scenes, one might add that Carol contains a lesbian sex scene that is both very beautiful and deeply intense...",Carol
268,helen-51122,Carol Disappoints: Empty and Mundane,2,21 December 2015,"The movie ""Carol,"" a lesbian romantic drama that is based on the book ""The Price of Salt"" by Patricia Highsmith, is getting named Best Film of the Year by just about everyone, it seems, and making all the award short-lists. And Helen is Highly disappointed. Let me add up front that the film was costumed by Sandy Powell, art directed by Jesse Rosenthal, and filmed by Edward Lachman, who will all likely (and deservingly) receive awards for their work here. But I have issues with director Todd Haynes and screenwriter Phyllis Nagy. I saw ""Carol"" at the New York Film Festival, where just about every film was more interesting than this gigantic slice of Boring. After watching the film, I assumed most people would dislike it as much as I did, so I was shocked when I did a quick Google search and saw the Variety review pop up saying ""High expectations don't quite prepare you for the startling impact of Carol, exquisitely drawn, deeply felt"" No way! My first order of business is to change Variety's intro line: ""High expectations don't quite prepare you for"": the slow emptiness of this mundane, overly precious, pointlessly detailed movie.Listen, I adore Cate Blanchett as much as anyone. And no one can say she is not gorgeous. At one point in the film – at a party, her estranged husband concedes to her that she is the most beautiful woman in the room. Well, that never changes. She is the most beautiful and the best dressed and best groomed person in every scene. So, let's all agree to put Cate Blanchett's face in the dictionary under the word Perfection, and then we can all go home and save ourselves two hours of lifeless artifice. And if Cate were selling lipstick, or stockings, or fur coats, I would buy them all. But I would not recommend this movie to anyone. I'm happy for Cate that she got such a glamorous star vehicle in which to show off. But why is no one else stating the obvious – that this is essentially a vanity project for Cate Blanchett? Unfortunately however, in this movie, we cannot see Cate's rich inner life through her the heavy cover of makeup and fur. Remember the episode on ""Mad Men,"" where Don Draper is trying desperately to find the ideal, alluring model to put in his fur coat ad? Todd Haynes' Cate Blanchett should get that job! She is precisely what Don was looking for – an impossibly beautiful fantasy of aspirational glamor and exquisite opulence. Women want to be her and men want to have her exactly because she is so flawless and empty; you feel nothing for her as a character – no complicated emotions to ruin the high-gloss illusion. And honestly, Cate, you are better than this; you don't need to advertise your quintessential (surface) beauty. That Don Draper gig, and this movie, are beneath you; you can act. This brings me to the lesbian theme of the story. Helen Highly objects to the portrayal of Carol and her younger lover (played by Rooney Mara) as a Hollywood male fantasy of woman-on-woman sexuality. Due to Haynes' decision to maintain the look-and-feel of a 1950s flick, the movie refrains from overtly explicit sex scenes, but still it has the tone of cheesy pin-up porn – made for men, and not about real-life women who have ambiguous thoughts and difficult feelings. Highsmith's 1953 book, ""The Price of Salt,"" became a lesbian-romance cult-novel, due largely to its being the first authentic expression of lesbian love that did not have the punishing ending that was prescribed by 1950s morality. Highsmith was a lesbian herself (a fact she denied throughout most of her career), and this story is semi-autobiographical, telling the tale of when she was a shop girl who fell into a romantic obsession over an older married woman who was a customer at the store. But let's stop there for a moment. (Well, there's not much else to tell; the movie mostly repeats variations of the first scene.)So many people are eager to say how this film is ""important for women"" – as if it were still the act of sexual bravery and social revelation it was in the 1950s. And that is simply not the case. Today, the storyline is outdated. The book was ground-breaking and radical; the movie is conventional and banal. And this is the fault of the screenplay, which does not capture the emotional intensity or poetic eroticism of the book. The book meticulously detailed the interior lives of these two, passionate yet confused women; the film, instead, meticulously and ploddingly details a story that was only loosely referenced in the book (because Highsmith was interested in tortuous desire and fearful loneliness, not a who-gets-the-kid divorce case). In the movie that Nagy and Haynes made, the tale becomes a simplistic, self-righteous, politically-correct after-school-movie. Haynes attempts, it seems, to depict the women's emotions with an endless series of long, still- life gazes. And so it seems that Haynes cares more about his visual style than he does the psychology of his characters. And to those who like to say that ""Carol"" is comparable to ""Strangers on a Train,"" I say: Yes, Hitchcock and Highsmith shared an affection for frosty blonds (perhaps Todd Haynes does as well). But Haynes is no Hitchcock. (And ""Carol"" is no thriller.) Hitchcock knew how to make an ice-queen come alive on the screen, BUT he also understood plot; he knew what was a compelling story and what was not. ""Carol"" is not. So, Cate Blanchett and Todd Haynes can wish she were Grace Kelly or Kim Novak all day long, but she's not going to touch a hair of their blond locks with this script and this director.",Carol
269,suziesilverado,Very mediocre,3,1 January 2016,"The film was beautiful, but there was barely a plot and it was soooo slow. It was hard to relate to the characters who were very stereotyped and not very sympathetic. Carol was predatory, and it was hard to see what actually drew her to her ""newfound"" love, and vice versa. The only thing the two had in common was being pretty. Carol was practically a pedophile who found a naive victim (this would be unacceptable in a heterosexual relationship, but is somehow acceptable here). Sarah Paulson is a great actress but her character was shallow and never developed. I found the film to be very boring and fell asleep towards the end. Granted, I saw the last show of the day, but I doubt I would have enjoyed it more if I went to the matinée.",Carol

I'll keep this short but you could say so much about this film. I've seen it maybe 15 times and it still has the same effect on me.The cast is stunning and so perfect. Cate Blanchett is obviously iconic and can play any role, but just seems to fit Carol so well. Mara, Paulson and Chandler are also A+. The SOUNDTRACK... breath taking. Carter Burwell has truly done it again. Chuck a few 50s classics in there and you literally can't beat it. Cinematography, set design, costume, script - all amazing.

The two films, released in 1985 and 2015 -- 30 years apart -- are rich and resonant images of the novels, The Price of Salt/Carol (1952, Patricia Highsmith) and The Desert Of The Heart (1964, Jane Rule).These two masterpieces of love between women have shown us that love...is love. Both end with the vast potential that a so-called forbidden love can exist in our society without the participants succumbing to the usual portrayal of petty jealousy, self-hatred, or familial or social pressure; that two people can find a way to live their lives as healthy and loving individuals as well as a pairing of romantic passion, commitment and brave perseverance against seemingly insurmountable odds.The screenwriters' adaptations of both books -- Phyllis Nagy, for Carol, and especially Natalie Cooper, for Desert Hearts -- are heroic and offer simple and splendid revelations of the relationships between two very different women, how their lives intersect and how they find a path to each other regardless of the stilted and suffocating mores of their time.",Carol
272,kylanthewriter,Wonderful performances to be experienced and a simple story to be heard,8,14 October 2020,"I decided to watch this movie on a plane from Toronto to Calgary. Main reasons being; I needed to see Cate Blanchett and Rooney Mara's performance since they got nominated for an Oscar and all, but even more so because this was a movie about two women who loved each other in a not so liberal time. It was slated to be significant for LGBTQ+ community and so to be interested in this movie and to praise it, reflects your left wing, equality seeking righteousness. I want to be viewed that way. I want to have watched this movie and loved it so that one day when I'm talking to someone and they bring it up I could say, ""It was a prodigious movie. A unique look at lesbians in a significant time period where injustice was the norm. It may just be one of the most important movies for the LGBTQ+ community.""

275,uomo_lupo,A Love Letter Flung Out of Space,10,1 December 2015,"Today we are flooded with content, especially an endless stream of movies. We consume films differently than we used to. A trip to the cinema is a rare occurrence. However, we still remember films from another time. We may or may not have seen them, but we would at least know what they are. At least someone would have told us at one point or another that it is a masterpiece. It becomes one when the talent, the means and the circumstances involved in the production all fall into place. There are no shortcomings. The acting, the writing, the directing, the production values, musiceverything works in concert to achieve a perfect balance. It's a rarity to see this achieved today. We can easily pick up on the shortcomings of most movies. The storytelling can be lazy. An over-reliance on CGI attempts to cover plot holes. The acting is woodenBut Carol makes me want to revisit her as soon as the credits have rolled, and I am about to see her for the fifth time.It is not just Blanchett and Mara who are luminous, sumptuously playing off each other like partners engaged in committing the perfect crime. The supporting players are excellent. Kyle Chandler welcomes sympathy as Carol's husband Harge who, despite and air of selfishness and concern for his own reputation, tries his utmost to keep his family unit together. Sarah Paulson is unforgettable as Abby, Carol's childhood friend and ex, who chooses to remain in Carol's orbit, to be there as her best friend, at all times, be they joyful or devastating. The rest of the cast, appearing in minor roles or as extras, many from Cincinnati, shed artifice and appear as real people, blending perfectly into the world of the film. Judy Becker's production design supplies post-war austerity, livid colors and authentic detail while Sandy Powell's costumes feel unique, stunning but also timely and lived-in. Shot on Super 16mm and lensed by Ed Lachman, Carol pays homage to great photography of the 50s. Shots through windows, condensation, reflection, light- and shadow-play evoke the work of Saul Leiter. Photographers like Ruth Orkin, Vivian Maier and Helen Levitt, among others, were also major influences. Lachman and Haynes also referenced Michelangelo Antonioni's L'Avventura, L'Eclisse and La Notte for their use of abstract and spatial relationships to enter their characters' minds. George Stevens' A Place in the Sun and David Lean's A Brief Encounter informed the point of view of the most vulnerable lover. Even Carol's editor Affonso Gonçalves shows restraint, lingering on silences, stoking our desire to witness a declaration of love between the heroines, just as Carter Burwell's sublime score swirls around them. It is as if Carol is a revelatory time capsule, drawing us deeper into her mystery and secrets, where a simple act of love comes at a staggering cost.Abandon everything. Right now. See if Carol is playing anywhere near you. See her by yourself, with friends, your family or someone special.

277,ranran_movies,"When watching Cate Blanchett's performance, who cares what the plot is?",8,31 January 2016,"Another LGBT film in this year's Oscar race, ""Carol"" may not have the historical reference and implication that ""The Danish Girl"" does, but the viewing experience is absolutely more satisfying.Nominated for Best Actress Academy Award, Cate Blanchett's performance is both charismatic and exquisite. It is difficult to distinguish whether Blanchett has become Carol, or vice versa. She is simply mesmerizing, but for the film as a whole, can be a double-edged sword. When Blanchett is on screen, she overshadows everything and everyone around her, even the plot of the film becomes insignificant.In the presence of the superb Cate Blanchett, Oscar-nominated Rooney Mara (for Best Supporting Actress) certainly holds her own. Her performance is a delightful surprise to say the least. As the doe-eyed young woman who was drawn Carol at first sight, Therese is the epitome of young innocence and courage fueled by love. Most of the film is told from her flashbacks, and it is through her eyes and lens that we realize falling in love with Carol was simply inevitable.The pace of the film is slow, as Director Todd Haynes takes his time with every eye contact, every pose, every dialogue. It's the culmination of these delicate moments that make the emotions all the more intense. In the final scene, as the camera cuts back and forth between Therese's gaze and Carol's smile, the connection between them is palpable; in that moment, their love transcends gender and social boundaries.",Carol
278,HSahay,"Carol Aird, an upper class woman going through a divorce, falls in love with Therese Belivet, a shop girl and aspiring photographer.",8,3 March 2016,"Carol is a romantic period drama set in the 1950s, adapted from Patricia Highsmith's novel The Price of Salt, a 1952 novel. The movie stars Cate Blanchett as Carol Aird, an upper class woman going through a divorce, who falls in love with Therese Belivet(played by Rooney Mara), a shop girl and aspiring photographer.Right from the get go, Carol has a definitive style and tone that is maintained throughout the film, one that is integral to both the story and the manner in which director Todd Haynes chooses to narrate it. The establishing scene where Carol and Therese meet for the first time, is one of the best examples of this, as complicated emotions of attraction, intrigue, and charisma are conveyed merely through glances and camera movement. This subtlety as both characters begin to understand and deal with their emotions and feelings for each other are key to the whole movie, and are continually accentuated by the cinematography and the set choices. 1950s Manhattan comes to life with a rather warm color palette, that would be familiar to anyone who's seen movies set in the 50s/60s. However, it does add on to the story by maintaining the subdued tone. The costumes are almost always breathtaking, Carol's fur coats accentuating her grace and class while Therese's dresses reflecting her youthful charm. Both the leads deliver commendable performances, which is the film's selling point, and again, something that Haynes seems to be aware of. This is obvious in the shot choices – where you see almost every scene that features a rendezvous between the two characters framed close to the actors, switching between them as they deliver their lines, focusing on their delivery and poise, which is supposed to speak and mean more than the words they are saying. For a majority of the film, this is also true of the interactions that Carol and Therese have with the other characters in the film, be it Carol's with her soon to be ex- husband Harge (played by Kyle Chandler) or Therese's with the men in her life. This works also because in all of these relationships, including the one between the two central characters, a sense of apprehension and hesitancy is visible at the surface, in some cases governing it completely. This is to be expected in a story which revolves around a relationship that is 'forbidden' in the eyes of the conservative time period. That, however, is not the only element of restraint that is key, as also important is the nature of these characters themselves, as they, especially Therese, come to terms with being in love with each other. While their relationship does blossom and eventually leads to physical intimacy , it is not until well into the movie and has little melodrama associated with it, unlike the usual narrative in films about challenging social opinion.While the characters do face challenges one would imagine arising out of an 'unorthodox' relationship, these are not the driving forces of the movie, but subplots that add to what is ultimately a film about the complex emotions associated with love.The plot wades through somewhat familiar territory, and doesn't seem to be the key element at work, but not something that would bother one much, mainly because the performances and chemistry between the leads is impeccable. The film also boasts a solid supporting cast, with Sarah Paulson featuring as Carol's friend Abby. However, the film does struggle to incorporate characters beyond the two leads (and the husband Harge) in a meaningful manner leading to a few scenes which seem to be extraneous. That, however, is a minor flaw in what is a quite strong technical movie, with (apart from the elements mentioned earlier) , a really good score. Having not read the book, this is mere speculation, but it seems likely that all of these choices that are intended to (and rather successfully) reflect a sense of subtlety are because emotions and conflicts are what govern the book, and translating that to film would be a difficult task without these tools. It's not something that's very easy to do, but thanks to both the performances and good direction, they do work.The film did create a decent amount of awards buzz, leading the pack towards the start of the season but ultimately failing to garner either a Best Picture or a Best Director nomination at the Oscars. It did however garner 6 nominations : for the two acting categories, cinematography, score, costume design, and adapted screenplay, winning none. While I personally rejoiced in The Big Short's win for the adapted screenplay category, having only seen Carol now after the awards does make me feel more conflicted about it. While Carol doesn't necessarily count as the best movie of the year for me (hopefully a list I'll manage to create soon after getting to everything on the watch-list), it's surely worth a watch. You'll like the film if subtlety works for you, or if you cherish really strong acting, but you might want to give it a skip if you tend to not like movies that aren't fast paced or that don't involve a lot of strong quick dialogue. Indeed, this film resorts to dialogue only when absolutely necessary.",Carol
279,Carmen1205,Beautiful and wonderful,10,19 March 2018,"Forget about the LGBT status of this film, it is so much more than that. In essence this is a mesmerising and deeply touching story of two people who are inexplicably drawn to each other despite the numerous social and circumstantial barriers standing in their way. Beautifully put together, amazing attention to period detail and a musical score that underlines and accentuates the characters' emotions. Cate Blanchett and Rooney Mara are incredible - their performances subtle yet so powerful and the chemistry between them is palpable, so much passing between them in just stillness and a look, that you ache for them both in different ways. Hand on heart this is one of the best films I've seen, not least because it reminded me of what it felt like to fall deeply in love with someone for the first time.

But, what makes it a great movie to me is that it depicts a love at first sight story and the main actors happen to be two women. It focuses on the connection between the two persons, but not the gender of the characters. This is the reason why it moved me. The storyline is simple: one person meets another person, fall in love and how to handle all the problems arise because of this relationship. But what is stunning in this movie is the acting of the two main actresses. Their actings make the story touching and worth watching.

Looks plenty repressed and stifled - but that is Todd's thing.I did not like how the shop girl pursed her lips all the time. The shortfall was in not showing enough of Carol's backstory to get fully engaged with, so her motivations aren't compelling. True love at first sight? Hard to buy into it, given the level of sophistication implied in Carol.The shop girl certainly did not bring much intellectual stimulation to the relationship, not enough to justify demolishing the good life and losing so much.Particularly, since on the surface (which is all we see) the husband appears to at least want to try and make it work.Sure, dinners with the in-laws are no picnic and grey flannel salaryman is boring but how far can a wild road trip through Ohio winter really go or last?We'll always have the Oak Room?",Carol
282,tyraskyles,Carol is the best movie with women in love,10,18 December 2015,"There have been made numerous films about the love between two women and this year's Carol is the best of all.Everything in this movie doesn't occur by luck, but only to reveal the reasons these two particular women fall in love.Carol and Therese don't have much in common, basically on their age and status, but together they share an intent feeling, which indicates that love has no logic.And in this, logic lies upon the love between people of the same sex. Nowadays, this phenomenon has started to escape from the stereotypes, but for thousands people it is still a stereotype. Let alone in 50s, where the movie is set.Carol risks it all to have Therese and loses her daughter, but through Therese she manages to replace the affection she misses from her own child.Carol felt imprisoned in her marriage and when she got disappointed from the cruel ways of her husband, she decided to return to a woman's lap.Carol realized that this is what she really wants and that is how Therese interpreted her own engagement to this story.Therese is a girl who doesn't know what she wants to do in her life and is astonished from the luxury of Carol, so she follows her, because she above all admires her. Therese is curious of Carol's superior life.She isn't really interested in boys and actually is experimenting on them in an attempt to understand herself. You can tell by the way she acts when she is by their side. She can't ascertain whether she wants to be with boys or not and eventually finds love in Carol.Despite their differences, Carol and Therese do have something in common: Both have tried to connect with men, but didn't succeed in feeling what they wanted and achieved that in the eyes of one another.Carol links Therese with her daughter. In the scene in Therese's house, Carol sees Therese in a picture, where Therese is in the age of her child, she remembers her daughter and cries.Therese goes to comfort her and that is what Carol expects from Therese: to replace the love of her child that she can't have because her husband took it from her.Therese sees Carol as a teacher and as more experienced and sure of herself, Carol is the one that makes Therese fall in love with her. Carol needed a strong feeling again after divorce and found it in Therese.There is also an unconscious connection with Carol and Therese that makes their relationship work even more.Through their experience, Therese reaches the level of Carol and Carol kind of falls into the level of Therese. Therese flourishes when she gets to know Carol better and seems to have a better psychology, while Carol loses it all.Despite the triumph of love, which theoretically is something jolly, the movie has music themes in sadness which make the story even more moving.Its sadness has to do with the treatment that women's love had in those years. It was almost impossible for two women to be together, so inherently the birth of such a feeling was a curse. Not in this piece, because of its value.The ending is a weird one and lets the spectator decide what he sees. Is it in Carol's fantasy or really Therese wants to be with her?",Carol

First thing of all, during the whole story we have the Christmas cozy mood: snow, coats, cigarettes, hot drinks, and well, a hot story. The most interesting thing about this film, is that you can feel two opposite things at the same time: you can feel the calm pace of the unwind, and how things are built, slowly and softly; but in the meantime you can feel Carol's and Therese's hearts craving for each other since the very first glance. Cate Blanchett is absolutely stunning acting as Carol Aird, an enigmatic and gorgeous mature woman; on the other hands, Rooney Mara is Therese, which is a cute and bashful young woman. When these two hearts collide, well, then the movie start to feel like a part of you, and you begin to love every scene of it.

The film is a love story of the most classic kind. There is nothing new or striking in the plot. It is as old as life itself. Rather, the film exquisitely, delicately, beautifully, romantically, artistically and heartbreakingly portrays two people falling in love and then facing the challenges that their love faces. The acting of the leads is, I believe, in a class far above the norm. It is inspiring and should, I believe, be aspired to.

But then I saw it again not so long ago with my school and I must say that I was absolutely blown away by it''s magnificence.The movie is really beautifully crafted and is worth watching more than two times to understand it at it's fullest. The effort that was put in subtleties as Todd Haynes is ally does in his films were here a really important element to the beauty of this whole movie. The small touches, lingering eye contacts and small talks were perfectly executed by the two amazing actress that are Cate Blanchett and Rooney Mara.Rooney Mara as the young reserved and unsure woman of the 1950's did a pretty good job and was easy to relate to. Cate Blanchett was as elegant and sophisticated as she could be, I honestly wouldn't have seen any other person other than her in this role. I like the fact that Kyle Chandles as Carol's husband character wasn't exagerating his reactions and facial expressions seemed as realistic as it could get in the daily life for a husband going trough a situation like he his, I had sympathy for him.There were many important issues here and they were all put nicely together and expressed the right way for us to understand it. The divorce Carol's going through, homosexuality and how women were treated in general in that time. The score was really nice and the style and setting were gorgeous, I felt like it looked pretty accurate to what the 1950''s in US were like.Most importantly, I liked the love story between Carol and Therese, it didn't seem forced at all and I the fact that they were two women didn't matter at all. It was just two people falling in love and being scared to totally give in and until the very end it stayed that way.

I didn't get it at the time and frankly speaking found it quite boring. But then I saw it again not so long ago with my school and I must say that I was absolutely blown away by it's magnificence.The movie's really beautifully crafted and is worth watching at least twice to understand it at it's fullest. The effort that was put in subtleties, as Todd Haynes usally does in his films, were here a really important element for the movie's whole plot and beauty. The small touches, lingering eye contact and small talk were perfectly executed by the two amazing actresses that are Cate Blanchett and Rooney Mara. We could see all the unsaid things between the two female lead characters and I was just here for it!Rooney Mara as the young, reserved and unsure woman of 1950's did a pretty good job and was easy to relate to, we could see why Carol saw her as an ""angel flung from space"". Cate Blanchett was as elegant and sophisticated as she could be. I honestly wouldn't have seen any other person than her in this role. I like the fact that Kyle Chandles as Carol's husband character wasn't exagerating his reactions and facial expressions. In fact, it seemed so realistic, like a real daily life husband was actually going through this situation.There were many important issues here and they were all nicely put together and expressed the right way for us to understant them. Homosexuality, the divorce Carol's going through, motherhood and how women were treated in general at that time. The score was very good and the clothing style as well as the movie's settings were truly amazing. I felt like it looked pretty accurate to what the 1950's in the US were like.Most importantly, I liked the love story between Carol and Therese. It didn't seem forced at all. It was just two people falling in love with each other and being scared of their feelings. Until the very end it stayed that way. We were shown just the right amount of love and affection to feel as if it was an authentic love story, it wasn't a cliché at all. Also, I just can't get over the end : a full of emotion ""I love you"" from Carol and a final look between the two lovers said it all, like it did in the beginning when Carol and Therese first met.",Carol

292,angie-karagounaki,A gorgeous movie with wasted potential,8,5 January 2016,"To paraphrase Ursula Le Guin: This is not Patricia Highsmith's book. This is Todd Haynes' film. It is a gorgeous film.I have only good things to say about this film, as far as aesthetics, atmosphere and film craft goes. The photography is stunningly beautiful and the use of colour is impressive and effective. The film manages to catch the perceived atmosphere of the Fifties and the romance of the script. The performances from both actresses are quite good, reminding of the old classics. The last scene, with its deceptively low-key acting, deserves to be included in an anthology.However, the film isn't perfect. I don't know whether this is the scriptwriter's of the director's fault, but the adaptation played too fast and loose with Patricia Highsmith's book, losing its essence. The delicate tensions and suspense of the book were gone and the film suffers for that, losing its potential impact and leaving behind an under-taste of disappointment.It is not a bad film, far from it, but I have the feeling that it could be far better and more powerful.",Carol
293,in-between-the-lines,"A gorgeous, subtle and beautifully crafted film!",9,6 July 2017,"The first thought that comes to mind after watching Carol is; ""Absolutely beautifully well crafted"". Carol is a gorgeous, subtly ground-breaking and an exquisite work of art rippling with mid-century melancholy. The film is a smorgasbord of edible fifties design, and finds meaning in the smallest of details. Cate Blanchett plays Carol,a struggling woman in the middle of a divorce, who falls in love with a young department store assistant; Therese, played by Rooney Mara. Therese is selling Carol a toy train as a Christmas present for her daughter. It's large so it must be delivered; and accidentally on purpose; Carol leaves her gloves behind on the counter. Before too long, Therese is invited to Carol's lavish home upstate, but her desperate husband (Kyle Chandler) turns up uninvited, and the Airds argue bitterly in the driveway. The acting throughout the film is superb. Cate Blanchett navigates the character of Carol Aird with a subtlety that is little short of phenomenal. Her hauteur and elegance matched with fear and self-doubt is utterly right, as we see Blanchett continually touching her face and stroking her hair as she speaks to Therese: a ""poker tell"" of desire. Roony Mara's Therese Belivet has something alien and blank about her, like a photo sheet not yet set in developing fluid. She is doe-eyed and callow, submissive yet watchful. Mara's rigidity as an actress is completely ideal in conveying this, in the sullen set she gives Therese's lips, the way she hunches in corners and seems scared and perplexed by every new feeling. The great Sarah Paulson gives a smart supporting performance as Carol's easy-going confidante and former lover Abby. And Kyle Chandler is superb as her furious left-behind-husband Harge. Carol is beautifully shot, and many of the most stunning sequences are inside cars, when they're alone, up close as they flirt, finding a symphony of reflections and hues bouncing off windscreens, thrilling to their potential together. The film shows us the restraint, subtlety and mystery with which gay people in the 1950s could manage their lives with dignity. But it also shows the depression and self-control into which Carol has had to retreat and from which she is now defiantly emerging. Blanchett has a scene trying to reason with Chandler's Harge in front of their lawyers, which lays bare the dismay of their lives so honestly it leaves you breathless. Once we've come towards the end of the film, and hear Carol's next act of pleading, it's cut short after the three most powerful words in the English language, delivered by an actress who couldn't possibly say them with more meaning. And that scene, like the film, is absolutely stunning!",Carol
294,cowfeet,"Subtle, beautiful",8,1 November 2015,"I loved this film for the subtleties. Lots of lingering, carefully framed shots and closeups. Lots of quiet scenes. Lots conveyed through looks and innuendo.Rooney and Cate captured what it's like to be nervous yet excited while falling in love. It felt real. It felt like two people unsure of themselves, offering up just a bit of their true feelings at a time and waiting for the other person to do the same before revealing more. Kyle Chandler's performance hasn't been commented on as much as the leads, but he was just as excellent. He played the part of tortured husband well without coming off as a mere villain. I sympathized with him and even understood where he was coming from.I thought the film captured the time period in a very unique way. Nothing was overtly flashy or Normal Rockwell 50s, and at times it even felt gritty compared to most depictions of the era, but it was really beautiful.The film stayed with me on the ride home, and I drove in silence while I reflected on it. That's how I judge a movie. If you are the type that loves character driven films, I'd very much recommend it. If you don't handle slow burn movies well, it might not be for you.",Carol
295,dominique1842,Oh Carol..,9,21 February 2016,"Carol is a stunning movie.The story of this movie is not very important. It is quite predictable and, in roughly the second half of the movie, threatens to overtake it, as it becomes a bit too present and its pace a bit too fast.But what is being shown is the very great merit of this movie. It shows in a magnificent way the unspeakable sensitivity and softness and power of being attracted to another person. Watching this movie is like dreaming the perfect dream of love, which one would like to last forever.I, for one, was overwhelmed.",Carol
296,jonesplus,Breathlessly captivating...,10,13 October 2016,"Kudos to the director and principle actors of this film for their ability to not only connect to and convey the nuances of the time period and the complicated emotions of the relationships, but to capture the look and feel of those classic movies of the 40's/50's film-making era. I feel like I could easily have enjoyed this in black and white, and that it maybe could even have benefited from it in a way.Both Cate Blanchett and Rooney Mara were fascinating to watch as they masterfully expressed volumes with a subtle gesture or a look that said more than a thousand words could have. Anyone who has ever felt that inexplicable and breathless attraction to someone else, which makes you question all that you thought you were, will understand and relate to what their characters were going through. The reactions of their male counterparts struck me as true, and the understated tension portrayed in the family scenes was palpable.(Possible spoilers) I love how we were made to understand the backstory of Carol and Abby's history without being overtly beat over the head with it, and how their genuine love and friendship had endured through thick and thin. The ending was brilliant, I thought, because we weren't spoon-fed a happily ever after scenario, just a ""maybe they found happiness with each other, or at least had a chance to explore it"", type of feeling. I will watch it again, because there are so many more elements that come into play; like the snow, the music and other fleeting subtle clues that might seem meaningless to someone watching just on the most superficial level.",Carol
297,navarreted028,Cate is just a powerhouse isn't she,8,11 May 2021,"I'm also not seeing enough about Kyle Chandler's performance. Where normally one could fulfill his role to be the subtly abusive, controlling husband, I instead really did sympathize with a man who wants his love for his wife reciprocated.Rooney and Cate created such a natural dynamic relationship and Cate takes it away with being just so damn powerful in her performance.",Carol
298,suaml,"I would have given it a 10, but...",4,15 February 2016,"...(maybe frankly) I've seen the french film 'La vie d'Adèle' (2013) directed by Abdellatif Kechiche. This movie had too many similarities and it just hurt me to know it caught the attention of many. Don't get me wrong, it's a good movie. The film's narration flow, the characters' chemistry, Cate Blanchett's sublime performance (Oscar nomination totally well deserved), the 50s vibes, the costume designs (which I believe it's worthy of the Academy's prize), and the list could keep going. So trust me, if I knew this was a truly innovative film, I'd give it a 10. 7.5 rating on IMDb, 95 Metascore, 93% in RT. I'd challenge to watch La vie d'Adèle to all the raters and critics of Carol and I would expect this movie's hype to drop drastically. I mean, I'm not here to promote the french film or to drag this movie down, but to truly give each film what it deserves. I appreciate both movies supporting gay marriage and all. But let me give you a list of resemblances. 1) The lesbian couple 2) The plot: both movies' couples get challenged that jeopardize their relationship (although Carol's, in my opinion, was too pretentious) 3) Carol's opening (and ending) scene: too similar to the coffee shop scene from La vie d'Adèle 4) Character's personalities: Emma and Carol as the dominant and prideful type, and Adèle and Therese as the submissive, shy, insecure, identity seeker person. 5) One specific shot where the camera shows the 'submissive characters' walking away on the street from La vie d'Adèle's last scene. 6) The ending: where they don't work out and miss each other, and see each other for the last time.I'm pretty sure people won't agree with this unless they've not seen both movies, and I obviously expect some hate, after seeing the ratings of this movie, but one thing I'm 100% positive about is this movie being an influence of the french masterpiece. I believe La vie d'Adèle deserves the attention Carol has been getting and that is why I gave it a 4.",Carol

300,malgorzatawozniak,Seduced by 'Carol',10,26 February 2016,"Based on Patricia Highsmith's novel 'The Price of Salt', Carol centers on the story of two women falling in love in early 1950s New York. The title character (Cate Blanchett) is a well-off wife and mother residing in New Jersey. In the search for the present for her daughter, this absolutely gorgeous blondish woman dressed up in a fabulous fur coat, is waited on by Therese Belivet (Rooney Mara), a young clerk at a department store. With Carol's daughter's chosen doll being out of stock, she ends up buying the train set for a Christmas gift. The two remain in contact because of the gloves that Carol (who knows if not deliberately) leaves behind.Unlike in the book, we don't see Carol only through Therese's eyes. Thanks to the beautifully introduced perspective shifts, the subjectivity arousing from the point of view is lessened. There are three worlds around us. First of all, there is Therese's world where she has a nice but definitely more emotionally invested in this relationship boyfriend Richard (Jake Lacy) who keeps insisting on taking her to Europe. She is surrounded by a group of friends and aspires to become a photographer. Then, there is Carol's world that reveals her relationships with her daughter Rindy, husband Harge (Kyle Chandler), friend as well as former lover Abby (Sarah Paulson) and Harge's family. This leads us to the story raising another important issue when Carol has to choose, owing to the perception of homosexuality and the sexism of this period, between having custody of a child and being with the loved one.The third world is the one that Carol and Therese share with each other. It begins with the meeting in the department store and results in a first lunch date, a visit in Carol's house and eventually departing on the road trip West. It's the world with waves of emotion sweeping over the two characters, the world that evokes our memories of falling in love or the world that makes us wonder what it feels like to be in love for the first time.Each world is filled up with a stunning grasp of color and light, a marvelous capturing of characters' profiles through the glass (Ed Lachman), a mesmerizing and touching soundtrack (Carter Burwell) as well as distinctive but reflecting the reality of that time outfits (Sandy Powell).Carol is not just a beautiful film with amazing performances, well- written screenplay, noteworthy direction, cinematography and costumes. It is also a project that required a great deal of investment among the people involved in it. It's hard to resist Cate Blanchett's words that the commitment to make this film see its daylight and the actual filming process constituted a real labor of love.",Carol

Especially loved the slow burning romance and the loved and passion filled looks they would send each other. I was very sad when it ended and I wanted more and more If you want something different instead of the same romance films that come out every year with just different actors, give this a watch, a truly beautiful film, that I won't be forgetting for a long time. I've never seen a Todd Haynes film before but after this amazing film I will definitely been checking out more of his work.

I love the subtleties in the facial expressions, eyes gazing and gestures, the silent and subtle interactions between the character of Carol and Therese. The film captures the essence of falling in love. It is a wonderful love story. It is difficult to write a review about this film without repeating what has been written already. There are so many excellent praises on this film and I agree to all of them. I have read the novel ""The Price of Salt"" that this film was based on. It is a good book, well written, like poetry. Phyllis Nagy did an excellent job on the screenplay for this film—Kudos to her. I read that it took a long time to make this movie, because of money, production, and so on. I'm glad no one gave up on it and it was made. Thank you, to all the cast and crew for making this film. It moved me. A must see!",Carol
304,taysheeer,Beautiful,10,2 May 2016,"his is easily my favorite movie of the year.Cate Blanchett and Rooney Mara really knocked it out of the park, and both of them deserve any accolades they receive. Blanchett was intense, and layered in a way that had me questioning exactly how to read her.It was so damn beautiful, too. I loved all of the shots through windows, and the dreamlike atmosphere when the movie took on Mara's point of view.It's a lot more conventional than what I've come to expect from Haynes, but I believe that it works for the subject matter. I can't wait to revisit it.EDIT: By the way, if anyone can help me out, I'm trying to remember the exact wording of a quote I found particularly moving. It was from Carol's letter, something along the lines of, ""You demand resolutions and explanations because you're young."" Thanks.",Carol
305,melinashingaling-77385,Boring,1,1 November 2016,"I did not enjoy this at all. It seems like we are being inundated by pro-homosexual films this year, and this is one among so many that have tainted or has forcefully invaded our visual stream. I watched it and did not enjoy the scenes or the story line. The brunette, love interest, did a poor acting job. Her face held no expression and she was incapable of carrying any scenes on her own. I would not recommend this film. I believe that some will defend this film for the sole purpose that it is a homosexual film and that is all the rage at this moment in history. I like to look at a film and judge it based purely on art and talent. This film was lacking and messy. I was bored near the end and had enough. Don't waste your time. There are other homosexual themed movies that are much better.",Carol
306,lreego,Just Didn't Feel the Connection,5,9 January 2017,"Let me start by saying that I really wanted to love this movie. Blanchett is always amazing. But Mara's performance just didn't work for me as I didn't find myself caring about her very much. Her sullen moodiness was annoying as it was never juxtaposed with laughter and light. She didn't ""come alive"" emotionally around Carol except for a few moments in their passionate scene.I also didn't find relationships to be real. It was style without substance. What did Carol really see in Therese that would make her risk losing her daughter? When her daughter was around, Carol would seem so involved and yet wouldn't go on holiday with them and then later in the film only visited her a few times. She didn't really fight for her. Why did Terese's boyfriend even like her? She certainly wasn't kind to him. And there were plot oddities: Why did Carol carry a gun? Her husband didn't seem as if he'd be physically harmful to her. And how did Therese expect to pay her rent and expenses when she returned from her trip with Carol? Where was Therese family during the holidays? She did have none? And getting a photography job at the Times especially as a woman in those days, wasn't that easy. Anyway, the cinematography was beautiful. I just wish the screenplay had been written with more opportunities to show the advancement of the characters and their relationships in a way that made more sense.",Carol

It was what we both wanted at that moment, and we loved it"" and so on. I think it would be more impactful. But I can say that I liked watching this movie.",Carol
308,Kali_elovephant,Beautiful film about two queer women falling in love in the 1950's,9,26 June 2018,"This is my favorite queer romance movie. The acting was amazing; I love both Cate Blanchett and Rooney Mara. They both were able to portray their characters in such a raw, authentic, beautiful way. You could tell that they both understood the story and their characters. The relationship between the two women was so tender and honest. Even though it is a story about two women falling in love, I do not think you need to be queer to like this movie.
 I also appreciated how subtle the film is. There is so much meaning in just a look or a touch. I thought it was even more meaningful than there being tons of dialogue because at that time there wasn't as much language around being LGBTQ+ like there is now. It made the dialogue all the more meaningful when they did speak. It really did feel like this movie could have been shot in the 1950's. I loved the cinematography and that they shot on real film. It really adds to the beauty and artistic nature of the film. I admire that how they filmed it made it so that you could see both of the characters points of view. I think this was very important so that you connect to both of the characters. In the novel by Patricia Highsmith called, A Price of Salt, it's all from Therese's point of view. Carol ends up being more of an object that Therese is infatuated with, rather than a real person. I enjoyed that they changed that; I think it makes the relationship and characters more authentic. I also loved that it ended on an optimistic note and that none of the queer characters were killed or portrayed as crazy. I would say that it's definitely a movie that you kind of have to understand how women and LGBTQ+ people were treated in the 1950's, otherwise you may not understand the characters or the story as deeply. It's also not a film for people who don't like subtly or who need a fast pace, action movie. This is not going to be that. I could say a lot about this film, but I think you should just give it a try. I'd certainly recommend it. You can watch it on Netflix or rent/buy it on Amazon.",Carol

I really don't like romantic films but I really like the fact that the film Carol talks about homosexuality because we can see in the film that is unacceptable to love someone who has the same gender as you (in 1953) is very a GOOD thing because maybe people can be open minded with this film . But I really don't understand why these actresses need to be naked in my opinion the film Carol would be better if they just play more like a seduction game but obviously it's only my opinion and my point of view but You need to watch this film ! It will be a wonderful experience !,Carol

The characters, the screenplay, the costumes, ... everything was perfect. Cate Blanchett is just awesome, beautiful and more charismatic than ever, in the company of Rooney Mara who plays Therese like nobody could have done. And what a story! These two women that are meant to be together just made me feel like there's no ""impossible love"". We are captured by all the tension of the movie, we really feel sad for Carol who risks losing her daughter just because she loves women but fights to keep her without denying who she really is. This movie makes us reflect about the fact that we have to be proud of who we are, who we loves and never give up for anything. Therese could have married a good man and lived a normal life, but she chose love and risk, and finally she was right to do that.
I don't have anything negative to say about this movie, except the fact that it's quite long but it doesn't matter because time goes very fast. I personally think that this movie deserves all the nominations it had and would have deserved prizes. So you really should watch this incredible and beautiful movie, trust me you won't be disappointed!",Carol

However after exploring context of not only the time but also aspects such as film form, alignment, spectator ship and ideologies this may be one of the greatest love stories to ever be told.The film form depicted throughout the film only enhances aspects such as mise en scene and the general aesthetic as a whole, we view a dark and dull exterior throughout the film conveying 1950s society and its impact upon individuals wishing to escape the boundaries of its society.The constant switch between imagery of men or imagery of 'perfect housewife's/women' or heterosexual couples only enhances the emotional impact of their ill fated love.The raw auteur style as depicted from Haynes stems from the repeated shots through glass, windows and cars. In the context of the time it was taken from a photographer and to me represents the lovers (carol and Therese) to only be together behind close doors - in this case a metal box. Although our alignment is constantly with Therese, we switch to carol emphasising the raw emotions of the story. In terms of spectatorship and ideology, some may like or dislike the film for many reasons - for one, Haynes will never be able to keep a 100% passive audience due to the fact (SPOILER) mothers may disagree with carols abandonment of rindi due to their personal bond with their children and view it as selfish.The film for me is an easy watch yet one with so many layers - just like an onion! It's one that upon the second watch you are elicited to so much more emotion in which is very rare! The film portrays so many sublime moments in which I have viewed as perfect if not flawless.",Carol

322,leosel,Not what you'd expect from a movie based on Patricia Highsmith's novel,6,7 February 2016,"What does one expect when the opening credits say ""Based on the novel by Patricia Highsmith (""Strangers on a Train"", ""Talented Mr Ripley"")? You expect a dead body. If not in the first part of a film, at least by the middle of it. We catch a fleeting glimpse of a gun at some point, but still no dead body. And finally the closing credits begin to roll... and still no dead body! Apparently, unlike her psychological thrillers, the novel the movie is based on (""The Price of Salt"") was not even published under Patricia Highsmith's name back in the 1950s. For obvious reasons - it's a love story between two women. Highsmith admitted to writing the book only some time in the 1990s.Don't get me wrong. I didn't dislike it - it's just I expected something different, something more. It's very stylishly made with stunning cinematography, grainy vintage look, moving performances. As one reviewer wrote, ""every glance means something, no strain shows"". And how come Rooney Mara's Oscar nomination is in the supporting actress category? Clearly, both she and Cate Blanchett are leading roles and share an equal amount of screen time. However, at almost two hours it's a bit too long for a film without a dead body. And it somewhat lacks substance. If it was a romance between two straight people, critics wouldn't give a toss about it. But because it's lesbian and we are oh-so-liberal today the movie has been hyped up beyond its worth. In a way, just like ""Brokeback mountain"", it's a gay movie for straight audiences.",Carol

How we had denied others the right to fully love someone and care for your own child in the eyes of the law. Carol gave up her share of custody (and trade it with regular visits) only to avoid dragging her daughter into their ugly embarrassing court process. How we were/are oblivious to how gender play additional hardship on the LGBT women who must fight for their place in the society. Music, gestures, and body languages spoke in a way that words can never describe. A master piece, if you see this film for what it is and fully realize what was there right in front of you.

It's treated with the same respect as any other romantic drama, and it's done better than most of them. The film is on another level when the two leads Cate Blanchett and Rooney Mara are on screen together. Both undoubtedly gave two of the best performances of the year.

329,mattlovesskittles,Brokeback Mountain sits in the shadows of the past.,9,8 March 2016,"As a gay man, I don't think in my 24 years of being on this earth I have ever been more moved than I was watching ""Carol"". After it was over I just sat there, thinking ""My God, they did it. They portrayed us as normal people who know how to love and finally we get a story where no one dies or is left heartbroken because that's the kind of love we deserve.""I didn't actually think all that in one sitting, all of that came later when I had more time to think. The beauty of the movie lies in every part of it: the outfits, the camera-work, the acting, the two actresses they chose for this forbidden love. It all falls together perfectly like a puzzle all of those LGBT filmmakers have been trying to go at for years. I'm not saying those other movies are bad, each of them in their own ways are good and respectable. But in the end they all dealt with it in that same old way, the way of the past. Make it known that these two don't belong together, show the bigotry and the death, one or the other.While ""Carol"" has moments where it almost slips into one of those clichés, it quickly realizes it and pulls out. That's what makes it great. It's not an agenda film, it's a film about love in its purest form.That's why I think I enjoyed it much more than I did watching ""Brokeback Mountain"". Although BM is a classic in its own right because it was the first major film of its kind, to me ""Carol"" trumps it because it's easier on the eyes, and it has a bigger heart.In my view, ""Carol"" will become a classic of Queer Cinema and cinema in general, if it isn't already one.",Carol

I am very critical about my lady loving movies, and the way Cate and Rooney portray their characters, and their on screen chemistry is absolutely breathtaking.Rooney and Cate captured what it's like to be falling in love. You'll get taken away with how this all develops and affects their lives. It's an easy-going, subtle movie but never gets dull, it keeps you hooked from beginning to end. Also the parts played by Sarah Paulson and Kyle Chandler are worth mentioning. It's been a while, if ever, since such a loving movie was released in this genre.",Carol

However, her character in this film left me feeling like she was nothing more than just some average rich woman who doesn't even know what she wants out of life except to toy with the emotions of the vulnerable. It left me borderline annoyed towards the last 40 minutes of it.On the subject of not knowing what she wants, the same can be said for Rooney Mara's character, and she even states she doesn't know what she wants out of life!The best part of this movie was the trailer. It told the whole story in 2 minutes instead of enduring two hours worth of lagging character interactions.Cinematography was great. It really set the mood for the period of the film as well as wardrobes, etc. But, all that aside, I give this one a just, plain, ""no"".",Carol

In order to appreciate the scenery, costumes, music score, great actors' performances and understand the theme, see it In a theater. The trailers are wonderful but seeing the movie gives them meaning; seeing it multiple times is better yet to see what you missed the first time.We grew up in the 50's and many items reminded me of those times: i.e. Carol's fur reminded me of my grandmother's; Shlitz beer was the beer of choice in our home (my father was the beer distributor of Shlitz in my hometown, and our family car resembled those used). My mother and father honeymooned at the Drake hotel in Chicago. Oh, and Roony's cap is the same plaid as a skirt I wore.We both enjoyed the movie thoroughly and hope to see it again and again; my husband said the only thing missing was the gentlemen not making room for Terese when she greeted Carol!",Carol

As for the acting, in my opinion Cate Blanchett gives a solid and convincing performance; there were moments when I only saw Carol and not the actress. Rooney Mara also gives a good performance, but it did not feel as genuine as Blanchett's. The supporting cast (Sarah Paulson, Kyle Chandler) also did well with the little time they were shown onscreen. In my opinion none of the dialogue felt unconvincing in any scene. I believe the characters would be more likable had they been given slightly more development. It is a good story, but definitely feels like there's something lacking. However, I suppose the subtly of the situations portrayed and how the characters react to them adds an element of realism. Overall, there is no such thing as a perfect film.

338,cotocobain,Julieta & Julieta,10,6 June 2016,"Synapse: New York, located in the 50's. Therese Belivet (Rooney Mara), a young woman who works in a shop in Manhattan who dreams of a better life, knows one day Carol Aird (Cate Blanchett), an elegant and sophisticated woman who is trapped in an unhappy marriage. Among them comes an increasingly intense and profound immediate attraction, which will change their lives forever.To sum it all, it is simple and correct to say that everything starts with a look.From the silence, calm and shyness that surrounds Therese, together with the strength and moderation of Carol, a perfect film, which is waving between the explicit and the insinuating is built.A sensually elegant and suggestive subtly told story, which catches us and takes us to a time where a relationship between two women was almost impossible. An intimate and deep history.This homosexual romance is played in such an elegant way, I think that even the homophobic entreat for this couple were together. For the maturity with which it is carried out, it radiates naturalness and normality that has to be presented topic. In my opinion I think that the film does not seek to show a history of homosexuality, but a story of love in difficult times, like Romeo and Juliet for instance.The story attacking us sensitivity, squeezes our hearts and keeps us expectantly. Indeed, I think one of the things that causes to see it, is just begging for them kiss once. For the character of Therese, as mentioned at the beginning, it represents a shyness that makes see fragile, and manages to stir us as teens stomach waiting for the first kiss.",Carol
339,kaitbroe,Never a better movie EVER.,10,20 January 2016,"All the right words have probably been used: stunning, mesmerizing, tantalizing. All these and the prepared for ""love that dared not speak its name"" set in the 50s are what we expect as we sit in the theatre. However, the words I came away with were not so headlight blinding on a dark night; rather, the stillness caught me. And when the stillness ended only the perfectly necessary, perfectly nuanced, movement captured my eye and held me spellbound into the next stillness. And the Silences. When did we forget how a silence can speak a thousand thoughts and ideas and notions? When did we lose ourselves in this cacophony of voices, unceasing, these incoherent noises? And how can this newly found silence find us yearning, not for words, no; instead, we beg, leaning forward in our seats, holding our breath, waiting or wishing or dying for another glance or equally as satisfying (but now almost universally neglected) another gentle, almost intangible - except from the disturbance of air around it - brush of a hand on a shoulder, and then gasping for air as it finally arrives? When did we lose the ability to interpret in a glance (and maybe a barely distinguishable lift of the corner of a mouth with the exact right shade of lipstick) across the department store floor an existence of unrelenting and profound loneliness, of desolation, of hopelessness? When did we lose the ability to say yes to life, and risk, and hoping the feeling in your gut is telling you this isn't the worst idea ever? Whenever we lost all these gifts: when we lost silence as an amplifier; when we lost the ability to translate a touch that speaks what we can't say aloud into ""I love you"" and ""I need you"" and ""I will be desolate without you;"" when we lost the ability to say with our eyes alone, ""you are the piece of me I didn't know was missing;"" when the choices were not an easily managed yes or no, but instead asked us the existence shattering, ""shall I give up my soul ... or my soul?"" I don't know when we lost all these gifts of communication, but I found them all here, watching a film in a small theatre in Santa Fe, New Mexico; and I was heartbroken and uplifted; terrified by the honesty and horrified by the cruelty in this world I was invited into; and yet, I am still loathe to go to another place, another time, where Carol and Terese are not speaking this language, where I am not the voyeur - the audience reeling with the profound reminders of how little we need speech, if only we commit to using every other sense to communicate. AFTER 3 Viewings: Three days ago, I noticed the silences and stillness and how in each moment of stillness and/or silence the actors' emotions/micro-expressions/silent communication is amplified. Every single movement, each touch, each look is devastatingly important. There is not one extraneous word, look, or moment in the entire film.Yesterday, I saw perspective. If you live in a world with little screen time, you find the world rarely looks at you with a straight back and a face looking directly at you. Instead, people tilt their heads, give sidelong glances, look over their shoulders. Well, this is what the DP and the Director give us in Carol. Real looks, glances over shoulders, wry smiles, longing through rain splattered taxi glass. We get a unique perspective while we watch Carol and Terese. And I was mesmerized. And then today it was the music. It is perfect. And by perfect, I mean, when you need it, where you need it, providing its own subtext while seemingly leading you along the way. It is stunning in its simplicity and yet, I cannot imagine any other film which could so seamlessly integrate the variety of moods and genres.Finally, making a film is a team sport. Maybe it's because Phyllis Nagy took her time and waited and worked on this script for decades, or maybe she wrote it in 6 sleep deprived, alcohol fueled days, chain smoking American Spirit Cigarettes. However it came about, this script is gold. Take that foundation, add Todd Haynes and all the crew plus the actors and you have alchemy at its very core. Cate Blanchett and Rooney together are so profoundly good at what they do, I found myself not at a film or play, but a voyeur watching a life unfold. And the story, as told by the team putting this film together, is possibly the most unnervingly true story ever told on film. And I am frankly at a loss how to go on now, knowing that I can't see the rest of it: the dinners, the relaxing into relationship, the constant conversation between Carol and Terese that involves no spoken words. I am devastated that I don't get to see the next Act, or even the next scene. And that, my friends, makes for an Oscar winner...",Carol
340,nykindaguy,Not Just Attraction to Women---No Good Men.,6,24 March 2016,"I was not surprised to find no likable (or desirable) men in this movie. And I actively looked for one. Yes, the movie was beautifully acted and filmed, but I've noticed that movies written by lesbians about lesbian relationships make a point of not only portraying characters who are attracted to other women, but of also taking care to have EVERY male in the movie be too coarse, too nakedly lustful toward women and so on and so on. Every male in this production was clearly of an inferior species. They lacked the elegant, quiet and confident approach to seduction and to the forging of an intimate relationship that only women had.Even Carol's ex-lover (a woman) remained a close friend. The viewer was left with no doubt that women are made of finer stuff than men. While the men in the lives of Carol and Therese got angry quick and tried to dominate women, the women in the movie (except for a supervisor type or two) were admirably generous and understanding toward other women. Men bad, women good.Writers and other filmmakers should be able to show us how some women love other women without having to go to such lengths to make all men look lucky to ever attract a women...or another man.",Carol
341,QuinnElyas90,Finally A Sapphic Romantic Film That Is Actually Amazing In More Ways Than One,8,14 October 2015,"If you have watched your fair share of lesbian movies, you'll understand the thirst for a lesbian love story that is well made and Carol pretty much is that game changer we've all been waiting for. I won't give away too many spoilers because this movie is already quite predictable. It's a love story set in the 1950's America where homosexual romances were obviously forbidden so things can't get anymore surprising than that. There are a couple little unexpected moments here and there that formed the overall arc regarding Carol's battle over the custody of her daughter but other than that, this movie is quite slow-paced. Though, I would note that that is a good thing. It is this slow revelation that makes several key scenes very rewarding. One of which was the love scene. Having read the book, I was already aware that it would be like that so it wasn't particularly a big deal for me.One thing I have always believed about this story just out of reading the book is that the storyline is quite simple. You have these two women falling in love with each other only to have a certain obstacle befall them but it is the complexity of their characters and what polar opposites of one another they are that feels the most intricate. Screenwriter,Phyllis Nagy did a great job honouring her late friend, author, Patricia Highsmith's book and it was evidently captured on screen with how much the movie felt like it was just as if though it had been any ordinary heteronormative film we see today.Then there's Todd Haynes. I have never seen anything he has directed before but I'm sure the hype is valid because the direction and overall cinematography of this film was simply magnificent and a pleasure to watch. I was completely enraptured by every scene. I know many people have raved about how gorgeous this film was and I can't add anything more to that because that is pretty much the only word that does it justice. Carter Burwell's score although repetitive at times was evocatively divine and meshed well with the era of the film. I would have loved if the piano theme song that played in the trailer had been in the film at some point.Cate Blanchett as per usual is marvellous in this role. She is THE Carol that I have read in the book and she handles her character with such dexterity, going from steely cold and intimidating to a hopeless romantic/passionate lover and then to a desperate mother fighting for her child with such grace and poise. Rooney Mara on the other hand is rather spellbinding in this although I am sure I could imagine someone else as Therese too if I wanted. It is probably the fault with the character as it dwarfs opposite Carol. The supporting actors are worth mentioning too as Kyle Chandler and Sarah Paulson never fail to impress each time they are on screen albeit how little screen time they both had. Which leads me to the ending and probably the most spoiler-ish part of the review. The ending is really the reason why this movie is getting plenty of Oscar buzz or so I think. It is the way that Todd was able to translate onto the big screen that crucial moment in the culmination of the story that left us, the audience speechless and wanting to know more when it cuts to black. The way he makes it feel like we were Therese looking at Carol and the way that he captured Carol looking over at her in those final close-on shots of her. My heart raced in that moment. It was only interpretive of one thing. A happy ending for a lesbian story that we have all been holding out for and it was done so perfectly.""That's that.""",Carol

Whether it is what we want to eat, what color we want to paint the room, or even what our favorite movie is. After tonight, I undoubtedly have made my choice about at least one of them. Carol is intoxicatedly real, passionate and classy. I feel empowered to believe in the impossible after seeing the enchantment enfold on the big screen, the costumes and set designs were made to accentuate the romance, and boy do they. Both actresses have a complicity that can't be faked and they are astonishing, lifting each other up in their acting. Cate Blanchett is incomparable, with a gaze of eroticism surrounding her at all times. The amount of guilt and compassion the viewers feel along their journey transcends all expectations. Carol barely touching Therese's shoulder, a caress of hands or quick glances across a room turn a movie into a masterpiece. The only downside is that it did not last forever.So, if someone asks me what my favorite movie is, the choice will be very simple from now on, and it will be Carol.",Carol

From the beautiful cinematography to the perfect direction, the stunning costume and set design to the spell bounding performances by both the leads and supporting cast. Carol is just...words can't even describe it. I'd read the book before seeing the film and loved it to the point were my excitement for the film slightly wavered as I didn't think it possible for the magic I found within the pages to translate with as much passion and pain on screen. Looking back, I had no worries. Cate Blanchett, like always, is beyond amazing and Rooney Mara, like always, is beyond fantastic. Todd Haynes directs the film in his usual brilliant beauty, truly capturing the 1950's with 16mm film, every grain taking the audience back in time. Phyllis Nagy's screenplay brings life to Therese Belivet and Carol Aird just as Patricia Highsmith intended, making us feel their struggle as they fight against society and the social ties pulling them apart. Carol is a story about love in a time when not all love was accepted and for a film such as this to even be made shows we have in fact come a long way since then. I recommend everyone see this film.",Carol
344,macguffin84,"Subtle, Excellent",10,21 December 2015,"Carol is my favorite film of the year. It is slow paced yet impeccably detailed in script and acting. As a film student I was constantly told about the merits of showing and not telling. Carol is quite a masterpiece in that nothing is ever explicitly stated until the last act of the story - it is instead hinted at and delivered through the strength of Mara and Blanchett's gazes at each other, in their deeply coded interactions and dialog, and in the cinematography emphasizing their respective distances from each other.The sparse dialog leaves space to observe how the characters approach each other...cautiously at first and never once being obvious. After all, in the 50's it was incredibly taboo to be in a same sex relationship of any sort. The spaces between their lines feel heavy, and almost uncomfortable in some ways. However this reflects the tension the characters must have felt in trying to calculate their interactions - parrying words to determine if the attraction is mutual.Not one moment or line of dialog is wasted in this film. Each shot and each line convey so much information that repeated viewings will likely reveal complexities that were missed on the first watch.I have quite a bit of admiration for the script as well as the acting. Cate Blanchett is a tour de force, and Rooney Mara is alluring and wonderful to watch. Mostly cautious and reserved, Mara's Therese will then make a short break into a smile or shy laugh, revealing a deeper sense that she has held herself back her entire life and is struggling to allow herself to fully break free.It's been a long time since a film has stuck with me days later, but Carol has done it. This is a story about falling in love, pure and simple, leaving behind the tropes and over the top drama that we so often find in films these days and leaving us with something simple, elegant, and real.",Carol
345,MonteBeragon,One of Todd Haynes' best,9,1 January 2016,"I urge anyone who loves classic Hollywood melodramas to immediately see ""Carol."" This movie reaches the same emotional intensity and visual beauty associated with the grand Hollywood tradition of the woman's picture. Like ""Magnificent Obsession"" and ""Mildred Pierce"", ""Carol"" casts a perfect balance between style and substance. It is a feast for the eyes yet deeply involving from start to finish.The ambiance and atmosphere of the 1950s is captured in a way that is utterly convincing. While the characters happen to be in a lesbian relationship, the theme of forbidden love is a universal one. Any sensitive person will be able to identify to some extent with the characters. The bigotry of the time is captured, but not in a way that comes off as overly cartoonish. This never feels like a caricature of the 1950s.My mouth stood open every time Cate Blanchett made an appearance on screen. She is an astonishingly beautiful woman, and her hair, makeup and clothing are some of the best I have *ever* seen in a modern Hollywood movie. It is impossible to take your eyes off of her. Rooney Mara's understated turn as Therese complements Blanchett's performance as grand dame Carol beautifully. They have a wonderful sort of understated chemistry that is truly a joy to watch.This is a must-see melodrama and an essential contribution to Todd Haynes' already impressive filmography.",Carol
346,gennicahugo,"For a film to achieve greatness in form and in content, Carol absolutely wins.",10,1 January 2016,"Carol, directed by Todd Haynes, captured many hearts of the audience. It is a film about pure love shared by two women of different ages and different worlds, hindered by the time and circumstances they were in. It's not just a gay film. It's truly a love story. Simple as it may seem, Carol leaves a huge impact that was carefully formulated primarily by the brilliant minds of Ed Lachman, Phyllis Nagy, Carter Burwell, Sandy Powell and of course, Todd Haynes. Lachman, as the cinematographer, guides you in every detail that you need to see. Every glance, every smile, and every gesture were highlighted in a way that makes the camera an observer's eye. That is one of the main goals of this film – to observe, secretly but closely. To observe how love blossomed between the two women while circumstances prevented them from doing so. Lachman further outdoes himself by successfully showing us the 1950's. The people and environment surrounding the two main characters were captured very well, giving us a taste of what it felt like during that particular time.Carol's screenplay was written twenty years ago and there were about two failed attempts of making the film. Phyllis Nagy got cold feet and once decided to not push through with the film anymore. Huge thanks to the people who convinced her to give it a shot again, because otherwise, we would not have witnessed the magnificent adaptation of Patricia Highsmith's The Price of Salt. Nagy's screenplay was faithful to the book and was able to make us feel what Highsmith would really have wanted us to feel. The main thing that made the story richer was adding Carol Aird's point of view. In the novel, everything that happened was shown through Therese's eyes. In the film, Carol was given her own voice thus letting the audience clearly see the differences of their perspectives and the similarity of the weight of their sacrifices. Nagy chose to end Carol similarly to how it ended in the book and that was one of the most heart gripping moments in the film. To say that almost all scenes were heart gripping is not an exaggeration. With Carter Burwell's soundtrack, the film transports you into a place and time which lets you feel the gravity and reality of the situation you are seeing. The effect is not forced, but gradual, leading you on, and satisfying you afterwards. As one critic mentioned, Burwell's soundtrack transformed Carol and Therese's flirtations into sex. Nothing can beat that. Another magic that was put into the film was Sandy Powell's costume design. Carol was breathtaking in every scene, even the ones when she was swearing and crying. The obvious difference between Carol and Therese's way of carrying themselves shows how they came from two worlds apart. They were not the only ones who were shining in their costumes, but also Abby and Harge, Carol's best friend and ex- girlfriend, and her husband, and basically everyone you can see in every frame. Leading this brilliant ensemble is Todd Haynes who once again proved that he is one of the industry's greatest directors. Haynes crafted his masterpiece in a very subtle manner, slowly creating a huge impact that would leave you silently taken by the film for hours, days or even weeks after you've watched it. It's haunting because it was shown in a way that made it so real, which is how it should be. Haynes' direction of Cate Blanchett and Rooney Mara was beyond beautiful. Blanchett was consistently magnetic. She could make you fall in love with a stare. Mara's portrayal of Therese effectively showed the character's innocence and her journey towards self- discovery. Haynes' depiction of the two women's love scene was one of the best parts. It was very evident that the director wants the audience to witness something that is full of respect, pure admiration, and love. Haynes obviously wins in this part.Last but definitely not the least, the glorious cast ensemble deserves great recognition. The chemistry between Cate Blanchett and Rooney Mara was so natural that it would make you wish you can know for sure that Carol and Therese definitely ended up together. It seems like you grow closer to them as the film progresses. Another thing is the fact that they looked so timeless. They can be imagined in another era together and they would still look as perfect as they are in the 1950's. Sarah Paulson and Cate Blanchett's chemistry was also remarkable. They are the kind of former lovers that you would still want to see as good friends because of the obvious fact that one cannot survive without the other. It was lovely to watch them talk about their personal lives and lovers, without awkwardness or bitterness, but just pure love and acceptance. Carol is a legacy. And the film being a masterpiece is not the only reason behind that. Its underlying message that lets the audience think about the situation sixty three years ago, when there were a lot of women who were like Carol and Therese, loving each other in spite of what the whole world thought of them. Without these women, their voices and struggles, we won't have any amount of freedom and acceptance today. They made sure that our generation would have the liberty to love and for that, they would always be dearly remembered. For a film to achieve greatness in form and in content, Carol absolutely wins.",Carol
347,fretrostein,"Beautiful, Encompassing Portrayal of the Sadness and Hope of Involvement",10,9 January 2016,"This was melancholy, lush, and resonant, all with gentle restraint from showing off the quality of the sets, costumes, actresses, direction, etc. The movie also avoids being voyeuristic, even with the inclusion of a privacy-violation plot-line regarding the romantic (and sexual) lives of the main female characters. Complexities such as Carol's divorce, Carol and Therese's age differences, and ex-interests are covered with both grace and reality which makes the whole film feel emotional - across a spectrum of being heartwarming and heartbreaking - even at its resolved, triumphant, and warm moments. The movie seems to mostly rely on emotional drive, in fact, with the eventual sex scene being both very respectful and serving a purpose to the story (not that plot point status is entirely necessary in a movie, but seems like it is here in choosing why it is disclosed to us) and with the technical components of life being factored into the plot through their emotions, such as in Therese's hesitation to leave NYC with her boyfriend, in Carol's divorce and custody battle, in Therese's career aspirations, each of which are included to color the emotional states of the characters involved at each part of the story-telling of this relationship's time-frame. The movie also is assuredly beautiful in a more general sense, with vivid performances and great costumes, sets, shots, and music. The framing of the story is also artful, especially given the clunky or underwhelming nature of many romance movies' beginning and ending territories. Also, for the record, I am queer and much of the poignancy and spark of this movie related to a relationship I had with a woman for much of the past year; I was wary of this movie but found it to tell a humanizing and beautiful story, while also resonating with me more than other bittersweet love stories have since my breakup, which may seem irrelevant but I mean to say that I would recommend this movie to anyone and don't believe the people who worked on this have mistreated the subject matter of a relationship between two women.",Carol

Not only are the performances exquisite, but so is the cinematography, the score, the direction...simply everything. It's a subtle film, but with each passing frame your swept into the story of attraction played out mostly through rich subtext. Blanchette and Mara are perfectly cast and it's a marvel to watch their characters transform through the course of the film. What's also marvelous is the way in which the perspective changes along with the each character's journey.Todd Haynes deserves much praise for his vision and deft hand with a love story that will move you and linger long after the credits fade.",Carol

350,verdmont,"""Carol"" snubbed at BAFTA",8,16 February 2016,"Good fairy and peripatetic MC, Stephen Fry described the movie ""CAROL"" as a 1950's story of a New York woman who goes to a department store to buy a train set and comes away with a train set plus shop girl thrown in. It seems, in relation to ""CAROL"", that Stephen and I saw a different movie or perhaps it was the same movie seen from different vantage points, he being very tall and beloved, and I being very short and not in the slightest bit tolerated. In any case, the movie I saw was about a woman who loved her daughter so much she wouldn't let her be held to ransom in a vicious morals based divorce case, but rather let the young child go, realising that to be true to her own nature and to go with and not against her own grain, would provide that daughter with a potent moral example of what a woman and mother could and should be in the twentieth century and beyond. I must admit ""CAROL"" was a bitter pill for me to swallow – for largely personal reasons. More than one quarter of a century after this film is set, a woman I had once known perhaps as close as a socialite and a shop girl, lost custody of her children in a similar based custody case, in Australia – she living at the time openly with a woman, and her former husband, who brought the custody case, having ""found religion"" and a naïve new wife, whilst, on the sly, maintaining his own boyfriend in a flat attached to his family home. I don't like being reminded of this, nor of how far some people will go in order to win – hence my reluctance to see the movie. But, that's not the fault of ""Carol"", a film that has spent far too long in coming to our screens. ""Carol"" started as a 1952 Patricia Highsmith book, ""The Price of Salt"", a bestseller that was ahead of its time. The film seems now to stand accused of being a bit behind the times - its script, written by the wonderful, and succinct, Phyllis Nagy, having been circling LAX in a holding pattern for the better part of 20 years. Personally, I don't have a prejudice against ""Period"" films, especially the period 1952, my birth year – in my experience, people don't change, only costumes do, and even costumes get recycled, Just ask ANGELS Costumiers. Neither do I have a prejudice against Queer cinema – why would I not want to see stories which reflect my own life experience, even if poor scripting, B grade actors and dodgy production values have often made me squirm in my cinema. Heck, as a woman, and a lesbian, I've had a lifetime of paying more for second rate product and service, for which I'm expected to turn myself inside out with gratitude. I stress that, in my opinion, ""Carol"" DOES NOT fall into this category, nor does anyone associated with this film. Some opinion has it that ""Carol"" is a cold and inaccessible film. It has been said that the film, along with Queer cinema generally, employs some Queer sub-dialect that makes it inaccessible, and thus unsympathetic, to outsiders. And that's clearly our fault, as Queer filmmakers. I don't sympathise with this viewpoint. Though I do agree with the Australian Poet, Dorothy Porter, author of ""The Monkey's Mask"" – book and movie- who once said that we LGBTI people are different, are not the same. It's not as if we Queers are talking, writing and filming in cuneiform - we all use Lingua Franca. If you don't get it think Marcel Marceau and viewer/critic take personal responsibility for your own lack of sympathy and engagement. ""Carol"" is an uncommon Christmas Tale, and, unlike a Christmas cake, parts of it may be difficult to swallow and even harder to digest. The success of its transformation from a 1952 book to a 2015 film depends largely on the strength of casting, and the uncommon talents of the women who play Terese Belavit and Carol Aird and both of these actors have been much nominated but barely gonged for their roles in this movie. The wide-eyed, super engaging Rooney Mara, who put in such a ballsy performance in ""The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo"" did not disappoint me as a girl on the cusp, and must be a shoo in for the lead in any future Audrey Hepburn biopic. And then, there's Cate Blanchet, who has been previously directed by Todd Haynes in the movie ""I'm Not There"", a rumination on the life of Bob Dylan. Todd Haynes, perceptively, said that he had directed Cate Blanchet in the role of a man and in ""Carol"" he looked forward to seeing if she could play a woman. Cate Blanchet is not an actor whose career I have followed with great attention or passion. Prior to ""Carol"", I confess the only image I retained of her in the mid ground of my mind was a glimpse of her prosthetic elfin ears as Queen Galadriel. I guess her beauty, bearing and intelligence must have registered somewhere in the back of my mind, but in an attenuated form, like light from a long gone supernova, registered by radio telescope and explicated and argued over by unknown academics in abstruse equations. So I went out of my front door to look at a movie, much as I occasionally walk out of my front door to look at the night sky above my farm, expecting to see familiar stars in familiar places, predictable Venus, Orion's Belt, and expecting nothing much and nothing more after a lifetime of snubs the like of which you could not conceive. And, expecting nothing, unexpectedly saw in Carol Aird's hooded eyes, in Cate Blanchet's hooded eyes , the dark matter that holds our universe together.",Carol
351,helen_johnson-03722,Beautiful and dull,4,21 March 2016,"I'm glad there are plenty of negative reviews on here, because I was beginning to wonder what was wrong with me after hearing all the praise from the critics. Yes, it all looked very beautiful, but I wasn't impressed by either of the lead characters, who seemed to have one facial expression each: Carol - smouldering, slightly amused and pouty; Therese - innocent, wide-eyed and pouty. I didn't sense any chemistry between them, got no sense of inner turmoil or the difficulties of social pressure, and couldn't feel any empathy for them. I know I wasn't the only one; the cinema was packed when I went and there was a collective groan and mutterings of 'Is that it?' when the film ended.",Carol
352,margaridapn,Thoroughly entrancing,8,21 March 2016,"The kind of movie that makes you an enormous emptiness when it comes to the end. Thoroughly entrancing.story with a slow pace, but that grabs the viewer from beginning to end, without even allowing a detour to look at. Intriguing, mysterious and dominant; Cate Blanchett (Carol Aird) takes a brilliant performance. The chance or whim of Carol, came to become a love story that carrieth away her without she never imagined the power of a feeling that raised almost in silent. This film has succeeded in producing the most intense silence I have ever seen. Almost the surrounding feeling needs no words to convey the brightness that accompanies it. The minute details reveal all we need to hear; breathing, cigarettes, look, especially the look. the soundtrack fits perfectly; elevates the film to another level. It allows us to imagine all the history during the drive, in the restaurants, in the hotels. We cease to miss the dialogue because the music together with the chemistry between Carol and Therese is absolutely incredible.",Carol
353,viktorijamarsic-75584,Full Circle: Understated and Overrated,8,22 March 2016,"The film Carol is lovely. Not only is it a faithful adaptation of The Price Of Salt, but it's also an improvement in some ways. I'm still haunted by the mesmerizing soundtrack (I think it richly deserved an Oscar). But I actually didn't like the film much at first. After my initial viewing, it left me mildly disappointed and feeling empty. Wanting more, somehow. It took me a couple of viewings to truly appreciate all the nuance. Gestures, looks, and touches carry enormous weight. I finally realized I adored the film during the last few frames through until the end, when Therese is gazing up at the night sky, filled with anticipation, hearing the distant clamour of a train, and we see her emotions written so strongly on her face. This film literally lives and dies through the eyes of its characters. Carol includes lines that were not in The Price Of Salt (particularly Carol's heartbreaking and heartfelt letter to Therese after Waterloo, reminding her that ""there are no accidents""), which add a new level of depth to the rather simple story. And without a doubt, Cate Blanchett and Rooney Mara are the personifications of Carol and Therese. I was able to set aside my own reservations of love at first sight and my distaste of their age difference because I allowed myself to acknowledge that their relationship just works in its own unusual way. Yet I couldn't help but ask myself, ""why?"" This is the central burning question in the novel, and the only answer we get is that Carol happens to reciprocate that love. They are intrigued by each other; we are supposed to just accept this. Interestingly, the reason for such strong love (their la foudre if you will) is ultimately not as important as what they do about it. It's enough that we experience the moments they love each other. In the film, I particularly enjoyed the Lincoln Tunnel sequence because so much is conveyed through their lingering gazes, and we are allowed to judge them later by their actions which speak far louder than the few murmured words between them. However, the film also suffers from its own understatement. It's meticulously and adoringly crafted, yet through the process, some of the essence of the novel is lost. I wanted more explicit development between Carol and Therese. I can tell they've changed by the end, but I don't entirely see why. There are examples of what they mean to each other (Carol buys Therese a proper camera because she knows her old one is not suitable for an aspiring photographer, Therese paints her apartment the same colour as their hotel room in Waterloo, she refuses Carol's invitation to live with her at first, thereby establishing her agency, but then realizes she truly wants Carol). These are touching moments, but they are not readily apparent. They are not strung together in an emotionally moving. coherent sequence; piecing this film together is a little frustrating because the emotional payoff is delayed. While this is not a boring film, it is also not quite as electrifying or engaging as it could have been. Overall, there is a pervasive sense of something missing when it comes to Carol and Therese, and not all of it can be conveyed through lingering gazes; there are times when style replaces substance, and paradoxically seems to rely on the viewers prior knowledge of the Price Of Salt. Claims that this is the best film of 2015, even the best LGBT film ever, are simply overrated, because they are not based on the film's overall effect, but what it could have been. It could have been spectacular, and instead it is simply dulcet and leaves a subdued impression, like a shy bullet. Despite its limitations, Carol is an enjoyable film though. I personally prefer to view it as a collection of poignant moments, culminating to a hopeful, positive ending. Indeed, as Therese notes in the novel, their relationship is merely a beginning, It is hopeful. We are its viewers; may not agree with Carol and Therese's choices, but we are glad we get to witness them.",Carol
354,chumpy-10538,Horrible. Boring. No plot. Just actresses who stare,1,3 May 2016,"this has got to be the worst worst movie I have ever purchased or watched. Don't even waste a minute of your time. I couldn't even get through the first 10 minutes which is spent on Rooney's boring face.. then we go to Kate Blanchett's boring face. The dialogue is worse than plebeian boring and the focus is on their faces. who wants to watch 2 hours of an actress staring into the screen. there is nothing appealing, nothing engaging, it is a dud!! come on movie makers, entertain us. Kate Blanchett is such a good actress. Give her some dialogue other than ""thank you for sending me my gloves"". It is not even clear why these two women are attracted to each other. I presume the director thought that their eyes was going to convey the plot versus a dialogue. There was an interesting scene at the end though with Kate Blanchett's eyes. They are magical.",Carol
355,lilmushroom-87379,Loved it,10,11 July 2016,"I absolutely loved this movie. I loved everything about it. There was incredible amount of work put into it, which is translated across the screen. There is so much emotion: so much passion and fear of the unknown, fear of not knowing yourself and discovery. There were many speechless moments of just gazes and looks, and I loved that, because sometimes silences are louder than words. I totally recommend, because although it tells the story of a lesbian love and a new experience in the 60's, overall I think the language of love in this movie and its power makes it universal and anyone who's fallen in love for the first time can relate to this. It has a lot of personal character definition, which is played really well by Cate Blanchett, who looks so sophisticated, confident, yet somehow, in her own way, insecure. And Rooney Mara who is young, who is new to this feeling of love is brilliant, her reactions, her words, the way she says things - amazing! I think Todd Haynes did a lovely job! You can really feel the atmosphere of life, the speed or life back then - all the little details are there. This film is going onto my shelf of all time favourites!",Carol
356,thesecretoflife,"An elegant, whispered narration",7,24 July 2016,"In the frame of a 1950's New York City immersed in a mellow and hazy winter holidays atmosphere, Carol (Cate Blanchett) is looking for the perfect Christmas present for her 4-year-old daughter at Frankenberg's store in Manhattan. While examining a train set put on display in the busy store, Carol suddenly locks eyes with a young shop girl, Therese (Rooney Mara). Carol approaches Therese and the two women engage a friendly conversation, at the end of which, Carol decides to buy the train set for her daughter and then leaves the shop forgetting her gloves on Therese's counter. The early 50's background is recreated with striking accuracy and refinement, particularly the attention for details in the choice of costumes makes them an essential interpretation key of the characters. Carol's elegance is unquestionable; her sensuality in tailored formfitting sheath skirts and stiletto shoes is involuntarily oozing at every step, together with a certain sense of upper class containment, while her translucent pallor makes her resemble a porcelain doll that could easily break at any moment if not handled with the utmost care. On the other hand, Therese's unripe beauty is made up of modest cardigans and circle skirts, evasive looks and timid smiles. She hides herself behind her camera, while coyly caressing the idea of becoming, one day, a professional photographer, and elects Carol as her model and muse. In fact, Therese initially seems to look at Carol more as a role model than as an object of desire, in that confused way adolescents can mistake a strong admiration for love.When the two women start seeing each other regularly, Carol has an active role in every decision made, while Therese lives the events unfolding with some sort of languid passive acceptance. At one point, after the first sexual encounter with Carol in a hotel room in Waterloo, Therese openly describe herself as a confused individual that doesn't really know what she wants and always says yes to everything. She appears to be a young woman at the mercy of her own fleetingness in the search for herself, physically carried back and forth on the passenger's seat by other people's desires like a feather in the wind. The themes of family, womanhood, motherhood, public image in juxtaposition to private life and homosexuality presented in the film are filtered through the lens of a 1950's American conservative society. Carol's inner struggle with accepting or revealing her homosexuality is made even bigger by the violent clash with her status of mother and wife going through a divorce. Her homosexuality is used by her husband as a means to obtain exclusive custody of their daughter (on the grounds of a so called ""morality clause"") and is eventually treated as a mental deviance to be corrected through psychotherapy as the only way for Carol to obtain a shared custody of the girl. While Carol's character is pretty much consistent from beginning till the end, showing that she knows herself and what she wants, Therese goes through a transformation, which becomes evident on the inside as much as on the outside: in the latest scenes, Therese's clothing, hairdo and makeup are more adult, elegant and sophisticate, nearly a reference to Carol's style, delivering her new more aware and confident self. It feels, in a sense, like the real story is the one yet to be told, like the one true intent of this movie was to defend the dignity of love through a narrative that is whispered rather than shouted out, an elegant choice which perfectly reflects the consistent delicate, although allusive and slightly flirtatious, feminine allure of the whole film.

357,bananamilkstan,more of a synopsis,10,17 April 2018,"I think they were drawn to each other the first time they met in the store, the first moment their eyes caught, Therese was behooved. And it shows that carol was attracted to her when she started asking her personal questions. Like ""what did you want when you were 4?"" And it seems like no one asks Therese these kind of questions judging by the way her eyes refused to meet carol's. Carol was eyeing Therese every moment she could get just to savior her, or rather, the moment. And she wanted to see her more. So I think she left her gloves there on purpose just as an excuse to see her again. When they went out for lunch, their chemistry is so well after only a few minutes of conversation, Carol was so willing to know about Therese. you could tell that carol was kind of suspicious of Therese's sexuality when she said that she was a. ""Very strange girl"". And that she was ""out of this world"". After that, they show a scene where Therese writes Carols name and when she first met her. I think that means that she likes would like to remember her.that moment where she went to the Times office with her friend, and when they were talking about attractions, I think that opened her mind a bit. You can't help but think that they've shared a pretty special moment in the car, and Therese would probably think that she REALLY wants to capture carol, not just her beauty, but her kindness, along the fact that she's the first person she ever takes a picture of, she's that special to her already . And when they're back home, she can't help but think that she's also a good mother. When Therese's playing the piano and carol comes and just puts her hands on her shoulder, She becomes a little tense, it's either she's realizing her attraction or no one has touched her that gently before. She gets flustered whenever carol asks her personal questions.She witnesses the fight that happens outside between harge and carol and she just highers the volume, respecting their privacy.When she's taking Therese back to the station in the car, you can see how miserable carol looks. And how helpless Therese feels, therefore she cries in the train because she just feels like it's her fault, that she wants to make carol feel better and all.",Carol
